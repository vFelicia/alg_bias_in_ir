on morn when gregor samsa woke from troubl dream he found
himself transform in hi bed into a horribl vermin he lai on hi
armourlik back and if he lift hi head a littl he could see hi
brown belli slightli dome and divid by arch into stiff section
the bed wa hardli abl to cover it and seem readi to slide off
ani moment hi mani leg pitifulli thin compar with the size of the
rest of him wave about helplessli as he look
what happen to me he thought it wasnt a dream hi room a
proper human room although a littl too small lai peacefulli between
it four familiar wall a collect of textil sampl lai spread out
on the tablesamsa wa a travel salesmanand abov it there hung a
pictur that he had recent cut out of an illustr magazin and
hous in a nice gild frame it show a ladi fit out with a fur
hat and fur boa who sat upright rais a heavi fur muff that cover
the whole of her lower arm toward the viewer
gregor then turn to look out the window at the dull weather drop of
rain could be heard hit the pane which made him feel quit sad
how about if i sleep a littl bit longer and forget all thi
nonsens he thought but that wa someth he wa unabl to do
becaus he wa us to sleep on hi right and in hi present state
couldnt get into that posit howev hard he threw himself onto hi
right he alwai roll back to where he wa he must have tri it a
hundr time shut hi ey so that he wouldnt have to look at the
flounder leg and onli stop when he began to feel a mild dull
pain there that he had never felt befor
oh god he thought what a strenuou career it is that iv chosen
travel dai in and dai out do busi like thi take much more
effort than do your own busi at home and on top of that there
the curs of travel worri about make train connect bad
and irregular food contact with differ peopl all the time so that
you can never get to know anyon or becom friendli with them it can
all go to hell he felt a slight itch up on hi belli push himself
slowli up on hi back toward the headboard so that he could lift hi
head better found where the itch wa and saw that it wa cover with
lot of littl white spot which he didnt know what to make of and
when he tri to feel the place with on of hi leg he drew it quickli
back becaus as soon as he touch it he wa overcom by a cold
shudder
he slid back into hi former posit get up earli all the time
he thought it make you stupid youv got to get enough sleep other
travel salesmen live a life of luxuri for instanc whenev i go
back to the guest hous dure the morn to copi out the contract
these gentlemen ar alwai still sit there eat their breakfast
i ought to just try that with my boss id get kick out on the spot
but who know mayb that would be the best thing for me if i didnt
have my parent to think about id have given in my notic a long time
ago id have gone up to the boss and told him just what i think tell
him everyth i would let him know just what i feel hed fall right
off hi desk and it a funni sort of busi to be sit up there
at your desk talk down at your subordin from up there
especi when you have to go right up close becaus the boss is hard
of hear well there still some hope onc iv got the monei
togeth to pai off my parent debt to himanoth five or six year i
supposethat definit what ill do that when ill make the big
chang first of all though iv got to get up my train leav at
five
and he look over at the alarm clock tick on the chest of drawer
god in heaven he thought it wa half past six and the hand were
quietli move forward it wa even later than half past more like
quarter to seven had the alarm clock not rung he could see from the
bed that it had been set for four oclock as it should have been it
certainli must have rung ye but wa it possibl to quietli sleep
through that furniturerattl nois true he had not slept
peacefulli but probabl all the more deepli becaus of that what
should he do now the next train went at seven if he were to catch
that he would have to rush like mad and the collect of sampl wa
still not pack and he did not at all feel particularli fresh and
live and even if he did catch the train he would not avoid hi
bosss anger as the offic assist would have been there to see the
five oclock train go he would have put in hi report about gregor
not be there a long time ago the offic assist wa the bosss
man spineless and with no understand what about if he report
sick but that would be extrem strain and suspici as in five
year of servic gregor had never onc yet been ill hi boss would
certainli come round with the doctor from the medic insur
compani accus hi parent of have a lazi son and accept the
doctor recommend not to make ani claim as the doctor believ
that noon wa ever ill but that mani were workshi and what more
would he have been entir wrong in thi case gregor did in fact
apart from excess sleepi after sleep for so long feel
complet well and even felt much hungrier than usual
he wa still hurriedli think all thi through unabl to decid to
get out of the bed when the clock struck quarter to seven there wa a
cautiou knock at the door near hi head gregor somebodi calledit
wa hi motherit quarter to seven didnt you want to go
somewher that gentl voic gregor wa shock when he heard hi own
voic answer it could hardli be recognis as the voic he had had
befor as if from deep insid him there wa a pain and
uncontrol squeak mix in with it the word could be made out
at first but then there wa a sort of echo which made them unclear
leav the hearer unsur whether he had heard properli or not gregor
had want to give a full answer and explain everyth but in the
circumst content himself with sai ye mother ye
thankyou im get up now the chang in gregor voic probabl
could not be notic outsid through the wooden door as hi mother wa
satisfi with thi explan and shuffl awai but thi short
convers made the other member of the famili awar that gregor
against their expect wa still at home and soon hi father came
knock at on of the side door gentli but with hi fist gregor
gregor he call what wrong and after a short while he call
again with a warn deep in hi voic gregor gregor at the
other side door hi sister came plaintiv gregor arent you well
do you need anyth gregor answer to both side im readi now
make an effort to remov all the strang from hi voic by
enunci veri carefulli and put long paus between each
individu word hi father went back to hi breakfast but hi sister
whisper gregor open the door i beg of you gregor howev had
no thought of open the door and instead congratul himself for
hi cautiou habit acquir from hi travel of lock all door
at night even when he wa at home
the first thing he want to do wa to get up in peac without be
disturb to get dress and most of all to have hi breakfast onli
then would he consid what to do next as he wa well awar that he
would not bring hi thought to ani sensibl conclus by ly in
bed he rememb that he had often felt a slight pain in bed perhap
caus by ly awkwardli but that had alwai turn out to be pure
imagin and he wonder how hi imagin would slowli resolv
themselv todai he did not have the slightest doubt that the chang
in hi voic wa noth more than the first sign of a seriou cold
which wa an occup hazard for travel salesmen
it wa a simpl matter to throw off the cover he onli had to blow
himself up a littl and thei fell off by themselv but it becam
difficult after that especi as he wa so exception broad he
would have us hi arm and hi hand to push himself up but instead
of them he onli had all those littl leg continu move in
differ direct and which he wa moreov unabl to control if
he want to bend on of them then that wa the first on that would
stretch itself out and if he final manag to do what he want with
that leg all the other seem to be set free and would move about
painfulli thi is someth that cant be done in bed gregor said
to himself so dont keep try to do it
the first thing he want to do wa get the lower part of hi bodi out
of the bed but he had never seen thi lower part and could not
imagin what it look like it turn out to be too hard to move it
went so slowli and final almost in a frenzi when he carelessli
shove himself forward with all the forc he could gather he chose
the wrong direct hit hard against the lower bedpost and learn
from the burn pain he felt that the lower part of hi bodi might
well at present be the most sensit
so then he tri to get the top part of hi bodi out of the bed first
carefulli turn hi head to the side thi he manag quit easili
and despit it breadth and it weight the bulk of hi bodi eventu
follow slowli in the direct of the head but when he had at last
got hi head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occur to him
that if he let himself fall it would be a miracl if hi head were not
injur so he becam afraid to carri on push himself forward the
same wai and he could not knock himself out now at ani price better
to stai in bed than lose conscious
it took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier
but when he lai there sigh and wa onc more watch hi leg as
thei struggl against each other even harder than befor if that wa
possibl he could think of no wai of bring peac and order to thi
chao he told himself onc more that it wa not possibl for him to
stai in bed and that the most sensibl thing to do would be to get free
of it in whatev wai he could at whatev sacrific at the same time
though he did not forget to remind himself that calm consider wa
much better than rush to desper conclus at time like thi
he would direct hi ey to the window and look out as clearli as he
could but unfortun even the other side of the narrow street wa
envelop in morn fog and the view had littl confid or cheer to
offer him seven oclock alreadi he said to himself when the clock
struck again seven oclock and there still a fog like thi and
he lai there quietli a while longer breath lightli as if he perhap
expect the total still to bring thing back to their real and
natur state
but then he said to himself befor it strike quarter past seven ill
definit have to have got properli out of bed and by then somebodi
will have come round from work to ask what happen to me as well as
thei open up at work befor seven oclock and so he set himself to
the task of swing the entir length of hi bodi out of the bed all
at the same time if he succeed in fall out of bed in thi wai and
kept hi head rais as he did so he could probabl avoid injur it
hi back seem to be quit hard and probabl noth would happen to
it fall onto the carpet hi main concern wa for the loud nois he
wa bound to make and which even through all the door would probabl
rais concern if not alarm but it wa someth that had to be risk
when gregor wa alreadi stick half wai out of the bedth new method
wa more of a game than an effort all he had to do wa rock back and
forthit occur to him how simpl everyth would be if somebodi
came to help him two strong peopleh had hi father and the maid in
mindwould have been more than enough thei would onli have to push
their arm under the dome of hi back peel him awai from the bed bend
down with the load and then be patient and care as he swang over
onto the floor where hopefulli the littl leg would find a us
should he realli call for help though even apart from the fact that
all the door were lock despit all the difficulti he wa in he
could not suppress a smile at thi thought
after a while he had alreadi move so far across that it would have
been hard for him to keep hi balanc if he rock too hard the time
wa now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decis veri
soon then there wa a ring at the door of the flat thatll be
someon from work he said to himself and froze veri still although
hi littl leg onli becam all the more live as thei danc around
for a moment everyth remain quiet theyr not open the door
gregor said to himself caught in some nonsens hope but then of
cours the maid firm step went to the door as ever and open it
gregor onli need to hear the visitor first word of greet and he
knew who it wasth chief clerk himself why did gregor have to be the
onli on condemn to work for a compani where thei immedi becam
highli suspici at the slightest shortcom were all employe
everi on of them lout wa there not on of them who wa faith
and devot who would go so mad with pang of conscienc that he
couldnt get out of bed if he didnt spend at least a coupl of hour
in the morn on compani busi wa it realli not enough to let on
of the traine make enquiriesassum enquiri were even
necessarydid the chief clerk have to come himself and did thei have
to show the whole innoc famili that thi wa so suspici that
onli the chief clerk could be trust to have the wisdom to investig
it and more becaus these thought had made him upset than through ani
proper decis he swang himself with all hi forc out of the bed
there wa a loud thump but it wasnt realli a loud nois hi fall wa
soften a littl by the carpet and gregor back wa also more
elast than he had thought which made the sound muffl and not too
notic he had not held hi head carefulli enough though and hit
it as he fell annoi and in pain he turn it and rub it against
the carpet
someth fallen down in there said the chief clerk in the room on
the left gregor tri to imagin whether someth of the sort that
had happen to him todai could ever happen to the chief clerk too you
had to conced that it wa possibl but as if in gruff repli to thi
question the chief clerk firm footstep in hi highli polish boot
could now be heard in the adjoin room from the room on hi right
gregor sister whisper to him to let him know gregor the chief
clerk is here ye i know said gregor to himself but without
dare to rais hi voic loud enough for hi sister to hear him
gregor said hi father now from the room to hi left the chief
clerk ha come round and want to know why you didnt leav on the
earli train we dont know what to sai to him and anywai he want to
speak to you person so pleas open up thi door im sure hell be
good enough to forgiv the untidi of your room then the chief
clerk call good morn mr samsa he isnt well said hi
mother to the chief clerk while hi father continu to speak through
the door he isnt well pleas believ me why els would gregor have
miss a train the lad onli ever think about the busi it nearli
make me cross the wai he never goe out in the even he been in
town for a week now but stai home everi even he sit with us in
the kitchen and just read the paper or studi train timet hi
idea of relax is work with hi fretsaw he made a littl
frame for instanc it onli took him two or three even youll be
amaz how nice it is it hang up in hi room youll see it as
soon as gregor open the door anywai im glad your here we
wouldnt have been abl to get gregor to open the door by ourselv
he so stubborn and im sure he isnt well he said thi morn that
he is but he isnt ill be there in a moment said gregor slowli
and thoughtfulli but without move so that he would not miss ani word
of the convers well i cant think of ani other wai of explain
it mr samsa said the chief clerk i hope it noth seriou
but on the other hand i must sai that if we peopl in commerc ever
becom slightli unwel then fortun or unfortun as you like
we simpli have to overcom it becaus of busi consider can
the chief clerk come in to see you now then ask hi father
impati knock at the door again no said gregor in the room
on hi right there follow a pain silenc in the room on hi left
hi sister began to cry
so why did hi sister not go and join the other she had probabl onli
just got up and had not even begun to get dress and why wa she
cry wa it becaus he had not got up and had not let the chief
clerk in becaus he wa in danger of lose hi job and if that
happen hi boss would onc more pursu their parent with the same
demand as befor there wa no need to worri about thing like that
yet gregor wa still there and had not the slightest intent of
abandon hi famili for the time be he just lai there on the
carpet and noon who knew the condit he wa in would serious
have expect him to let the chief clerk in it wa onli a minor
discourtesi and a suitabl excus could easili be found for it later
on it wa not someth for which gregor could be sack on the spot
and it seem to gregor much more sensibl to leav him now in peac
instead of disturb him with talk at him and cry but the
other didnt know what wa happen thei were worri that would
excus their behaviour
the chief clerk now rais hi voic mr samsa he call to him

and while gregor gush out these word hardli know what he wa
sai he made hi wai over to the chest of drawersthi wa easili
done probabl becaus of the practis he had alreadi had in bedwher
he now tri to get himself upright he realli did want to open the
door realli did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief
clerk the other were be so insist and he wa curiou to learn
what thei would sai when thei caught sight of him if thei were shock
then it would no longer be gregor respons and he could rest
if howev thei took everyth calmli he would still have no reason
to be upset and if he hurri he realli could be at the station for
eight oclock the first few time he tri to climb up on the smooth
chest of drawer he just slid down again but he final gave himself
on last swing and stood there upright the lower part of hi bodi wa
in seriou pain but he no longer gave ani attent to it now he let
himself fall against the back of a nearbi chair and held tightli to the
edg of it with hi littl leg by now he had also calm down and
kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk wa sai
did you understand a word of all that the chief clerk ask hi
parent sure he not try to make fool of us oh god
call hi mother who wa alreadi in tear he could be serious ill
and were make him suffer grete grete she then cri mother
hi sister call from the other side thei commun across
gregor room youll have to go for the doctor straight awai gregor
is ill quick get the doctor did you hear the wai gregor spoke just
now that wa the voic of an anim said the chief clerk with a
calm that wa in contrast with hi mother scream anna anna
hi father call into the kitchen through the entranc hall clap
hi hand get a locksmith here now and the two girl their skirt
swish immedi ran out through the hall wrench open the
front door of the flat as thei went how had hi sister manag to get
dress so quickli there wa no sound of the door bang shut again
thei must have left it open peopl often do in home where someth
aw ha happen
gregor in contrast had becom much calmer so thei couldnt
understand hi word ani more although thei seem clear enough to
him clearer than beforeperhap hi ear had becom us to the sound
thei had realis though that there wa someth wrong with him and
were readi to help the first respons to hi situat had been
confid and wise and that made him feel better he felt that he had
been drawn back in among peopl and from the doctor and the locksmith
he expect great and surpris achievementsalthough he did not
realli distinguish on from the other whatev wa said next would be
crucial so in order to make hi voic as clear as possibl he
cough a littl but take care to do thi not too loudli as even
thi might well sound differ from the wai that a human cough and he
wa no longer sure he could judg thi for himself meanwhil it had
becom veri quiet in the next room perhap hi parent were sat at the
tabl whisper with the chief clerk or perhap thei were all press
against the door and listen
gregor slowli push hi wai over to the door with the chair onc
there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door hold himself
upright against it us the adhes on the tip of hi leg he
rest there a littl while to recov from the effort involv and
then set himself to the task of turn the kei in the lock with hi
mouth he seem unfortun to have no proper teethhow wa he
then to grasp the keybut the lack of teeth wa of cours made up
for with a veri strong jaw us the jaw he realli wa abl to start
the kei turn ignor the fact that he must have been caus some
kind of damag as a brown fluid came from hi mouth flow over the
kei and drip onto the floor listen said the chief clerk in the
next room he turn the kei gregor wa greatli encourag by
thi but thei all should have been call to him hi father and hi
mother too well done gregor thei should have cri keep at it
keep hold of the lock and with the idea that thei were all excitedli
follow hi effort he bit on the kei with all hi strength pai
no attent to the pain he wa caus himself as the kei turn
round he turn around the lock with it onli hold himself upright
with hi mouth and hung onto the kei or push it down again with the
whole weight of hi bodi as need the clear sound of the lock as it
snap back wa gregor sign that he could break hi concentr
and as he regain hi breath he said to himself so i didnt need
the locksmith after all then he lai hi head on the handl of the
door to open it complet
becaus he had to open the door in thi wai it wa alreadi wide open
befor he could be seen he had first to slowli turn himself around on
of the doubl door and he had to do it veri carefulli if he did not
want to fall flat on hi back befor enter the room he wa still
occupi with thi difficult movement unabl to pai attent to
anyth els when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud oh
which sound like the sough of the wind now he also saw himh wa
the nearest to the doorhi hand press against hi open mouth and
slowli retreat as if driven by a steadi and invis forc
gregor mother her hair still dishevel from bed despit the chief
clerk be there look at hi father then she unfold her arm
took two step forward toward gregor and sank down onto the floor into
her skirt that spread themselv out around her as her head
disappear down onto her breast hi father look hostil and
clench hi fist as if want to knock gregor back into hi room
then he look uncertainli round the live room cover hi ey with
hi hand and wept so that hi power chest shook
so gregor did not go into the room but leant against the insid of the
other door which wa still held bolt in place in thi wai onli half
of hi bodi could be seen along with hi head abov it which he leant
over to on side as he peer out at the other meanwhil the dai had
becom much lighter part of the endless greyblack build on the
other side of the streetwhich wa a hospitalcould be seen quit
clearli with the auster and regular line of window pierc it
faad the rain wa still fall now throw down larg individu
droplet which hit the ground on at a time the wash up from
breakfast lai on the tabl there wa so much of it becaus for
gregor father breakfast wa the most import meal of the dai and
he would stretch it out for sever hour as he sat read a number of
differ newspap on the wall exactli opposit there wa photograph
of gregor when he wa a lieuten in the armi hi sword in hi hand
and a carefre smile on hi face as he call forth respect for hi
uniform and bear the door to the entranc hall wa open and as the
front door of the flat wa also open he could see onto the land and
the stair where thei began their wai down below
now then said gregor well awar that he wa the onli on to have
kept calm ill get dress straight awai now pack up my sampl and
set off will you pleas just let me leav you can see he said to
the chief clerk that im not stubborn and i like to do my job be
a commerci travel is arduou but without travel i couldnt
earn my live so where ar you go in to the offic ye will you
report everyth accur then it quit possibl for someon to
be temporarili unabl to work but that just the right time to
rememb what been achiev in the past and consid that later on
onc the difficulti ha been remov he will certainli work with all
the more dilig and concentr your well awar that im
serious in debt to our employ as well as have to look after my
parent and my sister so that im trap in a difficult situat
but i will work my wai out of it again pleas dont make thing ani
harder for me than thei ar alreadi and dont take side against me at
the offic i know that nobodi like the travel thei think we earn
an enorm wage as well as have a soft time of it that just
prejudic but thei have no particular reason to think better of it but
you sir you have a better overview than the rest of the staff in
fact if i can sai thi in confid a better overview than the boss
himselfit veri easi for a businessman like him to make mistak
about hi employe and judg them more harshli than he should and
your also well awar that we travel spend almost the whole year
awai from the offic so that we can veri easili fall victim to gossip
and chanc and groundless complaint and it almost imposs to
defend yourself from that sort of thing we dont usual even hear
about them or if at all it when we arriv back home exhaust from a
trip and that when we feel the harm effect of what been go
on without even know what caus them pleas dont go awai at
least first sai someth to show that you grant that im at least
partli right
but the chief clerk had turn awai as soon as gregor had start to
speak and with protrud lip onli stare back at him over hi
trembl shoulder as he left he did not keep still for a moment
while gregor wa speak but move steadili toward the door without
take hi ey off him he move veri gradual as if there had been
some secret prohibit on leav the room it wa onli when he had
reach the entranc hall that he made a sudden movement drew hi foot
from the live room and rush forward in a panic in the hall he
stretch hi right hand far out toward the stairwai as if out there
there were some supernatur forc wait to save him
gregor realis that it wa out of the question to let the chief clerk
go awai in thi mood if hi posit in the firm wa not to be put into
extrem danger that wa someth hi parent did not understand veri
well over the year thei had becom convinc that thi job would
provid for gregor for hi entir life and besid thei had so much
to worri about at present that thei had lost sight of ani thought for
the futur gregor though did think about the futur the chief clerk
had to be held back calm down convinc and final won over the
futur of gregor and hi famili depend on it if onli hi sister were
here she wa clever she wa alreadi in tear while gregor wa still
ly peacefulli on hi back and the chief clerk wa a lover of women
sure she could persuad him she would close the front door in the
entranc hall and talk him out of hi shock state but hi sister wa
not there gregor would have to do the job himself and without
consid that he still wa not familiar with how well he could move
about in hi present state or that hi speech still might notor
probabl would notb understood he let go of the door push himself
through the open tri to reach the chief clerk on the land who
ridicul wa hold on to the banist with both hand but
gregor fell immedi over and with a littl scream as he sought
someth to hold onto land on hi numer littl leg hardli had
that happen than for the first time that dai he began to feel
alright with hi bodi the littl leg had the solid ground under them
to hi pleasur thei did exactli as he told them thei were even
make the effort to carri him where he want to go and he wa soon
believ that all hi sorrow would soon be final at an end he held
back the urg to move but swai from side to side as he crouch there
on the floor hi mother wa not far awai in front of him and seem
at first quit engross in herself but then she suddenli jump up
with her arm outstretch and her finger spread shout help for
piti sake help the wai she held her head suggest she want to
see gregor better but the unthink wai she wa hurri backward
show that she did not she had forgotten that the tabl wa behind
her with all the breakfast thing on it when she reach the tabl she
sat quickli down on it without know what she wa do without even
seem to notic that the coffe pot had been knock over and a gush
of coffe wa pour down onto the carpet
mother mother said gregor gentli look up at her he had
complet forgotten the chief clerk for the moment but could not help
himself snap in the air with hi jaw at the sight of the flow of
coffe that set hi mother scream anew she fled from the tabl and
into the arm of hi father as he rush toward her gregor though
had no time to spare for hi parent now the chief clerk had alreadi
reach the stair with hi chin on the banist he look back for
the last time gregor made a run for him he want to be sure of
reach him the chief clerk must have expect someth as he leapt
down sever step at onc and disappear hi shout resound all
around the staircas the flight of the chief clerk seem
unfortun to put gregor father into a panic as well until then
he had been rel self control but now instead of run
after the chief clerk himself or at least not imped gregor as he
ran after him gregor father seiz the chief clerk stick in hi
right hand the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair along with
hi hat and overcoat pick up a larg newspap from the tabl with
hi left and us them to drive gregor back into hi room stamp
hi foot at him as he went gregor appeal to hi father were of no
help hi appeal were simpli not understood howev much he humbl
turn hi head hi father mere stamp hi foot all the harder
across the room despit the chilli weather gregor mother had pull
open a window leant far out of it and press her hand to her face a
strong draught of air flew in from the street toward the stairwai the
curtain flew up the newspap on the tabl flutter and some of
them were blown onto the floor noth would stop gregor father as
he drove him back make hiss nois at him like a wild man gregor
had never had ani practic in move backward and wa onli abl to go
veri slowli if gregor had onli been allow to turn round he would
have been back in hi room straight awai but he wa afraid that if he
took the time to do that hi father would becom impati and there
wa the threat of a lethal blow to hi back or head from the stick in
hi father hand ani moment eventu though gregor realis that
he had no choic as he saw to hi disgust that he wa quit incap
of go backward in a straight line so he began as quickli as
possibl and with frequent anxiou glanc at hi father to turn
himself round it went veri slowli but perhap hi father wa abl to
see hi good intent as he did noth to hinder him in fact now
and then he us the tip of hi stick to give direct from a
distanc as to which wai to turn if onli hi father would stop that
unbear hiss it wa make gregor quit confus when he had
nearli finish turn round still listen to that hiss he made
a mistak and turn himself back a littl the wai he had just come he
wa pleas when he final had hi head in front of the doorwai but
then saw that it wa too narrow and hi bodi wa too broad to get
through it without further difficulti in hi present mood it
obvious did not occur to hi father to open the other of the doubl
door so that gregor would have enough space to get through he wa
mere fix on the idea that gregor should be got back into hi room
as quickli as possibl nor would he ever have allow gregor the time
to get himself upright as prepar for get through the doorwai
what he did make more nois than ever wa to drive gregor forward
all the harder as if there had been noth in the wai it sound to
gregor as if there wa now more than on father behind him it wa not
a pleasant experi and gregor push himself into the doorwai
without regard for what might happen on side of hi bodi lift
itself he lai at an angl in the doorwai on flank scrape on the
white door and wa painfulli injur leav vile brown fleck on it
soon he wa stuck fast and would not have been abl to move at all by
himself the littl leg along on side hung quiver in the air while
those on the other side were press painfulli against the ground then
hi father gave him a hefti shove from behind which releas him from
where he wa held and sent him fly and heavili bleed deep into
hi room the door wa slam shut with the stick then final all
wa quiet
ii
it wa not until it wa get dark that even that gregor awok
from hi deep and comalik sleep he would have woken soon afterward
anywai even if he hadnt been disturb as he had had enough sleep and
felt fulli rest but he had the impress that some hurri step
and the sound of the door lead into the front room be carefulli
shut had woken him the light from the electr street lamp shone
pale here and there onto the ceil and top of the furnitur but
down below where gregor wa it wa dark he push himself over to
the door feel hi wai clumsili with hi antennaeof which he wa
now begin to learn the valuein order to see what had been
happen there the whole of hi left side seem like on painfulli
stretch scar and he limp badli on hi two row of leg on of the
leg had been badli injur in the event of that morningit wa nearli
a miracl that onli on of them had beenand drag along lifelessli
it wa onli when he had reach the door that he realis what it
actual wa that had drawn him over to it it wa the smell of
someth to eat by the door there wa a dish fill with sweeten
milk with littl piec of white bread float in it he wa so
pleas he almost laugh as he wa even hungrier than he had been
that morn and immedi dip hi head into the milk nearli
cover hi ey with it but he soon drew hi head back again in
disappoint not onli did the pain in hi tender left side make it
difficult to eat the foodh wa onli abl to eat if hi whole bodi
work togeth as a snuffl wholebut the milk did not tast at all
nice milk like thi wa normal hi favourit drink and hi sister
had certainli left it there for him becaus of that but he turn
almost against hi own will awai from the dish and crawl back into
the centr of the room
through the crack in the door gregor could see that the ga had been
lit in the live room hi father at thi time would normal be sat
with hi even paper read it out in a loud voic to gregor
mother and sometim to hi sister but there wa now not a sound to
be heard gregor sister would often write and tell him about thi
read but mayb hi father had lost the habit in recent time it
wa so quiet all around too even though there must have been somebodi
in the flat what a quiet life it is the famili lead said gregor to
himself and gaze into the dark felt a great pride that he wa
abl to provid a life like that in such a nice home for hi sister and
parent but what now if all thi peac and wealth and comfort should
come to a horribl and frighten end that wa someth that gregor
did not want to think about too much so he start to move about
crawl up and down the room
onc dure that long even the door on on side of the room wa
open veri slightli and hurriedli close again later on the door on
the other side did the same it seem that someon need to enter the
room but thought better of it gregor went and wait immedi by
the door resolv either to bring the timor visitor into the room
in some wai or at least to find out who it wa but the door wa open
no more that night and gregor wait in vain the previou morn
while the door were lock everyon had want to get in there to him
but now now that he had open up on of the door and the other had
clearli been unlock some time dure the dai noon came and the
kei were in the other side
it wa not until late at night that the gaslight in the live room wa
put out and now it wa easi to see that hi parent and sister had
stai awak all that time as thei all could be distinctli heard as
thei went awai togeth on tipto it wa clear that noon would come
into gregor room ani more until morn that gave him plenti of time
to think undisturb about how he would have to rearrang hi life
for some reason the tall empti room where he wa forc to remain
made him feel uneasi as he lai there flat on the floor even though he
had been live in it for five year hardli awar of what he wa do
other than a slight feel of shame he hurri under the couch it
press down on hi back a littl and he wa no longer abl to lift
hi head but he nonetheless felt immedi at eas and hi onli
regret wa that hi bodi wa too broad to get it all underneath
he spent the whole night there some of the time he pass in a light
sleep although he frequent woke from it in alarm becaus of hi
hunger and some of the time wa spent in worri and vagu hope
which howev alwai led to the same conclus for the time be
he must remain calm he must show patienc and the greatest
consider so that hi famili could bear the unpleas that he
in hi present condit wa forc to impos on them
gregor soon had the opportun to test the strength of hi decis
as earli the next morn almost befor the night had end hi
sister nearli fulli dress open the door from the front room and
look anxious in she did not see him straight awai but when she
did notic him under the couchh had to be somewher for god sake
he couldnt have flown awaysh wa so shock that she lost control of
herself and slam the door shut again from outsid but she seem to
regret her behaviour as she open the door again straight awai and
came in on tipto as if enter the room of someon serious ill or
even of a stranger gregor had push hi head forward right to the
edg of the couch and watch her would she notic that he had left
the milk as it wa realis that it wa not from ani lack of hunger and
bring him in some other food that wa more suitabl if she didnt do
it herself he would rather go hungri than draw her attent to it
although he did feel a terribl urg to rush forward from under the
couch throw himself at hi sister feet and beg her for someth
good to eat howev hi sister notic the full dish immedi and
look at it and the few drop of milk splash around it with some
surpris she immedi pick it upus a rag not her bare
handsand carri it out gregor wa extrem curiou as to what she
would bring in it place imagin the wildest possibl but he
never could have guess what hi sister in her good actual did
bring in order to test hi tast she brought him a whole select of
thing all spread out on an old newspap there were old halfrotten
veget bone from the even meal cover in white sauc that
had gone hard a few raisin and almond some chees that gregor had
declar ined two dai befor a dry roll and some bread spread
with butter and salt as well as all that she had pour some water
into the dish which had probabl been perman set asid for
gregor us and place it besid them then out of consider for
gregor feel as she knew that he would not eat in front of her
she hurri out again and even turn the kei in the lock so that
gregor would know he could make thing as comfort for himself as he
like gregor littl leg whir at last he could eat what more
hi injuri must alreadi have complet heal as he found no
difficulti in move thi amaz him as more than a month earlier he
had cut hi finger slightli with a knife he thought of how hi finger
had still hurt the dai befor yesterdai am i less sensit than i
us to be then he thought and wa alreadi suck greedili at the
chees which had immedi almost compellingli attract him much
more than the other food on the newspap quickli on after anoth
hi ey water with pleasur he consum the chees the veget
and the sauc the fresh food on the other hand he didnt like at
all and even drag the thing he did want to eat a littl wai awai
from them becaus he couldnt stand the smell long after he had
finish eat and lai letharg in the same place hi sister slowli
turn the kei in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw he
wa immedi startl although he had been half asleep and he
hurri back under the couch but he need great selfcontrol to stai
there even for the short time that hi sister wa in the room as
eat so much food had round out hi bodi a littl and he could
hardli breath in that narrow space half suffoc he watch with
bulg ey as hi sister unselfconsci took a broom and swept up
the leftov mix them in with the food he had not even touch at
all as if it could not be us ani more she quickli drop it all
into a bin close it with it wooden lid and carri everyth out
she had hardli turn her back befor gregor came out again from under
the couch and stretch himself
thi wa how gregor receiv hi food each dai now onc in the morn
while hi parent and the maid were still asleep and the second time
after everyon had eaten their meal at middai as hi parent would
sleep for a littl while then as well and gregor sister would send
the maid awai on some errand gregor father and mother certainli did
not want him to starv either but perhap it would have been more than
thei could stand to have ani more experi of hi feed than be
told about it and perhap hi sister want to spare them what
distress she could as thei were inde suffer enough
it wa imposs for gregor to find out what thei had told the doctor
and the locksmith that first morn to get them out of the flat as
nobodi could understand him nobodi not even hi sister thought that
he could understand them so he had to be content to hear hi sister
sigh and appeal to the saint as she move about hi room it wa
onli later when she had becom a littl more us to everythingther
wa of cours no question of her ever becom fulli us to the
situationthat gregor would sometim catch a friendli comment or at
least a comment that could be constru as friendli he enjoi hi
dinner todai she might sai when he had dilig clear awai all
the food left for him or if he left most of it which slowli becam
more and more frequent she would often sai sadli now everyth
just been left there again
although gregor wasnt abl to hear ani new directli he did listen to
much of what wa said in the next room and whenev he heard anyon
speak he would scurri straight to the appropri door and press hi
whole bodi against it there wa seldom ani convers especi at
first that wa not about him in some wai even if onli in secret for
two whole dai all the talk at everi mealtim wa about what thei
should do now but even between meal thei spoke about the same subject
as there were alwai at least two member of the famili at homenobodi
want to be at home by themselv and it wa out of the question to
leav the flat entir empti and on the veri first dai the maid had
fallen to her knee and beg gregor mother to let her go without
delai it wa not veri clear how much she knew of what had happen but
she left within a quarter of an hour tearfulli thank gregor
mother for her dismiss as if she had done her an enorm servic
she even swore emphat not to tell anyon the slightest about what
had happen even though noon had ask that of her
now gregor sister also had to help hi mother with the cook
although that wa not so much bother as noon at veri much gregor
often heard how on of them would unsuccessfulli urg anoth to eat
and receiv no more answer than no thank iv had enough or
someth similar noon drank veri much either hi sister would
sometim ask hi father whether he would like a beer hope for the
chanc to go and fetch it herself when hi father then said noth
she would add so that he would not feel selfish that she could send
the housekeep for it but then hi father would close the matter with
a big loud no and no more would be said
even befor the first dai had come to an end hi father had explain
to gregor mother and sister what their financ and prospect were
now and then he stood up from the tabl and took some receipt or
document from the littl cash box he had save from hi busi when
it had collaps five year earlier gregor heard how he open the
complic lock and then close it again after he had taken the item
he want what he heard hi father sai wa some of the first good new
that gregor heard sinc he had first been incarcer in hi room he
had thought that noth at all remain from hi father busi at
least he had never told him anyth differ and gregor had never
ask him about it anywai their busi misfortun had reduc the
famili to a state of total despair and gregor onli concern at that
time had been to arrang thing so that thei could all forget about it
as quickli as possibl so then he start work especi hard
with a fieri vigour that rais him from a junior salesman to a
travel repres almost overnight bring with it the chanc
to earn monei in quit differ wai gregor convert hi success at
work straight into cash that he could lai on the tabl at home for the
benefit of hi astonish and delight famili thei had been good
time and thei had never come again at least not with the same
splendour even though gregor had later earn so much that he wa in a
posit to bear the cost of the whole famili and did bear them thei
had even got us to it both gregor and the famili thei took the
monei with gratitud and he wa glad to provid it although there wa
no longer much warm affect given in return gregor onli remain
close to hi sister now unlik him she wa veri fond of music and a
gift and express violinist it wa hi secret plan to send her to
the conservatori next year even though it would caus great expens
that would have to be made up for in some other wai dure gregor
short period in town convers with hi sister would often turn to
the conservatori but it wa onli ever mention as a love dream that
could never be realis their parent did not like to hear thi
innoc talk but gregor thought about it quit hard and decid he
would let them know what he plan with a grand announc of it on
christma dai
that wa the sort of total pointless thing that went through hi mind
in hi present state press upright against the door and listen
there were time when he simpli becam too tire to continu listen
when hi head would fall wearili against the door and he would pull it
up again with a start as even the slightest nois he caus would be
heard next door and thei would all go silent what that he do
now hi father would sai after a while clearli have gone over to
the door and onli then would the interrupt convers slowli be
taken up again
when explain thing hi father repeat himself sever time
partli becaus it wa a long time sinc he had been occupi with these
matter himself and partli becaus gregor mother did not understand
everyth the first time from these repeat explan gregor
learn to hi pleasur that despit all their misfortun there wa
still some monei avail from the old dai it wa not a lot but it
had not been touch in the meantim and some interest had accumul
besid that thei had not been us up all the monei that gregor had
been bring home everi month keep onli a littl for himself so
that that too had been accumul behind the door gregor nod
with enthusiasm in hi pleasur at thi unexpect thrift and caution
he could actual have us thi surplu monei to reduc hi father
debt to hi boss and the dai when he could have freed himself from
that job would have come much closer but now it wa certainli better
the wai hi father had done thing
thi monei howev wa certainli not enough to enabl the famili to
live off the interest it wa enough to maintain them for perhap on
or two year no more that to sai it wa monei that should not
realli be touch but set asid for emerg monei to live on had
to be earn hi father wa healthi but old and lack in self
confid dure the five year that he had not been workingth
first holidai in a life that had been full of strain and no successh
had put on a lot of weight and becom veri slow and clumsi would
gregor elderli mother now have to go and earn monei she suffer
from asthma and it wa a strain for her just to move about the home
everi other dai would be spent struggl for breath on the sofa by the
open window would hi sister have to go and earn monei she wa still
a child of seventeen her life up till then had been veri enviabl
consist of wear nice cloth sleep late help out in the
busi join in with a few modest pleasur and most of all
plai the violin whenev thei began to talk of the need to earn
monei gregor would alwai first let go of the door and then throw
himself onto the cool leather sofa next to it as he becam quit hot
with shame and regret
he would often lie there the whole night through not sleep a wink
but scratch at the leather for hour on end or he might go to all
the effort of push a chair to the window climb up onto the sill
and prop up in the chair lean on the window to stare out of it
he had us to feel a great sens of freedom from do thi but do
it now wa obvious someth more rememb than experienc as
what he actual saw in thi wai wa becom less distinct everi dai
even thing that were quit near he had us to curs the everpres
view of the hospit across the street but now he could not see it at
all and if he had not known that he live in charlottenstrass which
wa a quiet street despit be in the middl of the citi he could
have thought that he wa look out the window at a barren wast where
the grei sky and the grei earth mingl insepar hi observ
sister onli need to notic the chair twice befor she would alwai
push it back to it exact posit by the window after she had tidi
up the room and even left the inner pane of the window open from then
on
if gregor had onli been abl to speak to hi sister and thank her for
all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to
bear it but as it wa it caus him pain hi sister natur tri
as far as possibl to pretend there wa noth burdensom about it
and the longer it went on of cours the better she wa abl to do so
but as time went by gregor wa also abl to see through it all so much
better it had even becom veri unpleas for him now whenev she
enter the room no sooner had she come in than she would quickli
close the door as a precaut so that noon would have to suffer the
view into gregor room then she would go straight to the window and
pull it hurriedli open almost as if she were suffoc even if it
wa cold she would stai at the window breath deepli for a littl
while she would alarm gregor twice a dai with thi run about and
nois make he would stai under the couch shiver the whole while
know full well that she would certainli have like to spare him thi
ordeal but it wa imposs for her to be in the same room with him
with the window close
on dai about a month after gregor transform when hi sister no
longer had ani particular reason to be shock at hi appear she
came into the room a littl earlier than usual and found him still
stare out the window motionless and just where he would be most
horribl in itself hi sister not come into the room would have
been no surpris for gregor as it would have been difficult for her to
immedi open the window while he wa still there but not onli did
she not come in she went straight back and close the door behind her
a stranger would have thought he had threaten her and tri to bite
her gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch of cours
but he had to wait until middai befor hi sister came back and she
seem much more uneasi than usual it made him realis that she still
found hi appear unbear and would continu to do so she
probabl even had to overcom the urg to flee when she saw the littl
bit of him that protrud from under the couch on dai in order to
spare her even thi sight he spent four hour carri the bedsheet
over to the couch on hi back and arrang it so that he wa complet
cover and hi sister would not be abl to see him even if she bent
down if she did not think thi sheet wa necessari then all she had to
do wa take it off again as it wa clear enough that it wa no
pleasur for gregor to cut himself off so complet she left the
sheet where it wa gregor even thought he glimps a look of gratitud
on time when he carefulli look out from under the sheet to see how
hi sister like the new arrang
for the first fourteen dai gregor parent could not bring
themselv to come into the room to see him he would often hear them
sai how thei appreci all the new work hi sister wa do even
though befor thei had seen her as a girl who wa somewhat useless
and frequent been annoi with her but now the two of them father
and mother would often both wait outsid the door of gregor room
while hi sister tidi up in there and as soon as she went out again
she would have to tell them exactli how everyth look what gregor
had eaten how he had behav thi time and whether perhap ani
slight improv could be seen hi mother also want to go in and
visit gregor rel soon but hi father and sister at first
persuad her against it gregor listen veri close to all thi and
approv fulli later though she had to be held back by forc which
made her call out let me go and see gregor he is my unfortun son
cant you understand i have to see him and gregor would think to
himself that mayb it would be better if hi mother came in not everi
dai of cours but on dai a week perhap she could understand
everyth much better than hi sister who for all her courag wa
still just a child after all and realli might not have had an adult
appreci of the burdensom job she had taken on
gregor wish to see hi mother wa soon realis out of consider
for hi parent gregor want to avoid be seen at the window dure
the dai the few squar meter of the floor did not give him much room
to crawl about it wa hard to just lie quietli through the night hi
food soon stop give him ani pleasur at all and so to entertain
himself he got into the habit of crawl up and down the wall and
ceil he wa especi fond of hang from the ceil it wa
quit differ from ly on the floor he could breath more freeli
hi bodi had a light swing to it and up there relax and almost
happi it might happen that he would surpris even himself by let
go of the ceil and land on the floor with a crash but now of
cours he had far better control of hi bodi than befor and even
with a fall as great as that caus himself no damag veri soon hi
sister notic gregor new wai of entertain himselfh had after
all left trace of the adhes from hi feet as he crawl aboutand
got it into her head to make it as easi as possibl for him by remov
the furnitur that got in hi wai especi the chest of drawer and
the desk now thi wa not someth that she would be abl to do by
herself she did not dare to ask for help from her father the sixteen
year old maid had carri on brave sinc the cook had left but she
certainli would not have help in thi she had even ask to be
allow to keep the kitchen lock at all time and never to have to
open the door unless it wa especi import so hi sister had no
choic but to choos some time when gregor father wa not there and
fetch hi mother to help her as she approach the room gregor could
hear hi mother express her joi but onc at the door she went silent
first of cours hi sister came in and look round to see that
everyth in the room wa alright and onli then did she let her
mother enter gregor had hurriedli pull the sheet down lower over the
couch and put more fold into it so that everyth realli look as if
it had just been thrown down by chanc gregor also refrain thi
time from spy out from under the sheet he gave up the chanc to
see hi mother until later and wa simpli glad that she had come you
can come in he cant be seen said hi sister obvious lead her
in by the hand the old chest of drawer wa too heavi for a pair of
feebl women to be heav about but gregor listen as thei push it
from it place hi sister alwai take on the heaviest part of the
work for herself and ignor her mother warn that she would
strain herself thi last a veri long time after labour at it for
fifteen minut or more hi mother said it would be better to leav the
chest where it wa for on thing it wa too heavi for them to get the
job finish befor gregor father got home and leav it in the
middl of the room it would be in hi wai even more and for anoth
thing it wasnt even sure that take the furnitur awai would realli
be ani help to him she thought just the opposit the sight of the
bare wall sadden her right to her heart and why wouldnt gregor
feel the same wai about it hed been us to thi furnitur in hi
room for a long time and it would make him feel abandon to be in an
empti room like that then quietli almost whisper as if want
gregor whose whereabout she did not know to hear not even the tone
of her voic as she wa convinc that he did not understand her
word she ad and by take the furnitur awai wont it seem like
were show that weve given up all hope of improv and were
abandon him to cope for himself i think itd be best to leav the
room exactli the wai it wa befor so that when gregor come back to us
again hell find everyth unchang and hell be abl to forget the
time in between all the easier
hear these word from hi mother made gregor realis that the lack
of ani direct human commun along with the monoton life led
by the famili dure these two month must have made him confusedh
could think of no other wai of explain to himself why he had
serious want hi room empti out had he realli want to
transform hi room into a cave a warm room fit out with the nice
furnitur he had inherit that would have let him crawl around
unimped in ani direct but it would also have let him quickli
forget hi past when he had still been human he had come veri close to
forget and it had onli been the voic of hi mother unheard for
so long that had shaken him out of it noth should be remov
everyth had to stai he could not do without the good influenc the
furnitur had on hi condit and if the furnitur made it difficult
for him to crawl about mindlessli that wa not a loss but a great
advantag
hi sister unfortun did not agre she had becom us to the
idea not without reason that she wa gregor spokesman to hi
parent about the thing that concern him thi meant that hi
mother advic now wa suffici reason for her to insist on remov
not onli the chest of drawer and the desk as she had thought at
first but all the furnitur apart from the allimport couch it wa
more than childish pervers of cours or the unexpect confid
she had recent acquir that made her insist she had inde notic
that gregor need a lot of room to crawl about in wherea the
furnitur as far as anyon could see wa of no us to him at all
girl of that ag though do becom enthusiast about thing and feel
thei must get their wai whenev thei can perhap thi wa what
tempt grete to make gregor situat seem even more shock than
it wa so that she could do even more for him grete would probabl be
the onli on who would dare enter a room domin by gregor crawl
about the bare wall by himself
so she refus to let her mother dissuad her gregor mother alreadi
look uneasi in hi room she soon stop speak and help
gregor sister to get the chest of drawer out with what strength she
had the chest of drawer wa someth that gregor could do without if
he had to but the write desk had to stai hardli had the two women
push the chest of drawer groan out of the room than gregor
poke hi head out from under the couch to see what he could do about
it he meant to be as care and consider as he could but
unfortun it wa hi mother who came back first while grete in the
next room had her arm round the chest push and pull at it from
side to side by herself without of cours move it an inch hi
mother wa not us to the sight of gregor he might have made her ill
so gregor hurri backward to the far end of the couch in hi
startlement though he wa not abl to prevent the sheet at it front
from move a littl it wa enough to attract hi mother attent
she stood veri still remain there a moment and then went back out
to grete
gregor kept try to assur himself that noth unusu wa
happen it wa just a few piec of furnitur be move after all
but he soon had to admit that the women go to and fro their littl
call to each other the scrape of the furnitur on the floor all
these thing made him feel as if he were be assail from all side
with hi head and leg pull in against him and hi bodi press to
the floor he wa forc to admit to himself that he could not stand
all of thi much longer thei were empti hi room out take awai
everyth that wa dear to him thei had alreadi taken out the chest
contain hi fretsaw and other tool now thei threaten to remov
the write desk with it place clearli worn into the floor the desk
where he had done hi homework as a busi traine at high school
even while he had been at infant schoolh realli could not wait ani
longer to see whether the two women intent were good he had
nearli forgotten thei were there anywai as thei were now too tire to
sai anyth while thei work and he could onli hear their feet as
thei step heavili on the floor
so while the women were leant against the desk in the other room

and oppress with anxieti and selfreproach he began to crawl about
he crawl over everyth wall furnitur ceil and final in
hi confus as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down
into the middl of the dinner tabl
he lai there for a while numb and immobil all around him it wa
quiet mayb that wa a good sign then there wa someon at the door
the maid of cours had lock herself in her kitchen so that grete
would have to go and answer it hi father had arriv home what

everyth clear to him she answer him with subdu voic and
openli press her face into hi chest mother faint but she
better now gregor got out just as i expect said hi father
just as i alwai said but you women wouldnt listen would you it
wa clear to gregor that grete had not said enough and that hi father
took it to mean that someth bad had happen that he wa
respons for some act of violenc that meant gregor would now have
to try to calm hi father as he did not have the time to explain
thing to him even if that had been possibl so he fled to the door of
hi room and press himself against it so that hi father when he
came in from the hall could see straight awai that gregor had the best
intent and would go back into hi room without delai that it would
not be necessari to drive him back but that thei had onli to open the
door and he would disappear
hi father though wa not in the mood to notic subtleti like that
ah he shout as he came in sound as if he were both angri and
glad at the same time gregor drew hi head back from the door and
lift it toward hi father he realli had not imagin hi father the
wai he stood there now of late with hi new habit of crawl about
he had neglect to pai attent to what wa go on the rest of the
flat the wai he had done befor he realli ought to have expect

the same tire man as us to be lai there entomb in hi bed when
gregor came back from hi busi trip who would receiv him sit
in the armchair in hi nightgown when he came back in the even who
wa hardli even abl to stand up but as a sign of hi pleasur would
just rais hi arm and who on the coupl of time a year when thei
went for a walk togeth on a sundai or public holidai wrap up
tightli in hi overcoat between gregor and hi mother would alwai
labour hi wai forward a littl more slowli than them who were alreadi
walk slowli for hi sake who would place hi stick down carefulli
and if he want to sai someth would invari stop and gather hi
companion around him he wa stand up straight enough now dress
in a smart blue uniform with gold button the sort worn by the
employe at the bank institut abov the high stiff collar of the
coat hi strong doublechin emerg under the bushi eyebrow hi

an arc right across the room onto the sofa put hi hand in hi
trouser pocket push back the bottom of hi long uniform coat and
with look of determin walk toward gregor he probabl did not
even know himself what he had in mind but nonetheless lift hi feet
unusu high gregor wa amaz at the enorm size of the sole of

the first dai of hi new life that hi father thought it necessari to
alwai be extrem strict with him and so he ran up to hi father
stop when hi father stop scurri forward again when he move
even slightli in thi wai thei went round the room sever time
without anyth decis happen without even give the impress
of a chase as everyth went so slowli gregor remain all thi time
on the floor larg becaus he fear hi father might see it as
especi provok if he fled onto the wall or ceil whatev he
did gregor had to admit that he certainli would not be abl to keep up
thi run about for long as for each step hi father took he had to
carri out countless movement he becam notic short of breath
even in hi earlier life hi lung had not been veri reliabl now as
he lurch about in hi effort to muster all the strength he could for
run he could hardli keep hi ey open hi thought becam too
slow for him to think of ani other wai of save himself than run
he almost forgot that the wall were there for him to us although
here thei were conceal behind carefulli carv furnitur full of
notch and protrusionsthen right besid him lightli toss
someth flew down and roll in front of him it wa an appl then
anoth on immedi flew at him gregor froze in shock there wa
no longer ani point in run as hi father had decid to bombard
him he had fill hi pocket with fruit from the bowl on the
sideboard and now without even take the time for care aim threw

iii
noon dare to remov the appl lodg in gregor flesh so it
remain there as a visibl remind of hi injuri he had suffer it
there for more than a month and hi condit seem seriou enough to
remind even hi father that gregor despit hi current sad and
revolt form wa a famili member who could not be treat as an
enemi on the contrari as a famili there wa a duti to swallow ani
revuls for him and to be patient just to be patient
becaus of hi injuri gregor had lost much of hi mobilityprob
perman he had been reduc to the condit of an ancient invalid
and it took him long long minut to crawl across hi roomcrawl
over the ceil wa out of the questionbut thi deterior in hi
condit wa fulli in hi opinion made up for by the door to the
live room be left open everi even he got into the habit of
close watch it for on or two hour befor it wa open and then
ly in the dark of hi room where he could not be seen from the
live room he could watch the famili in the light of the dinner tabl
and listen to their conversationwith everyon permiss in a wai
and thu quit differ from befor
thei no longer held the live convers of earlier time of
cours the on that gregor alwai thought about with long when he
wa tire and get into the damp bed in some small hotel room all
of them were usual veri quiet nowadai soon after dinner hi father
would go to sleep in hi chair hi mother and sister would urg each
other to be quiet hi mother bent deepli under the lamp would sew
fanci underwear for a fashion shop hi sister who had taken a sale
job learn shorthand and french in the even so that she might be
abl to get a better posit later on sometim hi father would wake
up and sai to gregor mother your do so much sew again
todai as if he did not know that he had been dozingand then he
would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchang a
tire grin
with a kind of stubborn gregor father refus to take hi
uniform off even at home while hi nightgown hung unus on it peg
gregor father would slumber where he wa fulli dress as if alwai
readi to serv and expect to hear the voic of hi superior even
here the uniform had not been new to start with but as a result of
thi it slowli becam even shabbier despit the effort of gregor
mother and sister to look after it gregor would often spend the whole
even look at all the stain on thi coat with it gold button
alwai kept polish and shini while the old man in it would sleep
highli uncomfort but peac
as soon as it struck ten gregor mother would speak gentli to hi
father to wake him and try to persuad him to go to bed as he couldnt
sleep properli where he wa and he realli had to get hi sleep if he
wa to be up at six to get to work but sinc he had been in work he
had becom more obstin and would alwai insist on stai longer at
the tabl even though he regularli fell asleep and it wa then harder
than ever to persuad him to exchang the chair for hi bed then
howev much mother and sister would importun him with littl
reproach and warn he would keep slowli shake hi head for a
quarter of an hour with hi ey close and refus to get up
gregor mother would tug at hi sleev whisper endear into hi
ear gregor sister would leav her work to help her mother but
noth would have ani effect on him he would just sink deeper into
hi chair onli when the two women took him under the arm he would
abruptli open hi ey look at them on after the other and sai what
a life thi is what peac i get in my old ag and support by the
two women he would lift himself up carefulli as if he were carri the
greatest load himself let the women take him to the door send them
off and carri on by himself while gregor mother would throw down her
needl and hi sister her pen so that thei could run after hi father
and continu be of help to him
who in thi tire and overwork famili would have had time to give
more attent to gregor than wa absolut necessari the household
budget becam even smaller so now the maid wa dismiss an enorm
thickbon charwoman with white hair that flap around her head came
everi morn and even to do the heaviest work everyth els wa
look after by gregor mother on top of the larg amount of sew
work she did gregor even learn listen to the even
convers about what price thei had hope for that sever item of
jewelleri belong to the famili had been sold even though both
mother and sister had been veri fond of wear them at function and
celebr but the loudest complaint wa that although the flat wa
much too big for their present circumst thei could not move out
of it there wa no imagin wai of transfer gregor to the new
address he could see quit well though that there were more reason
than consider for him that made it difficult for them to move it
would have been quit easi to transport him in ani suitabl crate with
a few air hole in it the main thing hold the famili back from
their decis to move wa much more to do with their total despair
and the thought that thei had been struck with a misfortun unlik
anyth experienc by anyon els thei knew or were relat to thei
carri out absolut everyth that the world expect from poor
peopl gregor father brought bank employe their breakfast hi
mother sacrif herself by wash cloth for stranger hi sister
ran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the custom but
thei just did not have the strength to do ani more and the injuri in
gregor back began to hurt as much as when it wa new after thei had
come back from take hi father to bed gregor mother and sister
would now leav their work where it wa and sit close togeth cheek
to cheek hi mother would point to gregor room and sai close that
door grete and then when he wa in the dark again thei would sit
in the next room and their tear would mingl or thei would simpli sit
there stare dryei at the tabl
gregor hardli slept at all either night or dai sometim he would
think of take over the famili affair just like befor the next
time the door wa open he had long forgotten about hi boss and the
chief clerk but thei would appear again in hi thought the salesmen
and the apprentic that stupid teaboi two or three friend from
other busi on of the chambermaid from a provinci hotel a
tender memori that appear and disappear again a cashier from a hat
shop for whom hi attent had been seriou but too slowal of them
appear to him mix togeth with stranger and other he had
forgotten but instead of help him and hi famili thei were all of
them inaccess and he wa glad when thei disappear other time
he wa not at all in the mood to look after hi famili he wa fill
with simpl rage about the lack of attent he wa shown and although
he could think of noth he would have want he made plan of how he
could get into the pantri where he could take all the thing he wa
entitl to even if he wa not hungri gregor sister no longer
thought about how she could pleas him but would hurriedli push some
food or other into hi room with her foot befor she rush out to work
in the morn and at middai and in the even she would sweep it
awai again with the broom indiffer as to whether it had been eaten
ormor often than nothad been left total untouch she still
clear up the room in the even but now she could not have been ani
quicker about it smear of dirt were left on the wall here and there
were littl ball of dust and filth at first gregor went into on of
the worst of these place when hi sister arriv as a reproach to her
but he could have stai there for week without hi sister do
anyth about it she could see the dirt as well as he could but she
had simpli decid to leav him to it at the same time she becam
touchi in a wai that wa quit new for her and which everyon in the
famili understoodclean up gregor room wa for her and her alon
gregor mother did onc thoroughli clean hi room and need to us
sever bucket of water to do italthough that much damp also
made gregor ill and he lai flat on the couch bitter and immobil but
hi mother wa to be punish still more for what she had done as
hardli had hi sister arriv home in the even than she notic the
chang in gregor room and highli aggriev ran back into the live
room where despit her mother rais and implor hand she broke
into convuls tear her father of cours wa startl out of hi
chair and the two parent look on astonish and helpless then thei
too becam agit gregor father stand to the right of hi
mother accus her of not leav the clean of gregor room to hi
sister from her left gregor sister scream at her that she wa
never to clean gregor room again while hi mother tri to draw hi
father who wa besid himself with anger into the bedroom hi

and gregor hiss in anger that noon had even thought of close the
door to save him the sight of thi and all it nois
gregor sister wa exhaust from go out to work and look after
gregor as she had done befor wa even more work for her but even so
hi mother ought certainli not to have taken her place gregor on the
other hand ought not to be neglect now though the charwoman wa
here thi elderli widow with a robust bone structur that made her
abl to withstand the hardest of thing in her long life wasnt realli
repel by gregor just by chanc on dai rather than ani real
curios she open the door to gregor room and found herself face
to face with him he wa taken total by surpris noon wa chase
him but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in
amaz with her hand cross in front of her from then on she
never fail to open the door slightli everi even and morn and
look briefli in on him at first she would call to him as she did so
with word that she probabl consid friendli such as come on
then you old dungbeetl or look at the old dungbeetl there
gregor never respond to be spoken to in that wai but just
remain where he wa without move as if the door had never even been
open if onli thei had told thi charwoman to clean up hi room everi
dai instead of let her disturb him for no reason whenev she felt
like it on dai earli in the morn while a heavi rain struck the
windowpan perhap indic that spring wa come she began to
speak to him in that wai onc again gregor wa so resent of it that
he start to move toward her he wa slow and infirm but it wa like
a kind of attack instead of be afraid the charwoman just lift up
on of the chair from near the door and stood there with her mouth
open clearli intend not to close her mouth until the chair in her
hand had been slam down into gregor back arent you come ani
closer then she ask when gregor turn round again and she
calmli put the chair back in the corner
gregor had almost entir stop eat onli if he happen to find
himself next to the food that had been prepar for him he might take
some of it into hi mouth to plai with it leav it there a few hour
and then more often than not spit it out again at first he thought
it wa distress at the state of hi room that stop him eat but
he had soon got us to the chang made there thei had got into the
habit of put thing into thi room that thei had no room for
anywher els and there were now mani such thing as on of the room
in the flat had been rent out to three gentlemen these earnest
gentlemenal three of them had full beard as gregor learn peer
through the crack in the door on daywer painfulli insist on
thing be tidi thi meant not onli in their own room but sinc
thei had taken a room in thi establish in the entir flat and
especi in the kitchen unnecessari clutter wa someth thei could
not toler especi if it wa dirti thei had moreov brought
most of their own furnish and equip with them for thi reason
mani thing had becom superflu which although thei could not be
sold the famili did not wish to discard all these thing found their
wai into gregor room the dustbin from the kitchen found their wai
in there too the charwoman wa alwai in a hurri and anyth she
couldnt us for the time be she would just chuck in there he
fortun would usual see no more than the object and the hand
that held it the woman most like meant to fetch the thing back out
again when she had time and the opportun or to throw everyth out
in on go but what actual happen wa that thei were left where
thei land when thei had first been thrown unless gregor made hi wai
through the junk and move it somewher els at first he move it
becaus with no other room free where he could crawl about he wa
forc to but later on he came to enjoi it although move about in
that wai left him sad and tire to death and he would remain immobil
for hour afterward
the gentlemen who rent the room would sometim take their even
meal at home in the live room that wa us by everyon and so the
door to thi room wa often kept close in the even but gregor
found it easi to give up have the door open he had after all often
fail to make us of it when it wa open and without the famili
have notic it lain in hi room in it darkest corner on time
though the charwoman left the door to the live room slightli open
and it remain open when the gentlemen who rent the room came in in
the even and the light wa put on thei sat up at the tabl where
formerli gregor had taken hi meal with hi father and mother thei
unfold the serviett and pick up their knive and fork gregor
mother immedi appear in the doorwai with a dish of meat and soon
behind her came hi sister with a dish pile high with potato the
food wa steam and fill the room with it smell the gentlemen
bent over the dish set in front of them as if thei want to test the
food befor eat it and the gentleman in the middl who seem to
count as an author for the other two did inde cut off a piec of
meat while it wa still in it dish clearli wish to establish
whether it wa suffici cook or whether it should be sent back to
the kitchen it wa to hi satisfact and gregor mother and
sister who had been look on anxious began to breath again and
smile
the famili themselv at in the kitchen nonetheless gregor father
came into the live room befor he went into the kitchen bow onc
with hi cap in hi hand and did hi round of the tabl the gentlemen
stood as on and mumbl someth into their beard then onc thei
were alon thei at in near perfect silenc it seem remark to
gregor that abov all the variou nois of eat their chew teeth
could still be heard as if thei had want to show gregor that you
need teeth in order to eat and it wa not possibl to perform anyth
with jaw that ar toothless howev nice thei might be id like to
eat someth said gregor anxious but not anyth like theyr
eat thei do feed themselv and here i am dy
throughout all thi time gregor could not rememb have heard the
violin be plai but thi even it began to be heard from the
kitchen the three gentlemen had alreadi finish their meal the on
in the middl had produc a newspap given a page to each of the
other and now thei leant back in their chair read them and
smoke when the violin began plai thei becam attent stood up
and went on tipto over to the door of the hallwai where thei stood
press against each other someon must have heard them in the
kitchen as gregor father call out is the plai perhap
unpleas for the gentlemen we can stop it straight awai on the
contrari said the middl gentleman would the young ladi not like to
come in and plai for us here in the room where it is after all much
more cosi and comfort oh ye wed love to call back
gregor father as if he had been the violin player himself the
gentlemen step back into the room and wait gregor father soon
appear with the music stand hi mother with the music and hi sister
with the violin she calmli prepar everyth for her to begin
plai hi parent who had never rent a room out befor and
therefor show an exagger courtesi toward the three gentlemen
did not even dare to sit on their own chair hi father leant against
the door with hi right hand push in between two button on hi
uniform coat hi mother though wa offer a seat by on of the
gentlemen and satleav the chair where the gentleman happen to
have place itout of the wai in a corner
hi sister began to plai father and mother paid close attent on
on each side to the movement of her hand drawn in by the plai
gregor had dare to come forward a littl and alreadi had hi head in
the live room befor he had taken great pride in how consider he
wa but now it hardli occur to him that he had becom so thoughtless
about the other what more there wa now all the more reason to
keep himself hidden as he wa cover in the dust that lai everywher
in hi room and flew up at the slightest movement he carri thread
hair and remain of food about on hi back and side he wa much too
indiffer to everyth now to lai on hi back and wipe himself on
the carpet like he had us to do sever time a dai and despit thi
condit he wa not too shy to move forward a littl onto the
immacul floor of the live room
noon notic him though the famili wa total preoccupi with the
violin plai at first the three gentlemen had put their hand in
their pocket and come up far too close behind the music stand to look
at all the note be plai and thei must have disturb gregor
sister but soon in contrast with the famili thei withdrew back to
the window with their head sunk and talk to each other at half
volum and thei stai by the window while gregor father observ
them anxious it realli now seem veri obviou that thei had
expect to hear some beauti or entertain violin plai but had
been disappoint that thei had had enough of the whole perform
and it wa onli now out of polit that thei allow their peac to
be disturb it wa especi unnerv the wai thei all blew the
smoke from their cigarett upward from their mouth and nose yet
gregor sister wa plai so beautifulli her face wa leant to on
side follow the line of music with a care and melancholi
express gregor crawl a littl further forward keep hi head
close to the ground so that he could meet her ey if the chanc came
wa he an anim if music could captiv him so it seem to him that
he wa be shown the wai to the unknown nourish he had been
yearn for he wa determin to make hi wai forward to hi sister
and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into hi room with her
violin as noon appreci her plai here as much as he would he
never want to let her out of hi room not while he live anywai
hi shock appear should for onc be of some us to him he
want to be at everi door of hi room at onc to hiss and spit at the
attack hi sister should not be forc to stai with him though
but stai of her own free will she would sit besid him on the couch
with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had alwai
intend to send her to the conservatori how he would have told
everyon about it last christmashad christma realli come and gone
alreadyif thi misfortun hadnt got in the wai and refus to let
anyon dissuad him from it on hear all thi hi sister would
break out in tear of emot and gregor would climb up to her
shoulder and kiss her neck which sinc she had been go out to
work she had kept free without ani necklac or collar
mr samsa shout the middl gentleman to gregor father
point without wast ani more word with hi forefing at gregor
as he slowli move forward the violin went silent the middl of the
three gentlemen first smile at hi two friend shake hi head and
then look back at gregor hi father seem to think it more
import to calm the three gentlemen befor drive gregor out even
though thei were not at all upset and seem to think gregor wa more
entertain than the violin plai had been he rush up to them
with hi arm spread out and attempt to drive them back into their
room at the same time as try to block their view of gregor with hi
bodi now thei did becom a littl annoi and it wa not clear
whether it wa hi father behaviour that annoi them or the dawn
realis that thei had had a neighbour like gregor in the next room
without know it thei ask gregor father for explan rais
their arm like he had tug excitedli at their beard and move back
toward their room onli veri slowli meanwhil gregor sister had
overcom the despair she had fallen into when her plai wa suddenli
interrupt she had let her hand drop and let violin and bow hang
limpli for a while but continu to look at the music as if still
plai but then she suddenli pull herself togeth lai the
instrument on her mother lap who still sat labori struggl for
breath where she wa and ran into the next room which under pressur
from her father the three gentlemen were more quickli move toward
under hi sister experienc hand the pillow and cover on the bed
flew up and were put into order and she had alreadi finish make the
bed and slip out again befor the three gentlemen had reach the
room gregor father seem so obsess with what he wa do that he
forgot all the respect he ow to hi tenant he urg them and
press them until when he wa alreadi at the door of the room the
middl of the three gentlemen shout like thunder and stamp hi foot
and therebi brought gregor father to a halt i declar here and
now he said rais hi hand and glanc at gregor mother and
sister to gain their attent too that with regard to the repugn
condit that prevail in thi flat and with thi familyher he
look briefli but decis at the floori give immedi notic on
my room for the dai that i have been live here i will of cours
pai noth at all on the contrari i will consid whether to proce
with some kind of action for damag from you and believ me it would
be veri easi to set out the ground for such an action he wa silent
and look straight ahead as if wait for someth and inde hi
two friend join in with the word and we also give immedi
notic with that he took hold of the door handl and slam the
door
gregor father stagger back to hi seat feel hi wai with hi
hand and fell into it it look as if he wa stretch himself out
for hi usual even nap but from the uncontrol wai hi head kept
nod it could be seen that he wa not sleep at all throughout
all thi gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first
seen him hi disappoint at the failur of hi plan and perhap
also becaus he wa weak from hunger made it imposs for him to
move he wa sure that everyon would turn on him ani moment and he
wait he wa not even startl out of thi state when the violin on
hi mother lap fell from her trembl finger and land loudli on
the floor
father mother said hi sister hit the tabl with her hand as

who still had not had time to catch her breath began to cough dulli
her hand held out in front of her and a derang express in her
ey
gregor sister rush to hi mother and put her hand on her forehead
her word seem to give gregor father some more definit idea he
sat upright plai with hi uniform cap between the plate left by the
three gentlemen after their meal and occasion look down at

broke out so heavili in tear that thei flow down the face of her
mother and she wipe them awai with mechan hand movement
my child said her father with sympathi and obviou understand
what ar we to do
hi sister just shrug her shoulder as a sign of the helpless
and tear that had taken hold of her displac her earlier certainti

ey in accept of hi sister certainti that that wa quit
imposs then perhap we could come to some kind of arrang
with him but as it is
it got to go shout hi sister that the onli wai father
youv got to get rid of the idea that that gregor weve onli harm
ourselv by believ it for so long how can that be gregor if it
were gregor he would have seen long ago that it not possibl for
human be to live with an anim like that and he would have gone of
hi own free will we wouldnt have a brother ani more then but we
could carri on with our live and rememb him with respect as it is
thi anim is persecut us it driven out our tenant it
obvious want to take over the whole flat and forc us to sleep on
the street father look just look she suddenli scream he
start again in her alarm which wa total beyond gregor
comprehens hi sister even abandon hi mother as she push
herself vigor out of her chair as if more will to sacrific her
own mother than stai anywher near gregor she rush over to behind
her father who had becom excit mere becaus she wa and stood up
half rais hi hand in front of gregor sister as if to protect
her
but gregor had had no intent of frighten anyon least of all hi
sister all he had done wa begin to turn round so that he could go
back into hi room although that wa in itself quit startl as hi
painwrack condit meant that turn round requir a great deal
of effort and he wa us hi head to help himself do it repeatedli
rais it and strike it against the floor he stop and look
round thei seem to have realis hi good intent and had onli
been alarm briefli now thei all look at him in unhappi silenc
hi mother lai in her chair with her leg stretch out and press
against each other her ey nearli close with exhaust hi sister
sat next to hi father with her arm around hi neck
mayb now theyll let me turn round thought gregor and went back to
work he could not help pant loudli with the effort and had
sometim to stop and take a rest noon wa make him rush ani more
everyth wa left up to him as soon as he had final finish
turn round he began to move straight ahead he wa amaz at the
great distanc that separ him from hi room and could not
understand how he had cover that distanc in hi weak state a littl
while befor and almost without notic it he concentr on
crawl as fast as he could and hardli notic that there wa not a
word not ani cry from hi famili to distract him he did not turn hi
head until he had reach the doorwai he did not turn it all the wai
round as he felt hi neck becom stiff but it wa nonetheless enough
to see that noth behind him had chang onli hi sister had stood
up with hi last glanc he saw that hi mother had now fallen
complet asleep
he wa hardli insid hi room befor the door wa hurriedli shut
bolt and lock the sudden nois behind gregor so startl him that
hi littl leg collaps under him it wa hi sister who had been in
so much of a rush she had been stand there wait and sprung
forward lightli gregor had not heard her come at all and as she
turn the kei in the lock she said loudli to her parent at last
what now then gregor ask himself as he look round in the
dark he soon made the discoveri that he could no longer move at
all thi wa no surpris to him it seem rather that be abl to
actual move around on those spindli littl leg until then wa
unnatur he also felt rel comfort it is true that hi
entir bodi wa ach but the pain seem to be slowli get weaker
and weaker and would final disappear altogeth he could alreadi
hardli feel the decai appl in hi back or the inflam area around
it which wa entir cover in white dust he thought back of hi
famili with emot and love if it wa possibl he felt that he must
go awai even more strongli than hi sister he remain in thi state
of empti and peac rumin until he heard the clock tower strike
three in the morn he watch as it slowli began to get light
everywher outsid the window too then without hi will it hi
head sank down complet and hi last breath flow weakli from hi
nostril
when the cleaner came in earli in the morningtheyd often ask her
not to keep slam the door but with her strength and in her hurri
she still did so that everyon in the flat knew when shed arriv and
from then on it wa imposs to sleep in peacesh made her usual
brief look in on gregor and at first found noth special she thought
he wa lai there so still on purpos plai the martyr she
attribut all possibl understand to him she happen to be
hold the long broom in her hand so she tri to tickl gregor with
it from the doorwai when she had no success with that she tri to
make a nuisanc of herself and poke at him a littl and onli when she
found she could shove him across the floor with no resist at all
did she start to pai attent she soon realis what had realli
happen open her ey wide whistl to herself but did not wast
time to yank open the bedroom door and shout loudli into the dark
of the bedroom come and av a look at thi it dead just ly
there stone dead
mr and mr samsa sat upright there in their marriag bed and had to
make an effort to get over the shock caus by the cleaner befor thei
could grasp what she wa sai but then each from hi own side thei
hurri out of bed mr samsa threw the blanket over hi shoulder
mr samsa just came out in her nightdress and that is how thei went
into gregor room on the wai thei open the door to the live room
where grete had been sleep sinc the three gentlemen had move in
she wa fulli dress as if she had never been asleep and the pale
of her face seem to confirm thi dead ask mr samsa look
at the charwoman enquiringli even though she could have check for
herself and could have known it even without check that what i
said repli the cleaner and to prove it she gave gregor bodi
anoth shove with the broom send it sidewai across the floor
mr samsa made a movement as if she want to hold back the broom but
did not complet it now then said mr samsa let give thank to
god for that he cross himself and the three women follow hi
exampl grete who had not taken her ey from the corps said just
look how thin he wa he didnt eat anyth for so long the food came
out again just the same as when it went in gregor bodi wa inde
complet dri up and flat thei had not seen it until then but now
he wa not lift up on hi littl leg nor did he do anyth to make
them look awai
grete come with us in here for a littl while said mr samsa with
a pain smile and grete follow her parent into the bedroom but not
without look back at the bodi the cleaner shut the door and open
the window wide although it wa still earli in the morn the fresh
air had someth of warmth mix in with it it wa alreadi the end of
march after all
the three gentlemen step out of their room and look round in
amaz for their breakfast thei had been forgotten about where
is our breakfast the middl gentleman ask the cleaner irrit
she just put her finger on her lip and made a quick and silent sign to
the men that thei might like to come into gregor room thei did so
and stood around gregor corps with their hand in the pocket of
their wellworn coat it wa now quit light in the room
then the door of the bedroom open and mr samsa appear in hi
uniform with hi wife on on arm and hi daughter on the other all of
them had been cry a littl grete now and then press her face
against her father arm
leav my home now said mr samsa indic the door and without
let the women from him what do you mean ask the middl of
the three gentlemen somewhat disconcert and he smile sweetli the
other two held their hand behind their back and continu rub
them togeth in gleeful anticip of a loud quarrel which could
onli end in their favour i mean just what i said answer mr
samsa and with hi two companion went in a straight line toward
the man at first he stood there still look at the ground as if
the content of hi head were rearrang themselv into new
posit alright well go then he said and look up at mr
samsa as if he had been suddenli overcom with humil and want
permiss again from mr samsa for hi decis mr samsa mere
open hi ey wide and briefli nod to him sever time at that
and without delai the man actual did take long stride into the
front hallwai hi two friend had stop rub their hand some
time befor and had been listen to what wa be said now thei
jump off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that mr
samsa might go into the hallwai in front of them and break the
connect with their leader onc there all three took their hat
from the stand took their stick from the holder bow without a word
and left the premis mr samsa and the two women follow them out
onto the land but thei had had no reason to mistrust the men
intent and as thei lean over the land thei saw how the three
gentlemen made slow but steadi progress down the mani step as thei
turn the corner on each floor thei disappear and would reappear a
few moment later the further down thei went the more that the samsa
famili lost interest in them when a butcher boi proud of postur
with hi trai on hi head pass them on hi wai up and came nearer
than thei were mr samsa and the women came awai from the land and
went as if reliev back into the flat
thei decid the best wai to make us of that dai wa for relax
and to go for a walk not onli had thei earn a break from work but
thei were in seriou need of it so thei sat at the tabl and wrote
three letter of excus mr samsa to hi employ mr samsa to her
contractor and grete to her princip the cleaner came in while thei
were write to tell them she wa go shed finish her work for
that morn the three of them at first just nod without look up
from what thei were write and it wa onli when the cleaner still did
not seem to want to leav that thei look up in irrit well
ask mr samsa the charwoman stood in the doorwai with a smile on her
face as if she had some tremend good new to report but would onli
do it if she wa clearli ask to the almost vertic littl ostrich
feather on her hat which had been a sourc of irrit to mr samsa
all the time she had been work for them swai gentli in all
direct what is it you want then ask mr samsa whom the
cleaner had the most respect for ye she answer and broke into a
friendli laugh that made her unabl to speak straight awai well then
that thing in there you neednt worri about how your go to get
rid of it that all been sort out mr samsa and grete bent down
over their letter as if intent on continu with what thei were
write mr samsa saw that the cleaner want to start describ
everyth in detail but with outstretch hand he made it quit
clear that she wa not to so as she wa prevent from tell them
all about it she suddenli rememb what a hurri she wa in and
clearli peev call out cheerio then everyon turn round
sharpli and left slam the door terribl as she went
tonight she get sack said mr samsa but he receiv no repli
from either hi wife or hi daughter as the charwoman seem to have
destroi the peac thei had onli just gain thei got up and went
over to the window where thei remain with their arm around each
other mr samsa twist round in hi chair to look at them and sat
there watch for a while then he call out come here then let
forget about all that old stuff shall we come and give me a bit of
attent the two women immedi did as he said hurri over to
him where thei kiss him and hug him and then thei quickli finish
their letter
after that the three of them left the flat togeth which wa
someth thei had not done for month and took the tram out to the
open countri outsid the town thei had the tram fill with warm
sunshin all to themselv leant back comfort on their seat
thei discuss their prospect and found that on closer examin
thei were not at all baduntil then thei had never ask each other
about their work but all three had job which were veri good and held
particularli good promis for the futur the greatest improv for
the time be of cours would be achiev quit easili by move
hous what thei need now wa a flat that wa smaller and cheaper
than the current on which had been chosen by gregor on that wa in a
better locat and most of all more practic all the time grete
wa becom liveli with all the worri thei had been have of late
her cheek had becom pale but while thei were talk mr and mr
samsa were struck almost simultan with the thought of how their
daughter wa blossom into a well built and beauti young ladi
thei becam quieter just from each other glanc and almost without
know it thei agre that it would soon be time to find a good man
for her and as if in confirm of their new dream and good
intent as soon as thei reach their destin grete wa the
first to get up and stretch out her young bodi
