3 mai bistritzleft munich at 835 p m on 1st mai arriv at
vienna earli next morn should have arriv at 646 but train wa an
hour late budapesth seem a wonder place from the glimps which i
got of it from the train and the littl i could walk through the
street i fear to go veri far from the station as we had arriv
late and would start as near the correct time as possibl the
impress i had wa that we were leav the west and enter the
east the most western of splendid bridg over the danub which is
here of nobl width and depth took us among the tradit of turkish
rule
we left in pretti good time and came after nightfal to klausenburgh
here i stop for the night at the hotel royal i had for dinner or
rather supper a chicken done up some wai with red pepper which wa
veri good but thirsti mem get recip for mina i ask the
waiter and he said it wa call paprika hendl and that as it wa a
nation dish i should be abl to get it anywher along the
carpathian i found my smatter of german veri us here inde i
dont know how i should be abl to get on without it
have had some time at my dispos when in london i had visit the
british museum and made search among the book and map in the librari
regard transylvania it had struck me that some foreknowledg of the
countri could hardli fail to have some import in deal with a
nobleman of that countri i find that the district he name is in the
extrem east of the countri just on the border of three state
transylvania moldavia and bukovina in the midst of the carpathian
mountain on of the wildest and least known portion of europ i wa
not abl to light on ani map or work give the exact local of the
castl dracula as there ar no map of thi countri as yet to compar
with our own ordnanc survei map but i found that bistritz the post
town name by count dracula is a fairli wellknown place i shall enter
here some of my note as thei mai refresh my memori when i talk over my
travel with mina
in the popul of transylvania there ar four distinct nation
saxon in the south and mix with them the wallach who ar the
descend of the dacian magyar in the west and szeke in the
east and north i am go among the latter who claim to be descend
from attila and the hun thi mai be so for when the magyar conquer
the countri in the eleventh centuri thei found the hun settl in it i
read that everi known superstit in the world is gather into the
horsesho of the carpathian as if it were the centr of some sort of
imagin whirlpool if so my stai mai be veri interest mem i
must ask the count all about them
i did not sleep well though my bed wa comfort enough for i had
all sort of queer dream there wa a dog howl all night under my
window which mai have had someth to do with it or it mai have been
the paprika for i had to drink up all the water in my caraf and wa
still thirsti toward morn i slept and wa waken by the continu
knock at my door so i guess i must have been sleep soundli then
i had for breakfast more paprika and a sort of porridg of maiz flour
which thei said wa mamaliga and eggplant stuf with forcemeat a
veri excel dish which thei call impletata mem get recip
for thi also i had to hurri breakfast for the train start a littl
befor eight or rather it ought to have done so for after rush to
the station at 730 i had to sit in the carriag for more than an hour
befor we began to move it seem to me that the further east you go the
more unpunctu ar the train what ought thei to be in china
all dai long we seem to dawdl through a countri which wa full of
beauti of everi kind sometim we saw littl town or castl on the
top of steep hill such as we see in old missal sometim we ran by
river and stream which seem from the wide stoni margin on each side
of them to be subject to great flood it take a lot of water and
run strong to sweep the outsid edg of a river clear at everi
station there were group of peopl sometim crowd and in all sort
of attir some of them were just like the peasant at home or those i
saw come through franc and germani with short jacket and round hat
and homemad trouser but other were veri picturesqu the women
look pretti except when you got near them but thei were veri clumsi
about the waist thei had all full white sleev of some kind or other
and most of them had big belt with a lot of strip of someth
flutter from them like the dress in a ballet but of cours there
were petticoat under them the strangest figur we saw were the
slovak who were more barbarian than the rest with their big cowboi
hat great baggi dirtywhit trouser white linen shirt and enorm
heavi leather belt nearli a foot wide all stud over with brass
nail thei wore high boot with their trouser tuck into them and
had long black hair and heavi black moustach thei ar veri
picturesqu but do not look prepossess on the stage thei would be
set down at onc as some old orient band of brigand thei ar
howev i am told veri harmless and rather want in natur
selfassert
it wa on the dark side of twilight when we got to bistritz which is a
veri interest old place be practic on the frontierfor the
borgo pass lead from it into bukovinait ha had a veri stormi
exist and it certainli show mark of it fifti year ago a seri
of great fire took place which made terribl havoc on five separ
occas at the veri begin of the seventeenth centuri it underw
a sieg of three week and lost 13000 peopl the casualti of war
proper be assist by famin and diseas
count dracula had direct me to go to the golden krone hotel which i
found to my great delight to be thoroughli oldfashion for of
cours i want to see all i could of the wai of the countri i wa
evid expect for when i got near the door i face a
cheerylook elderli woman in the usual peasant dresswhit
undergar with long doubl apron front and back of colour stuff
fit almost too tight for modesti when i came close she bow and
said the herr englishman ye i said jonathan harker she
smile and gave some messag to an elderli man in white shirtsleev
who had follow her to the door he went but immedi return with
a letter

4 mayi found that my landlord had got a letter from the count
direct him to secur the best place on the coach for me but on
make inquiri as to detail he seem somewhat retic and
pretend that he could not understand my german thi could not be
true becaus up to then he had understood it perfectli at least he
answer my question exactli as if he did he and hi wife the old
ladi who had receiv me look at each other in a frighten sort of
wai he mumbl out that the monei had been sent in a letter and that
wa all he knew when i ask him if he knew count dracula and could
tell me anyth of hi castl both he and hi wife cross themselv
and sai that thei knew noth at all simpli refus to speak
further it wa so near the time of start that i had no time to ask
ani on els for it wa all veri mysteri and not by ani mean
comfort
just befor i wa leav the old ladi came up to my room and said in a
veri hyster wai
must you go oh young herr must you go she wa in such an excit
state that she seem to have lost her grip of what german she knew and
mix it all up with some other languag which i did not know at all i
wa just abl to follow her by ask mani question when i told her
that i must go at onc and that i wa engag on import busi
she ask again
do you know what dai it is i answer that it wa the fourth of mai
she shook her head as she said again
oh ye i know that i know that but do you know what dai it is on
my sai that i did not understand she went on
it is the ev of st georg dai do you not know that tonight when
the clock strike midnight all the evil thing in the world will have
full swai do you know where you ar go and what you ar go to
she wa in such evid distress that i tri to comfort her but
without effect final she went down on her knee and implor me not
to go at least to wait a dai or two befor start it wa all veri
ridicul but i did not feel comfort howev there wa busi
to be done and i could allow noth to interfer with it i therefor
tri to rais her up and said as grave as i could that i thank
her but my duti wa imper and that i must go she then rose and
dri her ey and take a crucifix from her neck offer it to me i
did not know what to do for as an english churchman i have been
taught to regard such thing as in some measur idolatr and yet it
seem so ungraci to refus an old ladi mean so well and in such a
state of mind she saw i suppos the doubt in my face for she put the
rosari round my neck and said for your mother sake and went out
of the room i am write up thi part of the diari whilst i am wait
for the coach which is of cours late and the crucifix is still
round my neck whether it is the old ladi fear or the mani ghostli
tradit of thi place or the crucifix itself i do not know but i
am not feel nearli as easi in my mind as usual if thi book should
ever reach mina befor i do let it bring my goodby here come the
coach
5 mai the castleth grei of the morn ha pass and the sun is
high over the distant horizon which seem jag whether with tree or
hill i know not for it is so far off that big thing and littl ar
mix i am not sleepi and as i am not to be call till i awak
natur i write till sleep come there ar mani odd thing to put
down and lest who read them mai fanci that i dine too well befor i
left bistritz let me put down my dinner exactli i dine on what thei
call robber steakbit of bacon onion and beef season with red
pepper and strung on stick and roast over the fire in the simpl
style of the london cat meat the wine wa golden mediasch which
produc a queer sting on the tongu which is howev not
disagre i had onli a coupl of glass of thi and noth els
when i got on the coach the driver had not taken hi seat and i saw him
talk with the landladi thei were evid talk of me for everi
now and then thei look at me and some of the peopl who were sit
on the bench outsid the doorwhich thei call by a name mean
wordbearercam and listen and then look at me most of them
pityingli i could hear a lot of word often repeat queer word for
there were mani nation in the crowd so i quietli got my polyglot
dictionari from my bag and look them out i must sai thei were not
cheer to me for amongst them were ordogsatan pokolhel
stregoicawitch vrolok and vlkoslakboth of which mean the same
thing on be slovak and the other servian for someth that is
either werewolf or vampir mem i must ask the count about these
superstit
when we start the crowd round the inn door which had by thi time
swell to a consider size all made the sign of the cross and
point two finger toward me with some difficulti i got a
fellowpasseng to tell me what thei meant he would not answer at
first but on learn that i wa english he explain that it wa a
charm or guard against the evil ey thi wa not veri pleasant for me
just start for an unknown place to meet an unknown man but everi on
seem so kindheart and so sorrow and so sympathet that i
could not but be touch i shall never forget the last glimps which i
had of the innyard and it crowd of picturesqu figur all cross
themselv as thei stood round the wide archwai with it background of
rich foliag of oleand and orang tree in green tub cluster in the
centr of the yard then our driver whose wide linen drawer cover
the whole front of the boxseatgotza thei call themcrack hi big
whip over hi four small hors which ran abreast and we set off on
our journei
i soon lost sight and recollect of ghostli fear in the beauti of the
scene as we drove along although had i known the languag or rather
languag which my fellowpasseng were speak i might not have
been abl to throw them off so easili befor us lai a green slope
land full of forest and wood with here and there steep hill crown
with clump of tree or with farmhous the blank gabl end to the
road there wa everywher a bewild mass of fruit blossomappl
plum pear cherri and as we drove by i could see the green grass under
the tree spangl with the fallen petal in and out amongst these
green hill of what thei call here the mittel land ran the road
lose itself as it swept round the grassi curv or wa shut out by the
straggl end of pine wood which here and there ran down the
hillsid like tongu of flame the road wa rug but still we
seem to fly over it with a feverish hast i could not understand then
what the hast meant but the driver wa evid bent on lose no
time in reach borgo prund i wa told that thi road is in summertim
excel but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter
snow in thi respect it is differ from the gener run of road in
the carpathian for it is an old tradit that thei ar not to be kept
in too good order of old the hospadar would not repair them lest the
turk should think that thei were prepar to bring in foreign troop
and so hasten the war which wa alwai realli at load point
beyond the green swell hill of the mittel land rose mighti slope
of forest up to the lofti steep of the carpathian themselv right
and left of us thei tower with the afternoon sun fall full upon
them and bring out all the gloriou colour of thi beauti rang
deep blue and purpl in the shadow of the peak green and brown where
grass and rock mingl and an endless perspect of jag rock and
point crag till these were themselv lost in the distanc where
the snowi peak rose grandli here and there seem mighti rift in the
mountain through which as the sun began to sink we saw now and again
the white gleam of fall water on of my companion touch my arm as
we swept round the base of a hill and open up the lofti snowcov
peak of a mountain which seem as we wound on our serpentin wai to
be right befor us
look isten szekgod seatand he cross himself rever
as we wound on our endless wai and the sun sank lower and lower behind
us the shadow of the even began to creep round us thi wa
emphasis by the fact that the snowi mountaintop still held the
sunset and seem to glow out with a delic cool pink here and there
we pass cszek and slovak all in picturesqu attir but i notic
that goitr wa painfulli preval by the roadsid were mani cross
and as we swept by my companion all cross themselv here and there
wa a peasant man or woman kneel befor a shrine who did not even
turn round as we approach but seem in the selfsurrend of
devot to have neither ey nor ear for the outer world there were
mani thing new to me for instanc hayrick in the tree and here
and there veri beauti mass of weep birch their white stem
shine like silver through the delic green of the leav now and
again we pass a leiterwagonth ordinari peasant cartwith it
long snakelik vertebra calcul to suit the inequ of the
road on thi were sure to be seat quit a group of homecom
peasant the cszek with their white and the slovak with their
colour sheepskin the latter carri lancefashion their long
stave with ax at end as the even fell it began to get veri cold
and the grow twilight seem to merg into on dark misti the
gloom of the tree oak beech and pine though in the vallei which
ran deep between the spur of the hill as we ascend through the
pass the dark fir stood out here and there against the background of
late snow sometim as the road wa cut through the pine wood
that seem in the dark to be close down upon us great mass of
grey which here and there bestrew the tree produc a
peculiarli weird and solemn effect which carri on the thought and
grim fanci engend earlier in the even when the fall sunset
threw into strang relief the ghostlik cloud which amongst the
carpathian seem to wind ceaselessli through the vallei sometim the
hill were so steep that despit our driver hast the hors could
onli go slowli i wish to get down and walk up them as we do at home
but the driver would not hear of it no no he said you must not
walk here the dog ar too fierc and then he ad with what he
evid meant for grim pleasantryfor he look round to catch the
approv smile of the restand you mai have enough of such matter
befor you go to sleep the onli stop he would make wa a moment
paus to light hi lamp
when it grew dark there seem to be some excit amongst the
passeng and thei kept speak to him on after the other as
though urg him to further speed he lash the hors unmercifulli
with hi long whip and with wild cri of encourag urg them on
to further exert then through the dark i could see a sort of
patch of grei light ahead of us as though there were a cleft in the
hill the excit of the passeng grew greater the crazi coach
rock on it great leather spring and swai like a boat toss on a
stormi sea i had to hold on the road grew more level and we appear
to fly along then the mountain seem to come nearer to us on each
side and to frown down upon us we were enter on the borgo pass on
by on sever of the passeng offer me gift which thei press
upon me with an earnest which would take no denial these were
certainli of an odd and vari kind but each wa given in simpl good
faith with a kindli word and a bless and that strang mixtur of
fearmean movement which i had seen outsid the hotel at
bistritzth sign of the cross and the guard against the evil ey
then as we flew along the driver lean forward and on each side the
passeng crane over the edg of the coach peer eagerli into the
dark it wa evid that someth veri excit wa either
happen or expect but though i ask each passeng no on would
give me the slightest explan thi state of excit kept on for
some littl time and at last we saw befor us the pass open out on
the eastern side there were dark roll cloud overhead and in the
air the heavi oppress sens of thunder it seem as though the
mountain rang had separ two atmospher and that now we had got
into the thunder on i wa now myself look out for the convey
which wa to take me to the count each moment i expect to see the
glare of lamp through the black but all wa dark the onli light
wa the flicker rai of our own lamp in which the steam from our
harddriven hors rose in a white cloud we could see now the sandi
road ly white befor us but there wa on it no sign of a vehicl
the passeng drew back with a sigh of glad which seem to mock
my own disappoint i wa alreadi think what i had best do when
the driver look at hi watch said to the other someth which i
could hardli hear it wa spoken so quietli and in so low a tone i
thought it wa an hour less than the time then turn to me he said
in german wors than my own
there is no carriag here the herr is not expect after all he will
now come on to bukovina and return tomorrow or the next dai better
the next dai whilst he wa speak the hors began to neigh and
snort and plung wildli so that the driver had to hold them up then
amongst a choru of scream from the peasant and a univers cross
of themselv a calch with four hors drove up behind us overtook
us and drew up besid the coach i could see from the flash of our
lamp as the rai fell on them that the hors were coalblack and
splendid anim thei were driven by a tall man with a long brown
beard and a great black hat which seem to hide hi face from us i
could onli see the gleam of a pair of veri bright ey which seem red
in the lamplight as he turn to us he said to the driver
you ar earli tonight my friend the man stammer in repli
the english herr wa in a hurri to which the stranger repli
that is why i suppos you wish him to go on to bukovina you cannot
deceiv me my friend i know too much and my hors ar swift as he
spoke he smile and the lamplight fell on a hardlook mouth with
veri red lip and sharplook teeth as white as ivori on of my
companion whisper to anoth the line from burger lenor
denn die todten reiten schnell
for the dead travel fast
the strang driver evid heard the word for he look up with a
gleam smile the passeng turn hi face awai at the same time
put out hi two finger and cross himself give me the herr
luggag said the driver and with exceed alacr my bag were
hand out and put in the calch then i descend from the side of the
coach as the calch wa close alongsid the driver help me with a
hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel hi strength must have been
prodigi without a word he shook hi rein the hors turn and we
swept into the dark of the pass as i look back i saw the steam
from the hors of the coach by the light of the lamp and project
against it the figur of my late companion cross themselv then
the driver crack hi whip and call to hi hors and off thei swept
on their wai to bukovina as thei sank into the dark i felt a
strang chill and a lone feel came over me but a cloak wa thrown
over my shoulder and a rug across my knee and the driver said in
excel german
the night is chill mein herr and my master the count bade me take all
care of you there is a flask of slivovitz the plum brandi of the
countri underneath the seat if you should requir it i did not take
ani but it wa a comfort to know it wa there all the same i felt a
littl strang and not a littl frighten i think had there been
ani altern i should have taken it instead of prosecut that
unknown night journei the carriag went at a hard pace straight along
then we made a complet turn and went along anoth straight road it
seem to me that we were simpli go over and over the same ground
again and so i took note of some salient point and found that thi wa
so i would have like to have ask the driver what thi all meant but
i realli fear to do so for i thought that place as i wa ani
protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intent to
delai byandbi howev as i wa curiou to know how time wa
pass i struck a match and by it flame look at my watch it wa
within a few minut of midnight thi gave me a sort of shock for i
suppos the gener superstit about midnight wa increas by my
recent experi i wait with a sick feel of suspens
then a dog began to howl somewher in a farmhous far down the roada
long agonis wail as if from fear the sound wa taken up by
anoth dog and then anoth and anoth till born on the wind which
now sigh softli through the pass a wild howl began which seem
to come from all over the countri as far as the imagin could grasp
it through the gloom of the night at the first howl the hors began to
strain and rear but the driver spoke to them soothingli and thei
quiet down but shiver and sweat as though after a runawai from
sudden fright then far off in the distanc from the mountain on each
side of us began a louder and a sharper howlingthat of wolveswhich
affect both the hors and myself in the same wayfor i wa mind to
jump from the calch and run whilst thei rear again and plung
madli so that the driver had to us all hi great strength to keep them
from bolt in a few minut howev my own ear got accustom to
the sound and the hors so far becam quiet that the driver wa abl
to descend and to stand befor them he pet and sooth them and
whisper someth in their ear as i have heard of horsetam
do and with extraordinari effect for under hi caress thei becam
quit manag again though thei still trembl the driver again
took hi seat and shake hi rein start off at a great pace thi
time after go to the far side of the pass he suddenli turn down a
narrow roadwai which ran sharpli to the right
soon we were hem in with tree which in place arch right over the
roadwai till we pass as through a tunnel and again great frown
rock guard us boldli on either side though we were in shelter we
could hear the rise wind for it moan and whistl through the
rock and the branch of the tree crash togeth as we swept along
it grew colder and colder still and fine powderi snow began to fall
so that soon we and all around us were cover with a white blanket the
keen wind still carri the howl of the dog though thi grew
fainter as we went on our wai the bai of the wolv sound nearer
and nearer as though thei were close round on us from everi side i
grew dreadfulli afraid and the hors share my fear the driver
howev wa not in the least disturb he kept turn hi head to
left and right but i could not see anyth through the dark
suddenli awai on our left i saw a faint flicker blue flame the
driver saw it at the same moment he at onc check the hors and
jump to the ground disappear into the dark i did not know
what to do the less as the howl of the wolv grew closer but while
i wonder the driver suddenli appear again and without a word took
hi seat and we resum our journei i think i must have fallen asleep
and kept dream of the incid for it seem to be repeat
endlessli and now look back it is like a sort of aw nightmar
onc the flame appear so near the road that even in the dark
around us i could watch the driver motion he went rapidli to where
the blue flame aroseit must have been veri faint for it did not seem
to illumin the place around it at alland gather a few stone
form them into some devic onc there appear a strang optic
effect when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it
for i could see it ghostli flicker all the same thi startl me but
as the effect wa onli momentari i took it that my ey deceiv me
strain through the dark then for a time there were no blue
flame and we sped onward through the gloom with the howl of the
wolv around us as though thei were follow in a move circl
at last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he
had yet gone and dure hi absenc the hors began to trembl wors
than ever and to snort and scream with fright i could not see ani caus
for it for the howl of the wolv had ceas altogeth but just
then the moon sail through the black cloud appear behind the
jag crest of a beetl pineclad rock and by it light i saw
around us a ring of wolv with white teeth and loll red tongu
with long sinewi limb and shaggi hair thei were a hundr time more
terribl in the grim silenc which held them than even when thei howl
for myself i felt a sort of paralysi of fear it is onli when a man
feel himself face to face with such horror that he can understand
their true import
all at onc the wolv began to howl as though the moonlight had had
some peculiar effect on them the hors jump about and rear and
look helplessli round with ey that roll in a wai pain to see
but the live ring of terror encompass them on everi side and thei
had perforc to remain within it i call to the coachman to come for
it seem to me that our onli chanc wa to try to break out through the
ring and to aid hi approach i shout and beat the side of the
calch hope by the nois to scare the wolv from that side so as
to give him a chanc of reach the trap how he came there i know
not but i heard hi voic rais in a tone of imperi command and
look toward the sound saw him stand in the roadwai as he swept hi
long arm as though brush asid some impalp obstacl the wolv
fell back and back further still just then a heavi cloud pass across
the face of the moon so that we were again in dark
when i could see again the driver wa climb into the calch and the
wolv had disappear thi wa all so strang and uncanni that a
dread fear came upon me and i wa afraid to speak or move the time
seem intermin as we swept on our wai now in almost complet
dark for the roll cloud obscur the moon we kept on
ascend with occasion period of quick descent but in the main
alwai ascend suddenli i becam consciou of the fact that the
driver wa in the act of pull up the hors in the courtyard of a
vast ruin castl from whose tall black window came no rai of light
and whose broken battlement show a jag line against the moonlit
sky

5 mayi must have been asleep for certainli if i had been fulli
awak i must have notic the approach of such a remark place in
the gloom the courtyard look of consider size and as sever dark
wai led from it under great round arch it perhap seem bigger than
it realli is i have not yet been abl to see it by daylight
when the calch stop the driver jump down and held out hi hand
to assist me to alight again i could not but notic hi prodigi
strength hi hand actual seem like a steel vice that could have
crush mine if he had chosen then he took out my trap and place
them on the ground besid me as i stood close to a great door old and
stud with larg iron nail and set in a project doorwai of
massiv stone i could see even in the dim light that the stone wa
massiv carv but that the carv had been much worn by time and
weather as i stood the driver jump again into hi seat and shook the
rein the hors start forward and trap and all disappear down on
of the dark open
i stood in silenc where i wa for i did not know what to do of bell
or knocker there wa no sign through these frown wall and dark
window open it wa not like that my voic could penetr the
time i wait seem endless and i felt doubt and fear crowd upon
me what sort of place had i come to and among what kind of peopl
what sort of grim adventur wa it on which i had embark wa thi a
customari incid in the life of a solicitor clerk sent out to
explain the purchas of a london estat to a foreign solicitor
clerk mina would not like that solicitorfor just befor leav
london i got word that my examin wa success and i am now a
fullblown solicitor i began to rub my ey and pinch myself to see if
i were awak it all seem like a horribl nightmar to me and i
expect that i should suddenli awak and find myself at home with

in the morn after a dai of overwork but my flesh answer the
pinch test and my ey were not to be deceiv i wa inde awak
and among the carpathian all i could do now wa to be patient and to
wait the come of the morn
just as i had come to thi conclus i heard a heavi step approach
behind the great door and saw through the chink the gleam of a come
light then there wa the sound of rattl chain and the clank of
massiv bolt drawn back a kei wa turn with the loud grate nois
of long disus and the great door swung back
within stood a tall old man clean shaven save for a long white
moustach and clad in black from head to foot without a singl speck
of colour about him anywher he held in hi hand an antiqu silver
lamp in which the flame burn without chimnei or globe of ani kind
throw long quiver shadow as it flicker in the draught of the
open door the old man motion me in with hi right hand with a courtli
gestur sai in excel english but with a strang inton
welcom to my hous enter freeli and of your own will he made no
motion of step to meet me but stood like a statu as though hi
gestur of welcom had fix him into stone the instant howev that
i had step over the threshold he move impuls forward and
hold out hi hand grasp mine with a strength which made me winc
an effect which wa not lessen by the fact that it seem as cold as
icemor like the hand of a dead than a live man again he said
welcom to my hous come freeli go safe and leav someth of the
happi you bring the strength of the handshak wa so much akin to
that which i had notic in the driver whose face i had not seen that

speak so to make sure i said interrog
count dracula he bow in a courtli wai as he repli

to see within a welllit room in which a tabl wa spread for supper
and on whose mighti hearth a great fire of log freshli replenish
flame and flare

question as to my journei and i told him by degre all i had
experienc
by thi time i had finish my supper and by my host desir had drawn
up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offer me
at the same time excus himself that he did not smoke i had now an
opportun of observ him and found him of a veri mark
physiognomi
hi face wa a stronga veri strongaquilin with high bridg of the
thin nose and peculiarli arch nostril with lofti dome forehead and
hair grow scantili round the templ but profus elsewher hi
eyebrow were veri massiv almost meet over the nose and with bushi
hair that seem to curl in it own profus the mouth so far as i
could see it under the heavi moustach wa fix and rather
cruellook with peculiarli sharp white teeth these protrud over
the lip whose remark ruddi show astonish vital in a
man of hi year for the rest hi ear were pale and at the top
extrem point the chin wa broad and strong and the cheek firm
though thin the gener effect wa on of extraordinari pallor
hitherto i had notic the back of hi hand as thei lai on hi knee
in the firelight and thei had seem rather white and fine but see
them now close to me i could not but notic that thei were rather
coarsebroad with squat finger strang to sai there were hair in
the centr of the palm the nail were long and fine and cut to a sharp
point as the count lean over me and hi hand touch me i could not
repress a shudder it mai have been that hi breath wa rank but a
horribl feel of nausea came over me which do what i would i could
not conceal the count evid notic it drew back and with a
grim sort of smile which show more than he had yet done hi
protuber teeth sat himself down again on hi own side of the
fireplac we were both silent for a while and as i look toward the
window i saw the first dim streak of the come dawn there seem a
strang still over everyth but as i listen i heard as if from
down below in the vallei the howl of mani wolv the count ey
gleam and he said
listen to themth children of the night what music thei make
see i suppos some express in my face strang to him he
ad
ah sir you dweller in the citi cannot enter into the feel of the
hunter then he rose and said
but you must be tire your bedroom is all readi and tomorrow you
shall sleep as late as you will i have to be awai till the afternoon
so sleep well and dream well with a courteou bow he open for me
himself the door to the octagon room and i enter my bedroom
i am all in a sea of wonder i doubt i fear i think strang thing
which i dare not confess to my own soul god keep me if onli for the
sake of those dear to me
7 mayit is again earli morn but i have rest and enjoi the
last twentyfour hour i slept till late in the dai and awok of my
own accord when i had dress myself i went into the room where we had

the curtain and upholsteri of the chair and sofa and the hang of
my bed ar of the costliest and most beauti fabric and must have
been of fabul valu when thei were made for thei ar centuri old
though in excel order i saw someth like them in hampton court
but there thei were worn and frai and motheaten but still in none of
the room is there a mirror there is not even a toilet glass on my
tabl and i had to get the littl shave glass from my bag befor i
could either shave or brush my hair i have not yet seen a servant
anywher or heard a sound near the castl except the howl of wolv
some time after i had finish my meali do not know whether to call it

iti look about for someth to read for i did not like to go about
the castl until i had ask the count permiss there wa

to you my friend i look that i know it to speak

i thank you my friend for your all tooflatt estim but yet i
fear that i am but a littl wai on the road i would travel true i know
the grammar and the word but yet i know not how to speak them
inde i said you speak excel
not so he answer well i know that did i move and speak in your
london none there ar who would not know me for a stranger that is not
enough for me here i am nobl i am boyar the common peopl know me
and i am master but a stranger in a strang land he is no on men
know him notand to know not is to care not for i am content if i am
like the rest so that no man stop if he see me or paus in hi
speak if he hear my word ha ha a stranger i have been so long
master that i would be master stillor at least that none other should
be master of me you come to me not alon as agent of my friend peter
hawkin of exet to tell me all about my new estat in london you

learn the english inton and i would that you tell me when i make
error even of the smallest in my speak i am sorri that i had to be

import affair in hand
of cours i said all i could about be will and ask if i might
come into that room when i chose he answer ye certainli and
ad
you mai go anywher you wish in the castl except where the door ar
lock where of cours you will not wish to go there is reason that
all thing ar as thei ar and did you see with my ey and know with
my knowledg you would perhap better understand i said i wa sure of
thi and then he went on
we ar in transylvania and transylvania is not england our wai ar
not your wai and there shall be to you mani strang thing nai from

what strang thing there mai be
thi led to much convers and as it wa evid that he want to
talk if onli for talk sake i ask him mani question regard
thing that had alreadi happen to me or come within my notic
sometim he sheer off the subject or turn the convers by
pretend not to understand but gener he answer all i ask most
frankli then as time went on and i had got somewhat bolder i ask
him of some of the strang thing of the preced night as for
instanc why the coachman went to the place where he had seen the blue
flame he then explain to me that it wa commonli believ that on a
certain night of the yearlast night in fact when all evil spirit
ar suppos to have uncheck swaya blue flame is seen over ani place
where treasur ha been conceal that treasur ha been hidden he
went on in the region through which you came last night there can be
but littl doubt for it wa the ground fought over for centuri by the
wallachian the saxon and the turk why there is hardli a foot of soil
in all thi region that ha not been enrich by the blood of men
patriot or invad in old dai there were stir time when the
austrian and the hungarian came up in hord and the patriot went out
to meet themmen and women the ag and the children tooand wait
their come on the rock abov the pass that thei might sweep
destruct on them with their artifici avalanch when the invad
wa triumphant he found but littl for whatev there wa had been
shelter in the friendli soil
but how said i can it have remain so long undiscov when
there is a sure index to it if men will but take the troubl to look
the count smile and as hi lip ran back over hi gum the long
sharp canin teeth show out strang he answer
becaus your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool those flame onli
appear on on night and on that night no man of thi land will if he
can help it stir without hi door and dear sir even if he did he
would not know what to do why even the peasant that you tell me of who
mark the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight
even for hi own work even you would not i dare be sworn be abl to
find these place again
there you ar right i said i know no more than the dead where even
to look for them then we drift into other matter
come he said at last tell me of london and of the hous which you
have procur for me with an apolog for my remiss i went into my
own room to get the paper from my bag whilst i wa place them in
order i heard a rattl of china and silver in the next room and as i
pass through notic that the tabl had been clear and the lamp
lit for it wa by thi time deep into the dark the lamp were also lit
in the studi or librari and i found the count ly on the sofa
read of all thing in the world an english bradshaw guid when i
came in he clear the book and paper from the tabl and with him i
went into plan and deed and figur of all sort he wa interest in
everyth and ask me a myriad question about the place and it
surround he clearli had studi beforehand all he could get on the
subject of the neighbourhood for he evid at the end knew veri much
more than i did when i remark thi he answer
well but my friend is it not need that i should when i go there
i shall be all alon and my friend harker jonathannai pardon me i
fall into my countri habit of put your patronym firstmi friend
jonathan harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me he will be
in exet mile awai probabl work at paper of the law with my
other friend peter hawkin so
we went thoroughli into the busi of the purchas of the estat at
purfleet when i had told him the fact and got hi signatur to the
necessari paper and had written a letter with them readi to post to
mr hawkin he began to ask me how i had come across so suitabl a
place i read to him the note which i had made at the time and which i
inscrib here
at purfleet on a byroad i came across just such a place as seem to
be requir and where wa displai a dilapid notic that the place
wa for sale it is surround by a high wall of ancient structur
built of heavi stone and ha not been repair for a larg number of
year the close gate ar of heavi old oak and iron all eaten with
rust
the estat is call carfax no doubt a corrupt of the old quatr
face as the hous is foursid agre with the cardin point of
the compass it contain in all some twenti acr quit surround by
the solid stone wall abov mention there ar mani tree on it which
make it in place gloomi and there is a deep darklook pond or
small lake evid fed by some spring as the water is clear and
flow awai in a fairsiz stream the hous is veri larg and of all
period back i should sai to mediv time for on part is of stone
immens thick with onli a few window high up and heavili bar with
iron it look like part of a keep and is close to an old chapel or
church i could not enter it as i had not the kei of the door lead
to it from the hous but i have taken with my kodak view of it from
variou point the hous ha been ad to but in a veri straggl
wai and i can onli guess at the amount of ground it cover which must
be veri great there ar but few hous close at hand on be a veri
larg hous onli recent ad to and form into a privat lunat
asylum it is not howev visibl from the ground
when i had finish he said
i am glad that it is old and big i myself am of an old famili and to
live in a new hous would kill me a hous cannot be made habit in a
dai and after all how few dai go to make up a centuri i rejoic
also that there is a chapel of old time we transylvanian nobl love
not to think that our bone mai lie amongst the common dead i seek not
gaieti nor mirth not the bright voluptu of much sunshin and
sparkl water which pleas the young and gai i am no longer young
and my heart through weari year of mourn over the dead is not
attun to mirth moreov the wall of my castl ar broken the
shadow ar mani and the wind breath cold through the broken
battlement and casement i love the shade and the shadow and would
be alon with my thought when i mai somehow hi word and hi look
did not seem to accord or els it wa that hi cast of face made hi
smile look malign and saturnin
present with an excus he left me ask me to put all my paper
togeth he wa some littl time awai and i began to look at some of
the book around me on wa an atla which i found open natur at
england as if that map had been much us on look at it i found in
certain place littl ring mark and on examin these i notic
that on wa near london on the east side manifestli where hi new
estat wa situat the other two were exet and whitbi on the
yorkshir coast
it wa the better part of an hour when the count return aha he
said still at your book good but you must not work alwai come i
am inform that your supper is readi he took my arm and we went into
the next room where i found an excel supper readi on the tabl the
count again excus himself as he had dine out on hi be awai from
home but he sat as on the previou night and chat whilst i at
after supper i smoke as on the last even and the count stai with
me chat and ask question on everi conceiv subject hour
after hour i felt that it wa get veri late inde but i did not
sai anyth for i felt under oblig to meet my host wish in
everi wai i wa not sleepi as the long sleep yesterdai had fortifi
me but i could not help experienc that chill which come over on at
the come of the dawn which is like in it wai the turn of the tide
thei sai that peopl who ar near death die gener at the chang to
the dawn or at the turn of the tide ani on who ha when tire and
ti as it were to hi post experienc thi chang in the atmospher
can well believ it all at onc we heard the crow of a cock come up
with preternatur shrill through the clear morn air count
dracula jump to hi feet said
why there is the morn again how remiss i am to let you stai up so
long you must make your convers regard my dear new countri of
england less interest so that i mai not forget how time fli by
us and with a courtli bow he quickli left me
i went into my own room and drew the curtain but there wa littl to
notic my window open into the courtyard all i could see wa the
warm grei of quicken sky so i pull the curtain again and have
written of thi dai
8 mayi began to fear as i wrote in thi book that i wa get too
diffus but now i am glad that i went into detail from the first for
there is someth so strang about thi place and all in it that i
cannot but feel uneasi i wish i were safe out of it or that i had
never come it mai be that thi strang nightexist is tell on
me but would that that were all if there were ani on to talk to i
could bear it but there is no on i have onli the count to speak with
and hei fear i am myself the onli live soul within the place let
me be prosaic so far as fact can be it will help me to bear up and
imagin must not run riot with me if it doe i am lost let me sai
at onc how i standor seem to
i onli slept a few hour when i went to bed and feel that i could
not sleep ani more got up i had hung my shave glass by the window
and wa just begin to shave suddenli i felt a hand on my shoulder
and heard the count voic sai to me goodmorn i start for
it amaz me that i had not seen him sinc the reflect of the glass
cover the whole room behind me in start i had cut myself slightli
but did not notic it at the moment have answer the count
salut i turn to the glass again to see how i had been mistaken
thi time there could be no error for the man wa close to me and i
could see him over my shoulder but there wa no reflect of him in
the mirror the whole room behind me wa displai but there wa no
sign of a man in it except myself thi wa startl and come on
the top of so mani strang thing wa begin to increas that vagu
feel of uneasi which i alwai have when the count is near but at
the instant i saw that the cut had bled a littl and the blood wa
trickl over my chin i laid down the razor turn as i did so half
round to look for some stick plaster when the count saw my face hi
ey blaze with a sort of demoniac furi and he suddenli made a grab at
my throat i drew awai and hi hand touch the string of bead which
held the crucifix it made an instant chang in him for the furi pass
so quickli that i could hardli believ that it wa ever there
take care he said take care how you cut yourself it is more
danger than you think in thi countri then seiz the shave
glass he went on and thi is the wretch thing that ha done the
mischief it is a foul baubl of man vaniti awai with it and
open the heavi window with on wrench of hi terribl hand he flung
out the glass which wa shatter into a thousand piec on the stone
of the courtyard far below then he withdrew without a word it is veri
annoi for i do not see how i am to shave unless in my watchcas or
the bottom of the shavingpot which is fortun of metal
when i went into the diningroom breakfast wa prepar but i could
not find the count anywher so i breakfast alon it is strang that
as yet i have not seen the count eat or drink he must be a veri
peculiar man after breakfast i did a littl explor in the castl i
went out on the stair and found a room look toward the south the
view wa magnific and from where i stood there wa everi opportun
of see it the castl is on the veri edg of a terribl precipic a
stone fall from the window would fall a thousand feet without
touch anyth as far as the ey can reach is a sea of green tree
top with occasion a deep rift where there is a chasm here and
there ar silver thread where the river wind in deep gorg through
the forest
but i am not in heart to describ beauti for when i had seen the view i
explor further door door door everywher and all lock and
bolt in no place save from the window in the castl wall is there
an avail exit
the castl is a verit prison and i am a prison
chapter iii
jonathan harker journalcontinu
when i found that i wa a prison a sort of wild feel came over me
i rush up and down the stair try everi door and peer out of
everi window i could find but after a littl the convict of my
helpless overpow all other feel when i look back after a
few hour i think i must have been mad for the time for i behav much
as a rat doe in a trap when howev the convict had come to me
that i wa helpless i sat down quietlya quietli as i have ever done
anyth in my lifeand began to think over what wa best to be done i
am think still and as yet have come to no definit conclus of
on thing onli am i certain that it is no us make my idea known to
the count he know well that i am imprison and as he ha done it
himself and ha doubtless hi own motiv for it he would onli deceiv
me if i trust him fulli with the fact so far as i can see my onli
plan will be to keep my knowledg and my fear to myself and my ey
open i am i know either be deceiv like a babi by my own fear
or els i am in desper strait and if the latter be so i need and
shall need all my brain to get through
i had hardli come to thi conclus when i heard the great door below
shut and knew that the count had return he did not come at onc into
the librari so i went cautious to my own room and found him make
the bed thi wa odd but onli confirm what i had all along
thoughtthat there were no servant in the hous when later i saw him
through the chink of the hing of the door lai the tabl in the
diningroom i wa assur of it for if he doe himself all these
menial offic sure it is proof that there is no on els to do them
thi gave me a fright for if there is no on els in the castl it
must have been the count himself who wa the driver of the coach that
brought me here thi is a terribl thought for if so what doe it
mean that he could control the wolv as he did by onli hold up hi
hand in silenc how wa it that all the peopl at bistritz and on the
coach had some terribl fear for me what meant the give of the
crucifix of the garlic of the wild rose of the mountain ash bless
that good good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck for it is a
comfort and a strength to me whenev i touch it it is odd that a thing
which i have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatr
should in a time of loneli and troubl be of help is it that there
is someth in the essenc of the thing itself or that it is a medium
a tangibl help in convei memori of sympathi and comfort some
time if it mai be i must examin thi matter and try to make up my
mind about it in the meantim i must find out all i can about count
dracula as it mai help me to understand tonight he mai talk of
himself if i turn the convers that wai i must be veri care
howev not to awak hi suspicion
midnighti have had a long talk with the count i ask him a few
question on transylvania histori and he warm up to the subject
wonderfulli in hi speak of thing and peopl and especi of
battl he spoke as if he had been present at them all thi he
afterward explain by sai that to a boyar the pride of hi hous
and name is hi own pride that their glori is hi glori that their
fate is hi fate whenev he spoke of hi hous he alwai said we
and spoke almost in the plural like a king speak i wish i could put
down all he said exactli as he said it for to me it wa most
fascin it seem to have in it a whole histori of the countri he
grew excit as he spoke and walk about the room pull hi great
white moustach and grasp anyth on which he laid hi hand as
though he would crush it by main strength on thing he said which i
shall put down as nearli as i can for it tell in it wai the stori of
hi race
we szeke have a right to be proud for in our vein flow the blood
of mani brave race who fought as the lion fight for lordship here
in the whirlpool of european race the ugric tribe bore down from
iceland the fight spirit which thor and wodin gave them which their
berserk displai to such fell intent on the seaboard of europ ay
and of asia and africa too till the peopl thought that the
werewolv themselv had come here too when thei came thei found
the hun whose warlik furi had swept the earth like a live flame
till the dy peopl held that in their vein ran the blood of those
old witch who expel from scythia had mate with the devil in the
desert fool fool what devil or what witch wa ever so great as
attila whose blood is in these vein he held up hi arm is it a
wonder that we were a conquer race that we were proud that when the
magyar the lombard the avar the bulgar or the turk pour hi
thousand on our frontier we drove them back is it strang that when
arpad and hi legion swept through the hungarian fatherland he found us
here when he reach the frontier that the honfoglala wa complet
there and when the hungarian flood swept eastward the szeke were
claim as kindr by the victori magyar and to us for centuri
wa trust the guard of the frontier of turkeyland ay and more
than that endless duti of the frontier guard for as the turk sai
water sleep and enemi is sleepless who more gladli than we
throughout the four nation receiv the bloodi sword or at it
warlik call flock quicker to the standard of the king when wa
redeem that great shame of my nation the shame of cassova when the
flag of the wallach and the magyar went down beneath the crescent who
wa it but on of my own race who as voivod cross the danub and beat
the turk on hi own ground thi wa a dracula inde woe wa it that
hi own unworthi brother when he had fallen sold hi peopl to the
turk and brought the shame of slaveri on them wa it not thi dracula
inde who inspir that other of hi race who in a later ag again and
again brought hi forc over the great river into turkeyland who
when he wa beaten back came again and again and again though he had
to come alon from the bloodi field where hi troop were be
slaughter sinc he knew that he alon could ultim triumph thei
said that he thought onli of himself bah what good ar peasant
without a leader where end the war without a brain and heart to
conduct it again when after the battl of mohc we threw off the
hungarian yoke we of the dracula blood were amongst their leader for
our spirit would not brook that we were not free ah young sir the
szekelysand the dracula as their heart blood their brain and
their swordscan boast a record that mushroom growth like the
hapsburg and the romanoff can never reach the warlik dai ar over
blood is too preciou a thing in these dai of dishonour peac and
the glori of the great race ar as a tale that is told
it wa by thi time close on morn and we went to bed mem thi
diari seem horribl like the begin of the arabian night for
everyth ha to break off at cockcrowor like the ghost of hamlet

12 maylet me begin with factsbar meagr fact verifi by
book and figur and of which there can be no doubt i must not
confus them with experi which will have to rest on my own
observ or my memori of them last even when the count came from
hi room he began by ask me question on legal matter and on the
do of certain kind of busi i had spent the dai wearili over
book and simpli to keep my mind occupi went over some of the
matter i had been examin at lincoln inn there wa a certain
method in the count inquiri so i shall try to put them down in
sequenc the knowledg mai somehow or some time be us to me
first he ask if a man in england might have two solicitor or more i
told him he might have a dozen if he wish but that it would not be
wise to have more than on solicitor engag in on transact as onli
on could act at a time and that to chang would be certain to milit
against hi interest he seem thoroughli to understand and went on to
ask if there would be ani practic difficulti in have on man to
attend sai to bank and anoth to look after ship in case
local help were need in a place far from the home of the bank
solicitor i ask him to explain more fulli so that i might not by ani
chanc mislead him so he said
i shall illustr your friend and mine mr peter hawkin from under
the shadow of your beauti cathedr at exet which is far from
london bui for me through your good self my place at london good now
here let me sai frankli lest you should think it strang that i have
sought the servic of on so far off from london instead of some on
resid there that my motiv wa that no local interest might be
serv save my wish onli and as on of london resid might perhap
have some purpos of himself or friend to serv i went thu afield to
seek my agent whose labour should be onli to my interest now suppos
i who have much of affair wish to ship good sai to newcastl or
durham or harwich or dover might it not be that it could with more
eas be done by consign to on in these port i answer that
certainli it would be most easi but that we solicitor had a system of
agenc on for the other so that local work could be done local on
instruct from ani solicitor so that the client simpli place
himself in the hand of on man could have hi wish carri out by
him without further troubl
but said he i could be at liberti to direct myself is it not so
of cours i repli and such is often done by men of busi who
do not like the whole of their affair to be known by ani on person
good he said and then went on to ask about the mean of make
consign and the form to be gone through and of all sort of
difficulti which might aris but by forethought could be guard
against i explain all these thing to him to the best of my abil
and he certainli left me under the impress that he would have made a
wonder solicitor for there wa noth that he did not think of or
forese for a man who wa never in the countri and who did not
evid do much in the wai of busi hi knowledg and acumen were
wonder when he had satisfi himself on these point of which he had
spoken and i had verifi all as well as i could by the book
avail he suddenli stood up and said
have you written sinc your first letter to our friend mr peter
hawkin or to ani other it wa with some bitter in my heart that
i answer that i had not that as yet i had not seen ani opportun of
send letter to anybodi
then write now my young friend he said lai a heavi hand on my
shoulder write to our friend and to ani other and sai if it will
pleas you that you shall stai with me until a month from now
do you wish me to stai so long i ask for my heart grew cold at the
thought
i desir it much nai i will take no refus when your master
employ what you will engag that someon should come on hi behalf
it wa understood that my need onli were to be consult i have not
stint is it not so
what could i do but bow accept it wa mr hawkinss interest not
mine and i had to think of him not myself and besid while count
dracula wa speak there wa that in hi ey and in hi bear
which made me rememb that i wa a prison and that if i wish it i
could have no choic the count saw hi victori in my bow and hi
masteri in the troubl of my face for he began at onc to us them but
in hi own smooth resistless wai
i prai you my good young friend that you will not discours of thing
other than busi in your letter it will doubtless pleas your
friend to know that you ar well and that you look forward to get
home to them is it not so as he spoke he hand me three sheet of
notepap and three envelop thei were all of the thinnest foreign
post and look at them then at him and notic hi quiet smile
with the sharp canin teeth ly over the red underlip i understood
as well as if he had spoken that i should be care what i wrote for
he would be abl to read it so i determin to write onli formal note
now but to write fulli to mr hawkin in secret and also to mina for
to her i could write in shorthand which would puzzl the count if he
did see it when i had written my two letter i sat quiet read a
book whilst the count wrote sever note refer as he wrote them to
some book on hi tabl then he took up my two and place them with hi
own and put by hi write materi after which the instant the door
had close behind him i lean over and look at the letter which
were face down on the tabl i felt no compunct in do so for
under the circumst i felt that i should protect myself in everi wai
i could
on of the letter wa direct to samuel f billington no 7 the
crescent whitbi anoth to herr leutner varna the third wa to
coutt co london and the fourth to herren klopstock billreuth
banker budapesth the second and fourth were unseal i wa just
about to look at them when i saw the doorhandl move i sank back in my
seat have just had time to replac the letter as thei had been and
to resum my book befor the count hold still anoth letter in hi
hand enter the room he took up the letter on the tabl and stamp
them carefulli and then turn to me said
i trust you will forgiv me but i have much work to do in privat thi
even you will i hope find all thing as you wish at the door he
turn and after a moment paus said
let me advis you my dear young friendnai let me warn you with all
serious that should you leav these room you will not by ani
chanc go to sleep in ani other part of the castl it is old and ha
mani memori and there ar bad dream for those who sleep unwis be
warn should sleep now or ever overcom you or be like to do then
hast to your own chamber or to these room for your rest will then be
safe but if you be not care in thi respect thenh finish hi
speech in a gruesom wai for he motion with hi hand as if he were
wash them i quit understood my onli doubt wa as to whether ani
dream could be more terribl than the unnatur horribl net of gloom
and mysteri which seem close around me
lateri endors the last word written but thi time there is no
doubt in question i shall not fear to sleep in ani place where he is
not i have place the crucifix over the head of my bedi imagin that
my rest is thu freer from dream and there it shall remain
when he left me i went to my room after a littl while not hear ani
sound i came out and went up the stone stair to where i could look out
toward the south there wa some sens of freedom in the vast expans
inaccess though it wa to me as compar with the narrow dark
of the courtyard look out on thi i felt that i wa inde in
prison and i seem to want a breath of fresh air though it were of
the night i am begin to feel thi nocturn exist tell on me
it is destroi my nerv i start at my own shadow and am full of all
sort of horribl imagin god know that there is ground for my
terribl fear in thi accurs place i look out over the beauti
expans bath in soft yellow moonlight till it wa almost as light as
dai in the soft light the distant hill becam melt and the shadow
in the vallei and gorg of velveti black the mere beauti seem
to cheer me there wa peac and comfort in everi breath i drew as i
lean from the window my ey wa caught by someth move a storei
below me and somewhat to my left where i imagin from the order of
the room that the window of the count own room would look out the
window at which i stood wa tall and deep stonemullion and though
weatherworn wa still complet but it wa evid mani a dai sinc
the case had been there i drew back behind the stonework and look
carefulli out
what i saw wa the count head come out from the window i did not
see the face but i knew the man by the neck and the movement of hi
back and arm in ani case i could not mistak the hand which i had had
so mani opportun of studi i wa at first interest and
somewhat amus for it is wonder how small a matter will interest
and amus a man when he is a prison but my veri feel chang to
repuls and terror when i saw the whole man slowli emerg from the
window and begin to crawl down the castl wall over that dread abyss
face down with hi cloak spread out around him like great wing at
first i could not believ my ey i thought it wa some trick of the
moonlight some weird effect of shadow but i kept look and it could
be no delus i saw the finger and toe grasp the corner of the
stone worn clear of the mortar by the stress of year and by thu
us everi project and inequ move downward with consider
speed just as a lizard move along a wall
what manner of man is thi or what manner of creatur is it in the
semblanc of man i feel the dread of thi horribl place overpow
me i am in fearin aw fearand there is no escap for me i am
encompass about with terror that i dare not think of
15 mayonc more have i seen the count go out in hi lizard fashion
he move downward in a sidelong wai some hundr feet down and a good
deal to the left he vanish into some hole or window when hi head
had disappear i lean out to try and see more but without
availth distanc wa too great to allow a proper angl of sight i
knew he had left the castl now and thought to us the opportun to
explor more than i had dare to do as yet i went back to the room and
take a lamp tri all the door thei were all lock as i had
expect and the lock were compar new but i went down the
stone stair to the hall where i had enter origin i found i could
pull back the bolt easili enough and unhook the great chain but the
door wa lock and the kei wa gone that kei must be in the count
room i must watch should hi door be unlock so that i mai get it and
escap i went on to make a thorough examin of the variou stair
and passag and to try the door that open from them on or two
small room near the hall were open but there wa noth to see in
them except old furnitur dusti with ag and motheaten at last
howev i found on door at the top of the stairwai which though it
seem to be lock gave a littl under pressur i tri it harder
and found that it wa not realli lock but that the resist came
from the fact that the hing had fallen somewhat and the heavi door
rest on the floor here wa an opportun which i might not have
again so i exert myself and with mani effort forc it back so that
i could enter i wa now in a wing of the castl further to the right
than the room i knew and a storei lower down from the window i could
see that the suit of room lai along to the south of the castl the
window of the end room look out both west and south on the latter
side as well as to the former there wa a great precipic the castl
wa built on the corner of a great rock so that on three side it wa
quit impregn and great window were place here where sling or
bow or culverin could not reach and consequ light and comfort
imposs to a posit which had to be guard were secur to the
west wa a great vallei and then rise far awai great jag
mountain fast rise peak on peak the sheer rock stud with
mountain ash and thorn whose root clung in crack and crevic and
cranni of the stone thi wa evid the portion of the castl
occupi by the ladi in bygon dai for the furnitur had more air of
comfort than ani i had seen the window were curtainless and the
yellow moonlight flood in through the diamond pane enabl on to
see even colour whilst it soften the wealth of dust which lai over
all and disguis in some measur the ravag of time and the moth my
lamp seem to be of littl effect in the brilliant moonlight but i wa
glad to have it with me for there wa a dread loneli in the place
which chill my heart and made my nerv trembl still it wa better
than live alon in the room which i had come to hate from the
presenc of the count and after try a littl to school my nerv i
found a soft quietud come over me here i am sit at a littl oak
tabl where in old time possibl some fair ladi sat to pen with much
thought and mani blush her illspelt lovelett and write in my
diari in shorthand all that ha happen sinc i close it last it is
nineteenth centuri uptod with a vengeanc and yet unless my
sens deceiv me the old centuri had and have power of their own
which mere modern cannot kill
later the morn of 16 maygod preserv my saniti for to thi i
am reduc safeti and the assur of safeti ar thing of the past
whilst i live on here there is but on thing to hope for that i mai not
go mad if inde i be not mad alreadi if i be sane then sure it
is madden to think that of all the foul thing that lurk in thi
hate place the count is the least dread to me that to him alon i
can look for safeti even though thi be onli whilst i can serv hi
purpos great god merci god let me be calm for out of that wai
li mad inde i begin to get new light on certain thing which
have puzzl me up to now i never quit knew what shakespear meant
when he made hamlet sai
my tablet quick my tablet
ti meet that i put it down etc
for now feel as though my own brain were unhing or as if the shock
had come which must end in it undo i turn to my diari for repos
the habit of enter accur must help to sooth me
the count mysteri warn frighten me at the time it frighten
me more now when i think of it for in futur he ha a fear hold upon
me i shall fear to doubt what he mai sai
when i had written in my diari and had fortun replac the book and
pen in my pocket i felt sleepi the count warn came into my mind
but i took a pleasur in disobei it the sens of sleep wa upon me
and with it the obstinaci which sleep bring as outrid the soft
moonlight sooth and the wide expans without gave a sens of freedom
which refresh me i determin not to return tonight to the
gloomhaunt room but to sleep here where of old ladi had sat
and sung and live sweet live whilst their gentl breast were sad for
their menfolk awai in the midst of remorseless war i drew a great
couch out of it place near the corner so that as i lai i could look
at the love view to east and south and unthink of and uncar for
the dust compos myself for sleep i suppos i must have fallen
asleep i hope so but i fear for all that follow wa startlingli
realso real that now sit here in the broad full sunlight of the
morn i cannot in the least believ that it wa all sleep
i wa not alon the room wa the same unchang in ani wai sinc i
came into it i could see along the floor in the brilliant moonlight
my own footstep mark where i had disturb the long accumul of
dust in the moonlight opposit me were three young women ladi by
their dress and manner i thought at the time that i must be dream
when i saw them for though the moonlight wa behind them thei threw
no shadow on the floor thei came close to me and look at me for some
time and then whisper togeth two were dark and had high aquilin
nose like the count and great dark pierc ey that seem to be
almost red when contrast with the pale yellow moon the other wa
fair as fair as can be with great wavi mass of golden hair and ey
like pale sapphir i seem somehow to know her face and to know it
in connect with some dreami fear but i could not recollect at the
moment how or where all three had brilliant white teeth that shone like
pearl against the rubi of their voluptu lip there wa someth
about them that made me uneasi some long and at the same time some
deadli fear i felt in my heart a wick burn desir that thei would
kiss me with those red lip it is not good to note thi down lest some
dai it should meet mina ey and caus her pain but it is the truth
thei whisper togeth and then thei all three laughedsuch a
silveri music laugh but as hard as though the sound never could have
come through the soft of human lip it wa like the intoler
tingl sweet of waterglass when plai on by a cun hand
the fair girl shook her head coquettishli and the other two urg her
on on said
go on you ar first and we shall follow your is the right to
begin the other ad
he is young and strong there ar kiss for us all i lai quiet
look out under my eyelash in an agoni of delight anticip
the fair girl advanc and bent over me till i could feel the movement
of her breath upon me sweet it wa in on sens honeysweet and sent
the same tingl through the nerv as her voic but with a bitter
underli the sweet a bitter offens as on smell in blood
i wa afraid to rais my eyelid but look out and saw perfectli under
the lash the girl went on her knee and bent over me simpli
gloat there wa a deliber voluptu which wa both thrill
and repuls and as she arch her neck she actual lick her lip
like an anim till i could see in the moonlight the moistur shine
on the scarlet lip and on the red tongu as it lap the white sharp
teeth lower and lower went her head as the lip went below the rang of
my mouth and chin and seem about to fasten on my throat then she
paus and i could hear the churn sound of her tongu as it lick
her teeth and lip and could feel the hot breath on my neck then the
skin of my throat began to tingl as on flesh doe when the hand that
is to tickl it approach nearernear i could feel the soft
shiver touch of the lip on the supersensit skin of my throat
and the hard dent of two sharp teeth just touch and paus there
i close my ey in a languor ecstasi and waitedwait with beat
heart
but at that instant anoth sensat swept through me as quick as
lightn i wa consciou of the presenc of the count and of hi
be as if lap in a storm of furi as my ey open involuntarili i
saw hi strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with
giant power draw it back the blue ey transform with furi the
white teeth champ with rage and the fair cheek blaze red with
passion but the count never did i imagin such wrath and furi even to
the demon of the pit hi ey were posit blaze the red light
in them wa lurid as if the flame of hellfir blaze behind them hi
face wa deathli pale and the line of it were hard like drawn wire
the thick eyebrow that met over the nose now seem like a heav bar
of whitehot metal with a fierc sweep of hi arm he hurl the woman
from him and then motion to the other as though he were beat
them back it wa the same imperi gestur that i had seen us to the
wolv in a voic which though low and almost in a whisper seem to
cut through the air and then ring round the room he said
how dare you touch him ani of you how dare you cast ey on him when
i had forbidden it back i tell you all thi man belong to me bewar
how you meddl with him or youll have to deal with me the fair girl
with a laugh of ribald coquetri turn to answer him
you yourself never love you never love on thi the other women
join and such a mirthless hard soulless laughter rang through the
room that it almost made me faint to hear it seem like the pleasur
of fiend then the count turn after look at my face attent
and said in a soft whisper
ye i too can love you yourselv can tell it from the past is it
not so well now i promis you that when i am done with him you shall
kiss him at your will now go go i must awaken him for there is work
to be done
ar we to have noth tonight said on of them with a low laugh
as she point to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor and which
move as though there were some live thing within it for answer he
nod hi head on of the women jump forward and open it if my
ear did not deceiv me there wa a gasp and a low wail as of a
halfsmoth child the women close round whilst i wa aghast with
horror but as i look thei disappear and with them the dread
bag there wa no door near them and thei could not have pass me
without my notic thei simpli seem to fade into the rai of the
moonlight and pass out through the window for i could see outsid the
dim shadowi form for a moment befor thei entir fade awai
then the horror overcam me and i sank down unconsci
chapter iv
jonathan harker journalcontinu
i awok in my own bed if it be that i had not dreamt the count must
have carri me here i tri to satisfi myself on the subject but
could not arriv at ani unquestion result to be sure there were
certain small evid such as that my cloth were fold and laid by
in a manner which wa not my habit my watch wa still unwound and i am
rigor accustom to wind it the last thing befor go to bed and
mani such detail but these thing ar no proof for thei mai have been
evid that my mind wa not as usual and from some caus or
anoth i had certainli been much upset i must watch for proof of on
thing i am glad if it wa that the count carri me here and undress
me he must have been hurri in hi task for my pocket ar intact i
am sure thi diari would have been a mysteri to him which he would not
have brook he would have taken or destroi it as i look round thi
room although it ha been to me so full of fear it is now a sort of
sanctuari for noth can be more dread than those aw women who
werewho arewait to suck my blood
18 mayi have been down to look at that room again in daylight for
i must know the truth when i got to the doorwai at the top of the
stair i found it close it had been so forcibl driven against the
jamb that part of the woodwork wa splinter i could see that the bolt
of the lock had not been shot but the door is fasten from the insid
i fear it wa no dream and must act on thi surmis
19 mayi am sure in the toil last night the count ask me in
the suavest tone to write three letter on sai that my work here
wa nearli done and that i should start for home within a few dai
anoth that i wa start on the next morn from the time of the
letter and the third that i had left the castl and arriv at
bistritz i would fain have rebel but felt that in the present state
of thing it would be mad to quarrel openli with the count whilst i
am so absolut in hi power and to refus would be to excit hi
suspicion and to arous hi anger he know that i know too much and
that i must not live lest i be danger to him my onli chanc is to
prolong my opportun someth mai occur which will give me a
chanc to escap i saw in hi ey someth of that gather wrath
which wa manifest when he hurl that fair woman from him he explain
to me that post were few and uncertain and that my write now would
ensur eas of mind to my friend and he assur me with so much
impress that he would countermand the later letter which would
be held over at bistritz until due time in case chanc would admit of my
prolong my stai that to oppos him would have been to creat new
suspicion i therefor pretend to fall in with hi view and ask
him what date i should put on the letter he calcul a minut and
then said
the first should be june 12 the second june 19 and the third june
29
i know now the span of my life god help me

hawkin to commun with her to her i have explain my situat
but without the horror which i mai onli surmis it would shock and
frighten her to death were i to expos my heart to her should the

with a gold piec and made what sign i could to have them post the

31 maythi morn when i woke i thought i would provid myself
with some paper and envelop from my bag and keep them in my pocket so
that i might write in case i should get an opportun but again a
surpris again a shock
everi scrap of paper wa gone and with it all my note my memoranda
relat to railwai and travel my letter of credit in fact all that
might be us to me were i onc outsid the castl i sat and ponder
awhil and then some thought occur to me and i made search of my
portmanteau and in the wardrob where i had place my cloth
the suit in which i had travel wa gone and also my overcoat and
rug i could find no trace of them anywher thi look like some new
scheme of villaini
17 junethi morn as i wa sit on the edg of my bed
cudgel my brain i heard without a crack of whip and pound
and scrape of hors feet up the rocki path beyond the courtyard
with joi i hurri to the window and saw drive into the yard two great
leiterwagon each drawn by eight sturdi hors and at the head of
each pair a slovak with hi wide hat great nailstud belt dirti
sheepskin and high boot thei had also their long stave in hand i
ran to the door intend to descend and try and join them through the
main hall as i thought that wai might be open for them again a
shock my door wa fasten on the outsid
then i ran to the window and cri to them thei look up at me
stupidli and point but just then the hetman of the szgani came out
and see them point to my window said someth at which thei
laugh henceforth no effort of mine no piteou cry or agonis
entreati would make them even look at me thei resolut turn awai
the leiterwagon contain great squar box with handl of thick
rope these were evid empti by the eas with which the slovak
handl them and by their reson as thei were roughli move when
thei were all unload and pack in a great heap in on corner of the
yard the slovak were given some monei by the szgani and spit on
it for luck lazili went each to hi hors head shortli afterward i
heard the crack of their whip die awai in the distanc
24 june befor morninglast night the count left me earli and
lock himself into hi own room as soon as i dare i ran up the
wind stair and look out of the window which open south i
thought i would watch for the count for there is someth go on
the szgani ar quarter somewher in the castl and ar do work of
some kind i know it for now and then i hear a farawai muffl sound
as of mattock and spade and whatev it is it must be the end of some
ruthless villaini
i had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour when i saw
someth come out of the count window i drew back and watch
carefulli and saw the whole man emerg it wa a new shock to me to
find that he had on the suit of cloth which i had worn whilst
travel here and slung over hi shoulder the terribl bag which i
had seen the women take awai there could be no doubt as to hi quest
and in my garb too thi then is hi new scheme of evil that he will
allow other to see me as thei think so that he mai both leav
evid that i have been seen in the town or villag post my own
letter and that ani wicked which he mai do shall by the local
peopl be attribut to me
it make me rage to think that thi can go on and whilst i am shut up
here a verit prison but without that protect of the law which
is even a crimin right and consol
i thought i would watch for the count return and for a long time sat
doggedli at the window then i began to notic that there were some
quaint littl speck float in the rai of the moonlight thei were
like the tiniest grain of dust and thei whirl round and gather in
cluster in a nebul sort of wai i watch them with a sens of
sooth and a sort of calm stole over me i lean back in the
embrasur in a more comfort posit so that i could enjoi more
fulli the arial gambol
someth made me start up a low piteou howl of dog somewher far
below in the vallei which wa hidden from my sight louder it seem to
ring in my ear and the float mote of dust to take new shape to
the sound as thei danc in the moonlight i felt myself struggl to
awak to some call of my instinct nai my veri soul wa struggl
and my halfrememb sensibl were strive to answer the call i
wa becom hypnotis quicker and quicker danc the dust the
moonbeam seem to quiver as thei went by me into the mass of gloom
beyond more and more thei gather till thei seem to take dim phantom
shape and then i start broad awak and in full possess of my
sens and ran scream from the place the phantom shape which were
becom gradual materialis from the moonbeam were those of the
three ghostli women to whom i wa doom i fled and felt somewhat
safer in my own room where there wa no moonlight and where the lamp
wa burn brightli
when a coupl of hour had pass i heard someth stir in the
count room someth like a sharp wail quickli suppress and then
there wa silenc deep aw silenc which chill me with a
beat heart i tri the door but i wa lock in my prison and
could do noth i sat down and simpli cri
as i sat i heard a sound in the courtyard withoutth agonis cry of a
woman i rush to the window and throw it up peer out between
the bar there inde wa a woman with dishevel hair hold her
hand over her heart as on distress with run she wa lean
against a corner of the gatewai when she saw my face at the window she
threw herself forward and shout in a voic laden with menac
monster give me my child
she threw herself on her knee and rais up her hand cri the same
word in tone which wrung my heart then she tore her hair and beat her
breast and abandon herself to all the violenc of extravag
emot final she threw herself forward and though i could not see
her i could hear the beat of her nake hand against the door
somewher high overhead probabl on the tower i heard the voic of the
count call in hi harsh metal whisper hi call seem to be
answer from far and wide by the howl of wolv befor mani minut
had pass a pack of them pour like a pentup dam when liber
through the wide entranc into the courtyard
there wa no cry from the woman and the howl of the wolv wa but
short befor long thei stream awai singli lick their lip
i could not piti her for i knew now what had becom of her child and
she wa better dead
what shall i do what can i do how can i escap from thi dread
thing of night and gloom and fear
25 june morningno man know till he ha suffer from the night
how sweet and how dear to hi heart and ey the morn can be when the
sun grew so high thi morn that it struck the top of the great
gatewai opposit my window the high spot which it touch seem to me
as if the dove from the ark had light there my fear fell from me as
if it had been a vapor garment which dissolv in the warmth i must
take action of some sort whilst the courag of the dai is upon me last
night on of my postdat letter went to post the first of that fatal
seri which is to blot out the veri trace of my exist from the
earth

count in the daylight can it be that he sleep when other wake that

same dai lateri have made the effort and god help me have
come safe back to thi room i must put down everi detail in order i
went whilst my courag wa fresh straight to the window on the south
side and at onc got outsid on the narrow ledg of stone which run
around the build on thi side the stone ar big and roughli cut
and the mortar ha by process of time been wash awai between them i
took off my boot and ventur out on the desper wai i look down
onc so as to make sure that a sudden glimps of the aw depth would
not overcom me but after that kept my ey awai from it i knew pretti
well the direct and distanc of the count window and made for it
as well as i could have regard to the opportun avail i did
not feel dizzyi suppos i wa too excitedand the time seem
ridicul short till i found myself stand on the windowsil and
try to rais up the sash i wa fill with agit howev when
i bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window then i look
around for the count but with surpris and glad made a discoveri
the room wa empti it wa bare furnish with odd thing which
seem to have never been us the furnitur wa someth the same
style as that in the south room and wa cover with dust i look
for the kei but it wa not in the lock and i could not find it
anywher the onli thing i found wa a great heap of gold in on
cornergold of all kind roman and british and austrian and
hungarian and greek and turkish monei cover with a film of dust as
though it had lain long in the ground none of it that i notic wa
less than three hundr year old there were also chain and ornament
some jewel but all of them old and stain
at on corner of the room wa a heavi door i tri it for sinc i
could not find the kei of the room or the kei of the outer door which
wa the main object of my search i must make further examin or
all my effort would be in vain it wa open and led through a stone
passag to a circular stairwai which went steepli down i descend
mind carefulli where i went for the stair were dark be onli lit
by loophol in the heavi masonri at the bottom there wa a dark
tunnellik passag through which came a deathli sickli odour the
odour of old earth newli turn as i went through the passag the smell
grew closer and heavier at last i pull open a heavi door which stood
ajar and found myself in an old ruin chapel which had evid
been us as a graveyard the roof wa broken and in two place were
step lead to vault but the ground had recent been dug over and
the earth place in great wooden box manifestli those which had been
brought by the slovak there wa nobodi about and i made search for
ani further outlet but there wa none then i went over everi inch of
the ground so as not to lose a chanc i went down even into the
vault where the dim light struggl although to do so wa a dread to
my veri soul into two of these i went but saw noth except fragment
of old coffin and pile of dust in the third howev i made a
discoveri
there in on of the great box of which there were fifti in all on a
pile of newli dug earth lai the count he wa either dead or asleep i
could not sai whichfor the ey were open and stoni but without the
glassi of deathand the cheek had the warmth of life through all
their pallor the lip were as red as ever but there wa no sign of
movement no puls no breath no beat of the heart i bent over him
and tri to find ani sign of life but in vain he could not have lain
there long for the earthi smell would have pass awai in a few hour
by the side of the box wa it cover pierc with hole here and there
i thought he might have the kei on him but when i went to search i saw
the dead ey and in them dead though thei were such a look of hate
though unconsci of me or my presenc that i fled from the place and
leav the count room by the window crawl again up the castl
wall regain my room i threw myself pant upon the bed and tri
to think
29 junetodai is the date of my last letter and the count ha
taken step to prove that it wa genuin for again i saw him leav the
castl by the same window and in my cloth as he went down the wall
lizard fashion i wish i had a gun or some lethal weapon that i might
destroi him but i fear that no weapon wrought alon by man hand would
have ani effect on him i dare not wait to see him return for i fear
to see those weird sister i came back to the librari and read there
till i fell asleep
i wa awaken by the count who look at me as grimli as a man can
look as he said

lamp preced me down the stair and along the hall suddenli he

close at hand came the howl of mani wolv it wa almost as if the
sound sprang up at the rise of hi hand just as the music of a great
orchestra seem to leap under the bton of the conductor after a paus
of a moment he proceed in hi state wai to the door drew back
the ponder bolt unhook the heavi chain and began to draw it
open
to my intens astonish i saw that it wa unlock suspici i
look all round but could see no kei of ani kind
as the door began to open the howl of the wolv without grew louder
and angrier their red jaw with champ teeth and their bluntclaw
feet as thei leap came in through the open door i knew then that
to struggl at the moment against the count wa useless with such
alli as these at hi command i could do noth but still the door
continu slowli to open and onli the count bodi stood in the gap
suddenli it struck me that thi might be the moment and mean of my
doom i wa to be given to the wolv and at my own instig there
wa a diabol wicked in the idea great enough for the count and
as a last chanc i cri out
shut the door i shall wait till morn and cover my face with my
hand to hide my tear of bitter disappoint with on sweep of hi
power arm the count threw the door shut and the great bolt clang
and echo through the hall as thei shot back into their place
in silenc we return to the librari and after a minut or two i went
to my own room the last i saw of count dracula wa hi kiss hi hand
to me with a red light of triumph in hi ey and with a smile that
juda in hell might be proud of
when i wa in my room and about to lie down i thought i heard a
whisper at my door i went to it softli and listen unless my ear
deceiv me i heard the voic of the count
back back to your own place your time is not yet come wait have
patienc tonight is mine tomorrow night is your there wa a low
sweet rippl of laughter and in a rage i threw open the door and saw
without the three terribl women lick their lip as i appear thei
all join in a horribl laugh and ran awai
i came back to my room and threw myself on my knee it is then so near
the end tomorrow tomorrow lord help me and those to whom i am
dear
30 june morningthes mai be the last word i ever write in thi
diari i slept till just befor the dawn and when i woke threw myself
on my knee for i determin that if death came he should find me
readi
at last i felt that subtl chang in the air and knew that the morn
had come then came the welcom cockcrow and i felt that i wa safe
with a glad heart i open my door and ran down to the hall i had seen
that the door wa unlock and now escap wa befor me with hand
that trembl with eager i unhook the chain and drew back the
massiv bolt
but the door would not move despair seiz me i pull and pull at
the door and shook it till massiv as it wa it rattl in it
casement i could see the bolt shot it had been lock after i left the
count
then a wild desir took me to obtain that kei at ani risk and i
determin then and there to scale the wall again and gain the count
room he might kill me but death now seem the happier choic of
evil without a paus i rush up to the east window and scrambl
down the wall as befor into the count room it wa empti but that
wa as i expect i could not see a kei anywher but the heap of gold
remain i went through the door in the corner and down the wind
stair and along the dark passag to the old chapel i knew now well
enough where to find the monster i sought
the great box wa in the same place close against the wall but the lid
wa laid on it not fasten down but with the nail readi in their
place to be hammer home i knew i must reach the bodi for the kei so
i rais the lid and laid it back against the wall and then i saw
someth which fill my veri soul with horror there lai the count
but look as if hi youth had been half renew for the white hair
and moustach were chang to dark irongrei the cheek were fuller
and the white skin seem rubyr underneath the mouth wa redder than
ever for on the lip were gout of fresh blood which trickl from the
corner of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck even the deep
burn ey seem set amongst swollen flesh for the lid and pouch
underneath were bloat it seem as if the whole aw creatur were
simpli gorg with blood he lai like a filthi leech exhaust with hi
replet i shudder as i bent over to touch him and everi sens in
me revolt at the contact but i had to search or i wa lost the
come night might see my own bodi a banquet in a similar wai to those
horrid three i felt all over the bodi but no sign could i find of the
kei then i stop and look at the count there wa a mock smile
on the bloat face which seem to drive me mad thi wa the be i
wa help to transfer to london where perhap for centuri to come
he might amongst it teem million satiat hi lust for blood and
creat a new and everwiden circl of semidemon to batten on the
helpless the veri thought drove me mad a terribl desir came upon me
to rid the world of such a monster there wa no lethal weapon at hand
but i seiz a shovel which the workmen had been us to fill the
case and lift it high struck with the edg downward at the
hate face but as i did so the head turn and the ey fell full
upon me with all their blaze of basilisk horror the sight seem to
paralys me and the shovel turn in my hand and glanc from the face
mere make a deep gash abov the forehead the shovel fell from my
hand across the box and as i pull it awai the flang of the blade
caught the edg of the lid which fell over again and hid the horrid
thing from my sight the last glimps i had wa of the bloat face
bloodstain and fix with a grin of malic which would have held it
own in the nethermost hell
i thought and thought what should be my next move but my brain seem
on fire and i wait with a despair feel grow over me as i
wait i heard in the distanc a gipsi song sung by merri voic come
closer and through their song the roll of heavi wheel and the
crack of whip the szgani and the slovak of whom the count had
spoken were come with a last look around and at the box which
contain the vile bodi i ran from the place and gain the count
room determin to rush out at the moment the door should be open
with strain ear i listen and heard downstair the grind of the
kei in the great lock and the fall back of the heavi door there must
have been some other mean of entri or some on had a kei for on of
the lock door then there came the sound of mani feet tramp and
dy awai in some passag which sent up a clang echo i turn to
run down again toward the vault where i might find the new entranc
but at the moment there seem to come a violent puff of wind and the
door to the wind stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from
the lintel fly when i ran to push it open i found that it wa
hopelessli fast i wa again a prison and the net of doom wa close
round me more close
as i write there is in the passag below a sound of mani tramp feet
and the crash of weight be set down heavili doubtless the box
with their freight of earth there is a sound of hammer it is the
box be nail down now i can hear the heavi feet tramp again
along the hall with mani other idl feet come behind them
the door is shut and the chain rattl there is a grind of the kei
in the lock i can hear the kei withdraw then anoth door open and
shut i hear the creak of lock and bolt
hark in the courtyard and down the rocki wai the roll of heavi wheel
the crack of whip and the choru of the szgani as thei pass into the
distanc
i am alon in the castl with those aw women faugh mina is a woman
and there is nought in common thei ar devil of the pit
i shall not remain alon with them i shall try to scale the castl wall
farther than i have yet attempt i shall take some of the gold with
me lest i want it later i mai find a wai from thi dread place
and then awai for home awai to the quickest and nearest train awai
from thi curs spot from thi curs land where the devil and hi
children still walk with earthli feet

24 juli whitbyluci met me at the station look sweeter and
loveli than ever and we drove up to the hous at the crescent in
which thei have room thi is a love place the littl river the
esk run through a deep vallei which broaden out as it come near the
harbour a great viaduct run across with high pier through which the
view seem somehow further awai than it realli is the vallei is
beautifulli green and it is so steep that when you ar on the high land
on either side you look right across it unless you ar near enough to
see down the hous of the old townth side awai from usar all
redroof and seem pile up on over the other anyhow like the
pictur we see of nuremberg right over the town is the ruin of whitbi
abbei which wa sack by the dane and which is the scene of part of
marmion where the girl wa built up in the wall it is a most nobl
ruin of immens size and full of beauti and romant bit there is
a legend that a white ladi is seen in on of the window between it and
the town there is anoth church the parish on round which is a big
graveyard all full of tombston thi is to my mind the nicest spot in
whitbi for it li right over the town and ha a full view of the
harbour and all up the bai to where the headland call kettl
stretch out into the sea it descend so steepli over the harbour that
part of the bank ha fallen awai and some of the grave have been
destroi in on place part of the stonework of the grave stretch
out over the sandi pathwai far below there ar walk with seat besid
them through the churchyard and peopl go and sit there all dai long
look at the beauti view and enjoi the breez i shall come and
sit here veri often myself and work inde i am write now with my
book on my knee and listen to the talk of three old men who ar
sit besid me thei seem to do noth all dai but sit up here and
talk
the harbour li below me with on the far side on long granit wall
stretch out into the sea with a curv outward at the end of it in
the middl of which is a lighthous a heavi seawal run along outsid
of it on the near side the seawal make an elbow crook invers
and it end too ha a lighthous between the two pier there is a
narrow open into the harbour which then suddenli widen
it is nice at high water but when the tide is out it shoal awai to
noth and there is mere the stream of the esk run between
bank of sand with rock here and there outsid the harbour on thi
side there rise for about half a mile a great reef the sharp edg of
which run straight out from behind the south lighthous at the end of
it is a buoi with a bell which swing in bad weather and send in a
mourn sound on the wind thei have a legend here that when a ship is
lost bell ar heard out at sea i must ask the old man about thi he
is come thi wai
he is a funni old man he must be awfulli old for hi face is all
gnarl and twist like the bark of a tree he tell me that he is
nearli a hundr and that he wa a sailor in the greenland fish
fleet when waterloo wa fought he is i am afraid a veri sceptic
person for when i ask him about the bell at sea and the white ladi
at the abbei he said veri brusqu
i wouldnt fash masel about them miss them thing be all wore out
mind i dont sai that thei never wa but i do sai that thei wasnt in
my time thei be all veri well for comer and tripper an the like
but not for a nice young ladi like you them feetfolk from york and
leed that be alwai eatin cure herrin an drinkin tea an lookin
out to bui cheap jet would creed aught i wonder masel whod be
bother tellin li to themeven the newspap which is full of
fooltalk i thought he would be a good person to learn interest
thing from so i ask him if he would mind tell me someth about
the whalefish in the old dai he wa just settl himself to begin
when the clock struck six whereupon he labour to get up and said
i must gang ageeanward home now miss my granddaught doesnt like
to be kept waitin when the tea is readi for it take me time to
cramml aboon the gree for there be a mani of em an miss i lack

the town up to the church there ar hundr of themi do not know how
manyand thei wind up in a delic curv the slope is so gentl that

not go thei will be home by thi
1 augusti came up here an hour ago with luci and we had a most
interest talk with my old friend and the two other who alwai come

anyth and downfac everybodi if he cant outargu them he bulli
them and then take their silenc for agreement with hi view luci

beauti colour sinc she ha been here i notic that the old men did
not lose ani time in come up and sit near her when we sat down
she is so sweet with old peopl i think thei all fell in love with her
on the spot even my old man succumb and did not contradict her but
gave me doubl share instead i got him on the subject of the legend
and he went off at onc into a sort of sermon i must try to rememb it
and put it down

watch how he get rid of hi spider he ha evid some deep problem
in hi mind for he keep a littl notebook in which he is alwai
jot down someth whole page of it ar fill with mass of
figur gener singl number ad up in batch and then the
total ad in batch again as though he were focuss some
account as the auditor put it
8 julyther is a method in hi mad and the rudimentari idea in
my mind is grow it will be a whole idea soon and then oh
unconsci cerebr you will have to give the wall to your
consciou brother i kept awai from my friend for a few dai so that i
might notic if there were ani chang thing remain as thei were except
that he ha part with some of hi pet and got a new on he ha
manag to get a sparrow and ha alreadi partial tame it hi mean

do remain howev ar well fed for he still bring in the fli by
tempt them with hi food
19 julyw ar progress my friend ha now a whole coloni of
sparrow and hi fli and spider ar almost obliter when i came
in he ran to me and said he want to ask me a great favoura veri
veri great favour and as he spoke he fawn on me like a dog i ask
him what it wa and he said with a sort of raptur in hi voic and
bear
a kitten a nice littl sleek play kitten that i can plai with
and teach and feedand feedand feed i wa not unprepar for thi
request for i had notic how hi pet went on increas in size and
vivac but i did not care that hi pretti famili of tame sparrow
should be wipe out in the same manner as the fli and the spider so
i said i would see about it and ask him if he would not rather have a
cat than a kitten hi eager betrai him as he answer
oh ye i would like a cat i onli ask for a kitten lest you should
refus me a cat no on would refus me a kitten would thei i shook
my head and said that at present i fear it would not be possibl but
that i would see about it hi face fell and i could see a warn of
danger in it for there wa a sudden fierc sidelong look which meant
kill the man is an undevelop homicid maniac i shall test him
with hi present crave and see how it will work out then i shall know
more
10 p mi have visit him again and found him sit in a corner
brood when i came in he threw himself on hi knee befor me and
implor me to let him have a cat that hi salvat depend upon it
i wa firm howev and told him that he could not have it whereupon
he went without a word and sat down gnaw hi finger in the corner
where i had found him i shall see him in the morn earli

that ha been buzz about my brain late is complet and the theori

gave mani fli to on spider and mani spider to on bird and then

bodi of holidaymak laid out yesterdai for visit to mulgrav wood
robin hood bai rig mill runswick staith and the variou trip in
the neighbourhood of whitbi the steamer emma and scarborough made
trip up and down the coast and there wa an unusu amount of
trip both to and from whitbi the dai wa unusu fine till the
afternoon when some of the gossip who frequent the east cliff
churchyard and from that command emin watch the wide sweep of
sea visibl to the north and east call attent to a sudden show of
marestail high in the sky to the northwest the wind wa then
blow from the southwest in the mild degre which in barometr
languag is rank no 2 light breez the coastguard on duti at onc
made report and on old fisherman who for more than half a centuri ha
kept watch on weather sign from the east cliff foretold in an emphat
manner the come of a sudden storm the approach of sunset wa so veri
beauti so grand in it mass of splendidlycolour cloud that
there wa quit an assemblag on the walk along the cliff in the old
churchyard to enjoi the beauti befor the sun dip below the black
mass of kettl stand boldli athwart the western sky it
downward wai wa mark by myriad cloud of everi sunsetcolourflam
purpl pink green violet and all the tint of gold with here and
there mass not larg but of seemingli absolut black in all
sort of shape as well outlin as coloss silhouett the
experi wa not lost on the painter and doubtless some of the
sketch of the prelud to the great storm will grace the r a and r
i wall in mai next more than on captain made up hi mind then and
there that hi cobbl or hi mule as thei term the differ
class of boat would remain in the harbour till the storm had pass
the wind fell awai entir dure the even and at midnight there
wa a dead calm a sultri heat and that prevail intens which on
the approach of thunder affect person of a sensit natur there
were but few light in sight at sea for even the coast steamer
which usual hug the shore so close kept well to seaward and but
few fishingboat were in sight the onli sail notic wa a foreign
schooner with all sail set which wa seemingli go westward the
foolhardi or ignor of her offic wa a prolif theme for
comment whilst she remain in sight and effort were made to signal
her to reduc sail in face of her danger befor the night shut down she
wa seen with sail idli flap as she gentli roll on the undul
swell of the sea
as idl as a paint ship upon a paint ocean
shortli befor ten oclock the still of the air grew quit
oppress and the silenc wa so mark that the bleat of a sheep
inland or the bark of a dog in the town wa distinctli heard and the
band on the pier with it live french air wa like a discord in the
great harmoni of natur silenc a littl after midnight came a
strang sound from over the sea and high overhead the air began to
carri a strang faint hollow boom
then without warn the tempest broke with a rapid which at the
time seem incred and even afterward is imposs to realiz
the whole aspect of natur at onc becam convuls the wave rose in
grow furi each overtop it fellow till in a veri few minut
the late glassi sea wa like a roar and devour monster
whitecrest wave beat madli on the level sand and rush up the
shelv cliff other broke over the pier and with their spume swept
the lanthorn of the lighthous which rise from the end of either pier
of whitbi harbour the wind roar like thunder and blew with such
forc that it wa with difficulti that even strong men kept their feet
or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchion it wa found necessari
to clear the entir pier from the mass of onlook or els the
fatal of the night would have been increas manifold to add to
the difficulti and danger of the time mass of seafog came
drift inlandwhit wet cloud which swept by in ghostli fashion
so dank and damp and cold that it need but littl effort of
imagin to think that the spirit of those lost at sea were
touch their live brethren with the clammi hand of death and mani
a on shudder as the wreath of seamist swept by at time the mist
clear and the sea for some distanc could be seen in the glare of the
lightn which now came thick and fast follow by such sudden peal
of thunder that the whole sky overhead seem trembl under the shock
of the footstep of the storm
some of the scene thu reveal were of immeasur grandeur and of
absorb interestth sea run mountain high threw skyward with
each wave mighti mass of white foam which the tempest seem to
snatch at and whirl awai into space here and there a fishingboat with
a rag of sail run madli for shelter befor the blast now and again
the white wing of a stormtoss seabird on the summit of the east
cliff the new searchlight wa readi for experi but had not yet been
tri the offic in charg of it got it into work order and in
the paus of the inrush mist swept with it the surfac of the sea
onc or twice it servic wa most effect as when a fishingboat
with gunwal under water rush into the harbour abl by the guidanc
of the shelter light to avoid the danger of dash against the
pier as each boat achiev the safeti of the port there wa a shout of
joi from the mass of peopl on shore a shout which for a moment seem
to cleav the gale and wa then swept awai in it rush
befor long the searchlight discov some distanc awai a schooner
with all sail set appar the same vessel which had been notic
earlier in the even the wind had by thi time back to the east
and there wa a shudder amongst the watcher on the cliff as thei
realiz the terribl danger in which she now wa between her and the
port lai the great flat reef on which so mani good ship have from time
to time suffer and with the wind blow from it present quarter
it would be quit imposs that she should fetch the entranc of the
harbour it wa now nearli the hour of high tide but the wave were so
great that in their trough the shallow of the shore were almost
visibl and the schooner with all sail set wa rush with such
speed that in the word of on old salt she must fetch up somewher
if it wa onli in hell then came anoth rush of seafog greater than
ani hithertoa mass of dank mist which seem to close on all thing
like a grei pall and left avail to men onli the organ of hear
for the roar of the tempest and the crash of the thunder and the
boom of the mighti billow came through the damp oblivion even louder
than befor the rai of the searchlight were kept fix on the harbour
mouth across the east pier where the shock wa expect and men wait
breathless the wind suddenli shift to the northeast and the remnant
of the seafog melt in the blast and then mirabil dictu between
the pier leap from wave to wave as it rush at headlong speed
swept the strang schooner befor the blast with all sail set and
gain the safeti of the harbour the searchlight follow her and a
shudder ran through all who saw her for lash to the helm wa a
corps with droop head which swung horribl to and fro at each
motion of the ship no other form could be seen on deck at all a great
aw came on all as thei realis that the ship as if by a miracl had
found the harbour unsteer save by the hand of a dead man howev
all took place more quickli than it take to write these word the
schooner paus not but rush across the harbour pitch herself on
that accumul of sand and gravel wash by mani tide and mani
storm into the southeast corner of the pier jut under the east
cliff known local as tate hill pier
there wa of cours a consider concuss as the vessel drove up on
the sand heap everi spar rope and stai wa strain and some of the
tophamm came crash down but strangest of all the veri instant
the shore wa touch an immens dog sprang up on deck from below as
if shot up by the concuss and run forward jump from the bow
on the sand make straight for the steep cliff where the churchyard
hang over the lanewai to the east pier so steepli that some of the flat
tombstonesthruffstean or throughston as thei call them in
the whitbi vernacularactu project over where the sustain cliff
ha fallen awai it disappear in the dark which seem
intensifi just beyond the focu of the searchlight
it so happen that there wa no on at the moment on tate hill pier as
all those whose hous ar in close proxim were either in bed or were
out on the height abov thu the coastguard on duti on the eastern
side of the harbour who at onc ran down to the littl pier wa the
first to climb on board the men work the searchlight after scour
the entranc of the harbour without see anyth then turn the
light on the derelict and kept it there the coastguard ran aft and
when he came besid the wheel bent over to examin it and recoil at
onc as though under some sudden emot thi seem to piqu gener
curios and quit a number of peopl began to run it is a good wai
round from the west cliff by the drawbridg to tate hill pier but your
correspond is a fairli good runner and came well ahead of the crowd
when i arriv howev i found alreadi assembl on the pier a crowd
whom the coastguard and polic refus to allow to come on board by the
courtesi of the chief boatman i wa as your correspond permit
to climb on deck and wa on of a small group who saw the dead seaman
whilst actual lash to the wheel
it wa no wonder that the coastguard wa surpris or even aw for
not often can such a sight have been seen the man wa simpli fasten
by hi hand ti on over the other to a spoke of the wheel between
the inner hand and the wood wa a crucifix the set of bead on which it
wa fasten be around both wrist and wheel and all kept fast by
the bind cord the poor fellow mai have been seat at on time but
the flap and buffet of the sail had work through the rudder of
the wheel and drag him to and fro so that the cord with which he
wa ti had cut the flesh to the bone accur note wa made of the
state of thing and a doctorsurgeon j m caffyn of 33 east elliot
placewho came immedi after me declar after make
examin that the man must have been dead for quit two dai in hi
pocket wa a bottl carefulli cork empti save for a littl roll of
paper which prove to be the addendum to the log the coastguard said
the man must have ti up hi own hand fasten the knot with hi
teeth the fact that a coastguard wa the first on board mai save some
complic later on in the admiralti court for coastguard cannot
claim the salvag which is the right of the first civilian enter on a
derelict alreadi howev the legal tongu ar wag and on young
law student is loudli assert that the right of the owner ar alreadi
complet sacrif hi properti be held in contravent of the
statut of mortmain sinc the tiller as emblemship if not proof of

that the dead steersman ha been rever remov from the place where
he held hi honour watch and ward till deatha steadfast as

alreadi the sudden storm is pass and it fierc is abat

detail of the derelict ship which found her wai so miracul into

it seem to have disappear entir from the town it mai be that it
wa frighten and made it wai on to the moor where it is still
hide in terror there ar some who look with dread on such a

when i got to it found no on there the wind wa steadi and as we ran
befor it there wa no yaw i dare not leav it so shout for the
mate after a few second he rush up on deck in hi flannel he
look wildei and haggard and i greatli fear hi reason ha given
wai he came close to me and whisper hoars with hi mouth to my
ear as though fear the veri air might hear it is here i know
it now on the watch last night i saw it like a man tall and thin
and ghastli pale it wa in the bow and look out i crept behind
it and gave it my knife but the knife went through it empti as the
air and as he spoke he took hi knife and drove it savag into

hold perhap in on of those box ill unscrew them on by on and
see you work the helm and with a warn look and hi finger on hi
lip he went below there wa spring up a choppi wind and i could
not leav the helm i saw him come out on deck again with a toolchest
and a lantern and go down the forward hatchwai he is mad stark
rave mad and it no us my try to stop him he cant hurt those
big box thei ar invoic as clai and to pull them about is as
harmless a thing as he can do so here i stai and mind the helm and
write these note i can onli trust in god and wait till the fog clear
then if i cant steer to ani harbour with the wind that is i shall cut
down sail and lie by and signal for help
it is nearli all over now just as i wa begin to hope that the mate
would come out calmerfor i heard him knock awai at someth in the
hold and work is good for himther came up the hatchwai a sudden
startl scream which made my blood run cold and up on the deck he
came as if shot from a guna rage madman with hi ey roll and
hi face convuls with fear save me save me he cri and then
look round on the blanket of fog hi horror turn to despair and in
a steadi voic he said you had better come too captain befor it is
too late he is there i know the secret now the sea will save me
from him and it is all that is left befor i could sai a word or
move forward to seiz him he sprang on the bulwark and deliber
threw himself into the sea i suppos i know the secret too now it wa
thi madman who had got rid of the men on by on and now he ha
follow them himself god help me how am i to account for all these
horror when i get to port when i get to port will that ever be
4 auguststil fog which the sunris cannot pierc i know there is
sunris becaus i am a sailor why els i know not i dare not go
below i dare not leav the helm so here all night i stai and in
the dim of the night i saw ithim god forgiv me but the mate wa
right to jump overboard it wa better to die like a man to die like a
sailor in blue water no man can object but i am captain and i must not
leav my ship but i shall baffl thi fiend or monster for i shall tie
my hand to the wheel when my strength begin to fail and along with
them i shall tie that which heitdar not touch and then come good
wind or foul i shall save my soul and my honour as a captain i am
grow weaker and the night is come on if he can look me in the
face again i mai not have time to act if we ar wreck mayhap
thi bottl mai be found and those who find it mai understand if not
well then all men shall know that i have been true to my trust god
and the bless virgin and the saint help a poor ignor soul try
to do hi duti
of cours the verdict wa an open on there is no evid to adduc
and whether or not the man himself commit the murder there is now
none to sai the folk here hold almost univers that the captain is
simpli a hero and he is to be given a public funer alreadi it is
arrang that hi bodi is to be taken with a train of boat up the esk
for a piec and then brought back to tate hill pier and up the abbei
step for he is to be buri in the churchyard on the cliff the owner
of more than a hundr boat have alreadi given in their name as
wish to follow him to the grave
no trace ha ever been found of the great dog at which there is much
mourn for with public opinion in it present state he would i
believ be adopt by the town tomorrow will see the funer and so
will end thi on more mysteri of the sea

8 augustluci wa veri restless all night and i too could not
sleep the storm wa fear and as it boom loudli among the
chimneypot it made me shudder when a sharp puff came it seem to be
like a distant gun strang enough luci did not wake but she got up
twice and dress herself fortun each time i awok in time and
manag to undress her without wake her and got her back to bed it
is a veri strang thing thi sleepwalk for as soon as her will is
thwart in ani physic wai her intent if there be ani

life
earli in the morn we both got up and went down to the harbour to see
if anyth had happen in the night there were veri few peopl about
and though the sun wa bright and the air clear and fresh the big
grimlook wave that seem dark themselv becaus the foam that
top them wa like snow forc themselv in through the narrow mouth
of the harbourlik a bulli man go through a crowd somehow i
felt glad that jonathan wa not on the sea last night but on land but
oh is he on land or sea where is he and how i am get fearfulli
anxiou about him if i onli knew what to do and could do anyth
10 augustth funer of the poor seacaptain todai wa most
touch everi boat in the harbour seem to be there and the coffin
wa carri by captain all the wai from tate hill pier up to the
churchyard luci came with me and we went earli to our old seat whilst
the cortg of boat went up the river to the viaduct and came down
again we had a love view and saw the process nearli all the wai
the poor fellow wa laid to rest quit near our seat so that we stood on
it when the time came and saw everyth poor luci seem much upset
she wa restless and uneasi all the time and i cannot but think that
her dream at night is tell on her she is quit odd in on thing
she will not admit to me that there is ani caus for restless or if
there be she doe not understand it herself there is an addit
caus in that poor old mr swale wa found dead thi morn on our
seat hi neck be broken he had evid as the doctor said
fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright for there wa a look of
fear and horror on hi face that the men said made them shudder poor
dear old man perhap he had seen death with hi dy ey luci is so
sweet and sensit that she feel influenc more acut than other
peopl do just now she wa quit upset by a littl thing which i did
not much heed though i am myself veri fond of anim on of the men
who came up here often to look for the boat wa follow by hi dog
the dog is alwai with him thei ar both quiet person and i never saw
the man angri nor heard the dog bark dure the servic the dog would
not come to it master who wa on the seat with us but kept a few
yard off bark and howl it master spoke to it gentli and then
harshli and then angrili but it would neither come nor ceas to make a
nois it wa in a sort of furi with it ey savag and all it hair
bristl out like a cat tail when puss is on the warpath final
the man too got angri and jump down and kick the dog and then
took it by the scruff of the neck and half drag and half threw it on
the tombston on which the seat is fix the moment it touch the
stone the poor thing becam quiet and fell all into a trembl it did
not try to get awai but crouch down quiver and cower and wa
in such a pitiabl state of terror that i tri though without effect
to comfort it luci wa full of piti too but she did not attempt to
touch the dog but look at it in an agonis sort of wai i greatli
fear that she is of too supersensit a natur to go through the world
without troubl she will be dream of thi tonight i am sure the
whole agglomer of thingsth ship steer into port by a dead
man hi attitud ti to the wheel with a crucifix and bead the
touch funer the dog now furiou and now in terrorwil all
afford materi for her dream
i think it will be best for her to go to bed tire out physic so i
shall take her for a long walk by the cliff to robin hood bai and
back she ought not to have much inclin for sleepwalk then

the east cliff in the hope or feari dont know whichof see luci
in our favourit seat there wa a bright full moon with heavi black
drive cloud which threw the whole scene into a fleet diorama of
light and shade as thei sail across for a moment or two i could see
noth as the shadow of a cloud obscur st mari church and all
around it then as the cloud pass i could see the ruin of the abbei
come into view and as the edg of a narrow band of light as sharp as
a swordcut move along the church and the churchyard becam gradual
visibl whatev my expect wa it wa not disappoint for
there on our favourit seat the silver light of the moon struck a
halfreclin figur snowi white the come of the cloud wa too
quick for me to see much for shadow shut down on light almost
immedi but it seem to me as though someth dark stood behind
the seat where the white figur shone and bent over it what it wa
whether man or beast i could not tell i did not wait to catch anoth
glanc but flew down the steep step to the pier and along by the
fishmarket to the bridg which wa the onli wai to reach the east
cliff the town seem as dead for not a soul did i see i rejoic
that it wa so for i want no wit of poor luci condit the
time and distanc seem endless and my knee trembl and my breath
came labour as i toil up the endless step to the abbei i must have
gone fast and yet it seem to me as if my feet were weight with
lead and as though everi joint in my bodi were rusti when i got almost
to the top i could see the seat and the white figur for i wa now
close enough to distinguish it even through the spell of shadow there
wa undoubtedli someth long and black bend over the
halfreclin white figur i call in fright luci luci and
someth rais a head and from where i wa i could see a white face
and red gleam ey luci did not answer and i ran on to the
entranc of the churchyard as i enter the church wa between me and
the seat and for a minut or so i lost sight of her when i came in
view again the cloud had pass and the moonlight struck so brilliantli
that i could see luci half reclin with her head ly over the back
of the seat she wa quit alon and there wa not a sign of ani live
thing about
when i bent over her i could see that she wa still asleep her lip
were part and she wa breathingnot softli as usual with her but in
long heavi gasp as though strive to get her lung full at everi
breath as i came close she put up her hand in her sleep and pull the
collar of her nightdress close around her throat whilst she did so
there came a littl shudder through her as though she felt the cold i
flung the warm shawl over her and drew the edg tight round her neck
for i dread lest she should get some deadli chill from the night air
unclad as she wa i fear to wake her all at onc so in order to
have my hand free that i might help her i fasten the shawl at her
throat with a big safetypin but i must have been clumsi in my anxieti
and pinch or prick her with it for byandbi when her breath
becam quieter she put her hand to her throat again and moan when i
had her carefulli wrap up i put my shoe on her feet and then began
veri gentli to wake her at first she did not respond but gradual she
becam more and more uneasi in her sleep moan and sigh
occasion at last as time wa pass fast and for mani other
reason i wish to get her home at onc i shook her more forcibl
till final she open her ey and awok she did not seem surpris
to see me as of cours she did not realis all at onc where she wa
luci alwai wake prettili and even at such a time when her bodi must
have been chill with cold and her mind somewhat appal at wake
unclad in a churchyard at night she did not lose her grace she
trembl a littl and clung to me when i told her to come at onc with
me home she rose without a word with the obedi of a child as we
pass along the gravel hurt my feet and luci notic me winc she
stop and want to insist upon my take my shoe but i would not
howev when we got to the pathwai outsid the churchyard where there
wa a puddl of water remain from the storm i daub my feet with
mud us each foot in turn on the other so that as we went home no
on in case we should meet ani on should notic my bare feet
fortun favour us and we got home without meet a soul onc we saw
a man who seem not quit sober pass along a street in front of
us but we hid in a door till he had disappear up an open such as
there ar here steep littl close or wynd as thei call them in
scotland my heart beat so loud all the time that sometim i thought i

14 auguston the east cliff read and write all dai luci seem
to have becom as much in love with the spot as i am and it is hard to
get her awai from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or
dinner thi afternoon she made a funni remark we were come home for
dinner and had come to the top of the step up from the west pier and
stop to look at the view as we gener do the set sun low
down in the sky wa just drop behind kettl the red light wa
thrown over on the east cliff and the old abbei and seem to bath
everyth in a beauti rosi glow we were silent for a while and
suddenli luci murmur as if to herself
hi red ey again thei ar just the same it wa such an odd
express come apropo of noth that it quit startl me i
slew round a littl so as to see luci well without seem to stare
at her and saw that she wa in a halfdreami state with an odd look on
her face that i could not quit make out so i said noth but
follow her ey she appear to be look over at our own seat
whereon wa a dark figur seat alon i wa a littl startl myself
for it seem for an instant as if the stranger had great ey like
burn flame but a second look dispel the illus the red
sunlight wa shine on the window of st mari church behind our
seat and as the sun dip there wa just suffici chang in the
refract and reflect to make it appear as if the light move i
call luci attent to the peculiar effect and she becam herself
with a start but she look sad all the same it mai have been that she
wa think of that terribl night up there we never refer to it so i
said noth and we went home to dinner luci had a headach and went
earli to bed i saw her asleep and went out for a littl stroll myself
i walk along the cliff to the westward and wa full of sweet
sad for i wa think of jonathan when come homeit wa then
bright moonlight so bright that though the front of our part of the
crescent wa in shadow everyth could be well seeni threw a glanc
up at our window and saw luci head lean out i thought that
perhap she wa look out for me so i open my handkerchief and
wave it she did not notic or make ani movement whatev just then
the moonlight crept round an angl of the build and the light fell
on the window there distinctli wa luci with her head ly up against
the side of the windowsil and her ey shut she wa fast asleep and
by her seat on the windowsil wa someth that look like a
goodsiz bird i wa afraid she might get a chill so i ran upstair
but as i came into the room she wa move back to her bed fast
asleep and breath heavili she wa hold her hand to her throat
as though to protect it from cold
i did not wake her but tuck her up warmli i have taken care that the
door is lock and the window secur fasten
she look so sweet as she sleep but she is paler than is her wont and
there is a drawn haggard look under her ey which i do not like i
fear she is fret about someth i wish i could find out what it
is

attent wa call by the sound of the window be wrench out he
ran back and saw hi feet disappear through the window and had at onc
sent up for me he wa onli in hi nightgear and cannot be far off
the attend thought it would be more us to watch where he should
go than to follow him as he might lose sight of him whilst get out
of the build by the door he is a bulki man and couldnt get through
the window i am thin so with hi aid i got out but feet foremost
and as we were onli a few feet abov ground land unhurt the
attend told me the patient had gone to the left and had taken a
straight line so i ran as quickli as i could as i got through the belt

my dear old fellow
with regard to miss westenra health i hasten to let you know at onc
that in my opinion there is not ani function disturb or ani maladi
that i know of at the same time i am not by ani mean satisfi with
her appear she is woefulli differ from what she wa when i saw
her last of cours you must bear in mind that i did not have full
opportun of examin such as i should wish our veri friendship
make a littl difficulti which not even medic scienc or custom can
bridg over i had better tell you exactli what happen leav you to
draw in a measur your own conclus i shall then sai what i have
done and propos do
i found miss westenra in seemingli gai spirit her mother wa present
and in a few second i made up my mind that she wa try all she knew
to mislead her mother and prevent her from be anxiou i have no
doubt she guess if she doe not know what need of caution there is
we lunch alon and as we all exert ourselv to be cheer we
got as some kind of reward for our labour some real cheer
amongst us then mr westenra went to lie down and luci wa left with
me we went into her boudoir and till we got there her gaieti remain
for the servant were come and go as soon as the door wa close
howev the mask fell from her face and she sank down into a chair
with a great sigh and hid her ey with her hand when i saw that her
high spirit had fail i at onc took advantag of her reaction to
make a diagnosi she said to me veri sweetli
i cannot tell you how i loath talk about myself i remind her
that a doctor confid wa sacr but that you were grievous
anxiou about her she caught on to my mean at onc and settl that
matter in a word tell arthur everyth you choos i do not care for
myself but all for him so i am quit free
i could easili see that she is somewhat bloodless but i could not see
the usual anmic sign and by a chanc i wa actual abl to test the
qualiti of her blood for in open a window which wa stiff a cord
gave wai and she cut her hand slightli with broken glass it wa a
slight matter in itself but it gave me an evid chanc and i secur
a few drop of the blood and have analys them the qualit
analysi give a quit normal condit and show i should infer in
itself a vigor state of health in other physic matter i wa quit
satisfi that there is no need for anxieti but as there must be a
caus somewher i have come to the conclus that it must be someth
mental she complain of difficulti in breath satisfactorili at
time and of heavi letharg sleep with dream that frighten her but
regard which she can rememb noth she sai that as a child she
us to walk in her sleep and that when in whitbi the habit came back
and that onc she walk out in the night and went to east cliff where
miss murrai found her but she assur me that of late the habit ha not
return i am in doubt and so have done the best thing i know of i
have written to my old friend and master professor van hels of
amsterdam who know as much about obscur diseas as ani on in the
world i have ask him to come over and as you told me that all thing
were to be at your charg i have mention to him who you ar and your
relat to miss westenra thi my dear fellow is in obedi to
your wish for i am onli too proud and happi to do anyth i can for
her van hels would i know do anyth for me for a person
reason so no matter on what ground he come we must accept hi
wish he is a seemingli arbitrari man but thi is becaus he know
what he is talk about better than ani on els he is a philosoph
and a metaphysician and on of the most advanc scientist of hi dai
and he ha i believ an absolut open mind thi with an iron
nerv a temper of the icebrook an indomit resolut
selfcommand and toler exalt from virtu to bless and the
kindliest and truest heart that beatsthes form hi equip for the
nobl work that he is do for mankindwork both in theori and
practic for hi view ar as wide as hi allembrac sympathi i
tell you these fact that you mai know why i have such confid in

he had onli on outburst and that wa yesterdai at an unusu time just
befor the stroke of noon he began to grow restless the attend knew
the symptom and at onc summon aid fortun the men came at a
run and were just in time for at the stroke of noon he becam so
violent that it took all their strength to hold him in about five
minut howev he began to get more and more quiet and final sank
into a sort of melancholi in which state he ha remain up to now the
attend tell me that hi scream whilst in the paroxysm were realli
appal i found my hand full when i got in attend to some of the
other patient who were frighten by him inde i can quit
understand the effect for the sound disturb even me though i wa
some distanc awai it is now after the dinnerhour of the asylum and
as yet my patient sit in a corner brood with a dull sullen
woebegon look in hi face which seem rather to indic than to show
someth directli i cannot quit understand it
lateranoth chang in my patient at five oclock i look in on
him and found him seemingli as happi and content as he us to be he
wa catch fli and eat them and wa keep note of hi captur
by make nailmark on the edg of the door between the ridg of
pad when he saw me he came over and apologis for hi bad
conduct and ask me in a veri humbl cring wai to be led back to
hi own room and to have hi notebook again i thought it well to
humour him so he is back in hi room with the window open he ha the
sugar of hi tea spread out on the windowsil and is reap quit a
harvest of fli he is not now eat them but put them into a
box as of old and is alreadi examin the corner of hi room to find
a spider i tri to get him to talk about the past few dai for ani
clue to hi thought would be of immens help to me but he would not
rise for a moment or two he look veri sad and said in a sort of
farawai voic as though sai it rather to himself than to me
all over all over he ha desert me no hope for me now unless i do
it for myself then suddenli turn to me in a resolut wai he said
doctor wont you be veri good to me and let me have a littl more
sugar i think it would be good for me
and the fli i said
ye the fli like it too and i like the fli therefor i like
it and there ar peopl who know so littl as to think that madmen do
not argu i procur him a doubl suppli and left him as happi a man
as i suppos ani in the world i wish i could fathom hi mind
midnightanoth chang in him i had been to see miss westenra
whom i found much better and had just return and wa stand at our
own gate look at the sunset when onc more i heard him yell as
hi room is on thi side of the hous i could hear it better than in
the morn it wa a shock to me to turn from the wonder smoki
beauti of a sunset over london with it lurid light and inki shadow
and all the marvel tint that come on foul cloud even as on foul
water and to realis all the grim stern of my own cold stone
build with it wealth of breath miseri and my own desol heart
to endur it all i reach him just as the sun wa go down and from
hi window saw the red disc sink as it sank he becam less and less
frenzi and just as it dip he slid from the hand that held him an
inert mass on the floor it is wonder howev what intellectu
recup power lunat have for within a few minut he stood up
quit calmli and look around him i signal to the attend not to
hold him for i wa anxiou to see what he would do he went straight
over to the window and brush out the crumb of sugar then he took hi
flybox and empti it outsid and threw awai the box then he shut
the window and cross over sat down on hi bed all thi surpris
me so i ask him ar you not go to keep fli ani more
no said he i am sick of all that rubbish he certainli is a
wonderfulli interest studi i wish i could get some glimps of hi
mind or of the caus of hi sudden passion stop there mai be a clue
after all if we can find why todai hi paroxysm came on at high noon
and at sunset can it be that there is a malign influenc of the sun at
period which affect certain naturesa at time the moon doe other

someth like the wai dame natur gather round a foreign bodi an
envelop of some insensit tissu which can protect from evil that

isself he didnt git angri as i op he would but he smile a kind
of insol smile with a mouth full of white sharp teeth oh no thei
wouldnt like me e sai
ow ye thei would sai i aimitatin of him thei alwai like a
bone or two to clean their teeth on about teatim which you as a
bag
well it wa a odd thing but when the animil see us atalkin thei
lai down and when i went over to bersick he let me stroke hi ear
same as ever that there man kem over and bless but if he didnt put
in hi hand and stroke the old wolf ear too
tyke care sai i bersick is quick
never mind he sai im us to em
ar you in the busi yourself i sai tyke off my at for a
man what trade in wolv anceter is a good friend to keeper
no sai he not exactli in the busi but i av made pet of
sever and with that he lift hi at as perlit as a lord and walk
awai old bersick kep alookin arter im till e wa out of sight
and then went and lai down in a corner and wouldnt come hout the ol
heven well larst night so soon as the moon wa hup the wolv
here all began aowl there warnt noth for them to owl at
there warnt no on near except some on that wa evid acallin a
dog somewher out back of the gard in the park road onc or twice
i went out to see that all wa right and it wa and then the owl
stop just befor twelv oclock i just took a look round afor
turnin in an bust me but when i kem opposit to old bersick
cage i see the rail broken and twist about and the cage empti and
that all i know for cert
did ani on els see anyth
on of our gardner wa acomin om about that time from a armoni
when he see a big grei dog comin out through the gard edg at
least so he sai but i dont give much for it myself for if he did e
never said a word about it to hi missi when e got om and it wa
onli after the escap of the wolf wa made known and we had been up all
nightahuntin of the park for bersick that he rememb seein
anyth my own belief wa that the armoni ad got into hi ead
now mr bilder can you account in ani wai for the escap of the
wolf
well sir he said with a suspici sort of modesti i think i can
but i dont know as ow youd be satisfi with the theori
certainli i shall if a man like you who know the anim from
experi cant hazard a good guess at ani rate who is even to try
well then sir i account for it thi wai it seem to me that er
wolf escapedsimpli becaus he want to get out
from the hearti wai that both thoma and hi wife laugh at the joke i
could see that it had done servic befor and that the whole
explan wa simpli an elabor sell i couldnt cope in badinag
with the worthi thoma but i thought i knew a surer wai to hi heart
so i said
now mr bilder well consid that first halfsovereign work off
and thi brother of hi is wait to be claim when youv told me
what you think will happen
right yare sir he said briskli yell excoos me i know for
achaffin of ye but the old woman here wink at me which wa as much
as tell me to go on
well i never said the old ladi
my opinion is thi that er wolf is aidin of somewher the
gardner wot didnt rememb said he wa agallopin northward faster
than a hors could go but i dont believ him for yer see sir
wolv dont gallop no more nor dog doe thei not bein built that
wai wolv is fine thing in a storybook and i dessai when thei get
in pack and doe be chivyin somethin that more afear than thei is
thei can make a devil of a nois and chop it up whatev it is but
lor bless you in real life a wolf is onli a low creatur not half so
clever or bold as a good dog and not half a quarter so much fight in
im thi on aint been us to fightin or even to providin for
hisself and more like he somewher round the park aidin an
ashiverin of and if he think at all wonderin where he is to get
hi breakfast from or mayb he got down some area and is in a
coalcellar my ey wont some cook get a rum start when she see hi
green ey ashin at her out of the dark if he cant get food he
bound to look for it and mayhap he mai chanc to light on a butcher
shop in time if he doesnt and some nursemaid goe awalkin orf with
a soldier leavin of the hinfant in the perambulatorwel then i
shouldnt be surpris if the censu is on babbi the less that
all
i wa hand him the halfsovereign when someth came bob up
against the window and mr bilder face doubl it natur length
with surpris
god bless me he said if there aint old bersick come back by
isself
he went to the door and open it a most unnecessari proceed it
seem to me i have alwai thought that a wild anim never look so
well as when some obstacl of pronounc durabl is between us a
person experi ha intensifi rather than diminish that idea
after all howev there is noth like custom for neither bilder nor
hi wife thought ani more of the wolf than i should of a dog the anim
itself wa as peac and wellbehav as that father of all
picturewolvesr ride hood quondam friend whilst move her
confid in masquerad
the whole scene wa an unutter mixtur of comedi and patho the
wick wolf that for half a dai had paralys london and set all the
children in the town shiver in their shoe wa there in a sort of
penit mood and wa receiv and pet like a sort of vulpin
prodig son old bilder examin him all over with most tender
solicitud and when he had finish with hi penit said
there i knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of troubl
didnt i sai it all along here hi head all cut and full of broken
glass es been agettin over some bloomin wall or other it a
shyme that peopl ar allow to top their wall with broken bottl
thi er what come of it come along bersick
he took the wolf and lock him up in a cage with a piec of meat that
satisfi in quantiti at ani rate the elementari condit of the
fat calf and went off to report
i came off too to report the onli exclus inform that is given
todai regard the strang escapad at the zoo

dr seward diari
18 septemberi drove at onc to hillingham and arriv earli
keep my cab at the gate i went up the avenu alon i knock gentli
and rang as quietli as possibl for i fear to disturb luci or her
mother and hope to onli bring a servant to the door after a while
find no respons i knock and rang again still no answer i curs
the lazi of the servant that thei should lie ab at such an
hourfor it wa now ten oclockand so rang and knock again but
more impati but still without respons hitherto i had blame onli
the servant but now a terribl fear began to assail me wa thi
desol but anoth link in the chain of doom which seem draw
tight around us wa it inde a hous of death to which i had come too
late i knew that minut even second of delai might mean hour of
danger to luci if she had had again on of those fright relaps
and i went round the hous to try if i could find by chanc an entri
anywher
i could find no mean of ingress everi window and door wa fasten and
lock and i return baffl to the porch as i did so i heard the
rapid pitpat of a swiftli driven hors feet thei stop at the
gate and a few second later i met van hels run up the avenu
when he saw me he gasp out
then it wa you and just arriv how is she ar we too late did you
not get my telegram
i answer as quickli and coher as i could that i had onli got hi
telegram earli in the morn and had not lost a minut in come here
and that i could not make ani on in the hous hear me he paus and
rais hi hat as he said solemnli
then i fear we ar too late god will be done with hi usual
recup energi he went on come if there be no wai open to get
in we must make on time is all in all to us now
we went round to the back of the hous where there wa a kitchen
window the professor took a small surgic saw from hi case and
hand it to me point to the iron bar which guard the window i
attack them at onc and had veri soon cut through three of them then
with a long thin knife we push back the fasten of the sash and
open the window i help the professor in and follow him there
wa no on in the kitchen or in the servant room which were close at
hand we tri all the room as we went along and in the diningroom
dimli lit by rai of light through the shutter found four
servantwomen ly on the floor there wa no need to think them dead
for their stertor breath and the acrid smell of laudanum in the
room left no doubt as to their condit van hels and i look at
each other and as we move awai he said we can attend to them later
then we ascend to luci room for an instant or two we paus at the
door to listen but there wa no sound that we could hear with white
face and trembl hand we open the door gentli and enter the
room
how shall i describ what we saw on the bed lai two women luci and her
mother the latter lai farthest in and she wa cover with a white
sheet the edg of which had been blown back by the draught through the
broken window show the drawn white face with a look of terror
fix upon it by her side lai luci with face white and still more
drawn the flower which had been round her neck we found upon her
mother bosom and her throat wa bare show the two littl wound
which we had notic befor but look horribl white and mangl
without a word the professor bent over the bed hi head almost touch
poor luci breast then he gave a quick turn of hi head as of on who
listen and leap to hi feet he cri out to me
it is not yet too late quick quick bring the brandi
i flew downstair and return with it take care to smell and tast
it lest it too were drug like the decant of sherri which i found
on the tabl the maid were still breath but more restlessli and i
fanci that the narcot wa wear off i did not stai to make sure
but return to van hels he rub the brandi as on anoth
occas on her lip and gum and on her wrist and the palm of her
hand he said to me
i can do thi all that can be at the present you go wake those maid
flick them in the face with a wet towel and flick them hard make them
get heat and fire and a warm bath thi poor soul is nearli as cold as
that besid her she will need be heat befor we can do anyth
more
i went at onc and found littl difficulti in wake three of the
women the fourth wa onli a young girl and the drug had evid
affect her more strongli so i lift her on the sofa and let her
sleep the other were daze at first but as remembr came back to
them thei cri and sob in a hyster manner i wa stern with
them howev and would not let them talk i told them that on life
wa bad enough to lose and that if thei delai thei would sacrific
miss luci so sob and cry thei went about their wai half clad
as thei were and prepar fire and water fortun the kitchen and
boiler fire were still aliv and there wa no lack of hot water we
got a bath and carri luci out as she wa and place her in it whilst
we were busi chafe her limb there wa a knock at the hall door on
of the maid ran off hurri on some more cloth and open it then
she return and whisper to us that there wa a gentleman who had come
with a messag from mr holmwood i bade her simpli tell him that he
must wait for we could see no on now she went awai with the messag
and engross with our work i clean forgot all about him
i never saw in all my experi the professor work in such deadli
earnest i knewa he knewthat it wa a standup fight with death
and in a paus told him so he answer me in a wai that i did not
understand but with the sternest look that hi face could wear
if that were all i would stop here where we ar now and let her fade
awai into peac for i see no light in life over her horizon he went
on with hi work with if possibl renew and more frenzi vigour
present we both began to be consciou that the heat wa begin to
be of some effect luci heart beat a trifl more audibl to the
stethoscop and her lung had a percept movement van hels
face almost beam and as we lift her from the bath and roll her in
a hot sheet to dry her he said to me
the first gain is our check to the king
we took luci into anoth room which had by now been prepar and laid
her in bed and forc a few drop of brandi down her throat i notic
that van hels ti a soft silk handkerchief round her throat she wa
still unconsci and wa quit as bad as if not wors than we had
ever seen her
van hels call in on of the women and told her to stai with her
and not to take her ey off her till we return and then beckon me
out of the room
we must consult as to what is to be done he said as we descend the
stair in the hall he open the diningroom door and we pass in he
close the door carefulli behind him the shutter had been open but
the blind were alreadi down with that obedi to the etiquett of
death which the british woman of the lower class alwai rigidli
observ the room wa therefor dimli dark it wa howev light
enough for our purpos van hels stern wa somewhat reliev
by a look of perplex he wa evid tortur hi mind about
someth so i wait for an instant and he spoke
what ar we to do now where ar we to turn for help we must have
anoth transfus of blood and that soon or that poor girl life
wont be worth an hour purchas you ar exhaust alreadi i am
exhaust too i fear to trust those women even if thei would have
courag to submit what ar we to do for some on who will open hi
vein for her
what the matter with me anyhow
the voic came from the sofa across the room and it tone brought
relief and joi to my heart for thei were those of quincei morri van
hels start angrili at the first sound but hi face soften and a
glad look came into hi ey as i cri out quincei morri and
rush toward him with outstretch hand
what brought you here i cri as our hand met
i guess art is the caus
he hand me a telegram
have not heard from seward for three dai and am terribl anxiou
cannot leav father still in same condit send me word how luci is
do not delayholmwood
i think i came just in the nick of time you know you have onli to tell
me what to do
van hels strode forward and took hi hand look him straight in
the ey as he said
a brave man blood is the best thing on thi earth when a woman is in
troubl your a man and no mistak well the devil mai work against
us for all he worth but god send us men when we want them
onc again we went through that ghastli oper i have not the heart
to go through with the detail luci had got a terribl shock and it
told on her more than befor for though plenti of blood went into her
vein her bodi did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other
occas her struggl back into life wa someth fright to see
and hear howev the action of both heart and lung improv and van
hels made a subcutan inject of morphia as befor and with
good effect her faint becam a profound slumber the professor watch
whilst i went downstair with quincei morri and sent on of the maid
to pai off on of the cabmen who were wait i left quincei ly down
after have a glass of wine and told the cook to get readi a good
breakfast then a thought struck me and i went back to the room where
luci now wa when i came softli in i found van hels with a sheet or
two of notepap in hi hand he had evid read it and wa
think it over as he sat with hi hand to hi brow there wa a look
of grim satisfact in hi face as of on who ha had a doubt solv
he hand me the paper sai onli it drop from luci breast when
we carri her to the bath
when i had read it i stood look at the professor and after a paus
ask him in god name what doe it all mean wa she or is she
mad or what sort of horribl danger is it i wa so bewild that i
did not know what to sai more van hels put out hi hand and took the
paper sai
do not troubl about it now forget it for the present you shall know
and understand it all in good time but it will be later and now what
is it that you came to me to sai thi brought me back to fact and i
wa all myself again
i came to speak about the certif of death if we do not act
properli and wise there mai be an inquest and that paper would have
to be produc i am in hope that we need have no inquest for if we
had it would sure kill poor luci if noth els did i know and you
know and the other doctor who attend her know that mr westenra
had diseas of the heart and we can certifi that she di of it let us
fill up the certif at onc and i shall take it myself to the
registrar and go on to the undertak
good oh my friend john well thought of truli miss luci if she be
sad in the foe that beset her is at least happi in the friend that
love her on two three all open their vein for her besid on old
man ah ye i know friend john i am not blind i love you all the
more for it now go
in the hall i met quincei morri with a telegram for arthur tell him
that mr westenra wa dead that luci also had been ill but wa now
go on better and that van hels and i were with her i told him
where i wa go and he hurri me out but as i wa go said
when you come back jack mai i have two word with you all to
ourselv i nod in repli and went out i found no difficulti about
the registr and arrang with the local undertak to come up in
the even to measur for the coffin and to make arrang
when i got back quincei wa wait for me i told him i would see him
as soon as i knew about luci and went up to her room she wa still
sleep and the professor seemingli had not move from hi seat at her
side from hi put hi finger to hi lip i gather that he
expect her to wake befor long and wa afraid of forestal natur
so i went down to quincei and took him into the breakfastroom where
the blind were not drawn down and which wa a littl more cheer or
rather less cheerless than the other room when we were alon he said
to me
jack seward i dont want to shove myself in anywher where iv no
right to be but thi is no ordinari case you know i love that girl
and want to marri her but although that all past and gone i cant
help feel anxiou about her all the same what is it that wrong
with her the dutchmanand a fine old fellow he is i can see
thatsaid that time you two came into the room that you must have
anoth transfus of blood and that both you and he were exhaust
now i know well that you medic men speak in camera and that a man
must not expect to know what thei consult about in privat but thi is
no common matter and whatev it is i have done my part is not that
so
that so i said and he went on
i take it that both you and van hels had done alreadi what i did
todai is not that so
that so
and i guess art wa in it too when i saw him four dai ago down at hi
own place he look queer i have not seen anyth pull down so quick
sinc i wa on the pampa and had a mare that i wa fond of go to grass
all in a night on of those big bat that thei call vampir had got at
her in the night and what with hi gorg and the vein left open there
wasnt enough blood in her to let her stand up and i had to put a
bullet through her as she lai jack if you mai tell me without
betrai confid arthur wa the first is not that so as he spoke
the poor fellow look terribl anxiou he wa in a tortur of suspens
regard the woman he love and hi utter ignor of the terribl
mysteri which seem to surround her intensifi hi pain hi veri
heart wa bleed and it took all the manhood of himand there wa a
royal lot of it tooto keep him from break down i paus befor
answer for i felt that i must not betrai anyth which the
professor wish kept secret but alreadi he knew so much and guess
so much that there could be no reason for not answer so i answer
in the same phrase that so
and how long ha thi been go on
about ten dai
ten dai then i guess jack seward that that poor pretti creatur
that we all love ha had put into her vein within that time the blood
of four strong men man aliv her whole bodi wouldnt hold it then
come close to me he spoke in a fierc halfwhisp what took it
out
i shook my head that i said is the crux van hels is simpli
frantic about it and i am at my wit end i cant even hazard a guess
there ha been a seri of littl circumst which have thrown out
all our calcul as to luci be properli watch but these shall
not occur again here we stai until all be wellor ill quincei held
out hi hand count me in he said you and the dutchman will tell me
what to do and ill do it
when she woke late in the afternoon luci first movement wa to feel
in her breast and to my surpris produc the paper which van hels
had given me to read the care professor had replac it where it had
come from lest on wake she should be alarm her ey then lit on van
hels and on me too and gladden then she look around the room
and see where she wa shudder she gave a loud cry and put her
poor thin hand befor her pale face we both understood what that
meantthat she had realis to the full her mother death so we tri
what we could to comfort her doubtless sympathi eas her somewhat but
she wa veri low in thought and spirit and wept silent and weakli for
a long time we told her that either or both of us would now remain with
her all the time and that seem to comfort her toward dusk she fell
into a doze here a veri odd thing occur whilst still asleep she
took the paper from her breast and tore it in two van hels step
over and took the piec from her all the same howev she went on
with the action of tear as though the materi were still in her
hand final she lift her hand and open them as though scatter
the fragment van hels seem surpris and hi brow gather as
if in thought but he said noth
19 septemberal last night she slept fitfulli be alwai afraid
to sleep and someth weaker when she woke from it the professor and
i took it in turn to watch and we never left her for a moment
unattend quincei morri said noth about hi intent but i knew
that all night long he patrol round and round the hous
when the dai came it search light show the ravag in poor luci
strength she wa hardli abl to turn her head and the littl
nourish which she could take seem to do her no good at time she
slept and both van hels and i notic the differ in her between
sleep and wake whilst asleep she look stronger although more
haggard and her breath wa softer her open mouth show the pale
gum drawn back from the teeth which thu look posit longer and
sharper than usual when she woke the soft of her ey evid
chang the express for she look her own self although a dy
on in the afternoon she ask for arthur and we telegraph for him
quincei went off to meet him at the station
when he arriv it wa nearli six oclock and the sun wa set full
and warm and the red light stream in through the window and gave more
colour to the pale cheek when he saw her arthur wa simpli choke

face as if with violent exercis befor i could get up to him the
patient rush at them and pull on of them off the cart began to
knock hi head against the ground if i had not seiz him just at the

20 septemberonli resolut and habit can let me make an entri
tonight i am too miser too lowspirit too sick of the world
and all in it includ life itself that i would not care if i heard
thi moment the flap of the wing of the angel of death and he ha
been flap those grim wing to some purpos of lateluci mother
and arthur father and now let me get on with my work
i duli reliev van hels in hi watch over luci we want arthur to
go to rest also but he refus at first it wa onli when i told him
that we should want him to help us dure the dai and that we must not
all break down for want of rest lest luci should suffer that he agre
to go van hels wa veri kind to him come my child he said
come with me you ar sick and weak and have had much sorrow and much
mental pain as well as that tax on your strength that we know of you
must not be alon for to be alon is to be full of fear and alarm
come to the drawingroom where there is a big fire and there ar two
sofa you shall lie on on and i on the other and our sympathi will
be comfort to each other even though we do not speak and even if we
sleep arthur went off with him cast back a long look on luci
face which lai in her pillow almost whiter than the lawn she lai
quit still and i look round the room to see that all wa as it
should be i could see that the professor had carri out in thi room
as in the other hi purpos of us the garlic the whole of the
windowsash reek with it and round luci neck over the silk
handkerchief which van hels made her keep on wa a rough chaplet of
the same odor flower luci wa breath somewhat stertor and
her face wa at it worst for the open mouth show the pale gum her
teeth in the dim uncertain light seem longer and sharper than thei
had been in the morn in particular by some trick of the light the
canin teeth look longer and sharper than the rest i sat down by her
and present she move uneasili at the same moment there came a sort
of dull flap or buffet at the window i went over to it softli
and peep out by the corner of the blind there wa a full moonlight
and i could see that the nois wa made by a great bat which wheel
rounddoubtless attract by the light although so dimand everi now
and again struck the window with it wing when i came back to my seat
i found that luci had move slightli and had torn awai the garlic
flower from her throat i replac them as well as i could and sat
watch her
present she woke and i gave her food as van hels had prescrib
she took but a littl and that languidli there did not seem to be with
her now the unconsci struggl for life and strength that had hitherto
so mark her ill it struck me as curiou that the moment she
becam consciou she press the garlic flower close to her it wa
certainli odd that whenev she got into that letharg state with the
stertor breath she put the flower from her but that when she
wake she clutch them close there wa no possibl of make ani
mistak about thi for in the long hour that follow she had mani
spell of sleep and wake and repeat both action mani time
at six oclock van hels came to reliev me arthur had then fallen
into a doze and he mercifulli let him sleep on when he saw luci face
i could hear the siss indraw of hi breath and he said to me in a
sharp whisper draw up the blind i want light then he bent down
and with hi face almost touch luci examin her carefulli he
remov the flower and lift the silk handkerchief from her throat as
he did so he start back and i could hear hi ejacul mein
gott as it wa smother in hi throat i bent over and look too
and as i notic some queer chill came over me
the wound on the throat had absolut disappear
for fulli five minut van hels stood look at her with hi face
at it sternest then he turn to me and said calmli
she is dy it will not be long now it will be much differ mark
me whether she di consciou or in her sleep wake that poor boi and
let him come and see the last he trust us and we have promis him
i went to the diningroom and wake him he wa daze for a moment but
when he saw the sunlight stream in through the edg of the shutter
he thought he wa late and express hi fear i assur him that luci
wa still asleep but told him as gentli as i could that both van
hels and i fear that the end wa near he cover hi face with hi
hand and slid down on hi knee by the sofa where he remain
perhap a minut with hi head buri prai whilst hi shoulder
shook with grief i took him by the hand and rais him up come i
said my dear old fellow summon all your fortitud it will be best
and easiest for her
when we came into luci room i could see that van hels had with
hi usual forethought been put matter straight and make
everyth look as pleas as possibl he had even brush luci
hair so that it lai on the pillow in it usual sunni rippl when we
came into the room she open her ey and see him whisper
softli
arthur oh my love i am so glad you have come he wa stoop to
kiss her when van hels motion him back no he whisper not
yet hold her hand it will comfort her more
so arthur took her hand and knelt besid her and she look her best
with all the soft line match the angel beauti of her ey then
gradual her ey close and she sank to sleep for a littl bit her
breast heav softli and her breath came and went like a tire child
and then insens there came the strang chang which i had notic in
the night her breath grew stertor the mouth open and the pale
gum drawn back made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever in a
sort of sleepwak vagu unconsci wai she open her ey which
were now dull and hard at onc and said in a soft voluptu voic
such as i had never heard from her lip
arthur oh my love i am so glad you have come kiss me arthur bent
eagerli over to kiss her but at that instant van hels who like me
had been startl by her voic swoop upon him and catch him by
the neck with both hand drag him back with a furi of strength which
i never thought he could have possess and actual hurl him almost
across the room
not for your life he said not for your live soul and her and
he stood between them like a lion at bai
arthur wa so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do
or sai and befor ani impuls of violenc could seiz him he realis
the place and the occas and stood silent wait
i kept my ey fix on luci as did van hels and we saw a spasm as
of rage flit like a shadow over her face the sharp teeth champ
togeth then her ey close and she breath heavili
veri shortli after she open her ey in all their soft and
put out her poor pale thin hand took van hels great brown
on draw it to her she kiss it my true friend she said in a
faint voic but with untel patho my true friend and hi oh
guard him and give me peac
i swear it he said solemnli kneel besid her and hold up hi
hand as on who regist an oath then he turn to arthur and said
to him come my child take her hand in your and kiss her on the
forehead and onli onc
their ey met instead of their lip and so thei part
luci ey close and van hels who had been watch close took
arthur arm and drew him awai
and then luci breath becam stertor again and all at onc it
ceas
it is all over said van hels she is dead
i took arthur by the arm and led him awai to the drawingroom where he
sat down and cover hi face with hi hand sob in a wai that
nearli broke me down to see
i went back to the room and found van hels look at poor luci and
hi face wa sterner than ever some chang had come over her bodi
death had given back part of her beauti for her brow and cheek had
recov some of their flow line even the lip had lost their
deadli pallor it wa as if the blood no longer need for the work
of the heart had gone to make the harsh of death as littl rude as
might be
we thought her dy whilst she slept
and sleep when she di
i stood besid van hels and said
ah well poor girl there is peac for her at last it is the end
he turn to me and said with grave solemn
not so ala not so it is onli the begin

the forenoon wa a dreari time but at noon the solicitor came mr
marquand of wholeman son marquand lidderdal he wa veri genial
and veri appreci of what we had done and took off our hand all
care as to detail dure lunch he told us that mr westenra had for
some time expect sudden death from her heart and had put her affair
in absolut order he inform us that with the except of a certain
entail properti of luci father which now in default of direct
issu went back to a distant branch of the famili the whole estat
real and person wa left absolut to arthur holmwood when he had
told us so much he went on
frankli we did our best to prevent such a testamentari disposit and
point out certain conting that might leav her daughter either
penniless or not so free as she should be to act regard a matrimoni
allianc inde we press the matter so far that we almost came into
collis for she ask us if we were or were not prepar to carri out
her wish of cours we had then no altern but to accept we were
right in principl and ninetynin time out of a hundr we should
have prove by the logic of event the accuraci of our judgment
frankli howev i must admit that in thi case ani other form of
disposit would have render imposs the carri out of her
wish for by her predeceas her daughter the latter would have come
into possess of the properti and even had she onli surviv her
mother by five minut her properti would in case there were no
willand a will wa a practic imposs in such a casehav been
treat at her deceas as under intestaci in which case lord godalm
though so dear a friend would have had no claim in the world and the
inheritor be remot would not be like to abandon their just
right for sentiment reason regard an entir stranger i assur
you my dear sir i am rejoic at the result perfectli rejoic
he wa a good fellow but hi rejoic at the on littl partin which
he wa offici interestedof so great a tragedi wa an
objectlesson in the limit of sympathet understand
he did not remain long but said he would look in later in the dai and
see lord godalm hi come howev had been a certain comfort to
us sinc it assur us that we should not have to dread hostil
critic as to ani of our act arthur wa expect at five oclock so
a littl befor that time we visit the deathchamb it wa so in
veri truth for now both mother and daughter lai in it the undertak
true to hi craft had made the best displai he could of hi good and
there wa a mortuari air about the place that lower our spirit at
onc van hels order the former arrang to be adher to
explain that as lord godalm wa come veri soon it would be
less harrow to hi feel to see all that wa left of hi fianc
quit alon the undertak seem shock at hi own stupid and
exert himself to restor thing to the condit in which we left them
the night befor so that when arthur came such shock to hi feel
as we could avoid were save
poor fellow he look desper sad and broken even hi stalwart
manhood seem to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of hi
muchtri emot he had i knew been veri genuin and devotedli
attach to hi father and to lose him and at such a time wa a
bitter blow to him with me he wa warm as ever and to van hels he
wa sweetli courteou but i could not help see that there wa some
constraint with him the professor notic it too and motion me to
bring him upstair i did so and left him at the door of the room as i
felt he would like to be quit alon with her but he took my arm and
led me in sai huskili
you love her too old fellow she told me all about it and there wa
no friend had a closer place in her heart than you i dont know how to
thank you for all you have done for her i cant think yet
here he suddenli broke down and threw hi arm round my shoulder and
laid hi head on my breast cry
oh jack jack what shall i do the whole of life seem gone from me
all at onc and there is noth in the wide world for me to live for
i comfort him as well as i could in such case men do not need much
express a grip of the hand the tighten of an arm over the
shoulder a sob in unison ar express of sympathi dear to a man
heart i stood still and silent till hi sob di awai and then i said
softli to him
come and look at her
togeth we move over to the bed and i lift the lawn from her face
god how beauti she wa everi hour seem to be enhanc her
loveli it frighten and amaz me somewhat and as for arthur he
fell atrembl and final wa shaken with doubt as with an agu at
last after a long paus he said to me in a faint whisper
jack is she realli dead
i assur him sadli that it wa so and went on to suggestfor i felt
that such a horribl doubt should not have life for a moment longer than
i could helpthat it often happen that after death face becam
soften and even resolv into their youth beauti that thi wa
especi so when death had been preced by ani acut or prolong
suffer it seem to quit do awai with ani doubt and after
kneel besid the couch for a while and look at her lovingli and
long he turn asid i told him that that must be goodby as the
coffin had to be prepar so he went back and took her dead hand in hi

hi repli wa in a wai characterist of him for it wa logic and
forc and mysteri he said
ah you dont comprehend friend john do not think that i am not sad

at such moment king laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear
here i am here i am till the blood come danc back and bring some of
the sunshin that he carri with him to my cheek oh friend john it is
a strang world a sad world a world full of miseri and woe and

i did not like to wound him by pretend not to see hi idea but as i
did not yet understand the caus of hi laughter i ask him as he
answer me hi face grew stern and he said in quit a differ
tone
oh it wa the grim ironi of it allthi so love ladi garland with
flower that look so fair as life till on by on we wonder if she
were truli dead she laid in that so fine marbl hous in that lone
churchyard where rest so mani of her kin laid there with the mother
who love her and whom she love and that sacr bell go toll
toll toll so sad and slow and those holi men with the white
garment of the angel pretend to read book and yet all the time
their ey never on the page and all of us with the bow head and all
for what she is dead so is it not
well for the life of me professor i said i cant see anyth to
laugh at in all that why your explan make it a harder puzzl
than befor but even if the burial servic wa comic what about poor
art and hi troubl why hi heart wa simpli break
just so said he not that the transfus of hi blood to her vein had
made her truli hi bride
ye and it wa a sweet and comfort idea for him
quit so but there wa a difficulti friend john if so that then
what about the other ho ho then thi so sweet maid is a polyandrist
and me with my poor wife dead to me but aliv by church law though
no wit all goneeven i who am faith husband to thi nownowif
am bigamist
i dont see where the joke come in there either i said and i did
not feel particularli pleas with him for sai such thing he laid
hi hand on my arm and said
friend john forgiv me if i pain i show not my feel to other
when it would wound but onli to you my old friend whom i can trust
if you could have look into my veri heart then when i want to laugh
if you could have done so when the laugh arriv if you could do so
now when king laugh have pack up hi crown and all that is to himfor
he go far far awai from me and for a long long timemayb you would
perhap piti me the most of all
i wa touch by the tender of hi tone and ask why
becaus i know

sit over our roof with brood wing luci li in the tomb of her
kin a lordli deathhous in a lone churchyard awai from teem
london where the air is fresh and the sun rise over hampstead hill
and where wild flower grow of their own accord
so i can finish thi diari and god onli know if i shall ever begin
anoth if i do or if i even open thi again it will be to deal with
differ peopl and differ theme for here at the end where the
romanc of my life is told er i go back to take up the thread of my

go on with the same record until thi afternoon i had no caus to
think of what is done renfield had becom to all intent as sane as
he ever wa he wa alreadi well ahead with hi fly busi and he had
just start in the spider line also so he had not been of ani troubl
to me i had a letter from arthur written on sundai and from it i
gather that he is bear up wonderfulli well quincei morri is with
him and that is much of a help for he himself is a bubbl well of
good spirit quincei wrote me a line too and from him i hear that
arthur is begin to recov someth of hi old buoyanc so as to
them all my mind is at rest as for myself i wa settl down to my
work with the enthusiasm which i us to have for it so that i might
fairli have said that the wound which poor luci left on me wa becom
cicatris everyth is howev now reopen and what is to be the
end god onli know i have an idea that van hels think he know
too but he will onli let out enough at a time to whet curios he
went to exet yesterdai and stai there all night todai he came
back and almost bound into the room at about halfpast five oclock
and thrust last night westminst gazett into my hand
what do you think of that he ask as he stood back and fold hi
arm
i look over the paper for i realli did not know what he meant but he
took it from me and point out a paragraph about children be decoi
awai at hampstead it did not convei much to me until i reach a
passag where it describ small punctur wound on their throat an
idea struck me and i look up well he said
it is like poor luci
and what do you make of it
simpli that there is some caus in common whatev it wa that injur
her ha injur them i did not quit understand hi answer
that is true indirectli but not directli
how do you mean professor i ask i wa a littl inclin to take
hi serious lightlyfor after all four dai of rest and freedom
from burn harrow anxieti doe help to restor on spiritsbut
when i saw hi face it sober me never even in the midst of our
despair about poor luci had he look more stern
tell me i said i can hazard no opinion i do not know what to
think and i have no data on which to found a conjectur
do you mean to tell me friend john that you have no suspicion as to
what poor luci di of not after all the hint given not onli by
event but by me
of nervou prostrat follow on great loss or wast of blood
and how the blood lost or wast i shook my head he step over and
sat down besid me and went on
you ar clever man friend john you reason well and your wit is bold
but you ar too prejud you do not let your ey see nor your ear
hear and that which is outsid your daili life is not of account to
you do you not think that there ar thing which you cannot understand
and yet which ar that some peopl see thing that other cannot but
there ar thing old and new which must not be contempl by men
ey becaus thei knowor think thei knowsom thing which other men
have told them ah it is the fault of our scienc that it want to
explain all and if it explain not then it sai there is noth to
explain but yet we see around us everi dai the growth of new belief
which think themselv new and which ar yet but the old which pretend
to be younglik the fine ladi at the opera i suppos now you do not
believ in corpor transfer no nor in materialis no nor
in astral bodi no nor in the read of thought no nor in
hypnot
ye i said charcot ha prove that pretti well he smile as he
went on then you ar satisfi as to it ye and of cours then you
understand how it act and can follow the mind of the great
charcotala that he is no moreinto the veri soul of the patient
that he influenc no then friend john am i to take it that you
simpli accept fact and ar satisfi to let from premis to conclus
be a blank no then tell mefor i am student of the brainhow you
accept the hypnot and reject the thought read let me tell you my
friend that there ar thing done todai in electr scienc which
would have been deem unholi by the veri men who discov
electricitywho would themselv not so long befor have been burn
as wizard there ar alwai mysteri in life why wa it that
methuselah live nine hundr year and old parr on hundr and
sixtynin and yet that poor luci with four men blood in her poor
vein could not live even on dai for had she live on more dai we
could have save her do you know all the mysteri of life and death do
you know the altogeth of compar anatomi and can sai wherefor the
qualiti of brute ar in some men and not in other can you tell me
why when other spider die small and soon that on great spider live
for centuri in the tower of the old spanish church and grew and grew
till on descend he could drink the oil of all the church lamp can
you tell me why in the pampa ay and elsewher there ar bat that
come at night and open the vein of cattl and hors and suck dry their
vein how in some island of the western sea there ar bat which hang
on the tree all dai and those who have seen describ as like giant
nut or pod and that when the sailor sleep on the deck becaus that
it is hot flit down on them and thenand then in the morn ar
found dead men white as even miss luci wa
good god professor i said start up do you mean to tell me that
luci wa bitten by such a bat and that such a thing is here in london
in the nineteenth centuri he wave hi hand for silenc and went
on
can you tell me why the tortois live more long than gener of
men why the eleph goe on and on till he have seen dynasti and
why the parrot never die onli of bite of cat or dog or other complaint
can you tell me why men believ in all ag and place that there ar
some few who live on alwai if thei be permit that there ar men and
women who cannot die we all knowbecaus scienc ha vouch for the
factthat there have been toad shut up in rock for thousand of
year shut in on so small hole that onli hold him sinc the youth of
the world can you tell me how the indian fakir can make himself to die
and have been buri and hi grave seal and corn sow on it and the
corn reap and be cut and sown and reap and cut again and then men
come and take awai the unbroken seal and that there lie the indian
fakir not dead but that rise up and walk amongst them as befor here
i interrupt him i wa get bewild he so crowd on my mind
hi list of natur eccentr and possibl imposs that my
imagin wa get fire i had a dim idea that he wa teach me
some lesson as long ago he us to do in hi studi at amsterdam but
he us then to tell me the thing so that i could have the object of
thought in mind all the time but now i wa without thi help yet i
want to follow him so i said
professor let me be your pet student again tell me the thesi so
that i mai appli your knowledg as you go on at present i am go in
my mind from point to point as a mad man and not a sane on follow an
idea i feel like a novic lumber through a bog in a mist jump
from on tussock to anoth in the mere blind effort to move on without
know where i am go
that is good imag he said well i shall tell you my thesi is
thi i want you to believ
to believ what
to believ in thing that you cannot let me illustr i heard onc
of an american who so defin faith that faculti which enabl us to
believ thing which we know to be untru for on i follow that man
he meant that we shall have an open mind and not let a littl bit of
truth check the rush of a big truth like a small rock doe a railwai
truck we get the small truth first good we keep him and we valu
him but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in
the univers
then you want me not to let some previou convict injur the
recept of my mind with regard to some strang matter do i read
your lesson aright
ah you ar my favourit pupil still it is worth to teach you now
that you ar will to understand you have taken the first step to
understand you think then that those so small hole in the children
throat were made by the same that made the hole in miss luci
i suppos so he stood up and said solemnli
then you ar wrong oh would it were so but ala no it is wors
far far wors
in god name professor van hels what do you mean i cri
he threw himself with a despair gestur into a chair and place hi
elbow on the tabl cover hi face with hi hand as he spoke
thei were made by miss luci
chapter xv
dr seward diarycontinu
for a while sheer anger master me it wa as if he had dure her life
struck luci on the face i smote the tabl hard and rose up as i said to
him
dr van hels ar you mad he rais hi head and look at me and
somehow the tender of hi face calm me at onc would i were he
said mad were easi to bear compar with truth like thi oh my
friend why think you did i go so far round why take so long to tell
you so simpl a thing wa it becaus i hate you and have hate you all
my life wa it becaus i wish to give you pain wa it that i want
now so late reveng for that time when you save my life and from a
fear death ah no
forgiv me said i he went on
my friend it wa becaus i wish to be gentl in the break to you
for i know you have love that so sweet ladi but even yet i do not
expect you to believ it is so hard to accept at onc ani abstract
truth that we mai doubt such to be possibl when we have alwai
believ the no of it it is more hard still to accept so sad a
concret truth and of such a on as miss luci tonight i go to prove
it dare you come with me
thi stagger me a man doe not like to prove such a truth byron
except from the categori jealousi
and prove the veri truth he most abhor
he saw my hesit and spoke
the logic is simpl no madman logic thi time jump from tussock
to tussock in a misti bog if it be not true then proof will be relief
at worst it will not harm if it be true ah there is the dread yet
veri dread should help my caus for in it is some need of belief come
i tell you what i propos first that we go off now and see that child
in the hospit dr vincent of the north hospit where the paper
sai the child is is friend of mine and i think of your sinc you were
in class at amsterdam he will let two scientist see hi case if he
will not let two friend we shall tell him noth but onli that we
wish to learn and then
and then he took a kei from hi pocket and held it up and then we
spend the night you and i in the churchyard where luci li thi is
the kei that lock the tomb i had it from the coffinman to give to
arthur my heart sank within me for i felt that there wa some fear
ordeal befor us i could do noth howev so i pluck up what
heart i could and said that we had better hasten as the afternoon wa
pass
we found the child awak it had had a sleep and taken some food and
altogeth wa go on well dr vincent took the bandag from it
throat and show us the punctur there wa no mistak the
similar to those which had been on luci throat thei were smaller
and the edg look fresher that wa all we ask vincent to what he
attribut them and he repli that it must have been a bite of some
anim perhap a rat but for hi own part he wa inclin to think
that it wa on of the bat which ar so numer on the northern
height of london out of so mani harmless on he said there mai
be some wild specimen from the south of a more malign speci some
sailor mai have brought on home and it manag to escap or even from
the zolog garden a young on mai have got loos or on be bred
there from a vampir these thing do occur you know onli ten dai ago
a wolf got out and wa i believ trace up in thi direct for a
week after the children were plai noth but red ride hood on the
heath and in everi allei in the place until thi bloofer ladi scare
came along sinc when it ha been quit a galatim with them even
thi poor littl mite when he woke up todai ask the nurs if he
might go awai when she ask him why he want to go he said he want
to plai with the bloofer ladi
i hope said van hels that when you ar send the child home
you will caution it parent to keep strict watch over it these fanci
to strai ar most danger and if the child were to remain out anoth
night it would probabl be fatal but in ani case i suppos you will
not let it awai for some dai
certainli not not for a week at least longer if the wound is not
heal
our visit to the hospit took more time than we had reckon on and
the sun had dip befor we came out when van hels saw how dark it
wa he said
there is no hurri it is more late than i thought come let us seek
somewher that we mai eat and then we shall go on our wai
we dine at jack straw castl along with a littl crowd of
bicyclist and other who were genial noisi about ten oclock we
start from the inn it wa then veri dark and the scatter lamp
made the dark greater when we were onc outsid their individu
radiu the professor had evid note the road we were to go for he
went on unhesitatingli but as for me i wa in quit a mixup as to
local as we went further we met fewer and fewer peopl till at
last we were somewhat surpris when we met even the patrol of hors
polic go their usual suburban round at last we reach the wall of
the churchyard which we climb over with some littl difficultyfor
it wa veri dark and the whole place seem so strang to usw found
the westenra tomb the professor took the kei open the creaki door
and stand back polit but quit unconsci motion me to
preced him there wa a delici ironi in the offer in the
courtli of give prefer on such a ghastli occas my
companion follow me quickli and cautious drew the door to after
carefulli ascertain that the lock wa a fall and not a spring
on in the latter case we should have been in a bad plight then he
fumbl in hi bag and take out a matchbox and a piec of candl
proceed to make a light the tomb in the daytim and when wreath
with fresh flower had look grim and gruesom enough but now some
dai afterward when the flower hung lank and dead their white
turn to rust and their green to brown when the spider and the
beetl had resum their accustom domin when timediscolour
stone and dustencrust mortar and rusti dank iron and tarnish
brass and cloud silverpl gave back the feebl glimmer of a
candl the effect wa more miser and sordid than could have been
imagin it convei irresist the idea that lifeanim lifewa
not the onli thing which could pass awai
van hels went about hi work systemat hold hi candl so
that he could read the coffin plate and so hold it that the sperm
drop in white patch which congeal as thei touch the metal he
made assur of luci coffin anoth search in hi bag and he took
out a turnscrew
what ar you go to do i ask
to open the coffin you shall yet be convinc straightwai he began
take out the screw and final lift off the lid show the
case of lead beneath the sight wa almost too much for me it seem
to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have
strip off her cloth in her sleep whilst live i actual took
hold of hi hand to stop him he onli said you shall see and again
fumbl in hi bag took out a tini fretsaw strike the turnscrew
through the lead with a swift downward stab which made me winc he
made a small hole which wa howev big enough to admit the point of
the saw i had expect a rush of ga from the weekold corps we
doctor who have had to studi our danger have to becom accustom to
such thing and i drew back toward the door but the professor never
stop for a moment he saw down a coupl of feet along on side of
the lead coffin and then across and down the other side take the
edg of the loos flang he bent it back toward the foot of the
coffin and hold up the candl into the apertur motion to me to
look
i drew near and look the coffin wa empti
it wa certainli a surpris to me and gave me a consider shock but
van hels wa unmov he wa now more sure than ever of hi ground
and so embolden to proce in hi task ar you satisfi now friend
john he ask
i felt all the dog argument of my natur awak within me as
i answer him
i am satisfi that luci bodi is not in that coffin but that onli
prove on thing
and what is that friend john
that it is not there
that is good logic he said so far as it goe but how do youhow
can youaccount for it not be there
perhap a bodysnatch i suggest some of the undertak peopl
mai have stolen it i felt that i wa speak folli and yet it wa
the onli real caus which i could suggest the professor sigh ah
well he said we must have more proof come with me
he put on the coffinlid again gather up all hi thing and place
them in the bag blew out the light and place the candl also in the
bag we open the door and went out behind us he close the door and
lock it he hand me the kei sai will you keep it you had
better be assur i laughedit wa not a veri cheer laugh i am
bound to saya i motion him to keep it a kei is noth i said
there mai be duplic and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock
of that kind he said noth but put the kei in hi pocket then he
told me to watch at on side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at
the other i took up my place behind a yewtre and i saw hi dark
figur move until the interven headston and tree hid it from my
sight
it wa a lone vigil just after i had taken my place i heard a distant
clock strike twelv and in time came on and two i wa chill and
unnerv and angri with the professor for take me on such an errand
and with myself for come i wa too cold and too sleepi to be keenli
observ and not sleepi enough to betrai my trust so altogeth i had
a dreari miser time
suddenli as i turn round i thought i saw someth like a white
streak move between two dark yewtre at the side of the churchyard
farthest from the tomb at the same time a dark mass move from the
professor side of the ground and hurriedli went toward it then i
too move but i had to go round headston and railedoff tomb and i
stumbl over grave the sky wa overcast and somewher far off an
earli cock crew a littl wai off beyond a line of scatter
junipertre which mark the pathwai to the church a white dim
figur flit in the direct of the tomb the tomb itself wa hidden
by tree and i could not see where the figur disappear i heard the
rustl of actual movement where i had first seen the white figur and
come over found the professor hold in hi arm a tini child when
he saw me he held it out to me and said
ar you satisfi now
no i said in a wai that i felt wa aggress
do you not see the child
ye it is a child but who brought it here and is it wound i
ask
we shall see said the professor and with on impuls we took our wai
out of the churchyard he carri the sleep child
when we had got some littl distanc awai we went into a clump of
tree and struck a match and look at the child throat it wa
without a scratch or scar of ani kind
wa i right i ask triumphantli
we were just in time said the professor thankfulli
we had now to decid what we were to do with the child and so consult
about it if we were to take it to a policest we should have to
give some account of our movement dure the night at least we should
have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child
so final we decid that we would take it to the heath and when we
heard a policeman come would leav it where he could not fail to find
it we would then seek our wai home as quickli as we could all fell out
well at the edg of hampstead heath we heard a policeman heavi
tramp and lai the child on the pathwai we wait and watch until
he saw it as he flash hi lantern to and fro we heard hi exclam
of astonish and then we went awai silent by good chanc we got a
cab near the spaniard and drove to town
i cannot sleep so i make thi entri but i must try to get a few hour
sleep as van hels is to call for me at noon he insist that i shall
go with him on anoth expedit
27 septemberit wa two oclock befor we found a suitabl
opportun for our attempt the funer held at noon wa all complet
and the last straggler of the mourner had taken themselv lazili
awai when look carefulli from behind a clump of aldertre we saw
the sexton lock the gate after him we knew then that we were safe till
morn did we desir it but the professor told me that we should not
want more than an hour at most again i felt that horrid sens of the
realiti of thing in which ani effort of imagin seem out of
place and i realis distinctli the peril of the law which we were
incur in our unhallow work besid i felt it wa all so useless
outrag as it wa to open a leaden coffin to see if a woman dead
nearli a week were realli dead it now seem the height of folli to
open the tomb again when we knew from the evid of our own
eyesight that the coffin wa empti i shrug my shoulder howev
and rest silent for van hels had a wai of go on hi own road
no matter who remonstr he took the kei open the vault and again
courteous motion me to preced the place wa not so gruesom as
last night but oh how unutter meanlook when the sunshin
stream in van hels walk over to luci coffin and i follow
he bent over and again forc back the leaden flang and then a shock
of surpris and dismai shot through me
there lai luci seemingli just as we had seen her the night befor her
funer she wa if possibl more radiantli beauti than ever and i
could not believ that she wa dead the lip were red nai redder than
befor and on the cheek wa a delic bloom
is thi a juggl i said to him
ar you convinc now said the professor in respons and as he spoke
he put over hi hand and in a wai that made me shudder pull back the
dead lip and show the white teeth
see he went on see thei ar even sharper than befor with thi
and thisand he touch on of the canin teeth and that below
itth littl children can be bitten ar you of belief now friend
john onc more argument hostil woke within me i could not
accept such an overwhelm idea as he suggest so with an attempt to
argu of which i wa even at the moment asham i said
she mai have been place here sinc last night
inde that is so and by whom
i do not know some on ha done it
and yet she ha been dead on week most peopl in that time would not
look so i had no answer for thi so wa silent van hels did not
seem to notic my silenc at ani rate he show neither chagrin nor
triumph he wa look intent at the face of the dead woman rais
the eyelid and look at the ey and onc more open the lip and
examin the teeth then he turn to me and said
here there is on thing which is differ from all record here is
some dual life that is not as the common she wa bitten by the vampir
when she wa in a tranc sleepwalkingoh you start you do not know
that friend john but you shall know it all laterand in tranc could
he best come to take more blood in tranc she di and in tranc she
is undead too so it is that she differ from all other usual when
the undead sleep at homea he spoke he made a comprehens sweep of
hi arm to design what to a vampir wa hometheir face show what
thei ar but thi so sweet that wa when she not undead she go back to
the noth of the common dead there is no malign there see and so
it make hard that i must kill her in her sleep thi turn my blood
cold and it began to dawn upon me that i wa accept van hels
theori but if she were realli dead what wa there of terror in the
idea of kill her he look up at me and evid saw the chang in
my face for he said almost joyous
ah you believ now
i answer do not press me too hard all at onc i am will to
accept how will you do thi bloodi work
i shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic and i shall
drive a stake through her bodi it made me shudder to think of so
mutil the bodi of the woman whom i had love and yet the feel
wa not so strong as i had expect i wa in fact begin to
shudder at the presenc of thi be thi undead as van hels
call it and to loath it is it possibl that love is all subject
or all object
i wait a consider time for van hels to begin but he stood as
if wrap in thought present he close the catch of hi bag with a
snap and said
i have been think and have made up my mind as to what is best if i
did simpli follow my inclin i would do now at thi moment what is
to be done but there ar other thing to follow and thing that ar
thousand time more difficult in that them we do not know thi is
simpl she have yet no life taken though that is of time and to act
now would be to take danger from her for ever but then we mai have to
want arthur and how shall we tell him of thi if you who saw the
wound on luci throat and saw the wound so similar on the child at
the hospit if you who saw the coffin empti last night and full
todai with a woman who have not chang onli to be more rose and more
beauti in a whole week after she dieif you know of thi and know
of the white figur last night that brought the child to the churchyard
and yet of your own sens you did not believ how then can i expect
arthur who know none of those thing to believ he doubt me when i
took him from her kiss when she wa dy i know he ha forgiven me
becaus in some mistaken idea i have done thing that prevent him sai
goodby as he ought and he mai think that in some more mistaken idea
thi woman wa buri aliv and that in most mistak of all we have
kill her he will then argu back that it is we mistaken on that
have kill her by our idea and so he will be much unhappi alwai yet
he never can be sure and that is the worst of all and he will
sometim think that she he love wa buri aliv and that will paint
hi dream with horror of what she must have suffer and again he
will think that we mai be right and that hi so belov wa after all
an undead no i told him onc and sinc then i learn much now sinc
i know it is all true a hundr thousand time more do i know that he
must pass through the bitter water to reach the sweet he poor fellow
must have on hour that will make the veri face of heaven grow black to
him then we can act for good all round and send him peac my mind is
made up let us go you return home for tonight to your asylum and see
that all be well as for me i shall spend the night here in thi
churchyard in my own wai tomorrow night you will come to me to the
berkelei hotel at ten of the clock i shall send for arthur to come too
and also that so fine young man of america that gave hi blood later we
shall all have work to do i come with you so far as piccadilli and
there dine for i must be back here befor the sun set
so we lock the tomb and came awai and got over the wall of the
churchyard which wa not much of a task and drove back to piccadilli

28 septemberit is wonder what a good night sleep will do for
on yesterdai i wa almost will to accept van hels monstrou
idea but now thei seem to start out lurid befor me as outrag on
common sens i have no doubt that he believ it all i wonder if hi
mind can have becom in ani wai unhing sure there must be some
ration explan of all these mysteri thing is it possibl that
the professor can have done it himself he is so abnorm clever that
if he went off hi head he would carri out hi intent with regard to
some fix idea in a wonder wai i am loath to think it and inde
it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that van
hels wa mad but anyhow i shall watch him carefulli i mai get some
light on the mysteri
29 septemb morn last night at a littl befor ten oclock
arthur and quincei came into van hels room he told us all that he
want us to do but especi address himself to arthur as if all
our will were centr in hi he began by sai that he hope we would
all come with him too for he said there is a grave duti to be done

directli address to lord godalm
i wa it rather upset me for a bit there ha been so much troubl
around my hous of late that i could do without ani more i have been
curiou too as to what you mean quincei and i talk it over but the
more we talk the more puzzl we got till now i can sai for myself
that im about up a tree as to ani mean about anyth

oh said the professor then you ar nearer the begin both of
you than friend john here who ha to go a long wai back befor he can
even get so far as to begin

mind without my sai a word then turn to the other two he said
with intens graviti
i want your permiss to do what i think good thi night it is i
know much to ask and when you know what it is i propos to do you will
know and onli then how much therefor mai i ask that you promis me
in the dark so that afterward though you mai be angri with me for a
timei must not disguis from myself the possibl that such mai
beyou shall not blame yourselv for anyth

i dont quit see hi drift but i swear he honest and that good
enough for me
i thank you sir said van hels proudli i have done myself the
honour of count you on trust friend and such endors is dear
to me he held out a hand which quincei took
then arthur spoke out
dr van hels i dont quit like to bui a pig in a poke as thei
sai in scotland and if it be anyth in which my honour as a gentleman
or my faith as a christian is concern i cannot make such a promis
if you can assur me that what you intend doe not violat either of
these two then i give my consent at onc though for the life of me i
cannot understand what you ar drive at
i accept your limit said van hels and all i ask of you is
that if you feel it necessari to condemn ani act of mine you will first
consid it well and be satisfi that it doe not violat your
reserv
agre said arthur that is onli fair and now that the
pourparl ar over mai i ask what it is we ar to do
i want you to come with me and to come in secret to the churchyard at
kingstead
arthur face fell as he said in an amaz sort of wai
where poor luci is buri the professor bow arthur went on and
when there
to enter the tomb arthur stood up
professor ar you in earnest or it is some monstrou joke pardon me
i see that you ar in earnest he sat down again but i could see that
he sat firmli and proudli as on who is on hi digniti there wa
silenc until he ask again

patient in all thing that ar reason but in thisthi desecr
of the graveof on who he fairli choke with indign the
professor look pityingli at him
if i could spare you on pang my poor friend he said god know i
would but thi night our feet must tread in thorni path or later and
for ever the feet you love must walk in path of flame
arthur look up with set white face and said
take care sir take care
would it not be well to hear what i have to sai said van hels
and then you will at least know the limit of my purpos shall i go
on
that fair enough broke in morri
after a paus van hels went on evid with an effort
miss luci is dead is it not so ye then there can be no wrong to
her but if she be not dead
arthur jump to hi feet
good god he cri what do you mean ha there been ani mistak ha
she been buri aliv he groan in anguish that not even hope could
soften
i did not sai she wa aliv my child i did not think it i go no
further than to sai that she might be undead

is it
there ar mysteri which men can onli guess at which ag by ag thei
mai solv onli in part believ me we ar now on the verg of on but

heaven and earth no cri arthur in a storm of passion not for
the wide world will i consent to ani mutil of her dead bodi dr
van hels you try me too far what have i done to you that you should
tortur me so what did that poor sweet girl do that you should want to
cast such dishonour on her grave ar you mad to speak such thing or
am i mad to listen to them dont dare to think more of such a
desecr i shall not give my consent to anyth you do i have a
duti to do in protect her grave from outrag and by god i shall do

van hels rose up from where he had all the time been seat and
said grave and sternli

by it he took the old man hand and said in a broken voic
oh it is hard to think of it and i cannot understand but at least i
shall go with you and wait
chapter xvi
dr seward diarycontinu
it wa just a quarter befor twelv oclock when we got into the
churchyard over the low wall the night wa dark with occasion gleam
of moonlight between the rent of the heavi cloud that scud across
the sky we all kept somehow close togeth with van hels slightli
in front as he led the wai when we had come close to the tomb i look
well at arthur for i fear that the proxim to a place laden with so
sorrow a memori would upset him but he bore himself well i took it
that the veri mysteri of the proceed wa in some wai a counteract
to hi grief the professor unlock the door and see a natur
hesit amongst us for variou reason solv the difficulti by
enter first himself the rest of us follow and he close the door
he then lit a dark lantern and point to the coffin arthur step
forward hesitatingli van hels said to me
you were with me here yesterdai wa the bodi of miss luci in that
coffin
it wa the professor turn to the rest sai
you hear and yet there is no on who doe not believ with me he
took hi screwdriv and again took off the lid of the coffin arthur
look on veri pale but silent when the lid wa remov he step
forward he evid did not know that there wa a leaden coffin or
at ani rate had not thought of it when he saw the rent in the lead
the blood rush to hi face for an instant but as quickli fell awai
again so that he remain of a ghastli white he wa still silent
van hels forc back the leaden flang and we all look in and
recoil
the coffin wa empti
for sever minut no on spoke a word the silenc wa broken by
quincei morri
professor i answer for you your word is all i want i wouldnt ask
such a thing ordinarilyi wouldnt so dishonour you as to impli a
doubt but thi is a mysteri that goe beyond ani honour or dishonour
is thi your do
i swear to you by all that i hold sacr that i have not remov nor
touch her what happen wa thi two night ago my friend seward and
i came herewith good purpos believ me i open that coffin which
wa then seal up and we found it as now empti we then wait and
saw someth white come through the tree the next dai we came here in
daytim and she lai there did she not friend john
ye
that night we were just in time on more so small child wa miss
and we find it thank god unharm amongst the grave yesterdai i came
here befor sundown for at sundown the undead can move i wait here
all the night till the sun rose but i saw noth it wa most probabl
that it wa becaus i had laid over the clamp of those door garlic
which the undead cannot bear and other thing which thei shun last
night there wa no exodu so tonight befor the sundown i took awai my
garlic and other thing and so it is we find thi coffin empti but
bear with me so far there is much that is strang wait you with me
outsid unseen and unheard and thing much stranger ar yet to be
soher he shut the dark slide of hi lanternnow to the outsid
he open the door and we file out he come last and lock the
door behind him
oh but it seem fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of
that vault how sweet it wa to see the cloud race by and the pass
gleam of the moonlight between the scud cloud cross and
passinglik the glad and sorrow of a man life how sweet it wa
to breath the fresh air that had no taint of death and decai how
humanis to see the red light of the sky beyond the hill and to
hear far awai the muffl roar that mark the life of a great citi each
in hi own wai wa solemn and overcom arthur wa silent and wa i
could see strive to grasp the purpos and the inner mean of the
mysteri i wa myself toler patient and half inclin again to
throw asid doubt and to accept van hels conclus quincei
morri wa phlegmat in the wai of a man who accept all thing and
accept them in the spirit of cool braveri with hazard of all he ha to
stake not be abl to smoke he cut himself a goodsiz plug of
tobacco and began to chew as to van hels he wa emploi in a
definit wai first he took from hi bag a mass of what look like
thin waferlik biscuit which wa carefulli roll up in a white
napkin next he took out a doublehand of some whitish stuff like
dough or putti he crumbl the wafer up fine and work it into the
mass between hi hand thi he then took and roll it into thin
strip began to lai them into the crevic between the door and it
set in the tomb i wa somewhat puzzl at thi and be close
ask him what it wa that he wa do arthur and quincei drew near
also as thei too were curiou he answer
i am close the tomb so that the undead mai not enter
and is that stuff you have put there go to do it ask quincei
great scott is thi a game
it is
what is that which you ar us thi time the question wa by
arthur van hels rever lift hi hat as he answer
the host i brought it from amsterdam i have an indulg it wa an
answer that appal the most sceptic of us and we felt individu
that in the presenc of such earnest purpos as the professor a
purpos which could thu us the to him most sacr of thing it wa
imposs to distrust in respect silenc we took the place
assign to us close round the tomb but hidden from the sight of ani
on approach i piti the other especi arthur i had myself
been apprent by my former visit to thi watch horror and yet i
who had up to an hour ago repudi the proof felt my heart sink
within me never did tomb look so ghastli white never did cypress or
yew or junip so seem the embodi of funer gloom never did tree
or grass wave or rustl so omin never did bough creak so
mysteri and never did the farawai howl of dog send such a
woeful presag through the night
there wa a long spell of silenc a big ach void and then from the
professor a keen ssss he point and far down the avenu of yew
we saw a white figur advancea dim white figur which held someth
dark at it breast the figur stop and at the moment a rai of
moonlight fell upon the mass of drive cloud and show in startl
promin a darkhair woman dress in the cerement of the grave
we could not see the face for it wa bent down over what we saw to be a
fairhair child there wa a paus and a sharp littl cry such as a
child give in sleep or a dog as it li befor the fire and dream we
were start forward but the professor warn hand seen by us as
he stood behind a yewtre kept us back and then as we look the
white figur move forward again it wa now near enough for us to see
clearli and the moonlight still held my own heart grew cold as ic
and i could hear the gasp of arthur as we recognis the featur of
luci westenra luci westenra but yet how chang the sweet wa
turn to adamantin heartless cruelti and the puriti to voluptu
wanton van hels step out and obedi to hi gestur we
all advanc too the four of us rang in a line befor the door of the
tomb van hels rais hi lantern and drew the slide by the
concentr light that fell on luci face we could see that the lip
were crimson with fresh blood and that the stream had trickl over her
chin and stain the puriti of her lawn deathrob
we shudder with horror i could see by the tremul light that even
van hels iron nerv had fail arthur wa next to me and if i had
not seiz hi arm and held him up he would have fallen
when lucyi call the thing that wa befor us luci becaus it bore her
shapesaw us she drew back with an angri snarl such as a cat give
when taken unawar then her ey rang over us luci ey in form
and colour but luci ey unclean and full of hellfir instead of
the pure gentl orb we knew at that moment the remnant of my love
pass into hate and loath had she then to be kill i could have
done it with savag delight as she look her ey blaze with unholi
light and the face becam wreath with a voluptu smile oh god
how it made me shudder to see it with a careless motion she flung to
the ground callou as a devil the child that up to now she had
clutch strenuous to her breast growl over it as a dog growl
over a bone the child gave a sharp cry and lai there moan there
wa a coldblooded in the act which wrung a groan from arthur when
she advanc to him with outstretch arm and a wanton smile he fell
back and hid hi face in hi hand
she still advanc howev and with a languor voluptu grace
said
come to me arthur leav these other and come to me my arm ar
hungri for you come and we can rest togeth come my husband come
there wa someth diabol sweet in her tonessometh of the
tingl of glass when struckwhich rang through the brain even of us
who heard the word address to anoth as for arthur he seem under
a spell move hi hand from hi face he open wide hi arm she
wa leap for them when van hels sprang forward and held between
them hi littl golden crucifix she recoil from it and with a
suddenli distort face full of rage dash past him as if to enter
the tomb
when within a foot or two of the door howev she stop as if
arrest by some irresist forc then she turn and her face wa
shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp which had now no
quiver from van hels iron nerv never did i see such baffl
malic on a face and never i trust shall such ever be seen again by
mortal ey the beauti colour becam livid the ey seem to throw
out spark of hellfir the brow were wrinkl as though the fold of
the flesh were the coil of medusa snake and the love
bloodstain mouth grew to an open squar as in the passion mask of
the greek and japanes if ever a face meant deathif look could
killw saw it at that moment
and so for full half a minut which seem an etern she remain
between the lift crucifix and the sacr close of her mean of
entri van hels broke the silenc by ask arthur
answer me oh my friend am i to proce in my work
arthur threw himself on hi knee and hid hi face in hi hand as he
answer
do as you will friend do as you will there can be no horror like
thi ever ani more and he groan in spirit quincei and i
simultan move toward him and took hi arm we could hear the
click of the close lantern as van hels held it down come close
to the tomb he began to remov from the chink some of the sacr
emblem which he had place there we all look on in horrifi
amaz as we saw when he stood back the woman with a corpor
bodi as real at that moment as our own pass in through the interstic
where scarc a knifeblad could have gone we all felt a glad sens of
relief when we saw the professor calmli restor the string of putti
to the edg of the door
when thi wa done he lift the child and said
come now my friend we can do no more till tomorrow there is a
funer at noon so here we shall all come befor long after that the
friend of the dead will all be gone by two and when the sexton lock
the gate we shall remain then there is more to do but not like thi of
tonight as for thi littl on he is not much harm and by tomorrow
night he shall be well we shall leav him where the polic will find
him as on the other night and then to home come close to arthur
he said
my friend arthur you have had a sore trial but after when you look
back you will see how it wa necessari you ar now in the bitter
water my child by thi time tomorrow you will pleas god have
pass them and have drunk of the sweet water so do not mourn
overmuch till then i shall not ask you to forgiv me
arthur and quincei came home with me and we tri to cheer each other
on the wai we had left the child in safeti and were tire so we all
slept with more or less realiti of sleep
29 septemb nighta littl befor twelv oclock we threearthur
quincei morri and myselfcal for the professor it wa odd to
notic that by common consent we had all put on black cloth of
cours arthur wore black for he wa in deep mourn but the rest of
us wore it by instinct we got to the churchyard by halfpast on and
stroll about keep out of offici observ so that when the
gravedigg had complet their task and the sexton under the belief
that everi on had gone had lock the gate we had the place all to
ourselv van hels instead of hi littl black bag had with him a
long leather on someth like a cricket bag it wa manifestli of
fair weight
when we were alon and had heard the last of the footstep die out up
the road we silent and as if by order intent follow the
professor to the tomb he unlock the door and we enter close it
behind us then he took from hi bag the lantern which he lit and also
two wax candl which when light he stuck by melt their own
end on other coffin so that thei might give light suffici to work
by when he again lift the lid off luci coffin we all lookedarthur
trembl like an aspenand saw that the bodi lai there in all it
deathbeauti but there wa no love in my own heart noth but
loath for the foul thing which had taken luci shape without her
soul i could see even arthur face grow hard as he look present
he said to van hels
is thi realli luci bodi or onli a demon in her shape
it is her bodi and yet not it but wait a while and you all see her
as she wa and is
she seem like a nightmar of luci as she lai there the point teeth
the bloodstain voluptu mouthwhich it made on shudder to
seeth whole carnal and unspiritu appear seem like a
devilish mockeri of luci sweet puriti van hels with hi usual
methodic began take the variou content from hi bag and
place them readi for us first he took out a solder iron and some
plumb solder and then a small oillamp which gave out when lit in
a corner of the tomb ga which burn at fierc heat with a blue
flame then hi oper knive which he place to hand and last a
round wooden stake some two and a half or three inch thick and about
three feet long on end of it wa harden by char in the fire and
wa sharpen to a fine point with thi stake came a heavi hammer such
as in household is us in the coalcellar for break the lump to
me a doctor prepar for work of ani kind ar stimul and
brace but the effect of these thing on both arthur and quincei wa
to caus them a sort of constern thei both howev kept their
courag and remain silent and quiet
when all wa readi van hels said
befor we do anyth let me tell you thi it is out of the lore and
experi of the ancient and of all those who have studi the power
of the undead when thei becom such there come with the chang the
curs of immort thei cannot die but must go on ag after ag
ad new victim and multipli the evil of the world for all that
die from the prei of the undead becom themselv undead and prei
on their kind and so the circl goe on ever widen like as the
rippl from a stone thrown in the water friend arthur if you had met
that kiss which you know of befor poor luci die or again last night
when you open your arm to her you would in time when you had di
have becom nosferatu as thei call it in eastern europ and would
all time make more of those undead that so have fill us with horror
the career of thi so unhappi dear ladi is but just begun those
children whose blood she suck ar not as yet so much the wors but if
she live on undead more and more thei lose their blood and by her
power over them thei come to her and so she draw their blood with that
so wick mouth but if she die in truth then all ceas the tini
wound of the throat disappear and thei go back to their plai
unknow ever of what ha been but of the most bless of all when
thi now undead be made to rest as true dead then the soul of the poor
ladi whom we love shall again be free instead of work wicked by
night and grow more debas in the assimil of it by dai she
shall take her place with the other angel so that my friend it will
be a bless hand for her that shall strike the blow that set her free
to thi i am will but is there none amongst us who ha a better
right will it be no joi to think of hereaft in the silenc of the
night when sleep is not it wa my hand that sent her to the star it
wa the hand of him that love her best the hand that of all she would
herself have chosen had it been to her to choos tell me if there be
such a on amongst us
we all look at arthur he saw too what we all did the infinit
kind which suggest that hi should be the hand which would restor
luci to us as a holi and not an unholi memori he step forward and
said brave though hi hand trembl and hi face wa as pale as
snow
my true friend from the bottom of my broken heart i thank you tell me
what i am to do and i shall not falter van hels laid a hand on hi
shoulder and said
brave lad a moment courag and it is done thi stake must be
driven through her it will be a fear ordealb not deceiv in
thatbut it will be onli a short time and you will then rejoic more
than your pain wa great from thi grim tomb you will emerg as though
you tread on air but you must not falter when onc you have begun onli
think that we your true friend ar round you and that we prai for
you all the time
go on said arthur hoars tell me what i am to do
take thi stake in your left hand readi to place the point over the
heart and the hammer in your right then when we begin our prayer for
the deadi shall read him i have here the book and the other shall
followstrik in god name that so all mai be well with the dead that
we love and that the undead pass awai
arthur took the stake and the hammer and when onc hi mind wa set on
action hi hand never trembl nor even quiver van hels open
hi missal and began to read and quincei and i follow as well as we
could arthur place the point over the heart and as i look i could
see it dint in the white flesh then he struck with all hi might
the thing in the coffin writh and a hideou bloodcurdl screech
came from the open red lip the bodi shook and quiver and twist
in wild contort the sharp white teeth champ togeth till the
lip were cut and the mouth wa smear with a crimson foam but arthur
never falter he look like a figur of thor as hi untrembl arm
rose and fell drive deeper and deeper the mercybear stake whilst
the blood from the pierc heart well and spurt up around it hi
face wa set and high duti seem to shine through it the sight of it
gave us courag so that our voic seem to ring through the littl
vault
and then the writh and quiver of the bodi becam less and the
teeth seem to champ and the face to quiver final it lai still the
terribl task wa over
the hammer fell from arthur hand he reel and would have fallen had
we not caught him the great drop of sweat sprang from hi forehead
and hi breath came in broken gasp it had inde been an aw strain
on him and had he not been forc to hi task by more than human
consider he could never have gone through with it for a few
minut we were so taken up with him that we did not look toward the
coffin when we did howev a murmur of startl surpris ran from on
to the other of us we gaze so eagerli that arthur rose for he had
been seat on the ground and came and look too and then a glad
strang light broke over hi face and dispel altogeth the gloom of
horror that lai upon it
there in the coffin lai no longer the foul thing that we had so dread
and grown to hate that the work of her destruct wa yield as a
privileg to the on best entitl to it but luci as we had seen her in
her life with her face of unequal sweet and puriti true that
there were there as we had seen them in life the trace of care and
pain and wast but these were all dear to us for thei mark her truth
to what we knew on and all we felt that the holi calm that lai like
sunshin over the wast face and form wa onli an earthli token and
symbol of the calm that wa to reign for ever
van hels came and laid hi hand on arthur shoulder and said to
him
and now arthur my friend dear lad am i not forgiven
the reaction of the terribl strain came as he took the old man hand
in hi and rais it to hi lip press it and said
forgiven god bless you that you have given my dear on her soul again
and me peac he put hi hand on the professor shoulder and lai
hi head on hi breast cri for a while silent whilst we stood
unmov when he rais hi head van hels said to him
and now my child you mai kiss her kiss her dead lip if you will as
she would have you to if for her to choos for she is not a grin
devil nownot ani more a foul thing for all etern no longer she is
the devil undead she is god true dead whose soul is with him
arthur bent and kiss her and then we sent him and quincei out of the
tomb the professor and i saw the top off the stake leav the point
of it in the bodi then we cut off the head and fill the mouth with
garlic we solder up the leaden coffin screw on the coffinlid
and gather up our belong came awai when the professor lock
the door he gave the kei to arthur
outsid the air wa sweet the sun shone and the bird sang and it
seem as if all natur were tune to a differ pitch there wa
glad and mirth and peac everywher for we were at rest ourselv
on on account and we were glad though it wa with a temper joi
befor we move awai van hels said
now my friend on step of our work is done on the most harrow
to ourselv but there remain a greater task to find out the author
of all thi our sorrow and to stamp him out i have clue which we can
follow but it is a long task and a difficult and there is danger in
it and pain shall you not all help me we have learn to believ all
of usi it not so and sinc so do we not see our duti ye and do
we not promis to go on to the bitter end
each in turn we took hi hand and the promis wa made then said the
professor as we move off

made up that the diari of a doctor who attend luci might have
someth to add to the sum of our knowledg of that terribl be and
i said boldli
then dr seward you had better let me copi it out for you on my
typewrit he grew to a posit deathli pallor as he said

30 septembermr harker arriv at nine oclock he had got hi
wife wire just befor start he is uncommonli clever if on can
judg from hi face and full of energi if thi journal be trueand
judg by on own wonder experi it must behe is also a man
of great nerv that go down to the vault a second time wa a
remark piec of dare after read hi account of it i wa
prepar to meet a good specimen of manhood but hardli the quiet
businesslik gentleman who came here todai
lateraft lunch harker and hi wife went back to their own room
and as i pass a while ago i heard the click of the typewrit thei
ar hard at it mr harker sai that thei ar knit togeth in
chronolog order everi scrap of evid thei have harker ha got
the letter between the consigne of the box at whitbi and the
carrier in london who took charg of them he is now read hi wife
typescript of my diari i wonder what thei make out of it here it
is
strang that it never struck me that the veri next hous might be
the count hidingplac good know that we had enough clue
from the conduct of the patient renfield the bundl of letter
relat to the purchas of the hous were with the typescript oh
if we had onli had them earlier we might have save poor luci
stop that wai mad li harker ha gone back and is again
collat hi materi he sai that by dinnertim thei will be
abl to show a whole connect narr he think that in the
meantim i should see renfield as hitherto he ha been a sort of
index to the come and go of the count i hardli see thi yet
but when i get at the date i suppos i shall what a good thing
that mr harker put my cylind into type we never could have
found the date otherwis
i found renfield sit placidli in hi room with hi hand
fold smile benignli at the moment he seem as sane as ani
on i ever saw i sat down and talk with him on a lot of
subject all of which he treat natur he then of hi own
accord spoke of go home a subject he ha never mention to my
knowledg dure hi sojourn here in fact he spoke quit
confid of get hi discharg at onc i believ that had i
not had the chat with harker and read the letter and the date of
hi outburst i should have been prepar to sign for him after a
brief time of observ as it is i am darkli suspici all
those outbreak were in some wai link with the proxim of the
count what then doe thi absolut content mean can it be that
hi instinct is satisfi as to the vampir ultim triumph
stai he is himself zophag and in hi wild rave outsid the
chapel door of the desert hous he alwai spoke of master thi
all seem confirm of our idea howev after a while i came
awai my friend is just a littl too sane at present to make it
safe to probe him too deep with question he might begin to think
and then so i came awai i mistrust these quiet mood of hi so
i have given the attend a hint to look close after him and to
have a straitwaistcoat readi in case of need

knew that i wa busi and that my stai wa short and mr billington had
readi in hi offic all the paper concern the consign of box
it gave me almost a turn to see again on of the letter which i had
seen on the count tabl befor i knew of hi diabol plan
everyth had been carefulli thought out and done systemat and
with precis he seem to have been prepar for everi obstacl which
might be place by accid in the wai of hi intent be carri
out to us an american he had taken no chanc and the absolut
accuraci with which hi instruct were fulfil wa simpli the
logic result of hi care i saw the invoic and took note of it
fifti case of common earth to be us for experiment purpos
also the copi of letter to carter paterson and their repli of both of
these i got copi thi wa all the inform mr billington could
give me so i went down to the port and saw the coastguard the custom

strang entri of the ship which is alreadi take it place in local
tradit but no on could add to the simpl descript fifti case
of common earth i then saw the stationmast who kindli put me in
commun with the men who had actual receiv the box their
talli wa exact with the list and thei had noth to add except that
the box were main and mortal heavi and that shift them wa dry
work on of them ad that it wa hard line that there wasnt ani
gentleman suchlik as yourself squir to show some sort of
appreci of their effort in a liquid form anoth put in a rider
that the thirst then gener wa such that even the time which had
elaps had not complet allai it needless to add i took care
befor leav to lift for ever and adequ thi sourc of
reproach
30 septemberth stationmast wa good enough to give me a line to
hi old companion the stationmast at king cross so that when i
arriv there in the morn i wa abl to ask him about the arriv of
the box he too put me at onc in commun with the proper
offici and i saw that their talli wa correct with the origin
invoic the opportun of acquir an abnorm thirst had been here
limit a nobl us of them had howev been made and again i wa
compel to deal with the result in an ex post facto manner
from thenc i went on to carter paterson central offic where i met
with the utmost courtesi thei look up the transact in their

30 septemberi am so glad that i hardli know how to contain myself
it is i suppos the reaction from the haunt fear which i have had
that thi terribl affair and the reopen of hi old wound might act
detriment on jonathan i saw him leav for whitbi with as brave a
face as i could but i wa sick with apprehens the effort ha
howev done him good he wa never so resolut never so strong never
so full of volcan energi as at present it is just as that dear good
professor van hels said he is true grit and he improv under
strain that would kill a weaker natur he came back full of life and
hope and determin we have got everyth in order for tonight i
feel myself quit wild with excit i suppos on ought to piti ani
thing so hunt as is the count that is just it thi thing is not
humannot even beast to read dr seward account of poor luci
death and what follow is enough to dry up the spring of piti in
on heart
laterlord godalm and mr morri arriv earlier than we
expect dr seward wa out on busi and had taken jonathan with
him so i had to see them it wa to me a pain meet for it
brought back all poor dear luci hope of onli a few month ago of
cours thei had heard luci speak of me and it seem that dr van
hels too ha been quit blow my trumpet as mr morri
express it poor fellow neither of them is awar that i know all
about the propos thei made to luci thei did not quit know what to
sai or do as thei were ignor of the amount of my knowledg so thei
had to keep on neutral subject howev i thought the matter over and
came to the conclus that the best thing i could do would be to post
them in affair right up to date i knew from dr seward diari that
thei had been at luci deathher real deathand that i need not fear
to betrai ani secret befor the time so i told them as well as i
could that i had read all the paper and diari and that my husband
and i have typewritten them had just finish put them in order
i gave them each a copi to read in the librari when lord godalm got
hi and turn it overit doe make a pretti good pileh said
did you write all thi mr harker
i nod and he went on
i dont quit see the drift of it but you peopl ar all so good and
kind and have been work so earnestli and so energet that all
i can do is to accept your idea blindfold and try to help you i have
had on lesson alreadi in accept fact that should make a man humbl
to the last hour of hi life besid i know you love my poor luci
here he turn awai and cover hi face with hi hand i could hear
the tear in hi voic mr morri with instinct delicaci just laid
a hand for a moment on hi shoulder and then walk quietli out of the
room i suppos there is someth in woman natur that make a man
free to break down befor her and express hi feel on the tender or
emot side without feel it derogatori to hi manhood for when
lord godalm found himself alon with me he sat down on the sofa and
gave wai utterli and openli i sat down besid him and took hi hand i
hope he didnt think it forward of me and that if he ever think of it
afterward he never will have such a thought there i wrong him i
know he never willh is too true a gentleman i said to him for i
could see that hi heart wa break
i love dear luci and i know what she wa to you and what you were to
her she and i were like sister and now she is gone will you not let
me be like a sister to you in your troubl i know what sorrow you have
had though i cannot measur the depth of them if sympathi and piti can
help in your afflict wont you let me be of some littl servicefor
luci sake
in an instant the poor dear fellow wa overwhelm with grief it seem
to me that all that he had of late been suffer in silenc found a
vent at onc he grew quit hyster and rais hi open hand beat
hi palm togeth in a perfect agoni of grief he stood up and then sat
down again and the tear rain down hi cheek i felt an infinit
piti for him and open my arm unthinkingli with a sob he laid hi
head on my shoulder and cri like a weari child whilst he shook with
emot
we women have someth of the mother in us that make us rise abov
smaller matter when the motherspirit is invok i felt thi big
sorrow man head rest on me as though it were that of the babi
that some dai mai lie on my bosom and i stroke hi hair as though he
were my own child i never thought at the time how strang it all wa
after a littl bit hi sob ceas and he rais himself with an
apolog though he made no disguis of hi emot he told me that for
dai and night pastweari dai and sleepless nightsh had been
unabl to speak with ani on as a man must speak in hi time of
sorrow there wa no woman whose sympathi could be given to him or with
whom ow to the terribl circumst with which hi sorrow wa
surround he could speak freeli i know now how i suffer he said
as he dri hi ey but i do not know even yetand none other can
ever knowhow much your sweet sympathi ha been to me todai i shall
know better in time and believ me that though i am not ungrat
now my gratitud will grow with my understand you will let me be
like a brother will you not for all our livesfor dear luci sake

dr seward diari
30 septemberi got home at five oclock and found that godalm
and morri had not onli arriv but had alreadi studi the transcript
of the variou diari and letter which harker and hi wonder wife
had made and arrang harker had not yet return from hi visit to the
carrier men of whom dr hennessei had written to me mr harker gave
us a cup of tea and i can honestli sai that for the first time sinc i
have live in it thi old hous seem like home when we had
finish mr harker said
dr seward mai i ask a favour i want to see your patient mr
renfield do let me see him what you have said of him in your diari
interest me so much she look so appeal and so pretti that i
could not refus her and there wa no possibl reason why i should so
i took her with me when i went into the room i told the man that a
ladi would like to see him to which he simpli answer why
she is go through the hous and want to see everi on in it i
answer oh veri well he said let her come in by all mean but
just wait a minut till i tidi up the place hi method of tidi wa
peculiar he simpli swallow all the fli and spider in the box
befor i could stop him it wa quit evid that he fear or wa
jealou of some interfer when he had got through hi disgust
task he said cheerfulli let the ladi come in and sat down on the
edg of hi bed with hi head down but with hi eyelid rais so that
he could see her as she enter for a moment i thought that he might
have some homicid intent i rememb how quiet he had been just
befor he attack me in my own studi and i took care to stand where i
could seiz him at onc if he attempt to make a spring at her she
came into the room with an easi grace which would at onc command
the respect of ani lunaticfor easi is on of the qualiti mad
peopl most respect she walk over to him smile pleasantli and
held out her hand
goodeven mr renfield said she you see i know you for dr
seward ha told me of you he made no immedi repli but ei her all
over intent with a set frown on hi face thi look gave wai to on
of wonder which merg in doubt then to my intens astonish he
said
your not the girl the doctor want to marri ar you you cant be
you know for she dead mr harker smile sweetli as she repli
oh no i have a husband of my own to whom i wa marri befor i ever
saw dr seward or he me i am mr harker
then what ar you do here
my husband and i ar stai on a visit with dr seward
then dont stai
but why not i thought that thi style of convers might not be
pleasant to mr harker ani more than it wa to me so i join in
how did you know i want to marri ani on hi repli wa simpli
contemptu given in a paus in which he turn hi ey from mr
harker to me instantli turn them back again
what an asinin question
i dont see that at all mr renfield said mr harker at onc
champion me he repli to her with as much courtesi and respect as
he had shown contempt to me
you will of cours understand mr harker that when a man is so
love and honour as our host is everyth regard him is of
interest in our littl commun dr seward is love not onli by hi
household and hi friend but even by hi patient who be some of
them hardli in mental equilibrium ar apt to distort caus and
effect sinc i myself have been an inmat of a lunat asylum i
cannot but notic that the sophist tendenc of some of it inmat
lean toward the error of non causa and ignoratio elenchi i
posit open my ey at thi new develop here wa my own pet
lunaticth most pronounc of hi type that i had ever met
withtalk element philosophi and with the manner of a polish
gentleman i wonder if it wa mr harker presenc which had touch
some chord in hi memori if thi new phase wa spontan or in ani
wai due to her unconsci influenc she must have some rare gift or
power
we continu to talk for some time and see that he wa seemingli
quit reason she ventur look at me questioningli as she
began to lead him to hi favourit topic i wa again astonish for
he address himself to the question with the imparti of the
completest saniti he even took himself as an exampl when he mention
certain thing
why i myself am an instanc of a man who had a strang belief inde
it wa no wonder that my friend were alarm and insist on my be
put under control i us to fanci that life wa a posit and
perpetu entiti and that by consum a multitud of live thing no
matter how low in the scale of creation on might indefinit prolong
life at time i held the belief so strongli that i actual tri to
take human life the doctor here will bear me out that on on occas i
tri to kill him for the purpos of strengthen my vital power by
the assimil with my own bodi of hi life through the medium of hi
bloodr of cours upon the scriptur phrase for the blood is
the life though inde the vendor of a certain nostrum ha
vulgaris the truism to the veri point of contempt isnt that true
doctor i nod assent for i wa so amaz that i hardli knew what to
either think or sai it wa hard to imagin that i had seen him eat up
hi spider and fli not five minut befor look at my watch i
saw that i should go to the station to meet van hels so i told mr

mina harker journal
30 septemberwhen we met in dr seward studi two hour after
dinner which had been at six oclock we unconsci form a sort of
board or committe professor van hels took the head of the tabl to
which dr seward motion him as he came into the room he made me sit
next to him on hi right and ask me to act as secretari jonathan sat
next to me opposit us were lord godalm dr seward and mr
morrislord godalm be next the professor and dr seward in the
centr the professor said
i mai i suppos take it that we ar all acquaint with the fact
that ar in these paper we all express assent and he went on
then it were i think good that i tell you someth of the kind of
enemi with which we have to deal i shall then make known to you
someth of the histori of thi man which ha been ascertain for me
so we then can discuss how we shall act and can take our measur
accord
there ar such be as vampir some of us have evid that thei
exist even had we not the proof of our own unhappi experi the
teach and the record of the past give proof enough for sane
peopl i admit that at the first i wa sceptic were it not that
through long year i have train myself to keep an open mind i could not
have believ until such time as that fact thunder on my ear see see
i prove i prove ala had i known at the first what now i knownai
had i even guess at himon so preciou life had been spare to mani of
us who did love her but that is gone and we must so work that other
poor soul perish not whilst we can save the nosferatu do not die
like the bee when he sting onc he is onli stronger and be
stronger have yet more power to work evil thi vampir which is
amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenti men he is of
cun more than mortal for hi cun be the growth of ag he have
still the aid of necrom which is as hi etymolog impli the
divin by the dead and all the dead that he can come nigh to ar
for him at command he is brute and more than brute he is devil in
callou and the heart of him is not he can within limit appear
at will when and where and in ani of the form that ar to him he
can within hi rang direct the element the storm the fog the
thunder he can command all the meaner thing the rat and the owl and
the batth moth and the fox and the wolf he can grow and becom
small and he can at time vanish and come unknown how then ar we to
begin our strike to destroi him how shall we find hi where and have
found it how can we destroi my friend thi is much it is a terribl
task that we undertak and there mai be consequ to make the brave
shudder for if we fail in thi our fight he must sure win and then
where end we life is noth i heed him not but to fail here is not
mere life or death it is that we becom as him that we henceforward
becom foul thing of the night like himwithout heart or conscienc
prei on the bodi and the soul of those we love best to us for
ever ar the gate of heaven shut for who shall open them to us again
we go on for all time abhor by all a blot on the face of god
sunshin an arrow in the side of him who di for man but we ar face
to face with duti and in such case must we shrink for me i sai no
but then i am old and life with hi sunshin hi fair place hi
song of bird hi music and hi love lie far behind you other ar
young some have seen sorrow but there ar fair dai yet in store what
sai you
whilst he wa speak jonathan had taken my hand i fear oh so
much that the appal natur of our danger wa overcom him when i
saw hi hand stretch out but it wa life to me to feel it touchso
strong so selfreli so resolut a brave man hand can speak for
itself it doe not even need a woman love to hear it music
when the professor had done speak my husband look in my ey and i
in hi there wa no need for speak between us
i answer for mina and myself he said
count me in professor said mr quincei morri lacon as usual
i am with you said lord godalm for luci sake if for no other
reason
dr seward simpli nod the professor stood up and after lai hi
golden crucifix on the tabl held out hi hand on either side i took
hi right hand and lord godalm hi left jonathan held my right with
hi left and stretch across to mr morri so as we all took hand our
solemn compact wa made i felt my heart ici cold but it did not even
occur to me to draw back we resum our place and dr van hels
went on with a sort of cheer which show that the seriou work
had begun it wa to be taken as grave and in as businesslik a wai
as ani other transact of life
well you know what we have to contend against but we too ar not
without strength we have on our side power of combinationa power
deni to the vampir kind we have sourc of scienc we ar free to
act and think and the hour of the dai and the night ar our equal
in fact so far as our power extend thei ar unfett and we ar
free to us them we have selfdevot in a caus and an end to
achiev which is not a selfish on these thing ar much
now let us see how far the gener power arrai against us ar
restrict and how the individu cannot in fine let us consid the
limit of the vampir in gener and of thi on in particular
all we have to go upon ar tradit and superstit these do not
at the first appear much when the matter is on of life and deathnai
of more than either life or death yet must we be satisfi in the
first place becaus we have to beno other mean is at our controland
secondli becaus after all these thingstradit and
superstitionar everyth doe not the belief in vampir rest for
othersthough not ala for uson them a year ago which of us would
have receiv such a possibl in the midst of our scientif
sceptic matteroffact nineteenth centuri we even scout a belief
that we saw justifi under our veri ey take it then that the
vampir and the belief in hi limit and hi cure rest for the
moment on the same base for let me tell you he is known everywher
that men have been in old greec in old rome he flourish in germani
all over in franc in india even in the chernoses and in china so
far from us in all wai there even is he and the peopl fear him at
thi dai he have follow the wake of the berserk iceland the
devilbegotten hun the slav the saxon the magyar so far then we
have all we mai act upon and let me tell you that veri much of the
belief ar justifi by what we have seen in our own so unhappi
experi the vampir live on and cannot die by mere pass of the
time he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the
live even more we have seen amongst us that he can even grow
younger that hi vital faculti grow strenuou and seem as though
thei refresh themselv when hi special pabulum is plenti but he
cannot flourish without thi diet he eat not as other even friend
jonathan who live with him for week did never see him to eat never
he throw no shadow he make in the mirror no reflect as again
jonathan observ he ha the strength of mani of hi handwit again
jonathan when he shut the door against the wolf and when he help him
from the dilig too he can transform himself to wolf as we gather
from the ship arriv in whitbi when he tear open the dog he can be as
bat as madam mina saw him on the window at whitbi and as friend john
saw him fly from thi so near hous and as my friend quincei saw him at
the window of miss luci he can come in mist which he createthat nobl
ship captain prove him of thi but from what we know the distanc
he can make thi mist is limit and it can onli be round himself he
come on moonlight rai as element dusta again jonathan saw those
sister in the castl of dracula he becom so smallw ourselv saw
miss luci er she wa at peac slip through a hairbreadth space at the
tomb door he can when onc he find hi wai come out from anyth or
into anyth no matter how close it be bound or even fuse up with
firesold you call it he can see in the darkno small power thi
in a world which is on half shut from the light ah but hear me
through he can do all these thing yet he is not free nai he is even
more prison than the slave of the gallei than the madman in hi cell
he cannot go where he list he who is not of natur ha yet to obei
some of natur lawswhi we know not he mai not enter anywher at the
first unless there be some on of the household who bid him to come
though afterward he can come as he pleas hi power ceas as doe
that of all evil thing at the come of the dai onli at certain time
can he have limit freedom if he be not at the place whither he is
bound he can onli chang himself at noon or at exact sunris or sunset
these thing ar we told and in thi record of our we have proof by
infer thu wherea he can do as he will within hi limit when he
have hi earthhom hi coffinhom hi hellhom the place
unhallow as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicid at
whitbi still at other time he can onli chang when the time come it is
said too that he can onli pass run water at the slack or the flood
of the tide then there ar thing which so afflict him that he ha no
power as the garlic that we know of and as for thing sacr as thi
symbol my crucifix that wa amongst us even now when we resolv to
them he is noth but in their presenc he take hi place far off and
silent with respect there ar other too which i shall tell you of
lest in our seek we mai need them the branch of wild rose on hi
coffin keep him that he move not from it a sacr bullet fire into the
coffin kill him so that he be true dead and as for the stake through
him we know alreadi of it peac or the cutoff head that giveth rest
we have seen it with our ey
thu when we find the habit of thi manthatwa we can confin
him to hi coffin and destroi him if we obei what we know but he is
clever i have ask my friend arminiu of budapesth univers to
make hi record and from all the mean that ar he tell me of what he
ha been he must inde have been that voivod dracula who won hi
name against the turk over the great river on the veri frontier of
turkeyland if it be so then wa he no common man for in that time
and for centuri after he wa spoken of as the cleverest and the most
cun as well as the bravest of the son of the land beyond the
forest that mighti brain and that iron resolut went with him to hi
grave and ar even now arrai against us the dracula were sai
arminiu a great and nobl race though now and again were scion who
were held by their coeval to have had deal with the evil on thei
learn hi secret in the scholom amongst the mountain over lake
hermanstadt where the devil claim the tenth scholar as hi due in the
record ar such word as stregoicawitch ordog and
pokolsatan and hell and in on manuscript thi veri dracula is
spoken of as wampyr which we all understand too well there have been
from the loin of thi veri on great men and good women and their
grave make sacr the earth where alon thi foul can dwell for it
is not the least of it terror that thi evil thing is root deep in
all good in soil barren of holi memori it cannot rest
whilst thei were talk mr morri wa look steadili at the window
and he now got up quietli and went out of the room there wa a littl
paus and then the professor went on
and now we must settl what we do we have here much data and we must
proce to lai out our campaign we know from the inquiri of jonathan
that from the castl to whitbi came fifti box of earth all of which
were deliv at carfax we also know that at least some of these box
have been remov it seem to me that our first step should be to
ascertain whether all the rest remain in the hous beyond that wall
where we look todai or whether ani more have been remov if the
latter we must trace
here we were interrupt in a veri startl wai outsid the hous came
the sound of a pistolshot the glass of the window wa shatter with a
bullet which ricochet from the top of the embrasur struck the
far wall of the room i am afraid i am at heart a coward for i shriek
out the men all jump to their feet lord godalm flew over to the
window and threw up the sash as he did so we heard mr morriss voic
without
sorri i fear i have alarm you i shall come in and tell you about
it a minut later he came in and said
it wa an idiot thing of me to do and i ask your pardon mr
harker most sincer i fear i must have frighten you terribl but
the fact is that whilst the professor wa talk there came a big bat
and sat on the windowsil i have got such a horror of the damn
brute from recent event that i cannot stand them and i went out to
have a shot as i have been do of late of even whenev i have
seen on you us to laugh at me for it then art
did you hit it ask dr van hels
i dont know i fanci not for it flew awai into the wood without
sai ani more he took hi seat and the professor began to resum hi
statement
we must trace each of these box and when we ar readi we must
either captur or kill thi monster in hi lair or we must so to
speak sterilis the earth so that no more he can seek safeti in it
thu in the end we mai find him in hi form of man between the hour of
noon and sunset and so engag with him when he is at hi most weak
and now for you madam mina thi night is the end until all be well
you ar too preciou to us to have such risk when we part tonight you
no more must question we shall tell you all in good time we ar men
and ar abl to bear but you must be our star and our hope and we
shall act all the more free that you ar not in the danger such as we
ar
all the men even jonathan seem reliev but it did not seem to me
good that thei should brave danger and perhap lessen their
safetystrength be the best safetythrough care of me but their
mind were made up and though it wa a bitter pill for me to swallow
i could sai noth save to accept their chivalr care of me
mr morri resum the discuss
as there is no time to lose i vote we have a look at hi hous right
now time is everyth with him and swift action on our part mai save
anoth victim
i own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so
close but i did not sai anyth for i had a greater fear that if i
appear as a drag or a hindranc to their work thei might even leav
me out of their counsel altogeth thei have now gone off to carfax
with mean to get into the hous
manlik thei had told me to go to bed and sleep as if a woman can
sleep when those she love ar in danger i shall lie down and pretend
to sleep lest jonathan have ad anxieti about me when he return
dr seward diari
1 octob 4 a mjust as we were about to leav the hous an
urgent messag wa brought to me from renfield to know if i would see
him at onc as he had someth of the utmost import to sai to me
i told the messeng to sai that i would attend to hi wish in the
morn i wa busi just at the moment the attend ad
he seem veri importun sir i have never seen him so eager i dont
know but what if you dont see him soon he will have on of hi
violent fit i knew the man would not have said thi without some
caus so i said all right ill go now and i ask the other to
wait a few minut for me as i had to go and see my patient
take me with you friend john said the professor hi case in your
diari interest me much and it had bear too now and again on our
case i should much like to see him and especi when hi mind is
disturb
mai i come also ask lord godalm
me too said quincei morri mai i come said harker i nod and
we all went down the passag togeth
we found him in a state of consider excit but far more
ration in hi speech and manner than i had ever seen him there wa an
unusu understand of himself which wa unlik anyth i had ever
met with in a lunat and he took it for grant that hi reason would
prevail with other entir sane we all four went into the room but
none of the other at first said anyth hi request wa that i would
at onc releas him from the asylum and send him home thi he back up
with argument regard hi complet recoveri and adduc hi own
exist saniti i appeal to your friend he said thei will
perhap not mind sit in judgment on my case by the wai you have
not introduc me i wa so much astonish that the odd of
introduc a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment and
besid there wa a certain digniti in the man manner so much of
the habit of equal that i at onc made the introduct lord
godalm professor van hels mr quincei morri of texa mr
renfield he shook hand with each of them sai in turn
lord godalm i had the honour of second your father at the
windham i griev to know by your hold the titl that he is no
more he wa a man love and honour by all who knew him and in hi
youth wa i have heard the inventor of a burnt rum punch much
patronis on derbi night mr morri you should be proud of your great
state it recept into the union wa a preced which mai have
farreach effect hereaft when the pole and the tropic mai hold
allianc to the star and stripe the power of treati mai yet prove a
vast engin of enlarg when the monro doctrin take it true
place as a polit fabl what shall ani man sai of hi pleasur at
meet van hels sir i make no apolog for drop all form of
convent prefix when an individu ha revolutionis therapeut
by hi discoveri of the continu evolut of brainmatt
convent form ar unfit sinc thei would seem to limit him to
on of a class you gentlemen who by nation by hered or by
the possess of natur gift ar fit to hold your respect
place in the move world i take to wit that i am as sane as at
least the major of men who ar in full possess of their liberti
and i am sure that you dr seward humanitarian and medicojurist as
well as scientist will deem it a moral duti to deal with me as on to
be consid as under except circumst he made thi last
appeal with a courtli air of convict which wa not without it own
charm
i think we were all stagger for my own part i wa under the
convict despit my knowledg of the man charact and histori
that hi reason had been restor and i felt under a strong impuls to
tell him that i wa satisfi as to hi saniti and would see about the
necessari formal for hi releas in the morn i thought it
better to wait howev befor make so grave a statement for of old
i knew the sudden chang to which thi particular patient wa liabl
so i content myself with make a gener statement that he appear
to be improv veri rapidli that i would have a longer chat with him
in the morn and would then see what i could do in the direct of
meet hi wish thi did not at all satisfi him for he said
quickli
but i fear dr seward that you hardli apprehend my wish i desir to
go at onceherenowthi veri hourthi veri moment if i mai time
press and in our impli agreement with the old scytheman it is of
the essenc of the contract i am sure it is onli necessari to put
befor so admir a practition as dr seward so simpl yet so
moment a wish to ensur it fulfil he look at me keenli and
see the neg in my face turn to the other and scrutinis
them close not meet ani suffici respons he went on
is it possibl that i have er in my supposit
you have i said frankli but at the same time as i felt brutal
there wa a consider paus and then he said slowli
then i suppos i must onli shift my ground of request let me ask for
thi concessionboon privileg what you will i am content to implor
in such a case not on person ground but for the sake of other i
am not at liberti to give you the whole of my reason but you mai i
assur you take it from me that thei ar good on sound and
unselfish and spring from the highest sens of duti could you look
sir into my heart you would approv to the full the sentiment which
anim me nai more you would count me amongst the best and truest of
your friend again he look at us all keenli i had a grow
convict that thi sudden chang of hi entir intellectu method wa
but yet anoth form or phase of hi mad and so determin to let
him go on a littl longer know from experi that he would like
all lunat give himself awai in the end van hels wa gaze at
him with a look of utmost intens hi bushi eyebrow almost meet
with the fix concentr of hi look he said to renfield in a tone
which did not surpris me at the time but onli when i thought of it
afterwardsfor it wa as of on address an equal
can you not tell frankli your real reason for wish to be free
tonight i will undertak that if you will satisfi even mea stranger
without prejudic and with the habit of keep an open minddr
seward will give you at hi own risk and on hi own respons the
privileg you seek he shook hi head sadli and with a look of
poignant regret on hi face the professor went on
come sir bethink yourself you claim the privileg of reason in the
highest degre sinc you seek to impress us with your complet
reason you do thi whose saniti we have reason to doubt sinc

move toward me so quickli that for the moment i fear that he wa
about to make anoth homicid attack my fear howev were
groundless for he held up hi two hand imploringli and made hi
petit in a move manner as he saw that the veri excess of hi
emot wa milit against him by restor us more to our old
relat he becam still more demonstr i glanc at van hels
and saw my convict reflect in hi ey so i becam a littl more
fix in my manner if not more stern and motion to him that hi
effort were unavail i had previous seen someth of the same
constantli grow excit in him when he had to make some request of
which at the time he had thought much such for instanc as when he
want a cat and i wa prepar to see the collaps into the same
sullen acquiesc on thi occas my expect wa not realis
for when he found that hi appeal would not be success he got into
quit a frantic condit he threw himself on hi knee and held up
hi hand wring them in plaintiv supplic and pour forth a
torrent of entreati with the tear roll down hi cheek and hi
whole face and form express of the deepest emot

chapter xix
jonathan harker journal
1 octob 5 a mi went with the parti to the search with an easi
mind for i think i never saw mina so absolut strong and well i am
so glad that she consent to hold back and let us men do the work
somehow it wa a dread to me that she wa in thi fear busi at
all but now that her work is done and that it is due to her energi and
brain and foresight that the whole stori is put togeth in such a wai
that everi point tell she mai well feel that her part is finish and
that she can henceforth leav the rest to us we were i think all a
littl upset by the scene with mr renfield when we came awai from hi
room we were silent till we got back to the studi then mr morri said
to dr seward
sai jack if that man wasnt attempt a bluff he is about the
sanest lunat i ever saw im not sure but i believ that he had some
seriou purpos and if he had it wa pretti rough on him not to get a
chanc lord godalm and i were silent but dr van hels ad
friend john you know more of lunat than i do and im glad of it
for i fear that if it had been to me to decid i would befor that last
hyster outburst have given him free but we live and learn and in
our present task we must take no chanc as my friend quincei would sai
all is best as thei ar dr seward seem to answer them both in a
dreami kind of wai
i dont know but that i agre with you if that man had been an
ordinari lunat i would have taken my chanc of trust him but he
seem so mix up with the count in an indexi kind of wai that i am
afraid of do anyth wrong by help hi fad i cant forget how
he prai with almost equal fervour for a cat and then tri to tear my
throat out with hi teeth besid he call the count lord and
master and he mai want to get out to help him in some diabol wai
that horrid thing ha the wolv and the rat and hi own kind to help
him so i suppos he isnt abov try to us a respect lunat he
certainli did seem earnest though i onli hope we have done what is
best these thing in conjunct with the wild work we have in hand
help to unnerv a man the professor step over and lai hi hand
on hi shoulder said in hi grave kindli wai
friend john have no fear we ar try to do our duti in a veri sad
and terribl case we can onli do as we deem best what els have we to
hope for except the piti of the good god lord godalm had slip
awai for a few minut but now he return he held up a littl silver
whistl as he remark
that old place mai be full of rat and if so iv got an antidot on
call have pass the wall we took our wai to the hous take care
to keep in the shadow of the tree on the lawn when the moonlight shone
out when we got to the porch the professor open hi bag and took out
a lot of thing which he laid on the step sort them into four
littl group evid on for each then he spoke
my friend we ar go into a terribl danger and we need arm of
mani kind our enemi is not mere spiritu rememb that he ha the
strength of twenti men and that though our neck or our windpip ar
of the common kindand therefor breakabl or crushablehi ar not
amen to mere strength a stronger man or a bodi of men more strong
in all than him can at certain time hold him but thei cannot hurt him
as we can be hurt by him we must therefor guard ourselv from hi
touch keep thi near your hearta he spoke he lift a littl silver
crucifix and held it out to me i be nearest to himput these
flower round your neckher he hand to me a wreath of wither
garlic blossomsfor other enemi more mundan thi revolv and thi
knife and for aid in all these so small electr lamp which you can
fasten to your breast and for all and abov all at the last thi
which we must not desecr needless thi wa a portion of sacr
wafer which he put in an envelop and hand to me each of the other
wa similarli equip now he said friend john where ar the
skeleton kei if so that we can open the door we need not break hous
by the window as befor at miss luci
dr seward tri on or two skeleton kei hi mechan dexter as a
surgeon stand him in good stead present he got on to suit after
a littl plai back and forward the bolt yield and with a rusti
clang shot back we press on the door the rusti hing creak and
it slowli open it wa startlingli like the imag convei to me in
dr seward diari of the open of miss westenra tomb i fanci that
the same idea seem to strike the other for with on accord thei
shrank back the professor wa the first to move forward and step
into the open door
in manu tua domin he said cross himself as he pass over
the threshold we close the door behind us lest when we should have
lit our lamp we should possibl attract attent from the road the
professor carefulli tri the lock lest we might not be abl to open it
from within should we be in a hurri make our exit then we all lit our
lamp and proceed on our search
the light from the tini lamp fell in all sort of odd form as the
rai cross each other or the opac of our bodi threw great
shadow i could not for my life get awai from the feel that there
wa some on els amongst us i suppos it wa the recollect so
powerfulli brought home to me by the grim surround of that terribl
experi in transylvania i think the feel wa common to us all
for i notic that the other kept look over their shoulder at everi
sound and everi new shadow just as i felt myself do
the whole place wa thick with dust the floor wa seemingli inch
deep except where there were recent footstep in which on hold down
my lamp i could see mark of hobnail where the dust wa crack the
wall were fluffi and heavi with dust and in the corner were mass of
spider web whereon the dust had gather till thei look like old
tatter rag as the weight had torn them partli down on a tabl in the
hall wa a great bunch of kei with a timeyellow label on each thei
had been us sever time for on the tabl were sever similar rent
in the blanket of dust similar to that expos when the professor
lift them he turn to me and said
you know thi place jonathan you have copi map of it and you know
it at least more than we do which is the wai to the chapel i had an
idea of it direct though on my former visit i had not been abl to
get admiss to it so i led the wai and after a few wrong turn
found myself opposit a low arch oaken door rib with iron band
thi is the spot said the professor as he turn hi lamp on a small
map of the hous copi from the file of my origin correspond
regard the purchas with a littl troubl we found the kei on the
bunch and open the door we were prepar for some unpleas for
as we were open the door a faint malodor air seem to exhal
through the gap but none of us ever expect such an odour as we
encount none of the other had met the count at all at close
quarter and when i had seen him he wa either in the fast stage of
hi exist in hi room or when he wa gloat with fresh blood in
a ruin build open to the air but here the place wa small and
close and the long disus had made the air stagnant and foul there wa
an earthi smell as of some dry miasma which came through the fouler
air but as to the odour itself how shall i describ it it wa not
alon that it wa compos of all the ill of mortal and with the
pungent acrid smell of blood but it seem as though corrupt had
becom itself corrupt faugh it sicken me to think of it everi breath
exhal by that monster seem to have clung to the place and
intensifi it loathsom
under ordinari circumst such a stench would have brought our
enterpris to an end but thi wa no ordinari case and the high and
terribl purpos in which we were involv gave us a strength which rose
abov mere physic consider after the involuntari shrink
consequ on the first nauseou whiff we on and all set about our
work as though that loathsom place were a garden of rose
we made an accur examin of the place the professor sai as we
began
the first thing is to see how mani of the box ar left we must then
examin everi hole and corner and cranni and see if we cannot get some
clue as to what ha becom of the rest a glanc wa suffici to show
how mani remain for the great earth chest were bulki and there wa
no mistak them
there were onli twentynin left out of the fifti onc i got a fright
for see lord godalm suddenli turn and look out of the vault
door into the dark passag beyond i look too and for an instant my
heart stood still somewher look out from the shadow i seem to
see the high light of the count evil face the ridg of the nose the
red ey the red lip the aw pallor it wa onli for a moment for
as lord godalm said i thought i saw a face but it wa onli the
shadow and resum hi inquiri i turn my lamp in the direct
and step into the passag there wa no sign of ani on and as there
were no corner no door no apertur of ani kind but onli the solid
wall of the passag there could be no hidingplac even for him i
took it that fear had help imagin and said noth
a few minut later i saw morri step suddenli back from a corner which
he wa examin we all follow hi movement with our ey for
undoubtedli some nervous wa grow on us and we saw a whole mass
of phosphoresc which twinkl like star we all instinct drew
back the whole place wa becom aliv with rat
for a moment or two we stood appal all save lord godalm who wa
seemingli prepar for such an emerg rush over to the great
ironbound oaken door which dr seward had describ from the outsid
and which i had seen myself he turn the kei in the lock drew the
huge bolt and swung the door open then take hi littl silver
whistl from hi pocket he blew a low shrill call it wa answer
from behind dr seward hous by the yelp of dog and after about a
minut three terrier came dash round the corner of the hous
unconsci we had all move toward the door and as we move i
notic that the dust had been much disturb the box which had been
taken out had been brought thi wai but even in the minut that had
elaps the number of the rat had vastli increas thei seem to
swarm over the place all at onc till the lamplight shine on their
move dark bodi and glitter bale ey made the place look
like a bank of earth set with firefli the dog dash on but at the
threshold suddenli stop and snarl and then simultan lift
their nose began to howl in most lugubri fashion the rat were
multipli in thousand and we move out
lord godalm lift on of the dog and carri him in place him
on the floor the instant hi feet touch the ground he seem to
recov hi courag and rush at hi natur enemi thei fled befor
him so fast that befor he had shaken the life out of a score the other
dog who had by now been lift in the same manner had but small prei
er the whole mass had vanish
with their go it seem as if some evil presenc had depart for
the dog frisk about and bark merrili as thei made sudden dart at
their prostrat foe and turn them over and over and toss them in
the air with viciou shake we all seem to find our spirit rise
whether it wa the purifi of the deadli atmospher by the open of
the chapel door or the relief which we experienc by find ourselv
in the open i know not but most certainli the shadow of dread seem to
slip from us like a robe and the occas of our come lost someth
of it grim signific though we did not slacken a whit in our
resolut we close the outer door and bar and lock it and
bring the dog with us began our search of the hous we found
noth throughout except dust in extraordinari proport and all
untouch save for my own footstep when i had made my first visit
never onc did the dog exhibit ani symptom of uneasi and even when
we return to the chapel thei frisk about as though thei had been
rabbithunt in a summer wood
the morn wa quicken in the east when we emerg from the front
dr van hels had taken the kei of the halldoor from the bunch and
lock the door in orthodox fashion put the kei into hi pocket
when he had done
so far he said our night ha been emin success no harm ha
come to us such as i fear might be and yet we have ascertain how
mani box ar miss more than all do i rejoic that thi our
firstand perhap our most difficult and dangerousstep ha been
accomplish without the bring thereinto our most sweet madam mina or
troubl her wake or sleep thought with sight and sound and
smell of horror which she might never forget on lesson too we have
learn if it be allow to argu a particulari that the brute
beast which ar to the count command ar yet themselv not amen
to hi spiritu power for look these rat that would come to hi
call just as from hi castl top he summon the wolv to your go and
to that poor mother cry though thei come to him thei run pellmel
from the so littl dog of my friend arthur we have other matter
befor us other danger other fear and that monsterh ha not us
hi power over the brute world for the onli or the last time tonight
so be it that he ha gone elsewher good it ha given us opportun
to cry check in some wai in thi chess game which we plai for the
stake of human soul and now let us go home the dawn is close at hand
and we have reason to be content with our first night work it mai be
ordain that we have mani night and dai to follow if full of peril
but we must go on and from no danger shall we shrink
the hous wa silent when we got back save for some poor creatur who
wa scream awai in on of the distant ward and a low moan sound
from renfield room the poor wretch wa doubtless tortur himself
after the manner of the insan with needless thought of pain
i came tipto into our own room and found mina asleep breath so
softli that i had to put my ear down to hear it she look paler than
usual i hope the meet tonight ha not upset her i am truli
thank that she is to be left out of our futur work and even of our
deliber it is too great a strain for a woman to bear i did not
think so at first but i know better now therefor i am glad that it is
settl there mai be thing which would frighten her to hear and yet
to conceal them from her might be wors than to tell her if onc she
suspect that there wa ani conceal henceforth our work is to be a
seal book to her till at least such time as we can tell her that all
is finish and the earth free from a monster of the nether world i
daresai it will be difficult to begin to keep silenc after such
confid as our but i must be resolut and tomorrow i shall keep
dark over tonight do and shall refus to speak of anyth that
ha happen i rest on the sofa so as not to disturb her
1 octob lateri suppos it wa natur that we should have all
overslept ourselv for the dai wa a busi on and the night had no
rest at all even mina must have felt it exhaust for though i slept
till the sun wa high i wa awak befor her and had to call two or
three time befor she awok inde she wa so sound asleep that for a
few second she did not recogn me but look at me with a sort of
blank terror as on look who ha been wake out of a bad dream she
complain a littl of be tire and i let her rest till later in the
dai we now know of twentyon box have been remov and if it be
that sever were taken in ani of these remov we mai be abl to trace
them all such will of cours immens simplifi our labour and the
sooner the matter is attend to the better i shall look up thoma
snell todai

mina harker journal
1 octoberit is strang to me to be kept in the dark as i am todai
after jonathan full confid for so mani year to see him
manifestli avoid certain matter and those the most vital of all thi
morn i slept late after the fatigu of yesterdai and though
jonathan wa late too he wa the earlier he spoke to me befor he went
out never more sweetli or tenderli but he never mention a word of
what had happen in the visit to the count hous and yet he must
have known how terribl anxiou i wa poor dear fellow i suppos it
must have distress him even more than it did me thei all agre that
it wa best that i should not be drawn further into thi aw work and
i acquiesc but to think that he keep anyth from me and now i am
cry like a silli fool when i know it come from my husband great
love and from the good good wish of those other strong men
that ha done me good well some dai jonathan will tell me all and
lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that i kept
anyth from him i still keep my journal as usual then if he ha
fear of my trust i shall show it to him with everi thought of my
heart put down for hi dear ey to read i feel strang sad and
lowspirit todai i suppos it is the reaction from the terribl
excit
last night i went to bed when the men had gone simpli becaus thei told
me to i didnt feel sleepi and i did feel full of devour anxieti i
kept think over everyth that ha been ever sinc jonathan came to
see me in london and it all seem like a horribl tragedi with fate
press on relentlessli to some destin end everyth that on doe
seem no matter how right it mai be to bring on the veri thing which
is most to be deplor if i hadnt gone to whitbi perhap poor dear
luci would be with us now she hadnt taken to visit the churchyard
till i came and if she hadnt come there in the daytim with me she
wouldnt have walk there in her sleep and if she hadnt gone there at
night and asleep that monster couldnt have destroi her as he did
oh why did i ever go to whitbi there now cry again i wonder what
ha come over me todai i must hide it from jonathan for if he knew
that i had been cry twice in on morningi who never cri on my
own account and whom he ha never caus to shed a tearth dear
fellow would fret hi heart out i shall put a bold face on and if i do
feel weepi he shall never see it i suppos it is on of the lesson
that we poor women have to learn
i cant quit rememb how i fell asleep last night i rememb hear
the sudden bark of the dog and a lot of queer sound like prai
on a veri tumultu scale from mr renfield room which is somewher
under thi and then there wa silenc over everyth silenc so
profound that it startl me and i got up and look out of the window
all wa dark and silent the black shadow thrown by the moonlight
seem full of a silent mysteri of their own not a thing seem to be
stir but all to be grim and fix as death or fate so that a thin
streak of white mist that crept with almost impercept slow
across the grass toward the hous seem to have a sentienc and a
vital of it own i think that the digress of my thought must
have done me good for when i got back to bed i found a lethargi
creep over me i lai a while but could not quit sleep so i got out
and look out of the window again the mist wa spread and wa now
close up to the hous so that i could see it ly thick against the
wall as though it were steal up to the window the poor man wa
more loud than ever and though i could not distinguish a word he said
i could in some wai recognis in hi tone some passion entreati on
hi part then there wa the sound of a struggl and i knew that the
attend were deal with him i wa so frighten that i crept into
bed and pull the cloth over my head put my finger in my ear
i wa not then a bit sleepi at least so i thought but i must have
fallen asleep for except dream i do not rememb anyth until the
morn when jonathan woke me i think that it took me an effort and a
littl time to realis where i wa and that it wa jonathan who wa
bend over me my dream wa veri peculiar and wa almost typic of
the wai that wake thought becom merg in or continu in dream
i thought that i wa asleep and wait for jonathan to come back i
wa veri anxiou about him and i wa powerless to act my feet and my
hand and my brain were weight so that noth could proce at the
usual pace and so i slept uneasili and thought then it began to dawn
upon me that the air wa heavi and dank and cold i put back the
cloth from my face and found to my surpris that all wa dim
around the gaslight which i had left lit for jonathan but turn down
came onli like a tini red spark through the fog which had evid
grown thicker and pour into the room then it occur to me that i
had shut the window befor i had come to bed i would have got out to
make certain on the point but some leaden lethargi seem to chain my
limb and even my will i lai still and endur that wa all i close
my ey but could still see through my eyelid it is wonder what
trick our dream plai us and how conveni we can imagin the
mist grew thicker and thicker and i could see now how it came in for i
could see it like smokeor with the white energi of boil
waterpour in not through the window but through the join of
the door it got thicker and thicker till it seem as if it becam
concentr into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room through the top
of which i could see the light of the ga shine like a red ey thing
began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudi column wa now
whirl in the room and through it all came the scriptur word a
pillar of cloud by dai and of fire by night wa it inde some such
spiritu guidanc that wa come to me in my sleep but the pillar wa
compos of both the dai and the nightguid for the fire wa in the
red ey which at the thought got a new fascin for me till as i
look the fire divid and seem to shine on me through the fog like
two red ey such as luci told me of in her momentari mental wander
when on the cliff the dy sunlight struck the window of st mari
church suddenli the horror burst upon me that it wa thu that jonathan
had seen those aw women grow into realiti through the whirl mist
in the moonlight and in my dream i must have faint for all becam
black dark the last consciou effort which imagin made wa to
show me a livid white face bend over me out of the mist i must be
care of such dream for thei would unseat on reason if there were
too much of them i would get dr van hels or dr seward to prescrib
someth for me which would make me sleep onli that i fear to alarm
them such a dream at the present time would becom woven into their
fear for me tonight i shall strive hard to sleep natur if i do
not i shall tomorrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral that
cannot hurt me for onc and it will give me a good night sleep last
night tire me more than if i had not slept at all
2 octob 10 p mlast night i slept but did not dream i must have
slept soundli for i wa not wake by jonathan come to bed but the
sleep ha not refresh me for todai i feel terribl weak and
spiritless i spent all yesterdai try to read or ly down doze
in the afternoon mr renfield ask if he might see me poor man he wa
veri gentl and when i came awai he kiss my hand and bade god bless
me some wai it affect me much i am cry when i think of him thi
is a new weak of which i must be care jonathan would be
miser if he knew i had been cry he and the other were out till
dinnertim and thei all came in tire i did what i could to brighten
them up and i suppos that the effort did me good for i forgot how
tire i wa after dinner thei sent me to bed and all went off to smoke
togeth as thei said but i knew that thei want to tell each other
of what had occur to each dure the dai i could see from jonathan
manner that he had someth import to commun i wa not so
sleepi as i should have been so befor thei went i ask dr seward to
give me a littl opiat of some kind as i had not slept well the night
befor he veri kindli made me up a sleep draught which he gave to
me tell me that it would do me no harm as it wa veri mild i
have taken it and am wait for sleep which still keep aloof i hope
i have not done wrong for as sleep begin to flirt with me a new fear
come that i mai have been foolish in thu depriv myself of the
power of wake i might want it here come sleep goodnight

have found out anyth i drove to walworth and found with some

eard of im in all my bloomin dai dont believ there aint nobodi

track phonet spell had again misl me a halfcrown tip put the
deputi knowledg at my dispos and i learn that mr bloxam who
had slept off the remain of hi beer on the previou night at

suggest that i wa will to pai hi dai wage to hi foreman for
the privileg of ask him a few question on a privat matter he wa
a smart enough fellow though rough of speech and bear when i had
promis to pai for hi inform and given him an earnest he told me
that he had made two journei between carfax and a hous in piccadilli
and had taken from thi hous to the latter nine great boxesmain
heavi oneswith a hors and cart hire by him for thi purpos i

dr seward diari
1 octoberi am puzzl afresh about renfield hi mood chang so
rapidli that i find it difficult to keep touch of them and as thei
alwai mean someth more than hi own wellb thei form a more
than interest studi thi morn when i went to see him after hi
repuls of van hels hi manner wa that of a man command destini
he wa in fact command destinysubject he did not realli
care for ani of the thing of mere earth he wa in the cloud and
look down on all the weak and want of us poor mortal i
thought i would improv the occas and learn someth so i ask
him
what about the fli these time he smile on me in quit a superior
sort of waysuch a smile as would have becom the face of malvolioa
he answer me
the fly my dear sir ha on strike featur it wing ar typic
of the arial power of the psychic faculti the ancient did well
when thei typifi the soul as a butterfli
i thought i would push hi analog to it utmost logic so i said
quickli
oh it is a soul you ar after now is it hi mad foil hi
reason and a puzzl look spread over hi face as shake hi head
with a decis which i had but seldom seen in him he said
oh no oh no i want no soul life is all i want here he brighten
up i am pretti indiffer about it at present life is all right i
have all i want you must get a new patient doctor if you wish to
studi zophagi
thi puzzl me a littl so i drew him on
then you command life you ar a god i suppos he smile with an
ineff benign superior
oh no far be it from me to arrog to myself the attribut of the
deiti i am not even concern in hi especi spiritu do if i
mai state my intellectu posit i am so far as concern thing
pure terrestri somewhat in the posit which enoch occupi
spiritu thi wa a poser to me i could not at the moment recal
enoch apposit so i had to ask a simpl question though i felt
that by so do i wa lower myself in the ey of the lunat
and why with enoch
becaus he walk with god i could not see the analog but did not
like to admit it so i hark back to what he had deni
so you dont care about life and you dont want soul why not i put
my question quickli and somewhat sternli on purpos to disconcert him
the effort succeed for an instant he unconsci relaps into hi
old servil manner bent low befor me and actual fawn upon me as
he repli
i dont want ani soul inde inde i dont i couldnt us them if
i had them thei would be no manner of us to me i couldnt eat them
or he suddenli stop and the old cun look spread over hi
face like a windsweep on the surfac of the water and doctor as to
life what is it after all when youv got all you requir and you
know that you will never want that is all i have friendsgood
friendslik you dr seward thi wa said with a leer of
inexpress cun i know that i shall never lack the mean of
life
i think that through the cloudi of hi insan he saw some
antagon in me for he at onc fell back on the last refug of such as
hea dog silenc after a short time i saw that for the present it
wa useless to speak to him he wa sulki and so i came awai
later in the dai he sent for me ordinarili i would not have come
without special reason but just at present i am so interest in him
that i would gladli make an effort besid i am glad to have anyth
to help to pass the time harker is out follow up clue and so ar
lord godalm and quincei van hels sit in my studi pore over the
record prepar by the harker he seem to think that by accur
knowledg of all detail he will light upon some clue he doe not wish
to be disturb in the work without caus i would have taken him with
me to see the patient onli i thought that after hi last repuls he
might not care to go again there wa also anoth reason renfield
might not speak so freeli befor a third person as when he and i were
alon
i found him sit out in the middl of the floor on hi stool a pose
which is gener indic of some mental energi on hi part when i
came in he said at onc as though the question had been wait on hi
lip
what about soul it wa evid then that my surmis had been
correct unconsci cerebr wa do it work even with the
lunat i determin to have the matter out what about them
yourself i ask he did not repli for a moment but look all round
him and up and down as though he expect to find some inspir for
an answer
i dont want ani soul he said in a feebl apologet wai the
matter seem prei on hi mind and so i determin to us itto be
cruel onli to be kind so i said
you like life and you want life
oh ye but that is all right you neednt worri about that
but i ask how ar we to get the life without get the soul
also thi seem to puzzl him so i follow it up
a nice time youll have some time when your fly out there with
the soul of thousand of fli and spider and bird and cat buzz
and twitter and miau all round you youv got their live you
know and you must put up with their soul someth seem to affect
hi imagin for he put hi finger to hi ear and shut hi ey
screw them up tightli just as a small boi doe when hi face is be
soap there wa someth pathet in it that touch me it also gave
me a lesson for it seem that befor me wa a childonli a child
though the featur were worn and the stubbl on the jaw wa white it
wa evid that he wa undergo some process of mental disturb
and know how hi past mood had interpret thing seemingli foreign
to himself i thought i would enter into hi mind as well as i could and
go with him the first step wa to restor confid so i ask him
speak pretti loud so that he would hear me through hi close ear
would you like some sugar to get your fli round again he seem to
wake up all at onc and shook hi head with a laugh he repli
not much fli ar poor thing after all after a paus he ad
but i dont want their soul buzz round me all the same
or spider i went on
blow spider what the us of spider there isnt anyth in them
to eat orh stop suddenli as though remind of a forbidden
topic
so so i thought to myself thi is the second time he ha suddenli
stop at the word drink what doe it mean renfield seem himself
awar of have made a laps for he hurri on as though to distract
my attent from it
i dont take ani stock at all in such matter rat and mice and such
small deer as shakespear ha it chickenfe of the larder thei
might be call im past all that sort of nonsens you might as well
ask a man to eat molecul with a pair of chopstick as to try to
interest me about the lesser carnivora when i know of what is befor
me
i see i said you want big thing that you can make your teeth meet
in how would you like to breakfast on eleph
what ridicul nonsens you ar talk he wa get too wide
awak so i thought i would press him hard i wonder i said
reflect what an eleph soul is like
the effect i desir wa obtain for he at onc fell from hi
highhors and becam a child again
i dont want an eleph soul or ani soul at all he said for a
few moment he sat despond suddenli he jump to hi feet with
hi ey blaze and all the sign of intens cerebr excit to
hell with you and your soul he shout why do you plagu me about
soul havent i got enough to worri and pain and distract me alreadi
without think of soul he look so hostil that i thought he wa
in for anoth homicid fit so i blew my whistl the instant
howev that i did so he becam calm and said apologet
forgiv me doctor i forgot myself you do not need ani help i am so
worri in my mind that i am apt to be irrit if you onli knew the
problem i have to face and that i am work out you would piti and
toler and pardon me prai do not put me in a straitwaistcoat i
want to think and i cannot think freeli when my bodi is confin i am
sure you will understand he had evid selfcontrol so when the
attend came i told them not to mind and thei withdrew renfield
watch them go when the door wa close he said with consider
digniti and sweet
dr seward you have been veri consider toward me believ me that
i am veri veri grate to you i thought it well to leav him in thi
mood and so i came awai there is certainli someth to ponder over in
thi man state sever point seem to make what the american
interview call a stori if on could onli get them in proper order
here thei ar
will not mention drink
fear the thought of be burden with the soul of anyth
ha no dread of want life in the futur
despis the meaner form of life altogeth though he dread be
haunt by their soul
logic all these thing point on wai he ha assur of some kind
that he will acquir some higher life he dread the consequenceth
burden of a soul then it is a human life he look to
and the assur
merci god the count ha been to him and there is some new scheme of
terror afoot
lateri went after my round to van hels and told him my
suspicion he grew veri grave and after think the matter over for a
while ask me to take him to renfield i did so as we came to the door
we heard the lunat within sing gaili as he us to do in the time
which now seem so long ago when we enter we saw with amaz that
he had spread out hi sugar as of old the fli letharg with the
autumn were begin to buzz into the room we tri to make him talk
of the subject of our previou convers but he would not attend he
went on with hi sing just as though we had not been present he had
got a scrap of paper and wa fold it into a notebook we had to come
awai as ignor as we went in
hi is a curiou case inde we must watch him tonight

chapter xxi
dr seward diari
3 octoberlet me put down with exact all that happen as well
as i can rememb it sinc last i made an entri not a detail that i
can recal must be forgotten in all calm i must proce
when i came to renfield room i found him ly on the floor on hi
left side in a glitter pool of blood when i went to move him it
becam at onc appar that he had receiv some terribl injuri
there seem none of that uniti of purpos between the part of the bodi
which mark even letharg saniti as the face wa expos i could see
that it wa horribl bruis as though it had been beaten against the
floorinde it wa from the face wound that the pool of blood
origin the attend who wa kneel besid the bodi said to me as
we turn him over
i think sir hi back is broken see both hi right arm and leg and
the whole side of hi face ar paralys how such a thing could have
happen puzzl the attend beyond measur he seem quit
bewild and hi brow were gather in as he said
i cant understand the two thing he could mark hi face like that by
beat hi own head on the floor i saw a young woman do it onc at the
eversfield asylum befor anyon could lai hand on her and i suppos he
might have broke hi neck by fall out of bed if he got in an awkward
kink but for the life of me i cant imagin how the two thing
occur if hi back wa broke he couldnt beat hi head and if hi
face wa like that befor the fall out of bed there would be mark of
it i said to him
go to dr van hels and ask him to kindli come here at onc i want
him without an instant delai the man ran off and within a few
minut the professor in hi dress gown and slipper appear when
he saw renfield on the ground he look keenli at him a moment and
then turn to me i think he recognis my thought in my ey for he
said veri quietli manifestli for the ear of the attend
ah a sad accid he will need veri care watch and much
attent i shall stai with you myself but i shall first dress myself
if you will remain i shall in a few minut join you

the man withdrew and we went into a strict examin of the patient
the wound of the face wa superfici the real injuri wa a depress
fractur of the skull extend right up through the motor area the
professor thought a moment and said
we must reduc the pressur and get back to normal condit as far
as can be the rapid of the suffus show the terribl natur of
hi injuri the whole motor area seem affect the suffus of the
brain will increas quickli so we must trephin at onc or it mai be
too late as he wa speak there wa a soft tap at the door i
went over and open it and found in the corridor without arthur and
quincei in pajama and slipper the former spoke

than we have done mai we come in i nod and held the door open
till thei had enter then i close it again when quincei saw the
attitud and state of the patient and note the horribl pool on the
floor he said softli
my god what ha happen to him poor poor devil i told him
briefli and ad that we expect he would recov conscious after
the operationfor a short time at all event he went at onc and sat
down on the edg of the bed with godalm besid him we all watch
in patienc
we shall wait said van hels just long enough to fix the best
spot for trephin so that we mai most quickli and perfectli remov
the blood clot for it is evid that the hmorrhag is increas
the minut dure which we wait pass with fear slow i had a
horribl sink in my heart and from van hels face i gather
that he felt some fear or apprehens as to what wa to come i dread
the word that renfield might speak i wa posit afraid to think
but the convict of what wa come wa on me as i have read of men
who have heard the deathwatch the poor man breath came in
uncertain gasp each instant he seem as though he would open hi ey
and speak but then would follow a prolong stertor breath and he
would relaps into a more fix insens inur as i wa to sick
bed and death thi suspens grew and grew upon me i could almost
hear the beat of my own heart and the blood surg through my
templ sound like blow from a hammer the silenc final becam
agonis i look at my companion on after anoth and saw from
their flush face and damp brow that thei were endur equal
tortur there wa a nervou suspens over us all as though overhead
some dread bell would peal out powerfulli when we should least expect
it
at last there came a time when it wa evid that the patient wa
sink fast he might die at ani moment i look up at the professor
and caught hi ey fix on mine hi face wa sternli set as he
spoke
there is no time to lose hi word mai be worth mani live i have
been think so as i stood here it mai be there is a soul at stake
we shall oper just abov the ear
without anoth word he made the oper for a few moment the
breath continu to be stertor then there came a breath so
prolong that it seem as though it would tear open hi chest
suddenli hi ey open and becam fix in a wild helpless stare
thi wa continu for a few moment then it soften into a glad
surpris and from the lip came a sigh of relief he move
convuls and as he did so said

have had a terribl dream and it ha left me so weak that i cannot
move what wrong with my face it feel all swollen and it smart
dreadfulli he tri to turn hi head but even with the effort hi
ey seem to grow glassi again so i gentli put it back then van
hels said in a quiet grave tone

injur brain had been work in the interv for when he wa quit
consciou he look at me piercingli with an agonis confus which i
shall never forget and said

then hi ey rove round the room as thei caught sight of the two
figur sit patient on the edg of the bed he went on
if i were not sure alreadi i would know from them for an instant hi
ey closednot with pain or sleep but voluntarili as though he were

seem to becom cool again and i realis where i wa i heard the
dog bark behind our hous but not where he wa as he spoke van
hels ey never blink but hi hand came out and met mine and
grip it hard he did not howev betrai himself he nod slightli
and said go on in a low voic renfield proceed
he came up to the window in the mist as i had seen him often befor
but he wa solid thennot a ghost and hi ey were fierc like a
man when angri he wa laugh with hi red mouth the sharp white
teeth glint in the moonlight when he turn to look back over the belt
of tree to where the dog were bark i wouldnt ask him to come in
at first though i knew he want tojust as he had want all along
then he began promis me thingsnot in word but by do them he
wa interrupt by a word from the professor
how
by make them happen just as he us to send in the fli when the
sun wa shine great big fat on with steel and sapphir on their
wing and big moth in the night with skull and crossbon on their
back van hels nod to him as he whisper to me unconsci
the acherontia aitetropo of the sphingeswhat you call the
deathshead moth the patient went on without stop
then he began to whisper rat rat rat hundr thousand
million of them and everi on a life and dog to eat them and cat
too all live all red blood with year of life in it and not mere
buzz fli i laugh at him for i want to see what he could do
then the dog howl awai beyond the dark tree in hi hous he
beckon me to the window i got up and look out and he rais hi
hand and seem to call out without us ani word a dark mass
spread over the grass come on like the shape of a flame of fire and
then he move the mist to the right and left and i could see that there
were thousand of rat with their ey blaze redlik hi onli
smaller he held up hi hand and thei all stop and i thought he
seem to be sai all these live will i give you ay and mani more
and greater through countless ag if you will fall down and worship
me and then a red cloud like the colour of blood seem to close
over my ey and befor i knew what i wa do i found myself open
the sash and sai to him come in lord and master the rat were
all gone but he slid into the room through the sash though it wa onli
open an inch widejust as the moon herself ha often come in through
the tiniest crack and ha stood befor me in all her size and
splendour
hi voic wa weaker so i moisten hi lip with the brandi again and
he continu but it seem as though hi memori had gone on work in
the interv for hi stori wa further advanc i wa about to call him
back to the point but van hels whisper to me let him go on do
not interrupt him he cannot go back and mayb could not proce at all
if onc he lost the thread of hi thought he proceed
all dai i wait to hear from him but he did not send me anyth not
even a blowfli and when the moon got up i wa pretti angri with him
when he slid in through the window though it wa shut and did not even
knock i got mad with him he sneer at me and hi white face look
out of the mist with hi red ey gleam and he went on as though he
own the whole place and i wa no on he didnt even smell the same
as he went by me i couldnt hold him i thought that somehow mr
harker had come into the room
the two men sit on the bed stood up and came over stand behind
him so that he could not see them but where thei could hear better
thei were both silent but the professor start and quiver hi face
howev grew grimmer and sterner still renfield went on without
notic
when mr harker came in to see me thi afternoon she wasnt the same
it wa like tea after the teapot had been water here we all move
but no on said a word he went on
i didnt know that she wa here till she spoke and she didnt look the
same i dont care for the pale peopl i like them with lot of blood
in them and her had all seem to have run out i didnt think of it
at the time but when she went awai i began to think and it made me mad
to know that he had been take the life out of her i could feel that
the rest quiver as i did but we remain otherwis still so when
he came tonight i wa readi for him i saw the mist steal in and i
grab it tight i had heard that madmen have unnatur strength and
as i knew i wa a madmanat time anyhowi resolv to us my power
ay and he felt it too for he had to come out of the mist to struggl
with me i held tight and i thought i wa go to win for i didnt
mean him to take ani more of her life till i saw hi ey thei burn
into me and my strength becam like water he slip through it and
when i tri to cling to him he rais me up and flung me down there
wa a red cloud befor me and a nois like thunder and the mist seem
to steal awai under the door hi voic wa becom fainter and hi
breath more stertor van hels stood up instinct
we know the worst now he said he is here and we know hi purpos
it mai not be too late let us be armedth same as we were the other

need to put our fear nai our convict into wordsw share them in

headlong into the room the professor did actual fall and i saw
across him as he gather himself up from hand and knee what i saw
appal me i felt my hair rise like bristl on the back of my neck
and my heart seem to stand still
the moonlight wa so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room
wa light enough to see on the bed besid the window lai jonathan
harker hi face flush and breath heavili as though in a stupor
kneel on the near edg of the bed face outward wa the whiteclad
figur of hi wife by her side stood a tall thin man clad in black

into it hi ey flame red with devilish passion the great nostril
of the white aquilin nose open wide and quiver at the edg and the
white sharp teeth behind the full lip of the blooddrip mouth

open had swung back to it old posit van hels art and i move
forward to mr harker who by thi time had drawn her breath and with

ghastli with a pallor which wa accentu by the blood which smear
her lip and cheek and chin from her throat trickl a thin stream of
blood her ey were mad with terror then she put befor her face her
poor crush hand which bore on their white the red mark of the
count terribl grip and from behind them came a low desol wail
which made the terribl scream seem onli the quick express of an
endless grief van hels step forward and drew the coverlet gentli
over her bodi whilst art after look at her face for an instant

fell in a thin white line the part red lip with the sharp white
teeth show between and the red ey that i had seem to see in the
sunset on the window of st mari church at whitbi i knew too the
red scar on hi forehead where jonathan had struck him for an instant
my heart stood still and i would have scream out onli that i wa
paralys in the paus he spoke in a sort of keen cut whisper
point as he spoke to jonathan

befor your veri ey i wa appal and wa too bewild to do or

and hold me tight bare my throat with the other sai as he did
so first a littl refresh to reward my exert you mai as well

must have pass befor he took hi foul aw sneer mouth awai i
saw it drip with the fresh blood the remembr seem for a while to
overpow her and she droop and would have sunk down but for her
husband sustain arm with a great effort she recov herself and
went on
then he spoke to me mockingli and so you like the other would plai

jonathan harker journal
3 octobera i must do someth or go mad i write thi diari it
is now six oclock and we ar to meet in the studi in half an hour and
take someth to eat for dr van hels and dr seward ar agre
that if we do not eat we cannot work our best our best will be god
know requir todai i must keep write at everi chanc for i dare
not stop to think all big and littl must go down perhap at the end
the littl thing mai teach us most the teach big or littl could
not have land mina or me anywher wors than we ar todai howev
we must trust and hope poor mina told me just now with the tear
run down her dear cheek that it is in troubl and trial that our
faith is testedthat we must keep on trust and that god will aid us
up to the end the end oh my god what end to work to work
when dr van hels and dr seward had come back from see poor
renfield we went grave into what wa to be done first dr seward
told us that when he and dr van hels had gone down to the room below
thei had found renfield ly on the floor all in a heap hi face wa
all bruis and crush in and the bone of the neck were broken
dr seward ask the attend who wa on duti in the passag if he had
heard anyth he said that he had been sit downh confess to
half dozingwhen he heard loud voic in the room and then renfield
had call out loudli sever time god god god after that there
wa a sound of fall and when he enter the room he found him ly
on the floor face down just as the doctor had seen him van hels
ask if he had heard voic or a voic and he said he could not
sai that at first it had seem to him as if there were two but as
there wa no on in the room it could have been onli on he could swear
to it if requir that the word god wa spoken by the patient dr
seward said to us when we were alon that he did not wish to go into
the matter the question of an inquest had to be consid and it
would never do to put forward the truth as no on would believ it as
it wa he thought that on the attend evid he could give a
certif of death by misadventur in fall from bed in case the
coron should demand it there would be a formal inquest necessarili
to the same result
when the question began to be discuss as to what should be our next
step the veri first thing we decid wa that mina should be in full
confid that noth of ani sortno matter how painfulshould be
kept from her she herself agre as to it wisdom and it wa piti
to see her so brave and yet so sorrow and in such a depth of
despair there must be no conceal she said ala we have had
too much alreadi and besid there is noth in all the world that can
give me more pain than i have alreadi enduredthan i suffer now
whatev mai happen it must be of new hope or of new courag to me
van hels wa look at her fixedli as she spoke and said suddenli
but quietli
but dear madam mina ar you not afraid not for yourself but for
other from yourself after what ha happen her face grew set in it
line but her ey shone with the devot of a martyr as she
answer
ah no for my mind is made up
to what he ask gentli whilst we were all veri still for each in
our own wai we had a sort of vagu idea of what she meant her answer
came with direct simplic as though she were simpli state a fact
becaus if i find in myselfand i shall watch keenli for ita sign of
harm to ani that i love i shall die
you would not kill yourself he ask hoars
i would if there were no friend who love me who would save me such a
pain and so desper an effort she look at him meaningli as she
spoke he wa sit down but now he rose and came close to her and
put hi hand on her head as he said solemnli
my child there is such an on if it were for your good for myself i
could hold it in my account with god to find such an euthanasia for you
even at thi moment if it were best nai were it safe but my
child for a moment he seem choke and a great sob rose in hi
throat he gulp it down and went on
there ar here some who would stand between you and death you must not
die you must not die by ani hand but least of all by your own until
the other who ha foul your sweet life is true dead you must not
die for if he is still with the quick undead your death would make
you even as he is no you must live you must struggl and strive to
live though death would seem a boon unspeak you must fight death
himself though he come to you in pain or in joi by the dai or the
night in safeti or in peril on your live soul i charg you that you
do not dienai nor think of deathtil thi great evil be past the
poor dear grew white as death and shock and shiver as i have seen a
quicksand shake and shiver at the incom of the tide we were all
silent we could do noth at length she grew more calm and turn to
him said sweetli but oh so sorrowfulli as she held out her hand
i promis you my dear friend that if god will let me live i shall
strive to do so till if it mai be in hi good time thi horror mai
have pass awai from me she wa so good and brave that we all felt
that our heart were strengthen to work and endur for her and we
began to discuss what we were to do i told her that she wa to have all
the paper in the safe and all the paper or diari and phonograph we
might hereaft us and wa to keep the record as she had done befor
she wa pleas with the prospect of anyth to doif pleas could
be us in connect with so grim an interest
as usual van hels had thought ahead of everyon els and wa
prepar with an exact order of our work
it is perhap well he said that at our meet after our visit to
carfax we decid not to do anyth with the earthbox that lai
there had we done so the count must have guess our purpos and
would doubtless have taken measur in advanc to frustrat such an
effort with regard to the other but now he doe not know our
intent nai more in all probabl he doe not know that such a
power exist to us as can sterilis hi lair so that he cannot us
them as of old we ar now so much further advanc in our knowledg as
to their disposit that when we have examin the hous in
piccadilli we mai track the veri last of them todai then is our
and in it rest our hope the sun that rose on our sorrow thi morn
guard us in it cours until it set tonight that monster must
retain whatev form he now ha he is confin within the limit
of hi earthli envelop he cannot melt into thin air nor disappear
through crack or chink or cranni if he go through a doorwai he
must open the door like a mortal and so we have thi dai to hunt out
all hi lair and sterilis them so we shall if we have not yet catch
him and destroi him drive him to bai in some place where the catch
and the destroi shall be in time sure here i start up for i
could not contain myself at the thought that the minut and second so
precious laden with mina life and happi were fly from us
sinc whilst we talk action wa imposs but van hels held up
hi hand warningli nai friend jonathan he said in thi the
quickest wai home is the longest wai so your proverb sai we shall all
act and act with desper quick when the time ha come but think in
all probabl the kei of the situat is in that hous in piccadilli
the count mai have mani hous which he ha bought of them he will have
deed of purchas kei and other thing he will have paper that he
write on he will have hi book of chequ there ar mani belong
that he must have somewher why not in thi place so central so quiet
where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour when in the
veri vast of the traffic there is none to notic we shall go there and
search that hous and when we learn what it hold then we do what our
friend arthur call in hi phrase of hunt stop the earth and so we
run down our old foxso is it not
then let us come at onc i cri we ar wast the preciou
preciou time the professor did not move but simpli said
and how ar we to get into that hous in piccadilli
ani wai i cri we shall break in if need be
and your polic where will thei be and what will thei sai
i wa stagger but i knew that if he wish to delai he had a good
reason for it so i said as quietli as i could
dont wait more than need be you know i am sure what tortur i am
in
ah my child that i do and inde there is no wish of me to add to
your anguish but just think what can we do until all the world be at
movement then will come our time i have thought and thought and it
seem to me that the simplest wai is the best of all now we wish to get
into the hous but we have no kei is it not so i nod
now suppos that you were in truth the owner of that hous and could
not still get in and think there wa to you no conscienc of the
housebreak what would you do
i should get a respect locksmith and set him to work to pick the
lock for me
and your polic thei would interfer would thei not
oh no not if thei knew the man wa properli emploi
then he look at me as keenli as he spoke all that is in doubt is
the conscienc of the employ and the belief of your policemen as to
whether or no that employ ha a good conscienc or a bad on your
polic must inde be zealou men and cleveroh so cleverin read
the heart that thei troubl themselv in such matter no no my
friend jonathan you go take the lock off a hundr empti hous in thi
your london or of ani citi in the world and if you do it as such
thing ar rightli done and at the time such thing ar rightli done
no on will interfer i have read of a gentleman who own a so fine
hous in london and when he went for month of summer to switzerland
and lock up hi hous some burglar came and broke window at back and
got in then he went and made open the shutter in front and walk out
and in through the door befor the veri ey of the polic then he
have an auction in that hous and advertis it and put up big notic
and when the dai come he sell off by a great auction all the good of
that other man who own them then he go to a builder and he sell him
that hous make an agreement that he pull it down and take all awai
within a certain time and your polic and other author help him all
thei can and when that owner come back from hi holidai in switzerland
he find onli an empti hole where hi hous had been thi wa all done
en rgle and in our work we shall be en rgle too we shall not go
so earli that the policemen who have then littl to think of shall deem
it strang but we shall go after ten oclock when there ar mani
about and such thing would be done were we inde owner of the
hous
i could not but see how right he wa and the terribl despair of mina
face becam relax a thought there wa hope in such good counsel van
hels went on
when onc within that hous we mai find more clue at ani rate some of
us can remain there whilst the rest find the other place where there be
more earthboxesat bermondsei and mile end
lord godalm stood up i can be of some us here he said i shall
wire to my peopl to have hors and carriag where thei will be most
conveni
look here old fellow said morri it is a capit idea to have all
readi in case we want to go horseback but dont you think that on
of your snappi carriag with it herald adorn in a bywai of
walworth or mile end would attract too much attent for our purpos
it seem to me that we ought to take cab when we go south or east and
even leav them somewher near the neighbourhood we ar go to
friend quincei is right said the professor hi head is what you
call in plane with the horizon it is a difficult thing that we go to
do and we do not want no peopl to watch us if so it mai
mina took a grow interest in everyth and i wa rejoic to see
that the exig of affair wa help her to forget for a time the
terribl experi of the night she wa veri veri palealmost
ghastli and so thin that her lip were drawn awai show her teeth in
somewhat of promin i did not mention thi last lest it should give
her needless pain but it made my blood run cold in my vein to think of
what had occur with poor luci when the count had suck her blood as
yet there wa no sign of the teeth grow sharper but the time as yet
wa short and there wa time for fear
when we came to the discuss of the sequenc of our effort and of the
disposit of our forc there were new sourc of doubt it wa
final agre that befor start for piccadilli we should destroi the
count lair close at hand in case he should find it out too soon we
should thu be still ahead of him in our work of destruct and hi
presenc in hi pure materi shape and at hi weakest might give us
some new clue
as to the dispos of forc it wa suggest by the professor that
after our visit to carfax we should all enter the hous in piccadilli
that the two doctor and i should remain there whilst lord godalm
and quincei found the lair at walworth and mile end and destroi them
it wa possibl if not like the professor urg that the count
might appear in piccadilli dure the dai and that if so we might be
abl to cope with him then and there at ani rate we might be abl to
follow him in forc to thi plan i strenuous object and so far as
my go wa concern for i said that i intend to stai and protect
mina i thought that my mind wa made up on the subject but mina would
not listen to my object she said that there might be some law matter
in which i could be us that amongst the count paper might be
some clue which i could understand out of my experi in transylvania
and that as it wa all the strength we could muster wa requir to
cope with the count extraordinari power i had to give in for mina
resolut wa fix she said that it wa the last hope for her that
we should all work togeth as for me she said i have no fear
thing have been as bad as thei can be and whatev mai happen must
have in it some element of hope or comfort go my husband god can if
he wish it guard me as well alon as with ani on present so i
start up cry out then in god name let us come at onc for we
ar lose time the count mai come to piccadilli earlier than we
think
not so said van hels hold up hi hand
but why i ask
do you forget he said with actual a smile that last night he
banquet heavili and will sleep late
did i forget shall i evercan i ever can ani of us ever forget that
terribl scene mina struggl hard to keep her brave counten but
the pain overmast her and she put her hand befor her face and
shudder whilst she moan van hels had not intend to recal her
fright experi he had simpli lost sight of her and her part in
the affair in hi intellectu effort when it struck him what he said
he wa horrifi at hi thoughtless and tri to comfort her oh
madam mina he said dear dear madam mina ala that i of all who so
rever you should have said anyth so forget these stupid old
lip of mine and thi stupid old head do not deserv so but you will
forget it will you not he bent low besid her as he spoke she took
hi hand and look at him through her tear said hoars
no i shall not forget for it is well that i rememb and with it i
have so much in memori of you that is sweet that i take it all
togeth now you must all be go soon breakfast is readi and we
must all eat that we mai be strong
breakfast wa a strang meal to us all we tri to be cheer and
encourag each other and mina wa the brightest and most cheer of
us when it wa over van hels stood up and said
now my dear friend we go forth to our terribl enterpris ar we
all arm as we were on that night when first we visit our enemi
lair arm against ghostli as well as carnal attack we all assur
him then it is well now madam mina you ar in ani case quit safe
here until the sunset and befor then we shall returnif we shall
return but befor we go let me see you arm against person attack i
have myself sinc you came down prepar your chamber by the place
of thing of which we know so that he mai not enter now let me guard
yourself on your forehead i touch thi piec of sacr wafer in the
name of the father the son and
there wa a fear scream which almost froze our heart to hear as he
had place the wafer on mina forehead it had sear ithad burn
into the flesh as though it had been a piec of whitehot metal my poor
darl brain had told her the signific of the fact as quickli as
her nerv receiv the pain of it and the two so overwhelm her that
her overwrought natur had it voic in that dread scream but the
word to her thought came quickli the echo of the scream had not ceas
to ring on the air when there came the reaction and she sank on her
knee on the floor in an agoni of abas pull her beauti hair
over her face as the leper of old hi mantl she wail out
unclean unclean even the almighti shun my pollut flesh i must
bear thi mark of shame upon my forehead until the judgment dai thei
all paus i had thrown myself besid her in an agoni of helpless
grief and put my arm around held her tight for a few minut our
sorrow heart beat togeth whilst the friend around us turn awai
their ey that ran tear silent then van hels turn and said
grave so grave that i could not help feel that he wa in some
wai inspir and wa state thing outsid himself
it mai be that you mai have to bear that mark till god himself see fit
as he most sure shall on the judgment dai to redress all wrong of
the earth and of hi children that he ha place thereon and oh madam
mina my dear my dear mai we who love you be there to see when that
red scar the sign of god knowledg of what ha been shall pass awai
and leav your forehead as pure as the heart we know for so sure as
we live that scar shall pass awai when god see right to lift the
burden that is hard upon us till then we bear our cross as hi son did
in obedi to hi will it mai be that we ar chosen instrument of
hi good pleasur and that we ascend to hi bid as that other
through stripe and shame through tear and blood through doubt and
fear and all that make the differ between god and man
there wa hope in hi word and comfort and thei made for resign
mina and i both felt so and simultan we each took on of the old
man hand and bent over and kiss it then without a word we all
knelt down togeth and all hold hand swore to be true to each
other we men pledg ourselv to rais the veil of sorrow from the
head of her whom each in hi own wai we love and we prai for help
and guidanc in the terribl task which lai befor us
it wa then time to start so i said farewel to mina a part which
neither of us shall forget to our dy dai and we set out
to on thing i have made up my mind if we find out that mina must be a
vampir in the end then she shall not go into that unknown and terribl
land alon i suppos it is thu that in old time on vampir meant
mani just as their hideou bodi could onli rest in sacr earth so
the holiest love wa the recruit sergeant for their ghastli rank
we enter carfax without troubl and found all thing the same as on
the first occas it wa hard to believ that amongst so prosaic
surround of neglect and dust and decai there wa ani ground for such
fear as alreadi we knew had not our mind been made up and had there
not been terribl memori to spur us on we could hardli have proceed
with our task we found no paper or ani sign of us in the hous and
in the old chapel the great box look just as we had seen them last
dr van hels said to us solemnli as we stood befor them
and now my friend we have a duti here to do we must sterilis thi
earth so sacr of holi memori that he ha brought from a far
distant land for such fell us he ha chosen thi earth becaus it ha
been holi thu we defeat him with hi own weapon for we make it more
holi still it wa sanctifi to such us of man now we sanctifi it to
god as he spoke he took from hi bag a screwdriv and a wrench and
veri soon the top of on of the case wa thrown open the earth smell
musti and close but we did not somehow seem to mind for our attent
wa concentr on the professor take from hi box a piec of the
sacr wafer he laid it rever on the earth and then shut down
the lid began to screw it home we aid him as he work
on by on we treat in the same wai each of the great box and left
them as we had found them to all appear but in each wa a portion
of the host
when we close the door behind us the professor said solemnli
so much is alreadi done if it mai be that with all the other we can
be so success then the sunset of thi even mai shine on madam
mina forehead all white as ivori and with no stain
as we pass across the lawn on our wai to the station to catch our
train we could see the front of the asylum i look eagerli and in the
window of my own room saw mina i wave my hand to her and nod to
tell that our work there wa successfulli accomplish she nod in
repli to show that she understood the last i saw she wa wave her
hand in farewel it wa with a heavi heart that we sought the station
and just caught the train which wa steam in as we reach the
platform
i have written thi in the train
piccadilli 1230 oclockjust befor we reach fenchurch street
lord godalm said to me
quincei and i will find a locksmith you had better not come with us in
case there should be ani difficulti for under the circumst it
wouldnt seem so bad for us to break into an empti hous but you ar a
solicitor and the incorpor law societi might tell you that you
should have known better i demur as to my not share ani danger
even of odium but he went on besid it will attract less attent
if there ar not too mani of us my titl will make it all right with
the locksmith and with ani policeman that mai come along you had
better go with jack and the professor and stai in the green park
somewher in sight of the hous and when you see the door open and
the smith ha gone awai do you all come across we shall be on the
lookout for you and shall let you in
the advic is good said van hels so we said no more godalm
and morri hurri off in a cab we follow in anoth at the corner
of arlington street our conting got out and stroll into the green
park my heart beat as i saw the hous on which so much of our hope wa
centr loom up grim and silent in it desert condit amongst
it more live and sprucelook neighbour we sat down on a bench
within good view and began to smoke cigar so as to attract as littl
attent as possibl the minut seem to pass with leaden feet as we
wait for the come of the other
at length we saw a fourwheel drive up out of it in leisur
fashion got lord godalm and morri and down from the box descend
a thickset work man with hi rushwoven basket of tool morri paid
the cabman who touch hi hat and drove awai togeth the two
ascend the step and lord godalm point out what he want done
the workman took off hi coat leisur and hung it on on of the spike
of the rail sai someth to a policeman who just then saunter
along the policeman nod acquiesc and the man kneel down
place hi bag besid him after search through it he took out a
select of tool which he produc to lai besid him in orderli
fashion then he stood up look into the keyhol blew into it and
turn to hi employ made some remark lord godalm smile and
the man lift a goodsiz bunch of kei select on of them he
began to probe the lock as if feel hi wai with it after fumbl
about for a bit he tri a second and then a third all at onc the
door open under a slight push from him and he and the two other
enter the hall we sat still my own cigar burnt furious but van
hels went cold altogeth we wait patient as we saw the
workman come out and bring in hi bag then he held the door partli
open steadi it with hi knee whilst he fit a kei to the lock
thi he final hand to lord godalm who took out hi purs and
gave him someth the man touch hi hat took hi bag put on hi
coat and depart not a soul took the slightest notic of the whole
transact
when the man had fairli gone we three cross the street and knock at
the door it wa immedi open by quincei morri besid whom stood
lord godalm light a cigar
the place smell so vile said the latter as we came in it did
inde smell vilelylik the old chapel at carfaxand with our
previou experi it wa plain to us that the count had been us the
place pretti freeli we move to explor the hous all keep togeth
in case of attack for we knew we had a strong and wili enemi to deal
with and as yet we did not know whether the count might not be in the
hous in the diningroom which lai at the back of the hall we found
eight box of earth eight box onli out of the nine which we sought
our work wa not over and would never be until we should have found the
miss box first we open the shutter of the window which look out
across a narrow stoneflag yard at the blank face of a stabl
point to look like the front of a miniatur hous there were no
window in it so we were not afraid of be overlook we did not
lose ani time in examin the chest with the tool which we had
brought with us we open them on by on and treat them as we had
treat those other in the old chapel it wa evid to us that the
count wa not at present in the hous and we proceed to search for
ani of hi effect
after a cursori glanc at the rest of the room from basement to attic
we came to the conclus that the diningroom contain ani effect
which might belong to the count and so we proceed to minut examin
them thei lai in a sort of orderli disord on the great diningroom
tabl there were titl deed of the piccadilli hous in a great bundl
deed of the purchas of the hous at mile end and bermondsei

chapter xxiii
dr seward diari
3 octoberth time seem terribl long whilst we were wait for
the come of godalm and quincei morri the professor tri to keep
our mind activ by us them all the time i could see hi benefic
purpos by the side glanc which he threw from time to time at harker
the poor fellow is overwhelm in a miseri that is appal to see
last night he wa a frank happylook man with strong youth
face full of energi and with dark brown hair todai he is a drawn
haggard old man whose white hair match well with the hollow burn
ey and griefwritten line of hi face hi energi is still intact in
fact he is like a live flame thi mai yet be hi salvat for if
all go well it will tide him over the despair period he will then
in a kind of wai wake again to the realiti of life poor fellow i
thought my own troubl wa bad enough but hi the professor know
thi well enough and is do hi best to keep hi mind activ what he
ha been sai wa under the circumst of absorb interest so
well as i can rememb here it is
i have studi over and over again sinc thei came into my hand all
the paper relat to thi monster and the more i have studi the
greater seem the necess to utterli stamp him out all through there
ar sign of hi advanc not onli of hi power but of hi knowledg of
it as i learn from the research of my friend arminu of budapesth
he wa in life a most wonder man soldier statesman and
alchemistwhich latter wa the highest develop of the
scienceknowledg of hi time he had a mighti brain a learn beyond
compar and a heart that knew no fear and no remors he dare even to
attend the scholom and there wa no branch of knowledg of hi time
that he did not essai well in him the brain power surviv the
physic death though it would seem that memori wa not all complet
in some faculti of mind he ha been and is onli a child but he is
grow and some thing that were childish at the first ar now of
man statur he is experi and do it well and if it had not
been that we have cross hi path he would be yeth mai be yet if we
failth father or further of a new order of be whose road must
lead through death not life
harker groan and said and thi is all arrai against my darl
but how is he experi the knowledg mai help us to defeat him
he ha all along sinc hi come been try hi power slowli but
sure that big childbrain of hi is work well for us it is as
yet a childbrain for had he dare at the first to attempt certain
thing he would long ago have been beyond our power howev he mean
to succe and a man who ha centuri befor him can afford to wait
and to go slow festina lent mai well be hi motto
i fail to understand said harker wearili oh do be more plain to
me perhap grief and troubl ar dull my brain
the professor laid hi hand tenderli on hi shoulder as he spoke
ah my child i will be plain do you not see how of late thi
monster ha been creep into knowledg experiment how he ha been
make us of the zophag patient to effect hi entri into friend
john home for your vampir though in all afterward he can come when
and how he will must at the first make entri onli when ask thereto by
an inmat but these ar not hi most import experi do we not
see how at the first all these so great box were move by other he
knew not then but that must be so but all the time that so great
childbrain of hi wa grow and he began to consid whether he
might not himself move the box so he began to help and then when he
found that thi be allright he try to move them all alon and so he
progress and he scatter these grave of him and none but he know where
thei ar hidden he mai have intend to buri them deep in the ground so
that he onli us them in the night or at such time as he can chang hi
form thei do him equal well and none mai know these ar hi
hidingplac but my child do not despair thi knowledg come to him
just too late alreadi all of hi lair but on be sterilis as for him
and befor the sunset thi shall be so then he have no place where he
can move and hide i delai thi morn that so we might be sure is
there not more at stake for us than for him then why we not be even
more care than him by my clock it is on hour and alreadi if all be
well friend arthur and quincei ar on their wai to us todai is our
dai and we must go sure if slow and lose no chanc see there ar
five of us when those absent on return
whilst he wa speak we were startl by a knock at the hall door the
doubl postman knock of the telegraph boi we all move out to the
hall with on impuls and van hels hold up hi hand to us to
keep silenc step to the door and open it the boi hand in a
despatch the professor close the door again and after look at the
direct open it and read aloud
look out for d he ha just now 1245 come from carfax hurriedli and

i care for noth now he answer hotli except to wipe out thi
brute from the face of creation i would sell my soul to do it

and till sunset he mai not chang it will take him time to arriv
herese it is twenti minut past oneand there ar yet some time
befor he can hither come be he never so quick what we must hope for
is that my lord arthur and quincei arriv first
about half an hour after we had receiv mr harker telegram there
came a quiet resolut knock at the hall door it wa just an ordinari
knock such as is given hourli by thousand of gentlemen but it made
the professor heart and mine beat loudli we look at each other and
togeth move out into the hall we each held readi to us our variou
armamentsth spiritu in the left hand the mortal in the right van
hels pull back the latch and hold the door half open stood
back have both hand readi for action the glad of our heart
must have shown upon our face when on the step close to the door we
saw lord godalm and quincei morri thei came quickli in and close
the door behind them the former sai as thei move along the
hall
it is all right we found both place six box in each and we
destroi them all
destroi ask the professor
for him we were silent for a minut and then quincei said
there noth to do but to wait here if howev he doesnt turn up
by five oclock we must start off for it wont do to leav mr harker
alon after sunset
he will be here befor long now said van hels who had been
consult hi pocketbook nota bene in madam telegram he went
south from carfax that mean he went to cross the river and he could
onli do so at slack of tide which should be someth befor on
oclock that he went south ha a mean for us he is as yet onli
suspici and he went from carfax first to the place where he would
suspect interfer least you must have been at bermondsei onli a
short time befor him that he is not here alreadi show that he went to
mile end next thi took him some time for he would then have to be
carri over the river in some wai believ me my friend we shall not
have long to wait now we should have readi some plan of attack so that
we mai throw awai no chanc hush there is no time now have all your
arm be readi he held up a warn hand as he spoke for we all could
hear a kei softli insert in the lock of the hall door
i could not but admir even at such a moment the wai in which a
domin spirit assert itself in all our hunt parti and
adventur in differ part of the world quincei morri had alwai
been the on to arrang the plan of action and arthur and i had been
accustom to obei him implicitli now the old habit seem to be
renew instinct with a swift glanc around the room he at onc
laid out our plan of attack and without speak a word with a
gestur place us each in posit van hels harker and i were
just behind the door so that when it wa open the professor could
guard it whilst we two step between the incom and the door
godalm behind and quincei in front stood just out of sight readi to
move in front of the window we wait in a suspens that made the
second pass with nightmar slow the slow care step came along
the hall the count wa evid prepar for some surpriseat least
he fear it
suddenli with a singl bound he leap into the room win a wai past
us befor ani of us could rais a hand to stai him there wa someth
so pantherlik in the movementsometh so unhuman that it seem
to sober us all from the shock of hi come the first to act wa
harker who with a quick movement threw himself befor the door
lead into the room in the front of the hous as the count saw us a
horribl sort of snarl pass over hi face show the eyeteeth long
and point but the evil smile as quickli pass into a cold stare of
lionlik disdain hi express again chang as with a singl
impuls we all advanc upon him it wa a piti that we had not some
better organis plan of attack for even at the moment i wonder what
we were to do i did not myself know whether our lethal weapon would
avail us anyth harker evid meant to try the matter for he had
readi hi great kukri knife and made a fierc and sudden cut at him the
blow wa a power on onli the diabol quick of the count
leap back save him a second less and the trenchant blade had shorn
through hi heart as it wa the point just cut the cloth of hi coat
make a wide gap whenc a bundl of banknot and a stream of gold
fell out the express of the count face wa so hellish that for a
moment i fear for harker though i saw him throw the terribl knife
aloft again for anoth stroke instinct i move forward with a
protect impuls hold the crucifix and wafer in my left hand i
felt a mighti power fly along my arm and it wa without surpris that i
saw the monster cower back befor a similar movement made spontan
by each on of us it would be imposs to describ the express of
hate and baffl malignityof anger and hellish ragewhich came over
the count face hi waxen hue becam greenishyellow by the contrast
of hi burn ey and the red scar on the forehead show on the
pallid skin like a palpit wound the next instant with a sinuou
dive he swept under harker arm er hi blow could fall and grasp
a hand of the monei from the floor dash across the room threw
himself at the window amid the crash and glitter of the fall glass
he tumbl into the flag area below through the sound of the
shiver glass i could hear the ting of the gold as some of the
sovereign fell on the flag
we ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground he rush up
the step cross the flag yard and push open the stabl door
there he turn and spoke to us
you think to baffl me youwith your pale face all in a row like
sheep in a butcher you shall be sorri yet each on of you you think
you have left me without a place to rest but i have more my reveng is
just begun i spread it over centuri and time is on my side your
girl that you all love ar mine alreadi and through them you and
other shall yet be minemi creatur to do my bid and to be my
jackal when i want to feed bah with a contemptu sneer he pass
quickli through the door and we heard the rusti bolt creak as he
fasten it behind him a door beyond open and shut the first of us
to speak wa the professor as realis the difficulti of follow
him through the stabl we move toward the hall
we have learnt somethingmuch notwithstand hi brave word he
fear us he fear time he fear want for if not why he hurri so hi
veri tone betrai him or my ear deceiv why take that monei you

return as he spoke he put the monei remain into hi pocket took
the titlede in the bundl as harker had left them and swept the
remain thing into the open fireplac where he set fire to them with
a match
godalm and morri had rush out into the yard and harker had
lower himself from the window to follow the count he had howev
bolt the stabl door and by the time thei had forc it open there
wa no sign of him van hels and i tri to make inquiri at the back
of the hous but the mew wa desert and no on had seen him depart
it wa now late in the afternoon and sunset wa not far off we had to
recognis that our game wa up with heavi heart we agre with the
professor when he said
let us go back to madam minapoor poor dear madam mina all we can do
just now is done and we can there at least protect her but we need
not despair there is but on more earthbox and we must try to find
it when that is done all mai yet be well i could see that he spoke as
brave as he could to comfort harker the poor fellow wa quit broken
down now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppressh
wa think of hi wife
with sad heart we came back to my hous where we found mr harker
wait us with an appear of cheer which did honour to her
braveri and unselfish when she saw our face her own becam as
pale as death for a second or two her ey were close as if she were
in secret prayer and then she said cheerfulli
i can never thank you all enough oh my poor darl as she spoke
she took her husband grei head in her hand and kiss itlai your
poor head here and rest it all will yet be well dear god will protect
us if he so will it in hi good intent the poor fellow groan there
wa no place for word in hi sublim miseri
we had a sort of perfunctori supper togeth and i think it cheer us
all up somewhat it wa perhap the mere anim heat of food to hungri
peoplefor none of us had eaten anyth sinc breakfastor the sens
of companionship mai have help us but anyhow we were all less
miser and saw the morrow as not altogeth without hope true to
our promis we told mr harker everyth which had pass and
although she grew snowi white at time when danger had seem to
threaten her husband and red at other when hi devot to her wa
manifest she listen brave and with calm when we came to the
part where harker had rush at the count so recklessli she clung to
her husband arm and held it tight as though her cling could
protect him from ani harm that might come she said noth howev
till the narrat wa all done and matter had been brought right up
to the present time then without let go her husband hand she
stood up amongst us and spoke oh that i could give ani idea of the
scene of that sweet sweet good good woman in all the radiant beauti
of her youth and anim with the red scar on her forehead of which
she wa consciou and which we saw with grind of our
teethrememb whenc and how it came her love kind against
our grim hate her tender faith against all our fear and doubt and
we know that so far as symbol went she with all her good and
puriti and faith wa outcast from god
jonathan she said and the word sound like music on her lip it wa
so full of love and tender jonathan dear and you all my true
true friend i want you to bear someth in mind through all thi
dread time i know that you must fightthat you must destroi even as
you destroi the fals luci so that the true luci might live hereaft

miseri is the saddest case of all just think what will be hi joi when
he too is destroi in hi worser part that hi better part mai have
spiritu immort you must be piti to him too though it mai
not hold your hand from hi destruct
as she spoke i could see her husband face darken and draw togeth as
though the passion in him were shrivel hi be to it core
instinct the clasp on hi wife hand grew closer till hi
knuckl look white she did not flinch from the pain which i knew she
must have suffer but look at him with ey that were more appeal
than ever as she stop speak he leap to hi feet almost tear
hi hand from her as he spoke

earthli life of him which we ar aim at if beyond it i could send
hi soul for ever and ever to burn hell i would do it

her husband flung himself on hi knee besid her and put hi arm
round her hid hi face in the fold of her dress van hels beckon

certainti that the count is out of the countri ha given her comfort
and comfort is strength to her for my own part now that hi horribl
danger is not face to face with us it seem almost imposs to
believ in it even my own terribl experi in castl dracula seem
like a longforgotten dream here in the crisp autumn air in the bright
sunlight
ala how can i disbeliev in the midst of my thought my ey fell on
the red scar on my poor darl white forehead whilst that last
there can be no disbelief and afterward the veri memori of it will
keep faith crystal clear mina and i fear to be idl so we have been
over all the diari again and again somehow although the realiti
seem greater each time the pain and the fear seem less there is
someth of a guid purpos manifest throughout which is comfort
mina sai that perhap we ar the instrument of ultim good it mai
be i shall try to think as she doe we have never spoken to each other
yet of the futur it is better to wait till we see the professor and
the other after their investig
the dai is run by more quickli than i ever thought a dai could run

mina harker journal
5 octob 5 p mour meet for report present professor van
hels lord godalm dr seward mr quincei morri jonathan
harker mina harker
dr van hels describ what step were taken dure the dai to
discov on what boat and whither bound count dracula made hi escap
as i knew that he want to get back to transylvania i felt sure that
he must go by the danub mouth or by somewher in the black sea sinc
by that wai he come it wa a dreari blank that wa befor us omn
ignotum pro magnifico and so with heavi heart we start to find what
ship leav for the black sea last night he wa in sail ship sinc
madam mina tell of sail be set these not so import as to go in
your list of the ship in the time and so we go by suggest of
lord godalm to your lloyd where ar note of all ship that sail
howev so small there we find that onli on blackseabound ship go
out with the tide she is the czarina catherin and she sail from
doolittl wharf for varna and thenc on to other part and up the
danub soh said i thi is the ship whereon is the count so off
we go to doolittl wharf and there we find a man in an offic of wood
so small that the man look bigger than the offic from him we inquir
of the go of the czarina catherin he swear much and he red face
and loud of voic but he good fellow all the same and when quincei
give him someth from hi pocket which crackl as he roll it up and
put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in hi cloth he
still better fellow and humbl servant to us he come with us and ask
mani men who ar rough and hot these be better fellow too when thei
have been no more thirsti thei sai much of blood and bloom and of
other which i comprehend not though i guess what thei mean but
nevertheless thei tell us all thing which we want to know
thei make known to us among them how last afternoon at about five
oclock come a man so hurri a tall man thin and pale with high nose
and teeth so white and ey that seem to be burn that he be all in
black except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the
time that he scatter hi monei in make quick inquiri as to what ship
sail for the black sea and for where some took him to the offic and
then to the ship where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of
gangplank and ask that the captain come to him the captain come when
told that he will be pai well and though he swear much at the first he
agre to term then the thin man go and some on tell him where hors
and cart can be hire he go there and soon he come again himself
drive cart on which a great box thi he himself lift down though it
take sever to put it on truck for the ship he give much talk to
captain as to how and where hi box is to be place but the captain like
it not and swear at him in mani tongu and tell him that if he like he
can come and see where it shall be but he sai no that he come not
yet for that he have much to do whereupon the captain tell him that he
had better be quickwith bloodfor that hi ship will leav the
placeof bloodbefor the turn of the tidewith blood then the thin
man smile and sai that of cours he must go when he think fit but he
will be surpris if he go quit so soon the captain swear again
polyglot and the thin man make him bow and thank him and sai that he
will so far intrud on hi kind as to come aboard befor the
sail final the captain more red than ever and in more tongu tell
him that he doesnt want no frenchmenwith bloom upon them and also
with bloodin hi shipwith blood on her also and so after ask
where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchas ship
form he depart
no on knew where he went or bloomin well care as thei said for
thei had someth els to think ofwel with blood again for it soon
becam appar to all that the czarina catherin would not sail as
wa expect a thin mist began to creep up from the river and it grew
and grew till soon a dens fog envelop the ship and all around her
the captain swore polyglotveri polyglotpolyglot with bloom and
blood but he could do noth the water rose and rose and he began to
fear that he would lose the tide altogeth he wa in no friendli mood
when just at full tide the thin man came up the gangplank again and
ask to see where hi box had been stow then the captain repli
that he wish that he and hi boxold and with much bloom and
bloodwer in hell but the thin man did not be offend and went down
with the mate and saw where it wa place and came up and stood awhil
on deck in fog he must have come off by himself for none notic him
inde thei thought not of him for soon the fog begin to melt awai and
all wa clear again my friend of the thirst and the languag that wa
of bloom and blood laugh as thei told how the captain swear
exceed even hi usual polyglot and wa more than ever full of
picturesqu when on question other marin who were on movement up
and down on the river that hour he found that few of them had seen ani
of fog at all except where it lai round the wharf howev the ship
went out on the ebb tide and wa doubtless by morn far down the
river mouth she wa by then when thei told us well out to sea
and so my dear madam mina it is that we have to rest for a time for
our enemi is on the sea with the fog at hi command on hi wai to the
danub mouth to sail a ship take time go she never so quick and when
we start we go on land more quick and we meet him there our best hope
is to come on him when in the box between sunris and sunset for then
he can make no struggl and we mai deal with him as we should there
ar dai for us in which we can make readi our plan we know all about
where he go for we have seen the owner of the ship who have shown us
invoic and all paper that can be the box we seek is to be land in
varna and to be given to an agent on ristic who will there present
hi credenti and so our merchant friend will have done hi part
when he ask if there be ani wrong for that so he can telegraph and
have inquiri made at varna we sai no for what is to be done is not
for polic or of the custom it must be done by us alon and in our own
wai
when dr van hels had done speak i ask him if he were certain
that the count had remain on board the ship he repli we have the
best proof of that your own evid when in the hypnot tranc thi
morn i ask him again if it were realli necessari that thei should
pursu the count for oh i dread jonathan leav me and i know that
he would sure go if the other went he answer in grow passion
at first quietli as he went on howev he grew more angri and more
forc till in the end we could not but see wherein wa at least some
of that person domin which made him so long a master amongst
men
ye it is necessarynecessarynecessari for your sake in the first
and then for the sake of human thi monster ha done much harm
alreadi in the narrow scope where he find himself and in the short
time when as yet he wa onli as a bodi grope hi so small measur in

dr seward diari
5 octoberw all rose earli and i think that sleep did much for
each and all of us when we met at earli breakfast there wa more
gener cheer than ani of us had ever expect to experi
again
it is realli wonder how much resili there is in human natur let
ani obstruct caus no matter what be remov in ani wayeven by
deathand we fly back to first principl of hope and enjoy more
than onc as we sat around the tabl my ey open in wonder whether
the whole of the past dai had not been a dream it wa onli when i
caught sight of the red blotch on mr harker forehead that i wa
brought back to realiti even now when i am grave revolv the
matter it is almost imposs to realis that the caus of all our
troubl is still exist even mr harker seem to lose sight of her
troubl for whole spell it is onli now and again when someth
recal it to her mind that she think of her terribl scar we ar to
meet here in my studi in half an hour and decid on our cours of
action i see onli on immedi difficulti i know it by instinct
rather than reason we shall all have to speak frankli and yet i fear
that in some mysteri wai poor mr harker tongu is ti i know
that she form conclus of her own and from all that ha been i can
guess how brilliant and how true thei must be but she will not or
cannot give them utter i have mention thi to van hels and
he and i ar to talk it over when we ar alon i suppos it is some of
that horrid poison which ha got into her vein begin to work the
count had hi own purpos when he gave her what van hels call the
vampir baptism of blood well there mai be a poison that distil
itself out of good thing in an ag when the exist of ptomain is
a mysteri we should not wonder at anyth on thing i know that if my
instinct be true regard poor mr harker silenc then there is a
terribl difficultyan unknown dangerin the work befor us the same
power that compel her silenc mai compel her speech i dare not think
further for so i should in my thought dishonour a nobl woman
van hels is come to my studi a littl befor the other i shall
try to open the subject with him
laterwhen the professor came in we talk over the state of
thing i could see that he had someth on hi mind which he want to
sai but felt some hesit about broach the subject after beat
about the bush a littl he said suddenli
friend john there is someth that you and i must talk of alon just
at the first at ani rate later we mai have to take the other into our
confid then he stop so i wait he went on
madam mina our poor dear madam mina is chang a cold shiver ran
through me to find my worst fear thu endors van hels
continu
with the sad experi of miss luci we must thi time be warn
befor thing go too far our task is now in realiti more difficult than
ever and thi new troubl make everi hour of the direst import i
can see the characterist of the vampir come in her face it is now
but veri veri slight but it is to be seen if we have ey to notic
without to prejudg her teeth ar some sharper and at time her ey
ar more hard but these ar not all there is to her the silenc now
often as so it wa with miss luci she did not speak even when she
wrote that which she wish to be known later now my fear is thi if
it be that she can by our hypnot tranc tell what the count see and
hear is it not more true that he who have hypnotis her first and who
have drink of her veri blood and make her drink of hi should if he
will compel her mind to disclos to him that which she know i nod
acquiesc he went on
then what we must do is to prevent thi we must keep her ignor of
our intent and so she cannot tell what she know not thi is a pain
task oh so pain that it heartbreak me to think of but it must be
when todai we meet i must tell her that for reason which we will not
to speak she must not more be of our council but be simpli guard by
us he wipe hi forehead which had broken out in profus perspir
at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor
soul alreadi so tortur i knew that it would be some sort of comfort
to him if i told him that i also had come to the same conclus for at
ani rate it would take awai the pain of doubt i told him and the
effect wa as i expect
it is now close to the time of our gener gather van hels ha
gone awai to prepar for the meet and hi pain part of it i
realli believ hi purpos is to be abl to prai alon
laterat the veri outset of our meet a great person relief wa
experienc by both van hels and myself mr harker had sent a
messag by her husband to sai that she would not join us at present as
she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movement
without her presenc to embarrass us the professor and i look at each
other for an instant and somehow we both seem reliev for my own
part i thought that if mr harker realis the danger herself it wa
much pain as well as much danger avert under the circumst we
agre by a question look and answer with finger on lip to
preserv silenc in our suspicion until we should have been abl to
confer alon again we went at onc into our plan of campaign van
hels roughli put the fact befor us first
the czarina catherin left the thame yesterdai morn it will take
her at the quickest speed she ha ever made at least three week to
reach varna but we can travel overland to the same place in three dai
now if we allow for two dai less for the ship voyag ow to such
weather influenc as we know that the count can bring to bear and if
we allow a whole dai and night for ani delai which mai occur to us
then we have a margin of nearli two week thu in order to be quit
safe we must leav here on 17th at latest then we shall at ani rate
be in varna a dai befor the ship arriv and abl to make such
prepar as mai be necessari of cours we shall all go armedarm
against evil thing spiritu as well as physic here quincei morri
ad
i understand that the count come from a wolf countri and it mai be
that he shall get there befor us i propos that we add winchest to
our armament i have a kind of belief in a winchest when there is ani
troubl of that sort around do you rememb art when we had the pack
after us at tobolsk what wouldnt we have given then for a repeat
apiec
good said van hels winchest it shall be quincei head is
level at all time but most so when there is to hunt metaphor be more
dishonour to scienc than wolv be of danger to man in the meantim we
can do noth here and as i think that varna is not familiar to ani of
us why not go there more soon it is as long to wait here as there
tonight and tomorrow we can get readi and then if all be well we
four can set out on our journei
we four said harker interrog look from on to anoth of
us
of cours answer the professor quickli you must remain to take
care of your so sweet wife harker wa silent for awhil and then said
in a hollow voic
let us talk of that part of it in the morn i want to consult with
mina i thought that now wa the time for van hels to warn him not
to disclos our plan to her but he took no notic i look at him
significantli and cough for answer he put hi finger on hi lip and
turn awai

do not think it wa such a shock to ani of us as might have been
expect true we did not know whenc or how or when the bolt would

the delai of arriv at varna made us individu satisfi that thing
would not be just as we had expect we onli wait to learn where the
chang would occur none the less howev wa it a surpris i suppos
that natur work on such a hope basi that we believ against
ourselv that thing will be as thei ought to be not as we should know
that thei will be transcendent is a beacon to the angel even if
it be a willothewisp to man it wa an odd experi and we all
took it differ van hels rais hi hand over hi head for a
moment as though in remonstr with the almighti but he said not a
word and in a few second stood up with hi face sternli set lord
godalm grew veri pale and sat breath heavili i wa myself half
stun and look in wonder at on after anoth quincei morri
tighten hi belt with that quick movement which i knew so well in our
old wander dai it meant action mr harker grew ghastli white so
that the scar on her forehead seem to burn but she fold her hand
meekli and look up in prayer harker smiledactu smiledth

with madam mina and me and we shall consult for so if time be long you
mai be delai and it will not matter when the sun set sinc i am here
with madam to make report
and i said mr harker brightli and more like her old self than she
had been for mani a long dai shall try to be of us in all wai and
shall think and write for you as i us to do someth is shift
from me in some strang wai and i feel freer than i have been of late
the three younger men look happier at the moment as thei seem to
realis the signific of her word but van hels and i turn to
each other met each a grave and troubl glanc we said noth at the
time howev
when the three men had gone out to their task van hels ask mr
harker to look up the copi of the diari and find him the part of
harker journal at the castl she went awai to get it when the door
wa shut upon her he said to me
we mean the same speak out
there is some chang it is a hope that make me sick for it mai
deceiv us
quit so do you know why i ask her to get the manuscript
no said i unless it wa to get an opportun of see me alon
you ar in part right friend john but onli in part i want to tell
you someth and oh my friend i am take a greata terriblerisk
but i believ it is right in the moment when madam mina said those
word that arrest both our understand an inspir came to me in
the tranc of three dai ago the count sent her hi spirit to read her
mind or more like he took her to see him in hi earthbox in the ship
with water rush just as it go free at rise and set of sun he learn
then that we ar here for she have more to tell in her open life with
ey to see and ear to hear than he shut as he is in hi coffinbox
now he make hi most effort to escap us at present he want her not
he is sure with hi so great knowledg that she will come at hi call
but he cut her offtak her as he can do out of hi own power that
so she come not to him ah there i have hope that our manbrain that
have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of god will
come higher than hi childbrain that lie in hi tomb for centuri
that grow not yet to our statur and that do onli work selfish and
therefor small here come madam mina not a word to her of her tranc
she know it not and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when
we want all her hope all her courag when most we want all her great
brain which is train like man brain but is of sweet woman and have
a special power which the count give her and which he mai not take awai
altogetherthough he think not so hush let me speak and you shall
learn oh john my friend we ar in aw strait i fear as i never
fear befor we can onli trust the good god silenc here she come
i thought that the professor wa go to break down and have hyster
just as he had when luci di but with a great effort he control
himself and wa at perfect nervou pois when mr harker trip into
the room bright and happylook and in the do of work seemingli
forget of her miseri as she came in she hand a number of sheet
of typewrit to van hels he look over them grave hi face
brighten up as he read then hold the page between hi finger and
thumb he said
friend john to you with so much of experi alreadyand you too
dear madam mina that ar youngher is a lesson do not fear ever to
think a halfthought ha been buzz often in my brain but i fear to
let him loos hi wing here now with more knowledg i go back to
where that halfthought come from and i find that he be no halfthought
at all that be a whole thought though so young that he is not yet
strong to us hi littl wing nai like the ugli duck of my friend
han andersen he be no duckthought at all but a big swanthought that
sail nobli on big wing when the time come for him to try them see i
read here what jonathan have written
that other of hi race who in a later ag again and again brought
hi forc over the great river into turkei land who when he wa
beaten back came again and again and again though he had to come
alon from the bloodi field where hi troop were be slaughter
sinc he knew that he alon could ultim triumph
what doe thi tell us not much no the count childthought see
noth therefor he speak so free your manthought see noth my
manthought see noth till just now no but there come anoth word
from some on who speak without thought becaus she too know not what
it meanwhat it might mean just as there ar element which rest
yet when in natur cours thei move on their wai and thei touchthen
pouf and there come a flash of light heaven wide that blind and kill
and destroi some but that show up all earth below for leagu and
leagu is it not so well i shall explain to begin have you ever
studi the philosophi of crime ye and no you john ye for it is
a studi of insan you no madam mina for crime touch you notnot
but onc still your mind work true and argu not a particulari ad
universal there is thi peculiar in crimin it is so constant
in all countri and at all time that even polic who know not much
from philosophi come to know it empir that it is that is to
be empir the crimin alwai work at on crimethat is the true
crimin who seem predestin to crime and who will of none other
thi crimin ha not full manbrain he is clever and cun and
resourc but he be not of manstatur as to brain he be of
childbrain in much now thi crimin of our is predestin to crime
also he too have childbrain and it is of the child to do what he
have done the littl bird the littl fish the littl anim learn not
by principl but empir and when he learn to do then there is to
him the ground to start from to do more do pou sto said
archimed give me a fulcrum and i shall move the world to do onc
is the fulcrum wherebi childbrain becom manbrain and until he have
the purpos to do more he continu to do the same again everi time
just as he have done befor oh my dear i see that your ey ar
open and that to you the lightn flash show all the leagu for
mr harker began to clap her hand and her ey sparkl he went on
now you shall speak tell us two dry men of scienc what you see with
those so bright ey he took her hand and held it whilst she spoke
hi finger and thumb close on her puls as i thought instinct and
unconsci as she spoke
the count is a crimin and of crimin type nordau and lombroso would
so classifi him and qu crimin he is of imperfectli form mind
thu in a difficulti he ha to seek resourc in habit hi past is a
clue and the on page of it that we knowand that from hi own
lipstel that onc befor when in what mr morri would call a
tight place he went back to hi own countri from the land he had
tri to invad and thenc without lose purpos prepar himself
for a new effort he came again better equip for hi work and won
so he came to london to invad a new land he wa beaten and when all
hope of success wa lost and hi exist in danger he fled back over
the sea to hi home just as formerli he had fled back over the danub
from turkei land
good good oh you so clever ladi said van hels
enthusiast as he stoop and kiss her hand a moment later he
said to me as calmli as though we had been have a sickroom
consult
seventytwo onli and in all thi excit i have hope turn to
her again he said with keen expect
but go on go on there is more to tell if you will be not afraid
john and i know i do in ani case and shall tell you if you ar right
speak without fear
i will try to but you will forgiv me if i seem egotist
nai fear not you must be egotist for it is of you that we think
then as he is crimin he is selfish and as hi intellect is small
and hi action is base on selfish he confin himself to on
purpos that purpos is remorseless as he fled back over the danub
leav hi forc to be cut to piec so now he is intent on be
safe careless of all so hi own selfish free my soul somewhat
from the terribl power which he acquir over me on that dread
night i felt it oh i felt it thank god for hi great merci my soul
is freer than it ha been sinc that aw hour and all that haunt me
is a fear lest in some tranc or dream he mai have us my knowledg for
hi end the professor stood up
he ha so us your mind and by it he ha left us here in varna
whilst the ship that carri him rush through envelop fog up to
galatz where doubtless he had made prepar for escap from us
but hi childmind onli saw so far and it mai be that as ever is in
god provid the veri thing that the evildo most reckon on for
hi selfish good turn out to be hi chiefest harm the hunter is taken
in hi own snare as the great psalmist sai for now that he think he
is free from everi trace of us all and that he ha escap us with so
mani hour to him then hi selfish childbrain will whisper him to
sleep he think too that as he cut himself off from know your mind
there can be no knowledg of him to you there is where he fail that
terribl baptism of blood which he give you make you free to go to him
in spirit as you have as yet done in your time of freedom when the
sun rise and set at such time you go by my volit and not by hi
and thi power to good of you and other as you have won from your
suffer at hi hand thi is now all the more preciou that he know
it not and to guard himself have even cut himself off from hi
knowledg of our where we howev ar not selfish and we believ
that god is with us through all thi black and these mani dark
hour we shall follow him and we shall not flinch even if we peril
ourselv that we becom like him friend john thi ha been a great
hour and it have done much to advanc us on our wai you must be scribe
and write him all down so that when the other return from their work
you can give it to them then thei shall know as we do
and so i have written it whilst we wait their return and mr harker
ha written with her typewrit all sinc she brought the ms to us
chapter xxvi
dr seward diari
29 octoberthi is written in the train from varna to galatz last
night we all assembl a littl befor the time of sunset each of us
had done hi work as well as he could so far as thought and endeavour
and opportun go we ar prepar for the whole of our journei and
for our work when we get to galatz when the usual time came round mr
harker prepar herself for her hypnot effort and after a longer and
more seriou effort on the part of van hels than ha been usual
necessari she sank into the tranc usual she speak on a hint but
thi time the professor had to ask her question and to ask them pretti
resolut befor we could learn anyth at last her answer came
i can see noth we ar still there ar no wave lap but onli a
steadi swirl of water softli run against the hawser i can hear
men voic call near and far and the roll and creak of oar in
the rowlock a gun is fire somewher the echo of it seem far awai
there is tramp of feet overhead and rope and chain ar drag
along what is thi there is a gleam of light i can feel the air
blow upon me
here she stop she had risen as if impuls from where she lai
on the sofa and rais both her hand palm upward as if lift a
weight van hels and i look at each other with understand
quincei rais hi eyebrow slightli and look at her intent whilst
harker hand instinct close round the hilt of hi kukri there
wa a long paus we all knew that the time when she could speak wa
pass but we felt that it wa useless to sai anyth suddenli she
sat up and as she open her ey said sweetli
would none of you like a cup of tea you must all be so tire we
could onli make her happi and so acquiesc she bustl off to get
tea when she had gone van hels said
you see my friend he is close to land he ha left hi
earthchest but he ha yet to get on shore in the night he mai lie
hidden somewher but if he be not carri on shore or if the ship do
not touch it he cannot achiev the land in such case he can if it be
in the night chang hi form and can jump or fly on shore as he did
at whitbi but if the dai come befor he get on shore then unless he
be carri he cannot escap and if he be carri then the custom men
mai discov what the box contain thu in fine if he escap not on
shore tonight or befor dawn there will be the whole dai lost to him
we mai then arriv in time for if he escap not at night we shall come
on him in daytim box up and at our merci for he dare not be hi
true self awak and visibl lest he be discov
there wa no more to be said so we wait in patienc until the dawn
at which time we might learn more from mr harker
earli thi morn we listen with breathless anxieti for her
respons in her tranc the hypnot stage wa even longer in come
than befor and when it came the time remain until full sunris wa
so short that we began to despair van hels seem to throw hi whole
soul into the effort at last in obedi to hi will she made
repli
all is dark i hear lap water level with me and some creak as
of wood on wood she paus and the red sun shot up we must wait till
tonight
and so it is that we ar travel toward galatz in an agoni of
expect we ar due to arriv between two and three in the morn
but alreadi at bucharest we ar three hour late so we cannot
possibl get in till well after sunup thu we shall have two more
hypnot messag from mr harker either or both mai possibl throw
more light on what is happen
latersunset ha come and gone fortun it came at a time when
there wa no distract for had it occur whilst we were at a
station we might not have secur the necessari calm and isol
mr harker yield to the hypnot influenc even less readili than
thi morn i am in fear that her power of read the count
sensat mai die awai just when we want it most it seem to me that
her imagin is begin to work whilst she ha been in the tranc
hitherto she ha confin herself to the simplest of fact if thi goe
on it mai ultim mislead us if i thought that the count power
over her would die awai equal with her power of knowledg it would be
a happi thought but i am afraid that it mai not be so when she did
speak her word were enigmat
someth is go out i can feel it pass me like a cold wind i can
hear far off confus soundsa of men talk in strang tongu
fiercefal water and the howl of wolv she stop and a
shudder ran through her increas in intens for a few second
till at the end she shook as though in a palsi she said no more even
in answer to the professor imper question when she woke from
the tranc she wa cold and exhaust and languid but her mind wa
all alert she could not rememb anyth but ask what she had said
when she wa told she ponder over it deepli for a long time and in
silenc
30 octob 7 a mwe ar near galatz now and i mai not have time
to write later sunris thi morn wa anxious look for by us all
know of the increas difficulti of procur the hypnot tranc
van hels began hi pass earlier than usual thei produc no
effect howev until the regular time when she yield with a still
greater difficulti onli a minut befor the sun rose the professor
lost no time in hi question her answer came with equal quick
all is dark i hear water swirl by level with my ear and the
creak of wood on wood cattl low far off there is anoth sound a
queer on like she stop and grew white and whiter still
go on go on speak i command you said van hels in an agonis
voic at the same time there wa despair in hi ey for the risen sun
wa redden even mr harker pale face she open her ey and we
all start as she said sweetli and seemingli with the utmost
unconcern
oh professor why ask me to do what you know i cant i dont rememb
anyth then see the look of amaz on our face she said
turn from on to the other with a troubl look
what have i said what have i done i know noth onli that i wa

child
oh madam mina he said sadli it is proof if proof be need of
how i love and honour you when a word for your good spoken more
earnest than ever can seem so strang becaus it is to order her whom i

their power thei were more than kind and courteou and took us at onc
on board the czarina catherin which lai at anchor out in the river
harbour there we saw the captain donelson by name who told us of hi
voyag he said that in all hi life he had never had so favour a
run
man he said but it made us afeard for we expeckit that we should
have to pai for it wi some rare piec o ill luck so as to keep up the
averag it no canni to run frae london to the black sea wi a wind
ahint ye as though the deil himself were blawin on yer sail for hi
ain purpos an a the time we could no speer a thing gin we were nigh
a ship or a port or a headland a fog fell on us and travel wi us
till when after it had lift and we look out the deil a thing could
we see we ran by gibraltar wioot bein abl to signal an till we
came to the dardanel and had to wait to get our permit to pass we
never were within hail o aught at first i inclin to slack off sail
and beat about till the fog wa lift but while i thocht that if the
deil wa mind to get us into the black sea quick he wa like to do it
whether we would or no if we had a quick voyag it would be no to our
miscredit wi the owner or no hurt to our traffic an the old mon who
had serv hi ain purpos wad be decent grate to us for no
hinderin him thi mixtur of simplic and cun of superstit
and commerci reason arous van hels who said
mine friend that devil is more clever than he is thought by some and
he know when he meet hi match the skipper wa not displeas with the
compliment and went on
when we got past the bosphoru the men began to grumbl some o them
the roumanian came and ask me to heav overboard a big box which had
been put on board by a queer lookin old man just befor we had start
frae london i had seen them speer at the fellow and put out their twa
finger when thei saw him to guard against the evil ey man but the
supersteet of foreign is pairfectli rideecul i sent them aboot
their busi pretti quick but as just after a fog close in on us i
felt a wee bit as thei did anent someth though i wouldnt sai it wa
agin the big box well on we went and as the fog didnt let up for
five dai i joost let the wind carri us for if the deil want to get
somewhereswel he would fetch it up areet an if he didnt well
wed keep a sharp lookout anyhow sure eneuch we had a fair wai and
deep water all the time and two dai ago when the mornin sun came
through the fog we found ourselv just in the river opposit galatz
the roumanian were wild and want me right or wrong to take out the
box and fling it in the river i had to argi wi them aboot it wi a
handspik an when the last o them rose off the deck wi hi head in
hi hand i had convinc them that evil ey or no evil ey the
properti and the trust of my owner were better in my hand than in the
river danub thei had mind ye taken the box on the deck readi to
fling in and as it wa mark galatz via varna i thocht id let it
lie till we discharg in the port an get rid ot althegith we
didnt do much clearin that dai an had to remain the nicht at anchor
but in the mornin braw an airli an hour befor sunup a man came
aboard wi an order written to him from england to receiv a box
mark for on count dracula sure eneuch the matter wa on readi to
hi hand he had hi paper a reet an glad i wa to be rid o the
dam thing for i wa beginnin masel to feel uneasi at it if the deil
did have ani luggag aboord the ship im thinkin it wa nane ither
than that same

restrain eager
ill be tellin ye quick he answer and step down to hi
cabin produc a receipt sign immanuel hildesheim burgenstrass

with thank we came awai
we found hildesheim in hi offic a hebrew of rather the adelphi
theatr type with a nose like a sheep and a fez hi argument were
point with speciew do the punctuationand with a littl
bargain he told us what he knew thi turn out to be simpl but
import he had receiv a letter from mr de vill of london tell
him to receiv if possibl befor sunris so as to avoid custom a box
which would arriv at galatz in the czarina catherin thi he wa to
give in charg to a certain petrof skinski who dealt with the slovak
who trade down the river to the port he had been paid for hi work by
an english bank note which had been duli cash for gold at the danub
intern bank when skinski had come to him he had taken him to
the ship and hand over the box so as to save porterag that wa all
he knew
we then sought for skinski but were unabl to find him on of hi
neighbour who did not seem to bear him ani affect said that he had
gone awai two dai befor no on knew whither thi wa corrobor by
hi landlord who had receiv by messeng the kei of the hous
togeth with the rent due in english monei thi had been between ten
and eleven oclock last night we were at a standstil again
whilst we were talk on came run and breathlessli gasp out that
the bodi of skinski had been found insid the wall of the churchyard of
st peter and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild
anim those we had been speak with ran off to see the horror the
women cry out thi is the work of a slovak we hurri awai lest we
should have been in some wai drawn into the affair and so detain
as we came home we could arriv at no definit conclus we were all

mina harker memorandum
enter in her journal
ground of inquirycount dracula problem is to get back to hi own
place
a he must be brought back by some on thi is evid for had he
power to move himself as he wish he could go either as man or wolf
or bat or in some other wai he evid fear discoveri or
interfer in the state of helpless in which he must beconfin
as he is between dawn and sunset in hi wooden box
b how is he to be takenher a process of exclus mai help
us by road by rail by water
1 by roadther ar endless difficulti especi in leav the
citi
x there ar peopl and peopl ar curiou and investig a hint
a surmis a doubt as to what might be in the box would destroi him
y there ar or there mai be custom and octroi offic to pass
z hi pursuer might follow thi is hi highest fear and in order
to prevent hi be betrai he ha repel so far as he can even
hi victimm
2 by railther is no on in charg of the box it would have to
take it chanc of be delai and delai would be fatal with enemi
on the track true he might escap at night but what would he be if
left in a strang place with no refug that he could fly to thi is not
what he intend and he doe not mean to risk it
3 by waterher is the safest wai in on respect but with most
danger in anoth on the water he is powerless except at night even
then he can onli summon fog and storm and snow and hi wolv but were
he wreck the live water would engulf him helpless and he would
inde be lost he could have the vessel drive to land but if it were
unfriendli land wherein he wa not free to move hi posit would
still be desper
we know from the record that he wa on the water so what we have to do
is to ascertain what water
the first thing is to realis exactli what he ha done as yet we mai
then get a light on what hi later task is to be
firstlyw must differenti between what he did in london as part
of hi gener plan of action when he wa press for moment and had
to arrang as best he could
secondli we must see as well as we can surmis it from the fact we
know of what he ha done here
as to the first he evid intend to arriv at galatz and sent
invoic to varna to deceiv us lest we should ascertain hi mean of
exit from england hi immedi and sole purpos then wa to escap
the proof of thi is the letter of instruct sent to immanuel
hildesheim to clear and take awai the box befor sunris there is
also the instruct to petrof skinski these we must onli guess at but
there must have been some letter or messag sinc skinski came to
hildesheim
that so far hi plan were success we know the czarina catherin
made a phenomen quick journeyso much so that captain donelson
suspicion were arous but hi superstit unit with hi canni
plai the count game for him and he ran with hi favour wind
through fog and all till he brought up blindfold at galatz that the
count arrang were well made ha been prove hildesheim clear
the box took it off and gave it to skinski skinski took itand here
we lose the trail we onli know that the box is somewher on the water
move along the custom and the octroi if there be ani have been
avoid
now we come to what the count must have done after hi arrivalon
land at galatz
the box wa given to skinski befor sunris at sunris the count could
appear in hi own form here we ask why skinski wa chosen at all to
aid in the work in my husband diari skinski is mention as deal
with the slovak who trade down the river to the port and the man
remark that the murder wa the work of a slovak show the gener
feel against hi class the count want isol
my surmis is thi that in london the count decid to get back to hi
castl by water as the most safe and secret wai he wa brought from
the castl by szgani and probabl thei deliv their cargo to slovak
who took the box to varna for there thei were ship for london
thu the count had knowledg of the person who could arrang thi
servic when the box wa on land befor sunris or after sunset he
came out from hi box met skinski and instruct him what to do as to
arrang the carriag of the box up some river when thi wa done and
he knew that all wa in train he blot out hi trace as he thought
by murder hi agent
i have examin the map and find that the river most suitabl for the
slovak to have ascend is either the pruth or the sereth i read in
the typescript that in my tranc i heard cow low and water swirl
level with my ear and the creak of wood the count in hi box then
wa on a river in an open boatpropel probabl either by oar or
pole for the bank ar near and it is work against stream there
would be no such sound if float down stream
of cours it mai not be either the sereth or the pruth but we mai
possibl investig further now of these two the pruth is the more
easili navig but the sereth is at fundu join by the bistritza
which run up round the borgo pass the loop it make is manifestli as
close to dracula castl as can be got by water

octob 30 nighti am write thi in the light from the furnac
door of the steam launch lord godalm is fire up he is an
experienc hand at the work as he ha had for year a launch of hi
own on the thame and anoth on the norfolk broad regard our
plan we final decid that mina guess wa correct and that if ani
waterwai wa chosen for the count escap back to hi castl the
sereth and then the bistritza at it junction would be the on we took
it that somewher about the 47th degre north latitud would be the
place chosen for the cross the countri between the river and the
carpathian we have no fear in run at good speed up the river at
night there is plenti of water and the bank ar wide enough apart to
make steam even in the dark easi enough lord godalm tell me to
sleep for a while as it is enough for the present for on to be on
watch but i cannot sleephow can i with the terribl danger hang
over my darl and her go out into that aw place my onli
comfort is that we ar in the hand of god onli for that faith it would
be easier to die than to live and so be quit of all the troubl mr
morri and dr seward were off on their long ride befor we start
thei ar to keep up the right bank far enough off to get on higher
land where thei can see a good stretch of river and avoid the follow
of it curv thei have for the first stage two men to ride and lead
their spare horsesfour in all so as not to excit curios when
thei dismiss the men which shall be shortli thei shall themselv look
after the hors it mai be necessari for us to join forc if so thei
can mount our whole parti on of the saddl ha a movabl horn and
can be easili adapt for mina if requir
it is a wild adventur we ar on here as we ar rush along through
the dark with the cold from the river seem to rise up and strike
us with all the mysteri voic of the night around us it all come
home we seem to be drift into unknown place and unknown wai into
a whole world of dark and dread thing godalm is shut the
furnac door
31 octoberstil hurri along the dai ha come and godalm is
sleep i am on watch the morn is bitterli cold the furnac heat
is grate though we have heavi fur coat as yet we have pass onli
a few open boat but none of them had on board ani box or packag of
anyth like the size of the on we seek the men were scare everi
time we turn our electr lamp on them and fell on their knee and
prai
1 novemb eveningno new all dai we have found noth of the
kind we seek we have now pass into the bistritza and if we ar wrong
in our surmis our chanc is gone we have overhaul everi boat big
and littl earli thi morn on crew took us for a govern boat
and treat us accordingli we saw in thi a wai of smooth matter
so at fundu where the bistritza run into the sereth we got a
roumanian flag which we now fly conspicu with everi boat which we
have overhaul sinc then thi trick ha succeed we have had everi
defer shown to us and not onc ani object to whatev we chose
to ask or do some of the slovak tell us that a big boat pass them
go at more than usual speed as she had a doubl crew on board thi
wa befor thei came to fundu so thei could not tell us whether the
boat turn into the bistritza or continu on up the sereth at fundu
we could not hear of ani such boat so she must have pass there in the
night i am feel veri sleepi the cold is perhap begin to tell
upon me and natur must have rest some time godalm insist that he
shall keep the first watch god bless him for all hi good to poor
dear mina and me
2 novemb morningit is broad daylight that good fellow would not
wake me he sai it would have been a sin to for i slept peacefulli and
wa forget my troubl it seem brutal selfish to me to have slept
so long and let him watch all night but he wa quit right i am a new
man thi morn and as i sit here and watch him sleep i can do
all that is necessari both as to mind the engin steer and
keep watch i can feel that my strength and energi ar come back to
me i wonder where mina is now and van hels thei should have got to
veresti about noon on wednesdai it would take them some time to get the
carriag and hors so if thei had start and travel hard thei
would be about now at the borgo pass god guid and help them i am
afraid to think what mai happen if we could onli go faster but we
cannot the engin ar throb and do their utmost i wonder how
dr seward and mr morri ar get on there seem to be endless
stream run down the mountain into thi river but as none of them
ar veri largeat present at all event though thei ar terribl
doubtless in winter and when the snow meltsth horsemen mai not have
met much obstruct i hope that befor we get to strasba we mai see
them for if by that time we have not overtaken the count it mai be
necessari to take counsel togeth what to do next
dr seward diari
2 novemberthre dai on the road no new and no time to write it
if there had been for everi moment is preciou we have had onli the
rest need for the hors but we ar both bear it wonderfulli
those adventur dai of our ar turn up us we must push on
we shall never feel happi till we get the launch in sight again
3 novemberw heard at fundu that the launch had gone up the
bistritza i wish it wasnt so cold there ar sign of snow come and
if it fall heavi it will stop us in such case we must get a sledg and
go on russian fashion
4 novembertodai we heard of the launch have been detain by an
accid when try to forc a wai up the rapid the slovak boat get
up all right by aid of a rope and steer with knowledg some went up
onli a few hour befor godalm is an amateur fitter himself and
evid it wa he who put the launch in trim again final thei got
up the rapid all right with local help and ar off on the chase
afresh i fear that the boat is not ani better for the accid the
peasantri tell us that after she got upon smooth water again she kept
stop everi now and again so long as she wa in sight we must push
on harder than ever our help mai be want soon

saw the sign of the dawn i got readi for the hypnot we stop our
carriag and got down so that there might be no disturb i made a
couch with fur and madam mina ly down yield herself as usual but
more slow and more short time than ever to the hypnot sleep as
befor came the answer dark and the swirl of water then she
woke bright and radiant and we go on our wai and soon reach the pass

guid power be in her manifest for she point to a road and sai
thi is the wai
how know you it i ask
of cours i know it she answer and with a paus add have not my
jonathan travel it and wrote of hi travel
at first i think somewhat strang but soon i see that there be onli on
such byroad it is us but littl and veri differ from the coach
road from the bukovina to bistritz which is more wide and hard and
more of us
so we came down thi road when we meet other waysnot alwai were we
sure that thei were road at all for thei be neglect and light snow
have fallenth hors know and thei onli i give rein to them and
thei go on so patient byandbi we find all the thing which jonathan
have note in that wonder diari of him then we go on for long long
hour and hour at the first i tell madam mina to sleep she try and
she succe she sleep all the time till at the last i feel myself to
suspici grow and attempt to wake her but she sleep on and i mai
not wake her though i try i do not wish to try too hard lest i harm
her for i know that she have suffer much and sleep at time be
allinal to her i think i drows myself for all of sudden i feel
guilt as though i have done someth i find myself bolt up with the
rein in my hand and the good hors go along jog jog just as ever i
look down and find madam mina still sleep it is now not far off sunset
time and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood
so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep
for we ar go up and up and all is oh so wild and rocki as though
it were the end of the world
then i arous madam mina thi time she wake with not much troubl and
then i try to put her to hypnot sleep but she sleep not be as
though i were not still i try and try till all at onc i find her and
myself in dark so i look round and find that the sun have gone down
madam mina laugh and i turn and look at her she is now quit awak
and look so well as i never saw her sinc that night at carfax when we
first enter the count hous i am amaz and not at eas then but she
is so bright and tender and thought for me that i forget all fear i
light a fire for we have brought suppli of wood with us and she
prepar food while i undo the hors and set them tether in shelter
to feed then when i return to the fire she have my supper readi i go
to help her but she smile and tell me that she have eat alreadythat
she wa so hungri that she would not wait i like it not and i have
grave doubt but i fear to affright her and so i am silent of it she
help me and i eat alon and then we wrap in fur and lie besid the
fire and i tell her to sleep while i watch but present i forget all
of watch and when i sudden rememb that i watch i find her ly
quiet but awak and look at me with so bright ey onc twice
more the same occur and i get much sleep till befor morn when i
wake i try to hypnotis her but ala though she shut her ey
obedi she mai not sleep the sun rise up and up and up and then
sleep come to her too late but so heavi that she will not wake i have
to lift her up and place her sleep in the carriag when i have
har the hors and made all readi madam still sleep and she look
in her sleep more healthi and more redder than befor and i like it
not and i am afraid afraid afraidi am afraid of all thingseven
to think but i must go on my wai the stake we plai for is life and
death or more than these and we must not flinch
5 novemb morninglet me be accur in everyth for though you
and i have seen some strang thing togeth you mai at the first think
that i van hels am madthat the mani horror and the so long
strain on nerv ha at the last turn my brain
all yesterdai we travel ever get closer to the mountain and
move into a more and more wild and desert land there ar great
frown precipic and much fall water and natur seem to have held
sometim her carniv madam mina still sleep and sleep and though i
did have hunger and appeas it i could not waken hereven for food i
began to fear that the fatal spell of the place wa upon her taint as
she is with that vampir baptism well said i to myself if it be
that she sleep all the dai it shall also be that i do not sleep at
night as we travel on the rough road for a road of an ancient and
imperfect kind there wa i held down my head and slept again i wake
with a sens of guilt and of time pass and found madam mina still
sleep and the sun low down but all wa inde chang the frown
mountain seem further awai and we were near the top of a
steepris hill on summit of which wa such a castl as jonathan tell
of in hi diari at onc i exult and fear for now for good or ill
the end wa near
i woke madam mina and again tri to hypnotis her but ala
unavail till too late then er the great dark came upon usfor
even after downsun the heaven reflect the gone sun on the snow and
all wa for a time in a great twilighti took out the hors and fed
them in what shelter i could then i make a fire and near it i make
madam mina now awak and more charm than ever sit comfort amid
her rug i got readi food but she would not eat simpli sai that
she had not hunger i did not press her know her unavailing but
i myself eat for i must need now be strong for all then with the
fear on me of what might be i drew a ring so big for her comfort round
where madam mina sat and over the ring i pass some of the wafer and
i broke it fine so that all wa well guard she sat still all the
timeso still as on dead and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the
snow wa not more pale and no word she said but when i drew near she
clung to me and i could know that the poor soul shook her from head to
feet with a tremor that wa pain to feel i said to her present when
she had grown more quiet
will you not come over to the fire for i wish to make a test of
what she could she rose obedi but when she have made a step she
stop and stood as on stricken
why not go on i ask she shook her head and come back sat
down in her place then look at me with open ey as of on wake
from sleep she said simpli
i cannot and remain silent i rejoic for i knew that what she
could not none of those that we dread could though there might be
danger to her bodi yet her soul wa safe
present the hors began to scream and tore at their tether till i
came to them and quiet them when thei did feel my hand on them thei
whinni low as in joi and lick at my hand and were quiet for a
time mani time through the night did i come to them till it arriv to
the cold hour when all natur is at lowest and everi time my come wa
with quiet of them in the cold hour the fire began to die and i wa
about step forth to replenish it for now the snow came in fly
sweep and with it a chill mist even in the dark there wa a light of
some kind as there ever is over snow and it seem as though the
snowflurri and the wreath of mist took shape as of women with
trail garment all wa in dead grim silenc onli that the hors
whinni and cower as if in terror of the worst i began to
fearhorr fear but then came to me the sens of safeti in that
ring wherein i stood i began too to think that my imagin were of
the night and the gloom and the unrest that i have gone through and
all the terribl anxieti it wa as though my memori of all jonathan
horrid experi were befool me for the snow flake and the mist
began to wheel and circl round till i could get as though a shadowi
glimps of those women that would have kiss him and then the hors
cower lower and lower and moan in terror as men do in pain even
the mad of fright wa not to them so that thei could break awai i
fear for my dear madam mina when these weird figur drew near and
circl round i look at her but she sat calm and smile at me when
i would have step to the fire to replenish it she caught me and held
me back and whisper like a voic that on hear in a dream so low
it wa
no no do not go without here you ar safe i turn to her and
look in her ey said
but you it is for you that i fear whereat she laugheda laugh low
and unreal and said
fear for me why fear for me none safer in all the world from them
than i am and as i wonder at the mean of her word a puff of
wind made the flame leap up and i see the red scar on her forehead
then ala i knew did i not i would soon have learn for the
wheel figur of mist and snow came closer but keep ever without
the holi circl then thei began to materialis tillif god have not
take awai my reason for i saw it through my eyesther were befor me
in actual flesh the same three women that jonathan saw in the room when
thei would have kiss hi throat i knew the swai round form the
bright hard ey the white teeth the ruddi colour the voluptu
lip thei smile ever at poor dear madam mina and as their laugh came
through the silenc of the night thei twine their arm and point to
her and said in those so sweet tingl tone that jonathan said were
of the intoler sweet of the waterglass
come sister come to us come come in fear i turn to my poor
madam mina and my heart with glad leapt like flame for oh the
terror in her sweet ey the repuls the horror told a stori to my
heart that wa all of hope god be thank she wa not yet of them i
seiz some of the firewood which wa by me and hold out some of the
wafer advanc on them toward the fire thei drew back befor me and
laugh their low horrid laugh i fed the fire and fear them not for
i knew that we were safe within our protect thei could not
approach me whilst so arm nor madam mina whilst she remain within
the ring which she could not leav no more than thei could enter the
hors had ceas to moan and lai still on the ground the snow fell on
them softli and thei grew whiter i knew that there wa for the poor
beast no more of terror
and so we remain till the red of the dawn to fall through the
snowgloom i wa desol and afraid and full of woe and terror but
when that beauti sun began to climb the horizon life wa to me again
at the first come of the dawn the horrid figur melt in the
whirl mist and snow the wreath of transpar gloom move awai
toward the castl and were lost
instinct with the dawn come i turn to madam mina intend
to hypnotis her but she lai in a deep and sudden sleep from which i
could not wake her i tri to hypnotis through her sleep but she made
no respons none at all and the dai broke i fear yet to stir i have
made my fire and have seen the hors thei ar all dead todai i have
much to do here and i keep wait till the sun is up high for there
mai be place where i must go where that sunlight though snow and mist
obscur it will be to me a safeti
i will strengthen me with breakfast and then i will to my terribl
work madam mina still sleep and god be thank she is calm in her
sleep

awai from the river with their leiterwagon thei surround it in a
cluster and hurri along as though beset the snow is fall lightli
and there is a strang excit in the air it mai be our own
feel but the depress is strang far off i hear the howl of
wolv the snow bring them down from the mountain and there ar
danger to all of us and from all side the hors ar nearli readi
and we ar soon off we ride to death of some on god alon know who

dr van hels memorandum
5 novemb afternooni am at least sane thank god for that merci
at all event though the prove it ha been dread when i left
madam mina sleep within the holi circl i took my wai to the castl
the blacksmith hammer which i took in the carriag from veresti wa
us though the door were all open i broke them off the rusti
hing lest some illint or illchanc should close them so that
be enter i might not get out jonathan bitter experi serv
me here by memori of hi diari i found my wai to the old chapel for i
knew that here my work lai the air wa oppress it seem as if
there wa some sulphur fume which at time made me dizzi either
there wa a roar in my ear or i heard afar off the howl of wolv
then i bethought me of my dear madam mina and i wa in terribl plight
the dilemma had me between hi horn
her i had not dare to take into thi place but left safe from the
vampir in that holi circl and yet even there would be the wolf i
resolv me that my work lai here and that as to the wolv we must
submit if it were god will at ani rate it wa onli death and
freedom beyond so did i choos for her had it but been for myself the
choic had been easi the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than
the grave of the vampir so i make my choic to go on with my work
i knew that there were at least three grave to findgrav that ar
inhabit so i search and search and i find on of them she lai in her
vampir sleep so full of life and voluptu beauti that i shudder as
though i have come to do murder ah i doubt not that in old time when
such thing were mani a man who set forth to do such a task as mine
found at the last hi heart fail him and then hi nerv so he delai
and delai and delai till the mere beauti and the fascin of the
wanton undead have hypnotis him and he remain on and on till sunset
come and the vampir sleep be over then the beauti ey of the fair
woman open and look love and the voluptu mouth present to a
kissand man is weak and there remain on more victim in the vampir
fold on more to swell the grim and grisli rank of the undead
there is some fascin sure when i am move by the mere presenc
of such an on even ly as she lai in a tomb fret with ag and
heavi with the dust of centuri though there be that horrid odour such
as the lair of the count have had ye i wa movedi van hels
with all my purpos and with my motiv for hatei wa move to a
yearn for delai which seem to paralys my faculti and to clog my
veri soul it mai have been that the need of natur sleep and the
strang oppress of the air were begin to overcom me certain it
wa that i wa laps into sleep the openei sleep of on who yield
to a sweet fascin when there came through the snowstil air a
long low wail so full of woe and piti that it woke me like the sound
of a clarion for it wa the voic of my dear madam mina that i heard
then i brace myself again to my horrid task and found by wrench
awai tombtop on other of the sister the other dark on i dare not
paus to look on her as i had on her sister lest onc more i should
begin to be enthral but i go on search until present i find in
a high great tomb as if made to on much belov that other fair sister
which like jonathan i had seen to gather herself out of the atom of
the mist she wa so fair to look on so radiantli beauti so
exquisit voluptu that the veri instinct of man in me which call
some of my sex to love and to protect on of her made my head whirl
with new emot but god be thank that soulwail of my dear madam
mina had not di out of my ear and befor the spell could be wrought
further upon me i had nerv myself to my wild work by thi time i had
search all the tomb in the chapel so far as i could tell and as
there had been onli three of these undead phantom around us in the
night i took it that there were no more of activ undead exist
there wa on great tomb more lordli than all the rest huge it wa and
nobli proport on it wa but on word
dracula
thi then wa the undead home of the kingvampir to whom so mani more
were due it empti spoke eloqu to make certain what i knew
befor i began to restor these women to their dead selv through my
aw work i laid in dracula tomb some of the wafer and so banish
him from it undead for ever
then began my terribl task and i dread it had it been but on it
had been easi compar but three to begin twice more after i had
been through a deed of horror for if it wa terribl with the sweet
miss luci what would it not be with these strang on who had surviv
through centuri and who had been strengthen by the pass of the
year who would if thei could have fought for their foul live
oh my friend john but it wa butcher work had i not been nerv by
thought of other dead and of the live over whom hung such a pall of
fear i could not have gone on i trembl and trembl even yet though
till all wa over god be thank my nerv did stand had i not seen
the repos in the first place and the glad that stole over it just
er the final dissolut came as realis that the soul had been
won i could not have gone further with my butcheri i could not have
endur the horrid screech as the stake drove home the plung of
writh form and lip of bloodi foam i should have fled in terror and
left my work undon but it is over and the poor soul i can piti them
now and weep as i think of them placid each in her full sleep of death
for a short moment er fade for friend john hardli had my knife
sever the head of each befor the whole bodi began to melt awai and
crumbl in to it nativ dust as though the death that should have come
centuri agon had at last assert himself and sai at onc and loud i
am here
befor i left the castl i so fix it entranc that never more can
the count enter there undead
when i step into the circl where madam mina slept she woke from her
sleep and see me cri out in pain that i had endur too much
come she said come awai from thi aw place let us go to meet my
husband who is i know come toward us she wa look thin and
pale and weak but her ey were pure and glow with fervour i wa
glad to see her pale and her ill for my mind wa full of the
fresh horror of that ruddi vampir sleep
and so with trust and hope and yet full of fear we go eastward to meet
our friendsand himwhom madam mina tell me that she know ar
come to meet us
mina harker journal
6 novemberit wa late in the afternoon when the professor and i
took our wai toward the east whenc i knew jonathan wa come we did
not go fast though the wai wa steepli downhil for we had to take
heavi rug and wrap with us we dare not face the possibl of be
left without warmth in the cold and the snow we had to take some of our
provis too for we were in a perfect desol and so far as we
could see through the snowfal there wa not even the sign of
habit when we had gone about a mile i wa tire with the heavi
walk and sat down to rest then we look back and saw where the
clear line of dracula castl cut the sky for we were so deep under
the hill whereon it wa set that the angl of perspect of the
carpathian mountain wa far below it we saw it in all it grandeur
perch a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipic and with
seemingli a great gap between it and the steep of the adjac mountain
on ani side there wa someth wild and uncanni about the place we
could hear the distant howl of wolv thei were far off but the
sound even though come muffl through the deaden snowfal wa
full of terror i knew from the wai dr van hels wa search about
that he wa try to seek some strateg point where we would be less
expos in case of attack the rough roadwai still led downward we
could trace it through the drift snow
in a littl while the professor signal to me so i got up and join
him he had found a wonder spot a sort of natur hollow in a rock
with an entranc like a doorwai between two boulder he took me by the
hand and drew me in see he said here you will be in shelter and
if the wolv do come i can meet them on by on he brought in our
fur and made a snug nest for me and got out some provis and
forc them upon me but i could not eat to even try to do so wa
repuls to me and much as i would have like to pleas him i could
not bring myself to the attempt he look veri sad but did not
reproach me take hi fieldglass from the case he stood on the top
of the rock and began to search the horizon suddenli he call out
look madam mina look look i sprang up and stood besid him on the
rock he hand me hi glass and point the snow wa now fall
more heavili and swirl about fierc for a high wind wa begin
to blow howev there were time when there were paus between the
snow flurri and i could see a long wai round from the height where we
were it wa possibl to see a great distanc and far off beyond the
white wast of snow i could see the river ly like a black ribbon in
kink and curl as it wound it wai straight in front of us and not far
offin fact so near that i wonder we had not notic beforecam a
group of mount men hurri along in the midst of them wa a cart a
long leiterwagon which swept from side to side like a dog tail
wag with each stern inequ of the road outlin against the
snow as thei were i could see from the men cloth that thei were
peasant or gypsi of some kind
on the cart wa a great squar chest my heart leap as i saw it for i
felt that the end wa come the even wa now draw close and
well i knew that at sunset the thing which wa till then imprison
there would take new freedom and could in ani of mani form elud all
pursuit in fear i turn to the professor to my constern
howev he wa not there an instant later i saw him below me round
the rock he had drawn a circl such as we had found shelter in last
night when he had complet it he stood besid me again sai
at least you shall be safe here from him he took the glass from
me and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us
see he said thei come quickli thei ar flog the hors and
gallop as hard as thei can he paus and went on in a hollow
voic
thei ar race for the sunset we mai be too late god will be
done down came anoth blind rush of drive snow and the whole
landscap wa blot out it soon pass howev and onc more hi
glass were fix on the plain then came a sudden cry
look look look see two horsemen follow fast come up from the
south it must be quincei and john take the glass look befor the snow
blot it all out i took it and look the two men might be dr seward
and mr morri i knew at all event that neither of them wa jonathan
at the same time i knew that jonathan wa not far off look around
i saw on the north side of the come parti two other men ride at
breakneck speed on of them i knew wa jonathan and the other i took
of cours to be lord godalm thei too were pursu the parti with
the cart when i told the professor he shout in glee like a schoolboi
and after look intent till a snow fall made sight imposs he
laid hi winchest rifl readi for us against the boulder at the
open of our shelter thei ar all converg he said when the
time come we shall have gypsi on all side i got out my revolv
readi to hand for whilst we were speak the howl of wolv came
louder and closer when the snow storm abat a moment we look again
it wa strang to see the snow fall in such heavi flake close to us
and beyond the sun shine more and more brightli as it sank down
toward the far mountain top sweep the glass all around us i could
see here and there dot move singli and in two and three and larger
numbersth wolv were gather for their prei
everi instant seem an ag whilst we wait the wind came now in
fierc burst and the snow wa driven with furi as it swept upon us in
circl eddi at time we could not see an arm length befor us
but at other as the hollowsound wind swept by us it seem to
clear the airspac around us so that we could see afar off we had of
late been so accustom to watch for sunris and sunset that we knew
with fair accuraci when it would be and we knew that befor long the
sun would set it wa hard to believ that by our watch it wa less
than an hour that we wait in that rocki shelter befor the variou
bodi began to converg close upon us the wind came now with fiercer
and more bitter sweep and more steadili from the north it seemingli
had driven the snow cloud from us for with onli occasion burst
the snow fell we could distinguish clearli the individu of each
parti the pursu and the pursuer strang enough those pursu did
not seem to realis or at least to care that thei were pursu thei
seem howev to hasten with redoubl speed as the sun drop lower
and lower on the mountain top
closer and closer thei drew the professor and i crouch down behind
our rock and held our weapon readi i could see that he wa determin
that thei should not pass on and all were quit unawar of our
presenc
all at onc two voic shout out to halt on wa my jonathan
rais in a high kei of passion the other mr morri strong resolut
tone of quiet command the gypsi mai not have known the languag but
there wa no mistak the tone in whatev tongu the word were
spoken instinct thei rein in and at the instant lord godalm
and jonathan dash up at on side and dr seward and mr morri on the
other the leader of the gypsi a splendidlook fellow who sat hi
hors like a centaur wave them back and in a fierc voic gave to hi
companion some word to proce thei lash the hors which sprang
forward but the four men rais their winchest rifl and in an
unmistak wai command them to stop at the same moment dr van
hels and i rose behind the rock and point our weapon at them
see that thei were surround the men tighten their rein and drew
up the leader turn to them and gave a word at which everi man of the
gypsi parti drew what weapon he carri knife or pistol and held
himself in readi to attack issu wa join in an instant
the leader with a quick movement of hi rein threw hi hors out in
front and point first to the sunnow close down on the hill
topsand then to the castl said someth which i did not understand
for answer all four men of our parti threw themselv from their hors
and dash toward the cart i should have felt terribl fear at see
jonathan in such danger but that the ardour of battl must have been
upon me as well as the rest of them i felt no fear but onli a wild
surg desir to do someth see the quick movement of our
parti the leader of the gypsi gave a command hi men instantli
form round the cart in a sort of undisciplin endeavour each on
shoulder and push the other in hi eager to carri out the
order
in the midst of thi i could see that jonathan on on side of the ring
of men and quincei on the other were forc a wai to the cart it wa
evid that thei were bent on finish their task befor the sun
should set noth seem to stop or even to hinder them neither the
level weapon nor the flash knive of the gypsi in front nor
the howl of the wolv behind appear to even attract their
attent jonathan impetuos and the manifest singl of hi
purpos seem to overaw those in front of him instinct thei
cower asid and let him pass in an instant he had jump upon the
cart and with a strength which seem incred rais the great
box and flung it over the wheel to the ground in the meantim mr
morri had had to us forc to pass through hi side of the ring of
szgani all the time i had been breathlessli watch jonathan i had
with the tail of my ey seen him press desper forward and had
seen the knive of the gypsi flash as he won a wai through them and
thei cut at him he had parri with hi great bowi knife and at first
i thought that he too had come through in safeti but as he sprang
besid jonathan who had by now jump from the cart i could see that
with hi left hand he wa clutch at hi side and that the blood wa
spurt through hi finger he did not delai notwithstand thi for
as jonathan with desper energi attack on end of the chest
attempt to prize off the lid with hi great kukri knife he attack
the other frantic with hi bowi under the effort of both men the
lid began to yield the nail drew with a quick screech sound and
the top of the box wa thrown back
by thi time the gypsi see themselv cover by the winchest
and at the merci of lord godalm and dr seward had given in and made
no resist the sun wa almost down on the mountain top and the
shadow of the whole group fell long upon the snow i saw the count
ly within the box upon the earth some of which the rude fall from
the cart had scatter over him he wa deathli pale just like a waxen
imag and the red ey glare with the horribl vindict look which i
knew too well
as i look the ey saw the sink sun and the look of hate in them
turn to triumph
but on the instant came the sweep and flash of jonathan great knife
i shriek as i saw it shear through the throat whilst at the same
moment mr morriss bowi knife plung into the heart
it wa like a miracl but befor our veri ey and almost in the
draw of a breath the whole bodi crumbl into dust and pass from
our sight
i shall be glad as long as i live that even in that moment of final
dissolut there wa in the face a look of peac such as i never
could have imagin might have rest there
the castl of dracula now stood out against the red sky and everi stone
of it broken battlement wa articul against the light of the
set sun
the gypsi take us as in some wai the caus of the extraordinari
disappear of the dead man turn without a word and rode awai as
if for their live those who were unmount jump upon the
leiterwagon and shout to the horsemen not to desert them the wolv
which had withdrawn to a safe distanc follow in their wake leav
us alon
mr morri who had sunk to the ground lean on hi elbow hold hi
hand press to hi side the blood still gush through hi finger i
flew to him for the holi circl did not now keep me back so did the
two doctor jonathan knelt behind him and the wound man laid back hi
head on hi shoulder with a sigh he took with a feebl effort my hand
in that of hi own which wa unstain he must have seen the anguish of
my heart in my face for he smile at me and said
i am onli too happi to have been of ani servic oh god he cri
suddenli struggl up to a sit postur and point to me it wa
worth for thi to die look look
the sun wa now right down upon the mountain top and the red gleam
fell upon my face so that it wa bath in rosi light with on impuls
the men sank on their knee and a deep and earnest amen broke from all
as their ey follow the point of hi finger the dy man
spoke
now god be thank that all ha not been in vain see the snow is not
more stainless than her forehead the curs ha pass awai
and to our bitter grief with a smile and in silenc he di a
gallant gentleman
note
seven year ago we all went through the flame and the happi of
some of us sinc then is we think well worth the pain we endur it
is an ad joi to mina and to me that our boi birthdai is the same
dai as that on which quincei morri di hi mother hold i know the
secret belief that some of our brave friend spirit ha pass into
him hi bundl of name link all our littl band of men togeth but
we call him quincei
in the summer of thi year we made a journei to transylvania and went
over the old ground which wa and is to us so full of vivid and
terribl memori it wa almost imposs to believ that the thing
which we had seen with our own ey and heard with our own ear were
live truth everi trace of all that had been wa blot out the
castl stood as befor rear high abov a wast of desol
when we got home we were talk of the old timewhich we could all
look back on without despair for godalm and seward ar both happili
marri i took the paper from the safe where thei had been ever sinc
our return so long ago we were struck with the fact that in all the
mass of materi of which the record is compos there is hardli on
authent document noth but a mass of typewrit except the later
notebook of mina and seward and myself and van hels memorandum
we could hardli ask ani on even did we wish to to accept these as
proof of so wild a stori van hels sum it all up as he said with
our boi on hi knee
we want no proof we ask none to believ us thi boi will some dai
know what a brave and gallant woman hi mother is alreadi he know her
sweet and love care later on he will understand how some men so
love her that thei did dare much for her sake
