i do not find it easi to get suffici far awai from thi book in
the first sensat of have finish it to refer to it with the
composur which thi formal head would seem to requir my interest
in it is so recent and strong and my mind is so divid between
pleasur and regretpleasur in the achiev of a long design
regret in the separ from mani companionsthat i am in danger of
weari the reader whom i love with person confid and privat
emot
besid which all that i could sai of the stori to ani purpos i have
endeavour to sai in it
it would concern the reader littl perhap to know how sorrowfulli
the pen is laid down at the close of a twoyear imagin task or
how an author feel as if he were dismiss some portion of himself
into the shadowi world when a crowd of the creatur of hi brain
ar go from him for ever yet i have noth els to tell unless
inde i were to confess which might be of less moment still that no
on can ever believ thi narr in the read more than i have
believ it in the write
instead of look back therefor i will look forward i cannot close
thi volum more agreeabl to myself than with a hope glanc toward
the time when i shall again put forth my two green leav onc a month
and with a faith remembr of the genial sun and shower that have

prefac to the charl dicken edit
i remark in the origin prefac to thi book that i did not find it
easi to get suffici far awai from it in the first sensat of
have finish it to refer to it with the composur which thi formal
head would seem to requir my interest in it wa so recent and
strong and my mind wa so divid between pleasur and regretpleasur
in the achiev of a long design regret in the separ from mani
companionsthat i wa in danger of weari the reader with person
confid and privat emot
besid which all that i could have said of the stori to ani purpos i
had endeavour to sai in it
it would concern the reader littl perhap to know how sorrowfulli the
pen is laid down at the close of a twoyear imagin task or how
an author feel as if he were dismiss some portion of himself into
the shadowi world when a crowd of the creatur of hi brain ar go
from him for ever yet i had noth els to tell unless inde i
were to confess which might be of less moment still that no on can
ever believ thi narr in the read more than i believ it in
the write
so true ar these avow at the present dai that i can now onli take
the reader into on confid more of all my book i like thi the
best it will be easili believ that i am a fond parent to everi child
of my fanci and that no on can ever love that famili as dearli as i
love them but like mani fond parent i have in my heart of heart a
favourit child and hi name is

the person histori and experi of david copperfield the younger
chapter 1 i am born
whether i shall turn out to be the hero of my own life or whether that
station will be held by anybodi els these page must show to begin my
life with the begin of my life i record that i wa born as i have
been inform and believ on a fridai at twelv oclock at night
it wa remark that the clock began to strike and i began to cry
simultan
in consider of the dai and hour of my birth it wa declar by
the nurs and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a
live interest in me sever month befor there wa ani possibl
of our becom person acquaint first that i wa destin to be
unlucki in life and secondli that i wa privileg to see ghost and
spirit both these gift inevit attach as thei believ to
all unlucki infant of either gender born toward the small hour on a
fridai night
i need sai noth here on the first head becaus noth can show
better than my histori whether that predict wa verifi or falsifi
by the result on the second branch of the question i will onli remark
that unless i ran through that part of my inherit while i wa still
a babi i have not come into it yet but i do not at all complain of
have been kept out of thi properti and if anybodi els should be in
the present enjoy of it he is heartili welcom to keep it
i wa born with a caul which wa advertis for sale in the
newspap at the low price of fifteen guinea whether seago
peopl were short of monei about that time or were short of faith and
prefer cork jacket i dont know all i know is that there wa but
on solitari bid and that wa from an attornei connect with the
billbrok busi who offer two pound in cash and the balanc
in sherri but declin to be guarante from drown on ani higher
bargain consequ the advertis wa withdrawn at a dead
lossfor as to sherri my poor dear mother own sherri wa in the
market thenand ten year afterward the caul wa put up in a raffl
down in our part of the countri to fifti member at halfacrown a
head the winner to spend five shill i wa present myself and i
rememb to have felt quit uncomfort and confus at a part of
myself be dispos of in that wai the caul wa won i recollect by
an old ladi with a handbasket who veri reluctantli produc from it
the stipul five shill all in halfpenc and twopenc halfpenni
shorta it took an immens time and a great wast of arithmet to
endeavour without ani effect to prove to her it is a fact which will
be long rememb as remark down there that she wa never drown
but di triumphantli in bed at ninetytwo i have understood that it
wa to the last her proudest boast that she never had been on the
water in her life except upon a bridg and that over her tea to which
she wa extrem partial she to the last express her indign
at the impieti of marin and other who had the presumpt to go
meander about the world it wa in vain to repres to her
that some conveni tea perhap includ result from thi
objection practic she alwai return with greater emphasi and
with an instinct knowledg of the strength of her object let us
have no meander
not to meander myself at present i will go back to my birth
i wa born at blunderston in suffolk or there by as thei sai in
scotland i wa a posthum child my father ey had close upon
the light of thi world six month when mine open on it there is
someth strang to me even now in the reflect that he never saw
me and someth stranger yet in the shadowi remembr that i have
of my first childish associ with hi white graveston in the
churchyard and of the indefin compass i us to feel for it
ly out alon there in the dark night when our littl parlour
wa warm and bright with fire and candl and the door of our hous
werealmost cruelli it seem to me sometimesbolt and lock
against it
an aunt of my father and consequ a greataunt of mine of whom
i shall have more to relat by and by wa the princip magnat of our
famili miss trotwood or miss betsei as my poor mother alwai call
her when she suffici overcam her dread of thi formid
personag to mention her at all which wa seldom had been marri
to a husband younger than herself who wa veri handsom except in the
sens of the home adag handsom is that handsom doesfor he
wa strongli suspect of have beaten miss betsei and even of have
onc on a disput question of suppli made some hasti but determin
arrang to throw her out of a two pair of stair window these
evid of an incompat of temper induc miss betsei to pai him
off and effect a separ by mutual consent he went to india with
hi capit and there accord to a wild legend in our famili he wa
onc seen ride on an eleph in compani with a baboon but i think
it must have been a babooor a begum anyhow from india tide of hi
death reach home within ten year how thei affect my aunt nobodi
knew for immedi upon the separ she took her maiden name
again bought a cottag in a hamlet on the seacoast a long wai off
establish herself there as a singl woman with on servant and
wa understood to live seclud ever afterward in an inflex
retir
my father had onc been a favourit of her i believ but she wa
mortal affront by hi marriag on the ground that my mother wa a
wax doll she had never seen my mother but she knew her to be not
yet twenti my father and miss betsei never met again he wa doubl
my mother ag when he marri and of but a delic constitut he
di a year afterward and as i have said six month befor i came
into the world
thi wa the state of matter on the afternoon of what i mai be
excus for call that event and import fridai i can make no
claim therefor to have known at that time how matter stood or to
have ani remembr found on the evid of my own sens of what
follow
my mother wa sit by the fire but poorli in health and veri low in
spirit look at it through her tear and despond heavili about
herself and the fatherless littl stranger who wa alreadi welcom by
some gross of prophet pin in a drawer upstair to a world not at
all excit on the subject of hi arriv my mother i sai wa sit
by the fire that bright windi march afternoon veri timid and sad and
veri doubt of ever come aliv out of the trial that wa befor her
when lift her ey as she dri them to the window opposit she
saw a strang ladi come up the garden
my mother had a sure forebod at the second glanc that it wa
miss betsei the set sun wa glow on the strang ladi over the
gardenf and she came walk up to the door with a fell rigid
of figur and composur of counten that could have belong to
nobodi els
when she reach the hous she gave anoth proof of her ident
my father had often hint that she seldom conduct herself like ani
ordinari christian and now instead of ring the bell she came and
look in at that ident window press the end of her nose against
the glass to that extent that my poor dear mother us to sai it becam
perfectli flat and white in a moment
she gave my mother such a turn that i have alwai been convinc i am
indebt to miss betsei for have been born on a fridai
my mother had left her chair in her agit and gone behind it in
the corner miss betsei look round the room slowli and inquiringli
began on the other side and carri her ey on like a saracen head

portent appear sit befor the fire with her bonnet ti
over her left arm stop her ear with jewel cotton peggotti
know noth about her and my mother sai noth about her
she wa quit a mysteri in the parlour and the fact of her have a
magazin of jewel cotton in her pocket and stick the articl
in her ear in that wai did not detract from the solemn of her
presenc
the doctor have been upstair and come down again and have
satisfi himself i suppos that there wa a probabl of thi
unknown ladi and himself have to sit there face to face for some
hour laid himself out to be polit and social he wa the meekest of
hi sex the mildest of littl men he sidl in and out of a room to
take up the less space he walk as softli as the ghost in hamlet
and more slowli he carri hi head on on side partli in modest
depreci of himself partli in modest propiti of everybodi
els it is noth to sai that he hadnt a word to throw at a dog he
couldnt have thrown a word at a mad dog he might have offer him on
gentli or half a on or a fragment of on for he spoke as slowli as
he walk but he wouldnt have been rude to him and he couldnt have
been quick with him for ani earthli consider

in the dark and a strong draught until he wa again sent for
ham peggotti who went to the nation school and wa a veri dragon at
hi catech and who mai therefor be regard as a credibl wit
report next dai that happen to peep in at the parlourdoor an hour
after thi he wa instantli descri by miss betsei then walk to

hi escap that there were now occasion sound of feet and voic
overhead which he infer the cotton did not exclud from the
circumst of hi evid be clutch by the ladi as a victim on
whom to expend her superabund agit when the sound were loudest
that march him constantli up and down by the collar as if he had
been take too much laudanum she at those time shook him rumpl
hi hair made light of hi linen stop hi ear as if she confound
them with her own and otherwis tousl and maltreat him thi wa
in part confirm by hi aunt who saw him at half past twelv oclock
soon after hi releas and affirm that he wa then as red as i wa
the mild mr chillip could not possibl bear malic at such a time if
at ani time he sidl into the parlour as soon as he wa at liberti
and said to my aunt in hi meekest manner
well maam i am happi to congratul you

mr chillip wa flutter again by the extrem sever of my aunt
manner so he made her a littl bow and gave her a littl smile to
mollifi her
merci on the man what he do cri my aunt impati cant
he speak

there is no longer ani occas for uneasi maam be calm
it ha sinc been consid almost a miracl that my aunt didnt shake

head at him but in a wai that made him quail
well maam resum mr chillip as soon as he had courag i am
happi to congratul you all is now over maam and well over
dure the five minut or so that mr chillip devot to the deliveri
of thi orat my aunt ei him narrowli
how is she said my aunt fold her arm with her bonnet still ti

chillip quit as comfort as we can expect a young mother to be
under these melancholi domest circumst there cannot be ani
object to your see her present maam it mai do her good
and she how is she said my aunt sharpli
mr chillip laid hi head a littl more on on side and look at my
aunt like an amiabl bird

boi
my aunt said never a word but took her bonnet by the string in the
manner of a sling aim a blow at mr chillip head with it put it on
bent walk out and never came back she vanish like a discont
fairi or like on of those supernatur be whom it wa popularli
suppos i wa entitl to see and never came back ani more
no i lai in my basket and my mother lai in her bed but betsei
trotwood copperfield wa for ever in the land of dream and shadow the
tremend region whenc i had so late travel and the light upon
the window of our room shone out upon the earthli bourn of all such
travel and the mound abov the ash and the dust that onc wa he
without whom i had never been
chapter 2 i observ
the first object that assum a distinct presenc befor me as i look
far back into the blank of my infanc ar my mother with her pretti
hair and youth shape and peggotti with no shape at all and ey so
dark that thei seem to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face
and cheek and arm so hard and red that i wonder the bird didnt
peck her in prefer to appl
i believ i can rememb these two at a littl distanc apart dwarf
to my sight by stoop down or kneel on the floor and i go
unsteadili from the on to the other i have an impress on my mind
which i cannot distinguish from actual remembr of the touch of
peggotti forefing as she us to hold it out to me and of it be
roughen by needlework like a pocket nutmeggrat
thi mai be fanci though i think the memori of most of us can go
farther back into such time than mani of us suppos just as i believ
the power of observ in number of veri young children to be quit
wonder for it close and accuraci inde i think that most
grown men who ar remark in thi respect mai with greater proprieti
be said not to have lost the faculti than to have acquir it the
rather as i gener observ such men to retain a certain fresh
and gentl and capac of be pleas which ar also an
inherit thei have preserv from their childhood
i might have a misgiv that i am meander in stop to sai thi
but that it bring me to remark that i build these conclus in part
upon my own experi of myself and if it should appear from
anyth i mai set down in thi narr that i wa a child of close
observ or that as a man i have a strong memori of my childhood i
undoubtedli lai claim to both of these characterist
look back as i wa sai into the blank of my infanc the first
object i can rememb as stand out by themselv from a confus of
thing ar my mother and peggotti what els do i rememb let me see
there come out of the cloud our housenot new to me but quit
familiar in it earliest remembr on the groundfloor is peggotti
kitchen open into a back yard with a pigeonhous on a pole in
the centr without ani pigeon in it a great dogkennel in a corner
without ani dog and a quantiti of fowl that look terribl tall to me
walk about in a menac and feroci manner there is on cock who
get upon a post to crow and seem to take particular notic of me as
i look at him through the kitchen window who make me shiver he is so
fierc of the gees outsid the sideg who come waddl after
me with their long neck stretch out when i go that wai i dream at
night as a man environ by wild beast might dream of lion
here is a long passagewhat an enorm perspect i make of
itlead from peggotti kitchen to the front door a dark
storeroom open out of it and that is a place to be run past at
night for i dont know what mai be among those tub and jar and old
teachest when there is nobodi in there with a dimlyburn light
let a mouldi air come out of the door in which there is the smell
of soap pickl pepper candl and coffe all at on whiff then
there ar the two parlour the parlour in which we sit of an even
my mother and i and peggottyfor peggotti is quit our companion when
her work is done and we ar aloneand the best parlour where we sit
on a sundai grandli but not so comfort there is someth of a
dole air about that room to me for peggotti ha told mei dont
know when but appar ag agoabout my father funer and the
compani have their black cloak put on on sundai night my mother
read to peggotti and me in there how lazaru wa rais up from the
dead and i am so frighten that thei ar afterward oblig to take me
out of bed and show me the quiet churchyard out of the bedroom window
with the dead all ly in their grave at rest below the solemn moon
there is noth half so green that i know anywher as the grass of
that churchyard noth half so shadi as it tree noth half so
quiet as it tombston the sheep ar feed there when i kneel up
earli in the morn in my littl bed in a closet within my mother
room to look out at it and i see the red light shine on the
sundial and think within myself is the sundial glad i wonder that
it can tell the time again
here is our pew in the church what a highback pew with a window
near it out of which our hous can be seen and is seen mani time
dure the morn servic by peggotti who like to make herself
as sure as she can that it not be rob or is not in flame but
though peggotti ey wander she is much offend if mine doe
and frown to me as i stand upon the seat that i am to look at the
clergyman but i cant alwai look at himi know him without that white
thing on and i am afraid of hi wonder why i stare so and perhap
stop the servic to inquireand what am i to do it a dread
thing to gape but i must do someth i look at my mother but she
pretend not to see me i look at a boi in the aisl and he make face
at me i look at the sunlight come in at the open door through
the porch and there i see a strai sheepi dont mean a sinner but
muttonhalf make up hi mind to come into the church i feel that
if i look at him ani longer i might be tempt to sai someth out
loud and what would becom of me then i look up at the monument
tablet on the wall and try to think of mr bodger late of thi
parish and what the feel of mr bodger must have been when
afflict sore long time mr bodger bore and physician were in
vain i wonder whether thei call in mr chillip and he wa in vain
and if so how he like to be remind of it onc a week i look from
mr chillip in hi sundai neckcloth to the pulpit and think what a
good place it would be to plai in and what a castl it would make with
anoth boi come up the stair to attack it and have the velvet
cushion with the tassel thrown down on hi head in time my ey
gradual shut up and from seem to hear the clergyman sing a
drowsi song in the heat i hear noth until i fall off the seat with
a crash and am taken out more dead than aliv by peggotti
and now i see the outsid of our hous with the lattic
bedroomwindow stand open to let in the sweetsmel air and the
rag old rooksnest still dangl in the elmtre at the bottom
of the front garden now i am in the garden at the back beyond the
yard where the empti pigeonhous and dogkennel area veri preserv
of butterfli as i rememb it with a high fenc and a gate and
padlock where the fruit cluster on the tree riper and richer than
fruit ha ever been sinc in ani other garden and where my
mother gather some in a basket while i stand by bolt furtiv
gooseberri and try to look unmov a great wind rise and the
summer is gone in a moment we ar plai in the winter twilight
danc about the parlour when my mother is out of breath and rest
herself in an elbowchair i watch her wind her bright curl round
her finger and straiten her waist and nobodi know better than i
do that she like to look so well and is proud of be so pretti
that is among my veri earliest impress that and a sens that we
were both a littl afraid of peggotti and submit ourselv in most
thing to her direct were among the first opinionsif thei mai be
so calledthat i ever deriv from what i saw
peggotti and i were sit on night by the parlour fire alon i
had been read to peggotti about crocodil i must have read veri
perspicu or the poor soul must have been deepli interest for i
rememb she had a cloudi impress after i had done that thei were
a sort of veget i wa tire of read and dead sleepi but
have leav as a high treat to sit up until my mother came home from
spend the even at a neighbour i would rather have di upon
my post of cours than have gone to bed i had reach that stage of
sleepi when peggotti seem to swell and grow immens larg
i prop my eyelid open with my two forefing and look
perseveringli at her as she sat at work at the littl bit of waxcandl
she kept for her threadhow old it look be so wrinkl in
all directionsat the littl hous with a thatch roof where the
yardmeasur live at her workbox with a slide lid with a view of
st paul cathedr with a pink dome paint on the top at the brass
thimbl on her finger at herself whom i thought love i felt so
sleepi that i knew if i lost sight of anyth for a moment i wa
gone
peggotti sai i suddenli were you ever marri
lord master davi repli peggotti what put marriag in your
head
she answer with such a start that it quit awok me and then she
stop in her work and look at me with her needl drawn out to it
thread length
but were you ever marri peggotti sai i you ar a veri handsom
woman ant you
i thought her in a differ style from my mother certainli but of
anoth school of beauti i consid her a perfect exampl there
wa a red velvet footstool in the best parlour on which my mother
had paint a nosegai the groundwork of that stool and peggotti
complexion appear to me to be on and the same thing the stool wa
smooth and peggotti wa rough but that made no differ
me handsom davi said peggotti lawk no my dear but what put
marriag in your head
i dont knowyou mustnt marri more than on person at a time mai

but if you marri a person and the person di why then you mai marri
anoth person maynt you peggotti
you mai sai peggotti if you choos my dear that a matter of
opinion
but what is your opinion peggotti said i
i ask her and look curious at her becaus she look so
curious at me
my opinion is said peggotti take her ey from me after a littl
indecis and go on with her work that i never wa marri myself
master davi and that i dont expect to be that all i know about the
subject
you ant cross i suppos peggotti ar you said i after sit

mistaken for she laid asid her work which wa a stock of her own
and open her arm wide took my curli head within them and gave it
a good squeez i know it wa a good squeez becaus be veri plump
whenev she made ani littl exert after she wa dress some of the
button on the back of her gown flew off and i recollect two burst
to the opposit side of the parlour while she wa hug me
now let me hear some more about the crorkindil said peggotti who
wa not quit right in the name yet for i ant heard half enough
i couldnt quit understand why peggotti look so queer or why she
wa so readi to go back to the crocodil howev we return to those
monster with fresh wake on my part and we left their egg in
the sand for the sun to hatch and we ran awai from them and baffl
them by constantli turn which thei were unabl to do quickli on
account of their unwieldi make and we went into the water after them
as nativ and put sharp piec of timber down their throat and in
short we ran the whole crocodil gauntlet i did at least but i had
my doubt of peggotti who wa thoughtfulli stick her needl into
variou part of her face and arm all the time
we had exhaust the crocodil and begun with the allig when
the gardenbel rang we went out to the door and there wa my mother
look unusu pretti i thought and with her a gentleman with
beauti black hair and whisker who had walk home with us from
church last sundai

than a monarchor someth like that for my later understand

at thi minut i see him turn round in the garden and give us a last
look with hi illomen black ey befor the door wa shut
peggotti who had not said a word or move a finger secur the
fasten instantli and we all went into the parlour my mother

cruel selfish bad mama sai i am my child sai ye dear boi and

at thi we all fell acri togeth i think i wa the loudest of
the parti but i am sure we were all sincer about it i wa quit
heartbroken myself and am afraid that in the first transport of
wound tender i call peggotti a beast that honest creatur wa
in deep afflict i rememb and must have becom quit buttonless
on the occas for a littl vollei of those explos went off
when after have made it up with my mother she kneel down by the
elbowchair and made it up with me
we went to bed greatli deject my sob kept wake me for a long
time and when on veri strong sob quit hoist me up in bed i found
my mother sit on the coverlet and lean over me i fell asleep in
her arm after that and slept soundli
whether it wa the follow sundai when i saw the gentleman again
or whether there wa ani greater laps of time befor he reappear
i cannot recal i dont profess to be clear about date but there he
wa in church and he walk home with us afterward he came in too
to look at a famou geranium we had in the parlourwindow it did not
appear to me that he took much notic of it but befor he went he ask
my mother to give him a bit of the blossom she beg him to choos it
for himself but he refus to do thati could not understand whyso
she pluck it for him and gave it into hi hand he said he would
never never part with it ani more and i thought he must be quit a
fool not to know that it would fall to piec in a dai or two
peggotti began to be less with us of an even than she had alwai
been my mother defer to her veri muchmor than usual it occur
to meand we were all three excel friend still we were differ
from what we us to be and were not so comfort among ourselv
sometim i fanci that peggotti perhap object to my mother
wear all the pretti dress she had in her drawer or to her
go so often to visit at that neighbour but i couldnt to my
satisfact make out how it wa
gradual i becam us to see the gentleman with the black
whisker i like him no better than at first and had the same uneasi
jealousi of him but if i had ani reason for it beyond a child
instinct dislik and a gener idea that peggotti and i could make
much of my mother without ani help it certainli wa not the reason that
i might have found if i had been older no such thing came into my mind
or near it i could observ in littl piec as it were but as to
make a net of a number of these piec and catch anybodi in it
that wa as yet beyond me
on autumn morn i wa with my mother in the front garden when mr
murdstonei knew him by that name nowcam by on horseback he rein
up hi hors to salut my mother and said he wa go to lowestoft to
see some friend who were there with a yacht and merrili propos to
take me on the saddl befor him if i would like the ride
the air wa so clear and pleasant and the hors seem to like the
idea of the ride so much himself as he stood snort and paw at the
gardeng that i had a great desir to go so i wa sent upstair
to peggotti to be made spruce and in the meantim mr murdston
dismount and with hi hors bridl drawn over hi arm walk
slowli up and down on the outer side of the sweetbriar fenc while my
mother walk slowli up and down on the inner to keep him compani i
recollect peggotti and i peep out at them from my littl window i
recollect how close thei seem to be examin the sweetbriar between
them as thei stroll along and how from be in a perfectli angel
temper peggotti turn cross in a moment and brush my hair the wrong
wai excess hard
mr murdston and i were soon off and trot along on the green turf
by the side of the road he held me quit easili with on arm and i
dont think i wa restless usual but i could not make up my mind to
sit in front of him without turn my head sometim and look up in
hi face he had that kind of shallow black eyei want a better word to
express an ey that ha no depth in it to be look intowhich when
it is abstract seem from some peculiar of light to be disfigur
for a moment at a time by a cast sever time when i glanc at him
i observ that appear with a sort of aw and wonder what he
wa think about so close hi hair and whisker were blacker and
thicker look at so near than even i had given them credit for be
a squar about the lower part of hi face and the dot indic
of the strong black beard he shave close everi dai remind me of
the waxwork that had travel into our neighbourhood some halfayear
befor thi hi regular eyebrow and the rich white and black and
brown of hi complexionconfound hi complexion and hi memorymad
me think him in spite of my misgiv a veri handsom man i have no
doubt that my poor dear mother thought him so too
we went to an hotel by the sea where two gentlemen were smoke cigar
in a room by themselv each of them wa ly on at least four chair
and had a larg rough jacket on in a corner wa a heap of coat and
boatcloak and a flag all bundl up togeth
thei both roll on to their feet in an untidi sort of manner when we
came in and said halloa murdston we thought you were dead
not yet said mr murdston
and who thi shaver said on of the gentlemen take hold of me
that davi return mr murdston
davi who said the gentleman jone
copperfield said mr murdston
what bewitch mr copperfield encumbr cri the gentleman
the pretti littl widow
quinion said mr murdston take care if you pleas somebodi
sharp
who is ask the gentleman laugh i look up quickli be
curiou to know
onli brook of sheffield said mr murdston
i wa quit reliev to find that it wa onli brook of sheffield for
at first i realli thought it wa i
there seem to be someth veri comic in the reput of mr
brook of sheffield for both the gentlemen laugh heartili when he
wa mention and mr murdston wa a good deal amus also after some
laugh the gentleman whom he had call quinion said
and what is the opinion of brook of sheffield in refer to the
project busi
why i dont know that brook understand much about it at present
repli mr murdston but he is not gener favour i believ
there wa more laughter at thi and mr quinion said he would ring the
bell for some sherri in which to drink to brook thi he did and when
the wine came he made me have a littl with a biscuit and befor
i drank it stand up and sai confus to brook of sheffield the
toast wa receiv with great applaus and such hearti laughter that
it made me laugh too at which thei laugh the more in short we quit
enjoi ourselv
we walk about on the cliff after that and sat on the grass and
look at thing through a telescopei could make out noth myself
when it wa put to my ey but i pretend i couldand then we came
back to the hotel to an earli dinner all the time we were out the two
gentlemen smoke incessantlywhich i thought if i might judg from
the smell of their rough coat thei must have been do ever sinc
the coat had first come home from the tailor i must not forget that
we went on board the yacht where thei all three descend into the
cabin and were busi with some paper i saw them quit hard at work
when i look down through the open skylight thei left me dure thi
time with a veri nice man with a veri larg head of red hair and a veri
small shini hat upon it who had got a crossbar shirt or waistcoat
on with skylark in capit letter across the chest i thought it wa
hi name and that as he live on board ship and hadnt a street door
to put hi name on he put it there instead but when i call him mr
skylark he said it meant the vessel
i observ all dai that mr murdston wa graver and steadier than the
two gentlemen thei were veri gai and careless thei joke freeli with
on anoth but seldom with him it appear to me that he wa
more clever and cold than thei were and that thei regard him with
someth of my own feel i remark that onc or twice when mr
quinion wa talk he look at mr murdston sidewai as if to make
sure of hi not be displeas and that onc when mr passnidg the
other gentleman wa in high spirit he trod upon hi foot and gave
him a secret caution with hi ey to observ mr murdston who wa
sit stern and silent nor do i recollect that mr murdston laugh
at all that dai except at the sheffield jokeand that by the by wa
hi own
we went home earli in the even it wa a veri fine even and my
mother and he had anoth stroll by the sweetbriar while i wa sent in
to get my tea when he wa gone my mother ask me all about the dai i
had had and what thei had said and done i mention what thei had said
about her and she laugh and told me thei were impud fellow who
talk nonsensebut i knew it pleas her i knew it quit as well as
i know it now i took the opportun of ask if she wa at all
acquaint with mr brook of sheffield but she answer no onli she
suppos he must be a manufactur in the knife and fork wai
can i sai of her facealt as i have reason to rememb it perish
as i know it isthat it is gone when here it come befor me at thi
instant as distinct as ani face that i mai choos to look on in a
crowd street can i sai of her innoc and girlish beauti that it

fell that night can i sai she ever chang when my remembr bring
her back to life thu onli and truer to it love youth than i have
been or man ever is still hold fast what it cherish then
i write of her just as she wa when i had gone to bed after thi talk
and she came to bid me good night she kneel down playfulli by the
side of the bed and lai her chin upon her hand and laugh said
what wa it thei said davi tell me again i cant believ it

my mother put her hand upon my lip to stop me

well ma
dont tell peggotti she might be angri with them i am dreadfulli
angri with them myself but i would rather peggotti didnt know
i promis of cours and we kiss on anoth over and over again
and i soon fell fast asleep
it seem to me at thi distanc of time as if it were the next dai
when peggotti broach the strike and adventur proposit i am
about to mention but it wa probabl about two month afterward
we were sit as befor on even when my mother wa out as
befor in compani with the stock and the yardmeasur and the bit
of wax and the box with st paul on the lid and the crocodil book
when peggotti after look at me sever time and open her mouth
as if she were go to speak without do itwhich i thought wa
mere gape or i should have been rather alarmedsaid coaxingli
master davi how should you like to go along with me and spend a
fortnight at my brother at yarmouth wouldnt that be a treat
is your brother an agreeabl man peggotti i inquir provision
oh what an agreeabl man he is cri peggotti hold up her hand
then there the sea and the boat and ship and the fishermen and
the beach and am to plai with
peggotti meant her nephew ham mention in my first chapter but she
spoke of him as a morsel of english grammar
i wa flush by her summari of delight and repli that it would
inde be a treat but what would my mother sai
why then ill as good as bet a guinea said peggotti intent upon my
face that shell let us go ill ask her if you like as soon as ever
she come home there now
but what she to do while were awai said i put my small elbow
on the tabl to argu the point she cant live by herself
if peggotti were look for a hole all of a sudden in the heel of
that stock it must have been a veri littl on inde and not worth
darn
i sai peggotti she cant live by herself you know
oh bless you said peggotti look at me again at last dont
you know she go to stai for a fortnight with mr grayper mr
grayper go to have a lot of compani
oh if that wa it i wa quit readi to go i wait in the utmost
impati until my mother came home from mr grayper for it wa
that ident neighbour to ascertain if we could get leav to carri
out thi great idea without be nearli so much surpris as i had
expect my mother enter into it readili and it wa all arrang
that night and my board and lodg dure the visit were to be paid
for
the dai soon came for our go it wa such an earli dai that it came
soon even to me who wa in a fever of expect and half afraid
that an earthquak or a fieri mountain or some other great convuls
of natur might interpos to stop the expedit we were to go in a
carrier cart which depart in the morn after breakfast i would
have given ani monei to have been allow to wrap myself up overnight
and sleep in my hat and boot
it touch me nearli now although i tell it lightli to recollect how
eager i wa to leav my happi home to think how littl i suspect what
i did leav for ever
i am glad to recollect that when the carrier cart wa at the gate and
my mother stood there kiss me a grate fond for her and for
the old place i had never turn my back upon befor made me cry i am
glad to know that my mother cri too and that i felt her heart beat
against mine
i am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move my mother
ran out at the gate and call to him to stop that she might kiss me
onc more i am glad to dwell upon the earnest and love with which
she lift up her face to mine and did so
as we left her stand in the road mr murdston came up to where
she wa and seem to expostul with her for be so move i wa
look back round the awn of the cart and wonder what busi
it wa of hi peggotti who wa also look back on the other side
seem anyth but satisfi as the face she brought back in the cart
denot
i sat look at peggotti for some time in a reveri on thi
supposititi case whether if she were emploi to lose me like the
boi in the fairi tale i should be abl to track my wai home again by
the button she would shed
chapter 3 i have a chang
the carrier hors wa the laziest hors in the world i should hope
and shuffl along with hi head down as if he like to keep peopl
wait to whom the packag were direct i fanci inde that he
sometim chuckl audibl over thi reflect but the carrier said
he wa onli troubl with a cough the carrier had a wai of keep hi
head down like hi hors and of droop sleepili forward as he drove
with on of hi arm on each of hi knee i sai drove but it struck
me that the cart would have gone to yarmouth quit as well without him
for the hors did all that and as to convers he had no idea of it
but whistl
peggotti had a basket of refresh on her knee which would have
last us out handsom if we had been go to london by the same
convey we at a good deal and slept a good deal peggotti alwai
went to sleep with her chin upon the handl of the basket her hold of
which never relax and i could not have believ unless i had heard
her do it that on defenceless woman could have snore so much
we made so mani deviat up and down lane and were such a long time
deliv a bedstead at a publichous and call at other place
that i wa quit tire and veri glad when we saw yarmouth it look
rather spongi and soppi i thought as i carri my ey over the great
dull wast that lai across the river and i could not help wonder if
the world were realli as round as my geographi book said how ani
part of it came to be so flat but i reflect that yarmouth might be
situat at on of the pole which would account for it
as we drew a littl nearer and saw the whole adjac prospect ly a
straight low line under the sky i hint to peggotti that a mound or so
might have improv it and also that if the land had been a littl more
separ from the sea and the town and the tide had not been quit
so much mix up like toast and water it would have been nicer but
peggotti said with greater emphasi than usual that we must take
thing as we found them and that for her part she wa proud to call
herself a yarmouth bloater
when we got into the street which wa strang enough to me and smelt
the fish and pitch and oakum and tar and saw the sailor walk
about and the cart jingl up and down over the stone i felt that i
had done so busi a place an injustic and said as much to peggotti who
heard my express of delight with great complac and told me it
wa well known i suppos to those who had the good fortun to be born
bloater that yarmouth wa upon the whole the finest place in the
univers
here my am scream peggotti grow out of knowledg
he wa wait for us in fact at the publichous and ask me how i
found myself like an old acquaint i did not feel at first that
i knew him as well as he knew me becaus he had never come to our hous
sinc the night i wa born and natur he had the advantag of me
but our intimaci wa much advanc by hi take me on hi back to carri
me home he wa now a huge strong fellow of six feet high broad in
proport and roundshould but with a simper boi face and
curli light hair that gave him quit a sheepish look he wa dress in
a canva jacket and a pair of such veri stiff trouser that thei
would have stood quit as well alon without ani leg in them and you
couldnt so properli have said he wore a hat as that he wa cover in
atop like an old build with someth pitchi
ham carri me on hi back and a small box of our under hi arm
and peggotti carri anoth small box of our we turn down lane
bestrewn with bit of chip and littl hillock of sand and went
past gaswork ropewalk boatbuild yard shipwright yard
shipbreak yard caulker yard rigger loft smith forg
and a great litter of such place until we came out upon the dull wast
i had alreadi seen at a distanc when ham said
yon our hous masr davi
i look in all direct as far as i could stare over the wilder
and awai at the sea and awai at the river but no hous could i make
out there wa a black barg or some other kind of superannu boat
not far off high and dry on the ground with an iron funnel stick
out of it for a chimnei and smoke veri cosili but noth els in the
wai of a habit that wa visibl to me
that not it said i that shiplook thing
that it masr davi return ham
if it had been aladdin palac roc egg and all i suppos i could
not have been more charm with the romant idea of live in it there
wa a delight door cut in the side and it wa roof in and there
were littl window in it but the wonder charm of it wa that
it wa a real boat which had no doubt been upon the water hundr of
time and which had never been intend to be live in on dry land
that wa the captiv of it to me if it had ever been meant to be
live in i might have thought it small or inconveni or lone but
never have been design for ani such us it becam a perfect abod
it wa beautifulli clean insid and as tidi as possibl there wa a
tabl and a dutch clock and a chest of drawer and on the chest of
drawer there wa a teatrai with a paint on it of a ladi with a
parasol take a walk with a militarylook child who wa trundl a
hoop the trai wa kept from tumbl down by a bibl and the trai if
it had tumbl down would have smash a quantiti of cup and saucer
and a teapot that were group around the book on the wall there were
some common colour pictur frame and glaze of scriptur subject
such as i have never seen sinc in the hand of pedlar without see
the whole interior of peggotti brother hous again at on view
abraham in red go to sacrific isaac in blue and daniel in yellow
cast into a den of green lion were the most promin of these over
the littl mantelshelf wa a pictur of the sarah jane lugger built
at sunderland with a real littl wooden stern stuck on to it a work of
art combin composit with carpentri which i consid to be on
of the most enviabl possess that the world could afford there
were some hook in the beam of the ceil the us of which i did not
divin then and some locker and box and conveni of that sort
which serv for seat and ek out the chair
all thi i saw in the first glanc after i cross the
thresholdchildlik accord to my theoryand then peggotti open
a littl door and show me my bedroom it wa the completest and most
desir bedroom ever seenin the stern of the vessel with a littl
window where the rudder us to go through a littl lookingglass
just the right height for me nail against the wall and frame with
oystershel a littl bed which there wa just room enough to get
into and a nosegai of seawe in a blue mug on the tabl the wall
were whitewash as white as milk and the patchwork counterpan made my
ey quit ach with it bright on thing i particularli notic
in thi delight hous wa the smell of fish which wa so search
that when i took out my pockethandkerchief to wipe my nose i found it
smelt exactli as if it had wrap up a lobster on my impart thi
discoveri in confid to peggotti she inform me that her brother
dealt in lobster crab and crawfish and i afterward found that a
heap of these creatur in a state of wonder conglomer with on
anoth and never leav off pinch whatev thei laid hold of
were usual to be found in a littl wooden outhous where the pot and
kettl were kept
we were welcom by a veri civil woman in a white apron whom i had seen
curtsei at the door when i wa on ham back about a quarter of a
mile off likewis by a most beauti littl girl or i thought her so
with a necklac of blue bead on who wouldnt let me kiss her when i
offer to but ran awai and hid herself by and by when we had dine
in a sumptuou manner off boil dab melt butter and potato with
a chop for me a hairi man with a veri goodnatur face came home as
he call peggotti lass and gave her a hearti smack on the cheek i
had no doubt from the gener proprieti of her conduct that he wa her
brother and so he turn outb present introduc to me as mr
peggotti the master of the hous

but youll find us readi
i thank him and repli that i wa sure i should be happi in such a
delight place

that cold would never get hi muck off he soon return greatli
improv in appear but so rubicund that i couldnt help
think hi face had thi in common with the lobster crab and
crawfishthat it went into the hot water veri black and came out veri
red
after tea when the door wa shut and all wa made snug the night
be cold and misti now it seem to me the most delici retreat
that the imagin of man could conceiv to hear the wind get
up out at sea to know that the fog wa creep over the desol flat
outsid and to look at the fire and think that there wa no hous near
but thi on and thi on a boat wa like enchant littl emli
had overcom her shyness and wa sit by my side upon the lowest and
least of the locker which wa just larg enough for us two and just
fit into the chimnei corner mr peggotti with the white apron wa
knit on the opposit side of the fire peggotti at her needlework
wa as much at home with st paul and the bit of waxcandl as if

but at thi point peggottyi mean my own peculiar peggottymad such
impress motion to me not to ask ani more question that i could
onli sit and look at all the silent compani until it wa time to go to
bed then in the privaci of my own littl cabin she inform me that
ham and emli were an orphan nephew and niec whom my host had
at differ time adopt in their childhood when thei were left
destitut and that mr gummidg wa the widow of hi partner in
a boat who had di veri poor he wa but a poor man himself said
peggotti but as good as gold and as true as steelthos were her
simil the onli subject she inform me on which he ever show a
violent temper or swore an oath wa thi generos of hi and if it
were ever refer to by ani on of them he struck the tabl a heavi
blow with hi right hand had split it on on such occas and swore
a dread oath that he would be gorm if he didnt cut and run
for good if it wa ever mention again it appear in answer to
my inquiri that nobodi had the least idea of the etymolog of thi
terribl verb passiv to be gorm but that thei all regard it as
constitut a most solemn imprec
i wa veri sensibl of my entertain good and listen to the
women go to bed in anoth littl crib like mine at the opposit
end of the boat and to him and ham hang up two hammock for
themselv on the hook i had notic in the roof in a veri luxuri
state of mind enhanc by my be sleepi as slumber gradual stole
upon me i heard the wind howl out at sea and come on across the
flat so fierc that i had a lazi apprehens of the great deep
rise in the night but i bethought myself that i wa in a boat after
all and that a man like mr peggotti wa not a bad person to have on
board if anyth did happen
noth happen howev wors than morn almost as soon as it
shone upon the oystershel frame of my mirror i wa out of bed and out
with littl emli pick up stone upon the beach
your quit a sailor i suppos i said to emli i dont know that i
suppos anyth of the kind but i felt it an act of gallantri to
sai someth and a shine sail close to us made such a pretti littl
imag of itself at the moment in her bright ey that it came into my
head to sai thi
no repli emli shake her head im afraid of the sea
afraid i said with a becom air of bold and look veri big
at the mighti ocean i ant
ah but it cruel said emli i have seen it veri cruel to some of
our men i have seen it tear a boat as big as our hous all to piec
i hope it wasnt the boat that
that father wa drownd in said emli no not that on i never
see that boat
nor him i ask her
littl emli shook her head not to rememb
here wa a coincid i immedi went into an explan how i had
never seen my own father and how my mother and i had alwai live
by ourselv in the happiest state imagin and live so then and
alwai meant to live so and how my father grave wa in the churchyard
near our hous and shade by a tree beneath the bough of which i had
walk and heard the bird sing mani a pleasant morn but there were
some differ between emli orphanhood and mine it appear she
had lost her mother befor her father and where her father grave wa
no on knew except that it wa somewher in the depth of the sea
besid said emli as she look about for shell and pebbl your
father wa a gentleman and your mother is a ladi and my father wa a
fisherman and my mother wa a fisherman daughter and my uncl dan is
a fisherman
dan is mr peggotti is he said i
uncl danyond answer emli nod at the boathous
ye i mean him he must be veri good i should think
good said emli if i wa ever to be a ladi id give him a skyblu
coat with diamond button nankeen trouser a red velvet waistcoat a
cock hat a larg gold watch a silver pipe and a box of monei
i said i had no doubt that mr peggotti well deserv these treasur
i must acknowledg that i felt it difficult to pictur him quit at hi
eas in the raiment propos for him by hi grate littl niec and
that i wa particularli doubt of the polici of the cock hat but i
kept these sentiment to myself
littl emli had stop and look up at the sky in her enumer
of these articl as if thei were a gloriou vision we went on again
pick up shell and pebbl
you would like to be a ladi i said
emili look at me and laugh and nod ye
i should like it veri much we would all be gentlefolk togeth then
me and uncl and ham and mr gummidg we wouldnt mind then when
there come stormi weathernot for our own sake i mean we would
for the poor fishermen to be sure and wed help em with monei when
thei come to ani hurt thi seem to me to be a veri satisfactori and
therefor not at all improb pictur i express my pleasur in the
contempl of it and littl emli wa embolden to sai shyli
dont you think you ar afraid of the sea now
it wa quiet enough to reassur me but i have no doubt if i had seen a
moder larg wave come tumbl in i should have taken to my heel
with an aw recollect of her drown relat howev i said
no and i ad you dont seem to be either though you sai you
arefor she wa walk much too near the brink of a sort of old
jetti or wooden causewai we had stroll upon and i wa afraid of her
fall over
im not afraid in thi wai said littl emli but i wake when it
blow and trembl to think of uncl dan and ham and believ i hear em
cry out for help that why i should like so much to be a ladi but
im not afraid in thi wai not a bit look here
she start from my side and ran along a jag timber which protrud
from the place we stood upon and overhung the deep water at some
height without the least defenc the incid is so impress on my
remembr that if i were a draughtsman i could draw it form here
i dare sai accur as it wa that dai and littl emli spring
forward to her destruct as it appear to me with a look that i
have never forgotten direct far out to sea
the light bold flutter littl figur turn and came back safe
to me and i soon laugh at my fear and at the cry i had utter
fruitlessli in ani case for there wa no on near but there have been
time sinc in my manhood mani time there have been when i have
thought is it possibl among the possibl of hidden thing that
in the sudden rash of the child and her wild look so far off there
wa ani merci attract of her into danger ani tempt her toward
him permit on the part of her dead father that her life might have
a chanc of end that dai there ha been a time sinc when i have
wonder whether if the life befor her could have been reveal to me
at a glanc and so reveal as that a child could fulli comprehend it
and if her preserv could have depend on a motion of my hand i
ought to have held it up to save her there ha been a time sincei do
not sai it last long but it ha beenwhen i have ask myself the
question would it have been better for littl emli to have had the
water close abov her head that morn in my sight and when i have
answer ye it would have been
thi mai be prematur i have set it down too soon perhap but let it
stand
we stroll a long wai and load ourselv with thing that we thought
curiou and put some strand starfish carefulli back into the wateri
hardli know enough of the race at thi moment to be quit certain
whether thei had reason to feel oblig to us for do so or the
reverseand then made our wai home to mr peggotti dwell we
stop under the lee of the lobsterouthous to exchang an innoc
kiss and went in to breakfast glow with health and pleasur
like two young mavish mr peggotti said i knew thi meant in our
local dialect like two young thrush and receiv it as a compliment
of cours i wa in love with littl emli i am sure i love that
babi quit as truli quit as tenderli with greater puriti and more
disinterested than can enter into the best love of a later time
of life high and ennobl as it is i am sure my fanci rais up
someth round that blueei mite of a child which ether
and made a veri angel of her if ani sunni forenoon she had spread
a littl pair of wing and flown awai befor my ey i dont think i
should have regard it as much more than i had had reason to expect
we us to walk about that dim old flat at yarmouth in a love manner
hour and hour the dai sport by us as if time had not grown up
himself yet but were a child too and alwai at plai i told emli
i ador her and that unless she confess she ador me i should be
reduc to the necess of kill myself with a sword she said she
did and i have no doubt she did
as to ani sens of inequ or youth or other difficulti
in our wai littl emli and i had no such troubl becaus we had no
futur we made no more provis for grow older than we did for
grow younger we were the admir of mr gummidg and peggotti
who us to whisper of an even when we sat lovingli on our littl
locker side by side lor wasnt it beauti mr peggotti smile at
us from behind hi pipe and ham grin all the even and did noth
els thei had someth of the sort of pleasur in us i suppos that
thei might have had in a pretti toi or a pocket model of the colosseum
i soon found out that mr gummidg did not alwai make herself so
agreeabl as she might have been expect to do under the circumst
of her resid with mr peggotti mr gummidg wa rather a fret
disposit and she whimper more sometim than wa comfort for
other parti in so small an establish i wa veri sorri for
her but there were moment when it would have been more agreeabl i
thought if mr gummidg had had a conveni apart of her own to
retir to and had stop there until her spirit reviv
mr peggotti went occasion to a publichous call the will
mind i discov thi by hi be out on the second or third even
of our visit and by mr gummidg look up at the dutch clock
between eight and nine and sai he wa there and that what wa
more she had known in the morn he would go there
mr gummidg had been in a low state all dai and had burst into tear
in the forenoon when the fire smoke i am a lone lorn creetur were
mr gummidg word when that unpleas occurr took place and
everythink goe contrari with me

snuggest in the place as her chair wa certainli the easiest but it
didnt suit her that dai at all she wa constantli complain of the
cold and of it occas a visit in her back which she call
the creep at last she shed tear on that subject and said again
that she wa a lone lorn creetur and everythink went contrari with
her
it is certainli veri cold said peggotti everybodi must feel it so
i feel it more than other peopl said mr gummidg
so at dinner when mr gummidg wa alwai help immedi after me
to whom the prefer wa given as a visitor of distinct the
fish were small and boni and the potato were a littl burnt we all
acknowledg that we felt thi someth of a disappoint but mr
gummidg said she felt it more than we did and shed tear again and
made that former declar with great bitter
accordingli when mr peggotti came home about nine oclock thi
unfortun mr gummidg wa knit in her corner in a veri wretch
and miser condit peggotti had been work cheerfulli ham had
been patch up a great pair of waterboot and i with littl emli
by my side had been read to them mr gummidg had never made ani
other remark than a forlorn sigh and had never rais her ey sinc

gummidg who onli shook her head over her knit

mr gummidg retir with these word and betook herself to bed when
she wa gone mr peggotti who had not exhibit a trace of ani feel
but the profoundest sympathi look round upon us and nod hi head
with a live express of that sentiment still anim hi face
said in a whisper
she been think of the old un
i did not quit understand what old on mr gummidg wa suppos to
have fix her mind upon until peggotti on see me to bed explain
that it wa the late mr gummidg and that her brother alwai took that
for a receiv truth on such occas and that it alwai had a move
effect upon him some time after he wa in hi hammock that night i
heard him myself repeat to ham poor thing she been think of the
old un and whenev mr gummidg wa overcom in a similar manner
dure the remaind of our stai which happen some few time he
alwai said the same thing in extenu of the circumst and
alwai with the tenderest commiser
so the fortnight slip awai vari by noth but the variat of
the tide which alter mr peggotti time of go out and come in
and alter ham engag also when the latter wa unemploi he
sometim walk with us to show us the boat and ship and onc
or twice he took us for a row i dont know why on slight set of
impress should be more particularli associ with a place than
anoth though i believ thi obtain with most peopl in refer
especi to the associ of their childhood i never hear the
name or read the name of yarmouth but i am remind of a certain
sundai morn on the beach the bell ring for church littl emli
lean on my shoulder ham lazili drop stone into the water and
the sun awai at sea just break through the heavi mist and show
us the ship like their own shadow
at last the dai came for go home i bore up against the separ
from mr peggotti and mr gummidg but my agoni of mind at leav
littl emli wa pierc we went arminarm to the publichous where
the carrier put up and i promis on the road to write to her i
redeem that promis afterward in charact larger than those in
which apart ar usual announc in manuscript as be to let
we were greatli overcom at part and if ever in my life i have had
a void made in my heart i had on made that dai
now all the time i had been on my visit i had been ungrat to my
home again and had thought littl or noth about it but i wa no
sooner turn toward it than my reproach young conscienc seem
to point that wai with a readi finger and i felt all the more for the
sink of my spirit that it wa my nest and that my mother wa my
comfort and friend
thi gain upon me as we went along so that the nearer we drew the
more familiar the object becam that we pass the more excit i wa
to get there and to run into her arm but peggotti instead of share
in those transport tri to check them though veri kindli and
look confus and out of sort
blunderston rookeri would come howev in spite of her when the
carrier hors pleasedand did how well i recollect it on a cold
grei afternoon with a dull sky threaten rain
the door open and i look half laugh and half cry in my
pleasant agit for my mother it wa not she but a strang
servant
why peggotti i said ruefulli isnt she come home

anxiou inquiri

howconnect with the grave in the churchyard and the rais of the
dead seem to strike me like an unwholesom wind

peggotti gave a gasp as if she were swallow someth that wa veri
hard and put out her hand said

i dont want to see him and your mama said peggotti
i ceas to draw back and we went straight to the best parlour where
she left me on on side of the fire sat my mother on the other mr

if the room to which my bed wa remov were a sentient thing that could
give evid i might appeal to it at thi daywho sleep there now

i went up there hear the dog in the yard bark after me all the wai
while i climb the stair and look as blank and strang upon the
room as the room look upon me sat down with my small hand cross
and thought
i thought of the oddest thing of the shape of the room of the
crack in the ceil of the paper on the wall of the flaw in
the windowglass make rippl and dimpl on the prospect of the
washingstand be ricketi on it three leg and have a discont
someth about it which remind me of mr gummidg under the
influenc of the old on i wa cry all the time but except that i

dreadfulli in love with littl emli and had been torn awai from her to
come here where no on seem to want me or to care about me half as
much as she did thi made such a veri miser piec of busi of
it that i roll myself up in a corner of the counterpan and cri
myself to sleep

lip which answer her with greater truth davi said my mother

season a word of encourag and explan of piti for my childish
ignor of welcom home of reassur to me that it wa home might
have made me duti to him in my heart henceforth instead of in my

scare and strang and that present when i stole to a chair she
follow me with her ey more sorrowfulli stillmiss perhap some
freedom in my childish treadbut the word wa not spoken and the time
for it wa gone
we dine alon we three togeth he seem to be veri fond of my
motheri am afraid i like him none the better for thatand she wa
veri fond of him i gather from what thei said that an elder sister
of hi wa come to stai with them and that she wa expect that
even i am not certain whether i found out then or afterward that
without be activ concern in ani busi he had some share in
or some annual charg upon the profit of a winemerch hous
in london with which hi famili had been connect from hi
greatgrandfath time and in which hi sister had a similar
interest but i mai mention it in thi place whether or no
after dinner when we were sit by the fire and i wa medit an
escap to peggotti without have the hardihood to slip awai lest
it should offend the master of the hous a coach drove up to the
gardeng and he went out to receiv the visitor my mother follow
him i wa timidli follow her when she turn round at the parlour
door in the dusk and take me in her embrac as she had been us to
do whisper me to love my new father and be obedi to him she did
thi hurriedli and secretli as if it were wrong but tenderli and
put out her hand behind her held mine in it until we came near
to where he wa stand in the garden where she let mine go and drew
her through hi arm
it wa miss murdston who wa arriv and a gloomylook ladi she
wa dark like her brother whom she greatli resembl in face and
voic and with veri heavi eyebrow nearli meet over her larg nose
as if be disabl by the wrong of her sex from wear whisker
she had carri them to that account she brought with her two
uncompromis hard black box with her initi on the lid in hard
brass nail when she paid the coachman she took her monei out of a hard
steel purs and she kept the purs in a veri jail of a bag which hung
upon her arm by a heavi chain and shut up like a bite i had never at
that time seen such a metal ladi altogeth as miss murdston wa
she wa brought into the parlour with mani token of welcom and there
formal recogn my mother as a new and near relat then she
look at me and said
is that your boi sisterinlaw
my mother acknowledg me
gener speak said miss murdston i dont like boi how dye
do boi
under these encourag circumst i repli that i wa veri well
and that i hope she wa the same with such an indiffer grace that
miss murdston dispos of me in two word
want manner
have utter which with great distinct she beg the favour of
be shown to her room which becam to me from that time forth a place
of aw and dread wherein the two black box were never seen open or
known to be left unlock and where for i peep in onc or twice when
she wa out numer littl steel fetter and rivet with which miss
murdston embellish herself when she wa dress gener hung upon
the lookingglass in formid arrai
as well as i could make out she had come for good and had no intent
of ever go again she began to help my mother next morn and wa
in and out of the storecloset all dai put thing to right and
make havoc in the old arrang almost the first remark thing
i observ in miss murdston wa her be constantli haunt by
a suspicion that the servant had a man secret somewher on the
premis under the influenc of thi delus she dive into the
coalcellar at the most untim hour and scarc ever open the
door of a dark cupboard without clap it to again in the belief that
she had got him
though there wa noth veri airi about miss murdston she wa a
perfect lark in point of get up she wa up and as i believ
to thi hour look for that man befor anybodi in the hous wa
stir peggotti gave it as her opinion that she even slept with on
ey open but i could not concur in thi idea for i tri it myself
after hear the suggest thrown out and found it couldnt be done
on the veri first morn after her arriv she wa up and ring her
bell at cockcrow when my mother came down to breakfast and wa go
to make the tea miss murdston gave her a kind of peck on the cheek
which wa her nearest approach to a kiss and said
now clara my dear i am come here you know to reliev you of all
the troubl i can your much too pretti and thoughtlessmi mother
blush but laugh and seem not to dislik thi characterto have
ani duti impos upon you that can be undertaken by me if youll be
so good as give me your kei my dear ill attend to all thi sort of
thing in futur
from that time miss murdston kept the kei in her own littl jail all
dai and under her pillow all night and my mother had no more to do
with them than i had
my mother did not suffer her author to pass from her without a shadow
of protest on night when miss murdston had been develop certain

miss murdston took their stand howev i might have express
my comprehens of it at that time if i had been call upon i
nevertheless did clearli comprehend in my own wai that it wa anoth
name for tyranni and for a certain gloomi arrog devil humour
that wa in them both the creed as i should state it now wa thi
mr murdston wa firm nobodi in hi world wa to be so firm as mr
murdston nobodi els in hi world wa to be firm at all for everybodi
wa to be bent to hi firm miss murdston wa an except

assist in thi endeavour and to assum for my sake a condit
someth like a housekeep and when she meet with a base return

jane murdston said mr murdston to hi sister ani harsh word
between us ar i hope uncommon it is not my fault that so unusu an
occurr ha taken place tonight i wa betrai into it by anoth
nor is it your fault you were betrai into it by anoth let us both
try to forget it and as thi he ad after these magnanim word
is not a fit scene for the boydavid go to bed
i could hardli find the door through the tear that stood in my ey
i wa so sorri for my mother distress but i grope my wai out and
grope my wai up to my room in the dark without even have the heart
to sai good night to peggotti or to get a candl from her when her
come up to look for me an hour or so afterward awok me she said
that my mother had gone to bed poorli and that mr and miss murdston
were sit alon
go down next morn rather earlier than usual i paus outsid the
parlour door on hear my mother voic she wa veri earnestli and
humbl entreat miss murdston pardon which that ladi grant and
a perfect reconcili took place i never knew my mother afterward
to give an opinion on ani matter without first appeal to miss
murdston or without have first ascertain by some sure mean what
miss murdston opinion wa and i never saw miss murdston when out
of temper she wa infirm that wai move her hand toward her bag as
if she were go to take out the kei and offer to resign them to my
mother without see that my mother wa in a terribl fright
the gloomi taint that wa in the murdston blood darken the murdston
religion which wa auster and wrath i have thought sinc
that it assum that charact wa a necessari consequ of mr
murdston firm which wouldnt allow him to let anybodi off from
the utmost weight of the severest penalti he could find ani excus
for be thi as it mai i well rememb the tremend visag with
which we us to go to church and the chang air of the place again
the dread sundai come round and i file into the old pew first like
a guard captiv brought to a condemn servic again miss murdston
in a black velvet gown that look as if it had been made out of a pall
follow close upon me then my mother then her husband there is no
peggotti now as in the old time again i listen to miss murdston
mumbl the respons and emphas all the dread word with a cruel
relish again i see her dark ey roll round the church when she sai
miser sinner as if she were call all the congreg name
again i catch rare glimps of my mother move her lip timidli
between the two with on of them mutter at each ear like low
thunder again i wonder with a sudden fear whether it is like that
our good old clergyman can be wrong and mr and miss murdston right
and that all the angel in heaven can be destroi angel again if i
move a finger or relax a muscl of my face miss murdston poke me with
her prayerbook and make my side ach
ye and again as we walk home i note some neighbour look at my
mother and at me and whisper again as the three go on arminarm
and i linger behind alon i follow some of those look and wonder if
my mother step be realli not so light as i have seen it and if the
gaieti of her beauti be realli almost worri awai again i wonder
whether ani of the neighbour call to mind as i do how we us to
walk home togeth she and i and i wonder stupidli about that all the
dreari dismal dai
there had been some talk on occas of my go to boardingschool

agre with them noth howev wa conclud on the subject yet
in the meantim i learnt lesson at home shall i ever forget those

mr murdston and hi sister who were alwai present and found them
a favour occas for give my mother lesson in that miscal
firm which wa the bane of both our live i believ i wa kept
at home for that purpos i had been apt enough to learn and will
enough when my mother and i had live alon togeth i can faintli
rememb learn the alphabet at her knee to thi dai when i look
upon the fat black letter in the primer the puzzl novelti of their
shape and the easi goodnatur of o and q and s seem to present
themselv again befor me as thei us to do but thei recal no
feel of disgust or reluct on the contrari i seem to have walk
along a path of flower as far as the crocodilebook and to have been
cheer by the gentl of my mother voic and manner all the
wai but these solemn lesson which succeed those i rememb as the
deathblow of my peac and a grievou daili drudgeri and miseri thei
were veri long veri numer veri hardperfectli unintellig
some of them to meand i wa gener as much bewild by them as i
believ my poor mother wa herself
let me rememb how it us to be and bring on morn back again
i come into the secondbest parlour after breakfast with my book
and an exercisebook and a slate my mother is readi for me at her
writingdesk but not half so readi as mr murdston in hi easychair
by the window though he pretend to be read a book or as miss
murdston sit near my mother string steel bead the veri sight
of these two ha such an influenc over me that i begin to feel the
word i have been at infinit pain to get into my head all slide
awai and go i dont know where i wonder where thei do go by the
by
i hand the first book to my mother perhap it is a grammar perhap a
histori or geographi i take a last drown look at the page as i give
it into her hand and start off aloud at a race pace while i have
got it fresh i trip over a word mr murdston look up i trip
over anoth word miss murdston look up i redden tumbl over
halfadozen word and stop i think my mother would show me the book
if she dare but she doe not dare and she sai softli
oh davi davi

davi davi that childish he know hi lesson or he doe not know

i am realli afraid he doe not sai my mother
then you see clara return miss murdston you should just give
him the book back and make him know it
ye certainli sai my mother that is what i intend to do my dear
jane now davi try onc more and dont be stupid
i obei the first claus of the injunct by try onc more but am
not so success with the second for i am veri stupid i tumbl down
befor i get to the old place at a point where i wa all right befor
and stop to think but i cant think about the lesson i think of the
number of yard of net in miss murdston cap or of the price of mr
murdston dressinggown or ani such ridicul problem that i have
no busi with and dont want to have anyth at all to do with mr
murdston make a movement of impati which i have been expect
for a long time miss murdston doe the same my mother glanc
submiss at them shut the book and lai it by as an arrear to be
work out when my other task ar done
there is a pile of these arrear veri soon and it swell like a roll
snowbal the bigger it get the more stupid i get the case is so
hopeless and i feel that i am wallow in such a bog of nonsens that
i give up all idea of get out and abandon myself to my fate the
despair wai in which my mother and i look at each other as i blunder
on is truli melancholi but the greatest effect in these miser
lesson is when my mother think nobodi is observ her tri
to give me the cue by the motion of her lip at that instant miss
murdston who ha been ly in wait for noth els all along sai
in a deep warn voic
clara
my mother start colour and smile faintli mr murdston come out
of hi chair take the book throw it at me or box my ear with it
and turn me out of the room by the shoulder
even when the lesson ar done the worst is yet to happen in the shape
of an appal sum thi is invent for me and deliv to me oral
by mr murdston and begin if i go into a cheesemong shop and
bui five thousand doublegloucest chees at fourpencehalfpenni each
present paymentat which i see miss murdston secretli overjoi
i pore over these chees without ani result or enlighten until
dinnertim when have made a mulatto of myself by get the dirt
of the slate into the pore of my skin i have a slice of bread to help
me out with the chees and am consid in disgrac for the rest of
the even
it seem to me at thi distanc of time as if my unfortun studi
gener took thi cours i could have done veri well if i had been
without the murdston but the influenc of the murdston upon me wa
like the fascin of two snake on a wretch young bird even when
i did get through the morn with toler credit there wa not
much gain but dinner for miss murdston never could endur to see me
untask and if i rashli made ani show of be unemploi call her
brother attent to me by sai clara my dear there noth
like workgiv your boi an exercis which caus me to be clap
down to some new labour there and then as to ani recreat with other
children of my ag i had veri littl of that for the gloomi theologi
of the murdston made all children out to be a swarm of littl viper
though there wa a child onc set in the midst of the discipl and
held that thei contamin on anoth
the natur result of thi treatment continu i suppos for some six
month or more wa to make me sullen dull and dog i wa not
made the less so by my sens of be daili more and more shut out and
alien from my mother i believ i should have been almost stupefi
but for on circumst
it wa thi my father had left a small collect of book in a littl
room upstair to which i had access for it adjoin my own and which
nobodi els in our hous ever troubl from that bless littl room
roderick random peregrin pickl humphrei clinker tom jone the
vicar of wakefield don quixot gil bla and robinson cruso came
out a gloriou host to keep me compani thei kept aliv my fanci and
my hope of someth beyond that place and timethei and the arabian
night and the tale of the geniiand did me no harm for whatev
harm wa in some of them wa not there for me i knew noth of it it
is astonish to me now how i found time in the midst of my pore
and blunder over heavier theme to read those book as i did it
is curiou to me how i could ever have consol myself under my
small troubl which were great troubl to me by imperson my
favourit charact in thema i didand by put mr and miss
murdston into all the bad oneswhich i did too i have been tom jone
a child tom jone a harmless creatur for a week togeth i have
sustain my own idea of roderick random for a month at a stretch i
verili believ i had a greedi relish for a few volum of voyag and
travelsi forget what nowthat were on those shelv and for dai
and dai i can rememb to have gone about my region of our hous
arm with the centrepiec out of an old set of boottreesth perfect
realiz of captain somebodi of the royal british navi in danger of
be beset by savag and resolv to sell hi life at a great price
the captain never lost digniti from have hi ear box with the
latin grammar i did but the captain wa a captain and a hero in
despit of all the grammar of all the languag in the world dead or
aliv
thi wa my onli and my constant comfort when i think of it the
pictur alwai rise in my mind of a summer even the boi at plai
in the churchyard and i sit on my bed read as if for life
everi barn in the neighbourhood everi stone in the church and everi
foot of the churchyard had some associ of it own in my mind
connect with these book and stood for some local made famou in
them i have seen tom pipe go climb up the churchsteepl i have
watch strap with the knapsack on hi back stop to rest himself
upon the wicketg and i know that commodor trunnion held that club
with mr pickl in the parlour of our littl villag alehous
the reader now understand as well as i do what i wa when i came to
that point of my youth histori to which i am now come again
on morn when i went into the parlour with my book i found my
mother look anxiou miss murdston look firm and mr murdston

thi wa a good freshen to my presenc of mind as a begin i felt
the word of my lesson slip off not on by on or line by line
but by the entir page i tri to lai hold of them but thei seem
if i mai so express it to have put skate on and to skim awai from me
with a smooth there wa no check
we began badli and went on wors i had come in with an idea of
distinguish myself rather conceiv that i wa veri well prepar
but it turn out to be quit a mistak book after book wa ad to
the heap of failur miss murdston be firmli watch of us all the
time and when we came at last to the five thousand chees cane he
made it that dai i rememb my mother burst out cry
clara said miss murdston in her warn voic

the worri and torment that david ha occas her todai that would be
stoical clara is greatli strengthen and improv but we can hardli
expect so much from her david you and i will go upstair boi
as he took me out at the door my mother ran toward us miss murdston
said clara ar you a perfect fool and interf i saw my mother
stop her ear then and i heard her cry
he walk me up to my room slowli and gravelyi am certain he had a
delight in that formal parad of execut justiceand when we got

he had my head as in a vice but i twine round him somehow and stop
him for a moment entreat him not to beat me it wa onli a moment
that i stop him for he cut me heavili an instant afterward and in
the same instant i caught the hand with which he held me in my mouth
between my teeth and bit it through it set my teeth on edg to think
of it
he beat me then as if he would have beaten me to death abov all the
nois we made i heard them run up the stair and cry outi
heard my mother cry outand peggotti then he wa gone and the
door wa lock outsid and i wa ly fever and hot and torn and
sore and rage in my puni wai upon the floor
how well i recollect when i becam quiet what an unnatur still
seem to reign through the whole hous how well i rememb when my
smart and passion began to cool how wick i began to feel
i sat listen for a long while but there wa not a sound i crawl
up from the floor and saw my face in the glass so swollen red and
ugli that it almost frighten me my stripe were sore and stiff and
made me cry afresh when i move but thei were noth to the guilt i
felt it lai heavier on my breast than if i had been a most atroci
crimin i dare sai
it had begun to grow dark and i had shut the window i had been ly
for the most part with my head upon the sill by turn cry doze
and look listlessli out when the kei wa turn and miss murdston
came in with some bread and meat and milk these she put down upon the
tabl without a word glare at me the while with exemplari firm
and then retir lock the door after her
long after it wa dark i sat there wonder whether anybodi els would
come when thi appear improb for that night i undress and
went to bed and there i began to wonder fearfulli what would be done
to me whether it wa a crimin act that i had commit whether i
should be taken into custodi and sent to prison whether i wa at all
in danger of be hang
i never shall forget the wake next morn the be cheer and
fresh for the first moment and then the be weigh down by the stale
and dismal oppress of remembr miss murdston reappear befor
i wa out of bed told me in so mani word that i wa free to walk in
the garden for half an hour and no longer and retir leav the door
open that i might avail myself of that permiss
i did so and did so everi morn of my imprison which last five
dai if i could have seen my mother alon i should have gone down on
my knee to her and besought her forgiv but i saw no on miss
murdston except dure the whole timeexcept at even prayer in
the parlour to which i wa escort by miss murdston after everybodi
els wa place where i wa station a young outlaw all alon by
myself near the door and whenc i wa solemnli conduct by my jailer
befor ani on aros from the devot postur i onli observ that
my mother wa as far off from me as she could be and kept her face
anoth wai so that i never saw it and that mr murdston hand wa
bound up in a larg linen wrapper
the length of those five dai i can convei no idea of to ani on thei
occupi the place of year in my remembr the wai in which i listen
to all the incid of the hous that made themselv audibl to me
the ring of bell the open and shut of door the murmur
of voic the footstep on the stair to ani laugh whistl or
sing outsid which seem more dismal than anyth els to me in
my solitud and disgraceth uncertain pace of the hour especi
at night when i would wake think it wa morn and find that the
famili were not yet gone to bed and that all the length of night had
yet to cometh depress dream and nightmar i hadth return of
dai noon afternoon even when the boi plai in the churchyard
and i watch them from a distanc within the room be asham to
show myself at the window lest thei should know i wa a prisonerth
strang sensat of never hear myself speakth fleet interv
of someth like cheer which came with eat and drink
and went awai with itth set in of rain on even with a fresh
smell and it come down faster and faster between me and the church
until it and gather night seem to quench me in gloom and fear and
remorseal thi appear to have gone round and round for year instead
of dai it is so vividli and strongli stamp on my remembr on the
last night of my restraint i wa awaken by hear my own name spoken
in a whisper i start up in bed and put out my arm in the dark

small it look under those circumst
i had now leisur to examin the purs it wa a stiff leather purs
with a snap and had three bright shill in it which peggotti had
evid polish up with whiten for my greater delight but it
most preciou content were two halfcrown fold togeth in a bit
of paper on which wa written in my mother hand for davi with my
love i wa so overcom by thi that i ask the carrier to be so good
as to reach me my pockethandkerchief again but he said he thought i
had better do without it and i thought i realli had so i wipe my ey
on my sleev and stop myself
for good too though in consequ of my previou emot i wa

anoth name first
i explain to the ladi how it wa who than rang a bell and call
out william show the coffeeroom upon which a waiter came run
out of a kitchen on the opposit side of the yard to show it and seem
a good deal surpris when he wa onli to show it to me

have felt much stranger if the map had been real foreign countri and
i cast awai in the middl of them i felt it wa take a liberti to
sit down with my cap in my hand on the corner of the chair nearest the
door and when the waiter laid a cloth on purpos for me and put a set
of castor on it i think i must have turn red all over with modesti
he brought me some chop and veget and took the cover off in
such a bounc manner that i wa afraid i must have given him some
offenc but he greatli reliev my mind by put a chair for me at
the tabl and sai veri affabl now sixfoot come on
i thank him and took my seat at the board but found it extrem
difficult to handl my knife and fork with anyth like dexter
or to avoid splash myself with the gravi while he wa stand
opposit stare so hard and make me blush in the most dread
manner everi time i caught hi ey after watch me into the second
chop he said

uncomfort coincid and inquir how it wa done hi answer wa
not cheer to my spirit for it consist of two dismal word with

on broken wittlesand i sleep on the coalsher the waiter burst into
tear
i wa veri much concern for hi misfortun and felt that ani
recognit short of ninep would be mere brutal and hard of
heart therefor i gave him on of my three bright shill which he
receiv with much humil and vener and spun up with hi thumb
directli afterward to try the good of
it wa a littl disconcert to me to find when i wa be help
up behind the coach that i wa suppos to have eaten all the dinner
without ani assist i discov thi from overhear the ladi in
the bowwindow sai to the guard take care of that child georg or
hell burst and from observ that the womenserv who were about
the place came out to look and giggl at me as a young phenomenon my
unfortun friend the waiter who had quit recov hi spirit did
not appear to be disturb by thi but join in the gener admir
without be at all confus if i had ani doubt of him i suppos
thi half awaken it but i am inclin to believ that with the simpl
confid of a child and the natur relianc of a child upon superior
year qualiti i am veri sorri ani children should prematur chang
for worldli wisdom i had no seriou mistrust of him on the whole even
then
i felt it rather hard i must own to be made without deserv it the
subject of joke between the coachman and guard as to the coach draw
heavi behind on account of my sit there and as to the greater
expedi of my travel by waggon the stori of my suppos appetit
get wind among the outsid passeng thei were merri upon it
likewis and ask me whether i wa go to be paid for at school
as two brother or three and whether i wa contract for or went upon
the regular term with other pleasant question but the worst of
it wa that i knew i should be asham to eat anyth when an
opportun offer and that after a rather light dinner i should
remain hungri all nightfor i had left my cake behind at the hotel
in my hurri my apprehens were realiz when we stop for supper
i couldnt muster courag to take ani though i should have like it
veri much but sat by the fire and said i didnt want anyth thi did
not save me from more joke either for a huskyvo gentleman with
a rough face who had been eat out of a sandwichbox nearli all the
wai except when he had been drink out of a bottl said i wa like
a boaconstrictor who took enough at on meal to last him a long time
after which he actual brought a rash out upon himself with boil
beef
we had start from yarmouth at three oclock in the afternoon and we
were due in london about eight next morn it wa midsumm weather
and the even wa veri pleasant when we pass through a villag i
pictur to myself what the insid of the hous were like and what
the inhabit were about and when boi came run after us and
got up behind and swung there for a littl wai i wonder whether their
father were aliv and whether thei were happi at home i had plenti to
think of therefor besid my mind run continu on the kind
of place i wa go towhich wa an aw specul sometim i
rememb i resign myself to thought of home and peggotti and to
endeavour in a confus blind wai to recal how i had felt and
what sort of boi i us to be befor i bit mr murdston which i
couldnt satisfi myself about by ani mean i seem to have bitten him
in such a remot antiqu
the night wa not so pleasant as the even for it got chilli and
be put between two gentlemen the roughfac on and anoth to
prevent my tumbl off the coach i wa nearli smother by their
fall asleep and complet block me up thei squeez me so hard
sometim that i could not help cry out oh if you pleasewhich
thei didnt like at all becaus it woke them opposit me wa an
elderli ladi in a great fur cloak who look in the dark more like a
haystack than a ladi she wa wrap up to such a degre thi ladi had
a basket with her and she hadnt known what to do with it for a long
time until she found that on account of my leg be short it could
go underneath me it cramp and hurt me so that it made me perfectli
miser but if i move in the least and made a glass that wa in the
basket rattl against someth els as it wa sure to do she gave
me the cruellest poke with her foot and said come dont you fidget
your bone ar young enough im sure
at last the sun rose and then my companion seem to sleep easier
the difficulti under which thei had labour all night and which had
found utter in the most terrif gasp and snort ar not to be
conceiv as the sun got higher their sleep becam lighter and so
thei gradual on by on awok i recollect be veri much surpris
by the feint everybodi made then of not have been to sleep at all
and by the uncommon indign with which everyon repel the
charg i labour under the same kind of astonish to thi dai have
invari observ that of all human weak the on to which our
common natur is the least dispos to confess i cannot imagin why is
the weak of have gone to sleep in a coach
what an amaz place london wa to me when i saw it in the distanc
and how i believ all the adventur of all my favourit hero to be
constantli enact and reenact there and how i vagu made it
out in my own mind to be fuller of wonder and wicked than all the
citi of the earth i need not stop here to relat we approach it by
degre and got in due time to the inn in the whitechapel district
for which we were bound i forget whether it wa the blue bull or the
blue boar but i know it wa the blue someth and that it like
wa paint up on the back of the coach
the guard ey light on me as he wa get down and he said at the
bookingoffic door
is there anybodi here for a yoongster book in the name of murdston
from bloonderston sooffolk to be left till call for
nobodi answer
try copperfield if you pleas sir said i look helplessli down
is there anybodi here for a yoongster book in the name of murdston
from bloonderston sooffolk but own to the name of copperfield to
be left till call for said the guard come is there anybodi
no there wa nobodi i look anxious around but the inquiri made no
impress on ani of the bystand if i except a man in gaiter with
on ey who suggest that thei had better put a brass collar round my
neck and tie me up in the stabl
a ladder wa brought and i got down after the ladi who wa like a
haystack not dare to stir until her basket wa remov the coach
wa clear of passeng by that time the luggag wa veri soon clear
out the hors had been taken out befor the luggag and now the coach
itself wa wheel and back off by some hostler out of the wai
still nobodi appear to claim the dusti youngster from blunderston
suffolk
more solitari than robinson cruso who had nobodi to look at him
and see that he wa solitari i went into the bookingoffic and by
invit of the clerk on duti pass behind the counter and sat down
on the scale at which thei weigh the luggag here as i sat look
at the parcel packag and book and inhal the smell of stabl
ever sinc associ with that morn a process of most
tremend consider began to march through my mind suppos
nobodi should ever fetch me how long would thei consent to keep me
there would thei keep me long enough to spend seven shill should i
sleep at night in on of those wooden bin with the other luggag
and wash myself at the pump in the yard in the morn or should i
be turn out everi night and expect to come again to be left till
call for when the offic open next dai suppos there wa no
mistak in the case and mr murdston had devis thi plan to get rid
of me what should i do if thei allow me to remain there until my
seven shill were spent i couldnt hope to remain there when i began
to starv that would obvious be inconveni and unpleas to the
custom besid entail on the blue whateveritwa the risk of
funer expens if i start off at onc and tri to walk back home
how could i ever find my wai how could i ever hope to walk so far how
could i make sure of anyon but peggotti even if i got back if i
found out the nearest proper author and offer myself to go for a
soldier or a sailor i wa such a littl fellow that it wa most like
thei wouldnt take me in these thought and a hundr other such
thought turn me burn hot and made me giddi with apprehens and
dismai i wa in the height of my fever when a man enter and whisper
to the clerk who present slant me off the scale and push me over
to him as if i were weigh bought deliv and paid for
as i went out of the offic hand in hand with thi new acquaint
i stole a look at him he wa a gaunt sallow young man with hollow
cheek and a chin almost as black as mr murdston but there the
like end for hi whisker were shave off and hi hair instead
of be glossi wa rusti and dry he wa dress in a suit of black
cloth which were rather rusti and dry too and rather short in the
sleev and leg and he had a white neckkerchief on that wa not
overclean i did not and do not suppos that thi neckkerchief wa
all the linen he wore but it wa all he show or gave ani hint of
your the new boi he said ye sir i said
i suppos i wa i didnt know
im on of the master at salem hous he said
i made him a bow and felt veri much overaw i wa so asham to allud
to a commonplac thing like my box to a scholar and a master at salem
hous that we had gone some littl distanc from the yard befor i had
the hardihood to mention it we turn back on my humbl insinu
that it might be us to me hereaft and he told the clerk that the
carrier had instruct to call for it at noon
if you pleas sir i said when we had accomplish about the same
distanc as befor is it far
it down by blackheath he said
is that far sir i diffid ask
it a good step he said we shall go by the stagecoach it about
six mile
i wa so faint and tire that the idea of hold out for six mile
more wa too much for me i took heart to tell him that i had had
noth all night and that if he would allow me to bui someth to
eat i should be veri much oblig to him he appear surpris at
thisi see him stop and look at me nowand after consid for a few
moment said he want to call on an old person who live not far off
and that the best wai would be for me to bui some bread or whatev i
like best that wa wholesom and make my breakfast at her hous where
we could get some milk
accordingli we look in at a baker window and after i had made a
seri of propos to bui everyth that wa biliou in the shop and
he had reject them on by on we decid in favour of a nice littl
loaf of brown bread which cost me threepenc then at a grocer shop
we bought an egg and a slice of streaki bacon which still left what
i thought a good deal of chang out of the second of the bright
shill and made me consid london a veri cheap place these
provis laid in we went on through a great nois and uproar that
confus my weari head beyond descript and over a bridg which no
doubt wa london bridg inde i think he told me so but i wa half
asleep until we came to the poor person hous which wa a part of
some almshous as i knew by their look and by an inscript on a
stone over the gate which said thei were establish for twentyf
poor women
the master at salem hous lift the latch of on of a number of littl
black door that were all alik and had each a littl diamondpan
window on on side and anoth littl diamondpan window abov and
we went into the littl hous of on of these poor old women who wa
blow a fire to make a littl saucepan boil on see the master
enter the old woman stop with the bellow on her knee and said
someth that i thought sound like my charlei but on see me
come in too she got up and rub her hand made a confus sort of
half curtsei
can you cook thi young gentleman breakfast for him if you pleas
said the master at salem hous
can i said the old woman ye can i sure
how mr fibbitson todai said the master look at anoth old
woman in a larg chair by the fire who wa such a bundl of cloth
that i feel grate to thi hour for not have sat upon her by
mistak
ah she poorli said the first old woman it on of her bad dai
if the fire wa to go out through ani accid i verili believ shed
go out too and never come to life again
as thei look at her i look at her also although it wa a warm dai
she seem to think of noth but the fire i fanci she wa jealou
even of the saucepan on it and i have reason to know that she took it
impress into the servic of boil my egg and broil my bacon in
dudgeon for i saw her with my own discomfit ey shake her fist at
me onc when those culinari oper were go on and no on els
wa look the sun stream in at the littl window but she sat with
her own back and the back of the larg chair toward it screen the
fire as if she were sedul keep it warm instead of it keep
her warm and watch it in a most distrust manner the complet
of the prepar for my breakfast by reliev the fire gave her
such extrem joi that she laugh aloudand a veri unmelodi laugh
she had i must sai
i sat down to my brown loaf my egg and my rasher of bacon with a
basin of milk besid and made a most delici meal while i wa yet
in the full enjoy of it the old woman of the hous said to the
master

the master upon thi put hi hand underneath the skirt of hi coat
and brought out hi flute in three piec which he screw togeth
and began immedi to plai my impress is after mani year of
consider that there never can have been anybodi in the world who
plai wors he made the most dismal sound i have ever heard produc
by ani mean natur or artifici i dont know what the tune
wereif there were such thing in the perform at all which i
doubtbut the influenc of the strain upon me wa first to make me
think of all my sorrow until i could hardli keep my tear back then to
take awai my appetit and lastli to make me so sleepi that i couldnt
keep my ey open thei begin to close again and i begin to nod as the
recollect rise fresh upon me onc more the littl room with it
open corner cupboard and it squareback chair and it angular
littl staircas lead to the room abov and it three peacock
feather displai over the mantelpiecei rememb wonder when i
first went in what that peacock would have thought if he had known what
hi fineri wa doom to come tofad from befor me and i nod and
sleep the flute becom inaud the wheel of the coach ar heard
instead and i am on my journei the coach jolt i wake with a start
and the flute ha come back again and the master at salem hous is
sit with hi leg cross plai it dolefulli while the old woman
of the hous look on delight she fade in her turn and he fade
and all fade and there is no flute no master no salem hous no
david copperfield no anyth but heavi sleep
i dream i thought that onc while he wa blow into thi dismal
flute the old woman of the hous who had gone nearer and nearer to him
in her ecstat admir lean over the back of hi chair and gave
him an affection squeez round the neck which stop hi plai
for a moment i wa in the middl state between sleep and wake
either then or immedi afterward for as he resumedit wa a real
fact that he had stop playingi saw and heard the same old woman ask
mr fibbitson if it wasnt delici mean the flute to which mr
fibbitson repli ay ay ye and nod at the fire to which i am
persuad she gave the credit of the whole perform
when i seem to have been doze a long while the master at salem
hous unscrew hi flute into the three piec put them up as befor
and took me awai we found the coach veri near at hand and got upon the
roof but i wa so dead sleepi that when we stop on the road to take
up somebodi els thei put me insid where there were no passeng and
where i slept profoundli until i found the coach go at a footpac up
a steep hill among green leav present it stop and had come to
it destin
a short walk brought usi mean the master and meto salem hous which
wa enclos with a high brick wall and look veri dull over a door
in thi wall wa a board with salem hous upon it and through a grate
in thi door we were survei when we rang the bell by a surli face
which i found on the door be open belong to a stout man with a
bullneck a wooden leg overhang templ and hi hair cut close all
round hi head
the new boi said the master
the man with the wooden leg ei me all overit didnt take long for
there wa not much of meand lock the gate behind us and took out
the kei we were go up to the hous among some dark heavi tree
when he call after my conductor hallo
we look back and he wa stand at the door of a littl lodg where
he live with a pair of boot in hi hand
here the cobbler been he said sinc youv been out mr mell
and he sai he cant mend em ani more he sai there aint a bit of the
origin boot left and he wonder you expect it
with these word he threw the boot toward mr mell who went back a
few pace to pick them up and look at them veri disconsol
i wa afraid as we went on togeth i observ then for the first
time that the boot he had on were a good deal the wors for wear and
that hi stock wa just break out in on place like a bud
salem hous wa a squar brick build with wing of a bare and
unfurnish appear all about it wa so veri quiet that i said to
mr mell i suppos the boi were out but he seem surpris at my
not know that it wa holidaytim that all the boi were at their
sever home that mr creakl the proprietor wa down by the
seasid with mr and miss creakl and that i wa sent in holidaytim
as a punish for my misdo all of which he explain to me as we
went along
i gaze upon the schoolroom into which he took me as the most forlorn
and desol place i had ever seen i see it now a long room with three
long row of desk and six of form and bristl all round with peg
for hat and slate scrap of old copybook and exercis litter the
dirti floor some silkworm hous made of the same materi ar
scatter over the desk two miser littl white mice left behind
by their owner ar run up and down in a fusti castl made of
pasteboard and wire look in all the corner with their red ey
for anyth to eat a bird in a cage veri littl bigger than himself
make a mourn rattl now and then in hop on hi perch two inch
high or drop from it but neither sing nor chirp there is a
strang unwholesom smell upon the room like mildew corduroi sweet
appl want air and rotten book there could not well be more ink
splash about it if it had been roofless from it first construct
and the ski had rain snow hail and blown ink through the
vari season of the year
mr mell have left me while he took hi irrepar boot upstair i
went softli to the upper end of the room observ all thi as i crept
along suddenli i came upon a pasteboard placard beautifulli written
which wa ly on the desk and bore these word take care of him he
bite
i got upon the desk immedi apprehens of at least a great dog
underneath but though i look all round with anxiou ey i could
see noth of him i wa still engag in peer about when mr mell
came back and ask me what i did up there
i beg your pardon sir sai i if you pleas im look for the
dog
dog he sai what dog
isnt it a dog sir
isnt what a dog
that to be taken care of sir that bite
no copperfield sai he grave that not a dog that a boi
my instruct ar copperfield to put thi placard on your back i am
sorri to make such a begin with you but i must do it with that he
took me down and ti the placard which wa neatli construct for
the purpos on my shoulder like a knapsack and wherev i went
afterward i had the consol of carri it
what i suffer from that placard nobodi can imagin whether it wa
possibl for peopl to see me or not i alwai fanci that somebodi wa
read it it wa no relief to turn round and find nobodi for wherev
my back wa there i imagin somebodi alwai to be that cruel man with
the wooden leg aggrav my suffer he wa in author and if he
ever saw me lean against a tree or a wall or the hous he roar
out from hi lodg door in a stupend voic hallo you sir you
copperfield show that badg conspicu or ill report you the
playground wa a bare gravel yard open to all the back of the hous
and the offic and i knew that the servant read it and the butcher
read it and the baker read it that everybodi in a word who came
backward and forward to the hous of a morn when i wa order to
walk there read that i wa to be taken care of for i bit i recollect
that i posit began to have a dread of myself as a kind of wild boi
who did bite
there wa an old door in thi playground on which the boi had a
custom of carv their name it wa complet cover with such
inscript in my dread of the end of the vacat and their come
back i could not read a boi name without inquir in what tone and
with what emphasi he would read take care of him he bite there
wa on boya certain j steerforthwho cut hi name veri deep and
veri often who i conceiv would read it in a rather strong voic
and afterward pull my hair there wa anoth boi on tommi traddl
who i dread would make game of it and pretend to be dreadfulli
frighten of me there wa a third georg dempl who i fanci would
sing it i have look a littl shrink creatur at that door until
the owner of all the namesther were fiveandforti of them in the
school then mr mell saidseem to send me to coventri by gener
acclam and to cry out each in hi own wai take care of him he
bite
it wa the same with the place at the desk and form it wa the same
with the grove of desert bedstead i peep at on my wai to and
when i wa in my own bed i rememb dream night after night of
be with my mother as she us to be or of go to a parti at mr
peggotti or of travel outsid the stagecoach or of dine again
with my unfortun friend the waiter and in all these circumst
make peopl scream and stare by the unhappi disclosur that i had
noth on but my littl nightshirt and that placard
in the monotoni of my life and in my constant apprehens of the
reopen of the school it wa such an insupport afflict i had
long task everi dai to do with mr mell but i did them there be
no mr and miss murdston here and got through them without disgrac
befor and after them i walk aboutsupervis as i have mention
by the man with the wooden leg how vividli i call to mind the damp
about the hous the green crack flagston in the court an old leaki
waterbutt and the discolour trunk of some of the grim tree which
seem to have drip more in the rain than other tree and to have
blown less in the sun at on we dine mr mell and i at the upper end
of a long bare diningroom full of deal tabl and smell of fat
then we had more task until tea which mr mell drank out of a blue
teacup and i out of a tin pot all dai long and until seven or eight
in the even mr mell at hi own detach desk in the schoolroom
work hard with pen ink ruler book and writingpap make out
the bill as i found for last halfyear when he had put up hi thing
for the night he took out hi flute and blew at it until i almost
thought he would gradual blow hi whole be into the larg hole at
the top and ooz awai at the kei
i pictur my small self in the dimlylight room sit with my
head upon my hand listen to the dole perform of mr mell
and con tomorrow lesson i pictur myself with my book shut up
still listen to the dole perform of mr mell and listen
through it to what us to be at home and to the blow of the wind
on yarmouth flat and feel veri sad and solitari i pictur myself
go up to bed among the unus room and sit on my bedsid
cry for a comfort word from peggotti i pictur myself come
downstair in the morn and look through a long ghastli gash of a
staircas window at the schoolbel hang on the top of an outhous
with a weathercock abov it and dread the time when it shall ring j
steerforth and the rest to work which is onli second in my forebod
apprehens to the time when the man with the wooden leg shall unlock
the rusti gate to give admiss to the aw mr creakl i cannot
think i wa a veri danger charact in ani of these aspect but in
all of them i carri the same warn on my back
mr mell never said much to me but he wa never harsh to me i suppos
we were compani to each other without talk i forgot to mention that
he would talk to himself sometim and grin and clench hi fist and
grind hi teeth and pull hi hair in an unaccount manner but he
had these peculiar and at first thei frighten me though i soon
got us to them
chapter 6 i enlarg my circl of acquaint
i had led thi life about a month when the man with the wooden leg
began to stump about with a mop and a bucket of water from which i
infer that prepar were make to receiv mr creakl and the
boi i wa not mistaken for the mop came into the schoolroom befor
long and turn out mr mell and me who live where we could and got
on how we could for some dai dure which we were alwai in the wai
of two or three young women who had rare shown themselv befor and
were so continu in the midst of dust that i sneez almost as much
as if salem hous had been a great snuffbox
on dai i wa inform by mr mell that mr creakl would be home that
even in the even after tea i heard that he wa come befor
bedtim i wa fetch by the man with the wooden leg to appear befor
him
mr creakl part of the hous wa a good deal more comfort than
our and he had a snug bit of garden that look pleasant after the
dusti playground which wa such a desert in miniatur that i thought
no on but a camel or a dromedari could have felt at home in it it
seem to me a bold thing even to take notic that the passag look
comfort as i went on my wai trembl to mr creakl presenc
which so abash me when i wa usher into it that i hardli saw
mr creakl or miss creakl who were both there in the parlour or

head he had thick vein in hi forehead a littl nose and a larg
chin he wa bald on the top of hi head and had some thin wetlook
hair that wa just turn grei brush across each templ so that
the two side interlac on hi forehead but the circumst about
him which impress me most wa that he had no voic but spoke in a
whisper the exert thi cost him or the conscious of talk in
that feebl wai made hi angri face so much more angri and hi thick
vein so much thicker when he spoke that i am not surpris on

hi own properti as to me i sat on hi left hand and the rest were
group about us on the nearest bed and on the floor
how well i recollect our sit there talk in whisper or their
talk and my respectfulli listen i ought rather to sai the
moonlight fall a littl wai into the room through the window
paint a pale window on the floor and the greater part of us in
shadow except when steerforth dip a match into a phosphorusbox
when he want to look for anyth on the board and shed a blue glare
over us that wa gone directli a certain mysteri feel consequ
on the dark the secreci of the revel and the whisper in which
everyth wa said steal over me again and i listen to all thei tell
me with a vagu feel of solemn and aw which make me glad that
thei ar all so near and frighten me though i feign to laugh when
traddl pretend to see a ghost in the corner
i heard all kind of thing about the school and all belong to it
i heard that mr creakl had not prefer hi claim to be a tartar
without reason that he wa the sternest and most sever of master
that he laid about him right and left everi dai of hi life charg
in among the boi like a trooper and slash awai unmercifulli that
he knew noth himself but the art of slash be more ignor
j steerforth said than the lowest boi in the school that he had
been a good mani year ago a small hopdeal in the borough and had
taken to the school busi after be bankrupt in hop and make
awai with mr creakl monei with a good deal more of that sort
which i wonder how thei knew
i heard that the man with the wooden leg whose name wa tungai wa an
obstin barbarian who had formerli assist in the hop busi but
had come into the scholast line with mr creakl in consequ
as wa suppos among the boi of hi have broken hi leg in mr
creakl servic and have done a deal of dishonest work for him
and know hi secret i heard that with the singl except of mr
creakl tungai consid the whole establish master and boi
as hi natur enemi and that the onli delight of hi life wa to be
sour and malici i heard that mr creakl had a son who had not been
tungai friend and who assist in the school had onc held some
remonstr with hi father on an occas when it disciplin wa veri
cruelli exercis and wa suppos besid to have protest against
hi father usag of hi mother i heard that mr creakl had turn
him out of door in consequ and that mr and miss creakl had
been in a sad wai ever sinc
but the greatest wonder that i heard of mr creakl wa there be on
boi in the school on whom he never ventur to lai a hand and that
boi be j steerforth steerforth himself confirm thi when it wa
state and said that he should like to begin to see him do it on be
ask by a mild boi not me how he would proce if he did begin to see
him do it he dip a match into hi phosphorusbox on purpos to shed
a glare over hi repli and said he would commenc by knock him down
with a blow on the forehead from the sevenandsixpenni inkbottl
that wa alwai on the mantelpiec we sat in the dark for some time
breathless
i heard that mr sharp and mr mell were both suppos to be wretchedli
paid and that when there wa hot and cold meat for dinner at mr

which wa again corrobor by j steerforth the onli parlourboard
i heard that mr sharp wig didnt fit him and that he neednt be so
bounceablesomebodi els said bumptiousabout it becaus hi own
red hair wa veri plainli to be seen behind
i heard that on boi who wa a coalmerch son came as a setoff
against the coalbil and wa call on that account exchang or
bartera name select from the arithmet book as express thi
arrang i heard that the tabl beer wa a robberi of parent and
the pud an imposit i heard that miss creakl wa regard by the
school in gener as be in love with steerforth and i am sure as i
sat in the dark think of hi nice voic and hi fine face and hi
easi manner and hi curl hair i thought it veri like i heard
that mr mell wa not a bad sort of fellow but hadnt a sixpenc to
bless himself with and that there wa no doubt that old mr mell hi
mother wa as poor as job i thought of my breakfast then and what had
sound like my charlei but i wa i am glad to rememb as mute as
a mous about it
the hear of all thi and a good deal more outlast the banquet

eat and drink were over and we who had remain whisper and
listen halfundress at last betook ourselv to bed too

wa a person of great power in my ey that wa of cours the reason
of my mind run on him no veil futur dimli glanc upon him in
the moonbeam there wa no shadowi pictur of hi footstep in the
garden that i dream of walk in all night
chapter 7 my first half at salem hous
school began in earnest next dai a profound impress wa made
upon me i rememb by the roar of voic in the schoolroom suddenli
becom hush as death when mr creakl enter after breakfast and
stood in the doorwai look round upon us like a giant in a storybook
survei hi captiv
tungai stood at mr creakl elbow he had no occas i thought
to cry out silenc so feroci for the boi were all struck
speechless and motionless
mr creakl wa seen to speak and tungai wa heard to thi effect
now boi thi is a new half take care what your about in thi new
half come fresh up to the lesson i advis you for i come fresh up
to the punish i wont flinch it will be of no us your rub
yourselv you wont rub the mark out that i shall give you now get
to work everi boi
when thi dread exordium wa over and tungai had stump out again
mr creakl came to where i sat and told me that if i were famou for
bite he wa famou for bite too he then show me the cane and
ask me what i thought of that for a tooth wa it a sharp tooth hei
wa it a doubl tooth hei had it a deep prong hei did it bite hei
did it bite at everi question he gave me a fleshi cut with it that made
me writh so i wa veri soon made free of salem hous as steerforth
said and wa veri soon in tear also
not that i mean to sai these were special mark of distinct
which onli i receiv on the contrari a larg major of the boi
especi the smaller on were visit with similar instanc
of notic as mr creakl made the round of the schoolroom half the
establish wa writh and cry befor the dai work began and
how much of it had writh and cri befor the dai work wa over i
am realli afraid to recollect lest i should seem to exagger
i should think there never can have been a man who enjoi hi
profess more than mr creakl did he had a delight in cut at
the boi which wa like the satisfact of a crave appetit i am
confid that he couldnt resist a chubbi boi especi that there
wa a fascin in such a subject which made him restless in hi
mind until he had score and mark him for the dai i wa chubbi
myself and ought to know i am sure when i think of the fellow now my
blood rise against him with the disinterest indign i should
feel if i could have known all about him without have ever been in hi
power but it rise hotli becaus i know him to have been an incap
brute who had no more right to be possess of the great trust he held
than to be lord high admir or commanderinchiefin either of
which capac it is probabl that he would have done infinit less
mischief
miser littl propiti of a remorseless idol how abject we were
to him what a launch in life i think it now on look back to be so
mean and servil to a man of such part and pretens
here i sit at the desk again watch hi eyehumbl watch hi ey
as he rule a cipheringbook for anoth victim whose hand have just
been flatten by that ident ruler and who is try to wipe the
sting out with a pockethandkerchief i have plenti to do i dont watch
hi ey in idl but becaus i am morbidli attract to it in a
dread desir to know what he will do next and whether it will be my
turn to suffer or somebodi els a lane of small boi beyond me with
the same interest in hi ey watch it too i think he know it
though he pretend he dont he make dread mouth as he rule the
cipheringbook and now he throw hi ey sidewai down our lane and we
all droop over our book and trembl a moment afterward we ar again
ey him an unhappi culprit found guilti of imperfect exercis
approach at hi command the culprit falter excus and profess a
determin to do better tomorrow mr creakl cut a joke befor he
beat him and we laugh at itmiser littl dog we laugh with
our visag as white as ash and our heart sink into our boot
here i sit at the desk again on a drowsi summer afternoon a buzz and
hum go up around me as if the boi were so mani bluebottl a cloggi
sensat of the lukewarm fat of meat is upon me we dine an hour or
two ago and my head is as heavi as so much lead i would give the
world to go to sleep i sit with my ey on mr creakl blink at him
like a young owl when sleep overpow me for a minut he still loom
through my slumber rule those cipheringbook until he softli come
behind me and wake me to plainer percept of him with a red ridg
across my back
here i am in the playground with my ey still fascin by him though
i cant see him the window at a littl distanc from which i know he is
have hi dinner stand for him and i ey that instead if he show
hi face near it mine assum an implor and submiss express
if he look out through the glass the boldest boi steerforth except
stop in the middl of a shout or yell and becom contempl on
dai traddl the most unfortun boi in the world break that window
accident with a ball i shudder at thi moment with the tremend
sensat of see it done and feel that the ball ha bound on to
mr creakl sacr head
poor traddl in a tight skyblu suit that made hi arm and leg like
german sausag or rolypoli pud he wa the merriest and most
miser of all the boi he wa alwai be canedi think he wa
cane everi dai that halfyear except on holidai mondai when he wa
onli rulerd on both handsand wa alwai go to write to hi uncl
about it and never did after lai hi head on the desk for a littl
while he would cheer up somehow begin to laugh again and draw
skeleton all over hi slate befor hi ey were dry i us at first
to wonder what comfort traddl found in draw skeleton and for some
time look upon him as a sort of hermit who remind himself by those
symbol of mortal that cane couldnt last for ever but i believ
he onli did it becaus thei were easi and didnt want ani featur
he wa veri honour traddl wa and held it as a solemn duti
in the boi to stand by on anoth he suffer for thi on sever
occas and particularli onc when steerforth laugh in church
and the beadl thought it wa traddl and took him out i see him now
go awai in custodi despis by the congreg he never said
who wa the real offend though he smart for it next dai and wa
imprison so mani hour that he came forth with a whole churchyardful
of skeleton swarm all over hi latin dictionari but he had hi
reward steerforth said there wa noth of the sneak in traddl and
we all felt that to be the highest prais for my part i could have
gone through a good deal though i wa much less brave than traddl
and noth like so old to have won such a recompens
to see steerforth walk to church befor us arminarm with miss
creakl wa on of the great sight of my life i didnt think miss
creakl equal to littl emli in point of beauti and i didnt love
her i didnt dare but i thought her a young ladi of extraordinari
attract and in point of gentil not to be surpass when
steerforth in white trouser carri her parasol for her i felt proud
to know him and believ that she could not choos but ador him with
all her heart mr sharp and mr mell were both notabl personag in my
ey but steerforth wa to them what the sun wa to two star
steerforth continu hi protect of me and prove a veri us
friend sinc nobodi dare to annoi on whom he honour with hi
counten he couldntor at all event he didntdefend me from mr
creakl who wa veri sever with me but whenev i had been treat
wors than usual he alwai told me that i want a littl of hi pluck
and that he wouldnt have stood it himself which i felt he intend
for encourag and consid to be veri kind of him there wa on
advantag and onli on that i know of in mr creakl sever he
found my placard in hi wai when he came up or down behind the form on
which i sat and want to make a cut at me in pass for thi reason
it wa soon taken off and i saw it no more
an accident circumst cement the intimaci between steerforth
and me in a manner that inspir me with great pride and satisfact
though it sometim led to inconveni it happen on on occas
when he wa do me the honour of talk to me in the playground that
i hazard the observ that someth or somebodyi forget what
nowwa like someth or somebodi in peregrin pickl he said noth
at the time but when i wa go to bed at night ask me if i had got
that book
i told him no and explain how it wa that i had read it and all
those other book of which i have made mention
and do you recollect them steerforth said
oh ye i repli i had a good memori and i believ i recollect
them veri well
then i tell you what young copperfield said steerforth you
shall tell em to me i cant get to sleep veri earli at night and i
gener wake rather earli in the morn well go over em on after
anoth well make some regular arabian night of it
i felt extrem flatter by thi arrang and we commenc
carri it into execut that veri even what ravag i commit
on my favourit author in the cours of my interpret of them i am
not in a condit to sai and should be veri unwil to know but
i had a profound faith in them and i had to the best of my belief
a simpl earnest manner of narrat what i did narrat and these
qualiti went a long wai
the drawback wa that i wa often sleepi at night or out of spirit
and indispos to resum the stori and then it wa rather hard work
and it must be done for to disappoint or to displeas steerforth wa of
cours out of the question in the morn too when i felt weari and
should have enjoi anoth hour repos veri much it wa a tiresom
thing to be rous like the sultana scheherazad and forc into a
long stori befor the gettingup bell rang but steerforth wa resolut
and as he explain to me in return my sum and exercis and
anyth in my task that wa too hard for me i wa no loser by the
transact let me do myself justic howev i wa move by no
interest or selfish motiv nor wa i move by fear of him i admir
and love him and hi approv wa return enough it wa so preciou to
me that i look back on these trifl now with an ach heart
steerforth wa consider too and show hi consider in
on particular instanc in an unflinch manner that wa a littl
tantal i suspect to poor traddl and the rest peggotti
promis letterwhat a comfort letter it wasarriv befor
the half wa mani week old and with it a cake in a perfect nest
of orang and two bottl of cowslip wine thi treasur as in duti
bound i laid at the feet of steerforth and beg him to dispens
now ill tell you what young copperfield said he the wine shall
be kept to wet your whistl when you ar storytel
i blush at the idea and beg him in my modesti not to think of
it but he said he had observ i wa sometim hoarsea littl roopi
wa hi exact expressionand it should be everi drop devot to the
purpos he had mention accordingli it wa lock up in hi box and
drawn off by himself in a phial and administ to me through a
piec of quill in the cork when i wa suppos to be in want of a
restor sometim to make it a more sovereign specif he wa so
kind as to squeez orang juic into it or to stir it up with ginger
or dissolv a peppermint drop in it and although i cannot assert that
the flavour wa improv by these experi or that it wa exactli
the compound on would have chosen for a stomach the last thing at
night and the first thing in the morn i drank it gratefulli and wa
veri sensibl of hi attent
we seem to me to have been month over peregrin and month more over
the other stori the institut never flag for want of a stori i
am certain and the wine last out almost as well as the matter poor
traddlesi never think of that boi but with a strang disposit to
laugh and with tear in my eyeswa a sort of choru in gener
and affect to be convuls with mirth at the comic part and to be
overcom with fear when there wa ani passag of an alarm charact
in the narr thi rather put me out veri often it wa a great
jest of hi i recollect to pretend that he couldnt keep hi teeth
from chatter whenev mention wa made of an alguazil in connexion
with the adventur of gil bla and i rememb that when gil bla met
the captain of the robber in madrid thi unlucki joker counterfeit
such an agu of terror that he wa overheard by mr creakl who
wa prowl about the passag and handsom flog for disorderli
conduct in the bedroom whatev i had within me that wa romant and
dreami wa encourag by so much storytel in the dark and in that
respect the pursuit mai not have been veri profit to me but the
be cherish as a kind of playth in my room and the conscious
that thi accomplish of mine wa bruit about among the boi and
attract a good deal of notic to me though i wa the youngest there
stimul me to exert in a school carri on by sheer cruelti
whether it is presid over by a dunc or not there is not like to
be much learnt i believ our boi were gener as ignor a set
as ani schoolboi in exist thei were too much troubl and knock
about to learn thei could no more do that to advantag than ani on
can do anyth to advantag in a life of constant misfortun torment
and worri but my littl vaniti and steerforth help urg me on
somehow and without save me from much if anyth in the wai of
punish made me for the time i wa there an except to the
gener bodi insomuch that i did steadili pick up some crumb of
knowledg
in thi i wa much assist by mr mell who had a like for me that
i am grate to rememb it alwai gave me pain to observ that
steerforth treat him with systemat disparag and seldom lost
an occas of wound hi feel or induc other to do so
thi troubl me the more for a long time becaus i had soon told
steerforth from whom i could no more keep such a secret than i could
keep a cake or ani other tangibl possess about the two old women
mr mell had taken me to see and i wa alwai afraid that steerforth
would let it out and twit him with it
we littl thought ani on of us i dare sai when i at my breakfast
that first morn and went to sleep under the shadow of the peacock
feather to the sound of the flute what consequ would come of the
introduct into those almshous of my insignific person but the
visit had it unforeseen consequ and of a seriou sort too in
their wai
on dai when mr creakl kept the hous from indisposit which
natur diffus a live joi through the school there wa a good
deal of nois in the cours of the morn work the great relief and
satisfact experienc by the boi made them difficult to manag and
though the dread tungai brought hi wooden leg in twice or thrice and
took note of the princip offend name no great impress wa
made by it as thei were pretti sure of get into troubl tomorrow
do what thei would and thought it wise no doubt to enjoi themselv
todai
it wa properli a halfholidai be saturdai but as the nois in
the playground would have disturb mr creakl and the weather wa
not favour for go out walk we were order into school in the
afternoon and set some lighter task than usual which were made for
the occas it wa the dai of the week on which mr sharp went out to
get hi wig curl so mr mell who alwai did the drudgeri whatev
it wa kept school by himself if i could associ the idea of a bull
or a bear with anyon so mild as mr mell i should think of him in
connexion with that afternoon when the uproar wa at it height as of
on of those anim bait by a thousand dog i recal him bend
hi ach head support on hi boni hand over the book on hi desk
and wretchedli endeavour to get on with hi tiresom work amidst an
uproar that might have made the speaker of the hous of common giddi
boi start in and out of their place plai at puss in the corner

about him grin make face mimick him behind hi back and

with hi lip trembl more and more you commit a mean and base

liberti of call me mean or base or anyth of that sort you ar
an impud beggar you ar alwai a beggar you know but when you do
that you ar an impud beggar
i am not clear whether he wa go to strike mr mell or mr mell wa
go to strike him or there wa ani such intent on either side
i saw a rigid come upon the whole school as if thei had been turn
into stone and found mr creakl in the midst of us with tungai at hi
side and mr and miss creakl look in at the door as if thei were
frighten mr mell with hi elbow on hi desk and hi face in hi

anger on hi oppon and remain silent i could not help think
even in that interv i rememb what a nobl fellow he wa in

what did he mean by talk about favourit then said steerforth at
length

and prai what did you mean by that sir demand mr creakl
turn angrili on hi assist

should not have done so if i had been cool
here steerforth struck in
then he said i wa mean and then he said i wa base and then i call
him a beggar if i had been cool perhap i shouldnt have call him a
beggar but i did and i am readi to take the consequ of it
without consid perhap whether there were ani consequ to
be taken i felt quit in a glow at thi gallant speech it made an
impress on the boi too for there wa a low stir among them though
no on spoke a word
i am surpris steerforthalthough your candour doe you honour
said mr creakl doe you honour certainlyi am surpris
steerforth i must sai that you should attach such an epithet to ani
person emploi and paid in salem hous sir
steerforth gave a short laugh
that not an answer sir said mr creakl to my remark i expect
more than that from you steerforth
if mr mell look home in my ey befor the handsom boi it would
be quit imposs to sai how home mr creakl look let him deni

and to sai what i meanwhat i have to sai is that hi mother live

interest
onc more he laid hi hand upon my shoulder and then take hi
flute and a few book from hi desk and leav the kei in it for hi
successor he went out of the school with hi properti under hi arm
mr creakl then made a speech through tungai in which he thank
steerforth for assert though perhap too warmli the independ
and respect of salem hous and which he wound up by shake
hand with steerforth while we gave three cheersi did not quit know
what for but i suppos for steerforth and so join in them ardent
though i felt miser mr creakl then cane tommi traddl for
be discov in tear instead of cheer on account of mr mell
departur and went back to hi sofa or hi bed or wherev he had
come from
we were left to ourselv now and look veri blank i recollect on
on anoth for myself i felt so much selfreproach and contrit for
my part in what had happen that noth would have enabl me to keep
back my tear but the fear that steerforth who often look at me i
saw might think it unfriendlyor i should rather sai consid our
rel ag and the feel with which i regard him undutifulif
i show the emot which distress me he wa veri angri with
traddl and said he wa glad he had caught it
poor traddl who had pass the stage of ly with hi head upon the
desk and wa reliev himself as usual with a burst of skeleton said
he didnt care mr mell wa illus
who ha illus him you girl said steerforth

your miss traddl as to hi situationwhich wa a preciou on
wasnt itdo you suppos i am not go to write home and take care
that he get some monei polli
we thought thi intent veri nobl in steerforth whose mother wa
a widow and rich and would do almost anyth it wa said that he
ask her we were all extrem glad to see traddl so put down
and exalt steerforth to the ski especi when he told us as he
condescend to do that what he had done had been done expressli for
us and for our caus and that he had confer a great boon upon us
by unselfishli do it but i must sai that when i wa go on with a
stori in the dark that night mr mell old flute seem more than onc
to sound mournfulli in my ear and that when at last steerforth wa
tire and i lai down in my bed i fanci it plai so sorrowfulli
somewher that i wa quit wretch
i soon forgot him in the contempl of steerforth who in an easi
amateur wai and without ani book he seem to me to know everyth by
heart took some of hi class until a new master wa found the new
master came from a grammar school and befor he enter on hi duti
dine in the parlour on dai to be introduc to steerforth steerforth
approv of him highli and told us he wa a brick without exactli
understand what learn distinct wa meant by thi i respect
him greatli for it and had no doubt whatev of hi superior knowledg
though he never took the pain with menot that i wa anybodythat mr
mell had taken
there wa onli on other event in thi halfyear out of the daili
schoollif that made an impress upon me which still surviv it
surviv for mani reason
on afternoon when we were all harass into a state of dire confus
and mr creakl wa lai about him dreadfulli tungai came in and
call out in hi usual strong wai visitor for copperfield
a few word were interchang between him and mr creakl as who the
visitor were and what room thei were to be shown into and then i who
had accord to custom stood up on the announc be made and
felt quit faint with astonish wa told to go by the back stair
and get a clean frill on befor i repair to the diningroom these
order i obei in such a flutter and hurri of my young spirit as
i had never known befor and when i got to the parlour door and the
thought came into my head that it might be my motheri had onli thought

to open their heart to him in a moment
you must let them know at home if you pleas mr peggotti i said

season of the frosti morn when we were rung out of bed and the
cold cold smell of the dark night when we were rung into bed again of

seem for an immens time to be a stationari speck began to come
toward us and to grow and grow how from count month we came to
week and then to dai and how i then began to be afraid that i should
not be sent for and when i learnt from steerforth that i had been sent

ah what a strang feel it wa to be go home when it wa not home
and to find that everi object i look at remind me of the happi old
home which wa like a dream i could never dream again the dai when my
mother and i and peggotti were all in all to on anoth and there wa
no on to come between us rose up befor me so sorrowfulli on the road
that i am not sure i wa glad to be therenot sure but that i would
rather have remain awai and forgotten it in steerforth compani but
there i wa and soon i wa at our hous where the bare old elmtre
wrung their mani hand in the bleak wintri air and shred of the old
rooksnest drift awai upon the wind
the carrier put my box down at the gardeng and left me i walk
along the path toward the hous glanc at the window and fear
at everi step to see mr murdston or miss murdston lower out of
on of them no face appear howev and be come to the hous and
know how to open the door befor dark without knock i went in
with a quiet timid step
god know how infantin the memori mai have been that wa awaken
within me by the sound of my mother voic in the old parlour when i
set foot in the hall she wa sing in a low tone i think i must have
lain in her arm and heard her sing so to me when i wa but a babi
the strain wa new to me and yet it wa so old that it fill my heart
brimful like a friend come back from a long absenc
i believ from the solitari and thought wai in which my mother
murmur her song that she wa alon and i went softli into the room
she wa sit by the fire suckl an infant whose tini hand she
held against her neck her ey were look down upon it face and she
sat sing to it i wa so far right that she had no other companion
i spoke to her and she start and cri out but see me she
call me her dear davi her own boi and come half across the room
to meet me kneel down upon the ground and kiss me and laid my head
down on her bosom near the littl creatur that wa nestl there and
put it hand to my lip
i wish i had di i wish i had di then with that feel in my
heart i should have been more fit for heaven than i ever have been
sinc
he is your brother said my mother fondl me davi my pretti boi
my poor child then she kiss me more and more and clasp me round
the neck thi she wa do when peggotti came run in and bounc
down on the ground besid us and went mad about us both for a quarter
of an hour
it seem that i had not been expect so soon the carrier be much
befor hi usual time it seem too that mr and miss murdston had
gone out upon a visit in the neighbourhood and would not return befor
night i had never hope for thi i had never thought it possibl that
we three could be togeth undisturb onc more and i felt for the
time as if the old dai were come back
we dine togeth by the firesid peggotti wa in attend to wait
upon us but my mother wouldnt let her do it and made her dine with
us i had my own old plate with a brown view of a manofwar in full
sail upon it which peggotti had hoard somewher all the time i
had been awai and would not have had broken she said for a hundr
pound i had my own old mug with david on it and my own old littl
knife and fork that wouldnt cut
while we were at tabl i thought it a favour occas to tell
peggotti about mr barki who befor i had finish what i had to tell
her began to laugh and throw her apron over her face
peggotti said my mother what the matter
peggotti onli laugh the more and held her apron tight over her face
when my mother tri to pull it awai and sat as if her head were in a
bag
what ar you do you stupid creatur said my mother laugh
oh drat the man cri peggotti he want to marri me
it would be a veri good match for you wouldnt it said my mother
oh i dont know said peggotti dont ask me i wouldnt have him if
he wa made of gold nor i wouldnt have anybodi
then why dont you tell him so you ridicul thing said my mother
tell him so retort peggotti look out of her apron he ha
never said a word to me about it he know better if he wa to make so
bold as sai a word to me i should slap hi face
her own wa as red as ever i saw it or ani other face i think but she
onli cover it again for a few moment at a time when she wa taken
with a violent fit of laughter and after two or three of those attack
went on with her dinner
i remark that my mother though she smile when peggotti look at
her becam more seriou and thought i had seen at first that she
wa chang her face wa veri pretti still but it look careworn and
too delic and her hand wa so thin and white that it seem to me
to be almost transpar but the chang to which i now refer wa
superad to thi it wa in her manner which becam anxiou and
flutter at last she said put out her hand and lai it
affection on the hand of her old servant
peggotti dear you ar not go to be marri

my mother took her hand and said

hi wife why what put that in your silli littl headfor peggotti

run on in her own fashion

laugh about mr barki after that she took the babi out of it littl
cradl and nurs it after that she clear the dinner tabl
after that came in with anoth cap on and her workbox and the
yardmeasur and the bit of waxcandl all just the same as ever
we sat round the fire and talk delightfulli i told them what a hard
master mr creakl wa and thei piti me veri much i told them what a
fine fellow steerforth wa and what a patron of mine and peggotti said
she would walk a score of mile to see him i took the littl babi in
my arm when it wa awak and nurs it lovingli when it wa asleep
again i crept close to my mother side accord to my old custom
broken now a long time and sat with my arm embrac her waist and my
littl red cheek on her shoulder and onc more felt her beauti
hair droop over melik an angel wing as i us to think i
recollectand wa veri happi inde
while i sat thu look at the fire and see pictur in the
redhot coal i almost believ that i had never been awai that mr
and miss murdston were such pictur and would vanish when the fire
got low and that there wa noth real in all that i rememb save
my mother peggotti and i
peggotti darn awai at a stock as long as she could see and then
sat with it drawn on her left hand like a glove and her needl in her
right readi to take anoth stitch whenev there wa a blaze i cannot
conceiv whose stock thei can have been that peggotti wa alwai
darn or where such an unfail suppli of stock in want of
darn can have come from from my earliest infanc she seem to have
been alwai emploi in that class of needlework and never by ani
chanc in ani other

gate to meet me
peggotti wa not slow to respond and ratifi the treati of friendship by
give me on of her best hug i think i had some glimps of the real
charact of thi convers at the time but i am sure now that
the good creatur origin it and took her part in it mere that
my mother might comfort herself with the littl contradictori summari in
which she had indulg the design wa efficaci for i rememb that
my mother seem more at eas dure the rest of the even and that

in short i wa not a favourit with miss murdston in short i wa not
a favourit there with anybodi not even with myself for those who did
like me could not show it and those who did not show it so plainli
that i had a sensit conscious of alwai appear constrain
boorish and dull
i felt that i made them as uncomfort as thei made me if i came into
the room where thei were and thei were talk togeth and my mother
seem cheer an anxiou cloud would steal over her face from the
moment of my entranc if mr murdston were in hi best humour i
check him if miss murdston were in her worst i intensifi it i
had percept enough to know that my mother wa the victim alwai that
she wa afraid to speak to me or to be kind to me lest she should
give them some offenc by her manner of do so and receiv a
lectur afterward that she wa not onli ceaselessli afraid of her own
offend but of my offend and uneasili watch their look if i
onli move therefor i resolv to keep myself as much out of their wai
as i could and mani a wintri hour did i hear the church clock strike
when i wa sit in my cheerless bedroom wrap in my littl
greatcoat pore over a book
in the even sometim i went and sat with peggotti in the kitchen
there i wa comfort and not afraid of be myself but neither of
these resourc wa approv of in the parlour the torment humour
which wa domin there stop them both i wa still held to be
necessari to my poor mother train and as on of her trial could
not be suffer to absent myself

room no more i took refug with peggotti no more but sat wearili in
the parlour dai after dai look forward to night and bedtim
what irksom constraint i underw sit in the same attitud hour
upon hour afraid to move an arm or a leg lest miss murdston should
complain as she did on the least pretenc of my restless and
afraid to move an ey lest she should light on some look of dislik
or scrutini that would find new caus for complaint in mine what
intoler dul to sit listen to the tick of the clock and
watch miss murdston littl shini steel bead as she strung them
and wonder whether she would ever be marri and if so to what
sort of unhappi man and count the divis in the mould of the
chimneypiec and wander awai with my ey to the ceil among
the curl and corkscrew in the paper on the wall
what walk i took alon down muddi lane in the bad winter weather
carri that parlour and mr and miss murdston in it everywher a
monstrou load that i wa oblig to bear a daymar that there wa
no possibl of break in a weight that brood on my wit and
blunt them
what meal i had in silenc and embarrass alwai feel that there
were a knife and fork too mani and that mine an appetit too mani and
that mine a plate and chair too mani and those mine a somebodi too
mani and that i
what even when the candl came and i wa expect to emploi
myself but not dare to read an entertain book pore over some
hardhead harderheart treatis on arithmet when the tabl of
weight and measur set themselv to tune as rule britannia or
awai with melancholi when thei wouldnt stand still to be learnt but
would go thread my grandmoth needl through my unfortun head
in at on ear and out at the other what yawn and doze i laps into
in spite of all my care what start i came out of conceal sleep
with what answer i never got to littl observ that i rare
made what a blank space i seem which everybodi overlook and
yet wa in everybodi wai what a heavi relief it wa to hear miss
murdston hail the first stroke of nine at night and order me to bed
thu the holidai lag awai until the morn came when miss
murdston said here the last dai off and gave me the close cup
of tea of the vacat
i wa not sorri to go i had laps into a stupid state but i wa
recov a littl and look forward to steerforth albeit mr
creakl loom behind him again mr barki appear at the gate and
again miss murdston in her warn voic said clara when my mother
bent over me to bid me farewel
i kiss her and my babi brother and wa veri sorri then but not
sorri to go awai for the gulf between us wa there and the part wa
there everi dai and it is not so much the embrac she gave me that
live in my mind though it wa as fervent as could be as what follow
the embrac
i wa in the carrier cart when i heard her call to me i look
out and she stood at the gardeng alon hold her babi up in her
arm for me to see it wa cold still weather and not a hair of her
head nor a fold of her dress wa stir as she look intent at
me hold up her child
so i lost her so i saw her afterward in my sleep at schoola silent
presenc near my bedlook at me with the same intent facehold
up her babi in her arm
chapter 9 i have a memor birthdai
i pass over all that happen at school until the anniversari of my
birthdai came round in march except that steerforth wa more to be
admir than ever i rememb noth he wa go awai at the end of
the halfyear if not sooner and wa more spirit and independ than
befor in my ey and therefor more engag than befor but beyond
thi i rememb noth the great remembr by which that time is
mark in my mind seem to have swallow up all lesser recollect
and to exist alon
it is even difficult for me to believ that there wa a gap of full
two month between my return to salem hous and the arriv of that
birthdai i can onli understand that the fact wa so becaus i know it
must have been so otherwis i should feel convinc that there wa no
interv and that the on occas trod upon the other heel
how well i recollect the kind of dai it wa i smell the fog that hung
about the place i see the hoar frost ghostli through it i feel my
rimi hair fall clammi on my cheek i look along the dim perspect of
the schoolroom with a sputter candl here and there to light up the
foggi morn and the breath of the boi wreath and smoke in the
raw cold as thei blow upon their finger and tap their feet upon the
floor it wa after breakfast and we had been summon in from the
playground when mr sharp enter and said
david copperfield is to go into the parlour
i expect a hamper from peggotti and brighten at the order some
of the boi about me put in their claim not to be forgotten in the
distribut of the good thing as i got out of my seat with great
alacr
dont hurri david said mr sharp there time enough my boi
dont hurri
i might have been surpris by the feel tone in which he spoke if i
had given it a thought but i gave it none until afterward i hurri
awai to the parlour and there i found mr creakl sit at hi
breakfast with the cane and a newspap befor him and mr creakl
with an open letter in her hand but no hamper
david copperfield said mr creakl lead me to a sofa and
sit down besid me i want to speak to you veri particularli i
have someth to tell you my child
mr creakl at whom of cours i look shook hi head without look
at me and stop up a sigh with a veri larg piec of butter toast
you ar too young to know how the world chang everi dai said mr
creakl and how the peopl in it pass awai but we all have to learn
it david some of us when we ar young some of us when we ar old
some of us at all time of our live
i look at her earnestli
when you came awai from home at the end of the vacat said mr
creakl after a paus were thei all well after anoth paus wa
your mama well
i trembl without distinctli know why and still look at her
earnestli make no attempt to answer
becaus said she i griev to tell you that i hear thi morn your
mama is veri ill
a mist rose between mr creakl and me and her figur seem to move
in it for an instant then i felt the burn tear run down my face
and it wa steadi again
she is veri danger ill she ad
i knew all now
she is dead
there wa no need to tell me so i had alreadi broken out into a
desol cry and felt an orphan in the wide world
she wa veri kind to me she kept me there all dai and left me alon
sometim and i cri and wore myself to sleep and awok and
cri again when i could cry no more i began to think and then the
oppress on my breast wa heaviest and my grief a dull pain that
there wa no eas for
and yet my thought were idl not intent on the calam that weigh
upon my heart but idli loiter near it i thought of our hous shut
up and hush i thought of the littl babi who mr creakl said had
been pine awai for some time and who thei believ would die too i
thought of my father grave in the churchyard by our hous and of my
mother ly there beneath the tree i knew so well i stood upon a chair
when i wa left alon and look into the glass to see how red my ey
were and how sorrow my face i consid after some hour were
gone if my tear were realli hard to flow now as thei seem to be
what in connexion with my loss it would affect me most to think
of when i drew near homefor i wa go home to the funer i am
sensibl of have felt that a digniti attach to me among the rest of
the boi and that i wa import in my afflict
if ever child were stricken with sincer grief i wa but i rememb
that thi import wa a kind of satisfact to me when i walk in
the playground that afternoon while the boi were in school when i
saw them glanc at me out of the window as thei went up to their
class i felt distinguish and look more melancholi and walk
slower when school wa over and thei came out and spoke to me i felt
it rather good in myself not to be proud to ani of them and to take
exactli the same notic of them all as befor
i wa to go home next night not by the mail but by the heavi
nightcoach which wa call the farmer and wa princip us by
countrypeopl travel short intermedi distanc upon the road we

hi pillow i dont know what good he thought it would do me for i
had on of my own but it wa all he had to lend poor fellow except a
sheet of letterpap full of skeleton and that he gave me at part
as a soother of my sorrow and a contribut to my peac of mind

full of littl nail which he wa oblig to take out befor he could
speak

i will said mr omer rise my dear and he stop and turn to
me would you like to see your
no father minni interpos
i thought it might be agreeabl my dear said mr omer but perhap
your right
i cant sai how i knew it wa my dear dear mother coffin that thei
went to look at i had never heard on make i had never seen on that
i know ofbut it came into my mind what the nois wa while it wa
go on and when the young man enter i am sure i knew what he had
been do
the work be now finish the two girl whose name i had not heard
brush the shred and thread from their dress and went into the
shop to put that to right and wait for custom minni stai behind
to fold up what thei had made and pack it in two basket thi she did
upon her knee hum a live littl tune the while joram who i had
no doubt wa her lover came in and stole a kiss from her while she wa
busi he didnt appear to mind me at all and said her father wa gone
for the chais and he must make hast and get himself readi then he
went out again and then she put her thimbl and scissor in her pocket
and stuck a needl thread with black thread neatli in the bosom of her
gown and put on her outer cloth smartli at a littl glass behind
the door in which i saw the reflect of her pleas face
all thi i observ sit at the tabl in the corner with my head
lean on my hand and my thought run on veri differ thing
the chais soon came round to the front of the shop and the basket
be put in first i wa put in next and those three follow i
rememb it as a kind of half chaisecart half pianofortevan paint
of a sombr colour and drawn by a black hors with a long tail there
wa plenti of room for us all
i do not think i have ever experienc so strang a feel in my life
i am wiser now perhap as that of be with them rememb how
thei had been emploi and see them enjoi the ride i wa not angri
with them i wa more afraid of them as if i were cast awai among
creatur with whom i had no commun of natur thei were veri
cheer the old man sat in front to drive and the two young peopl
sat behind him and whenev he spoke to them lean forward the on on
on side of hi chubbi face and the other on the other and made a great
deal of him thei would have talk to me too but i held back and
mope in my corner scare by their lovemak and hilar though
it wa far from boister and almost wonder that no judgement came
upon them for their hard of heart
so when thei stop to bait the hors and at and drank and enjoi
themselv i could touch noth that thei touch but kept my fast
unbroken so when we reach home i drop out of the chais behind
as quickli as possibl that i might not be in their compani befor
those solemn window look blindli on me like close ey onc
bright and oh how littl need i had had to think what would move me to
tear when i came backse the window of my mother room and next
it that which in the better time wa mine
i wa in peggotti arm befor i got to the door and she took me into
the hous her grief burst out when she first saw me but she control
it soon and spoke in whisper and walk softli as if the dead could
be disturb she had not been in bed i found for a long time she
sat up at night still and watch as long as her poor dear pretti wa
abov the ground she said she would never desert her
mr murdston took no heed of me when i went into the parlour where he
wa but sat by the firesid weep silent and ponder in hi
elbowchair miss murdston who wa busi at her writingdesk which
wa cover with letter and paper gave me her cold fingernail and
ask me in an iron whisper if i had been measur for my mourn
i said ye
and your shirt said miss murdston have you brought em home
ye maam i have brought home all my cloth
thi wa all the consol that her firm administ to me i do
not doubt that she had a choic pleasur in exhibit what she call
her selfcommand and her firm and her strength of mind and
her common sens and the whole diabol catalogu of her unami
qualiti on such an occas she wa particularli proud of her turn
for busi and she show it now in reduc everyth to pen and
ink and be move by noth all the rest of that dai and from
morn to night afterward she sat at that desk scratch composedli
with a hard pen speak in the same imperturb whisper to
everybodi never relax a muscl of her face or soften a tone of
her voic or appear with an atom of her dress astrai
her brother took a book sometim but never read it that i saw he
would open it and look at it as if he were read but would remain for
a whole hour without turn the leaf and then put it down and walk to
and fro in the room i us to sit with fold hand watch him and
count hi footstep hour after hour he veri seldom spoke to her
and never to me he seem to be the onli restless thing except the
clock in the whole motionless hous
in these dai befor the funer i saw but littl of peggotti except
that in pass up or down stair i alwai found her close to the room
where my mother and her babi lai and except that she came to me everi
night and sat by my bed head while i went to sleep a dai or
two befor the buriali think it wa a dai or two befor but i am
consciou of confus in my mind about that heavi time with noth
to mark it progresssh took me into the room i onli recollect that
underneath some white cover on the bed with a beauti cleanli
and fresh all around it there seem to me to lie embodi the
solemn still that wa in the hous and that when she would have
turn the cover gentli back i cri oh no oh no and held her
hand
if the funer had been yesterdai i could not recollect it better the
veri air of the best parlour when i went in at the door the bright
condit of the fire the shine of the wine in the decant the
pattern of the glass and plate the faint sweet smell of cake the
odour of miss murdston dress and our black cloth mr chillip is
in the room and come to speak to me

there ar mr murdston our neighbour mr grayper mr chillip and
i when we go out to the door the bearer and their load ar in the
garden and thei move befor us down the path and past the elm and
through the gate and into the churchyard where i have so often heard
the bird sing on a summer morn
we stand around the grave the dai seem differ to me from everi
other dai and the light not of the same colourof a sadder colour
now there is a solemn hush which we have brought from home with what is
rest in the mould and while we stand barehead i hear the voic
of the clergyman sound remot in the open air and yet distinct and
plain sai i am the resurrect and the life saith the lord
then i hear sob and stand apart among the lookerson i see that
good and faith servant whom of all the peopl upon earth i love the
best and unto whom my childish heart is certain that the lord will on

knew in church when mine wa alwai wonder there face that first
saw my mother when she came to the villag in her youth bloom i do
not mind themi mind noth but my griefand yet i see and know them

leav to go up to my room dismiss me with the gentl of a woman
all thi i sai is yesterdai event event of later date have float
from me to the shore where all forgotten thing will reappear but thi

of the time the dai wa so like sundai i have forgotten that wa
suit to us both she sat down by my side upon my littl bed and
hold my hand and sometim put it to her lip and sometim
smooth it with her as she might have comfort my littl brother
told me in her wai all that she had to tell concern what had

in her mind and not happi when her babi wa born i thought at first
she would get better but she wa more delic and sunk a littl everi
dai she us to like to sit alon befor her babi came and then she
cri but afterward she us to sing to itso soft that i onc
thought when i heard her it wa like a voic up in the air that wa
rise awai
i think she got to be more timid and more frightenedlik of late
and that a hard word wa like a blow to her but she wa alwai the same
to me she never chang to her foolish peggotti didnt my sweet girl
here peggotti stop and softli beat upon my hand a littl while
the last time that i saw her like her own old self wa the night when
you came home my dear the dai you went awai she said to me i never
shall see my pretti darl again someth tell me so that tell the
truth i know
she tri to hold up after that and mani a time when thei told her

it wa pretti far in the night said peggotti when she ask me for
some drink and when she had taken it gave me such a patient smile the
dearso beauti
daybreak had come and the sun wa rise when she said to me how
kind and consider mr copperfield had alwai been to her and how
he had born with her and told her when she doubt herself that
a love heart wa better and stronger than wisdom and that he wa a
happi man in her peggotti my dear she said then put me nearer to
you for she wa veri weak lai your good arm underneath my neck she
said and turn me to you for your face is go far off and i want it
to be near i put it as she ask and oh davi the time had come when
my first part word to you were truewhen she wa glad to lai her
poor head on her stupid cross old peggotti armand she di like a
child that had gone to sleep
thu end peggotti narrat from the moment of my know of the
death of my mother the idea of her as she had been of late had vanish
from me i rememb her from that instant onli as the young mother
of my earliest impress who had been us to wind her bright curl
round and round her finger and to danc with me at twilight in the
parlour what peggotti had told me now wa so far from bring me back
to the later period that it root the earlier imag in my mind it mai
be curiou but it is true in her death she wing her wai back to her
calm untroubl youth and cancel all the rest
the mother who lai in the grave wa the mother of my infanc the
littl creatur in her arm wa myself as i had onc been hush for
ever on her bosom
chapter 10 i becom neglect and am provid for
the first act of busi miss murdston perform when the dai of the
solemn wa over and light wa freeli admit into the hous wa
to give peggotti a month warn much as peggotti would have dislik
such a servic i believ she would have retain it for my sake in
prefer to the best upon earth she told me we must part and told me
why and we condol with on anoth in all sincer
as to me or my futur not a word wa said or a step taken happi
thei would have been i dare sai if thei could have dismiss me at a
month warn too i muster courag onc to ask miss murdston when
i wa go back to school and she answer dryli she believ i wa
not go back at all i wa told noth more i wa veri anxiou to
know what wa go to be done with me and so wa peggotti but neither
she nor i could pick up ani inform on the subject
there wa on chang in my condit which while it reliev me of
a great deal of present uneasi might have made me if i had been
capabl of consid it close yet more uncomfort about the
futur it wa thi the constraint that had been put upon me wa quit
abandon i wa so far from be requir to keep my dull post in
the parlour that on sever occas when i took my seat there miss
murdston frown to me to go awai i wa so far from be warn off
from peggotti societi that provid i wa not in mr murdston i
wa never sought out or inquir for at first i wa in daili dread of
hi take my educ in hand again or of miss murdston
devot herself to it but i soon began to think that such fear were
groundless and that all i had to anticip wa neglect
i do not conceiv that thi discoveri gave me much pain then i wa
still giddi with the shock of my mother death and in a kind of
stun state as to all tributari thing i can recollect inde to
have specul at odd time on the possibl of my not be taught
ani more or care for ani more and grow up to be a shabbi moodi
man loung an idl life awai about the villag as well as on the
feasibl of my get rid of thi pictur by go awai somewher
like the hero in a stori to seek my fortun but these were transient
vision daydream i sat look at sometim as if thei were faintli
paint or written on the wall of my room and which as thei melt
awai left the wall blank again
peggotti i said in a thought whisper on even when i wa
warm my hand at the kitchen fire mr murdston like me less than
he us to he never like me much peggotti but he would rather not
even see me now if he can help it
perhap it hi sorrow said peggotti stroke my hair
i am sure peggotti i am sorri too if i believ it wa hi sorrow
i should not think of it at all but it not that oh no it not
that
how do you know it not that said peggotti after a silenc
oh hi sorrow is anoth and quit a differ thing he is sorri at
thi moment sit by the firesid with miss murdston but if i wa
to go in peggotti he would be someth besid
what would he be said peggotti
angri i answer with an involuntari imit of hi dark frown
if he wa onli sorri he wouldnt look at me as he doe i am onli
sorri and it make me feel kinder
peggotti said noth for a littl while and i warm my hand as
silent as she
davi she said at length
ye peggotti i have tri my dear all wai i could think ofal
the wai there ar and all the wai there aint in shortto get a
suitabl servic here in blunderston but there no such a thing my
love
and what do you mean to do peggotti sai i wistfulli do you mean
to go and seek your fortun
i expect i shall be forc to go to yarmouth repli peggotti and
live there
you might have gone farther off i said brighten a littl and
been as bad as lost i shall see you sometim my dear old peggotti
there you wont be quit at the other end of the world will you
contrari wai pleas god cri peggotti with great anim as
long as you ar here my pet i shall come over everi week of my life to
see you on dai everi week of my life
i felt a great weight taken off my mind by thi promis but even thi
wa not all for peggotti went on to sai
im ago davi you see to my brother first for anoth
fortnight visitjust till i have had time to look about me and
get to be someth like myself again now i have been think that
perhap as thei dont want you here at present you might be let to go
along with me
if anyth short of be in a differ relat to everi on about
me peggotti except could have given me a sens of pleasur at that
time it would have been thi project of all other the idea of be
again surround by those honest face shine welcom on me of
renew the peac of the sweet sundai morn when the bell
were ring the stone drop in the water and the shadowi ship
break through the mist of roam up and down with littl emli
tell her my troubl and find charm against them in the shell
and pebbl on the beach made a calm in my heart it wa ruffl next
moment to be sure by a doubt of miss murdston give her consent
but even that wa set at rest soon for she came out to take an even
grope in the storecloset while we were yet in convers and
peggotti with a bold that amaz me broach the topic on the
spot
the boi will be idl there said miss murdston look into a
picklejar and idl is the root of all evil but to be sure he
would be idl hereor anywher in my opinion
peggotti had an angri answer readi i could see but she swallow it
for my sake and remain silent
humph said miss murdston still keep her ey on the pickl
it is of more import than anyth elseit is of paramount
importancethat my brother should not be disturb or made
uncomfort i suppos i had better sai ye
i thank her without make ani demonstr of joi lest it should
induc her to withdraw her assent nor could i help think thi a
prudent cours sinc she look at me out of the picklejar with
as great an access of sour as if her black ey had absorb it
content howev the permiss wa given and wa never retract
for when the month wa out peggotti and i were readi to depart
mr barki came into the hous for peggotti box i had never known
him to pass the gardeng befor but on thi occas he came into
the hous and he gave me a look as he shoulder the largest box and
went out which i thought had mean in it if mean could ever be
said to find it wai into mr barkiss visag
peggotti wa natur in low spirit at leav what had been her home
so mani year and where the two strong attach of her lifefor
my mother and myselfhad been form she had been walk in the
churchyard too veri earli and she got into the cart and sat in it
with her handkerchief at her ey
so long as she remain in thi condit mr barki gave no sign
of life whatev he sat in hi usual place and attitud like a great
stuf figur but when she began to look about her and to speak to
me he nod hi head and grin sever time i have not the least
notion at whom or what he meant by it
it a beauti dai mr barki i said as an act of polit
it aint bad said mr barki who gener qualifi hi speech and
rare commit himself
peggotti is quit comfort now mr barki i remark for hi
satisfact
is she though said mr barki
after reflect about it with a sagaci air mr barki ei her
and said
ar you pretti comfort
peggotti laugh and answer in the affirm
but realli and truli you know ar you growl mr barki slide
nearer to her on the seat and nudg her with hi elbow ar you
realli and truli pretti comfort ar you eh
at each of these inquiri mr barki shuffl nearer to her and gave
her anoth nudg so that at last we were all crowd togeth in the
lefthand corner of the cart and i wa so squeez that i could hardli
bear it
peggotti call hi attent to my suffer mr barki gave me a
littl more room at onc and got awai by degre but i could not help

engag said in a low voic which he shade with hi hand the old
un from thi i rightli conjectur that no improv had taken
place sinc my last visit in the state of mr gummidg spirit
now the whole place wa or it should have been quit as delight
a place as ever and yet it did not impress me in the same wai i felt

dimpl face look brighter and her whole self prettier and gayer a
curiou feel came over me that made me pretend not to know her and

onli go and lai her cheek against hi rough whisker that wa my
opinion at least when i saw her do it and i held mr peggotti to be

awai till it wa nearli bedtim
i lai down in the old littl bed in the stern of the boat and the wind
came moan on across the flat as it had done befor but i could not
help fanci now that it moan of those who were gone and instead
of think that the sea might rise in the night and float the boat
awai i thought of the sea that had risen sinc i last heard those
sound and drown my happi home i recollect as the wind and water
began to sound fainter in my ear put a short claus into my
prayer petit that i might grow up to marri littl emli and so
drop lovingli asleep
the dai pass pretti much as thei had pass befor exceptit wa
a great exceptionthat littl emli and i seldom wander on the beach
now she had task to learn and needlework to do and wa absent
dure a great part of each dai but i felt that we should not have had
those old wander even if it had been otherwis wild and full of
childish whim as emli wa she wa more of a littl woman than i
had suppos she seem to have got a great distanc awai from me
in littl more than a year she like me but she laugh at me and
torment me and when i went to meet her stole home anoth wai and
wa laugh at the door when i came back disappoint the best time
were when she sat quietli at work in the doorwai and i sat on the
wooden step at her feet read to her it seem to me at thi
hour that i have never seen such sunlight as on those bright april
afternoon that i have never seen such a sunni littl figur as i us
to see sit in the doorwai of the old boat that i have never beheld
such sky such water such glorifi ship sail awai into golden air
on the veri first even after our arriv mr barki appear in an
exceedingli vacant and awkward condit and with a bundl of orang
ti up in a handkerchief as he made no allus of ani kind to thi
properti he wa suppos to have left it behind him by accid when
he went awai until ham run after him to restor it came back with
the inform that it wa intend for peggotti after that occas
he appear everi even at exactli the same hour and alwai with a
littl bundl to which he never allud and which he regularli put
behind the door and left there these offer of affect were of a
most variou and eccentr descript among them i rememb a doubl
set of pig trotter a huge pincushion half a bushel or so of
appl a pair of jet ear some spanish onion a box of domino
a canari bird and cage and a leg of pickl pork
mr barkiss woo as i rememb it wa altogeth of a peculiar
kind he veri seldom said anyth but would sit by the fire in much
the same attitud as he sat in hi cart and stare heavili at peggotti
who wa opposit on night be as i suppos inspir by love he
made a dart at the bit of waxcandl she kept for her thread and put
it in hi waistcoatpocket and carri it off after that hi great
delight wa to produc it when it wa want stick to the line of
hi pocket in a partial melt state and pocket it again when it wa
done with he seem to enjoi himself veri much and not to feel at all
call upon to talk even when he took peggotti out for a walk on the
flat he had no uneasi on that head i believ content himself
with now and then ask her if she wa pretti comfort and i
rememb that sometim after he wa gone peggotti would throw her
apron over her face and laugh for halfanhour inde we were
all more or less amus except that miser mr gummidg whose
courtship would appear to have been of an exactli parallel natur she
wa so continu remind by these transact of the old on
at length when the term of my visit wa nearli expir it wa given
out that peggotti and mr barki were go to make a dai holidai
togeth and that littl emli and i were to accompani them i had but
a broken sleep the night befor in anticip of the pleasur of
a whole dai with emli we were all astir betim in the morn and
while we were yet at breakfast mr barki appear in the distanc
drive a chaisecart toward the object of hi affect
peggotti wa dress as usual in her neat and quiet mourn but mr
barki bloom in a new blue coat of which the tailor had given him
such good measur that the cuff would have render glove unnecessari
in the coldest weather while the collar wa so high that it push hi
hair up on end on the top of hi head hi bright button too were
of the largest size render complet by drab pantaloon and a buff
waistcoat i thought mr barki a phenomenon of respect
when we were all in a bustl outsid the door i found that mr peggotti
wa prepar with an old shoe which wa to be thrown after us for luck
and which he offer to mr gummidg for that purpos
no it had better be done by somebodi els danl said mr gummidg
im a lone lorn creetur myself and everythink that remind me of
creetur that aint lone and lorn goe contrari with me
come old gal cri mr peggotti take and heav it
no danl return mr gummidg whimper and shake her head
if i felt less i could do more you dont feel like me danl think
dont go contrari with you nor you with them you had better do it
yourself
but here peggotti who had been go about from on to anoth in a
hurri wai kiss everybodi call out from the cart in which we
all were by thi time emli and i on two littl chair side by side
that mr gummidg must do it so mr gummidg did it and i am sorri
to relat cast a damp upon the festiv charact of our departur by
immedi burst into tear and sink subdu into the arm of
ham with the declar that she know she wa a burden and had
better be carri to the hous at onc which i realli thought wa a
sensibl idea that ham might have act on
awai we went howev on our holidai excurs and the first thing
we did wa to stop at a church where mr barki ti the hors to some
rail and went in with peggotti leav littl emli and me alon in
the chais i took that occas to put my arm round emli waist and
propos that as i wa go awai so veri soon now we should determin
to be veri affection to on anoth and veri happi all dai littl
emli consent and allow me to kiss her i becam desper
inform her i recollect that i never could love anoth and that
i wa prepar to shed the blood of anybodi who should aspir to her
affect
how merri littl emli made herself about it with what a demur
assumpt of be immens older and wiser than i the fairi littl
woman said i wa a silli boi and then laugh so charmingli that
i forgot the pain of be call by that disparag name in the
pleasur of look at her
mr barki and peggotti were a good while in the church but came out at
last and then we drove awai into the countri as we were go along
mr barki turn to me and said with a winkbi the by i should
hardli have thought befor that he could wink
what name wa it as i wrote up in the cart
clara peggotti i answer
what name would it be as i should write up now if there wa a tilt
here
clara peggotti again i suggest
clara peggotti barki he return and burst into a roar of laughter
that shook the chais
in a word thei were marri and had gone into the church for no other
purpos peggotti wa resolv that it should be quietli done and
the clerk had given her awai and there had been no wit of the
ceremoni she wa a littl confus when mr barki made thi abrupt
announc of their union and could not hug me enough in token of her
unimpair affect but she soon becam herself again and said she
wa veri glad it wa over
we drove to a littl inn in a byroad where we were expect and
where we had a veri comfort dinner and pass the dai with great
satisfact if peggotti had been marri everi dai for the last ten
year she could hardli have been more at her eas about it it made no
sort of differ in her she wa just the same as ever and went
out for a stroll with littl emli and me befor tea while mr barki
philosoph smoke hi pipe and enjoi himself i suppos with
the contempl of hi happi if so it sharpen hi appetit
for i distinctli call to mind that although he had eaten a good deal of
pork and green at dinner and had finish off with a fowl or two he
wa oblig to have cold boil bacon for tea and dispos of a larg
quantiti without ani emot
i have often thought sinc what an odd innoc outofthewai kind
of wed it must have been we got into the chais again soon after
dark and drove cosili back look up at the star and talk about
them i wa their chief expon and open mr barkiss mind to
an amaz extent i told him all i knew but he would have believ
anyth i might have taken it into my head to impart to him for he
had a profound vener for my abil and inform hi wife in my
hear on that veri occas that i wa a young roeshusbi which i
think he meant prodigi
when we had exhaust the subject of the star or rather when i had
exhaust the mental faculti of mr barki littl emli and i made a
cloak of an old wrapper and sat under it for the rest of the journei
ah how i love her what happi i thought if we were marri
and were go awai anywher to live among the tree and in the field
never grow older never grow wiser children ever rambl hand
in hand through sunshin and among floweri meadow lai down our
head on moss at night in a sweet sleep of puriti and peac and buri
by the bird when we were dead some such pictur with no real world in
it bright with the light of our innoc and vagu as the star afar
off wa in my mind all the wai i am glad to think there were two such
guileless heart at peggotti marriag as littl emli and mine i
am glad to think the love and grace took such airi form in it home
process
well we came to the old boat again in good time at night and there
mr and mr barki bade us goodby and drove awai snugli to their
own home i felt then for the first time that i had lost peggotti i
should have gone to bed with a sore heart inde under ani other roof
but that which shelter littl emli head
mr peggotti and ham knew what wa in my thought as well as i did and
were readi with some supper and their hospit face to drive it awai
littl emli came and sat besid me on the locker for the onli time in
all that visit and it wa altogeth a wonder close to a wonder
dai
it wa a night tide and soon after we went to bed mr peggotti and ham
went out to fish i felt veri brave at be left alon in the solitari
hous the protector of emli and mr gummidg and onli wish that
a lion or a serpent or ani illdispos monster would make an attack
upon us that i might destroi him and cover myself with glori but as
noth of the sort happen to be walk about on yarmouth flat that
night i provid the best substitut i could by dream of dragon
until morn
with morn came peggotti who call to me as usual under my window
as if mr barki the carrier had been from first to last a dream too
after breakfast she took me to her own home and a beauti littl
home it wa of all the moveabl in it i must have been impress by
a certain old bureau of some dark wood in the parlour the tilefloor
kitchen wa the gener sittingroom with a retreat top which
open let down and becam a desk within which wa a larg quarto
edit of fox book of martyr thi preciou volum of which i do
not recollect on word i immedi discov and immedi appli
myself to and i never visit the hous afterward but i kneel on
a chair open the casket where thi gem wa enshrin spread my arm
over the desk and fell to devour the book afresh i wa chiefli
edifi i am afraid by the pictur which were numer and
repres all kind of dismal horror but the martyr and peggotti
hous have been insepar in my mind ever sinc and ar now
i took leav of mr peggotti and ham and mr gummidg and littl
emli that dai and pass the night at peggotti in a littl room
in the roof with the crocodil book on a shelf by the bed head which
wa to be alwai mine peggotti said and should alwai be kept for me
in exactli the same state
young or old davi dear as long as i am aliv and have thi hous over
my head said peggotti you shall find it as if i expect you here
directli minut i shall keep it everi dai as i us to keep your old
littl room my darl and if you wa to go to china you might think
of it as be kept just the same all the time you were awai
i felt the truth and constanc of my dear old nurs with all my heart
and thank her as well as i could that wa not veri well for she
spoke to me thu with her arm round my neck in the morn and i wa
go home in the morn and i went home in the morn with herself
and mr barki in the cart thei left me at the gate not easili or
lightli and it wa a strang sight to me to see the cart go on take
peggotti awai and leav me under the old elmtre look at the
hous in which there wa no face to look on mine with love or like
ani more
and now i fell into a state of neglect which i cannot look back upon
without compass i fell at onc into a solitari conditionapart
from all friendli notic apart from the societi of all other boi of
my own ag apart from all companionship but my own spiritless
thoughtswhich seem to cast it gloom upon thi paper as i write
what would i have given to have been sent to the hardest school that
ever wa keptto have been taught someth anyhow anywher no
such hope dawn upon me thei dislik me and thei sullenli sternli
steadili overlook me i think mr murdston mean were straiten
at about thi time but it is littl to the purpos he could not bear
me and in put me from him he tri as i believ to put awai the
notion that i had ani claim upon himand succeed
i wa not activ illus i wa not beaten or starv but the wrong
that wa done to me had no interv of relent and wa done in a
systemat passionless manner dai after dai week after week month
after month i wa coldli neglect i wonder sometim when i think
of it what thei would have done if i had been taken with an ill
whether i should have lain down in my lone room and languish
through it in my usual solitari wai or whether anybodi would have
help me out
when mr and miss murdston were at home i took my meal with them in
their absenc i at and drank by myself at all time i loung about
the hous and neighbourhood quit disregard except that thei were
jealou of my make ani friend think perhap that if i did i
might complain to someon for thi reason though mr chillip often
ask me to go and see him he wa a widow have some year befor
that lost a littl small lighthair wife whom i can just rememb
connect in my own thought with a pale tortoiseshel cat it wa
but seldom that i enjoi the happi of pass an afternoon in hi
closet of a surgeri read some book that wa new to me with
the smell of the whole pharmacopoeia come up my nose or pound
someth in a mortar under hi mild direct
for the same reason ad no doubt to the old dislik of her i wa
seldom allow to visit peggotti faith to her promis she either
came to see me or met me somewher near onc everi week and never
emptyhand but mani and bitter were the disappoint i had in
be refus permiss to pai a visit to her at her hous some few
time howev at long interv i wa allow to go there and then
i found out that mr barki wa someth of a miser or as peggotti
dutifulli express it wa a littl near and kept a heap of monei
in a box under hi bed which he pretend wa onli full of coat
and trouser in thi coffer hi rich hid themselv with such a
tenaci modesti that the smallest instal could onli be tempt
out by artific so that peggotti had to prepar a long and elabor
scheme a veri gunpowd plot for everi saturdai expens
all thi time i wa so consciou of the wast of ani promis i had
given and of my be utterli neglect that i should have been
perfectli miser i have no doubt but for the old book thei were
my onli comfort and i wa as true to them as thei were to me and read
them over and over i dont know how mani time more
i now approach a period of my life which i can never lose the
remembr of while i rememb anyth and the recollect of
which ha often without my invoc come befor me like a ghost and
haunt happier time
i had been out on dai loiter somewher in the listless
medit manner that my wai of life engend when turn the
corner of a lane near our hous i came upon mr murdston walk with
a gentleman i wa confus and wa go by them when the gentleman

sheffield that your name

had gone over to lowestoft with mr murdston to see beforeit is no
matteri need not recal when

mr quinion
he had put hi hand upon my shoulder and turn me about to walk
with them i did not know what to repli and glanc dubious at mr
murdston

that old doubl look wa on me for a moment and then hi ey darken
with a frown as it turn in it avers elsewher

shoulder from hi hand and go awai when he said

ay he is sharp enough said mr murdston impati you had
better let him go he will not thank you for troubl him
on thi hint mr quinion releas me and i made the best of my
wai home look back as i turn into the front garden i saw mr
murdston lean against the wicket of the churchyard and mr quinion
talk to him thei were both look after me and i felt that thei
were speak of me
mr quinion lai at our hous that night after breakfast the next
morn i had put my chair awai and wa go out of the room when
mr murdston call me back he then grave repair to anoth tabl
where hi sister sat herself at her desk mr quinion with hi hand
in hi pocket stood look out of window and i stood look at them

david said mr murdston to the young thi is a world for action
not for mope and drone in as you do ad hi sister
jane murdston leav it to me if you pleas i sai david to the
young thi is a world for action and not for mope and drone in it
is especi so for a young boi of your disposit which requir a
great deal of correct and to which no greater servic can be done
than to forc it to conform to the wai of the work world and to
bend it and break it
for stubborn wont do here said hi sister what it want is to
be crush and crush it must be shall be too
he gave her a look half in remonstr half in approv and went on

costli and even if it were not and i could afford it i am of opinion
that it would not be at all advantag to you to be kept at school
what is befor you is a fight with the world and the sooner you begin
it the better
i think it occur to me that i had alreadi begun it in my poor wai
but it occur to me now whether or no

i thank him with all my heart for it wa friendli in him to offer to
take that troubl
at what hour said mr micawb shall i
at about eight said mr quinion
at about eight said mr micawb i beg to wish you good dai mr
quinion i will intrud no longer
so he put on hi hat and went out with hi cane under hi arm veri
upright and hum a tune when he wa clear of the countinghous
mr quinion then formal engag me to be as us as i could in
the warehous of murdston and grinbi at a salari i think of six
shill a week i am not clear whether it wa six or seven i am
inclin to believ from my uncertainti on thi head that it wa six
at first and seven afterward he paid me a week down from hi own
pocket i believ and i gave meali sixpenc out of it to get my
trunk carri to windsor terrac that night it be too heavi for my
strength small as it wa i paid sixpenc more for my dinner which wa
a meat pie and a turn at a neighbour pump and pass the hour which
wa allow for that meal in walk about the street
at the appoint time in the even mr micawb reappear i wash
my hand and face to do the greater honour to hi gentil and we
walk to our hous as i suppos i must now call it togeth mr
micawb impress the name of street and the shape of corner hous
upon me as we went along that i might find my wai back easili in the
morn
arriv at thi hous in windsor terrac which i notic wa shabbi
like himself but also like himself made all the show it could he
present me to mr micawb a thin and fade ladi not at all
young who wa sit in the parlour the first floor wa altogeth
unfurnish and the blind were kept down to delud the neighbour
with a babi at her breast thi babi wa on of twin and i mai remark
here that i hardli ever in all my experi of the famili saw both
the twin detach from mr micawb at the same time on of them wa
alwai take refresh
there were two other children master micawb ag about four and
miss micawb ag about three these and a darkcomplexion young
woman with a habit of snort who wa servant to the famili and
inform me befor half an hour had expir that she wa a orfl
and came from st luke workhous in the neighbourhood complet the
establish my room wa at the top of the hous at the back a close
chamber stencil all over with an ornament which my young imagin
repres as a blue muffin and veri scantili furnish
i never thought said mr micawb when she came up twin and all
to show me the apart and sat down to take breath befor i wa
marri when i live with papa and mama that i should ever find it
necessari to take a lodger but mr micawb be in difficulti all
consider of privat feel must give wai
i said ye maam
mr micawb difficulti ar almost overwhelm just at present
said mr micawb and whether it is possibl to bring him through
them i dont know when i live at home with papa and mama i realli
should have hardli understood what the word meant in the sens in which
i now emploi it but experientia doe ita papa us to sai
i cannot satisfi myself whether she told me that mr micawb had been
an offic in the marin or whether i have imagin it i onli know
that i believ to thi hour that he wa in the marin onc upon a time
without know why he wa a sort of town travel for a number
of miscellan hous now but made littl or noth of it i am
afraid
if mr micawb creditor will not give him time said mr
micawb thei must take the consequ and the sooner thei bring it
to an issu the better blood cannot be obtain from a stone neither
can anyth on account be obtain at present not to mention law
expens from mr micawb
i never can quit understand whether my precoci selfdepend
confus mr micawb in refer to my ag or whether she wa so
full of the subject that she would have talk about it to the veri
twin if there had been nobodi els to commun with but thi wa
the strain in which she began and she went on accordingli all the time
i knew her
poor mr micawb she said she had tri to exert herself and so
i have no doubt she had the centr of the street door wa perfectli
cover with a great brassplat on which wa engrav mr micawb
board establish for young ladi but i never found that ani
young ladi had ever been to school there or that ani young ladi ever
came or propos to come or that the least prepar wa ever made
to receiv ani young ladi the onli visitor i ever saw or heard of
were creditor thei us to come at all hour and some of them were

hear come receiv no answer to these taunt he would mount in
hi wrath to the word swindler and robber and these be
ineffectu too would sometim go to the extrem of cross the
street and roar up at the window of the second floor where he knew
mr micawb wa at these time mr micawb would be transport with
grief and mortif even to the length as i wa onc made awar by
a scream from hi wife of make motion at himself with a razor
but within halfanhour afterward he would polish up hi shoe with
extraordinari pain and go out hum a tune with a greater air of
gentil than ever mr micawb wa quit as elast i have known
her to be thrown into faint fit by the king tax at three
oclock and to eat lamb chop bread and drink warm al paid for
with two teaspoon that had gone to the pawnbrok at four on on

myself on that monei all the week from mondai morn until saturdai

i wa so young and childish and so littl qualifiedhow could i be
otherwiseto undertak the whole charg of my own exist that
often in go to murdston and grinbi of a morn i could
not resist the stale pastri put out for sale at halfpric at the

i have stroll at such a time as far as covent garden market and
stare at the pineappl i wa fond of wander about the adelphi
becaus it wa a mysteri place with those dark arch i see myself
emerg on even from some of these arch on a littl publichous
close to the river with an open space befor it where some
coalheav were danc to look at whom i sat down upon a bench i
wonder what thei thought of me
i wa such a child and so littl that frequent when i went into the
bar of a strang publichous for a glass of al or porter to moisten
what i had had for dinner thei were afraid to give it me i rememb
on hot even i went into the bar of a publichous and said to the

special occas i dont know what it mai have been my birthdai
twopencehalfpenni sai the landlord is the price of the genuin
stun al
then sai i produc the monei just draw me a glass of the
genuin stun if you pleas with a good head to it
the landlord look at me in return over the bar from head to foot
with a strang smile on hi face and instead of draw the beer
look round the screen and said someth to hi wife she came out
from behind it with her work in her hand and join him in survei
me here we stand all three befor me now the landlord in hi
shirtsleev lean against the bar windowfram hi wife look
over the littl halfdoor and i in some confus look up at them
from outsid the partit thei ask me a good mani question as
what my name wa how old i wa where i live how i wa emploi
and how i came there to all of which that i might commit nobodi i
invent i am afraid appropri answer thei serv me with the al
though i suspect it wa not the genuin stun and the landlord
wife open the littl halfdoor of the bar and bend down gave
me my monei back and gave me a kiss that wa half admir and half
compassion but all womanli and good i am sure
i know i do not exagger unconsci and unintention the
scanti of my resourc or the difficulti of my life i know that
if a shill were given me by mr quinion at ani time i spent it in
a dinner or a tea i know that i work from morn until night with
common men and boi a shabbi child i know that i loung about the
street insuffici and unsatisfactorili fed i know that but for
the merci of god i might easili have been for ani care that wa taken
of me a littl robber or a littl vagabond
yet i held some station at murdston and grinbi too besid that mr
quinion did what a careless man so occupi and deal with a thing so
anomal could to treat me as on upon a differ foot from the
rest i never said to man or boi how it wa that i came to be there
or gave the least indic of be sorri that i wa there that i
suffer in secret and that i suffer exquisit no on ever knew
but i how much i suffer it is as i have said alreadi utterli
beyond my power to tell but i kept my own counsel and i did my work
i knew from the first that if i could not do my work as well as ani
of the rest i could not hold myself abov slight and contempt i soon
becam at least as expediti and as skil as either of the other
boi though perfectli familiar with them my conduct and manner were
differ enough from their to place a space between us thei and
the men gener spoke of me as the littl gent or the young
suffolk a certain man name gregori who wa foreman of the packer
and anoth name tipp who wa the carman and wore a red jacket us
to address me sometim as david but i think it wa mostli when we
were veri confidenti and when i had made some effort to entertain
them over our work with some result of the old read which were
fast perish out of my remembr meali potato upros onc and
rebel against my be so distinguish but mick walker settl him
in no time
my rescu from thi kind of exist i consid quit hopeless and
abandon as such altogeth i am solemnli convinc that i never for
on hour wa reconcil to it or wa otherwis than miser unhappi
but i bore it and even to peggotti partli for the love of her and
partli for shame never in ani letter though mani pass between us
reveal the truth
mr micawb difficulti were an addit to the distress state of
my mind in my forlorn state i becam quit attach to the famili and

violent at the begin of on of these saturdai night convers

allow myself to be prevail upon to accept ani invit to eat and
drink with them out of their stock know that thei got on badli with
the butcher and baker and had often not too much for themselv
until mr micawb took me into her entir confid thi she did on
even as follow
master copperfield said mr micawb i make no stranger of you
and therefor do not hesit to sai that mr micawb difficulti
ar come to a crisi
it made me veri miser to hear it and i look at mr micawb
red ey with the utmost sympathi
with the except of the heel of a dutch cheesewhich is not adapt
to the want of a young familysaid mr micawb there is realli
not a scrap of anyth in the larder i wa accustom to speak of
the larder when i live with papa and mama and i us the word almost
unconsci what i mean to express is that there is noth to eat

clickettthi wa the girl from the workhouseb of a vulgar
mind would take pain liberti if so much confid wa repos in
her master copperfield if i might ask you
i understood mr micawb now and beg her to make us of me to ani
extent i began to dispos of the more portabl articl of properti
that veri even and went out on a similar expedit almost everi
morn befor i went to murdston and grinbi
mr micawb had a few book on a littl chiffoni which he call the
librari and those went first i carri them on after anoth to
a bookstal in the citi roadon part of which near our hous wa
almost all bookstal and bird shop thenand sold them for whatev

scold by hi wife everi morn more than onc when i went there
earli i had audienc of him in a turnup bedstead with a cut in hi
forehead or a black ey bear wit to hi excess overnight i
am afraid he wa quarrelsom in hi drink and he with a shake

pocket of hi cloth which lai upon the floor while hi wife with a
babi in her arm and her shoe down at heel never left off rate him
sometim he had lost hi monei and then he would ask me to call again

wa drunkand secretli complet the bargain on the stair as we went
down togeth at the pawnbrok shop too i began to be veri well
known the princip gentleman who offici behind the counter took
a good deal of notic of me and often got me i recollect to declin a
latin noun or adject or to conjug a latin verb in hi ear while
he transact my busi after all these occas mr micawb made
a littl treat which wa gener a supper and there wa a peculiar
relish in these meal which i well rememb
at last mr micawb difficulti came to a crisi and he wa
arrest earli on morn and carri over to the king bench prison
in the borough he told me as he went out of the hous that the god
of dai had now gone down upon himand i realli thought hi heart wa

beat heart
mr micawb wa wait for me within the gate and we went up to hi
room top stori but on and cri veri much he solemnli conjur me
i rememb to take warn by hi fate and to observ that if a man

nineteen shill and sixpenc he would be happi but that if he
spent twenti pound on he would be miser after which he borrow a
shill of me for porter gave me a written order on mr micawb for
the amount and put awai hi pockethandkerchief and cheer up

grate on on each side to prevent it burn too mani coal until
anoth debtor who share the room with mr micawb came in from the
bakehous with the loin of mutton which wa our jointstock repast
then i wa sent up to captain hopkin in the room overhead with mr
micawb compliment and i wa hi young friend and would captain
hopkin lend me a knife and fork
captain hopkin lent me the knife and fork with hi compliment to mr
micawb there wa a veri dirti ladi in hi littl room and two wan
girl hi daughter with shock head of hair i thought it wa better
to borrow captain hopkinss knife and fork than captain hopkinss comb
the captain himself wa in the last extrem of shabbi with larg
whisker and an old old brown greatcoat with no other coat below it
i saw hi bed roll up in a corner and what plate and dish and pot
he had on a shelf and i divin god know how that though the two
girl with the shock head of hair were captain hopkinss children the
dirti ladi wa not marri to captain hopkin my timid station on hi
threshold wa not occupi more than a coupl of minut at most but
i came down again with all thi in my knowledg as sure as the knife
and fork were in my hand
there wa someth gipsylik and agreeabl in the dinner after all
i took back captain hopkinss knife and fork earli in the afternoon
and went home to comfort mr micawb with an account of my visit
she faint when she saw me return and made a littl jug of egghot
afterward to consol us while we talk it over

saw daili in go to the warehous in come from it and in prowl
about the street at mealtim i led the same secretli unhappi life
but i led it in the same lone selfreli manner the onli chang
i am consciou of ar firstli that i had grown more shabbi and
secondli that i wa now reliev of much of the weight of mr and mr
micawb care for some rel or friend had engag to help them
at their present pass and thei live more comfort in the prison
than thei had live for a long while out of it i us to breakfast with
them now in virtu of some arrang of which i have forgotten
the detail i forget too at what hour the gate were open in the
morn admit of my go in but i know that i wa often up at six
oclock and that my favourit loungingplac in the interv wa old
london bridg where i wa wont to sit in on of the stone recess
watch the peopl go by or to look over the balustrad at the sun
shine in the water and light up the golden flame on the top of the
monument the orfl met me here sometim to be told some astonish
fiction respect the wharv and the tower of which i can sai no
more than that i hope i believ them myself in the even i us
to go back to the prison and walk up and down the parad with mr
micawb or plai casino with mr micawb and hear reminisc of
her papa and mama whether mr murdston knew where i wa i am unabl
to sai i never told them at murdston and grinbi
mr micawb affair although past their crisi were veri much
involv by reason of a certain deed of which i us to hear a great
deal and which i suppos now to have been some former composit
with hi creditor though i wa so far from be clear about it
then that i am consciou of have confound it with those demoniac
parchment which ar held to have onc upon a time obtain to a great
extent in germani at last thi document appear to be got out of the
wai somehow at all event it ceas to be the rockahead it had been
and mr micawb inform me that her famili had decid that mr
micawb should appli for hi releas under the insolv debtor act
which would set him free she expect in about six week
and then said mr micawb who wa present i have no doubt i
shall pleas heaven begin to be beforehand with the world and to live
in a perfectli new manner ifin short if anyth turn up
by wai of go in for anyth that might be on the card i call to
mind that mr micawb about thi time compos a petit to the
hous of common prai for an alter in the law of imprison
for debt i set down thi remembr here becaus it is an instanc to
myself of the manner in which i fit my old book to my alter life
and made stori for myself out of the street and out of men and
women and how some main point in the charact i shall unconsci
develop i suppos in write my life were gradual form all thi
while
there wa a club in the prison in which mr micawb as a gentleman
wa a great author mr micawb had state hi idea of thi petit
to the club and the club had strongli approv of the same wherefor
mr micawb who wa a thoroughli goodnatur man and as activ a
creatur about everyth but hi own affair as ever exist and never
so happi as when he wa busi about someth that could never be of ani
profit to him set to work at the petit invent it engross it
on an immens sheet of paper spread it out on a tabl and appoint a
time for all the club and all within the wall if thei chose to come
up to hi room and sign it
when i heard of thi approach ceremoni i wa so anxiou to see them
all come in on after anoth though i knew the greater part of
them alreadi and thei me that i got an hour leav of absenc from
murdston and grinbi and establish myself in a corner for that
purpos as mani of the princip member of the club as could be got
into the small room without fill it support mr micawb in front
of the petit while my old friend captain hopkin who had wash
himself to do honour to so solemn an occas station himself close
to it to read it to all who were unacquaint with it content the
door wa then thrown open and the gener popul began to come in
in a long file sever wait outsid while on enter affix hi
signatur and went out to everybodi in success captain hopkin
said have you read itnowould you like to hear it read if
he weakli show the least disposit to hear it captain hopkin in
a loud sonor voic gave him everi word of it the captain would
have read it twenti thousand time if twenti thousand peopl would have
heard him on by on i rememb a certain lusciou roll he gave to
such phrase as the peopl repres in parliament assembl
your petition therefor humbl approach your honour hous hi
graciou majesti unfortun subject as if the word were someth
real in hi mouth and delici to tast mr micawb meanwhil
listen with a littl of an author vaniti and contempl not
sever the spike on the opposit wall
as i walk to and fro daili between southwark and blackfriar and
loung about at mealtim in obscur street the stone of which
mai for anyth i know be worn at thi moment by my childish feet i
wonder how mani of these peopl were want in the crowd that us to
come file befor me in review again to the echo of captain hopkinss
voic when my thought go back now to that slow agoni of my youth i
wonder how much of the histori i invent for such peopl hang like a
mist of fanci over wellrememb fact when i tread the old ground
i do not wonder that i seem to see and piti go on befor me an
innoc romant boi make hi imagin world out of such strang
experi and sordid thing
chapter 12 like life on my own account no better i form a great resolut
in due time mr micawb petit wa ripe for hear and that
gentleman wa order to be discharg under the act to my great joi
hi creditor were not implac and mr micawb inform me that
even the reveng bootmak had declar in open court that he bore
him no malic but that when monei wa ow to him he like to be paid

some fee were to be settl and some formal observ befor he
could be actual releas the club receiv him with transport and
held an harmon meet that even in hi honour while mr micawb

mr micawb have now rais her voic into a perfect scream i
wa so frighten that i ran off to the clubroom and disturb mr
micawb in the act of presid at a long tabl and lead the choru
of
gee up dobbin
gee ho dobbin
gee up dobbin

with the tide that mr micawb wa in an alarm state upon
which he immedi burst into tear and came awai with me with hi

mr micawb wa so deepli affect by thi proof of her devot as
to me i wa dissolv in tear that he hung over her in a passion
manner implor her to look up and to be calm but the more he ask
mr micawb to look up the more she fix her ey on noth
and the more he ask her to compos herself the more she wouldnt
consequ mr micawb wa soon so overcom that he mingl hi
tear with her and mine until he beg me to do him the favour of
take a chair on the staircas while he got her into bed i would have
taken my leav for the night but he would not hear of my do that
until the stranger bell should ring so i sat at the staircas window
until he came out with anoth chair and join me
how is mr micawb now sir i said
veri low said mr micawb shake hi head reaction ah thi ha
been a dread dai we stand alon noweveryth is gone from us
mr micawb press my hand and groan and afterward shed tear
i wa greatli touch and disappoint too for i had expect that we
should be quit gai on thi happi and longlookedfor occas but mr
and mr micawb were so us to their old difficulti i think that
thei felt quit shipwreck when thei came to consid that thei were
releas from them all their elast wa depart and i never saw
them half so wretch as on thi night insomuch that when the bell
rang and mr micawb walk with me to the lodg and part from me
there with a bless i felt quit afraid to leav him by himself he
wa so profoundli miser
but through all the confus and low of spirit in which we had
been so unexpectedli to me involv i plainli discern that mr and
mr micawb and their famili were go awai from london and that a
part between us wa near at hand it wa in my walk home that night
and in the sleepless hour which follow when i lai in bed that the
thought first occur to methough i dont know how it came into my
headwhich afterward shape itself into a settl resolut
i had grown to be so accustom to the micawb and had been so
intim with them in their distress and wa so utterli friendless
without them that the prospect of be thrown upon some new shift for
a lodg and go onc more among unknown peopl wa like be that
moment turn adrift into my present life with such a knowledg of it
readi made as experi had given me all the sensit feel it
wound so cruelli all the shame and miseri it kept aliv within my
breast becam more poignant as i thought of thi and i determin that
the life wa unendur
that there wa no hope of escap from it unless the escap wa my own
act i knew quit well i rare heard from miss murdston and never
from mr murdston but two or three parcel of made or mend cloth
had come up for me consign to mr quinion and in each there wa
a scrap of paper to the effect that j m trust d c wa appli
himself to busi and devot himself wholli to hi dutiesnot the
least hint of my ever be anyth els than the common drudg into
which i wa fast settl down
the veri next dai show me while my mind wa in the first agit of
what it had conceiv that mr micawb had not spoken of their go
awai without warrant thei took a lodg in the hous where i live
for a week at the expir of which time thei were to start for
plymouth mr micawb himself came down to the countinghous in the
afternoon to tell mr quinion that he must relinquish me on the dai
of hi departur and to give me a high charact which i am sure i
deserv and mr quinion call in tipp the carman who wa a marri
man and had a room to let quarter me prospect on himbi our
mutual consent as he had everi reason to think for i said noth
though my resolut wa now taken
i pass my even with mr and mr micawb dure the remain
term of our resid under the same roof and i think we becam fonder
of on anoth as the time went on on the last sundai thei invit me
to dinner and we had a loin of pork and appl sauc and a pud i
had bought a spot wooden hors overnight as a part gift to littl
wilkin micawberthat wa the boyand a doll for littl emma i had
also bestow a shill on the orfl who wa about to be disband
we had a veri pleasant dai though we were all in a tender state about
our approach separ
i shall never master copperfield said mr micawb revert to the
period when mr micawb wa in difficulti without think of
you your conduct ha alwai been of the most delic and oblig
descript you have never been a lodger you have been a friend
my dear said mr micawb copperfield for so he had been
accustom to call me of late ha a heart to feel for the distress
of hi fellowcreatur when thei ar behind a cloud and a head to
plan and a hand toin short a gener abil to dispos of such
avail properti as could be made awai with

were go to lose on anoth
my dear young friend said mr micawb i am older than you a man
of some experi in life andand of some experi in short in
difficulti gener speak at present and until someth turn
up which i am i mai sai hourli expect i have noth to bestow
but advic still my advic is so far worth take thatin short that
i have never taken it myself and am theher mr micawb who had
been beam and smile all over hi head and face up to the present
moment check himself and frownedth miser wretch you behold

heaven forbid that i should disparag him take him for all in all we
neer shallin short make the acquaint probabl of anybodi els
possess at hi time of life the same leg for gaiter and abl to
read the same descript of print without spectacl but he appli
that maxim to our marriag my dear and that wa so far prematur
enter into in consequ that i never recov the expens mr
micawb look asid at mr micawb and ad not that i am sorri
for it quit the contrari my love after which he wa grave for a
minut or so
my other piec of advic copperfield said mr micawb you know

six result happi annual incom twenti pound annual expenditur
twenti pound ought and six result miseri the blossom is blight
the leaf is wither the god of dai goe down upon the dreari scene
andand in short you ar for ever floor as i am
to make hi exampl the more impress mr micawb drank a glass of
punch with an air of great enjoy and satisfact and whistl the
colleg hornpip
i did not fail to assur him that i would store these precept in my
mind though inde i had no need to do so for at the time thei
affect me visibl next morn i met the whole famili at the coach
offic and saw them with a desol heart take their place outsid
at the back
master copperfield said mr micawb god bless you i never can
forget all that you know and i never would if i could
copperfield said mr micawb farewel everi happi and
prosper if in the progress of revolv year i could persuad
myself that my blight destini had been a warn to you i should feel
that i had not occupi anoth man place in exist altogeth in
vain in case of anyth turn up of which i am rather confid
i shall be extrem happi if it should be in my power to improv your
prospect
i think as mr micawb sat at the back of the coach with the
children and i stood in the road look wistfulli at them a mist
clear from her ey and she saw what a littl creatur i realli wa
i think so becaus she beckon to me to climb up with quit a new and
motherli express in her face and put her arm round my neck and gave
me just such a kiss as she might have given to her own boi i had bare
time to get down again befor the coach start and i could hardli see
the famili for the handkerchief thei wave it wa gone in a minut
the orfl and i stood look vacantli at each other in the middl
of the road and then shook hand and said goodby she go back
i suppos to st luke workhous as i went to begin my weari dai at
murdston and grinbi
but with no intent of pass mani more weari dai there no i had
resolv to run awayto go by some mean or other down into the
countri to the onli relat i had in the world and tell my stori to
my aunt miss betsei i have alreadi observ that i dont know how thi
desper idea came into my brain but onc there it remain there
and harden into a purpos than which i have never entertain a more
determin purpos in my life i am far from sure that i believ there
wa anyth hope in it but my mind wa thoroughli made up that it
must be carri into execut
again and again and a hundr time again sinc the night when the
thought had first occur to me and banish sleep i had gone over
that old stori of my poor mother about my birth which it had been on
of my great delight in the old time to hear her tell and which i knew
by heart my aunt walk into that stori and walk out of it a dread
and aw personag but there wa on littl trait in her behaviour
which i like to dwell on and which gave me some faint shadow of
encourag i could not forget how my mother had thought that she
felt her touch her pretti hair with no ungentl hand and though it
might have been altogeth my mother fanci and might have had no
foundat whatev in fact i made a littl pictur out of it of my
terribl aunt relent toward the girlish beauti that i recollect so
well and love so much which soften the whole narr it is veri
possibl that it had been in my mind a long time and had gradual
engend my determin
as i did not even know where miss betsei live i wrote a long letter
to peggotti and ask her incident if she rememb pretend
that i had heard of such a ladi live at a certain place i name at
random and had a curios to know if it were the same in the cours
of that letter i told peggotti that i had a particular occas for
half a guinea and that if she could lend me that sum until i could
repai it i should be veri much oblig to her and would tell her
afterward what i had want it for
peggotti answer soon arriv and wa as usual full of affection
devot she enclos the half guinea i wa afraid she must have had
a world of troubl to get it out of mr barkiss box and told me that
miss betsei live near dover but whether at dover itself at hyth
sandgat or folkeston she could not sai on of our men howev
inform me on my ask him about these place that thei were all
close togeth i deem thi enough for my object and resolv to set
out at the end of that week
be a veri honest littl creatur and unwil to disgrac the
memori i wa go to leav behind me at murdston and grinbi i
consid myself bound to remain until saturdai night and as i had
been paid a week wage in advanc when i first came there not to
present myself in the countinghous at the usual hour to receiv my
stipend for thi express reason i had borrow the halfguinea that
i might not be without a fund for my travellingexpens accordingli
when the saturdai night came and we were all wait in the warehous
to be paid and tipp the carman who alwai took preced went in
first to draw hi monei i shook mick walker by the hand ask him
when it came to hi turn to be paid to sai to mr quinion that i had
gone to move my box to tipp and bid a last good night to meali

direct for it on the back of on of our address card that we nail
on the cask master david to be left till call for at the coach
offic dover thi i had in my pocket readi to put on the box after i
should have got it out of the hous and as i went toward my lodg
i look about me for someon who would help me to carri it to the
bookingoffic
there wa a longleg young man with a veri littl empti donkeycart
stand near the obelisk in the blackfriar road whose ey i caught
as i wa go by and who address me as sixpennorth of bad
hapenc hope i should know him agin to swear toin allus i
have no doubt to my stare at him i stop to assur him that i had
not done so in bad manner but uncertain whether he might or might not
like a job

i told him mine which wa down that street there and which i want
him to take to the dover coach offic for sixpenc
done with you for a tanner said the longleg young man and
directli got upon hi cart which wa noth but a larg wooden trai on
wheel and rattl awai at such a rate that it wa as much as i could
do to keep pace with the donkei
there wa a defiant manner about thi young man and particularli about
the wai in which he chew straw as he spoke to me that i did not much
like as the bargain wa made howev i took him upstair to the room
i wa leav and we brought the box down and put it on hi cart
now i wa unwil to put the directioncard on there lest ani of my
landlord famili should fathom what i wa do and detain me so
i said to the young man that i would be glad if he would stop for a
minut when he came to the deadwal of the king bench prison the
word were no sooner out of my mouth than he rattl awai as if he my
box the cart and the donkei were all equal mad and i wa quit out
of breath with run and call after him when i caught him at the
place appoint
be much flush and excit i tumbl my halfguinea out of my
pocket in pull the card out i put it in my mouth for safeti and
though my hand trembl a good deal had just ti the card on veri
much to my satisfact when i felt myself violent chuck under the
chin by the longleg young man and saw my halfguinea fly out of my
mouth into hi hand

between that anim and a magistr when he chang hi mind jump
into the cart sat upon my box and exclaim that he would drive to
the polli straight rattl awai harder than ever
i ran after him as fast as i could but i had no breath to call out
with and should not have dare to call out now if i had i narrowli
escap be run over twenti time at least in half a mile now i
lost him now i saw him now i lost him now i wa cut at with a whip
now shout at now down in the mud now up again now run into
somebodi arm now run headlong at a post at length confus by
fright and heat and doubt whether half london might not by thi time
be turn out for my apprehens i left the young man to go where
he would with my box and monei and pant and cry but never
stop face about for greenwich which i had understood wa on
the dover road take veri littl more out of the world toward the
retreat of my aunt miss betsei than i had brought into it on the
night when my arriv gave her so much umbrag
chapter 13 the sequel of my resolut
for anyth i know i mai have had some wild idea of run all the
wai to dover when i gave up the pursuit of the young man with the
donkeycart and start for greenwich my scatter sens were soon
collect as to that point if i had for i came to a stop in the kent
road at a terrac with a piec of water befor it and a great foolish
imag in the middl blow a dry shell here i sat down on a doorstep
quit spent and exhaust with the effort i had alreadi made and with
hardli breath enough to cry for the loss of my box and halfguinea
it wa by thi time dark i heard the clock strike ten as i sat
rest but it wa a summer night fortun and fine weather when
i had recov my breath and had got rid of a stifl sensat in
my throat i rose up and went on in the midst of my distress i had no
notion of go back i doubt if i should have had ani though there had
been a swiss snowdrift in the kent road
but my stand possess of onli threehalfp in the world and i
am sure i wonder how thei came to be left in my pocket on a saturdai
night troubl me none the less becaus i went on i began to pictur
to myself as a scrap of newspap intellig my be found dead in
a dai or two under some hedg and i trudg on miser though as
fast as i could until i happen to pass a littl shop where it wa
written up that ladi and gentlemen wardrob were bought and that
the best price wa given for rag bone and kitchenstuff the master
of thi shop wa sit at the door in hi shirtsleev smoke and
as there were a great mani coat and pair of trouser dangl from
the low ceil and onli two feebl candl burn insid to show
what thei were i fanci that he look like a man of a reveng
disposit who had hung all hi enemi and wa enjoi himself
my late experi with mr and mr micawb suggest to me that here
might be a mean of keep off the wolf for a littl while i went up
the next bystreet took off my waistcoat roll it neatli under my
arm and came back to the shop door
if you pleas sir i said i am to sell thi for a fair price
mr dollobydollobi wa the name over the shop door at leasttook the
waistcoat stood hi pipe on it head against the doorpost went into
the shop follow by me snuf the two candl with hi finger
spread the waistcoat on the counter and look at it there held it up
against the light and look at it there and ultim said
what do you call a price now for thi here littl weskit
oh you know best sir i return modestli

would eighteenp bei hint after some hesit
mr dollobi roll it up again and gave it me back i should rob my
famili he said if i wa to offer ninep for it
thi wa a disagre wai of put the busi becaus it impos
upon me a perfect stranger the unpleas of ask mr dollobi to
rob hi famili on my account my circumst be so veri press
howev i said i would take ninep for it if he pleas mr
dollobi not without some grumbl gave ninep i wish him good
night and walk out of the shop the richer by that sum and the
poorer by a waistcoat but when i button my jacket that wa not much
inde i foresaw pretti clearli that my jacket would go next and that
i should have to make the best of my wai to dover in a shirt and a pair
of trouser and might deem myself lucki if i got there even in that
trim but my mind did not run so much on thi as might be suppos
beyond a gener impress of the distanc befor me and of the young
man with the donkeycart have us me cruelli i think i had no
veri urgent sens of my difficulti when i onc again set off with my
ninep in my pocket
a plan had occur to me for pass the night which i wa go to
carri into execut thi wa to lie behind the wall at the back of my
old school in a corner where there us to be a haystack i imagin
it would be a kind of compani to have the boi and the bedroom where
i us to tell the stori so near me although the boi would know
noth of my be there and the bedroom would yield me no shelter
i had had a hard dai work and wa pretti well jade when i came
climb out at last upon the level of blackheath it cost me some
troubl to find out salem hous but i found it and i found a haystack
in the corner and i lai down by it have first walk round the wall
and look up at the window and seen that all wa dark and silent
within never shall i forget the lone sensat of first ly down
without a roof abov my head
sleep came upon me as it came on mani other outcast against whom
housedoor were lock and housedog bark that nightand i
dream of ly on my old schoolb talk to the boi in my room
and found myself sit upright with steerforth name upon my lip
look wildli at the star that were glisten and glimmer abov
me when i rememb where i wa at that untim hour a feel
stole upon me that made me get up afraid of i dont know what and walk
about but the fainter glimmer of the star and the pale light in
the sky where the dai wa come reassur me and my ey be veri
heavi i lai down again and sleptthough with a knowledg in my sleep
that it wa colduntil the warm beam of the sun and the ring of
the gettingup bell at salem hous awok me if i could have hope that
steerforth wa there i would have lurk about until he came out
alon but i knew he must have left long sinc traddl still remain
perhap but it wa veri doubt and i had not suffici confid
in hi discret or good luck howev strong my relianc wa on hi
good natur to wish to trust him with my situat so i crept awai
from the wall as mr creakl boi were get up and struck into the
long dusti track which i had first known to be the dover road when i wa
on of them and when i littl expect that ani ey would ever see me
the wayfar i wa now upon it

had met or overtaken i sought no shelter therefor but the sky and
toil into chathamwhich in that night aspect is a mere dream of
chalk and drawbridg and mastless ship in a muddi river roof

not reliev when an ugli old man with the lower part of hi face all

thirsti than i had ever been a littl befor sunset but at an expens
of threepenc i soon refresh myself complet and be in better
spirit then limp seven mile upon my road
my bed at night wa under anoth haystack where i rest comfort
after have wash my blister feet in a stream and dress them as
well as i wa abl with some cool leav when i took the road again
next morn i found that it lai through a success of hopground
and orchard it wa suffici late in the year for the orchard
to be ruddi with ripe appl and in a few place the hoppick were
alreadi at work i thought it all extrem beauti and made up
my mind to sleep among the hop that night imagin some cheer
companionship in the long perspect of pole with the grace
leav twine round them
the tramper were wors than ever that dai and inspir me with a
dread that is yet quit fresh in my mind some of them were most
ferociouslook ruffian who stare at me as i went by and stop
perhap and call after me to come back and speak to them and when i
took to my heel stone me i recollect on young fellowa tinker i
suppos from hi wallet and brazierwho had a woman with him and
who face about and stare at me thu and then roar to me in such a
tremend voic to come back that i halt and look round
come here when your call said the tinker or ill rip your
young bodi open

propiti the tinker by my look i observ that the woman had a black
ey

i almost fear he saw the monei in my pocket
sir i stammer

moment and toss it to the woman
the woman burst into a fit of laughter as if she thought thi a joke
and toss it back to me nod onc as slightli as befor and made
the word go with her lip befor i could obei howev the tinker
seiz the handkerchief out of my hand with a rough that threw me
awai like a feather and put it loos round hi own neck turn
upon the woman with an oath and knock her down i never shall forget
see her fall backward on the hard road and lie there with her bonnet
tumbl off and her hair all whiten in the dust nor when i look
back from a distanc see her sit on the pathwai which wa a
bank by the roadsid wipe the blood from her face with a corner of
her shawl while he went on ahead
thi adventur frighten me so that afterward when i saw ani of
these peopl come i turn back until i could find a hidingplac
where i remain until thei had gone out of sight which happen so
often that i wa veri serious delai but under thi difficulti as

peggotti she goe and get marri next becaus she ha not seen
enough of the evil attend such thing she goe and get marri
next as the child relat i onli hope said my aunt shake her
head that her husband is on of those poker husband who abound in the
newspap and will beat her well with on
i could not bear to hear my old nurs so decri and made the subject
of such a wish i told my aunt that inde she wa mistaken that
peggotti wa the best the truest the most faith most devot and
most selfdeni friend and servant in the world who had ever love
me dearli who had ever love my mother dearli who had held my mother
dy head upon her arm on whose face my mother had imprint her last
grate kiss and my remembr of them both choke me i broke down
as i wa try to sai that her home wa my home and that all she had
wa mine and that i would have gone to her for shelter but for her
humbl station which made me fear that i might bring some troubl on
heri broke down i sai as i wa try to sai so and laid my face in
my hand upon the tabl
well well said my aunt the child is right to stand by those who
have stood by himjanet donkei
i thoroughli believ that but for those unfortun donkei we should
have come to a good understand for my aunt had laid her hand on my
shoulder and the impuls wa upon me thu embolden to embrac her
and beseech her protect but the interrupt and the disord she
wa thrown into by the struggl outsid put an end to all softer idea
for the present and kept my aunt indignantli declaim to mr dick
about her determin to appeal for redress to the law of her
countri and to bring action for trespass against the whole donkei
proprietorship of dover until teatim
after tea we sat at the windowon the lookout as i imagin from
my aunt sharp express of face for more invadersuntil dusk when
janet set candl and a backgammonboard on the tabl and pull down
the blind

preval there and janet repli that she had been make tinder
down in the kitchen of my old shirt but there were no other cloth in
my room than the odd heap of thing i wore and when i wa left there
with a littl taper which my aunt forewarn me would burn exactli five
minut i heard them lock my door on the outsid turn these thing
over in my mind i deem it possibl that my aunt who could know
noth of me might suspect i had a habit of run awai and took
precaut on that account to have me in safe keep
the room wa a pleasant on at the top of the hous overlook the
sea on which the moon wa shine brilliantli after i had said my
prayer and the candl had burnt out i rememb how i still sat
look at the moonlight on the water as if i could hope to read my
fortun in it as in a bright book or to see my mother with her child
come from heaven along that shine path to look upon me as she had
look when i last saw her sweet face i rememb how the solemn feel
with which at length i turn my ey awai yield to the sensat of
gratitud and rest which the sight of the whitecurtain bedand how
much more the ly softli down upon it nestl in the snowwhit
sheetsinspir i rememb how i thought of all the solitari place
under the night sky where i had slept and how i prai that i never
might be houseless ani more and never might forget the houseless i
rememb how i seem to float then down the melancholi glori of that
track upon the sea awai into the world of dream
chapter 14 my aunt make up her mind about me

the breakfast tabl with her elbow on the trai that the content of

what do you think of him said my aunt
i had some shadowi idea of endeavour to evad the question by
repli that i thought him a veri nice gentleman but my aunt wa
not to be so put off for she laid her work down in her lap and said
fold her hand upon it
come your sister betsei trotwood would have told me what she thought
of anyon directli be as like your sister as you can and speak out
is hei mr dicki ask becaus i dont know aunti he at all out
of hi mind then i stammer for i felt i wa on danger ground
not a morsel said my aunt
oh inde i observ faintli
if there is anyth in the world said my aunt with great decis
and forc of manner that mr dick is not it that
i had noth better to offer than anoth timid oh inde
he ha been call mad said my aunt i have a selfish pleasur in
sai he ha been call mad or i should not have had the benefit of
hi societi and advic for these last ten year and upwardsin fact
ever sinc your sister betsei trotwood disappoint me
so long as that i said
and nice peopl thei were who had the audac to call him mad
pursu my aunt mr dick is a sort of distant connexion of mineit
doesnt matter how i neednt enter into that if it hadnt been for me
hi own brother would have shut him up for life that all
i am afraid it wa hypocrit in me but see that my aunt felt
strongli on the subject i tri to look as if i felt strongli too
a proud fool said my aunt becaus hi brother wa a littl
eccentricthough he is not half so eccentr as a good mani peopleh
didnt like to have him visibl about hi hous and sent him awai to
some privat asylumplac though he had been left to hi particular
care by their deceas father who thought him almost a natur and a
wise man he must have been to think so mad himself no doubt
again as my aunt look quit convinc i endeavour to look quit
convinc also
so i step in said my aunt and made him an offer i said your
brother sanea great deal more sane than you ar or ever will be it
is to be hope let him have hi littl incom and come and live with
me i am not afraid of him i am not proud i am readi to take care
of him and shall not illtreat him as some peopl besid the
asylumfolk have done after a good deal of squabbl said my
aunt i got him and he ha been here ever sinc he is the most
friendli and amen creatur in exist and as for advicebut
nobodi know what that man mind is except myself
my aunt smooth her dress and shook her head as if she smooth
defianc of the whole world out of the on and shook it out of the
other
he had a favourit sister said my aunt a good creatur and veri
kind to him but she did what thei all dotook a husband and he did
what thei all domad her wretch it had such an effect upon the mind
of mr dick that not mad i hope that combin with hi fear
of hi brother and hi sens of hi unkind it threw him into a
fever that wa befor he came to me but the recollect of it is
oppress to him even now did he sai anyth to you about king
charl the first child
ye aunt
ah said my aunt rub her nose as if she were a littl vex
that hi allegor wai of express it he connect hi ill
with great disturb and agit natur and that the figur
or the simil or whatev it call which he choos to us and why
shouldnt he if he think proper
i said certainli aunt
it not a businesslik wai of speak said my aunt nor a worldli
wai i am awar of that and that the reason why i insist upon it
that there shant be a word about it in hi memori
is it a memori about hi own histori that he is write aunt
ye child said my aunt rub her nose again he is memori
the lord chancellor or the lord somebodi or otheron of those peopl
at all event who ar paid to be memorializedabout hi affair i
suppos it will go in on of these dai he hasnt been abl to draw
it up yet without introduc that mode of express himself but it
dont signifi it keep him emploi
in fact i found out afterward that mr dick had been for upward
of ten year endeavour to keep king charl the first out of the
memori but he had been constantli get into it and wa there now
i sai again said my aunt nobodi know what that man mind is
except myself and he the most amen and friendli creatur in
exist if he like to fly a kite sometim what of that franklin
us to fly a kite he wa a quaker or someth of that sort if i
am not mistaken and a quaker fly a kite is a much more ridicul
object than anybodi els
if i could have suppos that my aunt had recount these particular
for my especi behoof and as a piec of confid in me i should
have felt veri much distinguish and should have augur favour
from such a mark of her good opinion but i could hardli help observ
that she had launch into them chiefli becaus the question wa rais
in her own mind and with veri littl refer to me though she had
address herself to me in the absenc of anybodi els
at the same time i must sai that the generos of her championship
of poor harmless mr dick not onli inspir my young breast with
some selfish hope for myself but warm it unselfishli toward her
i believ that i began to know that there wa someth about my aunt
notwithstand her mani eccentr and odd humour to be honour
and trust in though she wa just as sharp that dai as on the dai
befor and wa in and out about the donkei just as often and wa
thrown into a tremend state of indign when a young man go
by ogl janet at a window which wa on of the gravest misdemeanour
that could be commit against my aunt digniti she seem to me to
command more of my respect if not less of my fear
the anxieti i underw in the interv which necessarili elaps
befor a repli could be receiv to her letter to mr murdston wa
extrem but i made an endeavour to suppress it and to be as agreeabl
as i could in a quiet wai both to my aunt and mr dick the latter and
i would have gone out to fly the great kite but that i had still no
other cloth than the anyth but ornament garment with which i
had been decor on the first dai and which confin me to the hous
except for an hour after dark when my aunt for my health sake
parad me up and down on the cliff outsid befor go to bed at
length the repli from mr murdston came and my aunt inform me to my
infinit terror that he wa come to speak to her herself on the next
dai on the next dai still bundl up in my curiou habili i sat
count the time flush and heat by the conflict of sink hope
and rise fear within me and wait to be startl by the sight of
the gloomi face whose nonarriv startl me everi minut
my aunt wa a littl more imperi and stern than usual but i observ
no other token of her prepar herself to receiv the visitor so much
dread by me she sat at work in the window and i sat by with my
thought run astrai on all possibl and imposs result of mr
murdston visit until pretti late in the afternoon our dinner had
been indefinit postpon but it wa grow so late that my aunt
had order it to be got readi when she gave a sudden alarm of donkei
and to my constern and amaz i beheld miss murdston on a

window you have no busi there how dare you trespass go along
oh you boldfac thing
my aunt wa so exasper by the cool with which miss murdston

for the moment to dart out accord to custom i seiz the opportun
to inform her who it wa and that the gentleman now come near the

mr murdston himself
i dont care who it is cri my aunt still shake her head and
gesticul anyth but welcom from the bowwindow i wont be

lead him off and i saw from behind my aunt a sort of hurri
battlepiec in which the donkei stood resist everybodi with all
hi four leg plant differ wai while janet tri to pull him
round by the bridl mr murdston tri to lead him on miss murdston
struck at janet with a parasol and sever boi who had come to see

hi teen rush out to the scene of action pounc upon him captur

the ground into the garden and call upon janet to fetch the
constabl and justic that he might be taken tri and execut on
the spot held him at bai there thi part of the busi howev did
not last long for the young rascal be expert at a varieti of feint
and dodg of which my aunt had no concept soon went whoop awai

such thing

aunt face as she deliv herself of thi veri unexpect sentiment

no less than the matter wa so fieri that miss murdston without a

thu i began my new life in a new name and with everyth new about
me now that the state of doubt wa over i felt for mani dai
like on in a dream i never thought that i had a curiou coupl of
guardian in my aunt and mr dick i never thought of anyth about
myself distinctli the two thing clearest in my mind were that a
remot had come upon the old blunderston lifewhich seem to lie
in the haze of an immeasur distanc and that a curtain had for ever
fallen on my life at murdston and grinbi no on ha ever rais that
curtain sinc i have lift it for a moment even in thi narr
with a reluct hand and drop it gladli the remembr of that
life is fraught with so much pain to me with so much mental suffer
and want of hope that i have never had the courag even to examin how
long i wa doom to lead it whether it last for a year or more or
less i do not know i onli know that it wa and ceas to be and that
i have written and there i leav it
chapter 15 i make anoth begin
mr dick and i soon becam the best of friend and veri often when hi
dai work wa done went out togeth to fly the great kite everi dai
of hi life he had a long sit at the memori which never made the
least progress howev hard he labour for king charl the first
alwai strai into it sooner or later and then it wa thrown asid
and anoth on begun the patienc and hope with which he bore these
perpetu disappoint the mild percept he had that there wa
someth wrong about king charl the first the feebl effort he made
to keep him out and the certainti with which he came in and tumbl
the memori out of all shape made a deep impress on me what mr
dick suppos would come of the memori if it were complet where he
thought it wa to go or what he thought it wa to do he knew no more
than anybodi els i believ nor wa it at all necessari that he should
troubl himself with such question for if anyth were certain under
the sun it wa certain that the memori never would be finish it
wa quit an affect sight i us to think to see him with the kite
when it wa up a great height in the air what he had told me in hi
room about hi belief in it dissemin the statement past on it
which were noth but old leav of abort memori might have been
a fanci with him sometim but not when he wa out look up at
the kite in the sky and feel it pull and tug at hi hand he never
look so seren as he did then i us to fanci as i sat by him of an
even on a green slope and saw him watch the kite high in the quiet
air that it lift hi mind out of it confus and bore it such wa
my boyish thought into the ski as he wound the string in and it came
lower and lower down out of the beauti light until it flutter to
the ground and lai there like a dead thing he seem to wake gradual
out of a dream and i rememb to have seen him take it up and look
about him in a lost wai as if thei had both come down togeth so that
i piti him with all my heart
while i advanc in friendship and intimaci with mr dick i did not
go backward in the favour of hi staunch friend my aunt she took
so kindli to me that in the cours of a few week she shorten my
adopt name of trotwood into trot and even encourag me to hope that
if i went on as i had begun i might take equal rank in her affect
with my sister betsei trotwood

which at hi earnest petit were afterward increas to ten we
part at the gardeng in a most affection manner and mr dick
did not go into the hous until my aunt had driven me out of sight of

my aunt who wa perfectli indiffer to public opinion drove the grei
poni through dover in a masterli manner sit high and stiff like
a state coachman keep a steadi ey upon him wherev he went and
make a point of not let him have hi own wai in ani respect when

beam with carv head on the end bulg out too so that i fanci

ground floor in a littl round tower that form on side of the
hous and quickli disappear the low arch door then open and
the face came out it wa quit as cadaver as it had look in the

then come and see my littl housekeep said mr wickfield
we accordingli went up a wonder old staircas with a balustrad
so broad that we might have gone up that almost as easili and into
a shadi old drawingroom light by some three or four of the quaint
window i had look up at from the street which had old oak seat
in them that seem to have come of the same tree as the shine oak
floor and the great beam in the ceil it wa a prettili furnish
room with a piano and some live furnitur in red and green and some
flower it seem to be all old nook and corner and in everi nook
and corner there wa some queer littl tabl or cupboard or bookcas
or seat or someth or other that made me think there wa not such
anoth good corner in the room until i look at the next on and
found it equal to it if not better on everyth there wa the same
air of retir and cleanli that mark the hous outsid
mr wickfield tap at a door in a corner of the panel wall and a
girl of about my own ag came quickli out and kiss him on her face
i saw immedi the placid and sweet express of the ladi whose
pictur had look at me downstair it seem to my imagin as
if the portrait had grown womanli and the origin remain a child
although her face wa quit bright and happi there wa a tranquil
about it and about hera quiet good calm spiritthat i never have
forgotten that i shall never forget thi wa hi littl housekeep
hi daughter agn mr wickfield said when i heard how he said it and
saw how he held her hand i guess what the on motiv of hi life wa
she had a littl baskettrifl hang at her side with kei in it and
she look as staid and as discreet a housekeep as the old hous
could have she listen to her father as he told her about me with a
pleasant face and when he had conclud propos to my aunt that we
should go upstair and see my room we all went togeth she befor us
and a gloriou old room it wa with more oak beam and diamond pane
and the broad balustrad go all the wai up to it
i cannot call to mind where or when in my childhood i had seen a
stain glass window in a church nor do i recollect it subject but
i know that when i saw her turn round in the grave light of the old
staircas and wait for us abov i thought of that window and i
associ someth of it tranquil bright with agn wickfield
ever afterward
my aunt wa as happi as i wa in the arrang made for me and we
went down to the drawingroom again well pleas and gratifi as she
would not hear of stai to dinner lest she should by ani chanc fail
to arriv at home with the grei poni befor dark and as i apprehend mr
wickfield knew her too well to argu ani point with her some lunch wa
provid for her there and agn went back to her gover and mr
wickfield to hi offic so we were left to take leav of on anoth
without ani restraint
she told me that everyth would be arrang for me by mr wickfield
and that i should want for noth and gave me the kindest word and
the best advic

mr dick and heaven be with you
i wa greatli overcom and could onli thank her again and again and
send my love to mr dick
never said my aunt be mean in anyth never be fals never be
cruel avoid those three vice trot and i can alwai be hope of
you
i promis as well as i could that i would not abus her kind or
forget her admonit
the poni at the door said my aunt and i am off stai here with
these word she embrac me hastili and went out of the room shut
the door after her at first i wa startl by so abrupt a departur
and almost fear i had displeas her but when i look into the
street and saw how dejectedli she got into the chais and drove awai
without look up i understood her better and did not do her that
injustic
by five oclock which wa mr wickfield dinnerhour i had muster
up my spirit again and wa readi for my knife and fork the cloth wa
onli laid for us two but agn wa wait in the drawingroom befor
dinner went down with her father and sat opposit to him at tabl i
doubt whether he could have dine without her
we did not stai there after dinner but came upstair into the
drawingroom again in on snug corner of which agn set glass for
her father and a decant of port wine i thought he would have miss
it usual flavour if it had been put there for him by ani other hand
there he sat take hi wine and take a good deal of it for two
hour while agn plai on the piano work and talk to him and
me he wa for the most part gai and cheer with us but sometim
hi ey rest on her and he fell into a brood state and wa
silent she alwai observ thi quickli i thought and alwai rous
him with a question or caress then he came out of hi medit and
drank more wine
agn made the tea and presid over it and the time pass awai after
it as after dinner until she went to bed when her father took her
in hi arm and kiss her and she be gone order candl in hi
offic then i went to bed too
but in the cours of the even i had rambl down to the door and a
littl wai along the street that i might have anoth peep at the old
hous and the grei cathedr and might think of my come through
that old citi on my journei and of my pass the veri hous i live
in without know it as i came back i saw uriah heep shut up
the offic and feel friendli toward everybodi went in and spoke
to him and at part gave him my hand but oh what a clammi hand hi
wa as ghostli to the touch as to the sight i rub mine afterward
to warm it and to rub hi off
it wa such an uncomfort hand that when i went to my room it wa
still cold and wet upon my memori lean out of the window and see
on of the face on the beamend look at me sidewai i fanci it
wa uriah heep got up there somehow and shut him out in a hurri
chapter 16 i am a new boi in more sens than on
next morn after breakfast i enter on school life again i went
accompani by mr wickfield to the scene of my futur studiesa grave
build in a courtyard with a learn air about it that seem veri
well suit to the strai rook and jackdaw who came down from the
cathedr tower to walk with a clerkli bear on the grassplotand
wa introduc to my new master doctor strong
doctor strong look almost as rusti to my think as the tall iron
rail and gate outsid the hous and almost as stiff and heavi as the
great stone urn that flank them and were set up on the top of
the redbrick wall at regular distanc all round the court like
sublim skittl for time to plai at he wa in hi librari i mean
doctor strong wa with hi cloth not particularli well brush and
hi hair not particularli well comb hi kneesmal unbrac hi
long black gaiter unbutton and hi shoe yawn like two cavern on
the hearthrug turn upon me a lustreless ey that remind me of
a longforgotten blind old hors who onc us to crop the grass and
tumbl over the grave in blunderston churchyard he said he wa glad
to see me and then he gave me hi hand which i didnt know what to do
with as it did noth for itself
but sit at work not far from doctor strong wa a veri pretti
young ladywhom he call anni and who wa hi daughter i
supposedwho got me out of my difficulti by kneel down to put doctor
strong shoe on and button hi gaiter which she did with great
cheer and quick when she had finish and we were go
out to the schoolroom i wa much surpris to hear mr wickfield
in bid her good morn address her as mr strong and i wa
wonder could she be doctor strong son wife or could she be mr
doctor strong when doctor strong himself unconsci enlighten me
by the by wickfield he said stop in a passag with hi hand on
my shoulder you have not found ani suitabl provis for my wife
cousin yet
no said mr wickfield no not yet
i could wish it done as soon as it can be done wickfield said
doctor strong for jack maldon is needi and idl and of those two
bad thing wors thing sometim come what doe doctor watt sai he

power thi centuri or two no mischief

doctor strong rub hi chin thoughtfulli
perhap not said mr wickfield and you bring me back to the
question with an apolog for digress no i have not been abl
to dispos of mr jack maldon yet i believ he said thi with some
hesit i penetr your motiv and it make the thing more
difficult
my motiv return doctor strong is to make some suitabl provis
for a cousin and an old playfellow of anni
ye i know said mr wickfield at home or abroad
ay repli the doctor appar wonder why he emphas those
word so much at home or abroad

on or other have you no choic ask mr wickfield
no return the doctor
no with astonish
not the least
no motiv said mr wickfield for mean abroad and not at home
no return the doctor
i am bound to believ you and of cours i do believ you said mr
wickfield it might have simplifi my offic veri much if i had known
it befor but i confess i entertain anoth impress
doctor strong regard him with a puzzl and doubt look
which almost immedi subsid into a smile that gave me great
encourag for it wa full of amiabl and sweet and there
wa a simplic in it and inde in hi whole manner when the
studiou ponder frost upon it wa got through veri attract and
hope to a young scholar like me repeat no and not the least
and other short assur to the same purport doctor strong jog
on befor us at a queer uneven pace and we follow mr wickfield
look grave i observ and shake hi head to himself without
know that i saw him
the schoolroom wa a pretti larg hall on the quietest side of the
hous confront by the state stare of some halfdozen of the great
urn and command a peep of an old seclud garden belong to the
doctor where the peach were ripen on the sunni south wall there
were two great alo in tub on the turf outsid the window the
broad hard leav of which plant look as if thei were made of
paint tin have ever sinc by associ been symbol to me
of silenc and retir about fiveandtwenti boi were studious
engag at their book when we went in but thei rose to give the doctor
good morn and remain stand when thei saw mr wickfield and me
a new boi young gentlemen said the doctor trotwood copperfield
on adam who wa the headboi then step out of hi place and
welcom me he look like a young clergyman in hi white cravat but
he wa veri affabl and goodhumour and he show me my place and
present me to the master in a gentlemanli wai that would have put me
at my eas if anyth could
it seem to me so long howev sinc i had been among such boi
or among ani companion of my own ag except mick walker and meali
potato that i felt as strang as ever i have done in my life i wa
so consciou of have pass through scene of which thei could have
no knowledg and of have acquir experi foreign to my ag
appear and condit as on of them that i half believ it wa an
impostur to come there as an ordinari littl schoolboi i had becom
in the murdston and grinbi time howev short or long it mai have
been so unus to the sport and game of boi that i knew i wa
awkward and inexperienc in the commonest thing belong to them
whatev i had learnt had so slip awai from me in the sordid care
of my life from dai to night that now when i wa examin about what
i knew i knew noth and wa put into the lowest form of the school
but troubl as i wa by my want of boyish skill and of booklearn
too i wa made infinit more uncomfort by the consider
that in what i did know i wa much farther remov from my companion
than in what i did not my mind ran upon what thei would think if thei
knew of my familiar acquaint with the king bench prison wa there
anyth about me which would reveal my proceed in connexion with
the micawb familyal those pawn and sell and suppersin
spite of myself suppos some of the boi had seen me come through
canterburi wayworn and rag and should find me out what would thei
sai who made so light of monei if thei could know how i had scrape my
halfpenc togeth for the purchas of my daili saveloi and beer or
my slice of pud how would it affect them who were so innoc of
london life and london street to discov how know i wa and wa
asham to be in some of the meanest phase of both all thi ran in
my head so much on that first dai at doctor strong that i felt
distrust of my slightest look and gestur shrunk within myself
whensoev i wa approach by on of my new schoolfellow and hurri
off the minut school wa over afraid of commit myself in my
respons to ani friendli notic or advanc
but there wa such an influenc in mr wickfield old hous that when
i knock at it with my new schoolbook under my arm i began to feel
my uneasi soften awai as i went up to my airi old room the

that he had launch mr peggotti hous on a pirat expedit

practic under which diabol ensign he wa carri me and littl
emli to the spanish main to be drown
i got a littl the better of my uneasi when i went to school
next dai and a good deal the better next dai and so shook it off by
degre that in less than a fortnight i wa quit at home and happi
among my new companion i wa awkward enough in their game and
backward enough in their studi but custom would improv me in the
first respect i hope and hard work in the second accordingli i
went to work veri hard both in plai and in earnest and gain great
commend and in a veri littl while the murdston and grinbi life
becam so strang to me that i hardli believ in it while my present
life grew so familiar that i seem to have been lead it a long
time
doctor strong wa an excel school as differ from mr creakl
as good is from evil it wa veri grave and decor order and
on a sound system with an appeal in everyth to the honour and good
faith of the boi and an avow intent to reli on their possess
of those qualiti unless thei prove themselv unworthi of it which
work wonder we all felt that we had a part in the manag of
the place and in sustain it charact and digniti henc we soon
becam warmli attach to iti am sure i did for on and i never knew
in all my time of ani other boi be otherwiseand learnt with a good
will desir to do it credit we had nobl game out of hour and
plenti of liberti but even then as i rememb we were well spoken of
in the town and rare did ani disgrac by our appear or manner
to the reput of doctor strong and doctor strong boi
some of the higher scholar board in the doctor hous and through
them i learn at second hand some particular of the doctor
historya how he had not yet been marri twelv month to the
beauti young ladi i had seen in the studi whom he had marri for
love for she had not a sixpenc and had a world of poor relat so
our fellow said readi to swarm the doctor out of hous and home also
how the doctor cogit manner wa attribut to hi be alwai
engag in look out for greek root which in my innoc and
ignor i suppos to be a botan furor on the doctor part
especi as he alwai look at the ground when he walk about
until i understood that thei were root of word with a view to a new
dictionari which he had in contempl adam our headboi who had
a turn for mathemat had made a calcul i wa inform of the
time thi dictionari would take in complet on the doctor plan and
at the doctor rate of go he consid that it might be done
in on thousand six hundr and fortynin year count from the
doctor last or sixtysecond birthdai
but the doctor himself wa the idol of the whole school and it must
have been a badli compos school if he had been anyth els for
he wa the kindest of men with a simpl faith in him that might have
touch the stone heart of the veri urn upon the wall as he walk up
and down that part of the courtyard which wa at the side of the hous
with the strai rook and jackdaw look after him with their head
cock slyli as if thei knew how much more know thei were in worldli
affair than he if ani sort of vagabond could onli get near enough to
hi creak shoe to attract hi attent to on sentenc of a tale
of distress that vagabond wa made for the next two dai it wa so
notori in the hous that the master and headboi took pain to cut
these maraud off at angl and to get out of window and turn them
out of the courtyard befor thei could make the doctor awar of their
presenc which wa sometim happili effect within a few yard of
him without hi know anyth of the matter as he jog to and
fro outsid hi own domain and unprotect he wa a veri sheep for
the shearer he would have taken hi gaiter off hi leg to give
awai in fact there wa a stori current among us i have no idea and
never had on what author but i have believ it for so mani
year that i feel quit certain it is true that on a frosti dai on
wintertim he actual did bestow hi gaiter on a beggarwoman who
occas some scandal in the neighbourhood by exhibit a fine infant
from door to door wrap in those garment which were univers
recogn be as well known in the vicin as the cathedr the
legend ad that the onli person who did not identifi them wa the
doctor himself who when thei were shortli afterward displai at the
door of a littl secondhand shop of no veri good reput where such
thing were taken in exchang for gin wa more than onc observ to
handl them approvingli as if admir some curiou novelti in the
pattern and consid them an improv on hi own
it wa veri pleasant to see the doctor with hi pretti young wife he
had a fatherli benign wai of show hi fond for her which
seem in itself to express a good man i often saw them walk in the
garden where the peach were and i sometim had a nearer observ
of them in the studi or the parlour she appear to me to take great
care of the doctor and to like him veri much though i never thought
her vital interest in the dictionari some cumbrou fragment of
which work the doctor alwai carri in hi pocket and in the line
of hi hat and gener seem to be expound to her as thei walk
about
i saw a good deal of mr strong both becaus she had taken a like
for me on the morn of my introduct to the doctor and wa alwai
afterward kind to me and interest in me and becaus she wa veri
fond of agn and wa often backward and forward at our hous there
wa a curiou constraint between her and mr wickfield i thought of
whom she seem to be afraid that never wore off when she came there
of an even she alwai shrunk from accept hi escort home and ran
awai with me instead and sometim as we were run gaili across
the cathedr yard togeth expect to meet nobodi we would meet mr
jack maldon who wa alwai surpris to see us
mr strong mama wa a ladi i took great delight in her name wa mr
markleham but our boi us to call her the old soldier on account of
her generalship and the skill with which she marshal great forc
of relat against the doctor she wa a littl sharpei woman
who us to wear when she wa dress on unchang cap ornament
with some artifici flower and two artifici butterfli suppos
to be hover abov the flower there wa a superstit among us
that thi cap had come from franc and could onli origin in the
workmanship of that ingeni nation but all i certainli know about it
is that it alwai made it appear of an even wheresoev mr
markleham made her appear that it wa carri about to friendli
meet in a hindoo basket that the butterfli had the gift of
trembl constantli and that thei improv the shine hour at doctor

consent that india wa quit a misrepres countri and had noth
objection in it but a tiger or two and a littl heat in the warm
part of the dai for my own part i look on mr jack maldon as a
modern sindbad and pictur him the bosom friend of all the rajah in
the east sit under canopi smoke curli golden pipesa mile
long if thei could be straighten out
mr strong wa a veri pretti singer as i knew who often heard her
sing by herself but whether she wa afraid of sing befor
peopl or wa out of voic that even it wa certain that she
couldnt sing at all she tri a duet onc with her cousin maldon
but could not so much as begin and afterward when she tri to sing
by herself although she began sweetli her voic di awai on a sudden
and left her quit distress with her head hang down over the kei
the good doctor said she wa nervou and to reliev her propos a
round game at card of which he knew as much as of the art of plai
the trombon but i remark that the old soldier took him into custodi
directli for her partner and instruct him as the first preliminari
of initi to give her all the silver he had in hi pocket
we had a merri game not made the less merri by the doctor mistak
of which he commit an innumer quantiti in spite of the

bent over him and i thought her finger trembl as she point out

that she wa in hi confid that night and as she turn again
toward him after glanc at me as i left the room and went out at the
door i saw her cross her hand upon hi knee and look up at him with
the same face someth quiet as he resum hi read

chapter 17 somebodi turn up
it ha not occur to me to mention peggotti sinc i ran awai but of
cours i wrote her a letter almost as soon as i wa hous at dover
and anoth and a longer letter contain all particular fulli
relat when my aunt took me formal under her protect on my be
settl at doctor strong i wrote to her again detail my happi
condit and prospect i never could have deriv anyth like the
pleasur from spend the monei mr dick had given me that i felt in
send a gold halfguinea to peggotti per post enclos in thi last
letter to discharg the sum i had borrow of her in which epistl
not befor i mention about the young man with the donkeycart
to these commun peggotti repli as promptli if not as
concis as a merchant clerk her utmost power of express which
were certainli not great in ink were exhaust in the attempt to write
what she felt on the subject of my journei four side of incoher and
interject begin of sentenc that had no end except blot
were inadequ to afford her ani relief but the blot were more
express to me than the best composit for thei show me that
peggotti had been cry all over the paper and what could i have
desir more
i made out without much difficulti that she could not take quit
kindli to my aunt yet the notic wa too short after so long a
prepossess the other wai we never knew a person she wrote but to
think that miss betsei should seem to be so differ from what she had
been thought to be wa a moralthat wa her word she wa evid
still afraid of miss betsei for she sent her grate duti to her but
timidli and she wa evid afraid of me too and entertain the
probabl of my run awai again soon if i might judg from the
repeat hint she threw out that the coachfar to yarmouth wa alwai
to be had of her for the ask
she gave me on piec of intellig which affect me veri much
name that there had been a sale of the furnitur at our old home and
that mr and miss murdston were gone awai and the hous wa shut up
to be let or sold god know i had no part in it while thei remain
there but it pain me to think of the dear old place as altogeth
abandon of the weed grow tall in the garden and the fallen
leav ly thick and wet upon the path i imagin how the wind
of winter would howl round it how the cold rain would beat upon the
windowglass how the moon would make ghost on the wall of the empti
room watch their solitud all night i thought afresh of the grave
in the churchyard underneath the tree and it seem as if the hous
were dead too now and all connect with my father and mother were
fade awai
there wa no other new in peggotti letter mr barki wa an
excel husband she said though still a littl near but we all had
our fault and she had plenti though i am sure i dont know what thei
were and he sent hi duti and my littl bedroom wa alwai readi for
me mr peggotti wa well and ham wa well and mr gummidg wa but
poorli and littl emli wouldnt send her love but said that peggotti
might send it if she like
all thi intellig i dutifulli impart to my aunt onli reserv
to myself the mention of littl emli to whom i instinct felt
that she would not veri tenderli inclin while i wa yet new at doctor
strong she made sever excurs over to canterburi to see me and
alwai at unseason hour with the view i suppos of take me by
surpris but find me well emploi and bear a good charact
and hear on all hand that i rose fast in the school she soon
discontinu these visit i saw her on a saturdai everi third or
fourth week when i went over to dover for a treat and i saw mr dick

on these occas mr dick never travel without a leathern
writingdesk contain a suppli of stationeri and the memori in
relat to which document he had a notion that time wa begin to
press now and that it realli must be got out of hand
mr dick wa veri partial to gingerbread to render hi visit the more
agreeabl my aunt had instruct me to open a credit for him at a cake
shop which wa hamper with the stipul that he should not be
serv with more than on shillingsworth in the cours of ani on dai
thi and the refer of all hi littl bill at the counti inn where
he slept to my aunt befor thei were paid induc me to suspect that
he wa onli allow to rattl hi monei and not to spend it i found
on further investig that thi wa so or at least there wa an
agreement between him and my aunt that he should account to her for
all hi disburs as he had no idea of deceiv her and alwai
desir to pleas her he wa thu made chari of launch into expens
on thi point as well as on all other possibl point mr dick wa
convinc that my aunt wa the wisest and most wonder of women as he
repeatedli told me with infinit secreci and alwai in a whisper
trotwood said mr dick with an air of mysteri after impart thi
confid to me on wednesdai who the man that hide near our
hous and frighten her

mr dick nod i thought noth would have frighten her he said
for she here he whisper softli dont mention itth wisest
and most wonder of women have said which he drew back to
observ the effect which thi descript of her made upon me
the first time he came said mr dick waslet me seesixteen
hundr and fortynin wa the date of king charless execut i think
you said sixteen hundr and fortynin
ye sir
i dont know how it can be said mr dick sore puzzl and shake
hi head i dont think i am as old as that
wa it in that year that the man appear sir i ask
why realli said mr dick i dont see how it can have been in that
year trotwood did you get that date out of histori
ye sir
i suppos histori never li doe it said mr dick with a gleam of
hope
oh dear no sir i repli most decis i wa ingenu and
young and i thought so
i cant make it out said mr dick shake hi head there
someth wrong somewher howev it wa veri soon after the mistak
wa made of put some of the troubl out of king charless head into
my head that the man first came i wa walk out with miss trotwood
after tea just at dark and there he wa close to our hous
walk about i inquir
walk about repeat mr dick let me see i must recollect a bit
nno no he wa not walk about
i ask as the shortest wai to get at it what he wa do
well he wasnt there at all said mr dick until he came up behind
her and whisper then she turn round and faint and i stood still
and look at him and he walk awai but that he should have
been hide ever sinc in the ground or somewher is the most
extraordinari thing
ha he been hide ever sinc i ask
to be sure he ha retort mr dick nod hi head grave never
came out till last night we were walk last night and he came up
behind her again and i knew him again
and did he frighten my aunt again
all of a shiver said mr dick counterfeit that affect and
make hi teeth chatter held by the pale cri but trotwood
come here get me close to him that he might whisper veri softli
why did she give him monei boi in the moonlight
he wa a beggar perhap
mr dick shook hi head as utterli renounc the suggest and
have repli a great mani time and with great confid no
beggar no beggar no beggar sir went on to sai that from hi window
he had afterward and late at night seen my aunt give thi person
monei outsid the garden rail in the moonlight who then slunk
awayinto the ground again as he thought probableand wa seen no
more while my aunt came hurriedli and secretli back into the hous and
had even that morn been quit differ from her usual self which
prei on mr dick mind
i had not the least belief in the outset of thi stori that the
unknown wa anyth but a delus of mr dick and on of the line
of that illfat princ who occas him so much difficulti but
after some reflect i began to entertain the question whether an
attempt or threat of an attempt might have been twice made to take
poor mr dick himself from under my aunt protect and whether
my aunt the strength of whose kind feel toward him i knew from
herself might have been induc to pai a price for hi peac and quiet
as i wa alreadi much attach to mr dick and veri solicit for hi
welfar my fear favour thi supposit and for a long time hi
wednesdai hardli ever came round without my entertain a misgiv
that he would not be on the coachbox as usual there he alwai
appear howev greyhead laugh and happi and he never had
anyth more to tell of the man who could frighten my aunt
these wednesdai were the happiest dai of mr dick life thei were
far from be the least happi of mine he soon becam known to everi
boi in the school and though he never took an activ part in ani game
but kitefli wa as deepli interest in all our sport as anyon
among us how often have i seen him intent upon a match at marbl
or pegtop look on with a face of unutter interest and hardli
breath at the critic time how often at hare and hound have
i seen him mount on a littl knoll cheer the whole field on
to action and wave hi hat abov hi grei head oblivi of king
charl the martyr head and all belong to it how mani a
summer hour have i known to be but bliss minut to him in
the cricketfield how mani winter dai have i seen him stand
bluenos in the snow and east wind look at the boi go down
the long slide and clap hi worst glove in raptur
he wa an univers favourit and hi ingenu in littl thing wa
transcend he could cut orang into such devic as none of us had
an idea of he could make a boat out of anyth from a skewer upward
he could turn crampbon into chessmen fashion roman chariot from old
court card make spoke wheel out of cotton reel and birdcag of
old wire but he wa greatest of all perhap in the articl of string
and straw with which we were all persuad he could do anyth that
could be done by hand
mr dick renown wa not long confin to us after a few wednesdai
doctor strong himself made some inquiri of me about him and i told
him all my aunt had told me which interest the doctor so much that
he request on the occas of hi next visit to be present to him
thi ceremoni i perform and the doctor beg mr dick whensoev
he should not find me at the coach offic to come on there and rest
himself until our morn work wa over it soon pass into a custom
for mr dick to come on as a matter of cours and if we were a littl
late as often happen on a wednesdai to walk about the courtyard
wait for me here he made the acquaint of the doctor beauti
young wife paler than formerli all thi time more rare seen by
me or anyon i think and not so gai but not less beauti and so
becam more and more familiar by degre until at last he would come
into the school and wait he alwai sat in a particular corner on a
particular stool which wa call dick after him here he would sit
with hi grei head bent forward attent listen to whatev might
be go on with a profound vener for the learn he had never
been abl to acquir
thi vener mr dick extend to the doctor whom he thought the
most subtl and accomplish philosoph of ani ag it wa long befor
mr dick ever spoke to him otherwis than barehead and even when he
and the doctor had struck up quit a friendship and would walk togeth
by the hour on that side of the courtyard which wa known among us as
the doctor walk mr dick would pull off hi hat at interv to show
hi respect for wisdom and knowledg how it ever came about that the
doctor began to read out scrap of the famou dictionari in these
walk i never knew perhap he felt it all the same at first as
read to himself howev it pass into a custom too and mr dick
listen with a face shine with pride and pleasur in hi heart of
heart believ the dictionari to be the most delight book in the
world
as i think of them go up and down befor those schoolroom
windowsth doctor read with hi complac smile an occasion
flourish of the manuscript or grave motion of hi head and mr dick
listen enchain by interest with hi poor wit calmli wander
god know where upon the wing of hard wordsi think of it as on of
the pleasantest thing in a quiet wai that i have ever seen i feel

for give her son a kiss observ that lowli as thei were thei
had their natur affect which thei hope would give no offenc to
anyon it wa a perfectli decent room half parlour and half kitchen
but not at all a snug room the teath were set upon the tabl and
the kettl wa boil on the hob there wa a chest of drawer with an
escritoir top for uriah to read or write at of an even there wa
uriah blue bag ly down and vomit paper there wa a compani of
uriah book command by mr tidd there wa a corner cupboard and
there were the usual articl of furnitur i dont rememb that ani
individu object had a bare pinch spare look but i do rememb
that the whole place had
it wa perhap a part of mr heep humil that she still wore
weed notwithstand the laps of time that had occur sinc mr
heep deceas she still wore weed i think there wa some compromis
in the cap but otherwis she wa as weedi as in the earli dai of her
mourn
thi is a dai to be rememb my uriah i am sure said mr heep
make the tea when master copperfield pai us a visit
i said youd think so mother said uriah

gradual got opposit to me and that thei respectfulli pli me

particularli choic there to be sure but i took the will for the deed
and felt that thei were veri attent present thei began to talk
about aunt and then i told them about mine and about father and
mother and then i told them about mine and then mr heep began to
talk about fathersinlaw and then i began to tell her about minebut
stop becaus my aunt had advis me to observ a silenc on that
subject a tender young cork howev would have had no more chanc
against a pair of corkscrew or a tender young tooth against a pair of
dentist or a littl shuttlecock against two battledor than i had
against uriah and mr heep thei did just what thei like with me and
worm thing out of me that i had no desir to tell with a certainti
i blush to think of the more especi as in my juvenil frank i
took some credit to myself for be so confidenti and felt that i wa
quit the patron of my two respect entertain
thei were veri fond of on anoth that wa certain i take it that
had it effect upon me as a touch of natur but the skill with which
the on follow up whatev the other said wa a touch of art which i
wa still less proof against when there wa noth more to be got

my dear said mr micawb if you will mention to copperfield what
our present posit is which i have no doubt he will like to know i
will go and look at the paper the while and see whether anyth turn
up among the advertis
i thought you were at plymouth maam i said to mr micawb as he
went out
my dear master copperfield she repli we went to plymouth
to be on the spot i hint
just so said mr micawb to be on the spot but the truth is
talent is not want in the custom hous the local influenc of my
famili wa quit unavail to obtain ani employ in that depart
for a man of mr micawb abil thei would rather not have a man
of mr micawb abil he would onli show the defici of the
other apart from which said mr micawb i will not disguis
from you my dear master copperfield that when that branch of my
famili which is settl in plymouth becam awar that mr micawb wa
accompani by myself and by littl wilkin and hi sister and by the
twin thei did not receiv him with that ardour which he might have
expect be so newli releas from captiv in fact said mr
micawb lower her voicethi is between ourselvesour recept
wa cool
dear me i said
ye said mr micawb it is truli pain to contempl mankind
in such an aspect master copperfield but our recept wa decidedli
cool there is no doubt about it in fact that branch of my famili
which is settl in plymouth becam quit person to mr micawb
befor we had been there a week
i said and thought that thei ought to be asham of themselv
still so it wa continu mr micawb under such circumst
what could a man of mr micawb spirit do but on obviou cours
wa left to borrow of that branch of my famili the monei to return to
london and to return at ani sacrific
then you all came back again maam i said
we all came back again repli mr micawb sinc then i have
consult other branch of my famili on the cours which it is most
expedi for mr micawb to takefor i maintain that he must take
some cours master copperfield said mr micawb argument
it is clear that a famili of six not includ a domest cannot live
upon air
certainli maam said i
the opinion of those other branch of my famili pursu mr
micawb is that mr micawb should immedi turn hi attent
to coal
to what maam
to coal said mr micawb to the coal trade mr micawb wa
induc to think on inquiri that there might be an open for a
man of hi talent in the medwai coal trade then as mr micawb veri
properli said the first step to be taken clearli wa to come and see
the medwai which we came and saw i sai we master copperfield for
i never will said mr micawb with emot i never will desert mr
micawb
i murmur my admir and approb
we came repeat mr micawb and saw the medwai my opinion of
the coal trade on that river is that it mai requir talent but that
it certainli requir capit talent mr micawb ha capit mr
micawb ha not we saw i think the greater part of the medwai and
that is my individu conclus be so near here mr micawb wa
of opinion that it would be rash not to come on and see the cathedr
firstli on account of it be so well worth see and our never
have seen it and secondli on account of the great probabl of
someth turn up in a cathedr town we have been here said mr
micawb three dai noth ha as yet turn up and it mai
not surpris you my dear master copperfield so much as it would a
stranger to know that we ar at present wait for a remitt from
london to discharg our pecuniari oblig at thi hotel until the
arriv of that remitt said mr micawb with much feel i am
cut off from my home i allud to lodg in pentonvil from my boi
and girl and from my twin
i felt the utmost sympathi for mr and mr micawb in thi anxiou
extrem and said as much to mr micawb who now return ad
that i onli wish i had monei enough to lend them the amount thei
need mr micawb answer express the disturb of hi mind he
said shake hand with me copperfield you ar a true friend but
when the worst come to the worst no man is without a friend who is
possess of shave materi at thi dread hint mr micawb
threw her arm round mr micawb neck and entreat him to be calm
he wept but so far recov almost immedi as to ring the bell
for the waiter and bespeak a hot kidnei pud and a plate of shrimp
for breakfast in the morn
when i took my leav of them thei both press me so much to come and
dine befor thei went awai that i could not refus but as i knew i
could not come next dai when i should have a good deal to prepar in
the even mr micawb arrang that he would call at doctor strong
in the cours of the morn have a presenti that the remitt
would arriv by that post and propos the dai after if it would suit
me better accordingli i wa call out of school next forenoon and
found mr micawb in the parlour who had call to sai that the dinner
would take place as propos when i ask him if the remitt had
come he press my hand and depart
as i wa look out of window that same even it surpris me and
made me rather uneasi to see mr micawb and uriah heep walk past arm
in arm uriah humbl sensibl of the honour that wa done him and mr
micawb take a bland delight in extend hi patronag to uriah but
i wa still more surpris when i went to the littl hotel next dai at
the appoint dinnerhour which wa four oclock to find from what
mr micawb said that he had gone home with uriah and had drunk
brandyandwat at mr heep
and ill tell you what my dear copperfield said mr micawb your
friend heep is a young fellow who might be attorneygener if i had
known that young man at the period when my difficulti came to a
crisi all i can sai is that i believ my creditor would have been a
great deal better manag than thei were
i hardli understood how thi could have been see that mr micawb
had paid them noth at all as it wa but i did not like to
ask neither did i like to sai that i hope he had not been too
commun to uriah or to inquir if thei had talk much about me
i wa afraid of hurt mr micawb feel or at all event mr
micawb she be veri sensit but i wa uncomfort about it
too and often thought about it afterward
we had a beauti littl dinner quit an eleg dish of fish the
kidneyend of a loin of veal roast fri sausagemeat a partridg
and a pud there wa wine and there wa strong al and after
dinner mr micawb made us a bowl of hot punch with her own hand
mr micawb wa uncommonli convivi i never saw him such good
compani he made hi face shine with the punch so that it look as if
it had been varnish all over he got cheerfulli sentiment about
the town and propos success to it observ that mr micawb and
himself had been made extrem snug and comfort there and that he
never should forget the agreeabl hour thei had pass in canterburi
he propos me afterward and he and mr micawb and i took a
review of our past acquaint in the cours of which we sold the
properti all over again then i propos mr micawb or at least
said modestli if youll allow me mr micawb i shall now have
the pleasur of drink your health maam on which mr micawb
deliv an eulogium on mr micawb charact and said she
had ever been hi guid philosoph and friend and that he would
recommend me when i came to a marri time of life to marri such
anoth woman if such anoth woman could be found
as the punch disappear mr micawb becam still more friendli and

lang syne when we came to here a hand my trusti frere we all
join hand round the tabl and when we declar we would take a
right gude willi waught and hadnt the least idea what it meant we

plan if mr jack maldon come home on account of ill health he must

other deserv member of her famili whom it wa desir to set on
their deserv leg
all thi time her daughter anni never onc spoke or lift up her
ey all thi time mr wickfield had hi glanc upon her as she sat
by hi own daughter side it appear to me that he never thought of

to whom he had written
why here said mr markleham take a letter from the chimneypiec

not to be obtain what i have endur and do endur here is
insupport and but for the promptitud of that best of creatur
said mr markleham telegraph the doctor as befor and refold
the letter it would be insupport to me to think of
mr wickfield said not on word though the old ladi look to him as if
for hi commentari on thi intellig but sat sever silent with
hi ey fix on the ground long after the subject wa dismiss
and other topic occupi us he remain so seldom rais hi ey
unless to rest them for a moment with a thought frown upon the
doctor or hi wife or both
the doctor wa veri fond of music agn sang with great sweet and
express and so did mr strong thei sang togeth and plai duet
togeth and we had quit a littl concert but i remark two thing
first that though anni soon recov her composur and wa quit
herself there wa a blank between her and mr wickfield which separ
them wholli from each other secondli that mr wickfield seem
to dislik the intimaci between her and agn and to watch it with
uneasi and now i must confess the recollect of what i had seen
on that night when mr maldon went awai first began to return upon me
with a mean it had never had and to troubl me the innoc beauti
of her face wa not as innoc to me as it had been i mistrust the
natur grace and charm of her manner and when i look at agn by her
side and thought how good and true agn wa suspicion aros within
me that it wa an illassort friendship
she wa so happi in it herself howev and the other wa so happi too
that thei made the even fly awai as if it were but an hour it close
in an incid which i well rememb thei were take leav of each
other and agn wa go to embrac her and kiss her when mr
wickfield step between them as if by accid and drew agn
quickli awai then i saw as though all the interven time had been
cancel and i were still stand in the doorwai on the night of the
departur the express of that night in the face of mr strong as
it confront hi
i cannot sai what an impress thi made upon me or how imposs i
found it when i thought of her afterward to separ her from thi
look and rememb her face in it innoc loveli again it haunt
me when i got home i seem to have left the doctor roof with a dark
cloud lower on it the rever that i had for hi grei head wa
mingl with commiser for hi faith in those who were treacher
to him and with resent against those who injur him the impend
shadow of a great afflict and a great disgrac that had no distinct
form in it yet fell like a stain upon the quiet place where i had
work and plai as a boi and did it a cruel wrong i had no pleasur
in think ani more of the grave old broadleav aloetre which
remain shut up in themselv a hundr year togeth and of the trim
smooth grassplot and the stone urn and the doctor walk and the
congeni sound of the cathedr bell hover abov them all it wa as
if the tranquil sanctuari of my boyhood had been sack befor my face
and it peac and honour given to the wind
but morn brought with it my part from the old hous which agn
had fill with her influenc and that occupi my mind suffici
i should be there again soon no doubt i might sleep againperhap
oftenin my old room but the dai of my inhabit there were gone
and the old time wa past i wa heavier at heart when i pack up such
of my book and cloth as still remain there to be sent to dover
than i care to show to uriah heep who wa so offici to help me
that i uncharit thought him mighti glad that i wa go
i got awai from agn and her father somehow with an indiffer show
of be veri manli and took my seat upon the box of the london coach
i wa so soften and forgiv go through the town that i had half
a mind to nod to my old enemi the butcher and throw him five shill
to drink but he look such a veri obdur butcher as he stood
scrape the great block in the shop and moreov hi appear wa
so littl improv by the loss of a front tooth which i had knock out
that i thought it best to make no advanc
the main object on my mind i rememb when we got fairli on the road
wa to appear as old as possibl to the coachman and to speak extrem
gruff the latter point i achiev at great person inconveni but
i stuck to it becaus i felt it wa a grownup sort of thing
you ar go through sir said the coachman
ye william i said condescendingli i knew him i am go to
london i shall go down into suffolk afterward
shoot sir said the coachman
he knew as well as i did that it wa just as like at that time of
year i wa go down there whale but i felt compliment too
i dont know i said pretend to be undecid whether i shall
take a shot or not bird is got weri shy im told said william
so i understand said i
is suffolk your counti sir ask william
ye i said with some import suffolk my counti
im told the dumpl is uncommon fine down there said william
i wa not awar of it myself but i felt it necessari to uphold the
institut of my counti and to evinc a familiar with them so i
shook my head as much as to sai i believ you
and the punch said william there cattl a suffolk punch when
he a good un is worth hi weight in gold did you ever breed ani
suffolk punch yourself sir
nno i said not exactli
here a genlmn behind me ill pound it said william as ha bred
em by wholesal
the gentleman spoken of wa a gentleman with a veri unpromis squint
and a promin chin who had a tall white hat on with a narrow flat
brim and whose closefit drab trouser seem to button all the wai
up outsid hi leg from hi boot to hi hip hi chin wa cock over
the coachman shoulder so near to me that hi breath quit tickl
the back of my head and as i look at him he leer at the leader
with the ey with which he didnt squint in a veri know manner
aint you ask william
aint i what said the gentleman behind
bred them suffolk punch by wholesal
i should think so said the gentleman there aint no sort of ors
that i aint bred and no sort of dorg ors and dorg is some
men fanci theyr wittl and drink to melodg wife and
childrenread write and arithmeticsnuff toback and sleep
that aint a sort of man to see sit behind a coachbox is it
though said william in my ear as he handl the rein
i constru thi remark into an indic of a wish that he should have
my place so i blushingli offer to resign it
well if you dont mind sir said william i think it would be more
correct
i have alwai consid thi as the first fall i had in life when i
book my place at the coach offic i had had box seat written against
the entri and had given the bookkeep halfacrown i wa got up in
a special greatcoat and shawl expressli to do honour to that
distinguish emin had glorifi myself upon it a good deal and
had felt that i wa a credit to the coach and here in the veri first
stage i wa supplant by a shabbi man with a squint who had no other
merit than smell like a liveryst and be abl to walk across
me more like a fly than a human be while the hors were at a
canter
a distrust of myself which ha often beset me in life on small
occas when it would have been better awai wa assuredli not
stop in it growth by thi littl incid outsid the canterburi
coach it wa in vain to take refug in gruff of speech i spoke
from the pit of my stomach for the rest of the journei but i felt
complet extinguish and dreadfulli young
it wa curiou and interest nevertheless to be sit up there
behind four hors well educ well dress and with plenti of
monei in my pocket and to look out for the place where i had slept on
my weari journei i had abund occup for my thought in everi
conspicu landmark on the road when i look down at the tramper
whom we pass and saw that wellrememb style of face turn up
i felt as if the tinker blacken hand were in the bosom of my shirt
again when we clatter through the narrow street of chatham and i
caught a glimps in pass of the lane where the old monster live
who had bought my jacket i stretch my neck eagerli to look for the
place where i had sat in the sun and in the shade wait for my
monei when we came at last within a stage of london and pass the
verit salem hous where mr creakl had laid about him with a heavi
hand i would have given all i had for law permiss to get down
and thrash him and let all the boi out like so mani cage sparrow
we went to the golden cross at chare cross then a mouldi sort of
establish in a close neighbourhood a waiter show me into the
coffeeroom and a chambermaid introduc me to my small bedchamb
which smelt like a hackneycoach and wa shut up like a famili vault
i wa still painfulli consciou of my youth for nobodi stood in ani aw
of me at all the chambermaid be utterli indiffer to my opinion
on ani subject and the waiter be familiar with me and offer
advic to my inexperi
well now said the waiter in a tone of confid what would you
like for dinner young gentlemen like poultri in gener have a fowl
i told him as majest as i could that i wasnt in the humour for
a fowl
aint you said the waiter young gentlemen is gener tire of
beef and mutton have a weal cutlet
i assent to thi propos in default of be abl to suggest
anyth els
do you care for tater said the waiter with an insinu smile
and hi head on on side young gentlemen gener ha been overdos
with tater
i command him in my deepest voic to order a veal cutlet and
potato and all thing fit and to inquir at the bar if there
were ani letter for trotwood copperfield esquirewhich i knew there
were not and couldnt be but thought it manli to appear to expect
he soon came back to sai that there were none at which i wa much
surpris and began to lai the cloth for my dinner in a box by the
fire while he wa so engag he ask me what i would take with it
and on my repli half a pint of sherri thought it a favour
opportun i am afraid to extract that measur of wine from the
stale leav at the bottom of sever small decant i am of thi
opinion becaus while i wa read the newspap i observ him
behind a low wooden partit which wa hi privat apart veri
busi pour out of a number of those vessel into on like a chemist
and druggist make up a prescript when the wine came too i
thought it flat and it certainli had more english crumb in it than
were to be expect in a foreign wine in anyth like a pure state but
i wa bash enough to drink it and sai noth
be then in a pleasant frame of mind from which i infer that
poison is not alwai disagre in some stage of the process i
resolv to go to the plai it wa covent garden theatr that i chose
and there from the back of a centr box i saw juliu caesar and the
new pantomim to have all those nobl roman aliv befor me and
walk in and out for my entertain instead of be the stern
taskmast thei had been at school wa a most novel and delight
effect but the mingl realiti and mysteri of the whole show the
influenc upon me of the poetri the light the music the compani the
smooth stupend chang of glitter and brilliant sceneri were so
dazzl and open up such illimit region of delight that when i
came out into the raini street at twelv oclock at night i felt as if
i had come from the cloud where i had been lead a romant life
for ag to a bawl splash linklight umbrellastruggl
hackneycoachjostl pattenclink muddi miser world
i had emerg by anoth door and stood in the street for a littl
while as if i realli were a stranger upon earth but the unceremoni
push and hustl that i receiv soon recal me to myself and
put me in the road back to the hotel whither i went revolv the
gloriou vision all the wai and where after some porter and oyster
i sat revolv it still at past on oclock with my ey on the
coffeeroom fire
i wa so fill with the plai and with the pastfor it wa in a
manner like a shine transpar through which i saw my earlier
life move alongthat i dont know when the figur of a handsom
wellform young man dress with a tast easi neglig which i
have reason to rememb veri well becam a real presenc to me but
i recollect be consciou of hi compani without have notic hi

at last i rose to go to bed much to the relief of the sleepi waiter
who had got the fidget in hi leg and wa twist them and hit
them and put them through all kind of contort in hi small
pantri in go toward the door i pass the person who had come in
and saw him plainli i turn directli came back and look again he
did not know me but i knew him in a moment
at anoth time i might have want the confid or the decis to
speak to him and might have put it off until next dai and might have
lost him but in the then condit of my mind where the plai wa
still run high hi former protect of me appear so deserv
of my gratitud and my old love for him overflow my breast so freshli
and spontan that i went up to him at onc with a fastbeat
heart and said

a broom stood peep out of window at king charl on horseback
surround by a maze of hackneycoach and look anyth but regal
in a drizzl rain and a darkbrown fog until i wa admonish by the
waiter that the gentleman wa wait for me
it wa not in the coffeeroom that i found steerforth expect me but
in a snug privat apart redcurtain and turkeycarpet where

old brick hous at highgat on the summit of the hill an elderli ladi
though not veri far advanc in year with a proud carriag and
a handsom face wa in the doorwai as we alight and greet
steerforth as my dearest jame fold him in her arm to thi ladi
he present me as hi mother and she gave me a state welcom
it wa a genteel oldfashion hous veri quiet and orderli from the
window of my room i saw all london ly in the distanc like a great
vapour with here and there some light twinkl through it i had onli
time in dress to glanc at the solid furnitur the frame piec
of work done i suppos by steerforth mother when she wa a girl
and some pictur in crayon of ladi with powder hair and bodic
come and go on the wall as the newlykindl fire crackl and
sputter when i wa call to dinner
there wa a second ladi in the diningroom of a slight short figur
dark and not agreeabl to look at but with some appear of good
look too who attract my attent perhap becaus i had not
expect to see her perhap becaus i found myself sit opposit
to her perhap becaus of someth realli remark in her she had
black hair and eager black ey and wa thin and had a scar upon her
lip it wa an old scari should rather call it seam for it wa not
discolour and had heal year agowhich had onc cut through her
mouth downward toward the chin but wa now bare visibl across
the tabl except abov and on her upper lip the shape of which it had
alter i conclud in my own mind that she wa about thirti year
of ag and that she wish to be marri she wa a littl
dilapidatedlik a housewith have been so long to let yet had as
i have said an appear of good look her thin seem to be the
effect of some wast fire within her which found a vent in her gaunt
ey
she wa introduc as miss dartl and both steerforth and hi mother
call her rosa i found that she live there and had been for a long
time mr steerforth companion it appear to me that she never said
anyth she want to sai outright but hint it and made a great
deal more of it by thi practic for exampl when mr steerforth
observ more in jest than earnest that she fear her son led but a
wild life at colleg miss dartl put in thu
oh realli you know how ignor i am and that i onli ask for
inform but isnt it alwai so i thought that kind of life wa
on all hand understood to beeh it is educ for a veri grave
profess if you mean that rosa mr steerforth answer with some
cold
oh ye that veri true return miss dartl but isnt it
thoughi want to be put right if i am wrongisnt it realli

oh you mean it not return miss dartl well im veri glad to
hear it now i know what to do that the advantag of ask i shall
never allow peopl to talk befor me about wast and profligaci
and so forth in connexion with that life ani more

conscienti gentleman and if i had not implicit relianc on my son i
should have relianc on him

how veri nice exclaim miss dartl what a comfort realli
conscienti then he notbut of cours he cant be if he realli
conscienti well i shall be quit happi in my opinion of him from
thi time you cant think how it elev him in my opinion to know
for certain that he realli conscienti
her own view of everi question and her correct of everyth that
wa said to which she wa oppos miss dartl insinu in the same
wai sometim i could not conceal from myself with great power
though in contradict even of steerforth an instanc happen befor
dinner wa done mr steerforth speak to me about my intent
of go down into suffolk i said at hazard how glad i should be if
steerforth would onli go there with me and explain to him that i wa
go to see my old nurs and mr peggotti famili i remind him of
the boatman whom he had seen at school
oh that bluff fellow said steerforth he had a son with him hadnt
he
no that wa hi nephew i repli whom he adopt though as
a son he ha a veri pretti littl niec too whom he adopt as a
daughter in short hi houseor rather hi boat for he live in on
on dry landi full of peopl who ar object of hi generos and
kind you would be delight to see that household
should i said steerforth well i think i should i must see what
can be done it would be worth a journei not to mention the pleasur of
a journei with you daisi to see that sort of peopl togeth and to
make on of em
my heart leap with a new hope of pleasur but it wa in refer
to the tone in which he had spoken of that sort of peopl that miss
dartl whose sparkl ey had been watch of us now broke in
again
oh but realli do tell me ar thei though she said
ar thei what and ar who what said steerforth
that sort of peoplear thei realli anim and clod and be of
anoth order i want to know so much
why there a pretti wide separ between them and us said
steerforth with indiffer thei ar not to be expect to be
as sensit as we ar their delicaci is not to be shock or hurt
easili thei ar wonderfulli virtuou i dare saysom peopl contend
for that at least and i am sure i dont want to contradict thembut
thei have not veri fine natur and thei mai be thank that like
their coars rough skin thei ar not easili wound
realli said miss dartl well i dont know now when i have been
better pleas than to hear that it so consol it such a delight
to know that when thei suffer thei dont feel sometim i have been
quit uneasi for that sort of peopl but now i shall just dismiss the
idea of them altogeth live and learn i had my doubt i confess
but now theyr clear up i didnt know and now i do know and that
show the advantag of askingdont it
i believ that steerforth had said what he had in jest or to draw
miss dartl out and i expect him to sai as much when she wa gone
and we two were sit befor the fire but he mere ask me what i
thought of her
she is veri clever is she not i ask
clever she bring everyth to a grindston said steerforth and
sharpen it as she ha sharpen her own face and figur these year
past she ha worn herself awai by constant sharpen she is all
edg
what a remark scar that is upon her lip i said
steerforth face fell and he paus a moment
why the fact is he return i did that
by an unfortun accid
no i wa a young boi and she exasper me and i threw a hammer at
her a promis young angel i must have been i wa deepli sorri to
have touch on such a pain theme but that wa useless now
she ha born the mark ever sinc as you see said steerforth and
shell bear it to her grave if she ever rest in onethough i can
hardli believ she will ever rest anywher she wa the motherless child
of a sort of cousin of my father he di on dai my mother who wa
then a widow brought her here to be compani to her she ha a coupl of
thousand pound of her own and save the interest of it everi year to
add to the princip there the histori of miss rosa dartl for you
and i have no doubt she love you like a brother said i
humph retort steerforth look at the fire some brother ar
not love over much and some lovebut help yourself copperfield
well drink the daisi of the field in compliment to you and the
lili of the vallei that toil not neither do thei spin in compliment
to meth more shame for me a moodi smile that had overspread hi
featur clear off as he said thi merrili and he wa hi own frank
win self again
i could not help glanc at the scar with a pain interest when we
went in to tea it wa not long befor i observ that it wa the most
suscept part of her face and that when she turn pale that mark
alter first and becam a dull leadcolour streak lengthen out
to it full extent like a mark in invis ink brought to the fire
there wa a littl alterc between her and steerforth about a cast
of the dice at backgammonwhen i thought her for on moment in a
storm of rage and then i saw it start forth like the old write on the
wall
it wa no matter of wonder to me to find mr steerforth devot to her
son she seem to be abl to speak or think about noth els she
show me hi pictur as an infant in a locket with some of hi
babyhair in it she show me hi pictur as he had been when i first
knew him and she wore at her breast hi pictur as he wa now all the
letter he had ever written to her she kept in a cabinet near her own
chair by the fire and she would have read me some of them and i should
have been veri glad to hear them too if he had not interpos and
coax her out of the design
it wa at mr creakl my son tell me that you first becam
acquaint said mr steerforth as she and i were talk at on
tabl while thei plai backgammon at anoth inde i recollect hi
speak at that time of a pupil younger than himself who had taken
hi fanci there but your name as you mai suppos ha not live in my
memori
he wa veri gener and nobl to me in those dai i assur you
maam said i and i stood in need of such a friend i should have
been quit crush without him
he is alwai gener and nobl said mr steerforth proudli
i subscrib to thi with all my heart god know she knew i did for
the stateli of her manner alreadi abat toward me except when she
spoke in prais of him and then her air wa alwai lofti
it wa not a fit school gener for my son said she far from it
but there were particular circumst to be consid at the time of
more import even than that select my son high spirit made
it desir that he should be place with some man who felt it
superior and would be content to bow himself befor it and we found
such a man there
i knew that know the fellow and yet i did not despis him the more
for it but thought it a redeem qualiti in him if he could be allow
ani grace for not resist on so irresist as steerforth
my son great capac wa tempt on there by a feel of
voluntari emul and consciou pride the fond ladi went on to sai
he would have risen against all constraint but he found himself the
monarch of the place and he haughtili determin to be worthi of hi
station it wa like himself
i echo with all my heart and soul that it wa like himself
so my son took of hi own will and on no compuls to the cours
in which he can alwai when it is hi pleasur outstrip everi
competitor she pursu my son inform me mr copperfield that
you were quit devot to him and that when you met yesterdai you made
yourself known to him with tear of joi i should be an affect woman
if i made ani pretenc of be surpris by my son inspir such
emot but i cannot be indiffer to anyon who is so sensibl of
hi merit and i am veri glad to see you here and can assur you that
he feel an unusu friendship for you and that you mai reli on hi
protect
miss dartl plai backgammon as eagerli as she did everyth els
if i had seen her first at the board i should have fanci that her
figur had got thin and her ey had got larg over that pursuit and
no other in the world but i am veri much mistaken if she miss a
word of thi or lost a look of mine as i receiv it with the utmost
pleasur and honour by mr steerforth confid felt older than
i had done sinc i left canterburi
when the even wa pretti far spent and a trai of glass and
decant came in steerforth promis over the fire that he would
serious think of go down into the countri with me there wa no
hurri he said a week henc would do and hi mother hospit said
the same while we were talk he more than onc call me daisi
which brought miss dartl out again
but realli mr copperfield she ask is it a nicknam and
why doe he give it you is itehbecaus he think you young and
innoc i am so stupid in these thing
i colour in repli that i believ it wa
oh said miss dartl now i am glad to know that i ask for
inform and i am glad to know it he think you young and innoc
and so you ar hi friend well that quit delight
she went to bed soon after thi and mr steerforth retir too
steerforth and i after linger for halfanhour over the fire
talk about traddl and all the rest of them at old salem hous went
upstair togeth steerforth room wa next to mine and i went in to
look at it it wa a pictur of comfort full of easychair cushion
and footstool work by hi mother hand and with no sort of thing
omit that could help to render it complet final her handsom
featur look down on her darl from a portrait on the wall as if
it were even someth to her that her like should watch him while
he slept
i found the fire burn clear enough in my room by thi time and the
curtain drawn befor the window and round the bed give it a veri
snug appear i sat down in a great chair upon the hearth to medit
on my happi and had enjoi the contempl of it for some time
when i found a like of miss dartl look eagerli at me from abov
the chimneypiec
it wa a startl like and necessarili had a startl look the
painter hadnt made the scar but i made it and there it wa come
and go now confin to the upper lip as i had seen it at dinner and
now show the whole extent of the wound inflict by the hammer as i
had seen it when she wa passion
i wonder peevishli why thei couldnt put her anywher els instead
of quarter her on me to get rid of her i undress quickli
extinguish my light and went to bed but as i fell asleep i could
not forget that she wa still there look is it realli though
i want to know and when i awok in the night i found that i wa
uneasili ask all sort of peopl in my dream whether it realli wa
or notwithout know what i meant
chapter 21 littl emli
there wa a servant in that hous a man who i understood wa usual
with steerforth and had come into hi servic at the univers who
wa in appear a pattern of respect i believ there never
exist in hi station a more respectablelook man he wa taciturn
softfoot veri quiet in hi manner deferenti observ alwai at
hand when want and never near when not want but hi great claim to
consider wa hi respect he had not a pliant face he had
rather a stiff neck rather a tight smooth head with short hair cling
to it at the side a soft wai of speak with a peculiar habit of
whisper the letter s so distinctli that he seem to us it
often than ani other man but everi peculiar that he had he made
respect if hi nose had been upsidedown he would have made that
respect he surround himself with an atmospher of respect
and walk secur in it it would have been next to imposs to
suspect him of anyth wrong he wa so thoroughli respect
nobodi could have thought of put him in a liveri he wa so highli
respect to have impos ani derogatori work upon him would have
been to inflict a wanton insult on the feel of a most respect
man and of thi i noticedth womenserv in the household were
so intuit consciou that thei alwai did such work themselv and
gener while he read the paper by the pantri fire
such a selfcontain man i never saw but in that qualiti as in everi
other he possess he onli seem to be the more respect even the
fact that no on knew hi christian name seem to form a part of hi
respect noth could be object against hi surnam littim
by which he wa known peter might have been hang or tom transport
but littim wa perfectli respect
it wa occas i suppos by the reverend natur of respect
in the abstract but i felt particularli young in thi man presenc
how old he wa himself i could not guessand that again went to hi
credit on the same score for in the calm of respect he might
have number fifti year as well as thirti
littim wa in my room in the morn befor i wa up to bring me that
reproach shavingwat and to put out my cloth when i undrew the
curtain and look out of bed i saw him in an equabl temperatur
of respect unaffect by the east wind of januari and not
even breath frostili stand my boot right and left in the first
danc posit and blow speck of dust off my coat as he laid it
down like a babi
i gave him good morn and ask him what oclock it wa he took
out of hi pocket the most respect huntingwatch i ever saw and
prevent the spring with hi thumb from open far look in at the
face as if he were consult an oracular oyster shut it up again and
said if i pleas it wa half past eight
mr steerforth will be glad to hear how you have rest sir
thank you said i veri well inde is mr steerforth quit well
thank you sir mr steerforth is toler well anoth of hi
characteristicsno us of superl a cool calm medium alwai

i thank you sir if you pleas and with that and with a littl
inclin of hi head when he pass the bedsid as an apolog for
correct me he went out shut the door as delic as if i had
just fallen into a sweet sleep on which my life depend
everi morn we held exactli thi convers never ani more and
never ani less and yet invari howev far i might have been
lift out of myself overnight and advanc toward matur year
by steerforth companionship or mr steerforth confid or miss
dartl convers in the presenc of thi most respect man i
becam as our smaller poet sing a boi again
he got hors for us and steerforth who knew everyth gave me
lesson in ride he provid foil for us and steerforth gave me
lesson in fencingglov and i began of the same master to improv
in box it gave me no manner of concern that steerforth should find
me a novic in these scienc but i never could bear to show my want of
skill befor the respect littim i had no reason to believ
that littim understood such art himself he never led me to suppos
anyth of the kind by so much as the vibrat of on of hi
respect eyelash yet whenev he wa by while we were practis
i felt myself the greenest and most inexperienc of mortal
i am particular about thi man becaus he made a particular effect on
me at that time and becaus of what took place thereaft
the week pass awai in a most delight manner it pass rapidli as
mai be suppos to on entranc as i wa and yet it gave me so mani
occas for know steerforth better and admir him more in a
thousand respect that at it close i seem to have been with him
for a much longer time a dash wai he had of treat me like a
playth wa more agreeabl to me than ani behaviour he could have
adopt it remind me of our old acquaint it seem the natur
sequel of it it show me that he wa unchang it reliev me of
ani uneasi i might have felt in compar my merit with hi and
measur my claim upon hi friendship by ani equal standard abov
all it wa a familiar unrestrain affection demeanour that he
us toward no on els as he had treat me at school differ
from all the rest i joyfulli believ that he treat me in life unlik
ani other friend he had i believ that i wa nearer to hi heart than
ani other friend and my own heart warm with attach to him he
made up hi mind to go with me into the countri and the dai arriv for
our departur he had been doubt at first whether to take littim
or not but decid to leav him at home the respect creatur

town ar mad against her
nonsens father cri minni
my dear said mr omer i dont sai it the case with you wink

minni and not have given them ani hold to talk about her and then
thei couldnt have done it
couldnt have done it my dear retort mr omer couldnt have
done it is that your knowledg of life what is there that ani woman
couldnt do that she shouldnt doespeci on the subject of anoth
woman good look
i realli thought it wa all over with mr omer after he had utter
thi libel pleasantri he cough to that extent and hi breath
elud all hi attempt to recov it with that obstinaci that i fulli
expect to see hi head go down behind the counter and hi littl
black breech with the rusti littl bunch of ribbon at the knee
come quiver up in a last ineffectu struggl at length howev
he got better though he still pant hard and wa so exhaust that he
wa oblig to sit on the stool of the shopdesk

hasnt taken much to ani companion here she hasnt taken kindli to
ani particular acquaint and friend not to mention sweetheart in

she would like to do soandso for her uncledont you seeand bui
him suchandsuch fine thing
i assur you mr omer she ha said so to me i return eagerli
when we were both children
mr omer nod hi head and rub hi chin just so then out of a
veri littl she could dress herself you see better than most other
could out of a deal and that made thing unpleas moreov she wa
rather what might be call waywardil go so far as to sai what i
should call wayward myself said mr omer didnt know her own mind
quitea littl spoiledand couldnt at first exactli bind herself
down no more than that wa ever said against her minni
no father said mr joram that the worst i believ
so when she got a situat said mr omer to keep a fractiou old
ladi compani thei didnt veri well agre and she didnt stop at last
she came here apprent for three year nearli two of em ar over
and she ha been as good a girl as ever wa worth ani six minni is

doubt that she wa near on my ask now if that were not so mr

most beauti littl creatur with the cloudless blue ey that had
look into my childish heart turn laughingli upon anoth child
of minni who wa plai near her with enough of wil in her
bright face to justifi what i had heard with much of the old caprici
coy lurk in it but with noth in her pretti look i am sure
but what wa meant for good and for happi and what wa on a
good and happi cours
the tune across the yard that seem as if it never had left offala
it wa the tune that never doe leav offwa beat softli all the
while
wouldnt you like to step in said mr omer and speak to her walk
in and speak to her sir make yourself at home
i wa too bash to do so theni wa afraid of confus her and i

daughter and her littl children went awai to my dear old peggotti
here she wa in the tile kitchen cook dinner the moment i knock

as she meant to for as often as she got to the door and look round
at me she came back again to have anoth laugh and anoth cry upon my
shoulder at last to make the matter easier i went upstair with
her and have wait outsid for a minut while she said a word of
prepar to mr barki present myself befor that invalid
he receiv me with absolut enthusiasm he wa too rheumat to be
shaken hand with but he beg me to shake the tassel on the top of
hi nightcap which i did most cordial when i sat down by the side
of the bed he said that it did him a world of good to feel as if he
wa drive me on the blunderston road again as he lai in bed face
upward and so cover with that except that he seem to be
noth but a facelik a convent cherubimh look the queerest

mr barki nod hi nightcap which wa hi onli mean of emphasi

mr barki turn hi ey upon me as if for my assent to thi result
of hi reflect in bed and i gave it
noth truer than them repeat mr barki a man as poor as i
am find that out in hi mind when he laid up im a veri poor man
sir
i am sorri to hear it mr barki
a veri poor man inde i am said mr barki
here hi right hand came slowli and feebli from under the bedcloth
and with a purposeless uncertain grasp took hold of a stick which wa
loos ti to the side of the bed after some poke about with
thi instrument in the cours of which hi face assum a varieti of
distract express mr barki poke it against a box an end
of which had been visibl to me all the time then hi face becam
compos
old cloth said mr barki
oh said i
i wish it wa monei sir said mr barki
i wish it wa inde said i
but it aint said mr barki open both hi ey as wide as he
possibl could
i express myself quit sure of that and mr barki turn hi ey
more gentli to hi wife said
she the usefullest and best of women c p barki all the prais
that anyon can give to c p barki she deserv and more my dear
youll get a dinner todai for compani someth good to eat and drink
will you
i should have protest against thi unnecessari demonstr in
my honour but that i saw peggotti on the opposit side of the bed
extrem anxiou i should not so i held my peac
i have got a trifl of monei somewher about me my dear said mr
barki but im a littl tire if you and mr david will leav me for
a short nap ill try and find it when i wake
we left the room in complianc with thi request when we got outsid
the door peggotti inform me that mr barki be now a littl
nearer than he us to be alwai resort to thi same devic befor
produc a singl coin from hi store and that he endur unheardof
agoni in crawl out of bed alon and take it from that unlucki
box in effect we present heard him utter suppress groan of the
most dismal natur as thi magpi proceed rack him in everi joint
but while peggotti ey were full of compass for him she said hi
gener impuls would do him good and it wa better not to check it
so he groan on until he had got into bed again suffer i have no
doubt a martyrdom and then call us in pretend to have just
woke up from a refresh sleep and to produc a guinea from under hi
pillow hi satisfact in which happi imposit on us and in
have preserv the impenetr secret of the box appear to be a
suffici compens to him for all hi tortur
i prepar peggotti for steerforth arriv and it wa not long befor
he came i am persuad she knew no differ between hi have been a
person benefactor of her and a kind friend to me and that she would
have receiv him with the utmost gratitud and devot in ani case
but hi easi spirit good humour hi genial manner hi handsom
look hi natur gift of adapt himself to whomsoev he pleas
and make direct when he care to do it to the main point of interest
in anybodi heart bound her to him wholli in five minut hi
manner to me alon would have won her but through all these caus
combin i sincer believ she had a kind of ador for him befor
he left the hous that night
he stai there with me to dinnerif i were to sai willingli i should
not half express how readili and gaili he went into mr barkiss room
like light and air brighten and refresh it as if he were healthi
weather there wa no nois no effort no conscious in anyth
he did but in everyth an indescrib light a seem
imposs of do anyth els or do anyth better which
wa so grace so natur and agreeabl that it overcom me even
now in the remembr
we made merri in the littl parlour where the book of martyr
unthumb sinc my time wa laid out upon the desk as of old and where
i now turn over it terrif pictur rememb the old sensat
thei had awaken but not feel them when peggotti spoke of what
she call my room and of it be readi for me at night and of her
hope i would occupi it befor i could so much as look at steerforth
hesit he wa possess of the whole case
of cours he said youll sleep here while we stai and i shall
sleep at the hotel
but to bring you so far i return and to separ seem bad
companionship steerforth
why in the name of heaven where do you natur belong he said
what is seem compar to that it wa settl at onc
he maintain all hi delight qualiti to the last until we start
forth at eight oclock for mr peggotti boat inde thei were more
and more brightli exhibit as the hour went on for i thought even
then and i have no doubt now that the conscious of success in hi
determin to pleas inspir him with a new delicaci of percept
and made it subtl as it wa more easi to him if anyon had told me
then that all thi wa a brilliant game plai for the excit of
the moment for the employ of high spirit in the thoughtless love
of superior in a mere wast careless cours of win what wa
worthless to him and next minut thrown awayi sai if anyon had told
me such a lie that night i wonder in what manner of receiv it my
indign would have found a vent probabl onli in an increas had
that been possibl of the romant feel of fidel and friendship
with which i walk besid him over the dark wintri sand toward the
old boat the wind sigh around us even more mournfulli than it had
sigh and moan upon the night when i first darken mr peggotti
door
thi is a wild kind of place steerforth is it not
dismal enough in the dark he said and the sea roar as if it were
hungri for us is that the boat where i see a light yonder that
the boat said i

door i laid my hand upon the latch and whisper steerforth to keep
close to me went in
a murmur of voic had been audibl on the outsid and at the
moment of our entranc a clap of hand which latter nois i
wa surpris to see proceed from the gener disconsol mr
gummidg but mr gummidg wa not the onli person there who wa
unusu excit mr peggotti hi face light up with uncommon
satisfact and laugh with all hi might held hi rough arm
wide open as if for littl emli to run into them ham with a mix

manwould sai betterwhat he meant
i thought it affect to see such a sturdi fellow as ham wa now
trembl in the strength of what he felt for the pretti littl creatur
who had won hi heart i thought the simpl confid repos in us by
mr peggotti and by himself wa in itself affect i wa affect
by the stori altogeth how far my emot were influenc by the
recollect of my childhood i dont know whether i had come there
with ani linger fanci that i wa still to love littl emli i dont
know i know that i wa fill with pleasur by all thi but at first
with an indescrib sensit pleasur that a veri littl would have
chang to pain
therefor if it had depend upon me to touch the prevail chord
among them with ani skill i should have made a poor hand of it but it
depend upon steerforth and he did it with such address that in a few
minut we were all as easi and as happi as it wa possibl to be
mr peggotti he said you ar a thoroughli good fellow and deserv
to be as happi as you ar tonight my hand upon it ham i give you
joi my boi my hand upon that too daisi stir the fire and make it a
brisk on and mr peggotti unless you can induc your gentl niec to
come back for whom i vacat thi seat in the corner i shall go
ani gap at your firesid on such a nightsuch a gap least of alli
wouldnt make for the wealth of the indi
so mr peggotti went into my old room to fetch littl emli at first
littl emli didnt like to come and then ham went present thei
brought her to the firesid veri much confus and veri shybut
she soon becam more assur when she found how gentli and respectfulli
steerforth spoke to her how skilfulli he avoid anyth that would
embarrass her how he talk to mr peggotti of boat and ship and
tide and fish how he refer to me about the time when he had seen
mr peggotti at salem hous how delight he wa with the boat and all
belong to it how lightli and easili he carri on until he brought
us by degre into a charm circl and we were all talk awai
without ani reserv
emli inde said littl all the even but she look and
listen and her face got anim and she wa charm steerforth
told a stori of a dismal shipwreck which aros out of hi talk with mr
peggotti as if he saw it all befor himand littl emli ey were
fasten on him all the time as if she saw it too he told us a merri
adventur of hi own as a relief to that with as much gaieti as if the
narr were as fresh to him as it wa to usand littl emli
laugh until the boat rang with the music sound and we all laugh
steerforth too in irresist sympathi with what wa so pleasant and
lightheart he got mr peggotti to sing or rather to roar when
the stormi wind do blow do blow do blow and he sang a sailor
song himself so pathet and beautifulli that i could have almost
fanci that the real wind creep sorrowfulli round the hous and
murmur low through our unbroken silenc wa there to listen
as to mr gummidg he rous that victim of despond with a success
never attain by anyon els so mr peggotti inform me sinc
the deceas of the old on he left her so littl leisur for be
miser that she said next dai she thought she must have been
bewitch
but he set up no monopoli of the gener attent or the convers
when littl emli grew more courag and talk but still bashfulli
across the fire to me of our old wander upon the beach to pick up
shell and pebbl and when i ask her if she recollect how i us
to be devot to her and when we both laugh and redden cast
these look back on the pleasant old time so unreal to look at now he
wa silent and attent and observ us thoughtfulli she sat at thi
time and all the even on the old locker in her old littl corner
by the fireham besid her where i us to sit i could not satisfi
myself whether it wa in her own littl torment wai or in a maidenli
reserv befor us that she kept quit close to the wall and awai from
him but i observ that she did so all the even
as i rememb it wa almost midnight when we took our leav we had had
some biscuit and dri fish for supper and steerforth had produc from
hi pocket a full flask of holland which we men i mai sai we men
now without a blush had empti we part merrili and as thei all
stood crowd round the door to light us as far as thei could upon our
road i saw the sweet blue ey of littl emli peep after us from
behind ham and heard her soft voic call to us to be care how we
went
a most engag littl beauti said steerforth take my arm well
it a quaint place and thei ar quaint compani and it quit a new
sensat to mix with them
how fortun we ar too i return to have arriv to wit
their happi in that intend marriag i never saw peopl so happi
how delight to see it and to be made the sharer in their honest
joi as we have been
that rather a chucklehead fellow for the girl isnt he said
steerforth
he had been so hearti with him and with them all that i felt a shock
in thi unexpect and cold repli but turn quickli upon him and
see a laugh in hi ey i answer much reliev
ah steerforth it well for you to joke about the poor you mai
skirmish with miss dartl or try to hide your sympathi in jest from
me but i know better when i see how perfectli you understand them how
exquisit you can enter into happi like thi plain fisherman
or humour a love like my old nurs i know that there is not a joi or
sorrow not an emot of such peopl that can be indiffer to you
and i admir and love you for it steerforth twenti time the more
he stop and look in my face said daisi i believ you ar
in earnest and ar good i wish we all were next moment he wa
gaili sing mr peggotti song as we walk at a round pace back to
yarmouth
chapter 22 some old scene and some new peopl
steerforth and i stai for more than a fortnight in that part of the
countri we were veri much togeth i need not sai but occasion we
were asund for some hour at a time he wa a good sailor and i wa
but an indiffer on and when he went out boat with mr peggotti
which wa a favourit amus of hi i gener remain ashor my
occup of peggotti spareroom put a constraint upon me from which
he wa free for know how assidu she attend on mr barki
all dai i did not like to remain out late at night wherea steerforth
ly at the inn had noth to consult but hi own humour thu it
came about that i heard of hi make littl treat for the fishermen
at mr peggotti hous of call the will mind after i wa in bed
and of hi be afloat wrap in fishermen cloth whole moonlight
night and come back when the morn tide wa at flood by thi
time howev i knew that hi restless natur and bold spirit
delight to find a vent in rough toil and hard weather as in ani other
mean of excit that present itself freshli to him so none of hi
proceed surpris me
anoth caus of our be sometim apart wa that i had natur an
interest in go over to blunderston and revisit the old familiar
scene of my childhood while steerforth after be there onc had
natur no great interest in go there again henc on three or
four dai that i can at onc recal we went our sever wai after an
earli breakfast and met again at a late dinner i had no idea how he
emploi hi time in the interv beyond a gener knowledg that
he wa veri popular in the place and had twenti mean of activ
divert himself where anoth man might not have found on
for my own part my occup in my solitari pilgrimag wa to recal
everi yard of the old road as i went along it and to haunt the old
spot of which i never tire i haunt them as my memori had often
done and linger among them as my younger thought had linger when i
wa far awai the grave beneath the tree where both my parent layon
which i had look out when it wa my father onli with such curiou
feel of compass and by which i had stood so desol when it
wa open to receiv my pretti mother and her babyth grave which
peggotti own faith care had ever sinc kept neat and made a garden
of i walk near by the hour it lai a littl off the churchyard path
in a quiet corner not so far remov but i could read the name
upon the stone as i walk to and fro startl by the sound of the
churchbel when it struck the hour for it wa like a depart voic to
me my reflect at these time were alwai associ with the figur
i wa to make in life and the distinguish thing i wa to do my
echo footstep went to no other tune but were as constant to that as
if i had come home to build my castl in the air at a live mother
side
there were great chang in my old home the rag nest so long
desert by the rook were gone and the tree were lop and top
out of their rememb shape the garden had run wild and half the
window of the hous were shut up it wa occupi but onli by a poor
lunat gentleman and the peopl who took care of him he wa alwai
sit at my littl window look out into the churchyard and i
wonder whether hi rambl thought ever went upon ani of the fanci
that us to occupi mine on the rosi morn when i peep out of
that same littl window in my nightcloth and saw the sheep quietli
feed in the light of the rise sun
our old neighbour mr and mr grayper were gone to south america
and the rain had made it wai through the roof of their empti hous
and stain the outer wall mr chillip wa marri again to a tall
rawbon highnos wife and thei had a weazen littl babi with a
heavi head that it couldnt hold up and two weak stare ey with
which it seem to be alwai wonder why it had ever been born
it wa with a singular jumbl of sad and pleasur that i us to
linger about my nativ place until the redden winter sun admonish
me that it wa time to start on my return walk but when the place
wa left behind and especi when steerforth and i were happili
seat over our dinner by a blaze fire it wa delici to think of
have been there so it wa though in a soften degre when i
went to my neat room at night and turn over the leav of the
crocodilebook which wa alwai there upon a littl tabl rememb
with a grate heart how blest i wa in have such a friend as
steerforth such a friend as peggotti and such a substitut for what i
had lost as my excel and gener aunt
my nearest wai to yarmouth in come back from these long walk wa by
a ferri it land me on the flat between the town and the sea which i
could make straight across and so save myself a consider circuit by
the high road mr peggotti hous be on that wasteplac and not
a hundr yard out of my track i alwai look in as i went by
steerforth wa pretti sure to be there expect me and we went on
togeth through the frosti air and gather fog toward the twinkl
light of the town
on dark even when i wa later than usualfor i had that dai been
make my part visit to blunderston as we were now about to return
homei found him alon in mr peggotti hous sit thoughtfulli
befor the fire he wa so intent upon hi own reflect that he wa
quit unconsci of my approach thi inde he might easili have
been if he had been less absorb for footstep fell noiselessli on the
sandi ground outsid but even my entranc fail to rous him i wa
stand close to him look at him and still with a heavi brow he
wa lost in hi medit
he gave such a start when i put my hand upon hi shoulder that he made
me start too
you come upon me he said almost angrili like a reproach ghost
i wa oblig to announc myself somehow i repli have i call
you down from the star
no he answer no
up from anywher then said i take my seat near him
i wa look at the pictur in the fire he return
but you ar spoil them for me said i as he stir it quickli
with a piec of burn wood strike out of it a train of redhot
spark that went career up the littl chimnei and roar out into
the air

time neither dai nor night how late you ar where have you been
i have been take leav of my usual walk said i

i wish with all my soul i had been better guid he exclaim i
wish with all my soul i could guid myself better
there wa a passion deject in hi manner that quit amaz me he
wa more unlik himself than i could have suppos possibl
it would be better to be thi poor peggotti or hi lout of a nephew
he said get up and lean moodili against the chimneypiec with
hi face toward the fire than to be myself twenti time richer and
twenti time wiser and be the torment to myself that i have been in
thi devil bark of a boat within the last halfhour
i wa so confound by the alter in him that at first i could onli
observ him in silenc as he stood lean hi head upon hi hand and
look gloomili down at the fire at length i beg him with all
the earnest i felt to tell me what had occur to cross him so
unusu and to let me sympath with him if i could not hope to
advis him befor i had well conclud he began to laughfretfulli at
first but soon with return gaieti

inn in london i am heavi compani for myself sometim i have been a
nightmar to myself just nowmust have had on i think at odd dull

he look veri steadili at me i fear that some differ between him
and hi mother might have led to hi be in the frame of mind in which
i had found him at the solitari firesid i hint so
oh no he said shake hi head and give a slight laugh noth
of the sort ye he is come down that man of mine
the same as ever said i
the same as ever said steerforth distant and quiet as the north
pole he shall see to the boat be fresh name she the stormi
petrel now what doe mr peggotti care for stormi petrel ill have

the littl emli
as he had continu to look steadili at me i took it as a remind that
he object to be extol for hi consider i could not help
show in my face how much it pleas me but i said littl and he
resum hi usual smile and seem reliev
but see here he said look befor us where the origin littl
emli come and that fellow with her eh upon my soul he a true
knight he never leav her
ham wa a boatbuild in these dai have improv a natur
ingenu in that handicraft until he had becom a skill workman he
wa in hi workingdress and look rug enough but manli withal
and a veri fit protector for the bloom littl creatur at hi
side inde there wa a frank in hi face an honesti and an
undisguis show of hi pride in her and hi love for her which were
to me the best of good look i thought as thei came toward us that
thei were well match even in that particular
she withdrew her hand timidli from hi arm as we stop to speak to
them and blush as she gave it to steerforth and to me when thei
pass on after we had exchang a few word she did not like to
replac that hand but still appear timid and constrain walk
by herself i thought all thi veri pretti and engag and steerforth
seem to think so too as we look after them fade awai in the light
of a young moon
suddenli there pass usevid follow thema young woman whose
approach we had not observ but whose face i saw as she went by and
thought i had a faint remembr of she wa lightli dress look
bold and haggard and flaunt and poor but seem for the time to
have given all that to the wind which wa blow and to have noth
in her mind but go after them as the dark distant level absorb
their figur into itself left but itself visibl between us and the
sea and cloud her figur disappear in like manner still no nearer
to them than befor
that is a black shadow to be follow the girl said steerforth
stand still what doe it mean
he spoke in a low voic that sound almost strang to me
she must have it in her mind to beg of them i think said i
a beggar would be no novelti said steerforth but it is a strang
thing that the beggar should take that shape tonight
why i ask
for no better reason truli than becaus i wa think he said
after a paus of someth like it when it came by where the devil
did it come from i wonder
from the shadow of thi wall i think said i as we emerg upon a
road on which a wall abut
it gone he return look over hi shoulder and all ill go
with it now for our dinner
but he look again over hi shoulder toward the sealin glimmer
afar off and yet again and he wonder about it in some broken
express sever time in the short remaind of our walk and onli
seem to forget it when the light of fire and candl shone upon us
seat warm and merri at tabl
littim wa there and had hi usual effect upon me when i said to
him that i hope mr steerforth and miss dartl were well he answer
respectfulli and of cours respect that thei were toler well

chapter 23 i corrobor mr dick and choos a profess
when i awok in the morn i thought veri much of littl emli and her
emot last night after martha had left i felt as if i had come into
the knowledg of those domest weak and tender in a sacr
confid and that to disclos them even to steerforth would be
wrong i had no gentler feel toward anyon than toward the
pretti creatur who had been my playmat and whom i have alwai been
persuad and shall alwai be persuad to my dy dai i then
devotedli love the repetit to ani earseven to steerforthsof
what she had been unabl to repress when her heart lai open to me by an
accid i felt would be a rough deed unworthi of myself unworthi of
the light of our pure childhood which i alwai saw encircl her head
i made a resolut therefor to keep it in my own breast and there
it gave her imag a new grace
while we were at breakfast a letter wa deliv to me from my aunt
as it contain matter on which i thought steerforth could advis me
as well as anyon and on which i knew i should be delight to consult
him i resolv to make it a subject of discuss on our journei home
for the present we had enough to do in take leav of all our friend
mr barki wa far from be the last among them in hi regret at
our departur and i believ would even have open the box again and
sacrif anoth guinea if it would have kept us eightandforti
hour in yarmouth peggotti and all her famili were full of grief at our
go the whole hous of omer and joram turn out to bid us goodby
and there were so mani seafar volunt in attend on steerforth
when our portmanteaux went to the coach that if we had had the baggag
of a regiment with us we should hardli have want porter to carri it

silent and i be suffici engag in wonder within myself
when i should see the old place again and what new chang might
happen to me or them in the meanwhil at length steerforth becom
gai and talk in a moment as he could becom anyth he like at
ani moment pull me by the arm

befor i could let down the step my aunt sprang in i dont know how

that all confound as i wa i turn from them at onc in do so
i heard her sai to the coachman drive anywher drive straight on
and present the chariot pass me go up the hill
what mr dick had told me and what i had suppos to be a delus of
hi now came into my mind i could not doubt that thi person wa the
person of whom he had made such mysteri mention though what the
natur of hi hold upon my aunt could possibl be i wa quit unabl
to imagin after half an hour cool in the churchyard i saw the
chariot come back the driver stop besid me and my aunt wa
sit in it alon

composur when she told me she wa quit herself now and we might get
out on her give me her purs to pai the driver i found that all the
guinea were gone and onli the loos silver remain
doctor common wa approach by a littl low archwai befor we had
taken mani pace down the street beyond it the nois of the citi seem
to melt as if by magic into a soften distanc a few dull court
and narrow wai brought us to the skylight offic of spenlow and
jorkin in the vestibul of which templ access to pilgrim
without the ceremoni of knock three or four clerk were at work as
copyist on of these a littl dry man sit by himself who wore
a stiff brown wig that look as if it were made of gingerbread rose to
receiv my aunt and show us into mr spenlow room
mr spenlow in court maam said the dry man it an arch dai
but it close by and ill send for him directli
as we were left to look about us while mr spenlow wa fetch i
avail myself of the opportun the furnitur of the room wa
oldfashion and dusti and the green baiz on the top of the
writingt had lost all it colour and wa as wither and pale as
an old pauper there were a great mani bundl of paper on it some
endors as alleg and some to my surpris as libel and some
as be in the consistori court and some in the arch court and some
in the prerog court and some in the admiralti court and some in
the deleg court give me occas to wonder much how mani court
there might be in the gross and how long it would take to understand
them all besid these there were sundri immens manuscript book
of evid taken on affidavit strongli bound and ti togeth in
massiv set a set to each caus as if everi caus were a histori in
ten or twenti volum all thi look toler expens i thought
and gave me an agreeabl notion of a proctor busi i wa cast
my ey with increas complac over these and mani similar object
when hasti footstep were heard in the room outsid and mr spenlow
in a black gown trim with white fur came hurri in take off hi
hat as he came
he wa a littl lighthair gentleman with undeni boot and the
stiffest of white cravat and shirtcollar he wa button up mighti
trim and tight and must have taken a great deal of pain with hi
whisker which were accur curl hi gold watchchain wa so
massiv that a fanci came across me that he ought to have a sinewi
golden arm to draw it out with like those which ar put up over the
goldbeat shop he wa got up with such care and wa so stiff that
he could hardli bend himself be oblig when he glanc at some
paper on hi desk after sit down in hi chair to move hi whole
bodi from the bottom of hi spine like punch
i had previous been present by my aunt and had been courteous
receiv he now said
and so mr copperfield you think of enter into our profess
i casual mention to miss trotwood when i had the pleasur of an
interview with her the other daywith anoth inclin of hi
bodypunch againthat there wa a vacanc here miss trotwood wa
good enough to mention that she had a nephew who wa her peculiar care
and for whom she wa seek to provid genteelli in life that
nephew i believ i have now the pleasur ofpunch again i bow my
acknowledg and said my aunt had mention to me that there wa
that open and that i believ i should like it veri much that i wa
strongli inclin to like it and had taken immedi to the propos
that i could not absolut pledg myself to like it until i knew
someth more about it that although it wa littl els than a matter
of form i presum i should have an opportun of try how i like
it befor i bound myself to it irrevoc
oh sure sure said mr spenlow we alwai in thi hous
propos a monthan initiatori month i should be happi myself to
propos two monthsthreean indefinit period in factbut i have a
partner mr jorkin
and the premium sir i return is a thousand pound
and the premium stamp includ is a thousand pound said mr
spenlow as i have mention to miss trotwood i am actuat by no
mercenari consider few men ar less so i believ but mr
jorkin ha hi opinion on these subject and i am bound to respect
mr jorkinss opinion mr jorkin think a thousand pound too littl
in short
i suppos sir said i still desir to spare my aunt that it is
not the custom here if an articl clerk were particularli us
and made himself a perfect master of hi professioni could not help
blush thi look so like prais myselfi suppos it is not the
custom in the later year of hi time to allow him ani
mr spenlow by a great effort just lift hi head far enough out of
hi cravat to shake it and answer anticip the word salari
no i will not sai what consider i might give to that point
myself mr copperfield if i were unfett mr jorkin is
immov
i wa quit dismai by the idea of thi terribl jorkin but i found
out afterward that he wa a mild man of a heavi tempera whose
place in the busi wa to keep himself in the background and be
constantli exhibit by name as the most obdur and ruthless of men
if a clerk want hi salari rais mr jorkin wouldnt listen to such
a proposit if a client were slow to settl hi bill of cost mr
jorkin wa resolv to have it paid and howev pain these thing
might be and alwai were to the feel of mr spenlow mr jorkin
would have hi bond the heart and hand of the good angel spenlow would
have been alwai open but for the restrain demon jorkin as i have
grown older i think i have had experi of some other hous do
busi on the principl of spenlow and jorkin
it wa settl that i should begin my month probat as soon as i
pleas and that my aunt need neither remain in town nor return at
it expir as the articl of agreement of which i wa to be the
subject could easili be sent to her at home for her signatur when
we had got so far mr spenlow offer to take me into court then and
there and show me what sort of place it wa as i wa will enough
to know we went out with thi object leav my aunt behind who would
trust herself she said in no such place and who i think regard
all court of law as a sort of powdermil that might blow up at ani
time
mr spenlow conduct me through a pave courtyard form of grave brick
hous which i infer from the doctor name upon the door to be
the offici abidingplac of the learn advoc of whom steerforth
had told me and into a larg dull room not unlik a chapel to my
think on the left hand the upper part of thi room wa fenc off
from the rest and there on the two side of a rais platform of the
horsesho form sit on easi oldfashion diningroom chair were
sundri gentlemen in red gown and grei wig whom i found to be the
doctor aforesaid blink over a littl desk like a pulpitdesk in
the curv of the horsesho wa an old gentleman whom if i had seen
him in an aviari i should certainli have taken for an owl but who i
learn wa the presid judg in the space within the horsesho
lower than these that is to sai on about the level of the floor were
sundri other gentlemen of mr spenlow rank and dress like him in
black gown with white fur upon them sit at a long green tabl
their cravat were in gener stiff i thought and their look haughti
but in thi last respect i present conceiv i had done them an
injustic for when two or three of them had to rise and answer a
question of the presid dignitari i never saw anyth more sheepish
the public repres by a boi with a comfort and a shabbygenteel
man secretli eat crumb out of hi coat pocket wa warm itself
at a stove in the centr of the court the languid still of the
place wa onli broken by the chirp of thi fire and by the voic of
on of the doctor who wa wander slowli through a perfect librari
of evid and stop to put up from time to time at littl
roadsid inn of argument on the journei altogeth i have never
on ani occas made on at such a cosei dosei oldfashion
timeforgotten sleepyhead littl familyparti in all my life and
i felt it would be quit a sooth opiat to belong to it in ani
characterexcept perhap as a suitor
veri well satisfi with the dreami natur of thi retreat i inform
mr spenlow that i had seen enough for that time and we rejoin
my aunt in compani with whom i present depart from the common
feel veri young when i went out of spenlow and jorkinss on account
of the clerk poke on anoth with their pen to point me out
we arriv at lincoln inn field without ani new adventur except

wonderfulli fine thing to walk about town with the kei of my hous in my
pocket and to know that i could ask ani fellow to come home and make
quit sure of it be inconveni to nobodi if it were not so to me
it wa a wonderfulli fine thing to let myself in and out and to come
and go without a word to anyon and to ring mr crupp up gasp
from the depth of the earth when i want herand when she wa
dispos to come all thi i sai wa wonderfulli fine but i must sai
too that there were time when it wa veri dreari
it wa fine in the morn particularli in the fine morn it look
a veri fresh free life by daylight still fresher and more free by
sunlight but as the dai declin the life seem to go down too i
dont know how it wa it seldom look well by candlelight i want
somebodi to talk to then i miss agn i found a tremend blank
in the place of that smile repositori of my confid mr crupp
appear to be a long wai off i thought about my predecessor who had
di of drink and smoke and i could have wish he had been so good as
to live and not bother me with hi deceas
after two dai and night i felt as if i had live there for a year
and yet i wa not an hour older but wa quit as much torment by my
own youth as ever
steerforth not yet appear which induc me to apprehend that he must
be ill i left the common earli on the third dai and walk out to
highgat mr steerforth wa veri glad to see me and said that he had
gone awai with on of hi oxford friend to see anoth who live near
st alban but that she expect him to return tomorrow i wa so fond
of him that i felt quit jealou of hi oxford friend
as she press me to stai to dinner i remain and i believ we talk
about noth but him all dai i told her how much the peopl like him
at yarmouth and what a delight companion he had been miss dartl
wa full of hint and mysteri question but took a great interest
in all our proceed there and said wa it realli though and so
forth so often that she got everyth out of me she want to know
her appear wa exactli what i have describ it when i first saw
her but the societi of the two ladi wa so agreeabl and came so
natur to me that i felt myself fall a littl in love with her i
could not help think sever time in the cours of the even and
particularli when i walk home at night what delight compani she
would be in buckingham street
i wa take my coffe and roll in the morn befor go to the
commonsand i mai observ in thi place that it is surpris how
much coffe mr crupp us and how weak it wa consideringwhen
steerforth himself walk in to my unbound joi
my dear steerforth cri i i began to think i should never see you

realli ought to have a littl housewarm and that there never
could be a better opportun i had a new pride in my room after
hi approv of them and burn with a desir to develop their utmost
resourc i therefor made him promis posit in the name of hi
two friend and we appoint six oclock as the dinnerhour
when he wa gone i rang for mr crupp and acquaint her with my
desper design mr crupp said in the first place of cours it wa
well known she couldnt be expect to wait but she knew a handi young
man who she thought could be prevail upon to do it and whose term
would be five shill and what i pleas i said certainli we would
have him next mr crupp said it wa clear she couldnt be in two
place at onc which i felt to be reason and that a young gal
station in the pantri with a bedroom candl there never to desist
from wash plate would be indispens i said what would be
the expens of thi young femal and mr crupp said she suppos
eighteenp would neither make me nor break me i said i suppos not
and that wa settl then mr crupp said now about the dinner
it wa a remark instanc of want of forethought on the part of the
ironmong who had made mr crupp kitchen fireplac that it wa
capabl of cook noth but chop and mash potato as to a
fishkittl mr crupp said well would i onli come and look at the
rang she couldnt sai fairer than that would i come and look at
it as i should not have been much the wiser if i had look at it i
declin and said never mind fish but mr crupp said dont sai
that oyster wa in why not them so that wa settl mr crupp
then said what she would recommend would be thi a pair of hot
roast fowlsfrom the pastrycook a dish of stew beef with
vegetablesfrom the pastrycook two littl corner thing as a
rais pie and a dish of kidneysfrom the pastrycook a tart and if
i like a shape of jellyfrom the pastrycook thi mr crupp said
would leav her at full liberti to concentr her mind on the potato
and to serv up the chees and celeri as she could wish to see it done
i act on mr crupp opinion and gave the order at the pastrycook
myself walk along the strand afterward and observ a hard
mottl substanc in the window of a ham and beef shop which resembl
marbl but wa label mock turtl i went in and bought a slab of
it which i have sinc seen reason to believ would have suffic for
fifteen peopl thi prepar mr crupp after some difficulti
consent to warm up and it shrunk so much in a liquid state that we
found it what steerforth call rather a tight fit for four
these prepar happili complet i bought a littl dessert in
covent garden market and gave a rather extens order at a retail
winemerch in that vicin when i came home in the afternoon and
saw the bottl drawn up in a squar on the pantri floor thei look
so numer though there were two miss which made mr crupp veri
uncomfort that i wa absolut frighten at them
on of steerforth friend wa name grainger and the other markham
thei were both veri gai and live fellow grainger someth older
than steerforth markham youthfullook and i should sai not
more than twenti i observ that the latter alwai spoke of himself
indefinit as a man and seldom or never in the first person
singular
a man might get on veri well here mr copperfield said
markhammean himself

commodi

we did not spare the wine and he exert himself so brilliantli to make
the thing pass off well that there wa no paus in our festiv i wa
not quit such good compani dure dinner as i could have wish to be
for my chair wa opposit the door and my attent wa distract by
observ that the handi young man went out of the room veri often and
that hi shadow alwai present itself immedi afterward on the
wall of the entri with a bottl at it mouth the young gal likewis
occas me some uneasi not so much by neglect to wash the
plate as by break them for be of an inquisit disposit
and unabl to confin herself as her posit instruct were to the
pantri she wa constantli peer in at us and constantli imagin
herself detect in which belief she sever time retir upon the
plate with which she had carefulli pave the floor and did a great
deal of destruct
these howev were small drawback and easili forgotten when the
cloth wa clear and the dessert put on the tabl at which period of
the entertain the handi young man wa discov to be speechless

chapter 25 good and bad angel
i wa go out at my door on the morn after that deplor dai of
headach sick and repent with an odd confus in my mind
rel to the date of my dinnerparti as if a bodi of titan had
taken an enorm lever and push the dai befor yesterdai some month
back when i saw a ticketport come upstair with a letter in hi
hand he wa take hi time about hi errand then but when he saw me
on the top of the staircas look at him over the banist he swung
into a trot and came up pant as if he had run himself into a state
of exhaust
t copperfield esquir said the ticketport touch hi hat with
hi littl cane
i could scarc lai claim to the name i wa so disturb by the
convict that the letter came from agn howev i told him i wa t
copperfield esquir and he believ it and gave me the letter which
he said requir an answer i shut him out on the land to wait for
the answer and went into my chamber again in such a nervou state
that i wa fain to lai the letter down on my breakfast tabl and
familiar myself with the outsid of it a littl befor i could
resolv to break the seal
i found when i did open it that it wa a veri kind note contain
no refer to my condit at the theatr all it said wa my dear
trotwood i am stai at the hous of papa agent mr waterbrook in
eli place holborn will you come and see me todai at ani time you like
to appoint ever your affection agn
it took me such a long time to write an answer at all to my
satisfact that i dont know what the ticketport can have
thought unless he thought i wa learn to write i must have written
halfadozen answer at least i began on how can i ever hope
my dear agn to effac from your remembr the disgust
impressionther i didnt like it and then i tore it up i began
anoth shakespear ha observ my dear agn how strang it is
that a man should put an enemi into hi mouththat remind me of
markham and it got no farther i even tri poetri i began on note
in a sixsyl line oh do not rememberbut that associ
itself with the fifth of novemb and becam an absurd after mani
attempt i wrote my dear agn your letter is like you and what
could i sai of it that would be higher prais than that i will come at
four oclock affection and sorrowfulli tc with thi missiv
which i wa in twenti mind at onc about recal as soon as it wa
out of my hand the ticketport at last depart
if the dai were half as tremend to ani other profession gentleman
in doctor common as it wa to me i sincer believ he made some
expiat for hi share in that rotten old ecclesiast chees
although i left the offic at half past three and wa prowl about
the place of appoint within a few minut afterward the appoint
time wa exceed by a full quarter of an hour accord to the
clock of st andrew holborn befor i could muster up suffici
desper to pull the privat bellhandl let into the lefthand
doorpost of mr waterbrook hous
the profession busi of mr waterbrook establish wa done on
the groundfloor and the genteel busi of which there wa a good
deal in the upper part of the build i wa shown into a pretti but
rather close drawingroom and there sat agn net a purs
she look so quiet and good and remind me so strongli of my airi
fresh school dai at canterburi and the sodden smoki stupid wretch
i had been the other night that nobodi be by i yield to my
selfreproach and shame andin short made a fool of myself i cannot
deni that i shed tear to thi hour i am undecid whether it wa upon
the whole the wisest thing i could have done or the most ridicul
if it had been anyon but you agn said i turn awai my head i
should not have mind it half so much but that it should have been you
who saw me i almost wish i had been dead first
she put her handit touch wa like no other handupon my arm for a
moment and i felt so befriend and comfort that i could not help
move it to my lip and gratefulli kiss it

be so when thei ar put togeth i judg him partli from your account
of him trotwood and your charact and the influenc he ha over
you
there wa alwai someth in her modest voic that seem to touch a
chord within me answer to that sound alon it wa alwai earnest
but when it wa veri earnest as it wa now there wa a thrill in it
that quit subdu me i sat look at her as she cast her ey down on
her work i sat seem still to listen to her and steerforth in spite
of all my attach to him darken in that tone
it is veri bold in me said agn look up again who have live
in such seclus and can know so littl of the world to give you my
advic so confid or even to have thi strong opinion but i know
in what it is engend trotwoodin how true a remembr of our

to you it is that which make me bold i am certain that what i sai is

friend
again i look at her again i listen to her after she wa silent and
again hi imag though it wa still fix in my heart darken
i am not so unreason as to expect said agn resum her usual
tone after a littl while that you will or that you can at onc
chang ani sentiment that ha becom a convict to you least of all
a sentiment that is root in your trust disposit you ought not
hastili to do that i onli ask you trotwood if you ever think of mei

confid as of old
and when agn said i will you forgiv me the other night
when i recal it said agn
she would have dismiss the subject so but i wa too full of it to
allow that and insist on tell her how it happen that i had
disgrac myself and what chain of accident circumst had had the
theatr for it final link it wa a great relief to me to do thi and
to enlarg on the oblig that i ow to steerforth for hi care of

throat and a good deal of shirtcollar who onli want a black nose to
be the portrait of a pugdog he told me he wa happi to have the
honour of make my acquaint and when i had paid my homag to mr
waterbrook present me with much ceremoni to a veri aw ladi in
a black velvet dress and a great black velvet hat whom i rememb as
look like a near relat of hamletssai hi aunt

too so cold a man that hi head instead of be grei seem to
be sprinkl with hoarfrost immens defer wa shown to the henri
spiker male and femal which agn told me wa on account of mr
henri spiker be solicitor to someth or to somebodi i forget what
or which remot connect with the treasuri
i found uriah heep among the compani in a suit of black and in deep
humil he told me when i shook hand with him that he wa proud
to be notic by me and that he realli felt oblig to me for my
condescens i could have wish he had been less oblig to me for
he hover about me in hi gratitud all the rest of the even and
whenev i said a word to agn wa sure with hi shadowless ey and
cadaver face to be look gauntli down upon us from behind
there were other guestsal ic for the occas as it struck me
like the wine but there wa on who attract my attent befor he
came in on account of my hear him announc as mr traddl my mind
flew back to salem hous and could it be tommi i thought who us to
draw the skeleton
i look for mr traddl with unusu interest he wa a sober
steadylook young man of retir manner with a comic head of hair
and ey that were rather wide open and he got into an obscur corner
so soon that i had some difficulti in make him out at length i had
a good view of him and either my vision deceiv me or it wa the old
unfortun tommi
i made my wai to mr waterbrook and said that i believ i had the
pleasur of see an old schoolfellow there
inde said mr waterbrook surpris you ar too young to have
been at school with mr henri spiker
oh i dont mean him i return i mean the gentleman name
traddl
oh ay ay inde said my host with much diminish interest
possibl
if it realli the same person said i glanc toward him it
wa at a place call salem hous where we were togeth and he wa an
excel fellow
oh ye traddl is a good fellow return my host nod hi head
with an air of toler traddl is quit a good fellow
it a curiou coincid said i
it is realli return my host quit a coincid that traddl
should be here at all as traddl wa onli invit thi morn when
the place at tabl intend to be occupi by mr henri spiker
brother becam vacant in consequ of hi indisposit a veri
gentlemanli man mr henri spiker brother mr copperfield
i murmur an assent which wa full of feel consid that i
knew noth at all about him and i inquir what mr traddl wa by
profess
traddl return mr waterbrook is a young man read for the
bar ye he is quit a good fellownobodi enemi but hi own
is he hi own enemi said i sorri to hear thi
well return mr waterbrook purs up hi mouth and plai with
hi watchchain in a comfort prosper sort of wai i should sai
he wa on of those men who stand in their own light ye i should sai
he would never for exampl be worth five hundr pound traddl wa
recommend to me by a profession friend oh ye ye he ha a kind
of talent for draw brief and state a case in write plainli i
am abl to throw someth in traddless wai in the cours of the year
somethingfor himconsider oh ye ye
i wa much impress by the extrem comfort and satisfi manner
in which mr waterbrook deliv himself of thi littl word ye
everi now and then there wa wonder express in it it complet
convei the idea of a man who had been born not to sai with a silver
spoon but with a scalingladd and had gone on mount all the
height of life on after anoth until now he look from the top of
the fortif with the ey of a philosoph and a patron on the
peopl down in the trench
my reflect on thi theme were still in progress when dinner wa
announc mr waterbrook went down with hamlet aunt mr henri spiker
took mr waterbrook agn whom i should have like to take myself
wa given to a simper fellow with weak leg uriah traddl and i
as the junior part of the compani went down last how we could i wa
not so vex at lose agn as i might have been sinc it gave me
an opportun of make myself known to traddl on the stair who
greet me with great fervour while uriah writh with such obtrus
satisfact and selfabas that i could gladli have pitch
him over the banist traddl and i were separ at tabl be
billet in two remot corner he in the glare of a red velvet ladi
i in the gloom of hamlet aunt the dinner wa veri long and the
convers wa about the aristocracyand blood mr waterbrook
repeatedli told us that if she had a weak it wa blood
it occur to me sever time that we should have got on better if we
had not been quit so genteel we were so exceedingli genteel that our
scope wa veri limit a mr and mr gulpidg were of the parti who
had someth to do at secondhand at least mr gulpidg had with
the law busi of the bank and what with the bank and what with
the treasuri we were as exclus as the court circular to mend the
matter hamlet aunt had the famili fail of indulg in soliloqui
and held forth in a desultori manner by herself on everi topic that
wa introduc these were few enough to be sure but as we alwai fell
back upon blood she had as wide a field for abstract specul as her
nephew himself
we might have been a parti of ogr the convers assum such a
sanguin complexion
i confess i am of mr waterbrook opinion said mr waterbrook with
hi wineglass at hi ey other thing ar all veri well in their wai
but give me blood
oh there is noth observ hamlet aunt so satisfactori to on
there is noth that is so much on beauideal ofof all that sort
of thing speak gener there ar some low mind not mani i am
happi to believ but there ar some that would prefer to do what i
should call bow down befor idol posit idol befor servic
intellect and so on but these ar intang point blood is not so
we see blood in a nose and we know it we meet with it in a chin and
we sai there it is that blood it is an actual matter of fact we
point it out it admit of no doubt
the simper fellow with the weak leg who had taken agn down
state the question more decis yet i thought
oh you know deuc take it said thi gentleman look round the
board with an imbecil smile we cant forego blood you know we must
have blood you know some young fellow you know mai be a littl
behind their station perhap in point of educ and behaviour and
mai go a littl wrong you know and get themselv and other peopl
into a varieti of fixesand all thatbut deuc take it it
delight to reflect that theyv got blood in em myself id rather
at ani time be knock down by a man who had got blood in him than id
be pick up by a man who hadnt
thi sentiment as compress the gener question into a nutshel
gave the utmost satisfact and brought the gentleman into great
notic until the ladi retir after that i observ that mr
gulpidg and mr henri spiker who had hitherto been veri distant
enter into a defens allianc against us the common enemi and
exchang a mysteri dialogu across the tabl for our defeat and
overthrow
that affair of the first bond for four thousand five hundr pound ha
not taken the cours that wa expect spiker said mr gulpidg
do you mean the d of as said mr spiker
the c of bs said mr gulpidg
mr spiker rais hi eyebrow and look much concern
when the question wa refer to lordi neednt name him said mr
gulpidg check himself
i understand said mr spiker n
mr gulpidg darkli noddedwa refer to him hi answer wa
monei or no releas
lord bless my soul cri mr spiker
monei or no releas repeat mr gulpidg firmli the next in
reversiony understand me
k said mr spiker with an omin look
k then posit refus to sign he wa attend at newmarket for
that purpos and he pointblank refus to do it
mr spiker wa so interest that he becam quit stoni
so the matter rest at thi hour said mr gulpidg throw himself
back in hi chair our friend waterbrook will excus me if i forbear to
explain myself gener on account of the magnitud of the interest
involv
mr waterbrook wa onli too happi as it appear to me to have such
interest and such name even hint at across hi tabl he assum
an express of gloomi intellig though i am persuad he knew
no more about the discuss than i did and highli approv of the
discret that had been observ mr spiker after the receipt of such
a confid natur desir to favour hi friend with a confid
of hi own therefor the forego dialogu wa succeed by anoth
in which it wa mr gulpidg turn to be surpris and that by anoth
in which the surpris came round to mr spiker turn again and so on
turn and turn about all thi time we the outsid remain oppress
by the tremend interest involv in the convers and our
host regard us with pride as the victim of a salutari aw and
astonish i wa veri glad inde to get upstair to agn and to
talk with her in a corner and to introduc traddl to her who wa
shy but agreeabl and the same goodnatur creatur still as he
wa oblig to leav earli on account of go awai next morn for
a month i had not nearli so much convers with him as i could have
wish but we exchang address and promis ourselv the pleasur
of anoth meet when he should come back to town he wa greatli
interest to hear that i knew steerforth and spoke of him with such
warmth that i made him tell agn what he thought of him but agn onli
look at me the while and veri slightli shook her head when onli i
observ her
as she wa not among peopl with whom i believ she could be veri much
at home i wa almost glad to hear that she wa go awai within a few
dai though i wa sorri at the prospect of part from her again
so soon thi caus me to remain until all the compani were gone
convers with her and hear her sing wa such a delight
remind to me of my happi life in the grave old hous she had made so
beauti that i could have remain there half the night but have
no excus for stai ani longer when the light of mr waterbrook
societi were all snuf out i took my leav veri much against my
inclin i felt then more than ever that she wa my better angel
and if i thought of her sweet face and placid smile as though thei had
shone on me from some remov be like an angel i hope i thought no
harm
i have said that the compani were all gone but i ought to have except
uriah whom i dont includ in that denomin and who had never
ceas to hover near us he wa close behind me when i went downstair
he wa close besid me when i walk awai from the hous slowli
fit hi long skeleton finger into the still longer finger of a
great gui fawk pair of glove

i could not help be rather short with him but he appear not to
mind it we went the nearest wai without convers much upon the road
and he wa so humbl in respect of those scarecrow glove that he
wa still put them on and seem to have made no advanc in that
labour when we got to my place
i led him up the dark stair to prevent hi knock hi head against
anyth and realli hi damp cold hand felt so like a frog in mine
that i wa tempt to drop it and run awai agn and hospit
prevail howev and i conduct him to my firesid when i light

level of lowwat mark sooth in her slumber by the tick of an
incorrig clock to which she alwai refer me when we had ani
littl differ on the score of punctual and which wa never less
than threequart of an hour too slow and had alwai been put right

in my bewild condit had the least effect upon hi modesti
in induc him to accept my bedroom i wa oblig to make the best
arrang i could for hi repos befor the fire the mattress of

ey and of her father look fondli on her as i had so often seen
him look aros befor me with appeal face and fill me with vagu
terror when i awok the recollect that uriah wa ly in the next
room sat heavi on me like a wake nightmar and oppress me with a
leaden dread as if i had had some meaner qualiti of devil for a lodger
the poker got into my doze thought besid and wouldnt come out i
thought between sleep and wake that it wa still red hot and i
had snatch it out of the fire and run him through the bodi i wa so
haunt at last by the idea though i knew there wa noth in it that
i stole into the next room to look at him there i saw him ly on hi
back with hi leg extend to i dont know where gurgl take
place in hi throat stoppag in hi nose and hi mouth open like
a postoffic he wa so much wors in realiti than in my distemp
fanci that afterward i wa attract to him in veri repuls and
could not help wander in and out everi halfhour or so and take
anoth look at him still the long long night seem heavi and
hopeless as ever and no promis of dai wa in the murki sky
when i saw him go downstair earli in the morn for thank heaven

agn wa of cours insid but what i underw in my effort to be
friendli with him while agn look on perhap deserv that littl
recompens at the coach window as at the dinnerparti he hover
about us without a moment intermiss like a great vultur gorg
himself on everi syllabl that i said to agn or agn said to me
in the state of troubl into which hi disclosur by my fire had thrown
me i had thought veri much of the word agn had us in refer to
the partnership i did what i hope wa right feel sure that it
wa necessari for papa peac that the sacrific should be made i
entreat him to make it a miser forebod that she would
yield to and sustain herself by the same feel in refer to ani
sacrific for hi sake had oppress me ever sinc i knew how she
love him i knew what the devot of her natur wa i knew from her
own lip that she regard herself as the innoc caus of hi error
and as ow him a great debt she ardent desir to pai i had no
consol in see how differ she wa from thi detest rufu
with the mulberrycolour greatcoat for i felt that in the veri
differ between them in the selfdeni of her pure soul and the
sordid base of hi the greatest danger lai all thi doubtless he
knew thoroughli and had in hi cun consid well
yet i wa so certain that the prospect of such a sacrific afar off
must destroi the happi of agn and i wa so sure from her manner
of it be unseen by her then and have cast no shadow on her yet
that i could as soon have injur her as given her ani warn of what
impend thu it wa that we part without explan she wave
her hand and smile farewel from the coach window her evil geniu
writh on the roof as if he had her in hi clutch and triumph
i could not get over thi farewel glimps of them for a long time when
agn wrote to tell me of her safe arriv i wa as miser as when
i saw her go awai whenev i fell into a thought state thi
subject wa sure to present itself and all my uneasi wa sure to be
redoubl hardli a night pass without my dream of it it becam a
part of my life and as insepar from my life as my own head
i had ampl leisur to refin upon my uneasi for steerforth wa at
oxford as he wrote to me and when i wa not at the common i wa
veri much alon i believ i had at thi time some lurk distrust of
steerforth i wrote to him most affection in repli to hi but i
think i wa glad upon the whole that he could not come to london just
then i suspect the truth to be that the influenc of agn wa upon
me undisturb by the sight of him and that it wa the more power
with me becaus she had so larg a share in my thought and interest
in the meantim dai and week slip awai i wa articl to spenlow
and jorkin i had nineti pound a year exclus of my houser
and sundri collater matter from my aunt my room were engag
for twelv month certain and though i still found them dreari of an
even and the even long i could settl down into a state of
equabl low spirit and resign myself to coffe which i seem on
look back to have taken by the gallon at about thi period of my
exist at about thi time too i made three discoveri first
that mr crupp wa a martyr to a curiou disord call the
spazzum which wa gener accompani with inflamm of the
nose and requir to be constantli treat with peppermint secondli
that someth peculiar in the temperatur of my pantri made the
brandybottl burst thirdli that i wa alon in the world and much
given to record that circumst in fragment of english versif
on the dai when i wa articl no festiv took place beyond my
have sandwich and sherri into the offic for the clerk and go
alon to the theatr at night i went to see the stranger as a doctor
common sort of plai and wa so dreadfulli cut up that i hardli knew
myself in my own glass when i got home mr spenlow remark on thi
occas when we conclud our busi that he should have been
happi to have seen me at hi hous at norwood to celebr our becom
connect but for hi domest arrang be in some disord
on account of the expect return of hi daughter from finish her
educ at pari but he intim that when she came home he should
hope to have the pleasur of entertain me i knew that he wa a
widow with on daughter and express my acknowledg
mr spenlow wa as good as hi word in a week or two he refer to
thi engag and said that if i would do him the favour to come
down next saturdai and stai till mondai he would be extrem happi
of cours i said i would do him the favour and he wa to drive me down
in hi phaeton and to bring me back
when the dai arriv my veri carpetbag wa an object of vener
to the stipendiari clerk to whom the hous at norwood wa a sacr
mysteri on of them inform me that he had heard that mr spenlow
at entir off plate and china and anoth hint at champagn be
constantli on draught after the usual custom of tableb the old
clerk with the wig whose name wa mr tiffei had been down on busi
sever time in the cours of hi career and had on each occas
penetr to the breakfastparlour he describ it as an apart of
the most sumptuou natur and said that he had drunk brown east india
sherri there of a qualiti so preciou as to make a man wink we had
an adjourn caus in the consistori that dayabout excommun a
baker who had been object in a vestri to a pavingrateand as the
evid wa just twice the length of robinson cruso accord to a
calcul i made it wa rather late in the dai befor we finish
howev we got him excommun for six week and sentenc in
no end of cost and then the baker proctor and the judg and the
advoc on both side who were all nearli relat went out of town
togeth and mr spenlow and i drove awai in the phaeton
the phaeton wa a veri handsom affair the hors arch their neck
and lift up their leg as if thei knew thei belong to doctor
common there wa a good deal of competit in the common on all
point of displai and it turn out some veri choic equipag then
though i alwai have consid and alwai shall consid that in my
time the great articl of competit there wa starch which i think
wa worn among the proctor to as great an extent as it is in the natur
of man to bear
we were veri pleasant go down and mr spenlow gave me some hint in
refer to my profess he said it wa the genteelest profess in
the world and must on no account be confound with the profess of a
solicitor be quit anoth sort of thing infinit more exclus
less mechan and more profit we took thing much more easili
in the common than thei could be taken anywher els he observ and
that set us as a privileg class apart he said it wa imposs
to conceal the disagre fact that we were chiefli emploi by
solicitor but he gave me to understand that thei were an inferior race
of men univers look down upon by all proctor of ani pretens
i ask mr spenlow what he consid the best sort of profession
busi he repli that a good case of a disput will where there
wa a neat littl estat of thirti or forti thousand pound wa
perhap the best of all in such a case he said not onli were there
veri pretti pick in the wai of argument at everi stage of the
proceed and mountain upon mountain of evid on interrogatori
and counterinterrogatori to sai noth of an appeal ly first to
the deleg and then to the lord but the cost be pretti sure
to come out of the estat at last both side went at it in a live
and spirit manner and expens wa no consider then he launch
into a gener eulogium on the common what wa to be particularli
admir he said in the common wa it compact it wa the most
conveni organ place in the world it wa the complet idea of
snug it lai in a nutshel for exampl you brought a divorc case
or a restitut case into the consistori veri good you tri it in
the consistori you made a quiet littl round game of it among a famili
group and you plai it out at leisur suppos you were not satisfi
with the consistori what did you do then why you went into the
arch what wa the arch the same court in the same room with the
same bar and the same practition but anoth judg for there the
consistori judg could plead ani courtdai as an advoc well you
plai your round game out again still you were not satisfi veri
good what did you do then why you went to the deleg who were the
deleg why the ecclesiast deleg were the advoc without
ani busi who had look on at the round game when it wa plai in
both court and had seen the card shuffl and cut and plai and
had talk to all the player about it and now came fresh as judg
to settl the matter to the satisfact of everybodi discont
peopl might talk of corrupt in the common close in the
common and the necess of reform the common said mr spenlow
solemnli in conclus but when the price of wheat per bushel had been
highest the common had been busiest and a man might lai hi hand upon
hi heart and sai thi to the whole worldtouch the common and
down come the countri
i listen to all thi with attent and though i must sai i had my
doubt whether the countri wa quit as much oblig to the common as
mr spenlow made out i respectfulli defer to hi opinion that
about the price of wheat per bushel i modestli felt wa too much for
my strength and quit settl the question i have never to thi hour
got the better of that bushel of wheat it ha reappear to annihil
me all through my life in connexion with all kind of subject i
dont know now exactli what it ha to do with me or what right it ha
to crush me on an infinit varieti of occas but whenev i see my
old friend the bushel brought in by the head and shoulder as he alwai
is i observ i give up a subject for lost
thi is a digress i wa not the man to touch the common and
bring down the countri i submiss express by my silenc my
acquiesc in all i had heard from my superior in year and knowledg
and we talk about the stranger and the drama and the pair of hors
until we came to mr spenlow gate
there wa a love garden to mr spenlow hous and though that wa
not the best time of the year for see a garden it wa so beautifulli
kept that i wa quit enchant there wa a charm lawn there were
cluster of tree and there were perspect walk that i could just
distinguish in the dark arch over with trelliswork on which shrub
and flower grew in the grow season here miss spenlow walk by
herself i thought dear me
we went into the hous which wa cheerfulli light up and into a hall
where there were all sort of hat cap greatcoat plaid glove
whip and walkingstick where is miss dora said mr spenlow to the
servant dora i thought what a beauti name
we turn into a room near at hand i think it wa the ident
breakfastroom made memor by the brown east indian sherri and i
heard a voic sai mr copperfield my daughter dora and my daughter
dora confidenti friend it wa no doubt mr spenlow voic
but i didnt know it and i didnt care whose it wa all wa over in a
moment i had fulfil my destini i wa a captiv and a slave i love
dora spenlow to distract
she wa more than human to me she wa a fairi a sylph i dont
know what she wasanyth that no on ever saw and everyth that
everybodi ever want i wa swallow up in an abyss of love in an
instant there wa no paus on the brink no look down or look
back i wa gone headlong befor i had sens to sai a word to her
i observ a wellrememb voic when i had bow and murmur
someth have seen mr copperfield befor
the speaker wa not dora no the confidenti friend miss murdston
i dont think i wa much astonish to the best of my judgement
no capac of astonish wa left in me there wa noth worth
mention in the materi world but dora spenlow to be astonish
about i said how do you do miss murdston i hope you ar well she
answer veri well i said how is mr murdston she repli my
brother is robust i am oblig to you
mr spenlow who i suppos had been surpris to see us recogn each
other then put in hi word

mr copperfield and myself said miss murdston with sever
composur ar connexion we were onc slightli acquaint it wa in
hi childish dai circumst have separ us sinc i should not
have known him
i repli that i should have known her anywher which wa true enough
miss murdston ha had the good said mr spenlow to me to
accept the officeif i mai so describ itof my daughter dora
confidenti friend my daughter dora have unhappili no mother miss
murdston is oblig enough to becom her companion and protector
a pass thought occur to me that miss murdston like the pocket
instrument call a lifepreserv wa not so much design for
purpos of protect as of assault but as i had none but pass
thought for ani subject save dora i glanc at her directli
afterward and wa think that i saw in her prettili pettish manner
that she wa not veri much inclin to be particularli confidenti to
her companion and protector when a bell rang which mr spenlow said
wa the first dinnerbel and so carri me off to dress
the idea of dress on self or do anyth in the wai of action
in that state of love wa a littl too ridicul i could onli sit
down befor my fire bite the kei of my carpetbag and think of the
captiv girlish brightei love dora what a form she had what
a face she had what a grace variabl enchant manner
the bell rang again so soon that i made a mere scrambl of my dress
instead of the care oper i could have wish under the
circumst and went downstair there wa some compani dora wa
talk to an old gentleman with a grei head grei as he wasand a
greatgrandfath into the bargain for he said soi wa madli jealou
of him
what a state of mind i wa in i wa jealou of everybodi i couldnt
bear the idea of anybodi know mr spenlow better than i did it wa
tortur to me to hear them talk of occurr in which i had had no
share when a most amiabl person with a highli polish bald head
ask me across the dinner tabl if that were the first occas of my
see the ground i could have done anyth to him that wa savag
and reveng
i dont rememb who wa there except dora i have not the least idea
what we had for dinner besid dora my impress is that i dine off
dora entir and sent awai halfadozen plate untouch i sat next
to her i talk to her she had the most delight littl voic the
gayest littl laugh the pleasantest and most fascin littl
wai that ever led a lost youth into hopeless slaveri she wa rather
diminut altogeth so much the more preciou i thought
when she went out of the room with miss murdston no other ladi
were of the parti i fell into a reveri onli disturb by the cruel
apprehens that miss murdston would disparag me to her the amiabl
creatur with the polish head told me a long stori which i think wa
about garden i think i heard him sai my garden sever time
i seem to pai the deepest attent to him but i wa wander in a
garden of eden all the while with dora
my apprehens of be disparag to the object of my engross
affect were reviv when we went into the drawingroom by the grim
and distant aspect of miss murdston but i wa reliev of them in an
unexpect manner
david copperfield said miss murdston beckon me asid into a
window a word
i confront miss murdston alon
david copperfield said miss murdston i need not enlarg upon
famili circumst thei ar not a tempt subject far from it
maam i return

the memori of past differ or of past outrag i have receiv
outrag from a persona femal i am sorri to sai for the credit of my
sexwho is not to be mention without scorn and disgust and therefor
i would rather not mention her
i felt veri fieri on my aunt account but i said it would certainli be
better if miss murdston pleas not to mention her i could not hear
her disrespectfulli mention i ad without express my opinion in
a decid tone
miss murdston shut her ey and disdainfulli inclin her head then
slowli open her ey resum
david copperfield i shall not attempt to disguis the fact that i
form an unfavour opinion of you in your childhood it mai have
been a mistaken on or you mai have ceas to justifi it that is not
in question between us now i belong to a famili remark i believ
for some firm and i am not the creatur of circumst or chang
i mai have my opinion of you you mai have your opinion of me
i inclin my head in my turn
but it is not necessari said miss murdston that these opinion
should come into collis here under exist circumst it is as
well on all account that thei should not as the chanc of life have
brought us togeth again and mai bring us togeth on other occas
i would sai let us meet here as distant acquaint famili
circumst ar a suffici reason for our onli meet on that
foot and it is quit unnecessari that either of us should make the
other the subject of remark do you approv of thi
miss murdston i return i think you and mr murdston us me
veri cruelli and treat my mother with great unkind i shall
alwai think so as long as i live but i quit agre in what you

miss murdston shut her ey again and bent her head then just
touch the back of my hand with the tip of her cold stiff finger
she walk awai arrang the littl fetter on her wrist and round
her neck which seem to be the same set in exactli the same state
as when i had seen her last these remind me in refer to miss
murdston natur of the fetter over a jail door suggest on the
outsid to all behold what wa to be expect within
all i know of the rest of the even is that i heard the empress of
my heart sing enchant ballad in the french languag gener to the
effect that whatev wa the matter we ought alwai to danc ta ra
la ta ra la accompani herself on a glorifi instrument resembl
a guitar that i wa lost in bliss delirium that i refus
refresh that my soul recoil from punch particularli that when
miss murdston took her into custodi and led her awai she smile and
gave me her delici hand that i caught a view of myself in a mirror
look perfectli imbecil and idiot that i retir to bed in a most
maudlin state of mind and got up in a crisi of feebl infatu
it wa a fine morn and earli and i thought i would go and take a
stroll down on of those wirearch walk and indulg my passion by
dwell on her imag on my wai through the hall i encount her
littl dog who wa call jipshort for gipsi i approach him
tenderli for i love even him but he show hi whole set of teeth

feel of happi would be if i could ever becom engag to thi
dear wonder as to marriag and fortun and all that i believ i wa
almost as innoc undesign then as when i love littl emli to
be allow to call her dora to write to her to dote upon and worship
her to have reason to think that when she wa with other peopl she wa
yet mind of me seem to me the summit of human ambitioni am

place in the weather it wa in the state of my own feel i ad
bashfulli to clench the explan

him up in her armsoh my goodnessand caress him but he persist
upon bark still he wouldnt let me touch him when i tri and then
she beat him it increas my suffer greatli to see the pat she

if it had last ani longer i think i must have gone down on my knee
on the gravel with the probabl befor me of graze them and of
be present eject from the premis besid but by good fortun
the greenhous wa not far off and these word brought us to it
it contain quit a show of beauti geranium we loiter along in
front of them and dora often stop to admir thi on or that on
and i stop to admir the same on and dora laugh held the dog
up childishli to smell the flower and if we were not all three in
fairyland certainli i wa the scent of a geranium leaf at thi dai
strike me with a half comic half seriou wonder as to what chang ha
come over me in a moment and then i see a straw hat and blue ribbon
and a quantiti of curl and a littl black dog be held up in two
slender arm against a bank of blossom and bright leav
miss murdston had been look for us she found us here and present
her uncongeni cheek the littl wrinkl in it fill with hair
powder to dora to be kiss then she took dora arm in her and
march us into breakfast as if it were a soldier funer
how mani cup of tea i drank becaus dora made it i dont know but
i perfectli rememb that i sat swill tea until my whole nervou
system if i had had ani in those dai must have gone by the board by
and by we went to church miss murdston wa between dora and me in the
pew but i heard her sing and the congreg vanish a sermon wa
deliveredabout dora of courseand i am afraid that is all i know of
the servic
we had a quiet dai no compani a walk a famili dinner of four and an
even of look over book and pictur miss murdston with a homili
befor her and her ey upon us keep guard vigilantli ah littl
did mr spenlow imagin when he sat opposit to me after dinner that
dai with hi pockethandkerchief over hi head how fervent i wa
embrac him in my fanci as hi soninlaw littl did he think when
i took leav of him at night that he had just given hi full consent to
my be engag to dora and that i wa invok bless on hi head
we depart earli in the morn for we had a salvag case come on in
the admiralti court requir a rather accur knowledg of the whole
scienc of navig in which as we couldnt be expect to know
much about those matter in the common the judg had entreat two old
triniti master for chariti sake to come and help him out dora wa
at the breakfastt to make the tea again howev and i had the
melancholi pleasur of take off my hat to her in the phaeton as she
stood on the doorstep with jip in her arm
what the admiralti wa to me that dai what nonsens i made of our case
in my mind as i listen to it how i saw dora engrav upon the
blade of the silver oar which thei lai upon the tabl as the emblem
of that high jurisdict and how i felt when mr spenlow went home
without me i had had an insan hope that he might take me back again
as if i were a marin myself and the ship to which i belong had
sail awai and left me on a desert island i shall make no fruitless
effort to describ if that sleepi old court could rous itself and
present in ani visibl form the daydream i have had in it about dora
it would reveal my truth
i dont mean the dream that i dream on that dai alon but dai after
dai from week to week and term to term i went there not to attend to
what wa go on but to think about dora if ever i bestow a thought
upon the case as thei drag their slow length befor me it wa onli
to wonder in the matrimoni case rememb dora how it wa
that marri peopl could ever be otherwis than happi and in the
prerog case to consid if the monei in question had been left
to me what were the foremost step i should immedi have taken
in regard to dora within the first week of my passion i bought four
sumptuou waistcoatsnot for myself i had no pride in them for
doraand took to wear strawcolour kid glove in the street and
laid the foundat of all the corn i have ever had if the boot i
wore at that period could onli be produc and compar with the natur
size of my feet thei would show what the state of my heart wa in a
most affect manner
and yet wretch crippl as i made myself by thi act of homag to
dora i walk mile upon mile daili in the hope of see her not
onli wa i soon as well known on the norwood road as the postmen on that
beat but i pervad london likewis i walk about the street where
the best shop for ladi were i haunt the bazaar like an unquiet
spirit i fag through the park again and again long after i wa
quit knock up sometim at long interv and on rare occas i
saw her perhap i saw her glove wave in a carriag window perhap i
met her walk with her and miss murdston a littl wai and spoke to
her in the latter case i wa alwai veri miser afterward to think
that i had said noth to the purpos or that she had no idea of the
extent of my devot or that she care noth about me i wa alwai
look out as mai be suppos for anoth invit to mr spenlow

life of man you find me fallen back for a spring and i have everi
reason to believ that a vigor leap will shortli be the result
i wa express my satisfact when mr micawb came in a littl
more slatternli than she us to be or so she seem now to my

halfanhour talk all togeth and i ask her about the twin

mr micawb wa veri anxiou that i should stai to dinner i should not
have been avers to do so but that i imagin i detect troubl and
calcul rel to the extent of the cold meat in mr micawb
ey i therefor plead anoth engag and observ that mr
micawb spirit were immedi lighten i resist all persuas
to forego it
but i told traddl and mr and mr micawb that befor i could
think of leav thei must appoint a dai when thei would come and dine
with me the occup to which traddl stood pledg render it
necessari to fix a somewhat distant on but an appoint wa made for
the purpos that suit us all and then i took my leav
mr micawb under pretenc of show me a nearer wai than that by
which i had come accompani me to the corner of the street be
anxiou he explain to me to sai a few word to an old friend in
confid
my dear copperfield said mr micawb i need hardli tell you that
to have beneath our roof under exist circumst a mind like that
which gleamsif i mai be allow the expressionwhich gleamsin your

expos hardbak for sale in her parlourwindow dwell next door
and a bowstreet offic resid over the wai you mai imagin that hi
societi is a sourc of consol to myself and to mr micawb i
am at present my dear copperfield engag in the sale of corn upon
commiss it is not an avoc of a remun descriptionin
other word it doe not payand some temporari embarrass of a

to provid perman both for myself and for your friend traddl
in whom i have an unaffect interest you mai perhap be prepar
to hear that mr micawb is in a state of health which render it
not wholli improb that an addit mai be ultim made to those
pledg of affect whichin short to the infantin group mr
micawb famili have been so good as to express their dissatisfact
at thi state of thing i have mere to observ that i am not awar
that it is ani busi of their and that i repel that exhibit of
feel with scorn and with defianc
mr micawb then shook hand with me again and left me
chapter 28 mr micawb gauntlet
until the dai arriv on which i wa to entertain my newlyfound
old friend i live princip on dora and coffe in my lovelorn
condit my appetit languish and i wa glad of it for i felt
as though it would have been an act of perfidi toward dora to have a
natur relish for my dinner the quantiti of walk exercis i took
wa not in thi respect attend with it usual consequ as the
disappoint counteract the fresh air i have my doubt too
found on the acut experi acquir at thi period of my life
whether a sound enjoy of anim food can develop itself freeli in
ani human subject who is alwai in torment from tight boot i think
the extrem requir to be at peac befor the stomach will conduct
itself with vigour
on the occas of thi domest littl parti i did not repeat my
former extens prepar i mere provid a pair of sole
a small leg of mutton and a pigeonpi mr crupp broke out into
rebellion on my first bash hint in refer to the cook of the
fish and joint and said with a dignifi sens of injuri no no
sir you will not ask me sich a thing for you ar better acquaint
with me than to suppos me capabl of do what i cannot do with ampial
satisfact to my own feel but in the end a compromis wa
effect and mr crupp consent to achiev thi feat on condit
that i dine from home for a fortnight afterward
and here i mai remark that what i underw from mr crupp in
consequ of the tyranni she establish over me wa dread i
never wa so much afraid of anyon we made a compromis of everyth
if i hesit she wa taken with that wonder disord which wa
alwai ly in ambush in her system readi at the shortest notic to
prei upon her vital if i rang the bell impati after halfadozen
unavail modest pull and she appear at lastwhich wa not by ani
mean to be reli uponsh would appear with a reproach aspect
sink breathless on a chair near the door lai her hand upon her nankeen
bosom and becom so ill that i wa glad at ani sacrific of brandi or
anyth els to get rid of her if i object to have my bed made at
five oclock in the afternoonwhich i do still think an uncomfort
arrangementon motion of her hand toward the same nankeen region of
wound sensibl wa enough to make me falter an apolog in short
i would have done anyth in an honour wai rather than give mr
crupp offenc and she wa the terror of my life
i bought a secondhand dumbwait for thi dinnerparti in prefer
to reengag the handi young man against whom i had conceiv a
prejudic in consequ of meet him in the strand on sundai
morn in a waistcoat remark like on of mine which had been
miss sinc the former occas the young gal wa reengag but
on the stipul that she should onli bring in the dish and then
withdraw to the landingplac beyond the outer door where a habit of
snif she had contract would be lost upon the guest and where her
retir on the plate would be a physic imposs
have laid in the materi for a bowl of punch to be compound
by mr micawb have provid a bottl of lavenderwat two
waxcandl a paper of mix pin and a pincushion to assist mr
micawb in her toilett at my dressingt have also caus the
fire in my bedroom to be light for mr micawb conveni and
have laid the cloth with my own hand i await the result with
composur
at the appoint time my three visitor arriv togeth mr micawb
with more shirtcollar than usual and a new ribbon to hi eyeglass
mr micawb with her cap in a whiteybrown paper parcel traddl
carri the parcel and support mr micawb on hi arm thei were
all delight with my resid when i conduct mr micawb to my
dressingt and she saw the scale on which it wa prepar for her
she wa in such raptur that she call mr micawb to come in and
look
my dear copperfield said mr micawb thi is luxuri thi is a
wai of life which remind me of the period when i wa myself in a state
of celibaci and mr micawb had not yet been solicit to plight her
faith at the hymen altar
he mean solicit by him mr copperfield said mr micawb
archli he cannot answer for other
my dear return mr micawb with sudden serious i have no
desir to answer for other i am too well awar that when in the
inscrut decre of fate you were reserv for me it is possibl
you mai have been reserv for on destin after a protract
struggl at length to fall a victim to pecuniari involv of a
complic natur i understand your allus my love i regret it
but i can bear it
micawb exclaim mr micawb in tear have i deserv thi i
who never have desert you who never will desert you micawb my
love said mr micawb much affect you will forgiv and our old
and tri friend copperfield will i am sure forgiv the momentari
lacer of a wound spirit made sensit by a recent collis
with the minion of powerin other word with a ribald turncock
attach to the waterworksand will piti not condemn it excess
mr micawb then embrac mr micawb and press my hand leav
me to infer from thi broken allus that hi domest suppli of
water had been cut off that afternoon in consequ of default in the
payment of the compani rate
to divert hi thought from thi melancholi subject i inform mr
micawb that i reli upon him for a bowl of punch and led him to
the lemon hi recent despond not to sai despair wa gone in a
moment i never saw a man so thoroughli enjoi himself amid the fragranc
of lemonpeel and sugar the odour of burn rum and the steam of
boil water as mr micawb did that afternoon it wa wonder to
see hi face shine at us out of a thin cloud of these delic fume
as he stir and mix and tast and look as if he were make
instead of punch a fortun for hi famili down to the latest poster
as to mr micawb i dont know whether it wa the effect of the cap
or the lavenderwat or the pin or the fire or the waxcandl but
she came out of my room compar speak love and the lark
wa never gayer than that excel woman
i supposei never ventur to inquir but i supposethat mr crupp
after fry the sole wa taken ill becaus we broke down at that
point the leg of mutton came up veri red within and veri pale without
besid have a foreign substanc of a gritti natur sprinkl over
it as if if had had a fall into the ash of that remark kitchen
fireplac but we were not in condit to judg of thi fact from the
appear of the gravi forasmuch as the young gal had drop it all
upon the stairswher it remain by the by in a long train until it
wa worn out the pigeonpi wa not bad but it wa a delus pie the
crust be like a disappoint head phrenolog speak full
of lump and bump with noth particular underneath in short the
banquet wa such a failur that i should have been quit unhappyabout
the failur i mean for i wa alwai unhappi about doraif i had not
been reliev by the great good humour of my compani and by a bright
suggest from mr micawb
my dear friend copperfield said mr micawb accid will occur
in the bestregul famili and in famili not regul by that
pervad influenc which sanctifi while it enhanc theai would
sai in short by the influenc of woman in the lofti charact of
wife thei mai be expect with confid and must be born with
philosophi if you will allow me to take the liberti of remark that
there ar few comest better in their wai than a devil and that
i believ with a littl divis of labour we could accomplish a good
on if the young person in attend could produc a gridiron i would
put it to you that thi littl misfortun mai be easili repair
there wa a gridiron in the pantri on which my morn rasher of
bacon wa cook we had it in in a twinkl and immedi appli
ourselv to carri mr micawb idea into effect the divis of
labour to which he had refer wa thistraddl cut the mutton into
slice mr micawb who could do anyth of thi sort to perfect
cover them with pepper mustard salt and cayenn i put them on
the gridiron turn them with a fork and took them off under mr
micawb direct and mr micawb heat and continu stir
some mushroom ketchup in a littl saucepan when we had slice enough
done to begin upon we fellto with our sleev still tuck up at the
wrist more slice sputter and blaze on the fire and our attent
divid between the mutton on our plate and the mutton then prepar
what with the novelti of thi cookeri the excel of it the bustl
of it the frequent start up to look after it the frequent sit
down to dispos of it as the crisp slice came off the gridiron hot and
hot the be so busi so flush with the fire so amus and in the
midst of such a tempt nois and savour we reduc the leg of mutton
to the bone my own appetit came back miracul i am asham to
record it but i realli believ i forgot dora for a littl while i am
satisfi that mr and mr micawb could not have enjoi the
feast more if thei had sold a bed to provid it traddl laugh as
heartili almost the whole time as he at and work inde we all
did all at onc and i dare sai there wa never a greater success
we were at the height of our enjoy and were all busili engag in
our sever depart endeavour to bring the last batch of slice
to a state of perfect that should crown the feast when i wa awar
of a strang presenc in the room and my ey encount those of the
staid littim stand hat in hand befor me
what the matter i involuntarili ask
i beg your pardon sir i wa direct to come in is my master not

of steerforth himself but we becam in a moment the meekest of the meek
befor hi respect servingman mr micawb hum a tune to
show that he wa quit at eas subsid into hi chair with the handl
of a hastili conceal fork stick out of the bosom of hi coat as
if he had stab himself mr micawb put on her brown glove and
assum a genteel languor traddl ran hi greasi hand through
hi hair and stood it bolt upright and stare in confus on the
tablecloth as for me i wa a mere infant at the head of my own tabl
and hardli ventur to glanc at the respect phenomenon who had
come from heaven know where to put my establish to right
meanwhil he took the mutton off the gridiron and grave hand it
round we all took some but our appreci of it wa gone and we

he might have been here todai sir the mistak is mine no doubt sir
if you should see him first said i
if youll excus me sir i dont think i shall see him first
in case you do said i prai sai that i am sorri he wa not here
todai as an old schoolfellow of hi wa here
inde sir and he divid a bow between me and traddl with a
glanc at the latter
he wa move softli to the door when in a forlorn hope of sai
someth naturallywhich i never could to thi mani said
oh littim

not particularli so sir

ye sir i remain behind on purpos to see the boat complet
i know he rais hi ey to mine respectfulli
mr steerforth ha not seen it yet i suppos
i realli cant sai sir i thinkbut i realli cant sai sir i wish
you good night sir
he comprehend everybodi present in the respect bow with which he
follow these word and disappear my visitor seem to breath
more freeli when he wa gone but my own relief wa veri great for
besid the constraint aris from that extraordinari sens of
be at a disadvantag which i alwai had in thi man presenc my
conscienc had embarrass me with whisper that i had mistrust hi
master and i could not repress a vagu uneasi dread that he might
find it out how wa it have so littl in realiti to conceal that i
alwai did feel as if thi man were find me out
mr micawb rous me from thi reflect which wa blend with
a certain remors apprehens of see steerforth himself by
bestow mani encomium on the absent littim as a most respect
fellow and a thoroughli admir servant mr micawb i mai remark
had taken hi full share of the gener bow and had receiv it with
infinit condescens
but punch my dear copperfield said mr micawb tast it like
time and tide wait for no man ah it is at the present moment in high
flavour my love will you give me your opinion
mr micawb pronounc it excel
then i will drink said mr micawb if my friend copperfield
will permit me to take that social liberti to the dai when my friend
copperfield and myself were younger and fought our wai in the world
side by side i mai sai of myself and copperfield in word we have
sung togeth befor now that
we twa hae run about the brae
and pud the gowan fine
in a figur point of viewon sever occas i am not exactli
awar said mr micawb with the old roll in hi voic and the old
indescrib air of sai someth genteel what gowan mai be but
i have no doubt that copperfield and myself would frequent have taken
a pull at them if it had been feasibl
mr micawb at the then present moment took a pull at hi punch so
we all did traddl evid lost in wonder at what distant time
mr micawb and i could have been comrad in the battl of the world
ahem said mr micawb clear hi throat and warm with the
punch and with the fire my dear anoth glass
mr micawb said it must be veri littl but we couldnt allow that
so it wa a glass
as we ar quit confidenti here mr copperfield said mr
micawb sip her punch mr traddl be a part of our
domest i should much like to have your opinion on mr micawb
prospect for corn said mr micawb argument as i have
repeatedli said to mr micawb mai be gentlemanli but it is not
remun commiss to the extent of two and ninep in
a fortnight cannot howev limit our idea be consid
remun
we were all agre upon that
then said mr micawb who pride herself on take a clear view of
thing and keep mr micawb straight by her woman wisdom when he
might otherwis go a littl crook then i ask myself thi question
if corn is not to be reli upon what is ar coal to be reli upon
not at all we have turn our attent to that experi on the
suggest of my famili and we find it fallaci
mr micawb lean back in hi chair with hi hand in hi pocket
ei us asid and nod hi head as much as to sai that the case wa
veri clearli put
the articl of corn and coal said mr micawb still more
argument be equal out of the question mr copperfield
i natur look round the world and sai what is there in which a
person of mr micawb talent is like to succe and i exclud
the do anyth on commiss becaus commiss is not a certainti
what is best suit to a person of mr micawb peculiar tempera
is i am convinc a certainti
traddl and i both express by a feel murmur that thi great
discoveri wa no doubt true of mr micawb and that it did him much
credit
i will not conceal from you my dear mr copperfield said mr
micawb that i have long felt the brew busi to be particularli
adapt to mr micawb look at barclai and perkin look at truman
hanburi and buxton it is on that extens foot that mr micawb
i know from my own knowledg of him is calcul to shine and the
profit i am told ar enorm but if mr micawb cannot get into
those firmswhich declin to answer hi letter when he offer hi
servic even in an inferior capacitywhat is the us of dwell upon
that idea none i mai have a convict that mr micawb manner
hem realli my dear interpos mr micawb
my love be silent said mr micawb lai her brown glove on hi
hand i mai have a convict mr copperfield that mr micawb
manner peculiarli qualifi him for the bank busi i mai argu
within myself that if i had a deposit at a bankinghous the manner
of mr micawb as repres that bankinghous would inspir
confid and must extend the connexion but if the variou
bankinghous refus to avail themselv of mr micawb abil
or receiv the offer of them with contum what is the us of dwell
upon that idea none as to origin a bankingbusi i mai know
that there ar member of my famili who if thei chose to place their
monei in mr micawb hand might found an establish of that
descript but if thei do not choos to place their monei in mr
micawb handswhich thei dontwhat is the us of that again i
contend that we ar no farther advanc than we were befor
i shook my head and said not a bit traddl also shook hi head
and said not a bit
what do i deduc from thi mr micawb went on to sai still with
the same air of put a case lucidli what is the conclus my
dear mr copperfield to which i am irresist brought am i wrong in
sai it is clear that we must live
i answer not at all and traddl answer not at all and i found
myself afterward sage ad alon that a person must either live
or die
just so return mr micawb it is precis that and the fact
is my dear mr copperfield that we can not live without someth
wide differ from exist circumst shortli turn up now
i am convinc myself and thi i have point out to mr micawb
sever time of late that thing cannot be expect to turn up of
themselv we must in a measur assist to turn them up i mai be
wrong but i have form that opinion
both traddl and i applaud it highli
veri well said mr micawb then what do i recommend here is mr
micawb with a varieti of qualificationswith great talent
realli my love said mr micawb
prai my dear allow me to conclud here is mr micawb with a
varieti of qualif with great talenti should sai with geniu
but that mai be the partial of a wife
traddl and i both murmur no
and here is mr micawb without ani suitabl posit or employ
where doe that respons rest clearli on societi then i would
make a fact so disgrac known and boldli challeng societi to set it
right it appear to me my dear mr copperfield said mr micawb
forcibl that what mr micawb ha to do is to throw down the
gauntlet to societi and sai in effect show me who will take that up
let the parti immedi step forward
i ventur to ask mr micawb how thi wa to be done
by advertis said mr micawberin all the paper it appear to
me that what mr micawb ha to do in justic to himself in justic
to hi famili and i will even go so far as to sai in justic to
societi by which he ha been hitherto overlook is to advertis in
all the paper to describ himself plainli as soandso with such and
such qualif and to put it thu now emploi me on remun
term and address postpaid to w m post offic camden town
thi idea of mr micawb my dear copperfield said mr micawb
make hi shirtcollar meet in front of hi chin and glanc at me
sidewai is in fact the leap to which i allud when i last had the
pleasur of see you
advertis is rather expens i remark dubious
exactli so said mr micawb preserv the same logic air
quit true my dear mr copperfield i have made the ident
observ to mr micawb it is for that reason especi that i
think mr micawb ought as i have alreadi said in justic to himself
in justic to hi famili and in justic to societi to rais a certain
sum of moneyon a bill
mr micawb lean back in hi chair trifl with hi eyeglass
and cast hi ey up at the ceil but i thought him observ of
traddl too who wa look at the fire
if no member of my famili said mr micawb is possess of
suffici natur feel to negoti that billi believ there is a
better businessterm to express what i mean
mr micawb with hi ey still cast up at the ceil suggest
discount
to discount that bill said mr micawb then my opinion is that
mr micawb should go into the citi should take that bill into the
monei market and should dispos of it for what he can get if the
individu in the monei market oblig mr micawb to sustain a great
sacrific that is between themselv and their conscienc i view
it steadili as an invest i recommend mr micawb my dear mr
copperfield to do the same to regard it as an invest which is sure
of return and to make up hi mind to ani sacrific
i felt but i am sure i dont know why that thi wa selfdeni
and devot in mr micawb and i utter a murmur to that effect
traddl who took hi tone from me did likewis still look at the
fire
i will not said mr micawb finish her punch and gather her
scarf about her shoulder preparatori to her withdraw to my bedroom
i will not protract these remark on the subject of mr micawb
pecuniari affair at your firesid my dear mr copperfield and in the
presenc of mr traddl who though not so old a friend is quit on
of ourselv i could not refrain from make you acquaint with the
cours i advis mr micawb to take i feel that the time is arriv
when mr micawb should exert himself andi will addassert himself
and it appear to me that these ar the mean i am awar that i am
mere a femal and that a masculin judgement is usual consid
more compet to the discuss of such question still i must not
forget that when i live at home with my papa and mama my papa wa in
the habit of sai emma form is fragil but her grasp of a subject
is inferior to none that my papa wa too partial i well know but
that he wa an observ of charact in some degre my duti and my
reason equal forbid me to doubt
with these word and resist our entreati that she would grace
the remain circul of the punch with her presenc mr micawb
retir to my bedroom and realli i felt that she wa a nobl womanth
sort of woman who might have been a roman matron and done all manner of
heroic thing in time of public troubl
in the fervour of thi impress i congratul mr micawb on the
treasur he possess so did traddl mr micawb extend hi
hand to each of us in success and then cover hi face with hi
pockethandkerchief which i think had more snuff upon it than he
wa awar of he then return to the punch in the highest state of
exhilar
he wa full of eloqu he gave us to understand that in our children
we live again and that under the pressur of pecuniari difficulti
ani access to their number wa doubli welcom he said that mr
micawb had latterli had her doubt on thi point but that he had
dispel them and reassur her as to her famili thei were total
unworthi of her and their sentiment were utterli indiffer to him
and thei mighti quot hi own expressiongo to the devil
mr micawb then deliv a warm eulogi on traddl he said
traddless wa a charact to the steadi virtu of which he mr
micawb could lai no claim but which he thank heaven he could
admir he feelingli allud to the young ladi unknown whom traddl
had honour with hi affect and who had reciproc that affect
by honour and bless traddl with her affect mr micawb
pledg her so did i traddl thank us both by sai with a
simplic and honesti i had sens enough to be quit charm with
i am veri much oblig to you inde and i do assur you she the
dearest girl
mr micawb took an earli opportun after that of hint with the
utmost delicaci and ceremoni at the state of my affect noth
but the seriou assur of hi friend copperfield to the contrari
he observ could depriv him of the impress that hi friend
copperfield love and wa belov after feel veri hot and
uncomfort for some time and after a good deal of blush
stammer and deni i said have my glass in my hand well i
would give them d which so excit and gratifi mr micawb
that he ran with a glass of punch into my bedroom in order that mr
micawb might drink d who drank it with enthusiasm cry from
within in a shrill voic hear hear my dear mr copperfield i am
delight hear and tap at the wall by wai of applaus
our convers afterward took a more worldli turn mr micawb
tell us that he found camden town inconveni and that the first
thing he contempl do when the advertis should have been the
caus of someth satisfactori turn up wa to move he mention
a terrac at the western end of oxford street front hyde park on
which he had alwai had hi ey but which he did not expect to attain
immedi as it would requir a larg establish there would
probabl be an interv he explain in which he should content
himself with the upper part of a hous over some respect place of
businesssai in piccadillywhich would be a cheer situat for
mr micawb and where by throw out a bowwindow or carri up
the roof anoth stori or make some littl alter of that sort
thei might live comfort and reput for a few year whatev
wa reserv for him he expressli said or wherev hi abod might be
we might reli on thisther would alwai be a room for traddl and a
knife and fork for me we acknowledg hi kind and he beg us
to forgiv hi have launch into these practic and businesslik
detail and to excus it as natur in on who wa make entir new
arrang in life
mr micawb tap at the wall again to know if tea were readi
broke up thi particular phase of our friendli convers she made
tea for us in a most agreeabl manner and whenev i went near her in
hand about the teacup and breadandbutt ask me in a whisper
whether d wa fair or dark or whether she wa short or tall or
someth of that kind which i think i like after tea we discuss a
varieti of topic befor the fire and mr micawb wa good enough
to sing us in a small thin flat voic which i rememb to have
consid when i first knew her the veri tableb of acoust the
favourit ballad of the dash white sergeant and littl tafflin
for both of these song mr micawb had been famou when she live at
home with her papa and mama mr micawb told us that when he heard
her sing the first on on the first occas of hi see her beneath
the parent roof she had attract hi attent in an extraordinari
degre but that when it came to littl tafflin he had resolv to win
that woman or perish in the attempt
it wa between ten and eleven oclock when mr micawb rose to replac
her cap in the whiteybrown paper parcel and to put on her bonnet mr
micawb took the opportun of traddl put on hi greatcoat to
slip a letter into my hand with a whisper request that i would read
it at my leisur i also took the opportun of my hold a candl
over the banist to light them down when mr micawb wa go
first lead mr micawb and traddl wa follow with the cap
to detain traddl for a moment on the top of the stair
traddl said i mr micawb dont mean ani harm poor fellow but
if i were you i wouldnt lend him anyth
my dear copperfield return traddl smile i havent got
anyth to lend
you have got a name you know said i
oh you call that someth to lend return traddl with a
thought look
certainli
oh said traddl ye to be sure i am veri much oblig to you
copperfield buti am afraid i have lent him that alreadi
for the bill that is to be a certain invest i inquir
no said traddl not for that on thi is the first i have heard
of that on i have been think that he will most like propos that
on on the wai home mine anoth
i hope there will be noth wrong about it said i i hope not
said traddl i should think not though becaus he told me onli the
other dai that it wa provid for that wa mr micawb express
provid for
mr micawb look up at thi junctur to where we were stand i
had onli time to repeat my caution traddl thank me and descend
but i wa much afraid when i observ the goodnatur manner in which
he went down with the cap in hi hand and gave mr micawb hi arm
that he would be carri into the monei market neck and heel
i return to my firesid and wa muse half grave and half
laugh on the charact of mr micawb and the old relat between
us when i heard a quick step ascend the stair at first i thought
it wa traddl come back for someth mr micawb had left behind
but as the step approach i knew it and felt my heart beat high and
the blood rush to my face for it wa steerforth
i wa never unmind of agn and she never left that sanctuari in my
thoughtsif i mai call it sowher i had place her from the first
but when he enter and stood befor me with hi hand out the dark
that had fallen on him chang to light and i felt confound and
asham of have doubt on i love so heartili i love her none the
less i thought of her as the same benign gentl angel in my life i
reproach myself not her with have done him an injuri and i would
have made him ani aton if i had known what to make and how to make
it

of the fire with the poker is he as soft as ever and where the deuc

i extol traddl in repli as highli as i could for i felt that
steerforth rather slight him steerforth dismiss the subject with
a light nod and a smile and the remark that he would be glad to see
the old fellow too for he had alwai been an odd fish inquir if i
could give him anyth to eat dure most of thi short dialogu when

i wa undress in my own room when mr micawb letter tumbl on
the floor thu remind of it i broke the seal and read as follow it
wa date an hour and a half befor dinner i am not sure whether i
have mention that when mr micawb wa at ani particularli desper
crisi he us a sort of legal phraseolog which he seem to think
equival to wind up hi affair
sirfor i dare not sai my dear copperfield
it is expedi that i should inform you that the undersign is
crush some flicker effort to spare you the prematur knowledg of
hi calamit posit you mai observ in him thi dai but hope ha
sunk beneath the horizon and the undersign is crush
the present commun is pen within the person rang i cannot
call it the societi of an individu in a state close border
on intox emploi by a broker that individu is in legal
possess of the premis under a distress for rent hi inventori
includ not onli the chattel and effect of everi descript
belong to the undersign as yearli tenant of thi habit but
also those appertain to mr thoma traddl lodger a member of the
honour societi of the inner templ
if ani drop of gloom were want in the overflow cup which is now
commend in the languag of an immort writer to the lip of the
undersign it would be found in the fact that a friendli accept
grant to the undersign by the beforement mr thoma traddl
for the sum of 23l 4s 9 12d is over due and is not provid for also
in the fact that the live respons cling to the undersign
will in the cours of natur be increas by the sum of on more

from the present date
after premis thu much it would be a work of supererog to add
that dust and ash ar for ever scatter
on
the

of
wilkin micawb
poor traddl i knew enough of mr micawb by thi time to forese
that he might be expect to recov the blow but my night rest wa
sore distress by thought of traddl and of the curat daughter
who wa on of ten down in devonshir and who wa such a dear girl
and who would wait for traddl omin prais until she wa sixti
or ani ag that could be mention
chapter 29 i visit steerforth at hi home again
i mention to mr spenlow in the morn that i want leav of
absenc for a short time and as i wa not in the receipt of ani salari
and consequ wa not obnoxi to the implac jorkin there wa
no difficulti about it i took that opportun with my voic stick
in my throat and my sight fail as i utter the word to express
my hope that miss spenlow wa quit well to which mr spenlow repli
with no more emot than if he had been speak of an ordinari human
be that he wa much oblig to me and she wa veri well
we articl clerk as germ of the patrician order of proctor were
treat with so much consider that i wa almost my own master at
all time as i did not care howev to get to highgat befor on
or two oclock in the dai and as we had anoth littl excommun
case in court that morn which wa call the offic of the judg
promot by tipkin against bullock for hi soul correct i pass
an hour or two in attend on it with mr spenlow veri agreeabl
it aros out of a scuffl between two churchwarden on of whom wa
alleg to have push the other against a pump the handl of which
pump project into a schoolhous which schoolhous wa under a
gabl of the churchroof made the push an ecclesiast offenc
it wa an amus case and sent me up to highgat on the box of the
stagecoach think about the common and what mr spenlow had said
about touch the common and bring down the countri
mr steerforth wa pleas to see me and so wa rosa dartl i wa
agreeabl surpris to find that littim wa not there and that we
were attend by a modest littl parlourmaid with blue ribbon in her
cap whose ey it wa much more pleasant and much less disconcert
to catch by accid than the ey of that respect man but what i
particularli observ befor i had been halfanhour in the hous wa
the close and attent watch miss dartl kept upon me and the lurk
manner in which she seem to compar my face with steerforth and
steerforth with mine and to lie in wait for someth to come out
between the two so sure as i look toward her did i see that eager
visag with it gaunt black ey and search brow intent on mine or
pass suddenli from mine to steerforth or comprehend both of us
at onc in thi lynxlik scrutini she wa so far from falter when
she saw i observ it that at such a time she onli fix her pierc
look upon me with a more intent express still blameless as i wa
and knew that i wa in refer to ani wrong she could possibl
suspect me of i shrunk befor her strang ey quit unabl to endur
their hungri lustr
all dai she seem to pervad the whole hous if i talk to
steerforth in hi room i heard her dress rustl in the littl galleri
outsid when he and i engag in some of our old exercis on the lawn
behind the hous i saw her face pass from window to window like a
wander light until it fix itself in on and watch us when we

lip and deep into the nether lip and slant down the face there wa
someth posit aw to me in thi and in the bright of her
ey as she said look fixedli at me

mr steerforth wa particularli happi in her son societi and
steerforth wa on thi occas particularli attent and respect
to her it wa veri interest to me to see them togeth not onli on
account of their mutual affect but becaus of the strong person
resembl between them and the manner in which what wa haughti or
impetu in him wa soften by ag and sex in her to a graciou
digniti i thought more than onc that it wa well no seriou caus of
divis had ever come between them or two such naturesi ought rather
to express it two such shade of the same naturemight have been
harder to reconcil than the two extremest opposit in creation the
idea did not origin in my own discern i am bound to confess but
in a speech of rosa dartl

worldin a better school

of anyth of cours you know i am sure of that
mr steerforth appear to me to regret have been a littl nettl
for she present said in a kind tone

cold oh it wa onli whether peopl who ar like each other in
their moral constitutioni that the phrase

thank youwheth peopl who ar like each other in their moral
constitut ar in greater danger than peopl not so circumstanc

have been so foolish as to put the case for it is so veri good to know
that your duti to each other would prevent it thank you veri much
on other littl circumst connect with miss dartl i must
not omit for i had reason to rememb it thereaft when all the
irremedi past wa render plain dure the whole of thi dai but
especi from thi period of it steerforth exert himself with hi
utmost skill and that wa with hi utmost eas to charm thi singular
creatur into a pleasant and pleas companion that he should succe
wa no matter of surpris to me that she should struggl against the
fascin influenc of hi delight artdelight natur i thought
it thendid not surpris me either for i knew that she wa sometim
jaundic and pervers i saw her featur and her manner slowli chang
i saw her look at him with grow admir i saw her try more and
more faintli but alwai angrili as if she condemn a weak in
herself to resist the captiv power that he possess and final
i saw her sharp glanc soften and her smile becom quit gentl and i
ceas to be afraid of her as i had realli been all dai and we all sat
about the fire talk and laugh togeth with as littl reserv as
if we had been children
whether it wa becaus we had sat there so long or becaus steerforth
wa resolv not to lose the advantag he had gain i do not know but
we did not remain in the diningroom more than five minut after her
departur she is plai her harp said steerforth softli at the
drawingroom door and nobodi but my mother ha heard her do that i
believ these three year he said it with a curiou smile which wa
gone directli and we went into the room and found her alon

himself near the harp she stood besid it for some littl while in a
curiou wai go through the motion of plai it with her right hand
but not sound it at length she sat down and drew it to her with on
sudden action and plai and sang
i dont know what it wa in her touch or voic that made that song the
most unearthli i have ever heard in my life or can imagin there wa
someth fear in the realiti of it it wa as if it had never been
written or set to music but sprung out of passion within her which
found imperfect utter in the low sound of her voic and crouch
again when all wa still i wa dumb when she lean besid the harp
again plai it but not sound it with her right hand
a minut more and thi had rous me from my trancesteerforth had
left hi seat and gone to her and had put hi arm laughingli about
her and had said come rosa for the futur we will love each other
veri much and she had struck him and had thrown him off with the furi
of a wild cat and had burst out of the room

surpris to see me as i had expect i remark thi in peggotti
too when she came down and i have seen it sinc and i think in the
expect of that dread surpris all other chang and surpris

i shook hand with mr peggotti and pass into the kitchen while he
softli close the door littl emili wa sit by the fire with her
hand befor her face ham wa stand near her
we spoke in whisper listen between while for ani sound in the
room abov i had not thought of it on the occas of my last visit
but how strang it wa to me now to miss mr barki out of the
kitchen

to shrink from mine and then she glide from the chair and creep
to the other side of her uncl bow herself silent and trembl
still upon hi breast
it such a love art said mr peggotti smooth her rich hair
with hi great hard hand that it cant abear the sorrer of thi
it natral in young folk masr davi when theyr new to these here
trial and timid like my littl birdit natral
she clung the closer to him but neither lift up her face nor spoke a

the sound of her voic had not reach me but he bent hi head as if he

fur to take you home now a person wouldnt think it fur to see thi

look round at both of us with infinit pride but the sea aint

emli wish of it and as she hurri and frighten like besid
ill leav her till morn let me stai too

ham yield to thi persuas and took hi hat to go even when he

had given him the soul of a gentlemansh seem to cling closer to
her uncl even to the avoid of her chosen husband i shut the
door after him that it might caus no disturb of the quiet that
prevail and when i turn back i found mr peggotti still talk to
her
now im a go upstair to tell your aunt as masr davi here and
thatll cheer her up a bit he said sit ye down by the fire the
while my dear and warm those mortal cold hand you doent need to be
so fearsom and take on so much what youll go along with mewel

and forc to lai down in a dyke masr davi said mr peggotti with
no less pride than befor it my belief shed go along with him now
but therel be someon els soonsomeon els soon emli
afterward when i went upstair as i pass the door of my littl
chamber which wa dark i had an indistinct impress of her be
within it cast down upon the floor but whether it wa realli she or
whether it wa a confus of the shadow in the room i dont know now
i had leisur to think befor the kitchen fire of pretti littl
emili dread of deathwhich ad to what mr omer had told me i
took to be the caus of her be so unlik herselfand i had leisur
befor peggotti came down even to think more lenient of the weak
of it as i sat count the tick of the clock and deepen my
sens of the solemn hush around me peggotti took me in her arm and
bless and thank me over and over again for be such a comfort to
her that wa what she said in her distress she then entreat me to
come upstair sob that mr barki had alwai like me and admir
me that he had often talk of me befor he fell into a stupor and
that she believ in case of hi come to himself again he would
brighten up at sight of me if he could brighten up at ani earthli
thing
the probabl of hi ever do so appear to me when i saw him to
be veri small he wa ly with hi head and shoulder out of bed in
an uncomfort attitud half rest on the box which had cost him so
much pain and troubl i learn that when he wa past creep out of
bed to open it and past assur himself of it safeti by mean of the
divin rod i had seen him us he had requir to have it place on
the chair at the bedsid where he had ever sinc embrac it night
and dai hi arm lai on it now time and the world were slip from
beneath him but the box wa there and the last word he had utter
were in an explanatori tone old cloth
barki my dear said peggotti almost cheerfulli bend over him
while her brother and i stood at the bed foot here my dear boymi
dear boi master davi who brought us togeth barki that you sent
messag by you know wont you speak to master davi
he wa as mute and senseless as the box from which hi form deriv the
onli express it had
he a go out with the tide said mr peggotti to me behind hi
hand
my ey were dim and so were mr peggotti but i repeat in a
whisper with the tide
peopl cant die along the coast said mr peggotti except when
the tide pretti nigh out thei cant be born unless it pretti nigh
innot properli born till flood he a go out with the tide it
ebb at halfart three slack water half an hour if he live till it
turn hell hold hi own till past the flood and go out with the next
tide
we remain there watch him a long timehour what mysteri
influenc my presenc had upon him in that state of hi sens i shall
not pretend to sai but when he at last began to wander feebli it is
certain he wa mutter about drive me to school
he come to himself said peggotti
mr peggotti touch me and whisper with much aw and rever
thei ar both ago out fast
barki my dear said peggotti
c p barki he cri faintli no better woman anywher
look here master davi said peggotti for he now open hi ey
i wa on the point of ask him if he knew me when he tri to stretch
out hi arm and said to me distinctli with a pleasant smile
barki is willin
and it be low water he went out with the tide
chapter 31 a greater loss
it wa not difficult for me on peggotti solicit to resolv to
stai where i wa until after the remain of the poor carrier should
have made their last journei to blunderston she had long ago bought
out of her own save a littl piec of ground in our old churchyard
near the grave of her sweet girl as she alwai call my mother and
there thei were to rest
in keep peggotti compani and do all i could for her littl
enough at the utmost i wa as grate i rejoic to think as even
now i could wish myself to have been but i am afraid i had a suprem
satisfact of a person and profession natur in take charg of
mr barkiss will and expound it content
i mai claim the merit of have origin the suggest that the will
should be look for in the box after some search it wa found in the
box at the bottom of a hors nosebag wherein besid hai there
wa discov an old gold watch with chain and seal which mr barki
had worn on hi weddingdai and which had never been seen befor or
sinc a silver tobaccostopp in the form of a leg an imit
lemon full of minut cup and saucer which i have some idea mr
barki must have purchas to present to me when i wa a child and
afterward found himself unabl to part with eightyseven guinea and
a half in guinea and halfguinea two hundr and ten pound in
perfectli clean bank note certain receipt for bank of england
stock an old horsesho a bad shill a piec of camphor and an
oystershel from the circumst of the latter articl have
been much polish and displai prismat colour on the insid
i conclud that mr barki had some gener idea about pearl which
never resolv themselv into anyth definit
for year and year mr barki had carri thi box on all hi
journei everi dai that it might the better escap notic he had
invent a fiction that it belong to mr blackboi and wa to be
left with barki till call for a fabl he had elabor written on
the lid in charact now scarc legibl
he had hoard all these year i found to good purpos hi properti
in monei amount to nearli three thousand pound of thi he bequeath
the interest of on thousand to mr peggotti for hi life on hi
deceas the princip to be equal divid between peggotti littl
emili and me or the survivor or survivor of us share and share
alik all the rest he di possess of he bequeath to peggotti
whom he left residuari legate and sole executrix of that hi last will
and testament
i felt myself quit a proctor when i read thi document aloud with all
possibl ceremoni and set forth it provis ani number of time
to those whom thei concern i began to think there wa more in the
common than i had suppos i examin the will with the deepest
attent pronounc it perfectli formal in all respect made a
pencilmark or so in the margin and thought it rather extraordinari
that i knew so much
in thi abstrus pursuit in make an account for peggotti of all the

chapter 32 the begin of a long journei
what is natur in me is natur in mani other men i infer and so
i am not afraid to write that i never had love steerforth better than
when the ti that bound me to him were broken in the keen distress
of the discoveri of hi unworthi i thought more of all that wa
brilliant in him i soften more toward all that wa good in him i
did more justic to the qualiti that might have made him a man of a
nobl natur and a great name than ever i had done in the height of
my devot to him deepli as i felt my own unconsci part in hi
pollut of an honest home i believ that if i had been brought face
to face with him i could not have utter on reproach i should have
love him so well stillthough he fascin me no longeri should
have held in so much tender the memori of my affect for him that
i think i should have been as weak as a spiritwound child in all
but the entertain of a thought that we could ever be reunit
that thought i never had i felt as he had felt that all wa at an end
between us what hi remembr of me were i have never knownthei
were light enough perhap and easili dismissedbut mine of him were
as the remembr of a cherish friend who wa dead
ye steerforth long remov from the scene of thi poor histori my
sorrow mai bear involuntari wit against you at the judgement throne
but my angri thought or my reproach never will i know
the new of what had happen soon spread through the town insomuch
that as i pass along the street next morn i overheard the peopl
speak of it at their door mani were hard upon her some few were
hard upon him but toward her second father and her lover there wa
but on sentiment among all kind of peopl a respect for them in
their distress prevail which wa full of gentl and delicaci the
seafar men kept apart when those two were seen earli walk with
slow step on the beach and stood in knot talk compassion
among themselv
it wa on the beach close down by the sea that i found them it would
have been easi to perceiv that thei had not slept all last night even
if peggotti had fail to tell me of their still sit just as i
left them when it wa broad dai thei look worn and i thought mr
peggotti head wa bow in on night more than in all the year i had
known him but thei were both as grave and steadi as the sea itself
then ly beneath a dark sky wavelessyet with a heavi roll upon it
as if it breath in it restand touch on the horizon with a strip
of silveri light from the unseen sun
we have had a mort of talk sir said mr peggotti to me when we had
all three walk a littl while in silenc of what we ought and doent
ought to do but we see our cours now
i happen to glanc at ham then look out to sea upon the distant
light and a fright thought came into my mindnot that hi face
wa angri for it wa not i recal noth but an express of stern
determin in itthat if ever he encount steerforth he would
kill him

her that my dooti evermor

peep in mayb like a ghost out of the wind and rain through the old
winder at the old seat by the fire then mayb masr davi seein
none but missi gummidg there she might take heart to creep in
trembl and might come to be laid down in her old bed and rest her
weari head where it wa onc so gai

everi night said mr peggotti as reglar as the night come the
candl must be stood in it old pane of glass that if ever she should
see it it mai seem to sai come back my child come back if ever

express on hi face and hi ey still direct to the distant
light i touch hi arm

to rous a sleeper befor he heed me when i at last inquir on what

what a chang in mr gummidg in a littl time she wa anoth woman
she wa so devot she had such a quick percept of what it would
be well to sai and what it would be well to leav unsaid she wa so
forget of herself and so regard of the sorrow about her that i
held her in a sort of vener the work she did that dai there
were mani thing to be brought up from the beach and store in the
outhousea oar net sail cordag spar lobsterpot bag of
ballast and the like and though there wa abund of assist
render there be not a pair of work hand on all that shore but
would have labour hard for mr peggotti and been well paid in be
ask to do it yet she persist all dai long in toil under
weight that she wa quit unequ to and fag to and fro on all
sort of unnecessari errand as to deplor her misfortun she
appear to have entir lost the recollect of ever have had ani
she preserv an equabl cheer in the midst of her sympathi
which wa not the least astonish part of the chang that had come
over her querul wa out of the question i did not even observ
her voic to falter or a tear to escap from her ey the whole dai
through until twilight when she and i and mr peggotti be alon
togeth and he have fallen asleep in perfect exhaust she broke
into a halfsuppress fit of sob and cry and take me to the
door said ever bless you masr davi be a friend to him poor dear
then she immedi ran out of the hous to wash her face in order
that she might sit quietli besid him and be found at work there when
he should awak in short i left her when i went awai at night the
prop and staff of mr peggotti afflict and i could not medit
enough upon the lesson that i read in mr gummidg and the new
experi she unfold to me
it wa between nine and ten oclock when stroll in a melancholi
manner through the town i stop at mr omer door mr omer had

drive out with the tide toward the distanc at which ham had look
so singularli in the morn when i wa recal from my wander by
a knock at the door there wa a knocker upon the door but it wa not
that which made the sound the tap wa from a hand and low down upon
the door as if it were given by a child
it made me start as much as if it had been the knock of a footman to a
person of distinct i open the door and at first look down
to my amaz on noth but a great umbrella that appear to be
walk about of itself but present i discov underneath it miss
mowcher

recept if on her remov the umbrella which her utmost effort
were unabl to shut up she had shown me the volatil express of
face which had made so great an impress on me at our first and last
meet but her face as she turn it up to mine wa so earnest
and when i reliev her of the umbrella which would have been an
inconveni on for the irish giant she wrung her littl hand in
such an afflict manner that i rather inclin toward her
miss mowcher said i after glanc up and down the empti street
without distinctli know what i expect to see besid how do you

arm to shut the umbrella for her and pass me hurriedli went into

to trampl on hi undeserv afflict
i would trampl on them all she answer i would have hi hous
pull down i would have her brand on the face dress in rag
and cast out in the street to starv if i had the power to sit in
judgement on her i would see it done see it done i would do it i
detest her if i ever could reproach her with her infam condit i
would go anywher to do so if i could hunt her to her grave i would
if there wa ani word of comfort that would be a solac to her in her
dy hour and onli i possess it i wouldnt part with it for life
itself
the mere vehem of her word can convei i am sensibl but a weak
impress of the passion by which she wa possess and which made
itself articul in her whole figur though her voic instead of
be rais wa lower than usual no descript i could give of her
would do justic to my recollect of her or to her entir deliver
of herself to her anger i have seen passion in mani form but i have
never seen it in such a form as that
when i join mr peggotti he wa walk slowli and thoughtfulli down
the hill he told me as soon as i came up with him that have now
discharg hi mind of what he had purpos do in london he meant
to set out on hi travel that night i ask him where he meant to

we went back to the littl lodg over the chandler shop and there
i found an opportun of repeat to peggotti what he had said to
me she inform me in return that he had said the same to her that
morn she knew no more than i did where he wa go but she
thought he had some project shape out in hi mind
i did not like to leav him under such circumst and we all three
dine togeth off a beefsteak piewhich wa on of the mani good
thing for which peggotti wa famousand which wa curious flavour
on thi occas i recollect well by a miscellan tast of tea
coffe butter bacon chees new loav firewood candl and walnut

hour or so near the window without talk much and then mr peggotti
got up and brought hi oilskin bag and hi stout stick and laid them

down the stair and awai we follow to the door it wa a warm dusti
even just the time when in the great main thoroughfar out of which
that bywai turn there wa a temporari lull in the etern tread of
feet upon the pavement and a strong red sunshin he turn alon at
the corner of our shadi street into a glow of light in which we lost
him
rare did that hour of the even come rare did i wake at night

or hear the wind but i thought of hi solitari figur toil on poor
pilgrim and recal the word

chapter 33 bliss
all thi time i had gone on love dora harder than ever her idea wa
my refug in disappoint and distress and made some amend to me
even for the loss of my friend the more i piti myself or piti
other the more i sought for consol in the imag of dora the
greater the accumul of deceit and troubl in the world the
brighter and the purer shone the star of dora high abov the world i
dont think i had ani definit idea where dora came from or in what
degre she wa relat to a higher order of be but i am quit sure
i should have scout the notion of her be simpli human like ani
other young ladi with indign and contempt
if i mai so express it i wa steep in dora i wa not mere over
head and ear in love with her but i wa satur through and through
enough love might have been wrung out of me metaphor speak
to drown anybodi in and yet there would have remain enough within me
and all over me to pervad my entir exist
the first thing i did on my own account when i came back wa to take
a nightwalk to norwood and like the subject of a vener riddl of
my childhood to go round and round the hous without ever
touch the hous think about dora i believ the theme of thi
incomprehens conundrum wa the moon no matter what it wa i the
moonstruck slave of dora perambul round and round the hous and
garden for two hour look through crevic in the pale get
my chin by dint of violent exert abov the rusti nail on the top
blow kiss at the light in the window and romant call
on the night at interv to shield my dorai dont exactli know what
from i suppos from fire perhap from mice to which she had a great
object
my love wa so much in my mind and it wa so natur to me to confid in
peggotti when i found her again by my side of an even with the old
set of industri implement busili make the tour of my wardrob
that i impart to her in a suffici roundabout wai my great
secret peggotti wa strongli interest but i could not get her into
my view of the case at all she wa audaci prejud in my favour
and quit unabl to understand why i should have ani misgiv or be
lowspirit about it the young ladi might think herself well off
she observ to have such a beau and as to her pa she said what
did the gentleman expect for graciou sake
i observ howev that mr spenlow proctori gown and stiff cravat
took peggotti down a littl and inspir her with a greater rever
for the man who wa gradual becom more and more ether in my
ey everi dai and about whom a reflect radianc seem to me to beam
when he sat erect in court among hi paper like a littl lighthous in
a sea of stationeri and by the by it us to be uncommonli strang
to me to consid i rememb as i sat in court too how those dim old
judg and doctor wouldnt have care for dora if thei had known
her how thei wouldnt have gone out of their sens with raptur if
marriag with dora had been propos to them how dora might have sung
and plai upon that glorifi guitar until she led me to the verg of
mad yet not have tempt on of those slowgoer an inch out of hi
road
i despis them to a man frozenout old garden in the flowerb
of the heart i took a person offenc against them all the bench
wa noth to me but an insens blunder the bar had no more
tender or poetri in it than the bar of a publichous
take the manag of peggotti affair into my own hand with
no littl pride i prove the will and came to a settlement with the
legaci dutyoffic and took her to the bank and soon got everyth
into an orderli train we vari the legal charact of these
proceed by go to see some perspir waxwork in fleet street
melt i should hope these twenti year and by visit miss
linwood exhibit which i rememb as a mausoleum of needlework
favour to selfexamin and repent and by inspect the
tower of london and go to the top of st paul all these wonder
afford peggotti as much pleasur as she wa abl to enjoi under
exist circumst except i think st paul which from her
long attach to her workbox becam a rival of the pictur on the
lid and wa in some particular vanquish she consid by that
work of art
peggotti busi which wa what we us to call commonform
busi in the common and veri light and lucr the commonform
busi wa be settl i took her down to the offic on morn
to pai her bill mr spenlow had step out old tiffei said to get a
gentleman sworn for a marriag licenc but as i knew he would be
back directli our place ly close to the surrog and to the
vicargener offic too i told peggotti to wait
we were a littl like undertak in the common as regard probat
transact gener make it a rule to look more or less cut up
when we had to deal with client in mourn in a similar feel
of delicaci we were alwai blith and lightheart with the licenc
client therefor i hint to peggotti that she would find mr spenlow
much recov from the shock of mr barkiss deceas and inde he
came in like a bridegroom
but neither peggotti nor i had ey for him when we saw in compani
with him mr murdston he wa veri littl chang hi hair look as
thick and wa certainli as black as ever and hi glanc wa as littl
to be trust as of old
ah copperfield said mr spenlow you know thi gentleman i
believ
i made my gentleman a distant bow and peggotti bare recogn him
he wa at first somewhat disconcert to meet us two togeth but
quickli decid what to do and came up to me
i hope he said that you ar do well
it can hardli be interest to you said i ye if you wish to
know
we look at each other and he address himself to peggotti
and you said he i am sorri to observ that you have lost your
husband
it not the first loss i have had in my life mr murdston repli
peggotti trembl from head to foot i am glad to hope that there is
nobodi to blame for thi onenobodi to answer for it
ha said he that a comfort reflect you have done your
duti
i have not worn anybodi life awai said peggotti i am thank to
think no mr murdston i have not worrit and frighten ani sweet
creetur to an earli grave
he ei her gloomilyremorsefulli i thoughtfor an instant and said
turn hi head toward me but look at my feet instead of my face
we ar not like to encount soon againa sourc of satisfact to
us both no doubt for such meet as thi can never be agreeabl i
do not expect that you who alwai rebel against my just author
exert for your benefit and reform should ow me ani goodwil
now there is an antipathi between us
an old on i believ said i interrupt him
he smile and shot as evil a glanc at me as could come from hi dark
ey
it rankl in your babi breast he said it embitt the life of
your poor mother you ar right i hope you mai do better yet i hope
you mai correct yourself
here he end the dialogu which had been carri on in a low voic
in a corner of the outer offic by pass into mr spenlow room and
sai aloud in hi smoothest manner
gentlemen of mr spenlow profess ar accustom to famili
differ and know how complic and difficult thei alwai ar
with that he paid the monei for hi licenc and receiv it neatli
fold from mr spenlow togeth with a shake of the hand and a polit
wish for hi happi and the ladi went out of the offic
i might have had more difficulti in constrain myself to be silent
under hi word if i had had less difficulti in impress upon
peggotti who wa onli angri on my account good creatur that we were
not in a place for recrimin and that i besought her to hold her
peac she wa so unusu rous that i wa glad to compound for
an affection hug elicit by thi reviv in her mind of our old
injuri and to make the best i could of it befor mr spenlow and the
clerk
mr spenlow did not appear to know what the connexion between mr
murdston and myself wa which i wa glad of for i could not bear to
acknowledg him even in my own breast rememb what i did of the
histori of my poor mother mr spenlow seem to think if he thought
anyth about the matter that my aunt wa the leader of the state
parti in our famili and that there wa a rebel parti command by
somebodi elseso i gather at least from what he said while we were
wait for mr tiffei to make out peggotti bill of cost
miss trotwood he remark is veri firm no doubt and not like
to give wai to opposit i have an admir for her charact and
i mai congratul you copperfield on be on the right side
differ between relat ar much to be deploredbut thei ar
extrem generaland the great thing is to be on the right side
mean i take it on the side of the monei interest
rather a good marriag thi i believ said mr spenlow
i explain that i knew noth about it
inde he said speak from the few word mr murdston
droppeda a man frequent doe on these occasionsand from what miss
murdston let fall i should sai it wa rather a good marriag
do you mean that there is monei sir i ask
ye said mr spenlow i understand there monei beauti too i am
told
inde is hi new wife young
just of ag said mr spenlow so late that i should think thei
had been wait for that
lord deliv her said peggotti so veri emphat and
unexpectedli that we were all three discompos until tiffei came in
with the bill
old tiffei soon appear howev and hand it to mr spenlow to
look over mr spenlow settl hi chin in hi cravat and rub it
softli went over the item with a deprecatori aira if it were all
jorkinss doingand hand it back to tiffei with a bland sigh
ye he said that right quit right i should have been extrem
happi copperfield to have limit these charg to the actual
expenditur out of pocket but it is an irksom incid in my
profession life that i am not at liberti to consult my own wish i
have a partnermr jorkin
as he said thi with a gentl melancholi which wa the next thing to
make no charg at all i express my acknowledg on peggotti
behalf and paid tiffei in banknot peggotti then retir to
her lodg and mr spenlow and i went into court where we had a
divorcesuit come on under an ingeni littl statut repeal
now i believ but in virtu of which i have seen sever marriag
annul of which the merit were these the husband whose name wa
thoma benjamin had taken out hi marriag licenc as thoma onli
suppress the benjamin in case he should not find himself as
comfort as he expect not find himself as comfort as he
expect or be a littl fatigu with hi wife poor fellow he
now came forward by a friend after be marri a year or two and
declar that hi name wa thoma benjamin and therefor he wa not
marri at all which the court confirm to hi great satisfact
i must sai that i had my doubt about the strict justic of thi
and wa not even frighten out of them by the bushel of wheat which
reconcil all anomali but mr spenlow argu the matter with me he
said look at the world there wa good and evil in that look at the
ecclesiast law there wa good and evil in that it wa all part of
a system veri good there you were
i had not the hardihood to suggest to dora father that possibl
we might even improv the world a littl if we got up earli in the
morn and took off our coat to the work but i confess that i
thought we might improv the common mr spenlow repli that he would
particularli advis me to dismiss that idea from my mind as not be
worthi of my gentlemanli charact but that he would be glad to hear
from me of what improv i thought the common suscept
take that part of the common which happen to be nearest to usfor
our man wa unmarri by thi time and we were out of court and
stroll past the prerog officei submit that i thought the
prerog offic rather a queerli manag institut mr spenlow
inquir in what respect i repli with all due defer to hi
experi but with more defer i am afraid to hi be dora
father that perhap it wa a littl nonsens that the registri of
that court contain the origin will of all person leav effect
within the immens provinc of canterburi for three whole centuri
should be an accident build never design for the purpos leas
by the registrar for their own privat emolu unsaf not even
ascertain to be fireproof choke with the import document
it held and posit from the roof to the basement a mercenari
specul of the registrar who took great fee from the public and
cram the public will awai anyhow and anywher have no other
object than to get rid of them cheapli that perhap it wa a littl
unreason that these registrar in the receipt of profit amount
to eight or nine thousand pound a year to sai noth of the profit
of the deputi registrar and clerk of seat should not be oblig to
spend a littl of that monei in find a reason safe place for the
import document which all class of peopl were compel to hand
over to them whether thei would or no that perhap it wa a littl
unjust that all the great offic in thi great offic should be
magnific sinecur while the unfortun workingclerk in the cold
dark room upstair were the worst reward and the least consid
men do import servic in london that perhap it wa a littl
indec that the princip registrar of all whose duti it wa to
find the public constantli resort to thi place all need
accommod should be an enorm sinecurist in virtu of that post
and might be besid a clergyman a pluralist the holder of a
staff in a cathedr and what notwhil the public wa put to the
inconveni of which we had a specimen everi afternoon when the offic
wa busi and which we knew to be quit monstrou that perhap
in short thi prerog offic of the dioces of canterburi wa
altogeth such a pestil job and such a pernici absurd that
but for it be squeez awai in a corner of st paul churchyard
which few peopl knew it must have been turn complet insid out
and upsid down long ago
mr spenlow smile as i becam modestli warm on the subject and then
argu thi question with me as he had argu the other he said what
wa it after all it wa a question of feel if the public felt
that their will were in safe keep and took it for grant that the
offic wa not to be made better who wa the wors for it nobodi who
wa the better for it all the sinecurist veri well then the good
predomin it might not be a perfect system noth wa perfect
but what he object to wa the insert of the wedg under the
prerog offic the countri had been gloriou insert the wedg into
the prerog offic and the countri would ceas to be gloriou he
consid it the principl of a gentleman to take thing as he found
them and he had no doubt the prerog offic would last our time i
defer to hi opinion though i had great doubt of it myself i find
he wa right howev for it ha not onli last to the present moment
but ha done so in the teeth of a great parliamentari report made not
too willingli eighteen year ago when all these object of mine
were set forth in detail and when the exist stowag for will wa
describ as equal to the accumul of onli two year and a half
more what thei have done with them sinc whether thei have lost mani
or whether thei sell ani now and then to the butter shop i dont
know i am glad mine is not there and i hope it mai not go there yet
awhil
i have set all thi down in my present bliss chapter becaus here
it come into it natur place mr spenlow and i fall into thi
convers prolong it and our saunter to and fro until we diverg
into gener topic and so it came about in the end that mr spenlow
told me thi dai week wa dora birthdai and he would be glad if i
would come down and join a littl picnic on the occas i went out of
my sens immedi becam a mere drivel next dai on receipt of
a littl laceedg sheet of notepap favour by papa to remind
and pass the interven period in a state of dotag
i think i commit everi possibl absurd in the wai of prepar
for thi bless event i turn hot when i rememb the cravat i bought
my boot might be place in ani collect of instrument of tortur
i provid and sent down by the norwood coach the night befor a
delic littl hamper amount in itself i thought almost to a
declar there were cracker in it with the tenderest motto that
could be got for monei at six in the morn i wa in covent garden
market bui a bouquet for dora at ten i wa on horseback i hire a
gallant grei for the occas with the bouquet in my hat to keep it
fresh trot down to norwood
i suppos that when i saw dora in the garden and pretend not to see
her and rode past the hous pretend to be anxious look for
it i commit two small fooleri which other young gentlemen in my
circumst might have committedbecaus thei came so veri natur
to me but oh when i did find the hous and did dismount at the
gardeng and drag those stonyheart boot across the lawn to dora
sit on a gardenseat under a lilac tree what a spectacl she wa
upon that beauti morn among the butterfli in a white chip
bonnet and a dress of celesti blue there wa a young ladi with
hercompar stricken in yearsalmost twenti i should sai her
name wa miss mill and dora call her julia she wa the bosom friend
of dora happi miss mill
jip wa there and jip would bark at me again when i present my
bouquet he gnash hi teeth with jealousi well he might if he had
the least idea how i ador hi mistress well he might
oh thank you mr copperfield what dear flower said dora
i had had an intent of sai and had been studi the best form of
word for three mile that i thought them beauti befor i saw them
so near her but i couldnt manag it she wa too bewild to see
her lai the flower against her littl dimpl chin wa to lose all
presenc of mind and power of languag in a feebl ecstasi i wonder i
didnt sai kill me if you have a heart miss mill let me die here
then dora held my flower to jip to smell then jip growl and
wouldnt smell them then dora laugh and held them a littl closer
to jip to make him then jip laid hold of a bit of geranium with hi
teeth and worri imaginari cat in it then dora beat him and pout
and said my poor beauti flower as compassion i thought as
if jip had laid hold of me i wish he had
youll be so glad to hear mr copperfield said dora that that
cross miss murdston is not here she ha gone to her brother
marriag and will be awai at least three week isnt that delight
i said i wa sure it must be delight to her and all that wa
delight to her wa delight to me miss mill with an air of
superior wisdom and benevol smile upon us
she is the most disagre thing i ever saw said dora you cant
believ how illtemp and shock she is julia
ye i can my dear said julia
you can perhap love return dora with her hand on julia
forgiv my not except you my dear at first
i learnt from thi that miss mill had had her trial in the cours
of a chequer exist and that to these perhap i might refer that
wise benign of manner which i had alreadi notic i found in
the cours of the dai that thi wa the case miss mill have been
unhappi in a misplac affect and be understood to have retir
from the world on her aw stock of experi but still to take a
calm interest in the unblight hope and love of youth
but now mr spenlow came out of the hous and dora went to him
sai look papa what beauti flower and miss mill smile
thoughtfulli as who should sai ye mayfli enjoi your brief
exist in the bright morn of life and we all walk from the
lawn toward the carriag which wa get readi
i shall never have such a ride again i have never had such anoth
there were onli those three their hamper my hamper and the
guitarcas in the phaeton and of cours the phaeton wa open and
i rode behind it and dora sat with her back to the hors look
toward me she kept the bouquet close to her on the cushion and
wouldnt allow jip to sit on that side of her at all for fear he should
crush it she often carri it in her hand often refresh herself
with it fragranc our ey at those time often met and my great
astonish is that i didnt go over the head of my gallant grei into
the carriag
there wa dust i believ there wa a good deal of dust i believ i
have a faint impress that mr spenlow remonstr with me for ride
in it but i knew of none i wa sensibl of a mist of love and beauti
about dora but of noth els he stood up sometim and ask me
what i thought of the prospect i said it wa delight and i dare
sai it wa but it wa all dora to me the sun shone dora and the bird
sang dora the south wind blew dora and the wild flower in the hedg
were all dora to a bud my comfort is miss mill understood me miss
mill alon could enter into my feel thoroughli
i dont know how long we were go and to thi hour i know as littl
where we went perhap it wa near guildford perhap some arabiannight
magician open up the place for the dai and shut it up for ever when
we came awai it wa a green spot on a hill carpet with soft turf
there were shadi tree and heather and as far as the ey could see a
rich landscap
it wa a try thing to find peopl here wait for us and my
jealousi even of the ladi knew no bound but all of my own
sexespeci on impostor three or four year my elder with a red
whisker on which he establish an amount of presumpt not to be
enduredwer my mortal foe
we all unpack our basket and emploi ourselv in get dinner
readi red whisker pretend he could make a salad which i dont
believ and obtrud himself on public notic some of the young
ladi wash the lettuc for him and slice them under hi
direct dora wa among these i felt that fate had pit me against
thi man and on of us must fall
red whisker made hi salad i wonder how thei could eat it noth
should have induc me to touch it and vote himself into the charg
of the winecellar which he construct be an ingeni beast in
the hollow trunk of a tree by and by i saw him with the major of a
lobster on hi plate eat hi dinner at the feet of dora
i have but an indistinct idea of what happen for some time after thi
bale object present itself to my view i wa veri merri i know
but it wa hollow merriment i attach myself to a young creatur in
pink with littl ey and flirt with her desper she receiv
my attent with favour but whether on my account sole or becaus
she had ani design on red whisker i cant sai dora health wa
drunk when i drank it i affect to interrupt my convers for that
purpos and to resum it immedi afterward i caught dora ey as
i bow to her and i thought it look appeal but it look at me
over the head of red whisker and i wa adam
the young creatur in pink had a mother in green and i rather think the
latter separ us from motiv of polici howbeit there wa a gener
break up of the parti while the remnant of the dinner were be
put awai and i stroll off by myself among the tree in a rage and
remors state i wa debat whether i should pretend that i wa not
well and flyi dont know whereupon my gallant grei when dora and
miss mill met me
mr copperfield said miss mill you ar dull
i beg her pardon not at all
and dora said miss mill you ar dull
oh dear no not in the least
mr copperfield and dora said miss mill with an almost vener
air enough of thi do not allow a trivial misunderstand to wither
the blossom of spring which onc put forth and blight cannot be
renew i speak said miss mill from experi of the pastth
remot irrevoc past the gush fountain which sparkl in the
sun must not be stop in mere capric the oasi in the desert of
sahara must not be pluck up idli
i hardli knew what i did i wa burn all over to that extraordinari
extent but i took dora littl hand and kiss itand she let me
i kiss miss millss hand and we all seem to my think to go
straight up to the seventh heaven we did not come down again we stai
up there all the even at first we strai to and fro among the
tree i with dora shy arm drawn through mine and heaven know
folli as it all wa it would have been a happi fate to have been struck
immort with those foolish feel and have stai among the tree
for ever
but much too soon we heard the other laugh and talk and
call where dora so we went back and thei want dora to sing
red whisker would have got the guitarcas out of the carriag but dora
told him nobodi knew where it wa but i so red whisker wa done for
in a moment and i got it and i unlock it and i took the guitar out
and i sat by her and i held her handkerchief and glove and i drank in
everi note of her dear voic and she sang to me who love her and all
the other might applaud as much as thei like but thei had noth to
do with it
i wa intox with joi i wa afraid it wa too happi to be real
and that i should wake in buckingham street present and hear mr
crupp clink the teacup in get breakfast readi but dora sang
and other sang and miss mill sangabout the slumber echo in the
cavern of memori as if she were a hundr year oldand the even
came on and we had tea with the kettl boil gipsyfashion and i
wa still as happi as ever
i wa happier than ever when the parti broke up and the other peopl
defeat red whisker and all went their sever wai and we went our
through the still even and the dy light with sweet scent
rise up around us mr spenlow be a littl drowsi after the
champagnehonour to the soil that grew the grape to the grape that
made the wine to the sun that ripen it and to the merchant who
adulter itand be fast asleep in a corner of the carriag i
rode by the side and talk to dora she admir my hors and pat
himoh what a dear littl hand it look upon a horseand her shawl
would not keep right and now and then i drew it round her with my arm
and i even fanci that jip began to see how it wa and to understand
that he must make up hi mind to be friend with me
that sagaci miss mill too that amiabl though quit us up
reclus that littl patriarch of someth less than twenti who had
done with the world and mustnt on ani account have the slumber
echo in the cavern of memori awaken what a kind thing she did
mr copperfield said miss mill come to thi side of the carriag a
momentif you can spare a moment i want to speak to you

millss head and store miss millss address in the securest corner of
my memori what could i do but tell miss mill with grate look
and fervent word how much i appreci her good offic and what an
inestim valu i set upon her friendship
then miss mill benignantli dismiss me sai go back to dora and
i went and dora lean out of the carriag to talk to me and we talk
all the rest of the wai and i rode my gallant grei so close to the
wheel that i graze hi near fore leg against it and took the bark
off as hi owner told me to the tune of three pun sivinwhich i
paid and thought extrem cheap for so much joi what time miss mill
sat look at the moon murmur versesand recal i suppos the
ancient dai when she and earth had anyth in common

but mr spenlow came to himself a littl short of it and said
you must come in copperfield and rest and i consent we had
sandwich and wineandwat in the light room dora blush look
so love that i could not tear myself awai but sat there stare in
a dream until the snore of mr spenlow inspir me with suffici
conscious to take my leav so we part i ride all the wai
to london with the farewel touch of dora hand still light on mine
recal everi incid and word ten thousand time ly down in my

other question that i knew of in the world and onli dora could give the
answer to it i pass three dai in a luxuri of wretched tortur

for the purpos at a vast expens i went to miss millss fraught with
a declar

squarepainfulli awar of be a much better answer to the old riddl
than the origin onebefor i could persuad myself to go up the step
and knock is no matter now even when at last i had knock and wa
wait at the door i had some flurri thought of ask if that

retreat but i kept my ground
mr mill wa not at home i did not expect he would be nobodi want

miss mill wa veri glad to see me and veri sorri her papa wa not at
home though i thought we all bore that with fortitud miss mill wa
convers for a few minut and then lai down her pen upon
affect dirg got up and left the room
i began to think i would put it off till tomorrow
i hope your poor hors wa not tire when he got home at night said
dora lift up her beauti ey it wa a long wai for him
i began to think i would do it todai
it wa a long wai for him said i for he had noth to uphold him
on the journei
wasnt he fed poor thing ask dora
i began to think i would put it off till tomorrow
yey i said he wa well taken care of i mean he had not the
unutter happi that i had in be so near you
dora bent her head over her draw and said after a littl whilei
had sat in the interv in a burn fever and with my leg in a veri
rigid state
you didnt seem to be sensibl of that happi yourself at on time
of the dai
i saw now that i wa in for it and it must be done on the spot
you didnt care for that happi in the least said dora slightli
rais her eyebrow and shake her head when you were sit by
miss kitt
kitt i should observ wa the name of the creatur in pink with the
littl ey
though certainli i dont know why you should said dora or why you
should call it a happi at all but of cours you dont mean what you

you like jip you naughti boi come here
i dont know how i did it i did it in a moment i intercept jip
i had dora in my arm i wa full of eloqu i never stop for a
word i told her how i love her i told her i should die without her
i told her that i idol and worship her jip bark madli all the
time
when dora hung her head and cri and trembl my eloqu increas
so much the more if she would like me to die for her she had but to
sai the word and i wa readi life without dora love wa not a thing
to have on ani term i couldnt bear it and i wouldnt i had love

got more mad everi moment
well well dora and i were sit on the sofa by and by quiet enough
and jip wa ly in her lap wink peacefulli at me it wa off my
mind i wa in a state of perfect raptur dora and i were engag
i suppos we had some notion that thi wa to end in marriag we must
have had some becaus dora stipul that we were never to be marri
without her papa consent but in our youth ecstasi i dont think
that we realli look befor us or behind us or had ani aspir
beyond the ignor present we were to keep our secret from mr
spenlow but i am sure the idea never enter my head then that there
wa anyth dishonour in that
miss mill wa more than usual pensiv when dora go to find her
brought her backi apprehend becaus there wa a tendenc in what had
pass to awaken the slumber echo in the cavern of memori but she
gave us her bless and the assur of her last friendship and
spoke to us gener as becam a voic from the cloister
what an idl time it wa what an insubstanti happi foolish time it
wa
when i measur dora finger for a ring that wa to be made of
forgetmenot and when the jewel to whom i took the measur found
me out and laugh over hi orderbook and charg me anyth he
like for the pretti littl toi with it blue stonesso associ
in my remembr with dora hand that yesterdai when i saw such
anoth by chanc on the finger of my own daughter there wa a
momentari stir in my heart like pain
when i walk about exalt with my secret and full of my own
interest and felt the digniti of love dora and of be belov so
much that if i had walk the air i could not have been more abov the
peopl not so situat who were creep on the earth
when we had those meet in the garden of the squar and sat within
the dingi summerhous so happi that i love the london sparrow to
thi hour for noth els and see the plumag of the tropic in their
smoki feather when we had our first great quarrel within a week
of our betroth and when dora sent me back the ring enclos in a
despair cockedhat note wherein she us the terribl express
that our love had begun in folli and end in mad which dread
word occas me to tear my hair and cry that all wa over
when under cover of the night i flew to miss mill whom i saw by
stealth in a back kitchen where there wa a mangl and implor miss
mill to interpos between us and avert insan when miss mill
undertook the offic and return with dora exhort us from the
pulpit of her own bitter youth to mutual concess and the avoid
of the desert of sahara
when we cri and made it up and were so blest again that the back
kitchen mangl and all chang to love own templ where we arrang
a plan of correspond through miss mill alwai to comprehend at
least on letter on each side everi dai
what an idl time what an insubstanti happi foolish time of all
the time of mine that time ha in hi grip there is none that in on
retrospect i can smile at half so much and think of half so tenderli
chapter 34 my aunt astonish me
i wrote to agn as soon as dora and i were engag i wrote her a long
letter in which i tri to make her comprehend how blest i wa and
what a darl dora wa i entreat agn not to regard thi as a
thoughtless passion which could ever yield to ani other or had the
least resembl to the boyish fanci that we us to joke about i
assur her that it profund wa quit unfathom and express my
belief that noth like it had ever been known
somehow as i wrote to agn on a fine even by my open window and
the remembr of her clear calm ey and gentl face came steal
over me it shed such a peac influenc upon the hurri and agit
in which i had been live late and of which my veri happi
partook in some degre that it sooth me into tear i rememb that
i sat rest my head upon my hand when the letter wa half done
cherish a gener fanci as if agn were on of the element of my
natur home as if in the retir of the hous made almost sacr
to me by her presenc dora and i must be happier than anywher as if
in love joi sorrow hope or disappoint in all emot my heart
turn natur there and found it refug and best friend
of steerforth i said noth i onli told her there had been sad grief
at yarmouth on account of emili flight and that on me it made a
doubl wound by reason of the circumst attend it i knew how
quick she alwai wa to divin the truth and that she would never be
the first to breath hi name
to thi letter i receiv an answer by return of post as i read it i
seem to hear agn speak to me it wa like her cordial voic in my
ear what can i sai more

alwai volunt that inform to whomsoev would receiv
it that she wa my old nurs he had establish a goodhumour
acquaint with her and had stai to have a littl chat with her
about me so peggotti said but i am afraid the chat wa all on her
own side and of immoder length as she wa veri difficult inde to
stop god bless her when she had me for her theme

afternoon of hi own appoint which wa now come but that mr crupp

had a right to pleas himself so let him do all that she mr crupp
stipul for wa that she should not be brought in contract

sophi flowerpot and stand
what a hard thing i exclaim indignantli
it wa ait wa a pull said traddl with hi usual winc at that
express i dont mention it reproachfulli howev but with a
motiv the fact is copperfield i wa unabl to repurchas them at the
time of their seizur in the first place becaus the broker have an
idea that i want them ran the price up to an extravag extent and
in the second place becaus ihadnt ani monei now i have kept
my ey sinc upon the broker shop said traddl with a great
enjoy of hi mysteri which is up at the top of tottenham court
road and at last todai i find them put out for sale i have onli
notic them from over the wai becaus if the broker saw me bless you
hed ask ani price for them what ha occur to me have now the
monei is that perhap you wouldnt object to ask that good nurs of
your to come with me to the shopi can show it her from round the
corner of the next streetand make the best bargain for them as if
thei were for herself that she can
the delight with which traddl propound thi plan to me and the
sens he had of it uncommon art ar among the freshest thing
in my remembr
i told him that my old nurs would be delight to assist him and that
we would all three take the field togeth but on on condit that
condit wa that he should make a solemn resolut to grant no more
loan of hi name or anyth els to mr micawb

i begin to feel that i have not onli been inconsider but that i have
been posit unjust to sophi my word be pass to myself there
is no longer ani apprehens but i pledg it to you too with the
greatest readi that first unlucki oblig i have paid i have

he dont tell me that it is provid for but he sai it will be now i
think there is someth veri fair and honest about that
i wa unwil to damp my good friend confid and therefor
assent after a littl further convers we went round to the
chandler shop to enlist peggotti traddl declin to pass the
even with me both becaus he endur the liveliest apprehens
that hi properti would be bought by somebodi els befor he could

chapter 35 depress
as soon as i could recov my presenc of mind which quit desert me
in the first overpow shock of my aunt intellig i propos
to mr dick to come round to the chandler shop and take possess of
the bed which mr peggotti had late vacat the chandler shop be
in hungerford market and hungerford market be a veri differ place
in those dai there wa a low wooden colonnad befor the door not
veri unlik that befor the hous where the littl man and woman us
to live in the old weatherglass which pleas mr dick mightili the
glori of lodg over thi structur would have compens him i dare
sai for mani inconveni but as there were realli few to bear
beyond the compound of flavour i have alreadi mention and perhap
the want of a littl more elbowroom he wa perfectli charm with hi
accommod mr crupp had indignantli assur him that there wasnt
room to swing a cat there but as mr dick justli observ to me
sit down on the foot of the bed nurs hi leg you know
trotwood i dont want to swing a cat i never do swing a cat
therefor what doe that signifi to me
i tri to ascertain whether mr dick had ani understand of the
caus of thi sudden and great chang in my aunt affair as i might
have expect he had none at all the onli account he could give of it
wa that my aunt had said to him the dai befor yesterdai now dick
ar you realli and truli the philosoph i take you for that then
he had said ye he hope so that then my aunt had said dick i
am ruin that then he had said oh inde that then my aunt had
prais him highli which he wa glad of and that then thei had come to
me and had had bottl porter and sandwich on the road
mr dick wa so veri complac sit on the foot of the bed nurs
hi leg and tell me thi with hi ey wide open and a surpris
smile that i am sorri to sai i wa provok into explain to him
that ruin meant distress want and starvat but i wa soon bitterli
reprov for thi harsh by see hi face turn pale and tear
cours down hi lengthen cheek while he fix upon me a look of such
unutter woe that it might have soften a far harder heart than
mine i took infinit greater pain to cheer him up again than i had
taken to depress him and i soon understood as i ought to have known at
first that he had been so confid mere becaus of hi faith in
the wisest and most wonder of women and hi unbound relianc on my
intellectu resourc the latter i believ he consid a match for
ani kind of disast not absolut mortal
what can we do trotwood said mr dick there the memori
to be sure there is said i but all we can do just now mr dick
is to keep a cheer counten and not let my aunt see that we ar
think about it
he assent to thi in the most earnest manner and implor me if i
should see him wander an inch out of the right cours to recal him
by some of those superior method which were alwai at my command but i
regret to state that the fright i had given him prove too much for hi
best attempt at conceal all the even hi ey wander to my
aunt face with an express of the most dismal apprehens as if
he saw her grow thin on the spot he wa consciou of thi and put
a constraint upon hi head but hi keep that immov and sit
roll hi ey like a piec of machineri did not mend the matter at
all i saw him look at the loaf at supper which happen to be a small
on as if noth els stood between us and famin and when my aunt
insist on hi make hi customari repast i detect him in the act
of pocket fragment of hi bread and chees i have no doubt for the
purpos of reviv us with those save when we should have reach
an advanc stage of attenu
my aunt on the other hand wa in a compos frame of mind which wa
a lesson to all of usto me i am sure she wa extrem graciou
to peggotti except when i inadvert call her by that name and
strang as i knew she felt in london appear quit at home she wa
to have my bed and i wa to lie in the sittingroom to keep guard over
her she made a great point of be so near the river in case of a
conflagr and i suppos realli did find some satisfact in that

selfish as i knew it wa and as i tortur myself by know that it
wa to let my mind run on my own distress so much i wa so devot
to dora that i could not help it i knew that it wa base in me not to
think more of my aunt and less of myself but so far selfish
wa insepar from dora and i could not put dora on on side for ani
mortal creatur how exceedingli miser i wa that night
as to sleep i had dream of poverti in all sort of shape but i
seem to dream without the previou ceremoni of go to sleep now i
wa rag want to sell dora match six bundl for a halfpenni
now i wa at the offic in a nightgown and boot remonstr with by
mr spenlow on appear befor the client in that airi attir now

common reject and still more or less consciou of my own room i
wa alwai toss about like a distress ship in a sea of bedcloth
my aunt wa restless too for i frequent heard her walk to and
fro two or three time in the cours of the night attir in a long
flannel wrapper in which she look seven feet high she appear like
a disturb ghost in my room and came to the side of the sofa on which
i lai on the first occas i start up in alarm to learn that she
infer from a particular light in the sky that westminst abbei
wa on fire and to be consult in refer to the probabl of it
ignit buckingham street in case the wind chang ly still after
that i found that she sat down near me whisper to herself poor
boi and then it made me twenti time more wretch to know how
unselfishli mind she wa of me and how selfishli mind i wa of
myself
it wa difficult to believ that a night so long to me could be short
to anybodi els thi consider set me think and think of an
imaginari parti where peopl were danc the hour awai until that
becam a dream too and i heard the music incessantli plai on tune
and saw dora incessantli danc on danc without take the least
notic of me the man who had been plai the harp all night wa
try in vain to cover it with an ordinarys nightcap when i

and saw the sun shine in through the window at last
there wa an old roman bath in those dai at the bottom of on of the
street out of the strandit mai be there stillin which i have had
mani a cold plung dress myself as quietli as i could and leav
peggotti to look after my aunt i tumbl head foremost into it
and then went for a walk to hampstead i had a hope that thi brisk
treatment might freshen my wit a littl and i think it did them good
for i soon came to the conclus that the first step i ought to take
wa to try if my articl could be cancel and the premium recov
i got some breakfast on the heath and walk back to doctor common
along the water road and through a pleasant smell of summer flower
grow in garden and carri into town on huckster head intent on

do is to live the term out here and get a bedroom hard by
i thought it my duti to hint at the discomfort my aunt would sustain
from live in a continu state of guerilla warfar with mr crupp
but she dispos of that object summarili by declar that on the
first demonstr of hostil she wa prepar to astonish mr
crupp for the whole remaind of her natur life

hour and hour i had devot to fag about town and to and fro upon
the norwood road i have abund of time
i know you would not mind said agn come to me and speak in
a low voic so full of sweet and hope consider that i hear it
now the duti of a secretari
mind my dear agn
becaus continu agn doctor strong ha act on hi intent of
retir and ha come to live in london and he ask papa i know
if he could recommend him on dont you think he would rather have hi
favourit old pupil near him than anybodi els
dear agn said i what should i do without you you ar alwai my
good angel i told you so i never think of you in ani other light
agn answer with her pleasant laugh that on good angel mean
dora wa enough and went on to remind me that the doctor had been
us to occupi himself in hi studi earli in the morn and in the
eveningand that probabl my leisur would suit hi requir veri
well i wa scarc more delight with the prospect of earn my own
bread than with the hope of earn it under my old master in short
act on the advic of agn i sat down and wrote a letter to the
doctor state my object and appoint to call on him next dai at
ten in the forenoon thi i address to highgatefor in that place so
memor to me he livedand went and post myself without lose a
minut
wherev agn wa some agreeabl token of her noiseless presenc
seem insepar from the place when i came back i found my aunt
bird hang just as thei had hung so long in the parlour window of
the cottag and my easychair imit my aunt much easier chair in
it posit at the open window and even the round green fan which my
aunt had brought awai with her screw on to the windowsil i knew
who had done all thi by it seem to have quietli done itself and i
should have known in a moment who had arrang my neglect book in the
old order of my school dai even if i had suppos agn to be mile
awai instead of see her busi with them and smile at the disord
into which thei had fallen
my aunt wa quit graciou on the subject of the thame it realli did
look veri well with the sun upon it though not like the sea befor the
cottag but she could not relent toward the london smoke which she
said pepper everyth a complet revolut in which peggotti
bore a promin part wa be effect in everi corner of my room
in regard of thi pepper and i wa look on think how littl even
peggotti seem to do with a good deal of bustl and how much agn did
without ani bustl at all when a knock came at the door
i think said agn turn pale it papa he promis me that he
would come
i open the door and admit not onli mr wickfield but uriah heep
i had not seen mr wickfield for some time i wa prepar for a great
chang in him after what i had heard from agn but hi appear
shock me
it wa not that he look mani year older though still dress
with the old scrupul cleanli or that there wa an unwholesom
ruddi upon hi face or that hi ey were full and bloodshot or
that there wa a nervou trembl in hi hand the caus of which i
knew and had for some year seen at work it wa not that he had lost
hi good look or hi old bear of a gentlemanfor that he had
notbut the thing that struck me most wa that with the evid of
hi nativ superior still upon him he should submit himself to that
crawl imperson of mean uriah heep the revers of the
two natur in their rel posit uriah of power and mr
wickfield of depend wa a sight more pain to me than i can
express if i had seen an ap take command of a man i should hardli
have thought it a more degrad spectacl
he appear to be onli too consciou of it himself when he came in he
stood still and with hi head bow as if he felt it thi wa
onli for a moment for agn softli said to him papa here is miss
trotwoodand trotwood whom you have not seen for a long while and
then he approach and constrainedli gave my aunt hi hand and shook
hand more cordial with me in the moment paus i speak of i saw
uriah counten form itself into a most illfavour smile agn
saw it too i think for she shrank from him
what my aunt saw or did not see i defi the scienc of physiognomi
to have made out without her own consent i believ there never wa
anybodi with such an imperturb counten when she chose her face
might have been a deadwal on the occas in question for ani light
it threw upon her thought until she broke silenc with her usual
abrupt
well wickfield said my aunt and he look up at her for the first
time i have been tell your daughter how well i have been dispos
of my monei for myself becaus i couldnt trust it to you as you were
grow rusti in busi matter we have been take counsel togeth

head as if she were make snap or bounc at him but he said to me
asid in a meek voic

dull voic it a load off my mind trotwood to have such a partner

light he had indic on the night when he poison my rest i saw the
same illfavour smile upon hi face again and saw how he watch me

hear us recal the littl incid of our old life mani of which he
rememb veri well he said it wa like those time to be alon with
agn and me again and he wish to heaven thei had never chang i am
sure there wa an influenc in the placid face of agn and in the veri
touch of her hand upon hi arm that did wonder for him
my aunt who wa busi nearli all thi while with peggotti in the inner
room would not accompani us to the place where thei were stai but
insist on my go and i went we dine togeth after dinner agn

gave him and no morelik a childand we all three sat togeth at a
window as the even gather in when it wa almost dark he lai down
on a sofa agn pillow hi head and bend over him a littl while
and when she came back to the window it wa not so dark but i could see
tear glitter in her ey
i prai heaven that i never mai forget the dear girl in her love and
truth at that time of my life for if i should i must be draw near
the end and then i would desir to rememb her best she fill my
heart with such good resolut strengthen my weak so by her
exampl so directedi know not how she wa too modest and gentl
to advis me in mani wordsth wander ardour and unsettl purpos
within me that all the littl good i have done and all the harm i have
forborn i solemnli believ i mai refer to her
and how she spoke to me of dora sit at the window in the dark
listen to my prais of her prais again and round the littl
fairyfigur shed some glimps of her own pure light that made it yet
more preciou and more innoc to me oh agn sister of my boyhood
if i had known then what i knew long afterward
there wa a beggar in the street when i went down and as i turn my
head toward the window think of her calm seraph ey he made me
start by mutter as if he were an echo of the morn blind blind

chapter 36 enthusiasm
i began the next dai with anoth dive into the roman bath and then
start for highgat i wa not dispirit now i wa not afraid of the
shabbi coat and had no yearn after gallant grei my whole manner
of think of our late misfortun wa chang what i had to do wa
to show my aunt that her past good to me had not been thrown awai
on an insens ungrat object what i had to do wa to turn the
pain disciplin of my younger dai to account by go to work with
a resolut and steadi heart what i had to do wa to take my woodman
ax in my hand and clear my own wai through the forest of difficulti
by cut down the tree until i came to dora and i went on at a
mighti rate as if it could be done by walk

break stone upon the road to lend me hi hammer for a littl while
and let me begin to beat a path to dora out of granit i stimul
myself into such a heat and got so out of breath that i felt as if i

it narrowlyfor i felt it necessari to be practic it would do for
me and dora admir with a littl front garden for jip to run about
in and bark at the tradespeopl through the rail and a capit
room upstair for my aunt i came out again hotter and faster than

tabl togeth we had not been seat long when i saw an approach
arriv in mr strong face befor i heard ani sound of it a
gentleman on horseback came to the gate and lead hi hors into the
littl court with the bridl over hi arm as if he were quit at home
ti him to a ring in the empti coachhous wall and came into the
breakfast parlour whip in hand it wa mr jack maldon and mr jack
maldon wa not at all improv by india i thought i wa in a state
of feroci virtu howev as to young men who were not cut down
tree in the forest of difficulti and my impress must be receiv
with due allow
mr jack said the doctor copperfield
mr jack maldon shook hand with me but not veri warmli i believ
and with an air of languid patronag at which i secretli took great
umbrag but hi languor altogeth wa quit a wonder sight except
when he address himself to hi cousin anni have you breakfast
thi morn mr jack said the doctor
i hardli ever take breakfast sir he repli with hi head thrown
back in an easychair i find it bore me
is there ani new todai inquir the doctor
noth at all sir repli mr maldon there an account about
the peopl be hungri and discont down in the north but thei ar
alwai be hungri and discont somewher
the doctor look grave and said as though he wish to chang the
subject then there no new at all and no new thei sai is good
new
there a long statement in the paper sir about a murder observ
mr maldon but somebodi is alwai be murder and i didnt read
it
a displai of indiffer to all the action and passion of mankind wa
not suppos to be such a distinguish qualiti at that time i think
as i have observ it to be consid sinc i have known it veri
fashion inde i have seen it displai with such success that i
have encount some fine ladi and gentlemen who might as well have
been born caterpillar perhap it impress me the more then becaus
it wa new to me but it certainli did not tend to exalt my opinion of
or to strengthen my confid in mr jack maldon
i came out to inquir whether anni would like to go to the opera
tonight said mr maldon turn to her it the last good night
there will be thi season and there a singer there whom she realli
ought to hear she is perfectli exquisit besid which she is so
charmingli ugli relaps into languor
the doctor ever pleas with what wa like to pleas hi young wife
turn to her and said
you must go anni you must go
i would rather not she said to the doctor i prefer to remain at
home i would much rather remain at home
without look at her cousin she then address me and ask me about
agn and whether she should see her and whether she wa not like to
come that dai and wa so much disturb that i wonder how even the
doctor butter hi toast could be blind to what wa so obviou
but he saw noth he told her goodnaturedli that she wa young and
ought to be amus and entertain and must not allow herself to be
made dull by a dull old fellow moreov he said he want to hear her
sing all the new singer song to him and how could she do that well
unless she went so the doctor persist in make the engag for
her and mr jack maldon wa to come back to dinner thi conclud he
went to hi patent place i suppos but at all event went awai on hi
hors look veri idl
i wa curiou to find out next morn whether she had been she had
not but had sent into london to put her cousin off and had gone out in
the afternoon to see agn and had prevail upon the doctor to go with
her and thei had walk home by the field the doctor told me the
even be delight i wonder then whether she would have gone
if agn had not been in town and whether agn had some good influenc
over her too
she did not look veri happi i thought but it wa a good face or a
veri fals on i often glanc at it for she sat in the window all the
time we were at work and made our breakfast which we took by snatch
as we were emploi when i left at nine oclock she wa kneel on
the ground at the doctor feet put on hi shoe and gaiter for
him there wa a soften shade upon her face thrown from some green
leav overhang the open window of the low room and i thought all
the wai to doctor common of the night when i had seen it look at
him as he read
i wa pretti busi now up at five in the morn and home at nine
or ten at night but i had infinit satisfact in be so
close engag and never walk slowli on ani account and felt
enthusiast that the more i tire myself the more i wa do to
deserv dora i had not reveal myself in my alter charact to
dora yet becaus she wa come to see miss mill in a few dai and
i defer all i had to tell her until then mere inform her in
my letter all our commun were secretli forward through miss
mill that i had much to tell her in the meantim i put myself on
a short allow of bear greas wholli abandon scent soap and
lavend water and sold off three waistcoat at a prodigi sacrific
as be too luxuri for my stern career
not satisfi with all these proceed but burn with impati
to do someth more i went to see traddl now lodg up behind the
parapet of a hous in castl street holborn mr dick who had been
with me to highgat twice alreadi and had resum hi companionship
with the doctor i took with me
i took mr dick with me becaus acut sensit to my aunt
revers and sincer believ that no galleyslav or convict work
as i did he had begun to fret and worri himself out of spirit and
appetit as have noth us to do in thi condit he felt
more incap of finish the memori than ever and the harder he
work at it the often that unlucki head of king charl the first
got into it serious apprehend that hi maladi would increas
unless we put some innoc decept upon him and caus him to believ
that he wa us or unless we could put him in the wai of be
realli us which would be better i made up my mind to try
if traddl could help us befor we went i wrote traddl a full
statement of all that had happen and traddl wrote me back a capit
answer express of hi sympathi and friendship
we found him hard at work with hi inkstand and paper refresh by the
sight of the flowerpot stand and the littl round tabl in a corner of
the small apart he receiv us cordial and made friend with
mr dick in a moment mr dick profess an absolut certainti of have
seen him befor and we both said veri like
the first subject on which i had to consult traddl wa thisi had
heard that mani men distinguish in variou pursuit had begun life
by report the debat in parliament traddl have mention
newspap to me as on of hi hope i had put the two thing
togeth and told traddl in my letter that i wish to know how i
could qualifi myself for thi pursuit traddl now inform me as the
result of hi inquiri that the mere mechan acquisit necessari
except in rare case for thorough excel in it that is to sai
a perfect and entir command of the mysteri of shorthand write and
read wa about equal in difficulti to the masteri of six languag
and that it might perhap be attain by dint of persever in the
cours of a few year traddl reason suppos that thi would
settl the busi but i onli feel that here inde were a few
tall tree to be hewn down immedi resolv to work my wai on to
dora through thi thicket ax in hand
i am veri much oblig to you my dear traddl said i ill begin
tomorrow
traddl look astonish as he well might but he had no notion as
yet of my raptur condit
ill bui a book said i with a good scheme of thi art in it ill
work at it at the common where i havent half enough to do ill take
down the speech in our court for practicetraddl my dear fellow

dear me said traddl open hi ey i had no idea you were such
a determin charact copperfield
i dont know how he should have had for it wa new enough to me i
pass that off and brought mr dick on the carpet
you see said mr dick wistfulli if i could exert myself mr
traddlesif i could beat a drumor blow anyth
poor fellow i have littl doubt he would have prefer such an
employ in hi heart to all other traddl who would not have
smile for the world repli composedli
but you ar a veri good penman sir you told me so copperfield
excel said i and inde he wa he wrote with extraordinari
neat
dont you think said traddl you could copi write sir if i

suck hi thumb
but these write you know that i speak of ar alreadi drawn up
and finish said traddl after a littl consider mr dick ha
noth to do with them wouldnt that make a differ copperfield
at all event wouldnt it be well to try
thi gave us new hope traddl and i lai our head togeth apart
while mr dick anxious watch us from hi chair we concoct a
scheme in virtu of which we got him to work next dai with triumphant
success
on a tabl by the window in buckingham street we set out the work
traddl procur for himwhich wa to make i forget how mani copi
of a legal document about some right of wayand on anoth tabl
we spread the last unfinish origin of the great memori our
instruct to mr dick were that he should copi exactli what he had
befor him without the least departur from the origin and that when
he felt it necessari to make the slightest allus to king charl the
first he should fly to the memori we exhort him to be resolut
in thi and left my aunt to observ him my aunt report to us
afterward that at first he wa like a man plai the kettledrum
and constantli divid hi attent between the two but that find
thi confus and fatigu him and have hi copi there plainli befor
hi ey he soon sat at it in an orderli businesslik manner and
postpon the memori to a more conveni time in a word although we
took great care that he should have no more to do than wa good for him
and although he did not begin with the begin of a week he earn
by the follow saturdai night ten shill and ninep and never
while i live shall i forget hi go about to all the shop in the
neighbourhood to chang thi treasur into sixpenc or hi bring
them to my aunt arrang in the form of a heart upon a waiter with
tear of joi and pride in hi ey he wa like on under the propiti
influenc of a charm from the moment of hi be usefulli emploi
and if there were a happi man in the world that saturdai night it wa
the grate creatur who thought my aunt the most wonder woman in

i express my opinion that thi wa go in the right direct it
mai be a sacrific said mr micawb to immur onesself in a
cathedr town but sure mr copperfield if it is a sacrific in me
it is much more a sacrific in a man of mr micawb abil
oh you ar go to a cathedr town said i
mr micawb who had been help us all out of the washhandstand
jug repli
to canterburi in fact my dear copperfield i have enter into
arrang by virtu of which i stand pledg and contract to our
friend heep to assist and serv him in the capac ofand to behi
confidenti clerk
i stare at mr micawb who greatli enjoi my surpris
i am bound to state to you he said with an offici air that the
busi habit and the prudent suggest of mr micawb have
in a great measur conduc to thi result the gauntlet to which mr
micawb refer upon a former occas be thrown down in the form
of an advertis wa taken up by my friend heep and led to a mutual
recognit of my friend heep said mr micawb who is a man of
remark shrewd i desir to speak with all possibl respect
my friend heep ha not fix the posit remuner at too high a
figur but he ha made a great deal in the wai of extric from
the pressur of pecuniari difficulti conting on the valu of
my servic and on the valu of those servic i pin my faith such
address and intellig as i chanc to possess said mr micawb
boastfulli disparag himself with the old genteel air will be
devot to my friend heep servic i have alreadi some acquaint
with the lawa a defend on civil processand i shall immedi
appli myself to the commentari of on of the most emin and
remark of our english jurist i believ it is unnecessari to add
that i allud to mr justic blackston
these observ and inde the greater part of the observ
made that even were interrupt by mr micawb discov that
master micawb wa sit on hi boot or hold hi head on with
both arm as if he felt it loos or accident kick traddl under
the tabl or shuffl hi feet over on anoth or produc them
at distanc from himself appar outrag to natur or ly
sidewai with hi hair among the wineglass or develop hi
restless of limb in some other form incompat with the gener
interest of societi and by master micawb receiv those
discoveri in a resent spirit i sat all the while amaz by mr
micawb disclosur and wonder what it meant until mr micawb
resum the thread of the discours and claim my attent
what i particularli request mr micawb to be care of is said
mr micawb that he doe not my dear mr copperfield in appli
himself to thi subordin branch of the law place it out of hi power
to rise ultim to the top of the tree i am convinc that mr
micawb give hi mind to a profess so adapt to hi fertil
resourc and hi flow of languag must distinguish himself now for
exampl mr traddl said mr micawb assum a profound air a
judg or even sai a chancellor doe an individu place himself beyond
the pale of those prefer by enter on such an offic as mr
micawb ha accept
my dear observ mr micawberbut glanc inquisit at
traddl too we have time enough befor us for the consider of
those question
micawb she return no your mistak in life is that you do not
look forward far enough you ar bound in justic to your famili if
not to yourself to take in at a comprehens glanc the extremest
point in the horizon to which your abil mai lead you
mr micawb cough and drank hi punch with an air of exceed
satisfactionstil glanc at traddl as if he desir to have hi
opinion
why the plain state of the case mr micawb said traddl mildli
break the truth to her i mean the real prosaic fact you know
just so said mr micawb my dear mr traddl i wish to be as
prosaic and liter as possibl on a subject of so much import
is said traddl that thi branch of the law even if mr
micawb were a regular solicitor
exactli so return mr micawb wilkin you ar squint and
will not be abl to get your ey back
ha noth pursu traddl to do with that onli a barrist
is elig for such prefer and mr micawb could not be a
barrist without be enter at an inn of court as a student for
five year
do i follow you said mr micawb with her most affabl air
of busi do i understand my dear mr traddl that at the
expir of that period mr micawb would be elig as a judg or
chancellor
he would be elig return traddl with a strong emphasi on
that word
thank you said mr micawb that is quit suffici if such is
the case and mr micawb forfeit no privileg by enter on these
duti my anxieti is set at rest i speak said mr micawb as a
femal necessarili but i have alwai been of opinion that mr micawb
possess what i have heard my papa call when i live at home the
judici mind and i hope mr micawb is now enter on a field where
that mind will develop itself and take a command station
i quit believ that mr micawb saw himself in hi judici mind
ey on the woolsack he pass hi hand complac over hi bald
head and said with ostentati resign
my dear we will not anticip the decre of fortun if i am
reserv to wear a wig i am at least prepar extern in allus
to hi bald for that distinct i do not said mr micawb
regret my hair and i mai have been depriv of it for a specif
purpos i cannot sai it is my intent my dear copperfield to
educ my son for the church i will not deni that i should be happi
on hi account to attain to emin
for the church said i still ponder between while on uriah
heep
ye said mr micawb he ha a remark headvoic and will
commenc as a chorist our resid at canterburi and our local
connexion will no doubt enabl him to take advantag of ani vacanc
that mai aris in the cathedr corp
on look at master micawb again i saw that he had a certain
express of face as if hi voic were behind hi eyebrow where it
present appear to be on hi sing us as an altern between
that and bed the woodpeck tap after mani compliment on thi
perform we fell into some gener convers and as i wa too
full of my desper intent to keep my alter circumst to
myself i made them known to mr and mr micawb i cannot express how
extrem delight thei both were by the idea of my aunt be in
difficulti and how comfort and friendli it made them
when we were nearli come to the last round of the punch i address
myself to traddl and remind him that we must not separ without
wish our friend health happi and success in their new career
i beg mr micawb to fill us bumper and propos the toast in
due form shake hand with him across the tabl and kiss mr
micawb to commemor that event occas traddl imit me
in the first particular but did not consid himself a suffici old
friend to ventur on the second
my dear copperfield said mr micawb rise with on of hi thumb
in each of hi waistcoat pocket the companion of my youth if i mai
be allow the expressionand my esteem friend traddl if i mai be
permit to call him sowil allow me on the part of mr micawb
myself and our offspr to thank them in the warmest and most
uncompromis term for their good wish it mai be expect that
on the ev of a migrat which will consign us to a perfectli new
exist mr micawb spoke as if thei were go five hundr
thousand mile i should offer a few valedictori remark to two such
friend as i see befor me but all that i have to sai in thi wai i
have said whatev station in societi i mai attain through the medium
of the learn profess of which i am about to becom an unworthi
member i shall endeavour not to disgrac and mr micawb will be
safe to adorn under the temporari pressur of pecuniari liabil
contract with a view to their immedi liquid but remain
unliquid through a combin of circumst i have been
under the necess of assum a garb from which my natur instinct
recoili allud to spectaclesand possess myself of a cognomen to
which i can establish no legitim pretens all i have to sai on
that score is that the cloud ha pass from the dreari scene and the
god of dai is onc more high upon the mountain top on mondai next on
the arriv of the four oclock afternoon coach at canterburi my foot
will be on my nativ heathmi name micawb
mr micawb resum hi seat on the close of these remark and
drank two glass of punch in grave success he then said with much
solemn
on thing more i have to do befor thi separ is complet and
that is to perform an act of justic my friend mr thoma traddl
ha on two sever occas put hi name if i mai us a common
express to bill of exchang for my accommod on the first
occas mr thoma traddl wa leftlet me sai in short in the
lurch the fulfil of the second ha not yet arriv the amount of
the first oblig here mr micawb carefulli refer to paper
wa i believ twentythre four nine and a half of the second
accord to my entri of that transact eighteen six two these
sum unit make a total if my calcul is correct amount to
fortyon ten eleven and a half my friend copperfield will perhap do
me the favour to check that total
i did so and found it correct
to leav thi metropoli said mr micawb and my friend mr
thoma traddl without acquit myself of the pecuniari part of thi
oblig would weigh upon my mind to an insupport extent i have
therefor prepar for my friend mr thoma traddl and i now hold
in my hand a document which accomplish the desir object i beg
to hand to my friend mr thoma traddl my iou for fortyon ten
eleven and a half and i am happi to recov my moral digniti and to
know that i can onc more walk erect befor my fellow man
with thi introduct which greatli affect him mr micawb place
hi iou in the hand of traddl and said he wish him well in
everi relat of life i am persuad not onli that thi wa quit
the same to mr micawb as pai the monei but that traddl himself
hardli knew the differ until he had had time to think about it mr
micawb walk so erect befor hi fellow man on the strength of
thi virtuou action that hi chest look half as broad again when he
light us downstair we part with great hearti on both side
and when i had seen traddl to hi own door and wa go home alon
i thought among the other odd and contradictori thing i muse upon
that slipperi as mr micawb wa i wa probabl indebt to some
compassion recollect he retain of me as hi boylodg for
never have been ask by him for monei i certainli should not have
had the moral courag to refus it and i have no doubt he knew that to
hi credit be it written quit as well as i did

ever in those tremend practic resolut that i felt the crisi
requir i continu to walk extrem fast and to have a gener idea
that i wa get on i made it a rule to take as much out of myself
as i possibl could in my wai of do everyth to which i appli

obtain a signal victori over mr crupp by pai her off throw
the first pitcher she plant on the stair out of window and
protect in person up and down the staircas a supernumerari whom
she engag from the outer world these vigor measur struck such
terror to the breast of mr crupp that she subsid into her own
kitchen under the impress that my aunt wa mad my aunt be
suprem indiffer to mr crupp opinion and everybodi els and
rather favour than discourag the idea mr crupp of late the
bold becam within a few dai so faintheart that rather than
encount my aunt upon the staircas she would endeavour to hide her
portli form behind doorsleav visibl howev a wide margin of
flannel pettico would shrink into dark corner thi gave my aunt
such unspeak satisfact that i believ she took a delight in
prowl up and down with her bonnet insan perch on the top of her
head at time when mr crupp wa like to be in the wai
my aunt be uncommonli neat and ingeni made so mani littl
improv in our domest arrang that i seem to be richer
instead of poorer among the rest she convert the pantri into a
dressingroom for me and purchas and embellish a bedstead for my

could i wa the object of her constant solicitud and my poor mother
herself could not have love me better or studi more how to make me
happi
peggotti had consid herself highli privileg in be allow to

well i love her and i went on love her most absorbingli entir
and complet but go on too work pretti hard and busili
keep redhot all the iron i now had in the fire i would sit
sometim of a night opposit my aunt think how i had frighten
dora that time and how i could best make my wai with a guitarcas
through the forest of difficulti until i us to fanci that my head wa
turn quit grei
chapter 38 a dissolut of partnership
i did not allow my resolut with respect to the parliamentari
debat to cool it wa on of the iron i began to heat immedi
and on of the iron i kept hot and hammer at with a persever
i mai honestli admir i bought an approv scheme of the nobl art and
mysteri of stenographi which cost me ten and sixpenc and plung
into a sea of perplex that brought me in a few week to the
confin of distract the chang that were rung upon dot which
in such a posit meant such a thing and in such anoth posit
someth els entir differ the wonder vagari that were
plai by circl the unaccount consequ that result from
mark like fli leg the tremend effect of a curv in a wrong
place not onli troubl my wake hour but reappear befor me in
my sleep when i had grope my wai blindli through these difficulti
and had master the alphabet which wa an egyptian templ in itself
there then appear a process of new horror call arbitrari
charact the most despot charact i have ever known who
insist for instanc that a thing like the begin of a cobweb
meant expect and that a penandink skyrocket stood for
disadvantag when i had fix these wretch in my mind i found
that thei had driven everyth els out of it then begin again i
forgot them while i wa pick them up i drop the other fragment
of the system in short it wa almost heartbreak
it might have been quit heartbreak but for dora who wa the stai
and anchor of my tempestdriven bark everi scratch in the scheme wa
a gnarl oak in the forest of difficulti and i went on cut them
down on after anoth with such vigour that in three or four month
i wa in a condit to make an experi on on of our crack speaker
in the common shall i ever forget how the crack speaker walk off
from me befor i began and left my imbecil pencil stagger about the
paper as if it were in a fit
thi would not do it wa quit clear i wa fly too high and should
never get on so i resort to traddl for advic who suggest
that he should dictat speech to me at a pace and with occasion
stoppag adapt to my weak veri grate for thi friendli aid
i accept the propos and night after night almost everi night for
a long time we had a sort of privat parliament in buckingham street
after i came home from the doctor
i should like to see such a parliament anywher els my aunt and mr
dick repres the govern or the opposit as the case might
be and traddl with the assist of enfield speaker or a
volum of parliamentari orat thunder astonish invect
against them stand by the tabl with hi finger in the page to keep
the place and hi right arm flourish abov hi head traddl as
mr pitt mr fox mr sheridan mr burk lord castlereagh viscount
sidmouth or mr can would work himself into the most violent
heat and deliv the most wither denunci of the profligaci
and corrupt of my aunt and mr dick while i us to sit at a littl
distanc with my notebook on my knee fag after him with all my
might and main the inconsist and reckless of traddl were not
to be exceed by ani real politician he wa for ani descript of
polici in the compass of a week and nail all sort of colour to
everi denomin of mast my aunt look veri like an immov
chancellor of the exchequ would occasion throw in an interrupt
or two as hear or no or oh when the text seem to requir it
which wa alwai a signal to mr dick a perfect countri gentleman
to follow lustili with the same cry but mr dick got tax with
such thing in the cours of hi parliamentari career and wa made
respons for such aw consequ that he becam uncomfort in
hi mind sometim i believ he actual began to be afraid he realli
had been do someth tend to the annihil of the british
constitut and the ruin of the countri
often and often we pursu these debat until the clock point to
midnight and the candl were burn down the result of so much good
practic wa that by and by i began to keep pace with traddl pretti
well and should have been quit triumphant if i had had the least idea
what my note were about but as to read them after i had got them
i might as well have copi the chines inscript of an immens
collect of teachest or the golden charact on all the great red
and green bottl in the chemist shop
there wa noth for it but to turn back and begin all over again it
wa veri hard but i turn back though with a heavi heart and began
labori and method to plod over the same tediou ground at a
snail pace stop to examin minut everi speck in the wai on
all side and make the most desper effort to know these elus
charact by sight wherev i met them i wa alwai punctual at

i submit and with a counten as express as i wa abl to
make it of deject and despair constanc came out of the room miss
murdston heavi eyebrow follow me to the doori sai her eyebrow
rather than her ey becaus thei were much more import in her
faceand she look so exactli as she us to look at about that
hour of the morn in our parlour at blunderston that i could have
fanci i had been break down in my lesson again and that the
dead weight on my mind wa that horribl old spellingbook with
oval woodcut shape to my youth fanci like the glass out of
spectacl
when i got to the offic and shut out old tiffei and the rest of
them with my hand sat at my desk in my own particular nook think
of thi earthquak that had taken place so unexpectedli and in the
bitter of my spirit curs jip i fell into such a state of torment
about dora that i wonder i did not take up my hat and rush insan to
norwood the idea of their frighten her and make her cry and of
my not be there to comfort her wa so excruci that it impel
me to write a wild letter to mr spenlow beseech him not to visit
upon her the consequ of my aw destini i implor him to spare
her gentl naturenot to crush a fragil flowerand address him
gener to the best of my remembr as if instead of be her
father he had been an ogr or the dragon of wantlei thi letter i
seal and laid upon hi desk befor he return and when he came in
i saw him through the halfopen door of hi room take it up and read
it
he said noth about it all the morn but befor he went awai in the
afternoon he call me in and told me that i need not make myself at
all uneasi about hi daughter happi he had assur her he said
that it wa all nonsens and he had noth more to sai to her he
believ he wa an indulg father as inde he wa and i might
spare myself ani solicitud on her account
you mai make it necessari if you ar foolish or obstin mr
copperfield he observ for me to send my daughter abroad again
for a term but i have a better opinion of you i hope you will be wiser
than that in a few dai as to miss murdston for i had allud to
her in the letter i respect that ladi vigil and feel oblig to
her but she ha strict charg to avoid the subject all i desir mr
copperfield is that it should be forgotten all you have got to do
mr copperfield is to forget it
all in the note i wrote to miss mill i bitterli quot thi
sentiment all i had to do i said with gloomi sarcasm wa to forget
dora that wa all and what wa that i entreat miss mill to see
me that even if it could not be done with mr millss sanction
and concurr i besought a clandestin interview in the back kitchen
where the mangl wa i inform her that my reason wa totter on
it throne and onli she miss mill could prevent it be depos
i sign myself her distractedli and i couldnt help feel while
i read thi composit over befor send it by a porter that it wa
someth in the style of mr micawb
howev i sent it at night i repair to miss millss street and
walk up and down until i wa stealthili fetch in by miss millss
maid and taken the area wai to the back kitchen i have sinc seen
reason to believ that there wa noth on earth to prevent my go in
at the front door and be shown up into the drawingroom except miss
millss love of the romant and mysteri
in the back kitchen i rave as becam me i went there i suppos
to make a fool of myself and i am quit sure i did it miss mill had
receiv a hasti note from dora tell her that all wa discov
and sai oh prai come to me julia do do but miss mill
mistrust the accept of her presenc to the higher power had
not yet gone and we were all benight in the desert of sahara
miss mill had a wonder flow of word and like to pour them out i
could not help feel though she mingl her tear with mine that she
had a dread luxuri in our afflict she pet them as i mai sai
and made the most of them a deep gulf she observ had open between
dora and me and love could onli span it with it rainbow love must
suffer in thi stern world it ever had been so it ever would be so no
matter miss mill remark heart confin by cobweb would burst at
last and then love wa aveng
thi wa small consol but miss mill wouldnt encourag fallaci
hope she made me much more wretch than i wa befor and i felt and
told her with the deepest gratitud that she wa inde a friend we
resolv that she should go to dora the first thing in the morn
and find some mean of assur her either by look or word of my
devot and miseri we part overwhelm with grief and i think miss
mill enjoi herself complet
i confid all to my aunt when i got home and in spite of all she could
sai to me went to bed despair i got up despair and went out
despair it wa saturdai morn and i went straight to the common
i wa surpris when i came within sight of our officedoor to see the
ticketport stand outsid talk togeth and some halfdozen
straggler gaze at the window which were shut up i quicken my
pace and pass among them wonder at their look went hurriedli
in
the clerk were there but nobodi wa do anyth old tiffei for
the first time in hi life i should think wa sit on somebodi
els stool and had not hung up hi hat
thi is a dread calam mr copperfield said he as i enter
what is i exclaim what the matter
dont you know cri tiffei and all the rest of them come round
me
no said i look from face to face
mr spenlow said tiffei
what about him
dead i thought it wa the offic reel and not i as on of
the clerk caught hold of me thei sat me down in a chair unti my
neckcloth and brought me some water i have no idea whether thi took
ani time
dead said i
he dine in town yesterdai and drove down in the phaeton by himself
said tiffei have sent hi own groom home by the coach as he
sometim did you know
well
the phaeton went home without him the hors stop at the
stableg the man went out with a lantern nobodi in the carriag
had thei run awai
thei were not hot said tiffei put on hi glass no hotter i
understand than thei would have been go down at the usual pace the
rein were broken but thei had been drag on the ground the hous
wa rous up directli and three of them went out along the road thei
found him a mile off
more than a mile off mr tiffei interpos a junior
wa it i believ you ar right said tiffeymor than a mile
offnot far from the churchli partli on the roadsid and partli
on the path upon hi face whether he fell out in a fit or got out
feel ill befor the fit came onor even whether he wa quit dead
then though there is no doubt he wa quit insensibleno on appear
to know if he breath certainli he never spoke medic assist
wa got as soon as possibl but it wa quit useless
i cannot describ the state of mind into which i wa thrown by thi
intellig the shock of such an event happen so suddenli and
happen to on with whom i had been in ani respect at varianceth
appal vacanc in the room he had occupi so late where hi chair
and tabl seem to wait for him and hi handwrit of yesterdai wa
like a ghostth indefin imposs of separ him from the
place and feel when the door open as if he might come inth
lazi hush and rest there wa in the offic and the insati relish
with which our peopl talk about it and other peopl came in and
out all dai and gorg themselv with the subjectthi is easili
intellig to anyon what i cannot describ is how in the innermost
recess of my own heart i had a lurk jealousi even of death how
i felt as if it might would push me from my ground in dora thought
how i wa in a grudg wai i have no word for enviou of her grief
how it made me restless to think of her weep to other or be
consol by other how i had a grasp avarici wish to shut out
everybodi from her but myself and to be all in all to her at that
unseason time of all time
in the troubl of thi state of mindnot exclus my own i hope
but known to othersi went down to norwood that night and find from
on of the servant when i made my inquiri at the door that miss
mill wa there got my aunt to direct a letter to her which i wrote
i deplor the untim death of mr spenlow most sincer and shed
tear in do so i entreat her to tell dora if dora were in a
state to hear it that he had spoken to me with the utmost kind and
consider and had coupl noth but tender not a singl or
reproach word with her name i know i did thi selfishli to have my
name brought befor her but i tri to believ it wa an act of justic
to hi memori perhap i did believ it
my aunt receiv a few line next dai in repli address outsid to
her within to me dora wa overcom by grief and when her friend had
ask her should she send her love to me had onli cri as she wa
alwai cry oh dear papa oh poor papa but she had not said no
and that i made the most of
mr jorkin who had been at norwood sinc the occurr came to the
offic a few dai afterward he and tiffei were closet togeth for
some few moment and then tiffei look out at the door and beckon me
in
oh said mr jorkin mr tiffei and myself mr copperfield ar
about to examin the desk the drawer and other such repositori
of the deceas with the view of seal up hi privat paper and
search for a will there is no trace of ani elsewher it mai be as
well for you to assist us if you pleas
i had been in agoni to obtain some knowledg of the circumst
in which my dora would be placeda in whose guardianship and so
forthand thi wa someth toward it we began the search at onc
mr jorkin unlock the drawer and desk and we all take out the
paper the officepap we place on on side and the privat paper
which were not numer on the other we were veri grave and when we
came to a strai seal or pencilcas or ring or ani littl articl of
that kind which we associ person with him we spoke veri low
we had seal up sever packet and were still go on dustili and
quietli when mr jorkin said to us appli exactli the same word to
hi late partner as hi late partner had appli to him
mr spenlow wa veri difficult to move from the beaten track you know
what he wa i am dispos to think he had made no will
oh i know he had said i
thei both stop and look at me on the veri dai when i last saw
him said i he told me that he had and that hi affair were long
sinc settl
mr jorkin and old tiffei shook their head with on accord
that look unpromis said tiffei
veri unpromis said mr jorkin
sure you dont doubt i began
my good mr copperfield said tiffei lai hi hand upon my arm and
shut up both hi ey as he shook hi head if you had been in the
common as long as i have you would know that there is no subject on
which men ar so inconsist and so littl to be trust
why bless my soul he made that veri remark i repli persist
i should call that almost final observ tiffei my opinion isno
will
it appear a wonder thing to me but it turn out that there wa
no will he had never so much as thought of make on so far as hi
paper afford ani evid for there wa no kind of hint sketch or
memorandum of ani testamentari intent whatev what wa scarc
less astonish to me wa that hi affair were in a most disord
state it wa extrem difficult i heard to make out what he ow or
what he had paid or of what he di possess it wa consid like
that for year he could have had no clear opinion on these subject
himself by littl and littl it came out that in the competit on
all point of appear and gentil then run high in the common
he had spent more than hi profession incom which wa not a veri
larg on and had reduc hi privat mean if thei ever had been
great which wa exceedingli doubt to a veri low ebb inde there
wa a sale of the furnitur and leas at norwood and tiffei told me
littl think how interest i wa in the stori that pai all the
just debt of the deceas and deduct hi share of outstand bad
and doubt debt due to the firm he wouldnt give a thousand pound
for all the asset remain
thi wa at the expir of about six week i had suffer tortur
all the time and thought i realli must have laid violent hand upon
myself when miss mill still report to me that my brokenheart
littl dora would sai noth when i wa mention but oh poor papa

good odour among the tiptop proctor and were rapidli slide down
to but a doubt posit the busi had been indiffer under mr
jorkin befor mr spenlow time and although it had been quicken
by the infus of new blood and by the displai which mr spenlow made
still it wa not establish on a suffici strong basi to bear
without be shaken such a blow as the sudden loss of it activ
manag it fell off veri much mr jorkin notwithstand hi
reput in the firm wa an easygo incap sort of man whose
reput out of door wa not calcul to back it up i wa turn
over to him now and when i saw him take hi snuff and let the busi
go i regret my aunt thousand pound more than ever
but thi wa not the worst of it there were a number of hangerson and
outsid about the common who without be proctor themselv

of my friend heep but it mai prove the steppingston to more ambiti
domiciliari accommod
i ask him whether he had reason so far to be satisfi with hi
friend heep treatment of him he got up to ascertain if the door were
close shut befor he repli in a lower voic

embarrass is with the gener of peopl at a disadvantag
that disadvantag is not diminish when that pressur necessit the
draw of stipendiari emolu befor those emolu ar strictli

write the truth whatev contradict and inconsist there were
within me as there ar within so mani of us whatev might have been

voic and with that sweet composur which had long ago made the hous
that held her quit a sacr place to me she soon won me from thi
weak and led me on to tell all that had happen sinc our last
meet
and there is not anoth word to tell agn said i when i had made
an end of my confid now my relianc is on you
but it must not be on me trotwood return agn with a pleasant
smile it must be on someon els
on dora said i
assuredli
why i have not mention agn said i a littl embarrass that
dora is rather difficult toi would not for the world sai to reli
upon becaus she is the soul of puriti and truthbut rather difficult
toi hardli know how to express it realli agn she is a timid
littl thing and easili disturb and frighten some time ago befor
her father death when i thought it right to mention to herbut ill
tell you if you will bear with me how it wa
accordingli i told agn about my declar of poverti about the
cookerybook the housekeep account and all the rest of it
oh trotwood she remonstr with a smile just your old headlong
wai you might have been in earnest in strive to get on in the world
without be so veri sudden with a timid love inexperienc girl
poor dora
i never heard such sweet forbear kind express in a voic
as she express in make thi repli it wa as if i had seen her
admiringli and tenderli embrac dora and tacitli reprov me by
her consider protect for my hot hast in flutter that littl
heart it wa as if i had seen dora in all her fascin artless
caress agn and thank her and coaxingli appeal against me
and love me with all her childish innoc
i felt so grate to agn and admir her so i saw those two
togeth in a bright perspect such wellassoci friend each
adorn the other so much
what ought i to do then agn i inquir after look at the fire
a littl while what would it be right to do
i think said agn that the honour cours to take would be to
write to those two ladi dont you think that ani secret cours is an
unworthi on
ye if you think so said i
i am poorli qualifi to judg of such matter repli agn with
a modest hesit but i certainli feelin short i feel that your
be secret and clandestin is not be like yourself
like myself in the too high opinion you have of me agn i am
afraid said i
like yourself in the candour of your natur she return and
therefor i would write to those two ladi i would relat as plainli
and as openli as possibl all that ha taken place and i would ask
their permiss to visit sometim at their hous consid that
you ar young and strive for a place in life i think it would be
well to sai that you would readili abid by ani condit thei might
impos upon you i would entreat them not to dismiss your request
without a refer to dora and to discuss it with her when thei should
think the time suitabl i would not be too vehement said agn
gentli or propos too much i would trust to my fidel and
perseveranceand to dora
but if thei were to frighten dora again agn by speak to her
said i and if dora were to cry and sai noth about me
is that like inquir agn with the same sweet consider in
her face
god bless her she is as easili scare as a bird said i it might
be or if the two miss spenlow elderli ladi of that sort ar odd
charact sometim should not be like person to address in that
wai
i dont think trotwood return agn rais her soft ey
to mine i would consid that perhap it would be better onli to
consid whether it is right to do thi and if it is to do it
i had no longer ani doubt on the subject with a lighten heart though
with a profound sens of the weighti import of my task i devot
the whole afternoon to the composit of the draft of thi letter for
which great purpos agn relinquish her desk to me but first i went
downstair to see mr wickfield and uriah heep

as if he were which wa the same thinghad brought hi conduct to a
climax by take it into hi head that he would go to india why should

divid between my desir to appear to advantag and my apprehens
of put on anyth that might impair my sever practic charact
in the ey of the miss spenlow i endeavour to hit a happi medium
between these two extrem my aunt approv the result and mr dick
threw on of hi shoe after traddl and me for luck as we went
downstair
excel fellow as i knew traddl to be and warmli attach to him as
i wa i could not help wish on that delic occas that he had
never contract the habit of brush hi hair so veri upright it
gave him a surpris looknot to sai a hearthbroomi kind of
expressionwhich my apprehens whisper might be fatal to us
i took the liberti of mention it to traddl as we were walk to
putnei and sai that if he would smooth it down a littl
my dear copperfield said traddl lift off hi hat and rub
hi hair all kind of wai noth would give me greater pleasur but
it wont
wont be smooth down said i
no said traddl noth will induc it if i wa to carri a
halfhundredweight upon it all the wai to putnei it would be up again
the moment the weight wa taken off you have no idea what obstin
hair mine is copperfield i am quit a fret porcupin
i wa a littl disappoint i must confess but thoroughli charm by
hi goodnatur too i told him how i esteem hi goodnatur and said
that hi hair must have taken all the obstinaci out of hi charact
for he had none
oh return traddl laugh i assur you it quit an old
stori my unfortun hair my uncl wife couldnt bear it she said
it exasper her it stood veri much in my wai too when i first fell
in love with sophi veri much
did she object to it
she didnt rejoin traddl but her eldest sisterth on that
the beautyquit made game of it i understand in fact all the
sister laugh at it
agreeabl said i
ye return traddl with perfect innoc it a joke for us
thei pretend that sophi ha a lock of it in her desk and is oblig to
shut it in a clasp book to keep it down we laugh about it
by the by my dear traddl said i your experi mai suggest
someth to me when you becam engag to the young ladi whom you have
just mention did you make a regular propos to her famili wa there
anyth likewhat we ar go through todai for instanc i ad
nervous
why repli traddl on whose attent face a thought shade had
stolen it wa rather a pain transact copperfield in my case
you see sophi be of so much us in the famili none of them could
endur the thought of her ever be marri inde thei had quit
settl among themselv that she never wa to be marri and thei
call her the old maid accordingli when i mention it with the
greatest precaut to mr crewler
the mama said i
the mama said traddlesreverend horac crewlerwhen i mention it
with everi possibl precaut to mr crewler the effect upon her wa
such that she gave a scream and becam insens i couldnt approach
the subject again for month
you did at last said i
well the reverend horac did said traddl he is an excel man
most exemplari in everi wai and he point out to her that she ought
as a christian to reconcil herself to the sacrific especi as it
wa so uncertain and to bear no uncharit feel toward me as to
myself copperfield i give you my word i felt a perfect bird of prei
toward the famili
the sister took your part i hope traddl
why i cant sai thei did he return when we had compar
reconcil mr crewler to it we had to break it to sarah you
recollect my mention sarah as the on that ha someth the matter
with her spine
perfectli
she clench both her hand said traddl look at me in dismai
shut her ey turn leadcolour becam perfectli stiff and
took noth for two dai but toastandwat administ with a
teaspoon
what a veri unpleas girl traddl i remark
oh i beg your pardon copperfield said traddl she is a veri
charm girl but she ha a great deal of feel in fact thei all
have sophi told me afterward that the selfreproach she underw
while she wa in attend upon sarah no word could describ i know
it must have been sever by my own feel copperfield which were
like a crimin after sarah wa restor we still had to break it
to the other eight and it produc variou effect upon them of a most
pathet natur the two littl on whom sophi educ have onli
just left off detest me
at ani rate thei ar all reconcil to it now i hope said i
yey i should sai thei were on the whole resign to it said
traddl doubtfulli the fact is we avoid mention the subject
and my unsettl prospect and indiffer circumst ar a great
consol to them there will be a deplor scene whenev we
ar marri it will be much more like a funer than a wed and
theyll all hate me for take her awai
hi honest face as he look at me with a seriocom shake of hi
head impress me more in the remembr than it did in the realiti
for i wa by thi time in a state of such excess trepid
and wander of mind as to be quit unabl to fix my attent on
anyth on our approach the hous where the miss spenlow live
i wa at such a discount in respect of my person look and presenc of
mind that traddl propos a gentl stimul in the form of a glass
of al thi have been administ at a neighbour publichous he
conduct me with totter step to the miss spenlow door
i had a vagu sensat of be as it were on view when the maid
open it and of waver somehow across a hall with a weatherglass
in it into a quiet littl drawingroom on the groundfloor command
a neat garden also of sit down here on a sofa and see
traddless hair start up now hi hat wa remov like on of those
obtrus littl figur made of spring that fly out of fictiti
snuffbox when the lid is taken off also of hear an oldfashion
clock tick awai on the chimneypiec and try to make it keep time
to the jerk of my heartwhich it wouldnt also of look round
the room for ani sign of dora and see none also of think that
jip onc bark in the distanc and wa instantli choke by somebodi
ultim i found myself back traddl into the fireplac and
bow in great confus to two dry littl elderli ladi dress in
black and each look wonderfulli like a prepar in chip or tan of
the late mr spenlow
prai said on of the two littl ladi be seat
when i had done tumbl over traddl and had sat upon someth which
wa not a catmi first seat wasi so far recov my sight as to
perceiv that mr spenlow had evid been the youngest of the
famili that there wa a dispar of six or eight year between the
two sister and that the younger appear to be the manag of the
confer inasmuch as she had my letter in her handso familiar as
it look to me and yet so oddand wa refer to it through an
eyeglass thei were dress alik but thi sister wore her dress with
a more youth air than the other and perhap had a trifl more frill
or tucker or brooch or bracelet or some littl thing of that kind
which made her look more live thei were both upright in their
carriag formal precis compos and quiet the sister who had
not my letter had her arm cross on her breast and rest on each
other like an idol
mr copperfield i believ said the sister who had got my letter
address herself to traddl
thi wa a fright begin traddl had to indic that i wa mr
copperfield and i had to lai claim to myself and thei had to divest
themselv of a preconceiv opinion that traddl wa mr copperfield
and altogeth we were in a nice condit to improv it we all
distinctli heard jip give two short bark and receiv anoth choke
mr copperfield said the sister with the letter
i did somethingbow i supposeand wa all attent when the other
sister struck in
my sister lavinia said she be convers with matter of thi
natur will state what we consid most calcul to promot the
happi of both parti
i discov afterward that miss lavinia wa an author in affair
of the heart by reason of there have ancient exist a certain mr
pidger who plai short whist and wa suppos to have been enamour
of her my privat opinion is that thi wa entir a gratuit
assumpt and that pidger wa altogeth innoc of ani such
sentimentsto which he had never given ani sort of express that
i could ever hear of both miss lavinia and miss clarissa had a
superstit howev that he would have declar hi passion if he
had not been cut short in hi youth at about sixti by overdrink
hi constitut and overdo an attempt to set it right again by
swill bath water thei had a lurk suspicion even that he di of
secret love though i must sai there wa a pictur of him in the hous
with a damask nose which conceal did not appear to have ever prei
upon
we will not said miss lavinia enter on the past histori of thi
matter our poor brother franciss death ha cancel that
we had not said miss clarissa been in the habit of frequent
associ with our brother franci but there wa no decid divis
or disunion between us franci took hi road we took our we
consid it conduc to the happi of all parti that it should
be so and it wa so
each of the sister lean a littl forward to speak shook her head
after speak and becam upright again when silent miss clarissa
never move her arm she sometim plai tune upon them with her
fingersminuet and march i should thinkbut never move them
our niec posit or suppos posit is much chang by our
brother franciss death said miss lavinia and therefor we consid
our brother opinion as regard her posit as be chang too we
have no reason to doubt mr copperfield that you ar a young gentleman
possess of good qualiti and honour charact or that you have
an affectionor ar fulli persuad that you have an affectionfor our
niec
i repli as i usual did whenev i had a chanc that nobodi had
ever love anybodi els as i love dora traddl came to my assist
with a confirmatori murmur
miss lavinia wa go on to make some rejoind when miss clarissa
who appear to be incessantli beset by a desir to refer to her brother
franci struck in again
if dora mama she said when she marri our brother franci had
at onc said that there wa not room for the famili at the dinnert
it would have been better for the happi of all parti
sister clarissa said miss lavinia perhap we neednt mind that
now
sister lavinia said miss clarissa it belong to the subject with
your branch of the subject on which alon you ar compet to speak i
should not think of interf on thi branch of the subject i have a
voic and an opinion it would have been better for the happi of
all parti if dora mama when she marri our brother franci had
mention plainli what her intent were we should then have known
what we had to expect we should have said prai do not invit us
at ani time and all possibl of misunderstand would have been
avoid
when miss clarissa had shaken her head miss lavinia resum again
refer to my letter through her eyeglass thei both had littl
bright round twinkl ey by the wai which were like bird ey
thei were not unlik bird altogeth have a sharp brisk sudden
manner and a littl short spruce wai of adjust themselv like
canari
miss lavinia as i have said resum
you ask permiss of my sister clarissa and myself mr copperfield
to visit here as the accept suitor of our niec
if our brother franci said miss clarissa break out again if i
mai call anyth so calm a break out wish to surround himself
with an atmospher of doctor common and of doctor common onli
what right or desir had we to object none i am sure we have ever
been far from wish to obtrud ourselv on anyon but why not sai
so let our brother franci and hi wife have their societi let
my sister lavinia and myself have our societi we can find it for
ourselv i hope
as thi appear to be address to traddl and me both traddl and
i made some sort of repli traddl wa inaud i think i observ
myself that it wa highli credit to all concern i dont in the
least know what i meant
sister lavinia said miss clarissa have now reliev her mind you
can go on my dear
miss lavinia proceed
mr copperfield my sister clarissa and i have been veri care
inde in consid thi letter and we have not consid it without
final show it to our niec and discuss it with our niec we
have no doubt that you think you like her veri much
think maam i raptur began oh
but miss clarissa give me a look just like a sharp canari as
request that i would not interrupt the oracl i beg pardon
affect said miss lavinia glanc at her sister for
corrobor which she gave in the form of a littl nod to everi
claus matur affect homag devot doe not easili express
itself it voic is low it is modest and retir it li in ambush
wait and wait such is the matur fruit sometim a life glide awai
and find it still ripen in the shade
of cours i did not understand then that thi wa an allus to her
suppos experi of the stricken pidger but i saw from the graviti
with which miss clarissa nod her head that great weight wa attach
to these word
the lightfor i call them in comparison with such sentiment the
lightinclin of veri young peopl pursu miss lavinia ar
dust compar to rock it is ow to the difficulti of know
whether thei ar like to endur or have ani real foundat that
my sister clarissa and myself have been veri undecid how to act mr
copperfield and mr
traddl said my friend find himself look at
i beg pardon of the inner templ i believ said miss clarissa
again glanc at my letter
traddl said exactli so and becam pretti red in the face
now although i had not receiv ani express encourag as yet i
fanci that i saw in the two littl sister and particularli in miss
lavinia an intensifi enjoy of thi new and fruit subject of
domest interest a settl down to make the most of it a disposit
to pet it in which there wa a good bright rai of hope i thought
i perceiv that miss lavinia would have uncommon satisfact in
superintend two young lover like dora and me and that miss
clarissa would have hardli less satisfact in see her superintend
us and in chime in with her own particular depart of the subject
whenev that impuls wa strong upon her thi gave me courag to
protest most vehement that i love dora better than i could tell or
anyon believ that all my friend knew how i love her that my aunt
agn traddl everyon who knew me knew how i love her and how
earnest my love had made me for the truth of thi i appeal to
traddl and traddl fire up as if he were plung into a
parliamentari debat realli did come out nobli confirm me in good
round term and in a plain sensibl practic manner that evid
made a favour impress

of cours my aunt wa immedi made acquaint with the success

cours of it she wa happi to see me so happi and promis to call on
dora aunt without loss of time but she took such a long walk up and
down our room that night while i wa write to agn that i began to
think she meant to walk till morn
my letter to agn wa a fervent and grate on narrat all the
good effect that had result from my follow her advic she wrote
by return of post to me her letter wa hope earnest and cheer
she wa alwai cheer from that time
i had my hand more full than ever now my daili journei to highgat
consid putnei wa a long wai off and i natur want to go
there as often as i could the propos teadrink be quit
impractic i compound with miss lavinia for permiss to visit
everi saturdai afternoon without detriment to my privileg sundai
so the close of everi week wa a delici time for me and i got
through the rest of the week by look forward to it
i wa wonderfulli reliev to find that my aunt and dora aunt
rub on all thing consid much more smoothli than i could have
expect my aunt made her promis visit within a few dai of the
confer and within a few more dai dora aunt call upon her
in due state and form similar but more friendli exchang took place
afterward usual at interv of three or four week i know that my
aunt distress dora aunt veri much by utterli set at naught the
digniti of flyconvey and walk out to putnei at extraordinari
time as shortli after breakfast or just befor tea likewis by
wear her bonnet in ani manner that happen to be comfort to her
head without at all defer to the prejudic of civil on that
subject but dora aunt soon agre to regard my aunt as an eccentr
and somewhat masculin ladi with a strong understand and although
my aunt occasion ruffl the feather of dora aunt by express
heret opinion on variou point of ceremoni she love me too
well not to sacrific some of her littl peculiar to the gener
harmoni
the onli member of our small societi who posit refus to adapt
himself to circumst wa jip he never saw my aunt without
immedi displai everi tooth in hi head retir under a chair
and growl incessantli with now and then a dole howl as if she
realli were too much for hi feel all kind of treatment were tri
with him coax scold slap bring him to buckingham
street where he instantli dash at the two cat to the terror of all
behold but he never could prevail upon himself to bear my
aunt societi he would sometim think he had got the better of hi
object and be amiabl for a few minut and then would put up hi
snub nose and howl to that extent that there wa noth for it but
to blind him and put him in the platewarm at length dora regularli
muffl him in a towel and shut him up there whenev my aunt wa
report at the door
on thing troubl me much after we had fallen into thi quiet train
it wa that dora seem by on consent to be regard like a pretti toi
or playth my aunt with whom she gradual becam familiar alwai
call her littl blossom and the pleasur of miss lavinia life wa
to wait upon her curl her hair make ornament for her and treat her
like a pet child what miss lavinia did her sister did as a matter of
cours it wa veri odd to me but thei all seem to treat dora in her
degre much as dora treat jip in hi
i made up my mind to speak to dora about thi and on dai when we were
out walk for we were licens by miss lavinia after a while to
go out walk by ourselv i said to her that i wish she could get
them to behav toward her differ
becaus you know my darl i remonstr you ar not a child
there said dora now your go to be cross
cross my love
i am sure theyr veri kind to me said dora and i am veri happi
well but my dearest life said i you might be veri happi and yet
be treat ration
dora gave me a reproach lookth prettiest lookand then began to
sob sai if i didnt like her why had i ever want so much to be
engag to her and why didnt i go awai now if i couldnt bear her
what could i do but kiss awai her tear and tell her how i dote on
her after that
i am sure i am veri affection said dora you oughtnt to be cruel
to me doadi
cruel my preciou love as if i wouldor couldb cruel to you for
the world
then dont find fault with me said dora make a rosebud of her
mouth and ill be good
i wa charm by her present ask me of her own accord to give
her that cookerybook i had onc spoken of and to show her how to keep
account as i had onc promis i would i brought the volum with me on
my next visit i got it prettili bound first to make it look less dry
and more invit and as we stroll about the common i show her an
old housekeepingbook of my aunt and gave her a set of tablet and
a pretti littl pencilcas and box of lead to practis housekeep
with
but the cookerybook made dora head ach and the figur made her
cry thei wouldnt add up she said so she rub them out and drew
littl nosegai and like of me and jip all over the tablet
then i playfulli tri verbal instruct in domest matter as we
walk about on a saturdai afternoon sometim for exampl when we
pass a butcher shop i would sai
now suppos my pet that we were marri and you were go to bui a
shoulder of mutton for dinner would you know how to bui it
my pretti littl dora face would fall and she would make her mouth
into a bud again as if she would veri much prefer to shut mine with a
kiss
would you know how to bui it my darl i would repeat perhap if
i were veri inflex
dora would think a littl and then repli perhap with great triumph
why the butcher would know how to sell it and what need i know oh
you silli boi
so when i onc ask dora with an ey to the cookerybook what she
would do if we were marri and i were to sai i should like a nice
irish stew she repli that she would tell the servant to make it and
then clap her littl hand togeth across my arm and laugh in
such a charm manner that she wa more delight than ever
consequ the princip us to which the cookerybook wa devot
wa be put down in the corner for jip to stand upon but dora wa so
pleas when she had train him to stand upon it without offer to
come off and at the same time to hold the pencilcas in hi mouth
that i wa veri glad i had bought it
and we fell back on the guitarcas and the flowerpaint and the
song about never leav off danc ta ra la and were as happi as
the week wa long i occasion wish i could ventur to hint to miss
lavinia that she treat the darl of my heart a littl too much like
a playth and i sometim awok as it were wonder to find that
i had fallen into the gener fault and treat her like a playth
toobut not often

i feel as if it were not for me to record even though thi manuscript
is intend for no ey but mine how hard i work at that tremend
shorthand and all improv appertain to it in my sens of
respons to dora and her aunt i will onli add to what i have
alreadi written of my persever at thi time of my life and of a
patient and continu energi which then began to be matur within me
and which i know to be the strong part of my charact if it have ani
strength at all that there on look back i find the sourc of my
success i have been veri fortun in worldli matter mani men have
work much harder and not succeed half so well but i never could
have done what i have done without the habit of punctual order
and dilig without the determin to concentr myself on on
object at a time no matter how quickli it successor should come upon
it heel which i then form heaven know i write thi in no spirit
of selflaud the man who review hi own life as i do mine
in go on here from page to page had need to have been a good man
inde if he would be spare the sharp conscious of mani talent
neglect mani opportun wast mani errat and pervert
feel constantli at war within hi breast and defeat him i
do not hold on natur gift i dare sai that i have not abus my
mean simpli is that whatev i have tri to do in life i have
tri with all my heart to do well that whatev i have devot myself
to i have devot myself to complet that in great aim and in
small i have alwai been thoroughli in earnest i have never believ
it possibl that ani natur or improv abil can claim immun from
the companionship of the steadi plain hardwork qualiti and
hope to gain it end there is no such thing as such fulfil on thi
earth some happi talent and some fortun opportun mai form the
two side of the ladder on which some men mount but the round of that
ladder must be made of stuff to stand wear and tear and there is no
substitut for thoroughgo ardent and sincer earnest never

the doctor in the perfect good of hi natur put out hi hand mr
wickfield held it for a littl while in hi with hi head bow down
i am sure said uriah writh himself into the silenc like a
congereel that thi is a subject full of unpleas to everybodi
but sinc we have got so far i ought to take the liberti of mention
that copperfield ha notic it too
i turn upon him and ask him how he dare refer to me
oh it veri kind of you copperfield return uriah undul all
over and we all know what an amiabl charact your is but you know
that the moment i spoke to you the other night you knew what i meant
you know you knew what i meant copperfield dont deni it you deni it
with the best intent but dont do it copperfield
i saw the mild ey of the good old doctor turn upon me for a moment
and i felt that the confess of my old misgiv and remembr
wa too plainli written in my face to be overlook it wa of no us
rage i could not undo that sai what i would i could not unsai it
we were silent again and remain so until the doctor rose and walk
twice or thrice across the room present he return to where hi
chair stood and lean on the back of it and occasion put
hi handkerchief to hi ey with a simpl honesti that did him more
honour to my think than ani disguis he could have effect said
i have been much to blame i believ i have been veri much to blame
i have expos on whom i hold in my heart to trial and aspersionsi
call them aspers even to have been conceiv in anybodi inmost
mindof which she never but for me could have been the object
uriah heep gave a kind of snivel i think to express sympathi
of which my anni said the doctor never but for me could have
been the object gentlemen i am old now as you know i do not feel
tonight that i have much to live for but my lifemi lifeupon the
truth and honour of the dear ladi who ha been the subject of thi
convers
i do not think that the best embodi of chivalri the realiz of
the handsomest and most romant figur ever imagin by painter could
have said thi with a more impress and affect digniti than the
plain old doctor did
but i am not prepar he went on to denyperhap i mai have been
without know it in some degre prepar to admitthat i mai have
unwittingli ensnar that ladi into an unhappi marriag i am a man
quit unaccustom to observ and i cannot but believ that the
observ of sever peopl of differ ag and posit all too
plainli tend in on direct and that so natur is better than
mine
i had often admir as i have elsewher describ hi benign manner
toward hi youth wife but the respect tender he manifest
in everi refer to her on thi occas and the almost reverenti
manner in which he put awai from him the lightest doubt of her
integr exalt him in my ey beyond descript
i marri that ladi said the doctor when she wa extrem young i
took her to myself when her charact wa scarc form so far as it
wa develop it had been my happi to form it i knew her father
well i knew her well i had taught her what i could for the love of
all her beauti and virtuou qualiti if i did her wrong as i fear
i did in take advantag but i never meant it of her gratitud and
her affect i ask pardon of that ladi in my heart
he walk across the room and came back to the same place hold
the chair with a grasp that trembl like hi subdu voic in it
earnest
i regard myself as a refug for her from the danger and
vicissitud of life i persuad myself that unequ though we were in
year she would live tranquilli and contentedli with me i did not shut
out of my consider the time when i should leav her free and still
young and still beauti but with her judgement more maturedno
gentlemenupon my truth
hi home figur seem to be lighten up by hi fidel and
generos everi word he utter had a forc that no other grace could
have impart to it
my life with thi ladi ha been veri happi until tonight i have
had uninterrupt occas to bless the dai on which i did her great
injustic
hi voic more and more falter in the utter of these word
stop for a few moment then he went on
onc awaken from my dreami have been a poor dreamer in on wai or
other all my lifei see how natur it is that she should have some
regret feel toward her old companion and her equal that she doe
regard him with some innoc regret with some blameless thought of
what might have been but for me is i fear too true much that i have
seen but not note ha come back upon me with new mean dure
thi last try hour but beyond thi gentlemen the dear ladi name
never must be coupl with a word a breath of doubt
for a littl while hi ey kindl and hi voic wa firm for a littl
while he wa again silent present he proceed as befor
it onli remain for me to bear the knowledg of the unhappi i have
occas as submiss as i can it is she who should reproach not
i to save her from misconstruct cruel misconstruct that even my
friend have not been abl to avoid becom my duti the more retir
we live the better i shall discharg it and when the time comesmai
it come soon if it be hi merci pleasurewhen my death shall
releas her from constraint i shall close my ey upon her honour
face with unbound confid and love and leav her with no sorrow
then to happier and brighter dai
i could not see him for the tear which hi earnest and good
so adorn by and so adorn the perfect simplic of hi manner
brought into my ey he had move to the door when he ad
gentlemen i have shown you my heart i am sure you will respect it
what we have said tonight is never to be said more wickfield give me
an old friend arm upstair
mr wickfield hasten to him without interchang a word thei went
slowli out of the room togeth uriah look after them
well master copperfield said uriah meekli turn to me the thing
hasnt took quit the turn that might have been expect for the old
scholarwhat an excel mani as blind as a brickbat but thi
famili out of the cart i think
i need but the sound of hi voic to be so madli enrag as i never
wa befor and never have been sinc
you villain said i what do you mean by entrap me into your
scheme how dare you appeal to me just now you fals rascal as if we
had been in discuss togeth
as we stood front to front i saw so plainli in the stealthi
exult of hi face what i alreadi so plainli knew i mean that he
forc hi confid upon me expressli to make me miser and had
set a deliber trap for me in thi veri matter that i couldnt bear
it the whole of hi lank cheek wa invitingli befor me and i struck
it with my open hand with that forc that my finger tingl as if i had
burnt them
he caught the hand in hi and we stood in that connexion look at
each other we stood so a long time long enough for me to see the
white mark of my finger die out of the deep red of hi cheek and
leav it a deeper red
copperfield he said at length in a breathless voic have you taken
leav of your sens
i have taken leav of you said i wrest my hand awai you dog
ill know no more of you
wont you said he constrain by the pain of hi cheek to put hi
hand there perhap you wont be abl to help it isnt thi ungrat
of you now
i have shown you often enough said i that i despis you i have
shown you now more plainli that i do why should i dread your do
your worst to all about you what els do you ever do
he perfectli understood thi allus to the consider that had
hitherto restrain me in my commun with him i rather think
that neither the blow nor the allus would have escap me but for
the assur i had had from agn that night it is no matter
there wa anoth long paus hi ey as he look at me seem to
take everi shade of colour that could make ey ugli
copperfield he said remov hi hand from hi cheek you have
alwai gone against me i know you alwai us to be against me at mr
wickfield
you mai think what you like said i still in a tower rage if it
is not true so much the worthier you
and yet i alwai like you copperfield he rejoin
i deign to make him no repli and take up my hat wa go out to
bed when he came between me and the door
copperfield he said there must be two parti to a quarrel i wont
be on
you mai go to the devil said i
dont sai that he repli i know youll be sorri afterward how
can you make yourself so inferior to me as to show such a bad spirit
but i forgiv you

go and attack me that have alwai been a friend to you but there
cant be a quarrel without two parti and i wont be on i will be
a friend to you in spite of you so now you know what youv got to
expect
the necess of carri on thi dialogu hi part in which wa
veri slow mine veri quick in a low tone that the hous might not be
disturb at an unseason hour did not improv my temper though my
passion wa cool down mere tell him that i should expect from
him what i alwai had expect and had never yet been disappoint in
i open the door upon him as if he had been a great walnut put there
to be crack and went out of the hous but he slept out of the hous
too at hi mother lodg and befor i had gone mani hundr yard
came up with me
you know copperfield he said in my ear i did not turn my head
your in quit a wrong posit which i felt to be true and that
made me chafe the more you cant make thi a brave thing and you
cant help be forgiven i dont intend to mention it to mother nor
to ani live soul im determin to forgiv you but i do wonder
that you should lift your hand against a person that you knew to be so
umbl
i felt onli less mean than he he knew me better than i knew myself if
he had retort or openli exasper me it would have been a relief
and a justif but he had put me on a slow fire on which i lai
torment half the night
in the morn when i came out the earli churchbel wa ring
and he wa walk up and down with hi mother he address me as if
noth had happen and i could do no less than repli i had struck
him hard enough to give him the toothach i suppos at all event
hi face wa ti up in a black silk handkerchief which with hi hat
perch on the top of it wa far from improv hi appear i heard
that he went to a dentist in london on the mondai morn and had a
tooth out i hope it wa a doubl on
the doctor gave out that he wa not quit well and remain alon for
a consider part of everi dai dure the remaind of the visit
agn and her father had been gone a week befor we resum our usual
work on the dai preced it resumpt the doctor gave me with hi
own hand a fold note not seal it wa address to myself and laid
an injunct on me in a few affection word never to refer to the
subject of that even i had confid it to my aunt but to no
on els it wa not a subject i could discuss with agn and agn
certainli had not the least suspicion of what had pass
neither i felt convinc had mr strong then sever week elaps
befor i saw the least chang in her it came on slowli like a cloud
when there is no wind at first she seem to wonder at the gentl
compass with which the doctor spoke to her and at hi wish that she
should have her mother with her to reliev the dull monotoni of her
life often when we were at work and she wa sit by i would see
her paus and look at him with that memor face afterward i
sometim observ her rise with her ey full of tear and go out
of the room gradual an unhappi shadow fell upon her beauti and
deepen everi dai mr markleham wa a regular inmat of the cottag
then but she talk and talk and saw noth
as thi chang stole on anni onc like sunshin in the doctor hous
the doctor becam older in appear and more grave but the sweet
of hi temper the placid kind of hi manner and hi benevol
solicitud for her if thei were capabl of ani increas were
increas i saw him onc earli on the morn of her birthdai when
she came to sit in the window while we were at work which she had
alwai done but now began to do with a timid and uncertain air that i
thought veri touch take her forehead between hi hand kiss it
and go hurriedli awai too much move to remain i saw her stand where
he had left her like a statu and then bend down her head and clasp
her hand and weep i cannot sai how sorrowfulli
sometim after that i fanci that she tri to speak even to me
in interv when we were left alon but she never utter a word the
doctor alwai had some new project for her particip in amus
awai from home with her mother and mr markleham who wa veri fond
of amus and veri easili dissatisfi with anyth els enter
into them with great goodwil and wa loud in her commend but
anni in a spiritless unhappi wai onli went whither she wa led and
seem to have no care for anyth
i did not know what to think neither did my aunt who must have walk
at variou time a hundr mile in her uncertainti what wa strangest
of all wa that the onli real relief which seem to make it wai into
the secret region of thi domest unhappi made it wai there in
the person of mr dick
what hi thought were on the subject or what hi observ wa i am
as unabl to explain as i dare sai he would have been to assist me in
the task but as i have record in the narr of my school dai
hi vener for the doctor wa unbound and there is a subtleti of
percept in real attach even when it is born toward man by on
of the lower anim which leav the highest intellect behind to thi
mind of the heart if i mai call it so in mr dick some bright rai of
the truth shot straight
he had proudli resum hi privileg in mani of hi spare hour
of walk up and down the garden with the doctor as he had been
accustom to pace up and down the doctor walk at canterburi but
matter were no sooner in thi state than he devot all hi spare time
and got up earlier to make it more to these perambul if he had
never been so happi as when the doctor read that marvel perform
the dictionari to him he wa now quit miser unless the doctor
pull it out of hi pocket and began when the doctor and i were
engag he now fell into the custom of walk up and down with mr
strong and help her to trim her favourit flower or weed the
bed i dare sai he rare spoke a dozen word in an hour but hi quiet
interest and hi wist face found immedi respons in both their
breast each knew that the other like him and that he love both and
he becam what no on els could bea link between them
when i think of him with hi impenetr wise face walk up and
down with the doctor delight to be batter by the hard word in the
dictionari when i think of him carri huge wateringpot after anni
kneel down in veri paw of glove at patient microscop work among
the littl leav express as no philosoph could have express
in everyth he did a delic desir to be her friend shower
sympathi trust and affect out of everi hole in the
wateringpot when i think of him never wander in that better mind
of hi to which unhappi address itself never bring the
unfortun king charl into the garden never waver in hi grate
servic never divert from hi knowledg that there wa someth
wrong or from hi wish to set it righti realli feel almost asham
of have known that he wa not quit in hi wit take account of the
utmost i have done with mine
nobodi but myself trot know what that man is my aunt would proudli
remark when we convers about it dick will distinguish himself yet
i must refer to on other topic befor i close thi chapter while the
visit at the doctor wa still in progress i observ that the postman
brought two or three letter everi morn for uriah heep who remain
at highgat until the rest went back it be a leisur time and that
these were alwai direct in a businesslik manner by mr micawb
who now assum a round legal hand i wa glad to infer from these
slight premis that mr micawb wa do well and consequ wa
much surpris to receiv about thi time the follow letter from
hi amiabl wife

i should assur you that beyond know that it is pass from morn
to night at the offic i now know less of it than i do of the man in
the south connect with whose mouth the thoughtless children repeat
an idl tale respect cold plum porridg i should adopt a popular
fallaci to express an actual fact
but thi is not all mr micawb is moros he is sever he is
estrang from our eldest son and daughter he ha no pride in hi

littl peg the guitarcas quit at home on it heel in a corner
and everybodi tumbl over jip pagoda which is much too big for the

becaus i am so pleas and i believ it less than ever
do you think it pretti doadi sai dora
pretti i should rather think i did
and ar you sure you like me veri much sai dora
the topic is fraught with such danger to the bonnet that miss lavinia
give anoth littl scream and beg me to understand that dora is onli
to be look at and on no account to be touch so dora stand in a
delight state of confus for a minut or two to be admir and
then take off her bonnetlook so natur without itand run awai
with it in her hand and come danc down again in her own familiar
dress and ask jip if i have got a beauti littl wife and whether
hell forgiv her for be marri and kneel down to make him stand
upon the cookerybook for the last time in her singl life
i go home more incredul than ever to a lodg that i have hard by
and get up veri earli in the morn to ride to the highgat road and
fetch my aunt
i have never seen my aunt in such state she is dress in
lavendercolour silk and ha a white bonnet on and is amaz janet
ha dress her and is there to look at me peggotti is readi to go to
church intend to behold the ceremoni from the galleri mr dick
who is to give my darl to me at the altar ha had hi hair curl
traddl whom i have taken up by appoint at the turnpik present
a dazzl combin of cream colour and light blue and both he and
mr dick have a gener effect about them of be all glove
no doubt i see thi becaus i know it is so but i am astrai and seem
to see noth nor do i believ anyth whatev still as we drive
along in an open carriag thi fairi marriag is real enough to fill
me with a sort of wonder piti for the unfortun peopl who have
no part in it but ar sweep out the shop and go to their daili
occup
my aunt sit with my hand in her all the wai when we stop a littl wai
short of the church to put down peggotti whom we have brought on the
box she give it a squeez and me a kiss

tut child sai my aunt and give her hand in overflow cordial
to traddl who then give hi to mr dick who then give hi to me
who then give mine to traddl and then we come to the church door
the church is calm enough i am sure but it might be a steampow loom
in full action for ani sed effect it ha on me i am too far gone
for that
the rest is all a more or less incoher dream
a dream of their come in with dora of the pewopen arrang us
like a drillserg befor the altar rail of my wonder even
then why pewopen must alwai be the most disagre femal
procur and whether there is ani religi dread of a disastr
infect of goodhumour which render it indispens to set those
vessel of vinegar upon the road to heaven
of the clergyman and clerk appear of a few boatmen and some
other peopl stroll in of an ancient marin behind me strongli
flavour the church with rum of the servic begin in a deep

chapter 44 our housekeep
it wa a strang condit of thing the honeymoon be over and the
bridesmaid gone home when i found myself sit down in my own
small hous with dora quit thrown out of employ as i mai sai in
respect of the delici old occup of make love
it seem such an extraordinari thing to have dora alwai there it wa
so unaccount not to be oblig to go out to see her not to have ani
occas to be torment myself about her not to have to write to her
not to be scheme and devis opportun of be alon with her
sometim of an even when i look up from my write and saw her
seat opposit i would lean back in my chair and think how queer it
wa that there we were alon togeth as a matter of coursenobodi
busi ani moreal the romanc of our engag put awai upon a
shelf to rustno on to pleas but on anotheron anoth to pleas
for life
when there wa a debat and i wa kept out veri late it seem so
strang to me as i wa walk home to think that dora wa at home it
wa such a wonder thing at first to have her come softli down to
talk to me as i at my supper it wa such a stupend thing to know
for certain that she put her hair in paper it wa altogeth such an
astonish event to see her do it
i doubt whether two young bird could have known less about keep
hous than i and my pretti dora did we had a servant of cours she
kept hous for us i have still a latent belief that she must have been
mr crupp daughter in disguis we had such an aw time of it with
mari ann
her name wa paragon her natur wa repres to us when we engag
her as be feebli express in her name she had a written charact
as larg as a proclam and accord to thi document could do
everyth of a domest natur that ever i heard of and a great mani
thing that i never did hear of she wa a woman in the prime of life
of a sever counten and subject particularli in the arm to
a sort of perpetu measl or fieri rash she had a cousin in the
lifeguard with such long leg that he look like the afternoon
shadow of somebodi els hi shelljacket wa as much too littl for him
as he wa too big for the premis he made the cottag smaller than it
need have been by be so veri much out of proport to it besid
which the wall were not thick and whenev he pass the even at
our hous we alwai knew of it by hear on continu growl in the
kitchen

believ that she wa in a fit when we found her under the boiler and
that the defici teaspoon were attribut to the dustman

full extent of her gener feel toward my dear wife
these ar earli dai trot she pursu and rome wa not built in a

the garden path for there wa a commun between our cottag in
that direct give betsei trotwood love to blossom when you come
back and whatev you do trot never dream of set betsei up as a
scarecrow for if i ever saw her in the glass she quit grim enough
and gaunt enough in her privat capac
with thi my aunt ti her head up in a handkerchief with which she wa
accustom to make a bundl of it on such occas and i escort her
home as she stood in her garden hold up her littl lantern to light
me back i thought her observ of me had an anxiou air again but
i wa too much occupi in ponder on what she had said and too much
impressedfor the first time in realitybi the convict that dora
and i had inde to work out our futur for ourselv and that no on
could assist us to take much notic of it
dora came steal down in her littl slipper to meet me now that i
wa alon and cri upon my shoulder and said i had been hardheart
and she had been naughti and i said much the same thing in effect i
believ and we made it up and agre that our first littl differ
wa to be our last and that we were never to have anoth if we live a
hundr year
the next domest trial we went through wa the ordeal of servant
mari ann cousin desert into our coalhol and wa brought out to
our great amaz by a piquet of hi companion in arm who took
him awai handcuf in a process that cover our frontgarden with
ignomini thi nerv me to get rid of mari ann who went so mildli
on receipt of wage that i wa surpris until i found out about the
teaspoon and also about the littl sum she had borrow in my
name of the tradespeopl without author after an interv of mr
kidgerburyth oldest inhabit of kentish town i believ who went
out chare but wa too feebl to execut her concept of that
artw found anoth treasur who wa on of the most amiabl of
women but who gener made a point of fall either up or down the
kitchen stair with the trai and almost plung into the parlour
as into a bath with the teath the ravag commit by thi
unfortun render her dismiss necessari she wa succeed with
interv of mr kidgerburi by a long line of incap termin
in a young person of genteel appear who went to greenwich fair in
dora bonnet after whom i rememb noth but an averag equal of
failur
everybodi we had anyth to do with seem to cheat us our appear
in a shop wa a signal for the damag good to be brought out
immedi if we bought a lobster it wa full of water all our meat
turn out to be tough and there wa hardli ani crust to our loav
in search of the principl on which joint ought to be roast to be
roast enough and not too much i myself refer to the cookeri book
and found it there establish as the allow of a quarter of an hour
to everi pound and sai a quarter over but the principl alwai fail
us by some curiou fatal and we never could hit ani medium between
red and cinder
i had reason to believ that in accomplish these failur we incur
a far greater expens than if we had achiev a seri of triumph it
appear to me on look over the tradesmen book as if we might
have kept the basement storei pave with butter such wa the extens
scale of our consumpt of that articl i dont know whether the
excis return of the period mai have exhibit ani increas in the
demand for pepper but if our perform did not affect the market
i should sai sever famili must have left off us it and the most
wonder fact of all wa that we never had anyth in the hous
as to the washerwoman pawn the cloth and come in a state of
penit intox to apolog i suppos that might have happen
sever time to anybodi also the chimnei on fire the parish engin
and perjuri on the part of the beadl but i apprehend that we were
person fortun in engag a servant with a tast for cordial
who swell our run account for porter at the publichous by such
inexplic item as quartern rum shrub mr c halfquartern
gin and clove mr c glass rum and peppermint mr cthe
parenthes alwai refer to dora who wa suppos it appear on
explan to have imbib the whole of these refresh
on of our first feat in the housekeep wai wa a littl dinner to
traddl i met him in town and ask him to walk out with me that
afternoon he readili consent i wrote to dora sai i would bring
him home it wa pleasant weather and on the road we made my domest
happi the theme of convers traddl wa veri full of it and
said that pictur himself with such a home and sophi wait and
prepar for him he could think of noth want to complet hi
bliss
i could not have wish for a prettier littl wife at the opposit end
of the tabl but i certainli could have wish when we sat down for a
littl more room i did not know how it wa but though there were onli
two of us we were at onc alwai cramp for room and yet had alwai
room enough to lose everyth in i suspect it mai have been becaus
noth had a place of it own except jip pagoda which invari
block up the main thoroughfar on the present occas traddl
wa so hem in by the pagoda and the guitarcas and dora
flowerpaint and my writingt that i had seriou doubt of the
possibl of hi us hi knife and fork but he protest with hi
own goodhumour ocean of room copperfield i assur you ocean
there wa anoth thing i could have wish name that jip had never
been encourag to walk about the tablecloth dure dinner i began to
think there wa someth disorderli in hi be there at all even
if he had not been in the habit of put hi foot in the salt or the
melt butter on thi occas he seem to think he wa introduc
expressli to keep traddl at bai and he bark at my old friend and
made short run at hi plate with such undaunt pertinac that he
mai be said to have engross the convers
howev as i knew how tenderheart my dear dora wa and how
sensit she would be to ani slight upon her favourit i hint no
object for similar reason i made no allus to the skirmish
plate upon the floor or to the disreput appear of the castor
which were all at six and seven and look drunk or to the further
blockad of traddl by wander veget dish and jug i could
not help wonder in my own mind as i contempl the boil leg of
mutton befor me previou to carv it how it came to pass that
our joint of meat were of such extraordinari shapesand whether our
butcher contract for all the deform sheep that came into the world
but i kept my reflect to myself
my love said i to dora what have you got in that dish
i could not imagin why dora had been make tempt littl face at
me as if she want to kiss me
oyster dear said dora timidli
wa that your thought said i delight
yey doadi said dora
there never wa a happier on i exclaim lai down the
carvingknif and fork there is noth traddl like so much
yey doadi said dora and so i bought a beauti littl barrel
of them and the man said thei were veri good but ii am afraid
there someth the matter with them thei dont seem right here
dora shook her head and diamond twinkl in her ey
thei ar onli open in both shell said i take the top on off my
love
but it wont come off said dora try veri hard and look veri
much distress
do you know copperfield said traddl cheerfulli examin the
dish i think it is in consequencethei ar capit oyster but i
think it is in consequenceof their never have been open
thei never had been open and we had no oysterknivesand couldnt
have us them if we had so we look at the oyster and at the
mutton at least we at as much of it as wa done and made up with
caper if i had permit him i am satisfi that traddl would have
made a perfect savag of himself and eaten a plate of raw meat to
express enjoy of the repast but i would hear of no such immol
on the altar of friendship and we had a cours of bacon instead there
happen by good fortun to be cold bacon in the larder
my poor littl wife wa in such afflict when she thought i should be
annoi and in such a state of joi when she found i wa not that the
discomfitur i had subdu veri soon vanish and we pass a happi
even dora sit with her arm on my chair while traddl and i
discuss a glass of wine and take everi opportun of whisper
in my ear that it wa so good of me not to be a cruel cross old boi by
and by she made tea for us which it wa so pretti to see her do as if
she wa busi herself with a set of doll teath that i wa not
particular about the qualiti of the beverag then traddl and i plai
a game or two at cribbag and dora sing to the guitar the while
it seem to me as if our courtship and marriag were a tender dream
of mine and the night when i first listen to her voic were not yet
over
when traddl went awai and i came back into the parlour from see
him out my wife plant her chair close to mine and sat down by my
side i am veri sorri she said will you try to teach me doadi
i must teach myself first dora said i i am as bad as you love
ah but you can learn she return and you ar a clever clever
man
nonsens mous said i
i wish resum my wife after a long silenc that i could have gone
down into the countri for a whole year and live with agn
her hand were clasp upon my shoulder and her chin rest on them
and her blue ey look quietli into mine
why so i ask
i think she might have improv me and i think i might have learn
from her said dora
all in good time my love agn ha had her father to take care of for
these mani year you should rememb even when she wa quit a child
she wa the agn whom we know said i
will you call me a name i want you to call me inquir dora without
move
what is it i ask with a smile
it a stupid name she said shake her curl for a moment
childwif
i laughingli ask my childwif what her fanci wa in desir to be so
call she answer without move otherwis than as the arm i twine
about her mai have brought her blue ey nearer to me
i dont mean you silli fellow that you should us the name instead
of dora i onli mean that you should think of me that wai when you ar
go to be angri with me sai to yourself it onli my childwif
when i am veri disappoint sai i knew a long time ago that she
would make but a childwif when you miss what i should like to be
and i think can never be sai still my foolish childwif love me
for inde i do
i had not been seriou with her have no idea until now that she wa
seriou herself but her affection natur wa so happi in what i now
said to her with my whole heart that her face becam a laugh on
befor her glitter ey were dry she wa soon my childwif inde
sit down on the floor outsid the chines hous ring all
the littl bell on after anoth to punish jip for hi recent bad
behaviour while jip lai blink in the doorwai with hi head out even
too lazi to be teas
thi appeal of dora made a strong impress on me i look back on the
time i write of i invok the innoc figur that i dearli love to
come out from the mist and shadow of the past and turn it gentl
head toward me onc again and i can still declar that thi on littl
speech wa constantli in my memori i mai not have us it to the best
account i wa young and inexperienc but i never turn a deaf ear to
it artless plead
dora told me shortli afterward that she wa go to be a wonder
housekeep accordingli she polish the tablet point the pencil
bought an immens accountbook carefulli stitch up with a needl and
thread all the leav of the cookeri book which jip had torn and made
quit a desper littl attempt to be good as she call it but the
figur had the old obstin propensitythei would not add up when
she had enter two or three labori item in the accountbook jip
would walk over the page wag hi tail and smear them all out her
own littl righthand middl finger got steep to the veri bone in ink
and i think that wa the onli decid result obtain
sometim of an even when i wa at home and at workfor i wrote
a good deal now and wa begin in a small wai to be known as a
writeri would lai down my pen and watch my childwif try to be
good first of all she would bring out the immens accountbook and
lai it down upon the tabl with a deep sigh then she would open it at
the place where jip had made it illeg last night and call jip
up to look at hi misde thi would occas a divers in jip
favour and some ink of hi nose perhap as a penalti then she
would tell jip to lie down on the tabl instantli like a lionwhich
wa on of hi trick though i cannot sai the like wa
strikingand if he were in an obedi humour he would obei then she
would take up a pen and begin to write and find a hair in it then
she would take up anoth pen and begin to write and find that it
splutter then she would take up anoth pen and begin to write and
sai in a low voic oh it a talk pen and will disturb doadi
and then she would give it up as a bad job and put the accountbook
awai after pretend to crush the lion with it
or if she were in a veri sedat and seriou state of mind she would
sit down with the tablet and a littl basket of bill and other
document which look more like curlpap than anyth els and
endeavour to get some result out of them after sever compar on
with anoth and make entri on the tablet and blot them
out and count all the finger of her left hand over and over again
backward and forward she would be so vex and discourag and
would look so unhappi that it gave me pain to see her bright face
cloudedand for meand i would go softli to her and sai
what the matter dora
dora would look up hopelessli and repli thei wont come right thei
make my head ach so and thei wont do anyth i want
then i would sai now let us try togeth let me show you dora
then i would commenc a practic demonstr to which dora would pai
profound attent perhap for five minut when she would begin to be
dreadfulli tire and would lighten the subject by curl my hair
or try the effect of my face with my shirtcollar turn down if
i tacitli check thi play and persist she would look so
scare and disconsol as she becam more and more bewild that
the remembr of her natur gaieti when i first strai into her
path and of her be my childwif would come reproachfulli upon me
and i would lai the pencil down and call for the guitar
i had a great deal of work to do and had mani anxieti but the same
consider made me keep them to myself i am far from sure now
that it wa right to do thi but i did it for my childwif sake i
search my breast and i commit it secret if i know them without ani
reserv to thi paper the old unhappi loss or want of someth
had i am consciou some place in my heart but not to the embitter
of my life when i walk alon in the fine weather and thought of the
summer dai when all the air had been fill with my boyish enchant
i did miss someth of the realiz of my dream but i thought it
wa a soften glori of the past which noth could have thrown upon
the present time i did feel sometim for a littl while that i
could have wish my wife had been my counsellor had had more charact
and purpos to sustain me and improv me by had been endow with
power to fill up the void which somewher seem to be about me but
i felt as if thi were an unearthli consumm of my happi that
never had been meant to be and never could have been
i wa a boyish husband as to year i had known the soften influenc
of no other sorrow or experi than those record in these leav
if i did ani wrong as i mai have done much i did it in mistaken love
and in my want of wisdom i write the exact truth it would avail me
noth to extenu it now
thu it wa that i took upon myself the toil and care of our life
and had no partner in them we live much as befor in refer to our
scrambl household arrang but i had got us to those and dora
i wa pleas to see wa seldom vex now she wa bright and cheer
in the old childish wai love me dearli and wa happi with her old

the last respect thei were not often otherwiseand i went home late
dora would never rest when she heard my footstep but would alwai come
downstair to meet me when my even were unoccupi by the pursuit
for which i had qualifi myself with so much pain and i wa engag
in write at home she would sit quietli near me howev late the
hour and be so mute that i would often think she had drop asleep
but gener when i rais my head i saw her blue ey look at me
with the quiet attent of which i have alreadi spoken
oh what a weari boi said dora on night when i met her ey as i
wa shut up my desk

chapter 45 mr dick fulfil my aunt predict
it wa some time now sinc i had left the doctor live in hi
neighbourhood i saw him frequent and we all went to hi hous on two
or three occas to dinner or tea the old soldier wa in perman
quarter under the doctor roof she wa exactli the same as ever and
the same immort butterfli hover over her cap
like some other mother whom i have known in the cours of my life
mr markleham wa far more fond of pleasur than her daughter wa
she requir a great deal of amus and like a deep old soldier
pretend in consult her own inclin to be devot herself
to her child the doctor desir that anni should be entertain
wa therefor particularli accept to thi excel parent who
express unqualifi approv of hi discret
i have no doubt inde that she probe the doctor wound without
know it mean noth but a certain matur frivol and
selfish not alwai insepar from fullblown year i think she
confirm him in hi fear that he wa a constraint upon hi young
wife and that there wa no congeni of feel between them by so
strongli commend hi design of lighten the load of her life
my dear soul she said to him on dai when i wa present you know
there is no doubt it would be a littl pokei for anni to be alwai shut
up here
the doctor nod hi benevol head when she come to her mother

anoth thing you might put me into a jail with genteel societi and
a rubber and i should never care to come out but i am not anni you

chapter 46 intellig
i must have been marri if i mai trust to my imperfect memori for
date about a year or so when on even as i wa return from a
solitari walk think of the book i wa then writingfor my success
had steadili increas with my steadi applic and i wa engag at
that time upon my first work of fictioni came past mr steerforth
hous i had often pass it befor dure my resid in that
neighbourhood though never when i could choos anoth road howbeit
it did sometim happen that it wa not easi to find anoth without
make a long circuit and so i had pass that wai upon the whole
pretti often
i had never done more than glanc at the hous as i went by with a
quicken step it had been uniformli gloomi and dull none of the best
room abut on the road and the narrow heavilyfram oldfashion
window never cheer under ani circumst look veri dismal
close shut and with their blind alwai drawn down there wa a cover
wai across a littl pave court to an entranc that wa never us and
there wa on round staircas window at odd with all the rest and the
onli on unshad by a blind which had the same unoccupi blank look
i do not rememb that i ever saw a light in all the hous if i had
been a casual passerbi i should have probabl suppos that some
childless person lai dead in it if i had happili possess no knowledg
of the place and had seen it often in that changeless state i should
have pleas my fanci with mani ingeni specul i dare sai
as it wa i thought as littl of it as i might but my mind could not
go by it and leav it as my bodi did and it usual awaken a long
train of medit come befor me on thi particular even that
i mention mingl with the childish recollect and later fanci
the ghost of halfform hope the broken shadow of disappoint
dimli seen and understood the blend of experi and imagin
incident to the occup with which my thought had been busi it
wa more than commonli suggest i fell into a brown studi as i walk
on and a voic at my side made me start
it wa a woman voic too i wa not long in recollect mr
steerforth littl parlourmaid who had formerli worn blue ribbon in
her cap she had taken them out now to adapt herself i suppos to
the alter charact of the hous and wore but on or two disconsol
bow of sober brown
if you pleas sir would you have the good to walk in and speak
to miss dartl
ha miss dartl sent you for me i inquir
not tonight sir but it just the same miss dartl saw you pass a
night or two ago and i wa to sit at work on the staircas and when i
saw you pass again to ask you to step in and speak to her
i turn back and inquir of my conductor as we went along how mr
steerforth wa she said her ladi wa but poorli and kept her own room
a good deal
when we arriv at the hous i wa direct to miss dartl in the
garden and left to make my presenc known to her myself she wa
sit on a seat at on end of a kind of terrac overlook the great
citi it wa a sombr even with a lurid light in the sky and as
i saw the prospect scowl in the distanc with here and there some
larger object start up into the sullen glare i fanci it wa no
inapt companion to the memori of thi fierc woman
she saw me as i advanc and rose for a moment to receiv me i thought
her then still more colourless and thin than when i had seen her last
the flash ey still brighter and the scar still plainer
our meet wa not cordial we had part angrili on the last occas
and there wa an air of disdain about her which she took no pain to
conceal
i am told you wish to speak to me miss dartl said i stand near
her with my hand upon the back of the seat and declin her gestur
of invit to sit down
if you pleas said she prai ha thi girl been found
no
and yet she ha run awai
i saw her thin lip work while she look at me as if thei were
eager to load her with reproach
run awai i repeat
ye from him she said with a laugh if she is not found perhap
she never will be found she mai be dead
the vaunt cruelti with which she met my glanc i never saw express
in ani other face that ever i have seen
to wish her dead said i mai be the kindest wish that on of her own
sex could bestow upon her i am glad that time ha soften you so much
miss dartl
she condescend to make no repli but turn on me with anoth
scorn laugh said

a wall of holli that wa near at hand divid the lawn from a
kitchengarden said in a louder voic come herea if she were
call to some unclean beast

place of cours mr copperfield said she look over her shoulder
at me with the same express
i inclin my head without know what she meant and she said come

who with undiminish respect made me a bow and took up hi
posit behind her the air of wick grace of triumph in which
strang to sai there wa yet someth feminin and allur with
which she reclin upon the seat between us and look at me wa
worthi of a cruel princess in a legend
now said she imperi without glanc at him and touch
the old wound as it throb perhap in thi instanc with pleasur
rather than pain tell mr copperfield about the flight

sinc she left yarmouth under mr jamess protect we have been in a
varieti of place and seen a deal of foreign countri we have been in
franc switzerland itali in fact almost all part

that and softli plai upon it with hi hand as if he were strike
chord upon a dumb piano
mr jame took quit uncommonli to the young woman and wa more
settl for a length of time than i have known him to be sinc i have
been in hi servic the young woman wa veri improv and spoke the
languag and wouldnt have been known for the same countryperson i
notic that she wa much admir wherev we went
miss dartl put her hand upon her side i saw him steal a glanc at her

take hi hand from the seat and place on of them within the
other as he settl himself on on leg mr littim proceed with
hi ey cast down and hi respect head a littl advanc and a
littl on on side
the young woman went on in thi manner for some time be
occasion low in her spirit until i think she began to weari mr
jame by give wai to her low spirit and temper of that kind and
thing were not so comfort mr jame he began to be restless again
the more restless he got the wors she got and i must sai for myself
that i had a veri difficult time of it inde between the two still
matter were patch up here and made good there over and over again
and altogeth last i am sure for a longer time than anybodi could
have expect
recal her ey from the distanc she look at me again now with
her former air mr littim clear hi throat behind hi hand with a
respect short cough chang leg and went on
at last when there had been upon the whole a good mani word and
reproach mr jame he set off on morn from the neighbourhood of

the sea and under pretenc of come back in a dai or so left it in
charg with me to break it out that for the gener happi of all
concern he washer an interrupt of the short coughgon but

be held by forc or if she couldnt have got to a knife or got to the
sea shed have beaten her head against the marbl floor
miss dartl lean back upon the seat with a light of exult in
her face seem almost to caress the sound thi fellow had utter
but when i came to the second part of what had been entrust to me
said mr littim rub hi hand uneasili which anybodi might
have suppos would have been at all event appreci as a kind
intent then the young woman came out in her true colour a more
outrag person i never did see her conduct wa surprisingli bad she
had no more gratitud no more feel no more patienc no more reason
in her than a stock or a stone if i hadnt been upon my guard i am
convinc she would have had my blood

with that he made a polit bow and with anoth to miss dartl went
awai through the arch in the wall of holli by which he had come miss
dartl and i regard each other for a littl while in silenc her
manner be exactli what it wa when she had produc the man

coars a wretch is capabl of feel have sent for you to hear what

i saw by the chang in her face that someon wa advanc behind me
it wa mr steerforth who gave me her hand more coldli than of yore
and with an augment of her former stateli of manner but still
i perceivedand i wa touch by itwith an ineffac remembr
of my old love for her son she wa greatli alter her fine figur wa
far less upright her handsom face wa deepli mark and her hair wa
almost white but when she sat down on the seat she wa a handsom ladi
still and well i knew the bright ey with it lofti look that had been
a light in my veri dream at school

ye i have told him why you wish it you ar a good girl i have
had some slight correspond with your former friend sir address

therefor i have no other object in thi than what rosa ha mention
if by the cours which mai reliev the mind of the decent man you
brought here for whom i am sorryi can sai no more my son mai be
save from again fall into the snare of a design enemi well
she drew herself up and sat look straight befor her far awai
madam i said respectfulli i understand i assur you i am in no
danger of put ani strain construct on your motiv but i must
sai even to you have known thi injur famili from childhood
that if you suppos the girl so deepli wrong ha not been cruelli
delud and would not rather die a hundr death than take a cup of
water from your son hand now you cherish a terribl mistak
well rosa well said mr steerforth as the other wa about to
interpos it is no matter let it be you ar marri sir i am

night
i took the hand she held out with a dignifi unbend air and it
wa as calm in mine as if her breast had been at peac her pride could
still it veri puls it appear and draw the placid veil befor
her face through which she sat look straight befor her on the far
distanc
as i move awai from them along the terrac i could not help observ
how steadili thei both sat gaze on the prospect and how it thicken
and close around them here and there some earli lamp were seen to
twinkl in the distant citi and in the eastern quarter of the sky
the lurid light still hover but from the greater part of the broad
vallei interpos a mist wa rise like a sea which mingl with
the dark made it seem as if the gather water would encompass
them i have reason to rememb thi and think of it with aw for
befor i look upon those two again a stormi sea had risen to their
feet
reflect on what had been thu told me i felt it right that it should
be commun to mr peggotti on the follow even i went into
london in quest of him he wa alwai wander about from place to
place with hi on object of recov hi niec befor him but wa
more in london than elsewher often and often now had i seen him in
the dead of night pass along the street search among the few
who loiter out of door at those untim hour for what he dread
to find

which i have had occas to mention more than onc and from which he
first went forth upon hi errand of merci hither i direct my walk on

gradual remov hi ey from mine he sat look downward lean
hi forehead on hi hand he offer no interrupt but remain
throughout perfectli still he seem to pursu her figur through
the narr and to let everi other shape go by him as if it were
noth
when i had done he shade hi face and continu silent i look out
of the window for a littl while and occupi myself with the plant
how do you fare to feel about it masr davi he inquir at length

we had come through templ bar into the citi convers no more now
and walk at my side he yield himself up to the on aim of hi
devot life and went on with that hush concentr of hi
faculti which would have made hi figur solitari in a multitud
we were not far from blackfriar bridg when he turn hi head and
point to a solitari femal figur flit along the opposit side of
the street i knew it readili to be the figur that we sought
we cross the road and were press on toward her when it occur
to me that she might be more dispos to feel a woman interest in the
lost girl if we spoke to her in a quieter place aloof from the crowd
and where we should be less observ i advis my companion therefor
that we should not address her yet but follow her consult in thi
likewis an indistinct desir i had to know where she went
he acquiesc we follow at a distanc never lose sight of her
but never care to come veri near as she frequent look about
onc she stop to listen to a band of music and then we stop too
she went on a long wai still we went on it wa evid from the
manner in which she held her cours that she wa go to some fix
destin and thi and her keep in the busi street and i
suppos the strang fascin in the secreci and mysteri of so
follow anyon made me adher to my first purpos at length she
turn into a dull dark street where the nois and crowd were lost
and i said we mai speak to her now and mend our pace we went
after her
chapter 47 martha
we were now down in westminst we had turn back to follow her
have encount her come toward us and westminst abbei wa
the point at which she pass from the light and nois of the lead
street she proceed so quickli when she got free of the two current
of passeng set toward and from the bridg that between thi
and the advanc she had of us when she struck off we were in the narrow
watersid street by millbank befor we came up with her at that moment
she cross the road as if to avoid the footstep that she heard so
close behind and without look back pass on even more rapidli
a glimps of the river through a dull gatewai where some waggon were
hous for the night seem to arrest my feet i touch my companion
without speak and we both forbor to cross after her and both
follow on that opposit side of the wai keep as quietli as we
could in the shadow of the hous but keep veri near her
there wa and is when i write at the end of that lowli street
a dilapid littl wooden build probabl an obsolet old
ferryhous it posit is just at that point where the street ceas
and the road begin to lie between a row of hous and the river as
soon as she came here and saw the water she stop as if she had come
to her destin and present went slowli along by the brink of the
river look intent at it
all the wai here i had suppos that she wa go to some hous
inde i had vagu entertain the hope that the hous might be in
some wai associ with the lost girl but that on dark glimps of the
river through the gatewai had instinct prepar me for her go
no farther
the neighbourhood wa a dreari on at that time as oppress sad and
solitari by night as ani about london there were neither wharv nor
hous on the melancholi wast of road near the great blank prison a
sluggish ditch deposit it mud at the prison wall coars grass and
rank weed straggl over all the marshi land in the vicin in on
part carcas of hous inauspici begun and never finish

and slush to the ebbtid there wa a stori that on of the pit
dug for the dead in the time of the great plagu wa hereabout and
a blight influenc seem to have proceed from it over the whole
place or els it look as if it had gradual decompos into that
nightmar condit out of the overflow of the pollut stream
as if she were a part of the refus it had cast out and left to
corrupt and decai the girl we had follow strai down to the
river brink and stood in the midst of thi nightpictur lone and
still look at the water
there were some boat and barg astrand in the mud and these enabl
us to come within a few yard of her without be seen i then sign
to mr peggotti to remain where he wa and emerg from their shade to
speak to her i did not approach her solitari figur without trembl
for thi gloomi end to her determin walk and the wai in which she
stood almost within the cavern shadow of the iron bridg look
at the light crookedli reflect in the strong tide inspir a dread
within me
i think she wa talk to herself i am sure although absorb in
gaze at the water that her shawl wa off her shoulder and that she
wa muffl her hand in it in an unsettl and bewild wai more
like the action of a sleepwalk than a wake person i know and
never can forget that there wa that in her wild manner which gave me
no assur but that she would sink befor my ey until i had her arm
within my grasp
at the same moment i said martha
she utter a terrifi scream and struggl with me with such strength
that i doubt if i could have held her alon but a stronger hand than
mine wa laid upon her and when she rais her frighten ey and saw
whose it wa she made but on more effort and drop down between us
we carri her awai from the water to where there were some dry stone
and there laid her down cry and moan in a littl while she sat
among the stone hold her wretch head with both her hand

mr peggotti whether it would not seem in the onset like distrust
her to follow her ani farther he be of the same mind and equal
reliant on her we suffer her to take her own road and took our
which wa toward highgat he accompani me a good part of the wai
and when we part with a prayer for the success of thi fresh effort

i labour hard at my book without allow it to interfer with the
punctual discharg of my newspap duti and it came out and wa veri
success i wa not stun by the prais which sound in my ear
notwithstand that i wa keenli aliv to it and thought better of
my own perform i have littl doubt than anybodi els did it ha
alwai been in my observ of human natur that a man who ha ani
good reason to believ in himself never flourish himself befor the
face of other peopl in order that thei mai believ in him for thi
reason i retain my modesti in veri selfrespect and the more prais
i got the more i tri to deserv
it is not my purpos in thi record though in all other essenti
it is my written memori to pursu the histori of my own fiction thei
express themselv and i leav them to themselv when i refer to
them incident it is onli as a part of my progress
have some foundat for believ by thi time that natur and
accid had made me an author i pursu my vocat with confid
without such assur i should certainli have left it alon and
bestow my energi on some other endeavour i should have tri to find
out what natur and accid realli had made me and to be that and
noth els i had been write in the newspap and elsewher so
prosper that when my new success wa achiev i consid myself
reason entitl to escap from the dreari debat on joy night
therefor i note down the music of the parliamentari bagpip for the
last time and i have never heard it sinc though i still recogn the
old drone in the newspap without ani substanti variat except
perhap that there is more of it all the livelong session
i now write of the time when i had been marri i suppos about a year
and a half after sever varieti of experi we had given up the
housekeep as a bad job the hous kept itself and we kept a page
the princip function of thi retain wa to quarrel with the cook
in which respect he wa a perfect whittington without hi cat or the
remotest chanc of be made lord mayor
he appear to me to have live in a hail of saucepanlid hi whole
exist wa a scuffl he would shriek for help on the most improp
occasionsa when we had a littl dinnerparti or a few friend in
the eveningand would come tumbl out of the kitchen with iron
missil fly after him we want to get rid of him but he wa veri
much attach to us and wouldnt go he wa a tear boi and broke
into such deplor lament when a cessat of our connexion
wa hint at that we were oblig to keep him he had no motherno
anyth in the wai of a rel that i could discov except a
sister who fled to america the moment we had taken him off her hand
and he becam quarter on us like a horribl young changel he had
a live percept of hi own unfortun state and wa alwai rub
hi ey with the sleev of hi jacket or stoop to blow hi nose on
the extrem corner of a littl pockethandkerchief which he never would
take complet out of hi pocket but alwai econom and secret
thi unlucki page engag in an evil hour at six pound ten per annum
wa a sourc of continu troubl to me i watch him as he grewand
he grew like scarlet beanswith pain apprehens of the time when
he would begin to shave even of the dai when he would be bald or grei
i saw no prospect of ever get rid of him and project myself
into the futur us to think what an inconveni he would be when he
wa an old man
i never expect anyth less than thi unfortun manner of
get me out of my difficulti he stole dora watch which like
everyth els belong to us had no particular place of it own
and convert it into monei spent the produc he wa alwai a
weakmind boi in incessantli ride up and down between london and
uxbridg outsid the coach he wa taken to bow street as well as
i rememb on the complet of hi fifteenth journei when
fourandsixp and a secondhand fife which he couldnt plai were
found upon hi person
the surpris and it consequ would have been much less disagre
to me if he had not been penit but he wa veri penit inde and
in a peculiar waynot in the lump but by instal for exampl
the dai after that on which i wa oblig to appear against him he made
certain revel touch a hamper in the cellar which we believ
to be full of wine but which had noth in it except bottl and
cork we suppos he had now eas hi mind and told the worst he knew
of the cook but a dai or two afterward hi conscienc sustain a
new twing and he disclos how she had a littl girl who earli everi
morn took awai our bread and also how he himself had been suborn
to maintain the milkman in coal in two or three dai more i wa
inform by the author of hi have led to the discoveri of
sirloin of beef among the kitchenstuff and sheet in the ragbag a
littl while afterward he broke out in an entir new direct and
confess to a knowledg of burglari intent as to our premis
on the part of the potboi who wa immedi taken up i got to be so
asham of be such a victim that i would have given him ani monei
to hold hi tongu or would have offer a round bribe for hi be
permit to run awai it wa an aggrav circumst in the case
that he had no idea of thi but conceiv that he wa make me amend
in everi new discoveri not to sai heap oblig on my head
at last i ran awai myself whenev i saw an emissari of the polic
approach with some new intellig and live a stealthi life until
he wa tri and order to be transport even then he couldnt be
quiet but wa alwai write us letter and want so much to see dora
befor he went awai that dora went to visit him and faint when she
found herself insid the iron bar in short i had no peac of my life
until he wa expatri and made as i afterward heard a shepherd
of up the countri somewher i have no geograph idea where
all thi led me into some seriou reflect and present our
mistak in a new aspect as i could not help commun to dora on
even in spite of my tender for her
my love said i it is veri pain to me to think that our want of
system and manag involv not onli ourselv which we have got
us to but other peopl
you have been silent for a long time and now you ar go to be
cross said dora
no my dear inde let me explain to you what i mean
i think i dont want to know said dora
but i want you to know my love put jip down
dora put hi nose to mine and said boh to drive my serious awai
but not succeed order him into hi pagoda and sat look at
me with her hand fold and a most resign littl express of
counten
the fact is my dear i began there is contagion in us we infect
everyon about us
i might have gone on in thi figur manner if dora face had not
admonish me that she wa wonder with all her might whether i wa
go to propos ani new kind of vaccin or other medic remedi
for thi unwholesom state of our therefor i check myself and made
my mean plainer
it is not mere my pet said i that we lose monei and comfort and
even temper sometim by not learn to be more care but that we
incur the seriou respons of spoil everyon who come into
our servic or ha ani deal with us i begin to be afraid that the
fault is not entir on on side but that these peopl all turn out
ill becaus we dont turn out veri well ourselv
oh what an accus exclaim dora open her ey wide to sai
that you ever saw me take gold watch oh
my dearest i remonstr dont talk preposter nonsens who ha
made the least allus to gold watch
you did return dora you know you did you said i hadnt turn
out well and compar me to him
to whom i ask
to the page sob dora oh you cruel fellow to compar your
affection wife to a transport page why didnt you tell me
your opinion of me befor we were marri why didnt you sai
you hardheart thing that you were convinc i wa wors than a
transport page oh what a dread opinion to have of me oh my
good
now dora my love i return gentli try to remov the
handkerchief she press to her ey thi is not onli veri ridicul
of you but veri wrong in the first place it not true
you alwai said he wa a storytel sob dora and now you sai
the same of me oh what shall i do what shall i do
my darl girl i retort i realli must entreat you to be
reason and listen to what i did sai and do sai my dear dora
unless we learn to do our duti to those whom we emploi thei will never
learn to do their duti to us i am afraid we present opportun to
peopl to do wrong that never ought to be present even if we were
as lax as we ar in all our arrang by choicewhich we ar
noteven if we like it and found it agreeabl to be sowhich we
donti am persuad we should have no right to go on in thi wai we
ar posit corrupt peopl we ar bound to think of that i cant
help think of it dora it is a reflect i am unabl to dismiss
and it sometim make me veri uneasi there dear that all come
now dont be foolish
dora would not allow me for a long time to remov the handkerchief
she sat sob and murmur behind it that if i wa uneasi why had
i ever been marri why hadnt i said even the dai befor we went to
church that i knew i should be uneasi and i would rather not if i
couldnt bear her why didnt i send her awai to her aunt at putnei or
to julia mill in india julia would be glad to see her and would not
call her a transport page julia never had call her anyth of the
sort in short dora wa so afflict and so afflict me by be
in that condit that i felt it wa of no us repeat thi kind of
effort though never so mildli and i must take some other cours
what other cours wa left to take to form her mind thi wa a
common phrase of word which had a fair and promis sound and i
resolv to form dora mind
i began immedi when dora wa veri childish and i would
have infinit prefer to humour her i tri to be graveand
disconcert her and myself too i talk to her on the subject which
occupi my thought and i read shakespear to herand fatigu her
to the last degre i accustom myself to give her as it were quit
casual littl scrap of us inform or sound opinionand she
start from them when i let them off as if thei had been cracker
no matter how incident or natur i endeavour to form my littl
wife mind i could not help see that she alwai had an instinct
percept of what i wa about and becam a prei to the keenest
apprehens in particular it wa clear to me that she thought
shakespear a terribl fellow the format went on veri slowli
i press traddl into the servic without hi knowledg and whenev
he came to see us explod my mine upon him for the edif of
dora at second hand the amount of practic wisdom i bestow upon
traddl in thi manner wa immens and of the best qualiti but it
had no other effect upon dora than to depress her spirit and make her
alwai nervou with the dread that it would be her turn next i found
myself in the condit of a schoolmast a trap a pitfal of alwai
plai spider to dora fly and alwai pounc out of my hole to her
infinit disturb
still look forward through thi intermedi stage to the time
when there should be a perfect sympathi between dora and me and when i
should have form her mind to my entir satisfact i persev
even for month find at last howev that although i had been
all thi time a veri porcupin or hedgehog bristl all over with
determin i had effect noth it began to occur to me that
perhap dora mind wa alreadi form
on further consider thi appear so like that i abandon
my scheme which had had a more promis appear in word than in
action resolv henceforth to be satisfi with my childwif and to
try to chang her into noth els by ani process i wa heartili tire
of be sagaci and prudent by myself and of see my darl under
restraint so i bought a pretti pair of ear for her and a collar
for jip and went home on dai to make myself agreeabl
dora wa delight with the littl present and kiss me joyfulli but
there wa a shadow between us howev slight and i had made up my mind
that it should not be there if there must be such a shadow anywher i
would keep it for the futur in my own breast
i sat down by my wife on the sofa and put the ear in her ear
and then i told her that i fear we had not been quit as good compani
late as we us to be and that the fault wa mine which i sincer
felt and which inde it wa
the truth is dora my life i said i have been try to be wise
and to make me wise too said dora timidli havent you doadi
i nod assent to the pretti inquiri of the rais eyebrow and kiss
the part lip

ear rang again you know what a littl thing i am and what i
want you to call me from the first if you cant do so i am afraid
youll never like me ar you sure you dont think sometim it would
have been better to have
done what my dear for she made no effort to proce
noth said dora

she put her arm round my neck and laugh and call herself by her
favourit name of a goos and hid her face on my shoulder in such a
profus of curl that it wa quit a task to clear them awai and see
it
dont i think it would have been better to have done noth than to
have tri to form my littl wife mind said i laugh at myself
is that the question ye inde i do
is that what you have been try cri dora oh what a shock
boi
but i shall never try ani more said i for i love her dearli as she

better to be natur dora than anyth els in the world
in the world ah doadi it a larg place
she shook her head turn her delight bright ey up to mine kiss
me broke into a merri laugh and sprang awai to put on jip new
collar
so end my last attempt to make ani chang in dora i had been unhappi
in try it i could not endur my own solitari wisdom i could not
reconcil it with her former appeal to me as my childwif i resolv
to do what i could in a quiet wai to improv our proceed myself
but i foresaw that my utmost would be veri littl or i must degener
into the spider again and be for ever ly in wait
and the shadow i have mention that wa not to be between us ani more
but wa to rest wholli on my own heart how did that fall
the old unhappi feel pervad my life it wa deepen if it were
chang at all but it wa as undefin as ever and address me like
a strain of sorrow music faintli heard in the night i love my wife
dearli and i wa happi but the happi i had vagu anticip
onc wa not the happi i enjoi and there wa alwai someth
want
in fulfil of the compact i have made with myself to reflect my mind
on thi paper i again examin it close and bring it secret to the
light what i miss i still regardedi alwai regardeda someth
that had been a dream of my youth fanci that wa incap of
realiz that i wa now discov to be so with some natur
pain as all men did but that it would have been better for me if my
wife could have help me more and share the mani thought in which i
had no partner and that thi might have been i knew
between these two irreconcil conclus the on that what i felt
wa gener and unavoid the other that it wa particular to me
and might have been differ i balanc curious with no distinct
sens of their opposit to each other when i thought of the airi
dream of youth that ar incap of realiz i thought of the
better state preced manhood that i had outgrown and then the
content dai with agn in the dear old hous aros befor me like
spectr of the dead that might have some renew in anoth world but
never more could be reanim here
sometim the specul came into my thought what might have
happen or what would have happen if dora and i had never known
each other but she wa so incorpor with my exist that it
wa the idlest of all fanci and would soon rise out of my reach and
sight like gossam float in the air
i alwai love her what i am describ slumber and half awok and
slept again in the innermost recess of my mind there wa no evid
of it in me i know of no influenc it had in anyth i said or did i
bore the weight of all our littl care and all my project dora held
the pen and we both felt that our share were adjust as the case
requir she wa truli fond of me and proud of me and when agn
wrote a few earnest word in her letter to dora of the pride and
interest with which my old friend heard of my grow reput and
read my book as if thei heard me speak it content dora read them
out to me with tear of joi in her bright ey and said i wa a dear
old clever famou boi
the first mistaken impuls of an undisciplin heart those word of
mr strong were constantli recur to me at thi time were almost
alwai present to my mind i awok with them often in the night i
rememb to have even read them in dream inscrib upon the wall
of hous for i knew now that my own heart wa undisciplin when it
first love dora and that if it had been disciplin it never
could have felt when we were marri what it had felt in it secret
experi
there can be no dispar in marriag like unsuit of mind and
purpos those word i rememb too i had endeavour to adapt
dora to myself and found it impractic it remain for me to adapt
myself to dora to share with her what i could and be happi to bear
on my own shoulder what i must and be happi still thi wa the
disciplin to which i tri to bring my heart when i began to think
it made my second year much happier than my first and what wa better
still made dora life all sunshin
but as that year wore on dora wa not strong i had hope that lighter
hand than mine would help to mould her charact and that a babysmil
upon her breast might chang my childwif to a woman it wa not to be
the spirit flutter for a moment on the threshold of it littl prison
and unconsci of captiv took wing
when i can run about again as i us to do aunt said dora i shall

myself until on night when it wa veri strong upon me and my aunt
had left her with a part cry of good night littl blossom i sat

address to m e post offic canterburi will be fraught with
less pain consequ than ani address immedi to on who
subscrib herself in extrem distress
mr thoma traddless respect friend and suppliant
emma micawb
what do you think of that letter said traddl cast hi ey upon
me when i had read it twice
what do you think of the other said i for he wa still read it
with knit brow
i think that the two togeth copperfield repli traddl
mean more than mr and mr micawb usual mean in their
correspondencebut i dont know what thei ar both written in good
faith i have no doubt and without ani collus poor thing he wa
now allud to mr micawb letter and we were stand side by
side compar the two it will be a chariti to write to her at all
event and tell her that we will not fail to see mr micawb
i acced to thi the more readili becaus i now reproach myself with
have treat her former letter rather lightli it had set me think
a good deal at the time as i have mention in it place but my
absorpt in my own affair my experi of the famili and my
hear noth more had gradual end in my dismiss the subject
i had often thought of the micawb but chiefli to wonder what
pecuniari liabil thei were establish in canterburi and to
recal how shy mr micawb wa of me when he becam clerk to uriah
heep
howev i now wrote a comfort letter to mr micawb in our
joint name and we both sign it as we walk into town to post it
traddl and i held a long confer and launch into a number of
specul which i need not repeat we took my aunt into our counsel
in the afternoon but our onli decid conclus wa that we would be
veri punctual in keep mr micawb appoint
although we appear at the stipul place a quarter of an hour befor
the time we found mr micawb alreadi there he wa stand with hi
arm fold over against the wall look at the spike on the top
with a sentiment express as if thei were the interlac bough of
tree that had shade him in hi youth
when we accost him hi manner wa someth more confus and
someth less genteel than of yore he had relinquish hi legal suit
of black for the purpos of thi excurs and wore the old surtout
and tight but not quit with the old air he gradual pick up more
and more of it as we convers with him but hi veri eyeglass seem
to hang less easili and hi shirtcollar though still of the old
formid dimens rather droop
gentlemen said mr micawb after the first salut you ar
friend in need and friend inde allow me to offer my inquiri with
refer to the physic welfar of mr copperfield in ess and
mr traddl in possepresum that is to sai that my friend mr
traddl is not yet unit to the object of hi affect for weal and
for woe

chapter 50 mr peggotti dream come true
by thi time some month had pass sinc our interview on the bank
of the river with martha i had never seen her sinc but she had
commun with mr peggotti on sever occas noth had come of
her zealou intervent nor could i infer from what he told me that
ani clue had been obtain for a moment to emili fate i confess
that i began to despair of her recoveri and gradual to sink deeper
and deeper into the belief that she wa dead
hi convict remain unchang so far as i knowand i believ
hi honest heart wa transpar to mehe never waver again in hi
solemn certainti of find her hi patienc never tire and although
i trembl for the agoni it might on dai be to him to have hi strong
assur shiver at a blow there wa someth so religi in it so
affectingli express of it anchor be in the purest depth of
hi fine natur that the respect and honour in which i held him were
exalt everi dai
hi wa not a lazi trust that hope and did no more he had
been a man of sturdi action all hi life and he knew that in all thing
wherein he want help he must do hi own part faithfulli and help
himself i have known him set out in the night on a misgiv that the
light might not be by some accid in the window of the old boat
and walk to yarmouth i have known him on read someth in the
newspap that might appli to her take up hi stick and go forth on a
journei of threeor fourscor mile he made hi wai by sea to napl
and back after hear the narr to which miss dartl had assist
me all hi journei were ruggedli perform for he wa alwai
steadfast in a purpos of save monei for emili sake when she should
be found in all thi long pursuit i never heard him repin i never
heard him sai he wa fatigu or out of heart
dora had often seen him sinc our marriag and wa quit fond of him
i fanci hi figur befor me now stand near her sofa with hi rough
cap in hi hand and the blue ey of my childwif rais with a timid
wonder to hi face sometim of an even about twilight when
he came to talk with me i would induc him to smoke hi pipe in the
garden as we slowli pace to and fro togeth and then the pictur
of hi desert home and the comfort air it us to have in my
childish ey of an even when the fire wa burn and the wind
moan round it came most vividli into my mind
on even at thi hour he told me that he had found martha wait
near hi lodg on the preced night when he came out and that she
had ask him not to leav london on ani account until he should have
seen her again
did she tell you why i inquir
i ask her masr davi he repli but it is but few word as she
ever sai and she oni got my promis and so went awai
did she sai when you might expect to see her again i demand
no masr davi he return draw hi hand thoughtfulli down hi
face i ask that too but it wa more she said than she could
tell
as i had long forborn to encourag him with hope that hung on thread
i made no other comment on thi inform than that i suppos he
would see her soon such specul as it engend within me i kept
to myself and those were faint enough
i wa walk alon in the garden on even about a fortnight
afterward i rememb that even well it wa the second in mr
micawb week of suspens there had been rain all dai and there wa
a damp feel in the air the leav were thick upon the tree and
heavi with wet but the rain had ceas though the sky wa still dark
and the hope bird were sing cheerfulli as i walk to and fro
in the garden and the twilight began to close around me their littl
voic were hush and that peculiar silenc which belong to such an
even in the countri when the lightest tree ar quit still save for
the occasion drop from their bough prevail
there wa a littl green perspect of trelliswork and ivi at the side
of our cottag through which i could see from the garden where i wa
walk into the road befor the hous i happen to turn my ey
toward thi place as i wa think of mani thing and i saw a figur
beyond dress in a plain cloak it wa bend eagerli toward me and
beckon
martha said i go to it
can you come with me she inquir in an agit whisper i have
been to him and he is not at home i wrote down where he wa to come
and left it on hi tabl with my own hand thei said he would not be out
long i have tide for him can you come directli
my answer wa to pass out at the gate immedi she made a hasti
gestur with her hand as if to entreat my patienc and my silenc
and turn toward london whenc as her dress betoken she had come
expediti on foot
i ask her if that were not our destin on her motion ye
with the same hasti gestur as befor i stop an empti coach that wa
come by and we got into it when i ask her where the coachman wa
to drive she answer anywher near golden squar and quickthen
shrunk into a corner with on trembl hand befor her face and the
other make the former gestur as if she could not bear a voic
now much disturb and dazzl with conflict gleam of hope and
dread i look at her for some explan but see how strongli
she desir to remain quiet and feel that it wa my own natur
inclin too at such a time i did not attempt to break the silenc
we proceed without a word be spoken sometim she glanc out of
the window as though she thought we were go slowli though inde we
were go fast but otherwis remain exactli as at first
we alight at on of the entranc to the squar she had mention
where i direct the coach to wait not know but that we might have
some occas for it she laid her hand on my arm and hurri me on
to on of the sombr street of which there ar sever in that part
where the hous were onc fair dwell in the occup of singl
famili but have and had long degener into poor lodg let off
in room enter at the open door of on of these and releas my
arm she beckon me to follow her up the common staircas which wa
like a tributari channel to the street
the hous swarm with inmat as we went up door of room were
open and peopl head put out and we pass other peopl on the
stair who were come down in glanc up from the outsid befor
we enter i had seen women and children loll at the window over
flowerpot and we seem to have attract their curios for these
were princip the observ who look out of their door it wa a
broad panel staircas with massiv balustrad of some dark wood
cornic abov the door ornament with carv fruit and flower and
broad seat in the window but all these token of past grandeur
were miser decai and dirti rot damp and ag had weaken
the floor which in mani place wa unsound and even unsaf some
attempt had been made i notic to infus new blood into thi
dwindl frame by repair the costli old woodwork here and there
with common deal but it wa like the marriag of a reduc old nobl to
a plebeian pauper and each parti to the illassort union shrunk awai
from the other sever of the back window on the staircas had
been darken or wholli block up in those that remain there wa
scarc ani glass and through the crumbl frame by which the bad
air seem alwai to come in and never to go out i saw through other
glassless window into other hous in a similar condit and look
giddili down into a wretch yard which wa the common dustheap of the
mansion
we proceed to the topstorei of the hous two or three time by the
wai i thought i observ in the indistinct light the skirt of a femal
figur go up befor us as we turn to ascend the last flight of
stair between us and the roof we caught a full view of thi figur
paus for a moment at a door then it turn the handl and went in
what thi said martha in a whisper she ha gone into my room i
dont know her
i knew her i had recogn her with amaz for miss dartl
i said someth to the effect that it wa a ladi whom i had seen
befor in a few word to my conductress and had scarc done so
when we heard her voic in the room though not from where we stood
what she wa sai martha with an astonish look repeat her
former action and softli led me up the stair and then by a littl
backdoor which seem to have no lock and which she push open with a
touch into a small empti garret with a low slope roof littl better
than a cupboard between thi and the room she had call her
there wa a small door of commun stand partli open here we
stop breathless with our ascent and she place her hand lightli on
my lip i could onli see of the room beyond that it wa pretti larg
that there wa a bed in it and that there were some common pictur of
ship upon the wall i could not see miss dartl or the person whom
we had heard her address certainli my companion could not for my
posit wa the best a dead silenc prevail for some moment martha
kept on hand on my lip and rais the other in a listen attitud

at the sound of it a thrill went through my frame for it wa emili

passionwast figur and i saw the scar with it white track cut
through her lip quiver and throb as she spoke

ran awai with him and is the towntalk of the commonest peopl of her
nativ place the bold flaunt practis companion of person like
jame steerforth i want to know what such a thing is like
there wa a rustl as if the unhappi girl on whom she heap these
taunt ran toward the door and the speaker swiftli interpos herself
befor it it wa succeed by a moment paus
when miss dartl spoke again it wa through her set teeth and with a
stamp upon the ground
stai there she said or ill proclaim you to the hous and the
whole street if you try to evad me ill stop you if it by the
hair and rais the veri stone against you

succeed i did not know what to do much as i desir to put an end to
the interview i felt that i had no right to present myself that it wa
for mr peggotti alon to see her and recov her would he never come

why he wa a poor creatur to be taken by that delic mockmodesti

abhorr of you it would freez it up our sex you ar an honour to

miss dartl place herself in a chair within view of the door and
look downward as if emili were crouch on the floor befor her
be now between me and the light i could see her curl lip and her
cruel ey intent fix on on place with a greedi triumph
listen to what i sai she said and reserv your fals art for your
dupe do you hope to move me by your tear no more than you could
charm me by your smile you purchas slave
oh have some merci on me cri emili show me some compass or i

be in the lost dai when i turn my back upon it for ever and for ever
oh home home oh dear dear uncl if you ever could have known the
agoni your love would caus me when i fell awai from good you never

some comfort i have none none no comfort upon earth for all of them

figur in the chair with an implor effort to clasp the skirt of her
dress
rosa dartl sat look down upon her as inflex as a figur of
brass her lip were tightli compress as if she knew that she
must keep a strong constraint upon herselfi write what i sincer
believeor she would be tempt to strike the beauti form with
her foot i saw her distinctli and the whole power of her face and
charact seem forc into that expressionwould he never come
the miser vaniti of these earthworm she said when she had so
far control the angri heav of her breast that she could trust
herself to speak your home do you imagin that i bestow a thought
on it or suppos you could do ani harm to that low place which monei
would not pai for and handsom your home you were a part of the
trade of your home and were bought and sold like ani other vendibl
thing your peopl dealt in
oh not that cri emili sai anyth of me but dont visit
my disgrac and shame more than i have done on folk who ar as
honour as you have some respect for them as you ar a ladi if you

draw awai her dress from the contamin of emili touch i speak
of hi homewher i live here she said stretch out her hand with
her contemptu laugh and look down upon the prostrat girl is a
worthi caus of divis between ladymoth and gentlemanson of grief
in a hous where she wouldnt have been admit as a kitchengirl of
anger and repin and reproach thi piec of pollut pick up
from the watersid to be made much of for an hour and then toss
back to her origin place
no no cri emili clasp her hand togeth when he first came
into my waythat the dai had never dawn upon me and he had met me

dont defend myself but i know well and he know well or he will know
when he come to die and hi mind is troubl with it that he us all

rosa dartl sprang up from her seat recoil and in recoil struck
at her with a face of such malign so darken and disfigur by
passion that i had almost thrown myself between them the blow which
had no aim fell upon the air as she now stood pant look at
her with the utmost detest that she wa capabl of express and
trembl from head to foot with rage and scorn i thought i had never
seen such a sight and never could see such anoth

it onli want a weapon to stab the object of her wrath
emili had shrunk out of my view there wa no repli
and tell that to me she ad with your shame lip why dont
thei whip these creatur if i could order it to be done i would have
thi girl whip to death
and so she would i have no doubt i would not have trust her with the
rack itself while that furiou look last she slowli veri slowli
broke into a laugh and point at emili with her hand as if she were a
sight of shame for god and men
she love she said that carrion and he ever care for her shed
tell me ha ha the liar that these trader ar

you hold your tongu mother he return least said soonest

though i had long known that hi servil wa fals and all hi

extent of hi hypocrisi until i now saw him with hi mask off the
sudden with which he drop it when he perceiv that it wa
useless to him the malic insol and hatr he reveal the leer
with which he exult even at thi moment in the evil he had doneal
thi time be desper too and at hi wit end for the mean
of get the better of usthough perfectli consist with the

known him so long and dislik him so heartili
i sai noth of the look he confer on me as he stood ey us
on after anoth for i had alwai understood that he hate me and i
rememb the mark of my hand upon hi cheek but when hi ey pass
on to agn and i saw the rage with which he felt hi power over her
slip awai and the exhibit in their disappoint of the
odiou passion that had led him to aspir to on whose virtu he could
never appreci or care for i wa shock by the mere thought of her
have live an hour within sight of such a man
after some rub of the lower part of hi face and some look at us
with those bad ey over hi grisli finger he made on more address
to me half whine and half abus
you think it justifi do you copperfield you who pride yourself
so much on your honour and all the rest of it to sneak about my place
eavesdrop with my clerk if it had been me i shouldnt have
wonder for i dont make myself out a gentleman though i never wa

feet twist round the other leg wait doggedli for what might
follow
mr micawb whose impetuos i had restrain thu far with the
greatest difficulti and who had repeatedli interpos with the first
syllabl of scoundrel without get to the second now burst
forward drew the ruler from hi breast appar as a defens
weapon and produc from hi pocket a foolscap document fold in the
form of a larg letter open thi packet with hi old flourish and
glanc at the content as if he cherish an artist admir of

ever been the sport and toi of debas circumst ignomini
want despair and mad have collect or separ been the

the relish with which mr micawb describ himself as a prei to these
dismal calam wa onli to be equal by the emphasi with which he
read hi letter and the kind of homag he render to it with a roll of
hi head when he thought he had hit a sentenc veri hard inde

when thei come to sever good word in success for the express
of on idea as that thei utterli detest abomin and abjur or so
forth and the old anathema were made relish on the same principl
we talk about the tyranni of word but we like to tyrann over them
too we ar fond of have a larg superflu establish of word to
wait upon us on great occas we think it look import and sound
well as we ar not particular about the mean of our liveri on
state occas if thei be but fine and numer enough so the
mean or necess of our word is a secondari consider if there
be but a great parad of them and as individu get into troubl by
make too great a show of liveri or as slave when thei ar too
numer rise against their master so i think i could mention a
nation that ha got into mani great difficulti and will get into mani
greater from maintain too larg a retinu of word
mr micawb read on almost smack hi lip

contempl of that affect spectacl
the veil that ha long been interpos between mr micawb and

prospect which appear to the best of my judgement to be anyth
but welcom to them and call upon them to come out into canterburi
and sing a choru as noth els wa left for their support
but mr micawb have in the strength of her emot faint awai
the first thing to be done even befor the choru could be consid

sort but would there be a reason open for hi talent to

for a man who conduct himself well repeat mr micawb with her
clearest busi manner and is industri precis it is

look on to fortun or how mr micawb present discours
about the habit of the kangaroo shall i ever recal that street of
canterburi on a marketdai without recal him as he walk
back with us express in the hardi rove manner he assum the
unsettl habit of a temporari sojourn in the land and look at

chapter 54 mr micawb transact
thi is not the time at which i am to enter on the state of my mind
beneath it load of sorrow i came to think that the futur wa wall
up befor me that the energi and action of my life were at an end that
i never could find ani refug but in the grave i came to think so i
sai but not in the first shock of my grief it slowli grew to that
if the event i go on to relat had not thicken around me in the
begin to confus and in the end to augment my afflict it is
possibl though i think not probabl that i might have fallen at onc
into thi condit as it wa an interv occur befor i fulli knew
my own distress an interv in which i even suppos that it sharpest
pang were past and when my mind could sooth itself by rest on
all that wa most innoc and beauti in the tender stori that wa
close for ever
when it wa first propos that i should go abroad or how it came to be
agre among us that i wa to seek the restor of my peac in chang
and travel i do not even now distinctli know the spirit of agn so
pervad all we thought and said and did in that time of sorrow that
i assum i mai refer the project to her influenc but her influenc wa
so quiet that i know no more
and now inde i began to think that in my old associ of her with
the stainedglass window in the church a prophet foreshadow of
what she would be to me in the calam that wa to happen in the
full of time had found a wai into my mind in all that sorrow from
the moment never to be forgotten when she stood befor me with her
uprais hand she wa like a sacr presenc in my lone hous when
the angel of death alight there my childwif fell asleepthei told
me so when i could bear to hear iton her bosom with a smile from my
swoon i first awok to a conscious of her compassion tear her
word of hope and peac her gentl face bend down as from a purer
region nearer heaven over my undisciplin heart and soften it
pain
let me go on
i wa to go abroad that seem to have been determin among us from
the first the ground now cover all that could perish of my
depart wife i wait onli for what mr micawb call the final
pulver of heep and for the departur of the emigr

fell back on me i suppos from old habit to whomsoev els she might
address her discours at start that the time is come when the past
should be buri in oblivion when my famili should take mr micawb by
the hand and mr micawb should take my famili by the hand when the
lion should lie down with the lamb and my famili be on term with mr
micawb
i said i thought so too
thi at least is the light my dear mr copperfield pursu mr
micawb in which i view the subject when i live at home with my
papa and mama my papa wa accustom to ask when ani point wa under
discuss in our limit circl in what light doe my emma view the
subject that my papa wa too partial i know still on such a point
as the frigid cold which ha ever subsist between mr micawb and
my famili i necessarili have form an opinion delus though it mai
be
no doubt of cours you have maam said my aunt
precis so assent mr micawb now i mai be wrong in my
conclus it is veri like that i am but my individu impress
is that the gulf between my famili and mr micawb mai be trace to an
apprehens on the part of my famili that mr micawb would requir
pecuniari accommod i cannot help think said mr micawb
with an air of deep sagac that there ar member of my famili who
have been apprehens that mr micawb would solicit them for their
namesi do not mean to be confer in baptism upon our children
but to be inscrib on bill of exchang and negoti in the monei
market
the look of penetr with which mr micawb announc thi
discoveri as if no on had ever thought of it befor seem rather to
astonish my aunt who abruptli repli well maam upon the whole i
shouldnt wonder if you were right
mr micawb be now on the ev of cast off the pecuniari
shackl that have so long enthral him said mr micawb and of
commenc a new career in a countri where there is suffici rang
for hi abilitieswhich in my opinion is exceedingli import mr
micawb abil peculiarli requir spaceit seem to me that
my famili should signal the occas by come forward what i could
wish to see would be a meet between mr micawb and my famili at
a festiv entertain to be given at my famili expens where mr
micawb health and prosper be propos by some lead member
of my famili mr micawb might have an opportun of develop hi
view
my dear said mr micawb with some heat it mai be better for me
to state distinctli at onc that if i were to develop my view to that
assembl group thei would possibl be found of an offens natur
my impress be that your famili ar in the aggreg impertin
snob and in detail unmitig ruffian
micawb said mr micawb shake her head no you have never
understood them and thei have never understood you
mr micawb cough
thei have never understood you micawb said hi wife thei mai
be incap of it if so that is their misfortun i can piti their
misfortun
i am extrem sorri my dear emma said mr micawb relent to
have been betrai into ani express that might even remot have
the appear of be strong express all i would sai is that
i can go abroad without your famili come forward to favour mein
short with a part shove of their cold shoulder and that upon the
whole i would rather leav england with such impetu as i possess than
deriv ani acceler of it from that quarter at the same time my
dear if thei should condescend to repli to your communicationswhich
our joint experi render most improbablefar be it from me to be a
barrier to your wish
the matter be thu amic settl mr micawb gave mr micawb
hi arm and glanc at the heap of book and paper ly befor
traddl on the tabl said thei would leav us to ourselv which thei
ceremoni did
my dear copperfield said traddl lean back in hi chair when
thei were gone and look at me with an affect that made hi ey
red and hi hair all kind of shape i dont make ani excus for
troubl you with busi becaus i know you ar deepli interest
in it and it mai divert your thought my dear boi i hope you ar not
worn out
i am quit myself said i after a paus we have more caus to think
of my aunt than of anyon you know how much she ha done
sure sure answer traddl who can forget it
but even that is not all said i dure the last fortnight some new
troubl ha vex her and she ha been in and out of london everi dai
sever time she ha gone out earli and been absent until even
last night traddl with thi journei befor her it wa almost
midnight befor she came home you know what her consider for
other is she will not tell me what ha happen to distress her
my aunt veri pale and with deep line in her face sat immov until
i had finish when some strai tear found their wai to her cheek and
she put her hand on mine
it noth trot it noth there will be no more of it you
shall know by and by now agn my dear let us attend to these
affair
i must do mr micawb the justic to sai traddl began that
although he would appear not to have work to ani good account for
himself he is a most untir man when he work for other peopl i
never saw such a fellow if he alwai goe on in the same wai he must
be virtual about two hundr year old at present the heat into
which he ha been continu put himself and the distract and
impetu manner in which he ha been dive dai and night among
paper and book to sai noth of the immens number of letter he ha
written me between thi hous and mr wickfield and often across the
tabl when he ha been sit opposit and might much more easili have
spoken is quit extraordinari
letter cri my aunt i believ he dream in letter
there mr dick too said traddl ha been do wonder as soon
as he wa releas from overlook uriah heep whom he kept in such
charg as i never saw exceed he began to devot himself to mr
wickfield and realli hi anxieti to be of us in the investig we
have been make and hi real us in extract and copi
and fetch and carri have been quit stimul to us
dick is a veri remark man exclaim my aunt and i alwai said
he wa trot you know it
i am happi to sai miss wickfield pursu traddl at onc with
great delicaci and with great earnest that in your absenc mr
wickfield ha consider improv reliev of the incubu that had
fasten upon him for so long a time and of the dread apprehens
under which he had live he is hardli the same person at time
even hi impair power of concentr hi memori and attent on
particular point of busi ha recov itself veri much and he
ha been abl to assist us in make some thing clear that we should
have found veri difficult inde if not hopeless without him but
what i have to do is to come to result which ar short enough not
to gossip on all the hope circumst i have observ or i shall
never have done hi natur manner and agreeabl simplic made it
transpar that he said thi to put us in good heart and to enabl
agn to hear her father mention with greater confid but it wa
not the less pleasant for that
now let me see said traddl look among the paper on the
tabl have count our fund and reduc to order a great mass of
unintent confus in the first place and of wil confus and
falsif in the second we take it to be clear that mr wickfield
might now wind up hi busi and hi agencytrust and exhibit no
defici or defalc whatev
oh thank heaven cri agn fervent
but said traddl the surplu that would be left as hi mean of
supportand i suppos the hous to be sold even in sai thiswould
be so small not exceed in all probabl some hundr of pound
that perhap miss wickfield it would be best to consid whether he
might not retain hi agenc of the estat to which he ha so long been
receiv hi friend might advis him you know now he is free you
yourself miss wickfieldcopperfieldi
i have consid it trotwood said agn look to me and i feel
that it ought not to be and must not be even on the recommend of
a friend to whom i am so grate and ow so much
i will not sai that i recommend it observ traddl i think it
right to suggest it no more
i am happi to hear you sai so answer agn steadili for it give
me hope almost assur that we think alik dear mr traddl and
dear trotwood papa onc free with honour what could i wish for i have
alwai aspir if i could have releas him from the toil in which he
wa held to render back some littl portion of the love and care i ow
him and to devot my life to him it ha been for year the utmost
height of my hope to take our futur on myself will be the next
great happinessth next to hi releas from all trust and
responsibilitythat i can know
have you thought how agn
often i am not afraid dear trotwood i am certain of success so mani
peopl know me here and think kindli of me that i am certain dont
mistrust me our want ar not mani if i rent the dear old hous and
keep a school i shall be us and happi
the calm fervour of her cheer voic brought back so vividli first
the dear old hous itself and then my solitari home that my heart wa
too full for speech traddl pretend for a littl while to be busili
look among the paper
next miss trotwood said traddl that properti of your
well sir sigh my aunt all i have got to sai about it is that if
it gone i can bear it and if it not gone i shall be glad to get
it back
it wa origin i think eight thousand pound consol said
traddl
right repli my aunt
i cant account for more than five said traddl with an air of
perplex
thousand do you mean inquir my aunt with uncommon composur
or pound
five thousand pound said traddl
it wa all there wa return my aunt i sold three myself on i
paid for your articl trot my dear and the other two i have by me
when i lost the rest i thought it wise to sai noth about that sum
but to keep it secretli for a raini dai i want to see how you would
come out of the trial trot and you came out noblypersev
selfreli selfdeni so did dick dont speak to me for i find
my nerv a littl shaken
nobodi would have thought so to see her sit upright with her arm
fold but she had wonder selfcommand
then i am delight to sai cri traddl beam with joi that we
have recov the whole monei
dont congratul me anybodi exclaim my aunt how so sir
you believ it had been misappropri by mr wickfield said
traddl
of cours i did said my aunt and wa therefor easili silenc
agn not a word
and inde said traddl it wa sold by virtu of the power of
manag he held from you but i neednt sai by whom sold or on whose
actual signatur it wa afterward pretend to mr wickfield by that
rascaland prove too by figuresthat he had possess himself of
the monei on gener instruct he said to keep other defici
and difficulti from the light mr wickfield be so weak and
helpless in hi hand as to pai you afterward sever sum of
interest on a pretend princip which he knew did not exist made
himself unhappili a parti to the fraud
and at last took the blame upon himself ad my aunt and wrote me
a mad letter charg himself with robberi and wrong unheard of upon
which i paid him a visit earli on morn call for a candl burnt
the letter and told him if he ever could right me and himself to
do it and if he couldnt to keep hi own counsel for hi daughter
sakeif anybodi speak to me ill leav the hous
we all remain quiet agn cover her face
well my dear friend said my aunt after a paus and you have
realli extort the monei back from him
why the fact is return traddl mr micawb had so complet
hem him in and wa alwai readi with so mani new point if an
old on fail that he could not escap from us a most remark
circumst is that i realli dont think he grasp thi sum even so
much for the gratif of hi avaric which wa inordin as in
the hatr he felt for copperfield he said so to me plainli he said
he would even have spent as much to baulk or injur copperfield
ha said my aunt knit her brow thoughtfulli and glanc at
agn and what becom of him
i dont know he left here said traddl with hi mother who had
been clamour and beseech and disclos the whole time thei
went awai by on of the london night coach and i know no more about
him except that hi malevol to me at part wa audaci he
seem to consid himself hardli less indebt to me than to mr
micawb which i consid as i told him quit a compliment
do you suppos he ha ani monei traddl i ask
oh dear ye i should think so he repli shake hi head
serious i should sai he must have pocket a good deal in on
wai or other but i think you would find copperfield if you had an
opportun of observ hi cours that monei would never keep that
man out of mischief he is such an incarn hypocrit that whatev
object he pursu he must pursu crookedli it hi onli compens
for the outward restraint he put upon himself alwai creep along
the ground to some small end or other he will alwai magnifi everi
object in the wai and consequ will hate and suspect everybodi that
come in the most innoc manner between him and it so the crook
cours will becom crooked at ani moment for the least reason
or for none it onli necessari to consid hi histori here said
traddl to know that
he a monster of mean said my aunt
realli i dont know about that observ traddl thoughtfulli mani
peopl can be veri mean when thei give their mind to it
and now touch mr micawb said my aunt
well realli said traddl cheerfulli i must onc more give mr
micawb high prais but for hi have been so patient and persev
for so long a time we never could have hope to do anyth worth
speak of and i think we ought to consid that mr micawb did
right for right sake when we reflect what term he might have made
with uriah heep himself for hi silenc
i think so too said i
now what would you give him inquir my aunt
oh befor you come to that said traddl a littl disconcert
i am afraid i thought it discreet to omit not be abl to carri
everyth befor me two point in make thi lawless adjustmentfor
it perfectli lawless from begin to endof a difficult affair
those iou and so forth which mr micawb gave him for the
advanc he had
well thei must be paid said my aunt
ye but i dont know when thei mai be proceed on or where thei
ar rejoin traddl open hi ey and i anticip that
between thi time and hi departur mr micawb will be constantli
arrest or taken in execut
then he must be constantli set free again and taken out of execut
said my aunt what the amount altogeth
why mr micawb ha enter the transactionsh call them
transactionswith great form in a book rejoin traddl smile
and he make the amount a hundr and three pound five
now what shall we give him that sum includ said my aunt agn
my dear you and i can talk about divis of it afterward what should
it be five hundr pound
upon thi traddl and i both struck in at onc we both recommend
a small sum in monei and the payment without stipul to mr
micawb of the uriah claim as thei came in we propos that the
famili should have their passag and their outfit and a hundr pound
and that mr micawb arrang for the repay of the advanc
should be grave enter into as it might be wholesom for him
to suppos himself under that respons to thi i ad the
suggest that i should give some explan of hi charact and
histori to mr peggotti who i knew could be reli on and that to mr
peggotti should be quietli entrust the discret of advanc anoth
hundr i further propos to interest mr micawb in mr peggotti
by confid so much of mr peggotti stori to him as i might feel
justifi in relat or might think expedi and to endeavour to
bring each of them to bear upon the other for the common advantag we
all enter warmli into these view and i mai mention at onc that the
princip themselv did so shortli afterward with perfect good will
and harmoni
see that traddl now glanc anxious at my aunt again i remind
him of the second and last point to which he had advert
you and your aunt will excus me copperfield if i touch upon a
pain theme as i greatli fear i shall said traddl hesit
but i think it necessari to bring it to your recollect on the dai
of mr micawb memor denunci a threaten allus wa made
by uriah heep to your auntshusband

vicissitud
dont you think that i ask the coachman in the first stage out of
london a veri remark sky i dont rememb to have seen on like

nor inot equal to it he repli that wind sir therel be
mischief done at sea i expect befor long
it wa a murki confusionher and there blot with a colour like the
colour of the smoke from damp fuelof fly cloud toss up into
most remark heap suggest greater height in the cloud than
there were depth below them to the bottom of the deepest hollow in the
earth through which the wild moon seem to plung headlong as if in
a dread disturb of the law of natur she had lost her wai and were
frighten there had been a wind all dai and it wa rise then with
an extraordinari great sound in anoth hour it had much increas and
the sky wa more overcast and blew hard
but as the night advanc the cloud close in and dens
overspread the whole sky then veri dark it came on to blow harder
and harder it still increas until our hors could scarc face
the wind mani time in the dark part of the night it wa then late in
septemb when the night were not short the leader turn about or
came to a dead stop and we were often in seriou apprehens that the
coach would be blown over sweep gust of rain came up befor thi
storm like shower of steel and at those time when there wa ani
shelter of tree or lee wall to be got we were fain to stop in a
sheer imposs of continu the struggl
when the dai broke it blew harder and harder i had been in yarmouth
when the seamen said it blew great gun but i had never known the like
of thi or anyth approach to it we came to ipswichveri late
have had to fight everi inch of ground sinc we were ten mile out of
london and found a cluster of peopl in the marketplac who had
risen from their bed in the night fear of fall chimnei some of
these congreg about the innyard while we chang hors told us
of great sheet of lead have been rip off a high churchtow and
flung into a bystreet which thei then block up other had to tell
of countri peopl come in from neighbour villag who had seen
great tree ly torn out of the earth and whole rick scatter about
the road and field still there wa no abat in the storm but it
blew harder
as we struggl on nearer and nearer to the sea from which thi mighti
wind wa blow dead on shore it forc becam more and more terrif
long befor we saw the sea it sprai wa on our lip and shower
salt rain upon us the water wa out over mile and mile of the flat
countri adjac to yarmouth and everi sheet and puddl lash it
bank and had it stress of littl breaker set heavili toward us
when we came within sight of the sea the wave on the horizon caught
at interv abov the roll abyss were like glimps of anoth
shore with tower and build when at last we got into the town the
peopl came out to their door all aslant and with stream hair
make a wonder of the mail that had come through such a night
i put up at the old inn and went down to look at the sea stagger
along the street which wa strewn with sand and seawe and with
fly blotch of seafoam afraid of fall slate and tile and
hold by peopl i met at angri corner come near the beach i saw

that coasthad brought togeth i made my wai to hi hous it wa
shut and as no on answer to my knock i went by back wai and
bylan to the yard where he work i learn there that he had
gone to lowestoft to meet some sudden exig of shiprepair
in which hi skill wa requir but that he would be back tomorrow
morn in good time
i went back to the inn and when i had wash and dress and tri to
sleep but in vain it wa five oclock in the afternoon i had not sat
five minut by the coffeeroom fire when the waiter come to stir
it as an excus for talk told me that two collier had gone down
with all hand a few mile awai and that some other ship had been
seen labour hard in the road and try in great distress to keep
off shore merci on them and on all poor sailor said he if we had
anoth night like the last
i wa veri much depress in spirit veri solitari and felt an
uneasi in ham not be there disproportion to the occas i
wa serious affect without know how much by late event and my
long exposur to the fierc wind had confus me there wa that jumbl
in my thought and recollect that i had lost the clear arrang
of time and distanc thu if i had gone out into the town i should
not have been surpris i think to encount someon who i knew must
be then in london so to speak there wa in these respect a curiou
inattent in my mind yet it wa busi too with all the remembr
the place natur awaken and thei were particularli distinct and
vivid
in thi state the waiter dismal intellig about the ship
immedi connect itself without ani effort of my volit with my
uneasi about ham i wa persuad that i had an apprehens of hi
return from lowestoft by sea and be lost thi grew so strong
with me that i resolv to go back to the yard befor i took my dinner
and ask the boatbuild if he thought hi attempt to return by sea
at all like if he gave me the least reason to think so i would go
over to lowestoft and prevent it by bring him with me
i hastili order my dinner and went back to the yard i wa none too
soon for the boatbuild with a lantern in hi hand wa lock
the yardgat he quit laugh when i ask him the question and said
there wa no fear no man in hi sens or out of them would put off
in such a gale of wind least of all ham peggotti who had been born to
seafar
so sensibl of thi beforehand that i had realli felt asham of do
what i wa nevertheless impel to do i went back to the inn if
such a wind could rise i think it wa rise the howl and roar the
rattl of the door and window the rumbl in the chimnei the
appar rock of the veri hous that shelter me and the prodigi
tumult of the sea were more fear than in the morn but there
wa now a great dark besid and that invest the storm with new
terror real and fanci
i could not eat i could not sit still i could not continu steadfast
to anyth someth within me faintli answer to the storm
without toss up the depth of my memori and made a tumult in them
yet in all the hurri of my thought wild run with the thunder
seath storm and my uneasi regard ham were alwai in the
foreground
my dinner went awai almost untast and i tri to refresh myself with
a glass or two of wine in vain i fell into a dull slumber befor
the fire without lose my conscious either of the uproar out of
door or of the place in which i wa both becam overshadow by a new
and indefin horror and when i awokeor rather when i shook off
the lethargi that bound me in my chairmi whole frame thrill with
objectless and unintellig fear
i walk to and fro tri to read an old gazett listen to the
aw nois look at face scene and figur in the fire
at length the steadi tick of the undisturb clock on the wall
torment me to that degre that i resolv to go to bed
it wa reassur on such a night to be told that some of the
innserv had agre togeth to sit up until morn i went to bed
exceedingli weari and heavi but on my ly down all such sensat
vanish as if by magic and i wa broad awak with everi sens
refin
for hour i lai there listen to the wind and water imagin now
that i heard shriek out at sea now that i distinctli heard the fire
of signal gun and now the fall of hous in the town i got up
sever time and look out but could see noth except the
reflect in the windowpan of the faint candl i had left burn
and of my own haggard face look in at me from the black void
at length my restless attain to such a pitch that i hurri on
my cloth and went downstair in the larg kitchen where i dimli
saw bacon and rope of onion hang from the beam the watcher were
cluster togeth in variou attitud about a tabl purpos move
awai from the great chimnei and brought near the door a pretti girl
who had her ear stop with her apron and her ey upon the door
scream when i appear suppos me to be a spirit but the other
had more presenc of mind and were glad of an addit to their
compani on man refer to the topic thei had been discuss ask
me whether i thought the soul of the colliercrew who had gone down
were out in the storm
i remain there i dare sai two hour onc i open the yardgat
and look into the empti street the sand the seawe and the flake
of foam were drive by and i wa oblig to call for assist
befor i could shut the gate again and make it fast against the wind
there wa a dark gloom in my solitari chamber when i at length return
to it but i wa tire now and get into bed again felloff
a tower and down a precipiceinto the depth of sleep i have an
impress that for a long time though i dream of be elsewher and
in a varieti of scene it wa alwai blow in my dream at length
i lost that feebl hold upon realiti and wa engag with two dear
friend but who thei were i dont know at the sieg of some town in a
roar of cannonad
the thunder of the cannon wa so loud and incess that i could not
hear someth i much desir to hear until i made a great exert
and awok it wa broad dayeight or nine oclock the storm rage in
lieu of the batteri and someon knock and call at my door
what is the matter i cri
a wreck close by
i sprung out of bed and ask what wreck
a schooner from spain or portug laden with fruit and wine make
hast sir if you want to see her it thought down on the beach
shell go to piec everi moment
the excit voic went clamour along the staircas and i wrap
myself in my cloth as quickli as i could and ran into the street
number of peopl were there befor me all run in on direct to
the beach i ran the same wai outstrip a good mani and soon came
face the wild sea
the wind might by thi time have lull a littl though not more
sensibl than if the cannonad i had dream of had been diminish
by the silenc of halfadozen gun out of hundr but the sea
have upon it the addit agit of the whole night wa
infinit more terrif than when i had seen it last everi appear
it had then present bore the express of be swell and the
height to which the breaker rose and look over on anoth
bore on anoth down and roll in in intermin host wa most
appal in the difficulti of hear anyth but wind and wave
and in the crowd and the unspeak confus and my first breathless
effort to stand against the weather i wa so confus that i look
out to sea for the wreck and saw noth but the foam head of the
great wave a halfdress boatman stand next me point with hi
bare arm a tattood arrow on it point in the same direct to the
left then o great heaven i saw it close in upon us
on mast wa broken short off six or eight feet from the deck and lai
over the side entangl in a maze of sail and rig and all that
ruin as the ship roll and beatwhich she did without a moment
paus and with a violenc quit inconceivablebeat the side as if it
would stave it in some effort were even then be made to cut thi
portion of the wreck awai for as the ship which wa broadsid on
turn toward us in her roll i plainli descri her peopl at
work with ax especi on activ figur with long curl hair
conspicu among the rest but a great cry which wa audibl even
abov the wind and water rose from the shore at thi moment the sea
sweep over the roll wreck made a clean breach and carri men
spar cask plank bulwark heap of such toi into the boil
surg
the second mast wa yet stand with the rag of a rent sail and
a wild confus of broken cordag flap to and fro the ship had
struck onc the same boatman hoars said in my ear and then lift
in and struck again i understood him to add that she wa part
amidship and i could readili suppos so for the roll and beat
were too tremend for ani human work to suffer long as he spoke
there wa anoth great cry of piti from the beach four men aros with
the wreck out of the deep cling to the rig of the remain
mast uppermost the activ figur with the curl hair
there wa a bell on board and as the ship roll and dash like a
desper creatur driven mad now show us the whole sweep of her
deck as she turn on her beamend toward the shore now noth but
her keel as she sprung wildli over and turn toward the sea the bell
rang and it sound the knell of those unhappi men wa born toward
us on the wind again we lost her and again she rose two men were
gone the agoni on the shore increas men groan and clasp their
hand women shriek and turn awai their face some ran wildli
up and down along the beach cry for help where no help could be i
found myself on of these frantic implor a knot of sailor whom
i knew not to let those two lost creatur perish befor our ey
thei were make out to me in an agit wayi dont know how
for the littl i could hear i wa scarc compos enough to
understandthat the lifeboat had been brave man an hour ago and
could do noth and that as no man would be so desper as to attempt
to wade off with a rope and establish a commun with the shore
there wa noth left to try when i notic that some new sensat
move the peopl on the beach and saw them part and ham come break
through them to the front
i ran to hima well as i know to repeat my appeal for help but
distract though i wa by a sight so new to me and terribl the
determin in hi face and hi look out to seaexactli the same
look as i rememb in connexion with the morn after emili
flightawok me to a knowledg of hi danger i held him back with both
arm and implor the men with whom i had been speak not to listen
to him not to do murder not to let him stir from off that sand
anoth cry aros on shore and look to the wreck we saw the cruel
sail with blow on blow beat off the lower of the two men and fly up
in triumph round the activ figur left alon upon the mast
against such a sight and against such determin as that of the
calmli desper man who wa alreadi accustom to lead half the peopl
present i might as hopefulli have entreat the wind masr davi
he said cheerili grasp me by both hand if my time is come ti
come if tant ill bide it lord abov bless you and bless all
mate make me readi im ago off
i wa swept awai but not unkindli to some distanc where the peopl
around me made me stai urg as i confusedli perceiv that he wa
bent on go with help or without and that i should endang the
precaut for hi safeti by troubl those with whom thei rest i
dont know what i answer or what thei rejoin but i saw hurri on
the beach and men run with rope from a capstan that wa there and
penetr into a circl of figur that hid him from me then i saw
him stand alon in a seaman frock and trouser a rope in hi
hand or slung to hi wrist anoth round hi bodi and sever of the
best men hold at a littl distanc to the latter which he laid out
himself slack upon the shore at hi feet
the wreck even to my unpractis ey wa break up i saw that she
wa part in the middl and that the life of the solitari man upon
the mast hung by a thread still he clung to it he had a singular red
cap onnot like a sailor cap but of a finer colour and as the few
yield plank between him and destruct roll and bulg and hi
anticip deathknel rung he wa seen by all of us to wave it i
saw him do it now and thought i wa go distract when hi action
brought an old remembr to my mind of a onc dear friend
ham watch the sea stand alon with the silenc of suspend
breath behind him and the storm befor until there wa a great
retir wave when with a backward glanc at those who held the rope
which wa made fast round hi bodi he dash in after it and in a
moment wa buffet with the water rise with the hill fall
with the vallei lost beneath the foam then drawn again to land thei
haul in hastili
he wa hurt i saw blood on hi face from where i stood but he took
no thought of that he seem hurriedli to give them some direct for
leav him more freeor so i judg from the motion of hi armand
wa gone as befor
and now he made for the wreck rise with the hill fall with the
vallei lost beneath the rug foam born in toward the shore
born on toward the ship strive hard and valiantli the distanc wa
noth but the power of the sea and wind made the strife deadli at
length he near the wreck he wa so near that with on more of hi
vigor stroke he would be cling to itwhen a high green vast
hillsid of water move on shoreward from beyond the ship he seem
to leap up into it with a mighti bound and the ship wa gone
some eddi fragment i saw in the sea as if a mere cask had been
broken in run to the spot where thei were haul in constern
wa in everi face thei drew him to my veri feetinsensibledead
he wa carri to the nearest hous and no on prevent me now i
remain near him busi while everi mean of restor were tri
but he had been beaten to death by the great wave and hi gener
heart wa still for ever
as i sat besid the bed when hope wa abandon and all wa done a
fisherman who had known me when emili and i were children and ever
sinc whisper my name at the door
sir said he with tear start to hi weatherbeaten face which
with hi trembl lip wa ashi pale will you come over yonder
the old remembr that had been recal to me wa in hi look i
ask him terrorstricken lean on the arm he held out to support
me
ha a bodi come ashor
he said ye
do i know it i ask then
he answer noth
but he led me to the shore and on that part of it where she and i had
look for shell two childrenon that part of it where some lighter
fragment of the old boat blown down last night had been scatter by
the windamong the ruin of the home he had wrongedi saw him ly
with hi head upon hi arm as i had often seen him lie at school
chapter 56 the new wound and the old
no need o steerforth to have said when we last spoke togeth in
that hour which i so littl deem to be our partinghourno need to
have said think of me at my best i had done that ever and could i
chang now look on thi sight
thei brought a handbier and laid him on it and cover him with a
flag and took him up and bore him on toward the hous all the men
who carri him had known him and gone sail with him and seen him
merri and bold thei carri him through the wild roar a hush in the
midst of all the tumult and took him to the cottag where death wa
alreadi
but when thei set the bier down on the threshold thei look at on
anoth and at me and whisper i knew why thei felt as if it were
not right to lai him down in the same quiet room
we went into the town and took our burden to the inn so soon as i
could at all collect my thought i sent for joram and beg him to
provid me a convey in which it could be got to london in the night
i knew that the care of it and the hard duti of prepar hi mother to
receiv it could onli rest with me and i wa anxiou to discharg that
duti as faithfulli as i could
i chose the night for the journei that there might be less curios
when i left the town but although it wa nearli midnight when i came
out of the yard in a chais follow by what i had in charg there
were mani peopl wait at interv along the town and even a
littl wai out upon the road i saw more but at length onli the bleak
night and the open countri were around me and the ash of my youth
friendship
upon a mellow autumn dai about noon when the ground wa perfum by
fallen leav and mani more in beauti tint of yellow red and
brown yet hung upon the tree through which the sun wa shine i
arriv at highgat i walk the last mile think as i went along of
what i had to do and left the carriag that had follow me all through
the night await order to advanc

noth move
i had not at first the courag to ring at the gate and when i did
ring my errand seem to me to be express in the veri sound of the
bell the littl parlourmaid came out with the kei in her hand and
look earnestli at me as she unlock the gate said

wa an invalid and could not come down but that if i would excus her
be in her chamber she would be glad to see me in a few moment i
stood befor her
she wa in hi room not in her own i felt of cours that she had
taken to occupi it in remembr of him and that the mani token

remain there just as he had left them for the same reason she
murmur howev even in her recept of me that she wa out of her

quickli but i had seen rosa dartl throw her hand up in the air with
vehem of despair and horror and then clasp them on her face
the handsom ladyso like oh so likeregard me with a fix look
and put her hand to her forehead i besought her to be calm and prepar
herself to bear what i had to tell but i should rather have entreat

micawb the ocean in these time is a perfect fleet of ship and
we can hardli fail to encount mani in run over it is mere
cross said mr micawb trifl with hi eyeglass mere
cross the distanc is quit imaginari
i think now how odd it wa but how wonderfulli like mr micawb
that when he went from london to canterburi he should have talk as
if he were go to the farthest limit of the earth and when he went
from england to australia as if he were go for a littl trip across
the channel
on the voyag i shall endeavour said mr micawb occasion

improprietysh will give them i dare sai littl tafflin porpois
and dolphin i believ will be frequent observ athwart our
bow and either on the starboard or the larboard quarter object of
interest will be continu descri in short said mr micawb
with the old genteel air the probabl is all will be found so
excit alow and aloft that when the lookout station in the
maintop cri landoh we shall be veri consider astonish
with that he flourish off the content of hi littl tin pot as if he
had made the voyag and had pass a firstclass examin befor the
highest naval author
what i chiefli hope my dear mr copperfield said mr micawb
is that in some branch of our famili we mai live again in the old
countri do not frown micawb i do not now refer to my own famili
but to our children children howev vigor the sapl said mr
micawb shake her head i cannot forget the parenttre and when
our race attain to emin and fortun i own i should wish that
fortun to flow into the coffer of britannia
my dear said mr micawb britannia must take her chanc i am
bound to sai that she ha never done much for me and that i have no
particular wish upon the subject
micawb return mr micawb there you ar wrong you ar go
out micawb to thi distant clime to strengthen not to weaken the
connexion between yourself and albion
the connexion in question my love rejoin mr micawb ha not
laid me i repeat under that load of person oblig that i am at
all sensit as to the format of anoth connexion
micawb return mr micawb there i again sai you ar wrong
you do not know your power micawb it is that which will strengthen
even in thi step you ar about to take the connexion between yourself
and albion
mr micawb sat in hi elbowchair with hi eyebrow rais half
receiv and half repudi mr micawb view as thei were
state but veri sensibl of their foresight
my dear mr copperfield said mr micawb i wish mr micawb to
feel hi posit it appear to me highli import that mr micawb
should from the hour of hi embark feel hi posit your old
knowledg of me my dear mr copperfield will have told you that i have
not the sanguin disposit of mr micawb my disposit is if i
mai sai so emin practic i know that thi is a long voyag i
know that it will involv mani privat and inconveni i cannot
shut my ey to those fact but i also know what mr micawb is
i know the latent power of mr micawb and therefor i consid it
vital import that mr micawb should feel hi posit
my love he observ perhap you will allow me to remark that it is
bare possibl that i do feel my posit at the present moment
i think not micawb she rejoin not fulli my dear mr
copperfield mr micawb is not a common case mr micawb is go
to a distant countri expressli in order that he mai be fulli understood
and appreci for the first time i wish mr micawb to take hi
stand upon that vessel prow and firmli sai thi countri i am
come to conquer have you honour have you rich have you post of
profit pecuniari emolu let them be brought forward thei ar
mine
mr micawb glanc at us all seem to think there wa a good deal
in thi idea
i wish mr micawb if i make myself understood said mr micawb
in her argument tone to be the caesar of hi own fortun that
my dear mr copperfield appear to me to be hi true posit from
the first moment of thi voyag i wish mr micawb to stand upon
that vessel prow and sai enough of delai enough of disappoint
enough of limit mean that wa in the old countri thi is the new
produc your repar bring it forward
mr micawb fold hi arm in a resolut manner as if he were then
station on the figurehead
and do that said mr micawb feel hi positionam i not
right in sai that mr micawb will strengthen and not weaken hi
connexion with britain an import public charact aris in that
hemispher shall i be told that it influenc will not be felt at home
can i be so weak as to imagin that mr micawb wield the rod of
talent and of power in australia will be noth in england i am but
a woman but i should be unworthi of myself and of my papa if i were
guilti of such absurd weak
mr micawb convict that her argument were unanswer gave
a moral elev to her tone which i think i had never heard in it
befor
and therefor it is said mr micawb that i the more wish that
at a futur period we mai live again on the parent soil mr micawb
mai bei cannot disguis from myself that the probabl is mr
micawb will bea page of histori and he ought then to be repres
in the countri which gave him birth and did not give him employ
my love observ mr micawb it is imposs for me not to be
touch by your affect i am alwai will to defer to your good
sens what will bewil be heaven forbid that i should grudg my
nativ countri ani portion of the wealth that mai be accumul by our
descend
that well said my aunt nod toward mr peggotti and i drink
my love to you all and everi bless and success attend you
mr peggotti put down the two children he had been nurs on on each
knee to join mr and mr micawb in drink to all of us in return
and when he and the micawb cordial shook hand as comrad and hi
brown face brighten with a smile i felt that he would make hi wai
establish a good name and be belov go where he would
even the children were instruct each to dip a wooden spoon into mr
micawb pot and pledg us in it content when thi wa done my
aunt and agn rose and part from the emigr it wa a sorrow
farewel thei were all cry the children hung about agn to the
last and we left poor mr micawb in a veri distress condit
sob and weep by a dim candl that must have made the room look
from the river like a miser lighthous
i went down again next morn to see that thei were awai thei had
depart in a boat as earli as five oclock it wa a wonder
instanc to me of the gap such part make that although my
associ of them with the tumbledown publichous and the wooden
stair date onli from last night both seem dreari and desert now
that thei were gone
in the afternoon of the next dai my old nurs and i went down to
gravesend we found the ship in the river surround by a crowd
of boat a favour wind blow the signal for sail at her
masthead i hire a boat directli and we put off to her and get
through the littl vortex of confus of which she wa the centr went
on board
mr peggotti wa wait for us on deck he told me that mr micawb
had just now been arrest again and for the last time at the suit of
heep and that in complianc with a request i had made to him he had
paid the monei which i repaid him he then took us down between deck
and there ani linger fear i had of hi have heard ani rumour of
what had happen were dispel by mr micawb come out of the
gloom take hi arm with an air of friendship and protect and
tell me that thei had scarc been asund for a moment sinc the
night befor last
it wa such a strang scene to me and so confin and dark that at
first i could make out hardli anyth but by degre it clear as
my ey becam more accustom to the gloom and i seem to stand in
a pictur by ostad among the great beam bulk and ringbolt of the

it first attract my attent by anoth figur part from it with
a kiss and as it glide calmli awai through the disord remind

she lai between us and the red light and everi taper line and spar wa
visibl against the glow a sight at onc so beauti so mourn and
so hope as the gloriou ship ly still on the flush water
with all the life on board her crowd at the bulwark and there
cluster for a moment barehead and silent i never saw
silent onli for a moment as the sail rose to the wind and the ship
began to move there broke from all the boat three resound cheer
which those on board took up and echo back and which were echo

ashoreand fallen darkli upon me
chapter 58 absenc
it wa a long and gloomi night that gather on me haunt by the
ghost of mani hope of mani dear remembr mani error mani
unavail sorrow and regret
i went awai from england not know even then how great the shock
wa that i had to bear i left all who were dear to me and went awai
and believ that i had born it and it wa past as a man upon a
field of battl will receiv a mortal hurt and scarc know that he is
struck so i when i wa left alon with my undisciplin heart had no
concept of the wound with which it had to strive
the knowledg came upon me not quickli but littl by littl and grain
by grain the desol feel with which i went abroad deepen
and widen hourli at first it wa a heavi sens of loss and sorrow
wherein i could distinguish littl els by impercept degre
it becam a hopeless conscious of all that i had lostlov
friendship interest of all that had been shatteredmi first trust
my first affect the whole airi castl of my life of all that
remaineda ruin blank and wast ly wide around me unbroken to
the dark horizon
if my grief were selfish i did not know it to be so i mourn for my
childwif taken from her bloom world so young i mourn for him
who might have won the love and admir of thousand as he had won
mine long ago i mourn for the broken heart that had found rest in the
stormi sea and for the wander remnant of the simpl home where i
had heard the nightwind blow when i wa a child
from the accumul sad into which i fell i had at length no hope
of ever issu again i roam from place to place carri my burden
with me everywher i felt it whole weight now and i droop beneath
it and i said in my heart that it could never be lighten
when thi despond wa at it worst i believ that i should die
sometim i thought that i would like to die at home and actual
turn back on my road that i might get there soon at other time i
pass on farther awayfrom citi to citi seek i know not what and
try to leav i know not what behind
it is not in my power to retrac on by on all the weari phase of
distress of mind through which i pass there ar some dream that can
onli be imperfectli and vagu describ and when i oblig myself to
look back on thi time of my life i seem to be recal such a dream
i see myself pass on among the novelti of foreign town palac
cathedr templ pictur castl tomb fantast streetsth
old abid place of histori and fancya a dreamer might bear my
pain load through all and hardli consciou of the object as thei
fade befor me listless to everyth but brood sorrow wa the
night that fell on my undisciplin heart let me look up from ita
at last i did thank heavenand from it long sad wretch dream to
dawn
for mani month i travel with thi everdarken cloud upon my
mind some blind reason that i had for not return homereason then
struggl within me vainli for more distinct expressionkept me
on my pilgrimag sometim i had proceed restlessli from place to
place stop nowher sometim i had linger long in on spot i
had had no purpos no sustain soul within me anywher
i wa in switzerland i had come out of itali over on of the great
pass of the alp and had sinc wander with a guid among the
bywai of the mountain if those aw solitud had spoken to my
heart i did not know it i had found sublim and wonder in the dread
height and precipic in the roar torrent and the wast of ic
and snow but as yet thei had taught me noth els
i came on even befor sunset down into a vallei where i wa to
rest in the cours of my descent to it by the wind track along
the mountainsid from which i saw it shine far below i think some
longunwont sens of beauti and tranquil some soften influenc
awaken by it peac move faintli in my breast i rememb paus
onc with a kind of sorrow that wa not all oppress not quit
despair i rememb almost hope that some better chang wa
possibl within me
i came into the vallei as the even sun wa shine on the remot
height of snow that close it in like etern cloud the base of
the mountain form the gorg in which the littl villag lai were
richli green and high abov thi gentler veget grew forest of
dark fir cleav the wintri snowdrift wedgelik and stem the
avalanch abov these were rang upon rang of craggi steep grei
rock bright ic and smooth verdurespeck of pastur all gradual
blend with the crown snow dot here and there on the
mountainssid each tini dot a home were lone wooden cottag so
dwarf by the tower height that thei appear too small for toi
so did even the cluster villag in the vallei with it wooden bridg
across the stream where the stream tumbl over broken rock and
roar awai among the tree in the quiet air there wa a sound of
distant singingshepherd voic but as on bright even cloud
float midwai along the mountainssid i could almost have believ
it came from there and wa not earthli music all at onc in thi
seren great natur spoke to me and sooth me to lai down my weari
head upon the grass and weep as i had not wept yet sinc dora di
i had found a packet of letter await me but a few minut befor
and had stroll out of the villag to read them while my supper wa
make readi other packet had miss me and i had receiv none for a
long time beyond a line or two to sai that i wa well and had arriv
at such a place i had not had fortitud or constanc to write a letter
sinc i left home
the packet wa in my hand i open it and read the write of agn
she wa happi and us wa prosper as she had hope that wa all
she told me of herself the rest refer to me
she gave me no advic she urg no duti on me she onli told me in her
own fervent manner what her trust in me wa she knew she said how
such a natur as mine would turn afflict to good she knew how trial
and emot would exalt and strengthen it she wa sure that in my everi
purpos i should gain a firmer and a higher tendenc through the grief
i had undergon she who so glori in my fame and so look forward
to it augment well knew that i would labour on she knew that in
me sorrow could not be weak but must be strength as the endur
of my childish dai had done it part to make me what i wa so greater
calam would nerv me on to be yet better than i wa and so as
thei had taught me would i teach other she commend me to god who
had taken my innoc darl to hi rest and in her sisterli affect
cherish me alwai and wa alwai at my side go where i would proud
of what i had done but infinit prouder yet of what i wa reserv to
do
i put the letter in my breast and thought what had i been an hour ago
when i heard the voic die awai and saw the quiet even cloud grow
dim and all the colour in the vallei fade and the golden snow upon
the mountaintop becom a remot part of the pale night sky yet felt
that the night wa pass from my mind and all it shadow clear
there wa no name for the love i bore her dearer to me henceforward
than ever until then
i read her letter mani time i wrote to her befor i slept i told her
that i had been in sore need of her help that without her i wa not
and i never had been what she thought me but that she inspir me to
be that and i would try
i did try in three month more a year would have pass sinc the
begin of my sorrow i determin to make no resolut until the
expir of those three month but to try i live in that vallei
and it neighbourhood all the time
the three month gone i resolv to remain awai from home for some
time longer to settl myself for the present in switzerland which wa
grow dear to me in the remembr of that even to resum my pen
to work
i resort humbl whither agn had commend me i sought out natur
never sought in vain and i admit to my breast the human interest
i had late shrunk from it wa not long befor i had almost as mani
friend in the vallei as in yarmouth and when i left it befor the
winter set in for geneva and came back in the spring their cordial
greet had a home sound to me although thei were not convei in
english word
i work earli and late patient and hard i wrote a stori with a
purpos grow not remot out of my experi and sent it to
traddl and he arrang for it public veri advantag for
me and the tide of my grow reput began to reach me from
travel whom i encount by chanc after some rest and chang i
fell to work in my old ardent wai on a new fanci which took strong
possess of me as i advanc in the execut of thi task i felt it
more and more and rous my utmost energi to do it well thi wa my
third work of fiction it wa not half written when in an interv of
rest i thought of return home
for a long time though studi and work patient i had accustom
myself to robust exercis my health sever impair when i left
england wa quit restor i had seen much i had been in mani
countri and i hope i had improv my store of knowledg
i have now recal all that i think it need to recal here of thi
term of absencewith on reserv i have made it thu far with
no purpos of suppress ani of my thought for as i have elsewher
said thi narr is my written memori i have desir to keep the
most secret current of my mind apart and to the last i enter on it
now i cannot so complet penetr the mysteri of my own heart as
to know when i began to think that i might have set it earliest and
brightest hope on agn i cannot sai at what stage of my grief
it first becam associ with the reflect that in my wayward
boyhood i had thrown awai the treasur of her love i believ i mai
have heard some whisper of that distant thought in the old unhappi loss
or want of someth never to be realiz of which i had been sensibl
but the thought came into my mind as a new reproach and new regret when
i wa left so sad and lone in the world
if at that time i had been much with her i should in the weak of
my desol have betrai thi it wa what i remot dread when i
wa first impel to stai awai from england i could not have born
to lose the smallest portion of her sisterli affect yet in that
betray i should have set a constraint between us hitherto unknown
i could not forget that the feel with which she now regard me had
grown up in my own free choic and cours that if she had ever love me
with anoth loveand i sometim thought the time wa when she might
have done soi had cast it awai it wa noth now that i had
accustom myself to think of her when we were both mere children
as on who wa far remov from my wild fanci i had bestow my
passion tender upon anoth object and what i might have done
i had not done and what agn wa to me i and her own nobl heart had
made her
in the begin of the chang that gradual work in me when i
tri to get a better understand of myself and be a better man i
did glanc through some indefinit probat to a period when i might
possibl hope to cancel the mistaken past and to be so bless as
to marri her but as time wore on thi shadowi prospect fade and
depart from me if she had ever love me then i should hold her
the more sacr rememb the confid i had repos in her her
knowledg of my errant heart the sacrific she must have made to be my
friend and sister and the victori she had won if she had never love
me could i believ that she would love me now
i had alwai felt my weak in comparison with her constanc and
fortitud and now i felt it more and more whatev i might have been
to her or she to me if i had been more worthi of her long ago i wa
not now and she wa not the time wa past i had let it go by and had
deservedli lost her
that i suffer much in these content that thei fill me with
unhappi and remors and yet that i had a sustain sens that it
wa requir of me in right and honour to keep awai from myself with
shame the thought of turn to the dear girl in the wither of my
hope from whom i had frivol turn when thei were bright and
freshwhich consider wa at the root of everi thought i had
concern heri all equal true i made no effort to conceal from
myself now that i love her that i wa devot to her but i brought
the assur home to myself that it wa now too late and that our
longsubsist relat must be undisturb
i had thought much and often of my dora shadow out to me what
might have happen in those year that were destin not to try us
i had consid how the thing that never happen ar often as much
realiti to us in their effect as those that ar accomplish the
veri year she spoke of were realiti now for my correct and
would have been on dai a littl later perhap though we had part
in our earliest folli i endeavour to convert what might have been
between myself and agn into a mean of make me more selfdeni
more resolv more consciou of myself and my defect and error
thu through the reflect that it might have been i arriv at the
convict that it could never be
these with their perplex and inconsist were the shift
quicksand of my mind from the time of my departur to the time of my
return home three year afterward three year had elaps sinc the
sail of the emigr ship when at that same hour of sunset and in
the same place i stood on the deck of the packet vessel that brought me
home look on the rosi water where i had seen the imag of that ship
reflect
three year long in the aggreg though short as thei went by and
home wa veri dear to me and agn toobut she wa not minesh wa
never to be mine she might have been but that wa past
chapter 59 return
i land in london on a wintri autumn even it wa dark and rain
and i saw more fog and mud in a minut than i had seen in a year i
walk from the custom hous to the monument befor i found a coach
and although the veri housefront look on the swollen gutter were
like old friend to me i could not but admit that thei were veri dingi
friend
i have often remarkedi suppos everybodi hasthat on go awai
from a familiar place would seem to be the signal for chang in it
as i look out of the coach window and observ that an old hous on
fishstreet hill which had stood untouch by painter carpent or
bricklay for a centuri had been pull down in my absenc and that
a neighbour street of timehonour insalubr and inconveni
wa be drain and widen i half expect to find st paul
cathedr look older
for some chang in the fortun of my friend i wa prepar my aunt
had long been reestablish at dover and traddl had begun to get
into some littl practic at the bar in the veri first term after my
departur he had chamber in grai inn now and had told me in hi
last letter that he wa not without hope of be soon unit to the
dearest girl in the world
thei expect me home befor christma but had no idea of my return
so soon i had purpos misl them that i might have the pleasur of
take them by surpris and yet i wa pervers enough to feel a chill
and disappoint in receiv no welcom and rattl alon and
silent through the misti street
the wellknown shop howev with their cheer light did someth
for me and when i alight at the door of the grai inn coffeehous
i had recov my spirit it recal at first that sodiffer
time when i had put up at the golden cross and remind me of the
chang that had come to pass sinc then but that wa natur
do you know where mr traddl live in the inn i ask the waiter
as i warm myself by the coffeeroom fire
holborn court sir number two
mr traddl ha a rise reput among the lawyer i believ
said i
well sir return the waiter probabl he ha sir but i am not
awar of it myself
thi waiter who wa middleag and spare look for help to a waiter
of more authoritya stout potenti old man with a doubl chin
in black breech and stock who came out of a place like a
churchwarden pew at the end of the coffeeroom where he kept compani
with a cashbox a directori a lawlist and other book and paper
mr traddl said the spare waiter number two in the court
the potenti waiter wave him awai and turn grave to me
i wa inquir said i whether mr traddl at number two in the
court ha not a rise reput among the lawyer
never heard hi name said the waiter in a rich huski voic
i felt quit apologet for traddl
he a young man sure said the portent waiter fix hi ey
sever on me how long ha he been in the inn
not abov three year said i
the waiter who i suppos had live in hi churchwarden pew for forti
year could not pursu such an insignific subject he ask me what
i would have for dinner
i felt i wa in england again and realli wa quit cast down on
traddless account there seem to be no hope for him i meekli order
a bit of fish and a steak and stood befor the fire muse on hi
obscur
as i follow the chief waiter with my ey i could not help think
that the garden in which he had gradual blown to be the flower he
wa wa an arduou place to rise in it had such a prescript
stiffneck longestablish solemn elderli air i glanc about the
room which had had it sand floor sand no doubt in exactli the
same manner when the chief waiter wa a boyif he ever wa a boi
which appear improb and at the shine tabl where i saw
myself reflect in unruffl depth of old mahogani and at the lamp
without a flaw in their trim or clean and at the comfort
green curtain with their pure brass rod snugli enclos the box
and at the two larg coal fire brightli burn and at the row of
decant burli as if with the conscious of pipe of expens old
port wine below and both england and the law appear to me to be
veri difficult inde to be taken by storm i went up to my bedroom
to chang my wet cloth and the vast extent of that old wainscot
apart which wa over the archwai lead to the inn i rememb
and the sedat immens of the fourpost bedstead and the indomit
graviti of the chest of drawer all seem to unit in sternli
frown on the fortun of traddl or on ani such dare youth i
came down again to my dinner and even the slow comfort of the meal
and the orderli silenc of the placewhich wa bare of guest the long
vacat not yet be overwer eloqu on the audac of traddl
and hi small hope of a livelihood for twenti year to come
i had seen noth like thi sinc i went awai and it quit dash my
hope for my friend the chief waiter had had enough of me he came near
me no more but devot himself to an old gentleman in long gaiter to
meet whom a pint of special port seem to come out of the cellar of it
own accord for he gave no order the second waiter inform me in a
whisper that thi old gentleman wa a retir conveyanc live in the
squar and worth a mint of monei which it wa expect he would leav
to hi laundresss daughter likewis that it wa rumour that he had
a servic of plate in a bureau all tarnish with ly by though more
than on spoon and a fork had never yet been beheld in hi chamber
by mortal vision by thi time i quit gave traddl up for lost and
settl in my own mind that there wa no hope for him
be veri anxiou to see the dear old fellow nevertheless i
dispatch my dinner in a manner not at all calcul to rais me in
the opinion of the chief waiter and hurri out by the back wai number
two in the court wa soon reach and an inscript on the doorpost
inform me that mr traddl occupi a set of chamber on the top
storei i ascend the staircas a crazi old staircas i found it to
be feebli light on each land by a clubhead littl oil wick
dy awai in a littl dungeon of dirti glass
in the cours of my stumbl upstair i fanci i heard a pleasant
sound of laughter and not the laughter of an attornei or barrist or
attornei clerk or barrist clerk but of two or three merri girl

where the honour societi of grai inn had left a plank defici
i fell down with some nois and when i recov my foot all wa

someth in the shape of teaspoon becaus we stir our tea but
theyr britannia metal
the silver will be the brighter when it come said i
the veri thing we sai cri traddl you see my dear copperfield
fall again into the low confidenti tone after i had deliv my
argument in doe dem jipe versu wigziel which did me great servic
with the profess i went down into devonshir and had some seriou
convers in privat with the reverend horac i dwelt upon the fact
that sophywho i do assur you copperfield is the dearest girl
i am certain she is said i
she is inde rejoin traddl but i am afraid i am wander
from the subject did i mention the reverend horac
you said that you dwelt upon the fact
true upon the fact that sophi and i had been engag for a long
period and that sophi with the permiss of her parent wa more
than content to take mein short said traddl with hi old frank
smile on our present britanniamet foot veri well i then
propos to the reverend horacewho is a most excel clergyman
copperfield and ought to be a bishop or at least ought to have enough
to live upon without pinch himselfthat if i could turn the corner
sai of two hundr and fifti pound in on year and could see my
wai pretti clearli to that or someth better next year and could
plainli furnish a littl place like thi besid then and in that
case sophi and i should be unit i took the liberti of repres
that we had been patient for a good mani year and that the
circumst of sophi be extraordinarili us at home ought not
to oper with her affection parent against her establish in
lifedont you see
certainli it ought not said i
i am glad you think so copperfield rejoin traddl becaus
without ani imput on the reverend horac i do think parent and
brother and so forth ar sometim rather selfish in such case
well i also point out that my most earnest desir wa to be us
to the famili and that if i got on in the world and anyth should
happen to himi refer to the reverend horac
i understand said i
or to mr crewlerit would be the utmost gratif of my
wish to be a parent to the girl he repli in a most admir
manner exceedingli flatter to my feel and undertook to obtain
the consent of mr crewler to thi arrang thei had a dread
time of it with her it mount from her leg into her chest and then
into her head
what mount i ask
her grief repli traddl with a seriou look her feel
gener as i mention on a former occas she is a veri superior
woman but ha lost the us of her limb whatev occur to harass
her usual settl in her leg but on thi occas it mount to the
chest and then to the head and in short pervad the whole system
in a most alarm manner howev thei brought her through it by
unremit and affection attent and we were marri yesterdai
six week you have no idea what a monster i felt copperfield when i
saw the whole famili cry and faint awai in everi direct mr
crewler couldnt see me befor we leftcouldnt forgiv me then for
depriv her of her childbut she is a good creatur and ha done so
sinc i had a delight letter from her onli thi morn
and in short my dear friend said i you feel as blest as you
deserv to feel
oh that your partial laugh traddl but inde i am in a
most enviabl state i work hard and read law insati i get up at
five everi morn and dont mind it at all i hide the girl in the
daytim and make merri with them in the even and i assur you i am
quit sorri that thei ar go home on tuesdai which is the dai befor
the first dai of michaelma term but here said traddl break off
in hi confid and speak aloud ar the girl mr copperfield
miss crewlermiss sarahmiss louisamargaret and luci
thei were a perfect nest of rose thei look so wholesom and fresh
thei were all pretti and miss carolin wa veri handsom but there wa
a love cheer firesid qualiti in sophi bright look which wa
better than that and which assur me that my friend had chosen well
we all sat round the fire while the sharp boi who i now divin had
lost hi breath in put the paper out clear them awai again and
produc the teath after that he retir for the night shut
the outer door upon us with a bang mr traddl with perfect pleasur
and composur beam from her household ey have made the tea then
quietli made the toast as she sat in a corner by the fire
she had seen agn she told me while she wa toast tom had taken
her down into kent for a wed trip and there she had seen my aunt
too and both my aunt and agn were well and thei had all talk of
noth but me tom had never had me out of hi thought she realli
believ all the time i had been awai tom wa the author for
everyth tom wa evid the idol of her life never to be shaken
on hi pedest by ani commot alwai to be believ in and done
homag to with the whole faith of her heart come what might
the defer which both she and traddl show toward the beauti
pleas me veri much i dont know that i thought it veri reason
but i thought it veri delight and essenti a part of their
charact if traddl ever for an instant miss the teaspoon that
were still to be won i have no doubt it wa when he hand the beauti
her tea if hi sweettemp wife could have got up ani selfassert
against anyon i am satisfi it could onli have been becaus she wa
the beauti sister a few slight indic of a rather pet and
caprici manner which i observ in the beauti were manifestli
consid by traddl and hi wife as her birthright and natur
endow if she had been born a queen bee and thei labour bee
thei could not have been more satisfi of that
but their selfforget charm me their pride in these girl and
their submiss of themselv to all their whim wa the pleasantest
littl testimoni to their own worth i could have desir to see if
traddl were address as a darl onc in the cours of that
even and besought to bring someth here or carri someth there
or take someth up or put someth down or find someth or fetch
someth he wa so address by on or other of hi sistersinlaw
at least twelv time in an hour neither could thei do anyth without
sophi somebodi hair fell down and nobodi but sophi could put it up
somebodi forgot how a particular tune went and nobodi but sophi could
hum that tune right somebodi want to recal the name of a place in
devonshir and onli sophi knew it someth wa want to be written
home and sophi alon could be trust to write befor breakfast in
the morn somebodi broke down in a piec of knit and no on but
sophi wa abl to put the default in the right direct thei were
entir mistress of the place and sophi and traddl wait on them
how mani children sophi could have taken care of in her time i cant
imagin but she seem to be famou for know everi sort of song that
ever wa address to a child in the english tongu and she sang dozen
to order with the clearest littl voic in the world on after anoth
everi sister issu direct for a differ tune and the beauti
gener strike in last so that i wa quit fascin the best
of all wa that in the midst of their exact all the sister had
a great tender and respect both for sophi and traddl i am sure
when i took my leav and traddl wa come out to walk with me to the
coffeehous i thought i had never seen an obstin head of hair or
ani other head of hair roll about in such a shower of kiss
altogeth it wa a scene i could not help dwell on with pleasur
for a long time after i got back and had wish traddl good night if
i had beheld a thousand rose blow in a top set of chamber in that
wither grai inn thei could not have brighten it half so much
the idea of those devonshir girl among the dry lawstation and the
attornei offic and of the tea and toast and children song in
that grim atmospher of pounc and parchment redtap dusti wafer
inkjar brief and draft paper law report writ declar and
bill of cost seem almost as pleasantli fanci as if i had
dream that the sultan famou famili had been admit on the roll of
attornei and had brought the talk bird the sing tree and the
golden water into grai inn hall somehow i found that i had taken
leav of traddl for the night and come back to the coffeehous with
a great chang in my despond about him i began to think he would
get on in spite of all the mani order of chief waiter in england
draw a chair befor on of the coffeeroom fire to think about him
at my leisur i gradual fell from the consider of hi happi
to trace prospect in the liveco and to think as thei broke
and chang of the princip vicissitud and separ that had
mark my life i had not seen a coal fire sinc i had left england
three year ago though mani a wood fire had i watch as it crumbl
into hoari ash and mingl with the featheri heap upon the hearth
which not inaptli figur to me in my despond my own dead hope
i could think of the past now grave but not bitterli and could
contempl the futur in a brave spirit home in it best sens wa
for me no more she in whom i might have inspir a dearer love i had
taught to be my sister she would marri and would have new claimant on
her tender and in do it would never know the love for her that
had grown up in my heart it wa right that i should pai the forfeit of
my headlong passion what i reap i had sown
i wa think and had i truli disciplin my heart to thi and could
i resolut bear it and calmli hold the place in her home which she
had calmli held in minewhen i found my ey rest on a counten

smile at the fire and sai in hi forgiv wai old creakl
i have a letter from that oldrasc here said i for i never wa
less dispos to forgiv him the wai he us to batter traddl than
when i saw traddl so readi to forgiv him himself
from creakl the schoolmast exclaim traddl no
among the person who ar attract to me in my rise fame and
fortun said i look over my letter and who discov that thei
were alwai much attach to me is the selfsam creakl he is not
a schoolmast now traddl he is retir he is a middlesex
magistr
i thought traddl might be surpris to hear it but he wa not so at
all
how do you suppos he come to be a middlesex magistr said i
oh dear me repli traddl it would be veri difficult to answer
that question perhap he vote for somebodi or lent monei to somebodi
or bought someth of somebodi or otherwis oblig somebodi or
job for somebodi who knew somebodi who got the lieuten of the
counti to nomin him for the commiss
on the commiss he is at ani rate said i and he write to me
here that he will be glad to show me in oper the onli true
system of prison disciplin the onli unchalleng wai of make
sincer and last convert and penitentswhich you know is by
solitari confin what do you sai
to the system inquir traddl look grave
no to my accept the offer and your go with me
i dont object said traddl
then ill write to sai so you rememb to sai noth of our
treatment thi same creakl turn hi son out of door i suppos
and the life he us to lead hi wife and daughter
perfectli said traddl
yet if youll read hi letter youll find he is the tenderest of
men to prison convict of the whole calendar of feloni said i
though i cant find that hi tender extend to ani other class of
creat be
traddl shrug hi shoulder and wa not at all surpris i had not
expect him to be and wa not surpris myself or my observ of
similar practic satir would have been but scanti we arrang the
time of our visit and i wrote accordingli to mr creakl that even
on the appoint dayi think it wa the next dai but no
mattertraddl and i repair to the prison where mr creakl wa
power it wa an immens and solid build erect at a vast
expens i could not help think as we approach the gate what
an uproar would have been made in the countri if ani delud man had
propos to spend on half the monei it had cost on the erect of an
industri school for the young or a hous of refug for the deserv
old
in an offic that might have been on the groundfloor of the tower of
babel it wa so massiv construct we were present to our old
schoolmast who wa on of a group compos of two or three of the
busier sort of magistr and some visitor thei had brought he
receiv me like a man who had form my mind in bygon year and
had alwai love me tenderli on my introduc traddl mr creakl
express in like manner but in an inferior degre that he had alwai
been traddless guid philosoph and friend our vener instructor
wa a great deal older and not improv in appear hi face wa
as fieri as ever hi ey were as small and rather deeper set the
scanti wetlook grei hair by which i rememb him wa almost
gone and the thick vein in hi bald head were none the more agreeabl
to look at
after some convers among these gentlemen from which i might have
suppos that there wa noth in the world to be legitim taken
into account but the suprem comfort of prison at ani expens and
noth on the wide earth to be done outsid prisondoor we began
our inspect it be then just dinnertim we went first into the
great kitchen where everi prison dinner wa in cours of be set
out separ to be hand to him in hi cell with the regular
and precis of clockwork i said asid to traddl that i wonder
whether it occur to anybodi that there wa a strike contrast
between these plenti repast of choic qualiti and the dinner not
to sai of pauper but of soldier sailor labour the great bulk
of the honest work commun of whom not on man in five hundr
ever dine half so well but i learn that the system requir high
live and in short to dispos of the system onc for all i found
that on that head and on all other the system put an end to all
doubt and dispos of all anomali nobodi appear to have the least
idea that there wa ani other system but the system to be consid
as we were go through some of the magnific passag i inquir of
mr creakl and hi friend what were suppos to be the main advantag
of thi allgovern and univers overrid system i found
them to be the perfect isol of prisonersso that no on man in
confin there knew anyth about anoth and the reduct of
prison to a wholesom state of mind lead to sincer contrit
and repent
now it struck me when we began to visit individu in their cell
and to travers the passag in which those cell were and to have the
manner of the go to chapel and so forth explain to us that there
wa a strong probabl of the prison know a good deal about each
other and of their carri on a pretti complet system of intercours
thi at the time i write ha been prove i believ to be the case
but as it would have been flat blasphemi against the system to have
hint such a doubt then i look out for the penit as dilig
as i could
and here again i had great misgiv i found as preval a fashion
in the form of the penit as i had left outsid in the form of the
coat and waistcoat in the window of the tailor shop i found a
vast amount of profess vari veri littl in charact vari

their want of excit and their love of decept which mani
of them possess to an almost incred extent as their histori
show all prompt to these profess and were all gratifi by
them

number twenti seven last folli
the answer wa that it wa a bank case
a fraud on the bank of england i ask ye sir fraud forgeri
and conspiraci he and some other he set the other on it wa a deep
plot for a larg sum sentenc transport for life twenti seven
wa the knowingest bird of the lot and had veri nearli kept himself
safe but not quit the bank wa just abl to put salt upon hi
tailand onli just
do you know twenti eight offenc
twenti eight return my inform speak throughout in a low
tone and look over hi shoulder as we walk along the passag to
guard himself from be overheard in such an unlaw refer
to these immacul by creakl and the rest twenti eight also
transport got a place and rob a young master of a matter of
two hundr and fifti pound in monei and valuabl the night befor
thei were go abroad i particularli recollect hi case from hi

that it he had elud pursuit and wa go to america in a flaxen
wig and whisker and such a complet disguis as never you see in all
your born dai when the littl woman be in southampton met

momentran betwixt hi leg to upset himand held on to him like grim
death
excel miss mowcher cri i
youd have said so if you had seen her stand on a chair in the
witnessbox at the trial as i did said my friend he cut her face
right open and pound her in the most brutal manner when she took
him but she never loos her hold till he wa lock up she held so
tight to him in fact that the offic were oblig to take em

we had now seen all there wa to see it would have been in vain to
repres to such a man as the worship mr creakl that twenti seven
and twenti eight were perfectli consist and unchang that exactli
what thei were then thei had alwai been that the hypocrit knave
were just the subject to make that sort of profess in such a place

immedi servic it would do them when thei were expatri in
a word that it wa a rotten hollow painfulli suggest piec of

went home wonder
perhap it a good thing traddl said i to have an unsound hobbi
ridden hard for it the sooner ridden to death

when i read to agn what i wrote when i saw her listen face move
her to smile or tear and heard her cordial voic so earnest on the

my duti to agn who love me with a love which if i disquiet i
wrong most selfishli and poorli and could never restor my matur
assur that i who had work out my own destini and won what i

chapter 64 a last retrospect
and now my written stori end i look back onc morefor the last
timebefor i close these leav
i see myself with agn at my side journei along the road of life
i see our children and our friend around us and i hear the roar of
mani voic not indiffer to me as i travel on
what face ar the most distinct to me in the fleet crowd lo these
all turn to me as i ask my thought the question
here is my aunt in stronger spectacl an old woman of fourscor
year and more but upright yet and a steadi walker of six mile at a
stretch in winter weather
alwai with her here come peggotti my good old nurs likewis in
spectacl accustom to do needlework at night veri close to the
lamp but never sit down to it without a bit of wax candl a
yardmeasur in a littl hous and a workbox with a pictur of st
paul upon the lid
the cheek and arm of peggotti so hard and red in my childish dai
when i wonder why the bird didnt peck her in prefer to appl
ar shrivel now and her ey that us to darken their whole
neighbourhood in her face ar fainter though thei glitter still
but her rough forefing which i onc associ with a pocket
nutmeggrat is just the same and when i see my least child catch
at it as it totter from my aunt to her i think of our littl parlour
at home when i could scarc walk my aunt old disappoint is set
right now she is godmoth to a real live betsei trotwood and dora
the next in order sai she spoil her
there is someth bulki in peggotti pocket it is noth smaller
than the crocodil book which is in rather a dilapid condit by
thi time with diver of the leav torn and stitch across but which
peggotti exhibit to the children as a preciou relic i find it veri
curiou to see my own infant face look up at me from the crocodil
stori and to be remind by it of my old acquaint brook of
sheffield
among my boi thi summer holidai time i see an old man make giant
kite and gaze at them in the air with a delight for which there
ar no word he greet me raptur and whisper with mani nod
and wink trotwood you will be glad to hear that i shall finish the
memori when i have noth els to do and that your aunt the most
extraordinari woman in the world sir
who is thi bent ladi support herself by a stick and show me
a counten in which there ar some trace of old pride and beauti
feebli contend with a querul imbecil fret wander of the
mind she is in a garden and near her stand a sharp dark wither
woman with a white scar on her lip let me hear what thei sai
rosa i have forgotten thi gentleman name
rosa bend over her and call to her mr copperfield
i am glad to see you sir i am sorri to observ you ar in mourn i
hope time will be good to you
her impati attend scold her tell her i am not in mourn bid
her look again tri to rous her
you have seen my son sir sai the elder ladi ar you reconcil
look fixedli at me she put her hand to her forehead and moan
suddenli she cri in a terribl voic rosa come to me he is
dead rosa kneel at her feet by turn caress her and quarrel

sing affect dirg etern quarrel with the old scotch croesu
who is a sort of yellow bear with a tan hide julia is steep in
monei to the throat and talk and think of noth els i like her
better in the desert of sahara
or perhap thi is the desert of sahara for though julia ha a state
hous and mighti compani and sumptuou dinner everi dai i see no
green growth near her noth that can ever come to fruit or flower
what julia call societi i see among it mr jack maldon from hi
patent place sneer at the hand that gave it him and speak to me
of the doctor as so charmingli antiqu but when societi is the name
for such hollow gentlemen and ladi julia and when it breed is
profess indiffer to everyth that can advanc or can retard
mankind i think we must have lost ourselv in that same desert of
sahara and had better find the wai out
