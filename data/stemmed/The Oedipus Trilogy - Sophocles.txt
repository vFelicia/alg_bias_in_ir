enter oedipu
oedipu
ye prai ti well but would ye hear my word
and heed them and appli the remedi
ye might perchanc find comfort and relief
mind you i speak as on who come a stranger
to thi report no less than to the crime
for how unaid could i track it far
without a clue which lack for too late
wa i enrol a citizen of thebe
thi proclam i address to all
theban if ani know the man by whom
laiu son of labdacu wa slain
i summon him to make clean shrift to me
and if he shrink let him reflect that thu
confess he shall scape the capit charg
for the worst penalti that shall befal him
is banishmentunscath he shall depart
but if an alien from a foreign land
be known to ani as the murder
let him who know speak out and he shall have
due recompens from me and thank to boot
but if ye still keep silenc if through fear
for self or friend ye disregard my hest
hear what i then resolv i lai my ban
on the assassin whosoeer he be
let no man in thi land whereof i hold
the sovereign rule harbor or speak to him
give him no part in prayer or sacrific
or lustral rite but hound him from your home
for thi is our defil so the god
hath late shown to me by oracl
thu as their champion i maintain the caus
both of the god and of the murder king
and on the murder thi curs i lai
on him and all the partner in hi guilt
wretch mai he pine in utter wretched
and for myself if with my priviti
he gain admitt to my hearth i prai
the curs i laid on other fall on me
see that ye give effect to all my hest
for my sake and the god and for our land
a desert blast by the wrath of heaven
for let alon the god express command
it were a scandal ye should leav unpurg
the murder of a great man and your king
nor track it home and now that i am lord
successor to hi throne hi bed hi wife
and had he not been frustrat in the hope
of issu common children of on womb
had forc a closer bond twixt him and me
but fate swoop down upon him therefor i
hi bloodaveng will maintain hi caus
as though he were my sire and leav no stone
unturn to track the assassin or aveng
the son of labdacu of polydor
of cadmu and agenor first of the race
and for the disobedi thu i prai
mai the god send them neither time fruit
of earth nor teem increas of the womb
but mai thei wast and pine as now thei wast
ay and wors stricken but to all of you
my loyal subject who approv my act
mai justic our alli and all the god
be graciou and attend you evermor
choru
the oath thou profferest sire i take and swear
i slew him not myself nor can i name
the slayer for the quest twere well methink
that phoebu who propos the riddl himself
should give the answerwho the murder wa
oedipu
well argu but no live man can hope
to forc the god to speak against their will
choru

to approach my door thou brazenfac rogu

come answer thi didst thou detect in me
some touch of cowardic or witless
that made thee undertak thi enterpris
i seem forsooth too simpl to perceiv
the serpent steal on me in the dark
or els too weak to scotch it when i saw
thi thou art witless seek to possess
without a follow or friend the crown
a prize that follow and wealth must win
creon
attend me thou hast spoken ti my turn
to make repli then have heard me judg
oedipu
thou art glib of tongu but i am slow to learn
of thee i know too well thy venom hate
creon
first i would argu out thi veri point
oedipu
o argu not that thou art not a rogu
creon
if thou dost count a virtu stubborn
unschool by reason thou art much astrai
oedipu
if thou dost hold a kinsman mai be wrong
and no pain follow thou art much to seek
creon
therein thou judgest rightli but thi wrong

didst thou or didst thou not advis that i
should call the priest

tell me how long is it sinc laiu
creon
sinc laiu i follow not thy drift
oedipu
by violent hand wa spirit awai
creon
in the dim past a mani year agon
oedipu
did the same prophet then pursu hi craft
creon
ye skill as now and in no less reput
oedipu
did he at that time ever glanc at me
creon
not to my knowledg not when i wa by
oedipu
but wa no search and inquisit made
creon
sure full quest wa made but noth learnt
oedipu
why fail the seer to tell hi stori then
creon
i know not and not know hold my tongu
oedipu
thi much thou knowest and canst sure tell
creon
what meanst thou all i know i will declar
oedipu
but for thy prompt never had the seer
ascrib to me the death of laiu
creon
if so he thou knowest best but i
would put thee to the question in my turn
oedipu
question and prove me murder if thou canst
creon
then let me ask thee didst thou wed my sister
oedipu
a fact so plain i cannot well deni
creon
and as thy consort queen she share the throne
oedipu
i grant her freeli all her heart desir
creon
and with you twain i share the tripl rule
oedipu
yea and it is that prove thee a fals friend
creon
not so if thou wouldst reason with thyself
as i with myself first i bid thee think
would ani mortal choos a troubl reign
of terror rather than secur repos
if the same power were given him as for me
i have no natur crave for the name
of king prefer to do kingli deed
and so think everi sobermind man
now all my need ar satisfi through thee
and i have naught to fear but were i king
my act would oft run counter to my will
how could a titl then have charm for me
abov the sweet of boundless influenc
i am not so infatu as to grasp
the shadow when i hold the substanc fast
now all men cry me godspe wish me well
and everi suitor seek to gain my ear
if he would hope to win a grace from thee
why should i leav the better choos the wors
that were sheer mad and i am not mad
no such ambit ever tempt me
nor would i have a share in such intrigu
and if thou doubt me first to delphi go
there ascertain if my report wa true
of the god answer next investig
if with the seer i plot or conspir
and if it prove so sentenc me to death
not by thy voic alon but mine and thine
but o condemn me not without appeal
on bare suspicion ti not right to adjudg
bad men at random good or good men bad
i would as lief a man should cast awai
the thing he count most preciou hi own life
as spurn a true friend thou wilt learn in time
the truth for time alon reveal the just
a villain is detect in a dai
choru
to on who walketh warili hi word
commend themselv swift counsel ar not sure
oedipu
when with swift stride the stealthi plotter stalk
i must be quick too with my counterplot
to wait hi onset passiv for him
is sure success for me assur defeat
creon
what then thy will to banish me the land
oedipu
i would not have thee banish no but dead
that men mai mark the wage envi reap
creon
i see thou wilt not yield nor credit me

a child that should be born to him by me
now laiusso at least report affirm

no nativ at a spot where three road meet
as for the child it wa but three dai old
when laiu it ankl pierc and pin
togeth gave it to be cast awai
by other on the trackless mountain side
so then apollo brought it not to pass
the child should be hi father murder
or the dread terror find accomplish
and laiu be slain by hi own son

now my imagin have gone so far
who ha a higher claim that thou to hear

the insult on the morrow i sought out
my mother and my sire and question them
thei were indign at the random slur
cast on my parentag and did their best
to comfort me but still the venom barb
rankl for still the scandal spread and grew
so privili without their leav i went
to delphi and apollo sent me back
baulk of the knowledg that i came to seek
but other grievou thing he prophesi
woe lament mourn portent dire
to wit i should defil my mother bed
and rais up seed too loathsom to behold
and slai the father from whose loin i sprang
then ladyth shalt hear the veri truth
as i drew near the triplebranch road
a herald met me and a man who sat
in a car drawn by coltsa in thy tale
the man in front and the old man himself
threaten to thrust me rude from the path
then jostl by the chariot in wrath
i struck him and the old man see thi
watch till i pass and from hi car brought down
full on my head the doublepoint goad
yet wa i quit with him and more on stroke
of my good staff suffic to fling him clean
out of the chariot seat and laid him prone
and so i slew them everi on but if
betwixt thi stranger there wa aught in common
with laiu who more miser than i
what mortal could you find more godabhor
wretch whom no sojourn no citizen
mai harbor or address whom all ar bound
to harri from their home and thi same curs

forgo the sight of all my dearest on
