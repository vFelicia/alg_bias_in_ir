chapter v
and what do you think of thi latest comedi the coron at
milan ask anna pvlovna and of the comedi of the peopl of
genoa and lucca lai their petit befor monsieur buonapart and
monsieur buonapart sit on a throne and grant the petit of
the nation ador it is enough to make on head whirl it is as
if the whole world had gone crazi
princ andrew look anna pvlovna straight in the face with a
sarcast smile
dieu me la donn gare qui la touch thei sai he wa
veri fine when he said that he remark repeat the word in
italian dio mi lha dato guai a chi la tocchi
god ha given it to me let him who touch it bewar
i hope thi will prove the last drop that will make the glass run
over anna pvlovna continu the sovereign will not be abl to
endur thi man who is a menac to everyth
the sovereign i do not speak of russia said the vicomt polit
but hopeless the sovereign madam what have thei done for loui
xvii for the queen or for madam elizabeth noth and he becam
more anim and believ me thei ar reap the reward of their
betray of the bourbon caus the sovereign why thei ar send
ambassador to compliment the usurp
and sigh disdainfulli he again chang hi posit
princ hippolyt who had been gaze at the vicomt for some time
through hi lorgnett suddenli turn complet round toward the
littl princess and have ask for a needl began trace the cond
coat of arm on the tabl he explain thi to her with as much graviti
as if she had ask him to do it
bton de gueul engrl de gueul dazurmaison cond
said he
the princess listen smile
if buonapart remain on the throne of franc a year longer the
vicomt continu with the air of a man who in a matter with which
he is better acquaint than anyon els doe not listen to other but
follow the current of hi own thought thing will have gone too
far by intrigu violenc exil and execut french societyi
mean good french societywil have been forev destroi and
then
he shrug hi shoulder and spread out hi hand pierr wish to
make a remark for the convers interest him but anna pvlovna
who had him under observ interrupt
the emperor alexand said she with the melancholi which
alwai accompani ani refer of her to the imperi famili ha
declar that he will leav it to the french peopl themselv to choos
their own form of govern and i believ that onc free from the
usurp the whole nation will certainli throw itself into the arm
of it right king she conclud try to be amiabl to the
royalist emigr
that is doubt said princ andrew monsieur le vicomt quit
rightli suppos that matter have alreadi gone too far i think it will
be difficult to return to the old regim
from what i have heard said pierr blush and break into
the convers almost all the aristocraci ha alreadi gone over to
bonapart side
it is the buonapartist who sai that repli the vicomt without
look at pierr at the present time it is difficult to know the
real state of french public opinion
bonapart ha said so remark princ andrew with a sarcast
smile
it wa evid that he did not like the vicomt and wa aim hi
remark at him though without look at him
i show them the path to glori but thei did not follow
it princ andrew continu after a short silenc again quot
napoleon word i open my antechamb and thei crowd
in i do not know how far he wa justifi in sai so
not in the least repli the vicomt after the murder of the
duc even the most partial ceas to regard him as a hero if to some
peopl he went on turn to anna pvlovna he ever wa a hero
after the murder of the duc there wa on martyr more in heaven and on
hero less on earth
befor anna pvlovna and the other had time to smile their
appreci of the vicomt epigram pierr again broke into the
convers and though anna pvlovna felt sure he would sai someth
inappropri she wa unabl to stop him
the execut of the duc denghien declar monsieur pierr
wa a polit necess and it seem to me that napoleon
show great of soul by not fear to take on himself the whole
respons of that deed
dieu mon dieu mutter anna pvlovna in a terrifi whisper
what monsieur pierr do you consid that assassin show
great of soul said the littl princess smile and draw her
work nearer to her
oh oh exclaim sever voic
capit said princ hippolyt in english and began slap hi
knee with the palm of hi hand
the vicomt mere shrug hi shoulder pierr look solemnli at hi
audienc over hi spectacl and continu
i sai so he continu desper becaus the bourbon fled
from the revolut leav the peopl to anarchi and napoleon alon
understood the revolut and quell it and so for the gener good
he could not stop short for the sake of on man life
wont you come over to the other tabl suggest anna
pvlovna
but pierr continu hi speech without heed her
no cri he becom more and more eager napoleon is great
becaus he rose superior to the revolut suppress it abus
preserv all that wa good in itequ of citizenship and freedom
of speech and of the pressand onli for that reason did he obtain
power
ye if have obtain power without avail himself of it to
commit murder he had restor it to the right king i should have
call him a great man remark the vicomt
he could not do that the peopl onli gave him power that he might
rid them of the bourbon and becaus thei saw that he wa a great
man the revolut wa a grand thing continu monsieur pierr
betrai by thi desper and provoc proposit hi extrem
youth and hi wish to express all that wa in hi mind
what revolut and regicid a grand thing well after that
but wont you come to thi other tabl repeat anna pvlovna
rousseau contrat social said the vicomt with a toler
smile
i am not speak of regicid i am speak about idea
ye idea of robberi murder and regicid again interject an
iron voic
those were extrem no doubt but thei ar not what is most
import what is import ar the right of man emancip from
prejudic and equal of citizenship and all these idea napoleon
ha retain in full forc
liberti and equal said the vicomt contemptu as if at
last decid serious to prove to thi youth how foolish hi word
were highsound word which have long been discredit who doe
not love liberti and equal even our saviour preach liberti and
equal have peopl sinc the revolut becom happier on the
contrari we want liberti but buonapart ha destroi it
princ andrew kept look with an amus smile from pierr to the
vicomt and from the vicomt to their hostess in the first moment of
pierr outburst anna pvlovna despit her social experi wa
horrorstruck but when she saw that pierr sacrilegi word
had not exasper the vicomt and had convinc herself that it wa
imposs to stop him she ralli her forc and join the vicomt in
a vigor attack on the orat
but my dear monsieur pierr said she how do you explain the
fact of a great man execut a ducor even an ordinari man whoi
innoc and untri
i should like said the vicomt to ask how monsieur explain
the 18th brumair wa not that an impostur it wa a swindl and not
at all like the conduct of a great man
and the prison he kill in africa that wa horribl said the
littl princess shrug her shoulder
he a low fellow sai what you will remark princ hippolyt
pierr not know whom to answer look at them all and smile hi
smile wa unlik the halfsmil of other peopl when he smile
hi grave even rather gloomi look wa instantan replac by
anothera childlik kindli even rather silli look which seem to
ask forgiv
the vicomt who wa meet him for the first time saw clearli that
thi young jacobin wa not so terribl as hi word suggest all were
silent
how do you expect him to answer you all at onc said princ
andrew besid in the action of a statesman on ha to distinguish
between hi act as a privat person as a gener and as an emperor
so it seem to me
ye ye of cours pierr chime in pleas at the arriv of
thi reinforc
on must admit continu princ andrew that napoleon as a man
wa great on the bridg of arcola and in the hospit at jaffa where he
gave hi hand to the plaguestricken but but there ar other act
which it is difficult to justifi
princ andrew who had evid wish to tone down the awkward of
pierr remark rose and made a sign to hi wife that it wa time to
go
suddenli princ hippolyt start up make sign to everyon to attend
and ask them all to be seat began

war ha depriv me of on of the associ nearest my heart i mean
young nichola rostv who with hi enthusiasm could not bear to remain
inact and ha left the univers to join the armi i will confess to
you dear mari that in spite of hi extrem youth hi departur for
the armi wa a great grief to me thi young man of whom i spoke to you
last summer is so noblemind and full of that real youth which
on seldom find nowadai among our old men of twenti and particularli
he is so frank and ha so much heart he is so pure and poetic that
my relat with him transient as thei were have been on of the
sweetest comfort to my poor heart which ha alreadi suffer so much
somedai i will tell you about our part and all that wa said then
that is still too fresh ah dear friend you ar happi not to know
these poignant joi and sorrow you ar fortun for the latter ar
gener the stronger i know veri well that count nichola is too
young ever to be more to me than a friend but thi sweet friendship
thi poetic and pure intimaci were what my heart need but enough of
thi the chief new about which all moscow gossip is the death of
old count bezkhov and hi inherit fanci the three princess
have receiv veri littl princ vasli noth and it is monsieur
pierr who ha inherit all the properti and ha besid been
recogn as legitim so that he is now count bezkhov and
possessor of the finest fortun in russia it is rumor that princ
vasli plai a veri despic part in thi affair and that he
return to petersburg quit crestfallen
i confess i understand veri littl about all these matter of will and
inherit but i do know that sinc thi young man whom we all us
to know as plain monsieur pierr ha becom count bezkhov and the
owner of on of the largest fortun in russia i am much amus to
watch the chang in the tone and manner of the mamma burden by
marriag daughter and of the young ladi themselv toward
him though between you and me he alwai seem to me a poor sort
of fellow as for the past two year peopl have amus themselv
by find husband for me most of whom i dont even know the
matchmak chronicl of moscow now speak of me as the futur countess
bezkhova but you will understand that i have no desir for the post
propo of marriag do you know that a while ago that univers
aunti anna mikhylovna told me under the seal of strict secreci of
a plan of marriag for you it is neither more nor less than with princ
vasli son anatol whom thei wish to reform by marri him to
someon rich and distingu and it is on you that hi relat
choic ha fallen i dont know what you will think of it but
i consid it my duti to let you know of it he is said to be veri
handsom and a terribl scapegrac that is all i have been abl to find
out about him
but enough of gossip i am at the end of my second sheet of paper and
mamma ha sent for me to go and dine at the aprksin read the
mystic book i am send you it ha an enorm success here though
there ar thing in it difficult for the feebl human mind to grasp it

juli
ps let me have new of your brother and hi charm littl wife
the princess ponder awhil with a thought smile and her lumin
ey lit up so that her face wa entir transform then she suddenli
rose and with her heavi tread went up to the tabl she took a sheet of
paper and her hand move rapidli over it thi is the repli she wrote
also in french
dear and preciou friend your letter of the 13th ha given me great
delight so you still love me my romant juli separ of which
you sai so much that is bad doe not seem to have had it usual effect
on you you complain of our separ what then should i sai if i
dare complain i who am depriv of all who ar dear to me ah if
we had not religion to consol us life would be veri sad why do you
suppos that i should look sever on your affect for that young
man on such matter i am onli sever with myself i understand such
feel in other and if never have felt them i cannot approv of
them neither do i condemn them onli it seem to me that christian
love love of on neighbor love of on enemi is worthier
sweeter and better than the feel which the beauti ey of a
young man can inspir in a romant and love young girl like yourself
the new of count bezkhov death reach us befor your letter
and my father wa much affect by it he sai the count wa the last
repres but on of the great centuri and that it is hi own
turn now but that he will do all he can to let hi turn come as late as
possibl god preserv us from that terribl misfortun
i cannot agre with you about pierr whom i knew as a child he alwai
seem to me to have an excel heart and that is the qualiti i valu
most in peopl as to hi inherit and the part plai by princ
vasli it is veri sad for both ah my dear friend our divin
saviour word that it is easier for a camel to go through the
ey of a needl than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god ar
terribl true i piti princ vasli but am still more sorri for pierr
so young and burden with such richesto what temptat he will be
expos if i were ask what i desir most on earth it would be to be
poorer than the poorest beggar a thousand thank dear friend for the
volum you have sent me and which ha such success in moscow yet sinc
you tell me that among some good thing it contain other which our
weak human understand cannot grasp it seem to me rather useless to
spend time in read what is unintellig and can therefor bear
no fruit i never could understand the fond some peopl have for
confus their mind by dwell on mystic book that mere awaken
their doubt and excit their imagin give them a bent for
exagger quit contrari to christian simplic let us rather read
the epistl and gospel let us not seek to penetr what mysteri
thei contain for how can we miser sinner that we ar know the
terribl and holi secret of provid while we remain in thi flesh
which form an impenetr veil between us and the etern let us
rather confin ourselv to studi those sublim rule which our
divin saviour ha left for our guidanc here below let us try to
conform to them and follow them and let us be persuad that the less
we let our feebl human mind roam the better we shall pleas god who
reject all knowledg that doe not come from him and the less we seek
to fathom what he ha been pleas to conceal from us the sooner will
he vouchsaf it revel to us through hi divin spirit
my father ha not spoken to me of a suitor but ha onli told me that he
ha receiv a letter and is expect a visit from princ vasli in
regard to thi project of marriag for me i will tell you dear sweet
friend that i look on marriag as a divin institut to which we must
conform howev pain it mai be to me should the almighti lai
the duti of wife and mother upon me i shall try to perform them as
faithfulli as i can without disquiet myself by examin my feel
toward him whom he mai give me for husband
i have had a letter from my brother who announc hi speedi arriv
at bald hill with hi wife thi pleasur will be but a brief on
howev for he will leav us again to take part in thi unhappi war
into which we have been drawn god know how or why not onli where you
areat the heart of affair and of the worldi the talk all of
war even here amid fieldwork and the calm of naturewhich townsfolk
consid characterist of the countryrumor of war ar heard

chapter iii
on return from the review kutzov took the austrian gener into
hi privat room and call hi adjut ask for some paper
relat to the condit of the troop on their arriv and the
letter that had come from the archduk ferdinand who wa in command of
the advanc armi princ andrew bolknski came into the room with the
requir paper kutzov and the austrian member of the hofkriegsrath
were sit at the tabl on which a plan wa spread out
ah said kutzov glanc at bolknski as if by thi
exclam he wa ask the adjut to wait and he went on with the
convers in french
all i can sai gener said he with a pleasant eleg
of express and inton that oblig on to listen to each
deliber spoken word it wa evid that kutzov himself listen
with pleasur to hi own voic all i can sai gener is that if
the matter depend on my person wish the will of hi majesti the
emperor franci would have been fulfil long ago i should long
ago have join the archduk and believ me on my honour that to me
person it would be a pleasur to hand over the suprem command
of the armi into the hand of a better inform and more skill
generalof whom austria ha so manyand to lai down all thi heavi
respons but circumst ar sometim too strong for us
gener
and kutzov smile in a wai that seem to sai you ar quit at
liberti not to believ me and i dont even care whether you do or
not but you have no ground for tell me so and that is the whole
point
the austrian gener look dissatisfi but had no option but to repli
in the same tone
on the contrari he said in a querul and angri tone that
contrast with hi flatter word on the contrari your
excel particip in the common action is highli valu by
hi majesti but we think the present delai is depriv the splendid
russian troop and their command of the laurel thei have been
accustom to win in their battl he conclud hi evid
prearrang sentenc
kutzov bow with the same smile
but that is my convict and judg by the last letter with which
hi high the archduk ferdinand ha honor me i imagin that the
austrian troop under the direct of so skill a leader as gener
mack have by now alreadi gain a decis victori and no longer need
our aid said kutzov
the gener frown though there wa no definit new of an austrian
defeat there were mani circumst confirm the unfavor rumor
that were afloat and so kutzov suggest of an austrian victori
sound much like ironi but kutzov went on blandli smile with the
same express which seem to sai that he had a right to suppos
so and in fact the last letter he had receiv from mack armi
inform him of a victori and state strateg the posit of the
armi wa veri favor
give me that letter said kutzov turn to princ andrew
pleas have a look at itand kutzov with an iron smile
about the corner of hi mouth read to the austrian gener the
follow passag in german from the archduk ferdinand letter
we have fulli concentr forc of nearli seventi thousand men with
which to attack and defeat the enemi should he cross the lech also
as we ar master of ulm we cannot be depriv of the advantag of
command both side of the danub so that should the enemi not
cross the lech we can cross the danub throw ourselv on hi line
of commun recross the river lower down and frustrat hi
intent should he try to direct hi whole forc against our faith
alli we shall therefor confid await the moment when the imperi
russian armi will be fulli equip and shall then in conjunct with
it easili find a wai to prepar for the enemi the fate he deserv
kutzov sigh deepli on finish thi paragraph and look at the
member of the hofkriegsrath mildli and attent

when princ andrew left the palac he felt that all the interest

then particularli strong
bilbin wa a man of thirtyf a bachelor and of the same circl as
princ andrew thei had known each other previous in petersburg but

import post in vienna both the foreign minist and our ambassador
in vienna knew him and valu him he wa not on of those mani
diplomat who ar esteem becaus thei have certain neg qualiti

who like work knew how to do it and despit hi indol would
sometim spend a whole night at hi write tabl he work well

what do we i mean the austrian court care for your victori bring
us nice new of a victori by the archduk karl or ferdinand on
archduk as good as anoth as you know and even if it is onli
over a fire brigad of bonapart that will be anoth stori and

there wa not a trace of agit on hi face with delic ironi he
question princ andrew about the detail of hi interview with the
emperor about the remark he had heard at court concern the krem
affair and about some ladi thei both knew
chapter xiv
on novemb 1 kutzov had receiv through a spy new that the armi
he command wa in an almost hopeless posit the spy report that
the french after cross the bridg at vienna were advanc in
immens forc upon kutzov line of commun with the troop
that were arriv from russia if kutzov decid to remain at krem
napoleon armi of on hundr and fifti thousand men would cut him
off complet and surround hi exhaust armi of forti thousand and he
would find himself in the posit of mack at ulm if kutzov decid
to abandon the road connect him with the troop arriv from russia
he would have to march with no road into unknown part of the bohemian
mountain defend himself against superior forc of the enemi and
abandon all hope of a junction with buxhwden if kutzov decid
to retreat along the road from krem to olmtz to unit with the
troop arriv from russia he risk be forestal on that road
by the french who had cross the vienna bridg and encumb by hi
baggag and transport have to accept battl on the march against an
enemi three time as strong who would hem him in from two side
kutzov chose thi latter cours
the french the spy report have cross the vienna bridg were
advanc by forc march toward znaim which lai sixtysix mile
off on the line of kutzov retreat if he reach znaim befor the
french there would be great hope of save the armi to let the
french forestal him at znaim meant the exposur of hi whole armi to a
disgrac such as that of ulm or to utter destruct but to forestal
the french with hi whole armi wa imposs the road for the french
from vienna to znaim wa shorter and better than the road for the
russian from krem to znaim
the night he receiv the new kutzov sent bagratin vanguard
four thousand strong to the right across the hill from the kremsznaim
to the viennaznaim road bagratin wa to make thi march without
rest and to halt face vienna with znaim to hi rear and if he
succeed in forestal the french he wa to delai them as long as
possibl kutzov himself with all hi transport took the road to
znaim
march thirti mile that stormi night across roadless hill with hi
hungri illshod soldier and lose a third of hi men as straggler
by the wai bagratin came out on the viennaznaim road at hollabrnn
a few hour ahead of the french who were approach hollabrnn from
vienna kutzov with hi transport had still to march for some dai
befor he could reach znaim henc bagratin with hi four thousand
hungri exhaust men would have to detain for dai the whole enemi armi
that came upon him at hollabrnn which wa clearli imposs but
a freak of fate made the imposs possibl the success of the trick
that had place the vienna bridg in the hand of the french without
a fight led murat to try to deceiv kutzov in a similar wai meet
bagratin weak detach on the znaim road he suppos it to be
kutzov whole armi to be abl to crush it absolut he await
the arriv of the rest of the troop who were on their wai from vienna
and with thi object offer a three dai truce on condit that
both armi should remain in posit without move murat declar
that negoti for peac were alreadi proceed and that he
therefor offer thi truce to avoid unnecessari bloodsh count
nostitz the austrian gener occupi the advanc post believ
murat emissari and retir leav bagratin divis
expos anoth emissari rode to the russian line to announc the peac
negoti and to offer the russian armi the three dai truce
bagratin repli that he wa not author either to accept or refus
a truce and sent hi adjut to kutzov to report the offer he had
receiv
a truce wa kutzov sole chanc of gain time give
bagratin exhaust troop some rest and let the transport and
heavi convoi whose movement were conceal from the french advanc
if but on stage nearer znaim the offer of a truce gave the onli and
a quit unexpect chanc of save the armi on receiv the new
he immedi dispatch adjut gener wintzingerod who wa in
attend on him to the enemi camp wintzingerod wa not mere
to agre to the truce but also to offer term of capitul and
meanwhil kutzov sent hi adjut back to hasten to the utmost the
movement of the baggag train of the entir armi along the kremsznaim
road bagratin exhaust and hungri detach which alon
cover thi movement of the transport and of the whole armi had to
remain stationari in face of an enemi eight time as strong as itself
kutzov expect that the propos of capitul which were
in no wai bind might give time for part of the transport to pass
and also that murat mistak would veri soon be discov prove
correct as soon as bonapart who wa at schnbrunn sixteen mile
from hollabrnn receiv murat dispatch with the propos of a
truce and a capitul he detect a ruse and wrote the follow
letter to murat
schnbrunn 25th brumair 1805
at eight oclock in the morn

my advanc guard and have no right to arrang an armistic without my

confront on anoth as befor
chapter xvi
have ridden round the whole line from right flank to left princ
andrew made hi wai up to the batteri from which the staff offic had
told him the whole field could be seen here he dismount and stop
besid the farthest of the four unlimb cannon befor the gun an
artilleri sentri wa pace up and down he stood at attent when the
offic arriv but at a sign resum hi measur monoton pace
behind the gun were their limber and still farther back picket rope
and artillerymen bonfir to the left not far from the farthest
cannon wa a small newli construct wattl shed from which came the
sound of offic voic in eager convers
it wa true that a view over nearli the whole russian posit and the
greater part of the enemi open out from thi batteri just face
it on the crest of the opposit hill the villag of schn grabern
could be seen and in three place to left and right the french troop
amid the smoke of their campfir the greater part of whom were
evid in the villag itself and behind the hill to the left from
that villag amid the smoke wa someth resembl a batteri but it
wa imposs to see it clearli with the nake ey our right flank wa
post on a rather steep inclin which domin the french posit
our infantri were station there and at the farthest point the
dragoon in the center where tshin batteri stood and from which
princ andrew wa survei the posit wa the easiest and most
direct descent and ascent to the brook separ us from schn
grabern on the left our troop were close to a cops in which smoke
the bonfir of our infantri who were fell wood the french line wa
wider than our and it wa plain that thei could easili outflank us
on both side behind our posit wa a steep and deep dip make it
difficult for artilleri and cavalri to retir princ andrew took
out hi notebook and lean on the cannon sketch a plan of the
posit he made some note on two point intend to mention them to
bagratin hi idea wa first to concentr all the artilleri in the
center and secondli to withdraw the cavalri to the other side of the
dip princ andrew be alwai near the command in chief close
follow the mass movement and gener order and constantli studi
histor account of battl involuntarili pictur to himself the
cours of event in the forthcom action in broad outlin he
imagin onli import possibl if the enemi attack the right
flank he said to himself the kiev grenadi and the podlsk
chasseur must hold their posit till reserv from the center
come up in that case the dragoon could successfulli make a flank
counterattack if thei attack our center we have the center batteri
on thi high ground shall withdraw the left flank under it cover and
retreat to the dip by echelon so he reason all the time
he had been besid the gun he had heard the voic of the offic
distinctli but as often happen had not understood a word of what thei
were sai suddenli howev he wa struck by a voic come from the
shed and it tone wa so sincer that he could not but listen
no friend said a pleasant and as it seem to princ andrew a
familiar voic what i sai is that if it were possibl to know
what is beyond death none of us would be afraid of it that so
friend
anoth a younger voic interrupt him afraid or not you cant
escap it anyhow
all the same on is afraid oh you clever peopl said a third
manli voic interrupt them both of cours you artilleri men ar
veri wise becaus you can take everyth along with youvodka and
snack
and the owner of the manli voic evid an infantri offic
laugh
ye on is afraid continu the first speaker he of the
familiar voic on is afraid of the unknown that what it is
whatev we mai sai about the soul go to the sky we know there is
no sky but onli an atmospher
the manli voic again interrupt the artilleri offic
well stand us some of your herb vodka tshin it said
why thought princ andrew that the captain who stood up
in the sutler hut without hi boot he recogn the agreeabl
philosoph voic with pleasur
some herb vodka certainli said tshin but still to
conceiv a futur life
he did not finish just then there wa a whistl in the air nearer and
nearer faster and louder louder and faster a cannon ball as if it
had not finish sai what wa necessari thud into the ground near
the shed with super human forc throw up a mass of earth the ground
seem to groan at the terribl impact
and immedi tshin with a short pipe in the corner of hi mouth
and hi kind intellig face rather pale rush out of the shed
follow by the owner of the manli voic a dash infantri offic who
hurri off to hi compani button up hi coat as he ran

opposit in front of which larg mass of french were advanc
no on had given tshin order where and at what to fire but after
consult hi sergeant major zakharchnko for whom he had great
respect he had decid that it would be a good thing to set fire to the
villag veri good said bagratin in repli to the offic
report and began deliber to examin the whole battlefield extend
befor him the french had advanc nearest on our right below the
height on which the kiev regiment wa station in the hollow where the
rivulet flow the soulstir roll and crackl of musketri wa
heard and much farther to the right beyond the dragoon the offic of
the suit point out to bagratin a french column that wa outflank
us to the left the horizon bound by the adjac wood princ
bagratin order two battalion from the center to be sent to
reinforc the right flank the offic of the suit ventur to remark
to the princ that if these battalion went awai the gun would remain
without support princ bagratin turn to the offic and with hi
dull ey look at him in silenc it seem to princ andrew that the
offic remark wa just and that realli no answer could be made to
it but at that moment an adjut gallop up with a messag from the
command of the regiment in the hollow and new that immens mass
of the french were come down upon them and that hi regiment wa in
disord and wa retreat upon the kiev grenadi princ bagratin
bow hi head in sign of assent and approv he rode off at a walk to
the right and sent an adjut to the dragoon with order to attack the
french but thi adjut return half an hour later with the new that
the command of the dragoon had alreadi retreat beyond the dip in
the ground as a heavi fire had been open on him and he wa lose
men uselessli and so had hasten to throw some sharpshoot into the
wood
veri good said bagratin
as he wa leav the batteri fire wa heard on the left also and
as it wa too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there
himself princ bagratin sent zherkv to tell the gener in command
the on who had parad hi regiment befor kutzov at braunau that
he must retreat as quickli as possibl behind the hollow in the rear
as the right flank would probabl not be abl to withstand the enemi
attack veri long about tshin and the battalion that had been in
support of hi batteri all wa forgotten princ andrew listen
attent to bagratin colloqui with the command offic
and the order he gave them and to hi surpris found that no order

and a muffl shout almost behind them in the wood the french had
attack the men collect wood in the cops it wa no longer possibl
for the hussar to retreat with the infantri thei were cut off from

he had pierr at hand in moscow and procur for him an appoint as
gentleman of the bedchamb which at that time confer the statu of
councilor of state and insist on the young man accompani him to
petersburg and stai at hi hous with appar absentminded
yet with unhesit assur that he wa do the right thing
princ vasli did everyth to get pierr to marri hi daughter had
he thought out hi plan beforehand he could not have been so natur
and shown such unaffect familiar in intercours with everybodi both
abov and below him in social stand someth alwai drew him toward
those richer and more power than himself and he had rare skill in
seiz the most opportun moment for make us of peopl
pierr on unexpectedli becom count bezkhov and a rich man felt
himself after hi recent loneli and freedom from care so beset and
preoccupi that onli in bed wa he abl to be by himself he had to
sign paper to present himself at govern offic the purpos of

kind or with your excel heart you ar yourself so
honor count or were he as clever as you and so on
till he began sincer to believ in hi own except kind and
extraordinari intellig the more so as in the depth of hi heart it
had alwai seem to him that he realli wa veri kind and intellig
even peopl who had formerli been spite toward him and evid
unfriendli now becam gentl and affection the angri eldest
princess with the long waist and hair plaster down like a doll
had come into pierr room after the funer with droop ey
and frequent blush she told him she wa veri sorri about their past

grew still kinder the younger sister also becam affection to him
especi the youngest the pretti on with the mole who often made
him feel confus by her smile and her own confus when meet him
it seem so natur to pierr that everyon should like him and it
would have seem so unnatur had anyon dislik him that he could
not but believ in the sincer of those around him besid he had
no time to ask himself whether these peopl were sincer or not he
wa alwai busi and alwai felt in a state of mild and cheer
intox he felt as though he were the center of some import and
gener movement that someth wa constantli expect of him that if
he did not do it he would griev and disappoint mani peopl but if he
did thi and that all would be well and he did what wa demand of
him but still that happi result alwai remain in the futur
more than anyon els princ vasli took possess of pierr
affair and of pierr himself in those earli dai from the death of
count bezkhov he did not let go hi hold of the lad he had the air of
a man oppress by busi weari and suffer who yet would not for

that he ought to avoid her and go awai pierr despit that decis
had not left princ vasli and felt with terror that in peopl
ey he wa everi dai more and more connect with her that it wa
imposs for him to return to hi former concept of her that he
could not break awai from her and that though it would be a terribl
thing he would have to unit hi fate with her he might perhap have

alon in which there wa someth more signific than in the gener
smile that usual brighten her face pierr knew that everyon wa
wait for him to sai a word and cross a certain line and he knew that
sooner or later he would step across it but an incomprehens terror

mademoisel bourienn also rous to great excit by anatol
arriv thought in anoth wai of cours she a handsom young woman
without ani definit posit without relat or even a countri did
not intend to devot her life to serv princ bolknski to read
aloud to him and be friend with princess mari mademoisel
bourienn had long been wait for a russian princ who abl to
appreci at a glanc her superior to the plain badli dress
ungainli russian princess would fall in love with her and carri her
off and here at last wa a russian princ mademoisel bourienn knew
a stori heard from her aunt but finish in her own wai which she
like to repeat to herself it wa the stori of a girl who had been
seduc and to whom her poor mother sa pauvr mre appear and
reproach her for yield to a man without be marri mademoisel
bourienn wa often touch to tear as in imagin she told thi
stori to him her seduc and now he a real russian princ had
appear he would carri her awai and then sa pauvr mre would appear
and he would marri her so her futur shape itself in mademoisel
bourienn head at the veri time she wa talk to anatol about
pari it wa not calcul that guid her she did not even for a
moment consid what she should do but all thi had long been familiar
to her and now that anatol had appear it just group itself around
him and she wish and tri to pleas him as much as possibl
the littl princess like an old war hors that hear the trumpet
unconsci and quit forget her condit prepar for the
familiar gallop of coquetri without ani ulterior motiv or ani
struggl but with nave and lightheart gaieti
although in femal societi anatol usual assum the role of a man
tire of be run after by women hi vaniti wa flatter by the
spectacl of hi power over these three women besid that he wa
begin to feel for the pretti and provoc mademoisel bourienn
that passion anim feel which wa apt to master him with great
sudden and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless action
after tea the compani went into the sit room and princess mari wa
ask to plai on the clavichord anatol laugh and in high spirit
came and lean on hi elbow face her and besid mademoisel
bourienn princess mari felt hi look with a painfulli joyou emot
her favorit sonata bore her into a most intim poetic world and
the look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic but
anatol express though hi ey were fix on her refer not
to her but to the movement of mademoisel bourienn littl
foot which he wa then touch with hi own under the clavichord
mademoisel bourienn wa also look at princess mari and in her
love ey there wa a look of fear joi and hope that wa also new
to the princess
how she love me thought princess mari how happi i am now
and how happi i mai be with such a friend and such a husband husband
can it be possibl she thought not dare to look at hi face but
still feel hi ey gaze at her
in the even after supper when all were about to retir anatol
kiss princess mari hand she did not know how she found the
courag but she look straight into hi handsom face as it came near
to her shortsight ey turn from princess mari he went up and
kiss mademoisel bourienn hand thi wa not etiquett but
then he did everyth so simpli and with such assur mademoisel
bourienn flush and gave the princess a frighten look
what delicaci thought the princess is it possibl that
amli mademoisel bourienn think i could be jealou of her
and not valu her pure affect and devot to me she went up
to her and kiss her warmli anatol went up to kiss the littl
princess hand

well i will give you my hand to kiss not till then she said and
smilingli rais a finger at him she left the room
chapter v
thei all separ but except anatol who fell asleep as soon as he
got into bed all kept awak a long time that night
is he realli to be my husband thi stranger who is so kindy
kind that is the chief thing thought princess mari and fear which
she had seldom experienc came upon her she fear to look round it
seem to her that someon wa there stand behind the screen in the
dark corner and thi someon wa heth deviland he wa also thi
man with the white forehead black eyebrow and red lip
she rang for her maid and ask her to sleep in her room
mademoisel bourienn walk up and down the conservatori for a long
time that even vainli expect someon now smile at someon now
work herself up to tear with the imaginari word of her pauvr mre
rebuk her for her fall
the littl princess grumbl to her maid that her bed wa badli made
she could not lie either on her face or on her side everi posit wa
awkward and uncomfort and her burden oppress her now more than
ever becaus anatol presenc had vividli recal to her the time
when she wa not like that and when everyth wa light and gai she
sat in an armchair in her dress jacket and nightcap and kati sleepi
and dishevel beat and turn the heavi feather bed for the third
time mutter to herself
i told you it wa all lump and hole the littl princess
repeat i should be glad enough to fall asleep so it not my
fault and her voic quiver like that of a child about to cry
the old princ did not sleep either tkhon half asleep heard him
pace angrili about and snort the old princ felt as though he
had been insult through hi daughter the insult wa the more point
becaus it concern not himself but anoth hi daughter whom he
love more than himself he kept tell himself that he would consid
the whole matter and decid what wa right and how he should act but
instead of that he onli excit himself more and more
the first man that turn upsh forget her father and everyth
els run upstair and doe up her hair and wag her tail and is unlik
herself glad to throw her father over and she knew i should notic
it fr fr fr and dont i see that that idiot had ey onli for

pride enough to see it if she ha no pride for herself she might at
least have some for my sake she must be shown that the blockhead think
noth of her and look onli at bourienn no she ha no pride but
ill let her see
the old princ knew that if he told hi daughter she wa make a
mistak and that anatol meant to flirt with mademoisel bourienn
princess mari selfesteem would be wound and hi point not to
be part from her would be gain so pacifi himself with thi
thought he call tkhon and began to undress

at all as it realli wa rostv wa a truth young man and would on
no account have told a deliber lie he began hi stori mean to
tell everyth just as it happen but impercept involuntarili
and inevit he laps into falsehood if he had told the truth to hi
hearerswho like himself had often heard stori of attack and had
form a definit idea of what an attack wa and were expect to hear
just such a storythei would either not have believ him or still
wors would have thought that rostv wa himself to blame sinc what
gener happen to the narrat of cavalri attack had not happen
to him he could not tell them simpli that everyon went at a trot and
that he fell off hi hors and sprain hi arm and then ran as hard as
he could from a frenchman into the wood besid to tell everyth as
it realli happen it would have been necessari to make an effort of
will to tell onli what happen it is veri difficult to tell the truth
and young peopl ar rare capabl of it hi hearer expect a stori
of how besid himself and all aflam with excit he had flown like
a storm at the squar cut hi wai in slash right and left how hi
saber had tast flesh and he had fallen exhaust and so on and so he

halfclos ey he look at rostv bow slightli and wearili and
sat down languidli on the sofa he felt it unpleas to have drop
in on bad compani rostv flush up on notic thi but he did not
care thi wa a mere stranger glanc howev at bor he saw
that he too seem asham of the hussar of the line

berg took the opportun to ask with great polit whether as wa
rumor the allow of forag monei to captain of compani would be
doubl to thi princ andrew answer with a smile that he could
give no opinion on such an import govern order and berg laugh

stronger flow of love for hi sovereign he long to show that love in
some wai and know that thi wa imposs wa readi to cry the tsar

rostv too bend over hi saddl shout hurrah with all hi
might feel that he would like to injur himself by that shout if
onli to express hi raptur fulli
the tsar stop a few minut in front of the hussar as if undecid
how can the emperor be undecid thought rostv but then even
thi indecis appear to him majest and enchant like everyth
els the tsar did
that hesit last onli an instant the tsar foot in the narrow
point boot then fashion touch the groin of the bobtail bai
mare he rode hi hand in a white glove gather up the rein and he
move off accompani by an irregularli swai sea of aidesdecamp
farther and farther he rode awai stop at other regiment till at
last onli hi white plume were visibl to rostv from amid the suit

among the gentlemen of the suit rostv notic bolknski sit
hi hors indol and carelessli rostv recal their quarrel of
yesterdai and the question present itself whether he ought or ought
not to challeng bolknski of cours not he now thought is
it worth think or speak of it at such a moment at a time of such
love such raptur and such selfsacrific what do ani of our quarrel
and affront matter i love and forgiv everybodi now
when the emperor had pass nearli all the regiment the troop began
a ceremoni march past him and rostv on bedouin recent purchas

kutzov collect in group and began to talk about the award
about the austrian and their uniform about their line about
bonapart and how badli the latter would fare now especi if the
essen corp arriv and prussia took our side

everi word and movement wa describ with ecstasi
thei all had but on wish to advanc as soon as possibl against the
enemi under the emperor command command by the emperor himself
thei could not fail to vanquish anyon be it whom it might so thought
rostv and most of the offic after the review
all were then more confid of victori than the win of two battl
would have made them

purplefac gener wait respectfulli while captain princ andrew for

now center round the emperor so we will go to dolgorkov i have to
go there anyhow and i have alreadi spoken to him about you we shall
see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you
somewher nearer the sun
princ andrew alwai becam special keen when he had to guid a young
man and help him to worldli success under cover of obtain help
of thi kind for anoth which from pride he would never accept for
himself he kept in touch with the circl which confer success and
which attract him he veri readili took up bor caus and went
with him to dolgorkov
it wa late in the even when thei enter the palac at olmtz
occupi by the emperor and their retinu
that same dai a council of war had been held in which all the member of
the hofkriegsrath and both emperor took part at that council contrari
to the view of the old gener kutzov and princ schwartzenberg it
had been decid to advanc immedi and give battl to bonapart
the council of war wa just over when princ andrew accompani
by bor arriv at the palac to find dolgorkov everyon at
headquart wa still under the spell of the dai council at which
the parti of the young had triumph the voic of those who counsel
delai and advis wait for someth els befor advanc had been
so complet silenc and their argument confut by such conclus
evid of the advantag of attack that what had been discuss
at the councilth come battl and the victori that would certainli
result from itno longer seem to be in the futur but in the past
all the advantag were on our side our enorm forc undoubtedli
superior to napoleon were concentr in on place the troop
inspir by the emperor presenc were eager for action the
strateg posit where the oper would take place wa familiar in
all it detail to the austrian gener weyroth a lucki accid had
ordain that the austrian armi should maneuv the previou year on the
veri field where the french had now to be fought the adjac
local wa known and shown in everi detail on the map and bonapart

dolgorkov on of the warmest advoc of an attack had just
return from the council tire and exhaust but eager and proud
of the victori that had been gain princ andrew introduc hi
protg but princ dolgorkov polit and firmli press hi hand
said noth to bor and evid unabl to suppress the thought
which were uppermost in hi mind at that moment address princ andrew
in french
ah my dear fellow what a battl we have gain god grant that

detail no my dear fellow no condit better than our present on
could have been devis thi combin of austrian precis with

and do you know my dear fellow it seem to me that bonapart ha
decidedli lost bear you know that a letter wa receiv from him
todai for the emperor dolgorkov smile significantli
is that so and what did he sai inquir bolknski
what can he sai tradiridira and so on mere to gain time
i tell you he is in our hand that certain but what wa most
amus he continu with a sudden goodnatur laugh wa that
we could not think how to address the repli if not as consul

gener bonapart
but between not recogn him as emperor and call him gener
bonapart there is a differ remark bolknski
that just it interrupt dolgorkov quickli laugh
you know bilbinh a veri clever fellow he suggest
address him as usurp and enemi of mankind
dolgorkov laugh merrili

markv immedi drop hi own besid it and pick it up without

as a petition on behalf of thi young man you see but
befor princ andrew could finish an aidedecamp came in to summon

be veri glad to do all in my power both for you and for thi dear young
man again he press the hand of the latter with an express of
goodnatur sincer and anim leviti but you see anoth
time
bor wa excit by the thought of be so close to the higher power
as he felt himself to be at that moment he wa consciou that here
he wa in contact with the spring that set in motion the enorm
movement of the mass of which in hi regiment he felt himself a tini
obedi and insignific atom thei follow princ dolgorkov out
into the corridor and metcom out of the door of the emperor
room by which dolgorkov had entereda short man in civilian cloth
with a clever face and sharpli project jaw which without spoil
hi face gave him a peculiar vivac and shifti of express
thi short man nod to dolgorkov as to an intim friend and stare
at princ andrew with cool intens walk straight toward him and
evid expect him to bow or to step out of hi wai princ andrew
did neither a look of animos appear on hi face and the other
turn awai and went down the side of the corridor
who wa that ask bor

menth minist of foreign affair princ adam czartorski it
is such men as he who decid the fate of nation ad bolknski
with a sigh he could not suppress as thei pass out of the palac
next dai the armi began it campaign and up to the veri battl of
austerlitz bor wa unabl to see either princ andrew or dolgorkov
again and remain for a while with the ismylov regiment

reach wheel creak on their axl as the cog engag on anoth and
the revolv pullei whirr with the rapid of their movement but a
neighbor wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepar

catch it and obei the impuls that wheel begin to creak and join
in the common motion the result and aim of which ar beyond it ken
just as in a clock the result of the complic motion of innumer

princ andrew began to repli and to state hi own plan which might
have been as good as weyroth but for the disadvantag that

chapter xii
shortli after nine oclock that even weyroth drove with hi
plan to kutzov quarter where the council of war wa to be
held all the command of column were summon to the command in
chief and with the except of princ bagratin who declin to
come were all there at the appoint time
weyroth who wa in full control of the propos battl by hi
eager and brisk present a mark contrast to the dissatisfi
and drowsi kutzov who reluctantli plai the part of chairman and
presid of the council of war weyroth evid felt himself to be
at the head of a movement that had alreadi becom unrestrain he wa
like a hors run downhil har to a heavi cart whether he wa
pull it or be push by it he did not know but rush along at
headlong speed with no time to consid what thi movement might lead
to weyroth had been twice that even to the enemi picket
line to reconnoit person and twice to the emperor russian and
austrian to report and explain and to hi headquart where he had
dictat the disposit in german and now much exhaust he arriv
at kutzov
he wa evid so busi that he even forgot to be polit to the
command in chief he interrupt him talk rapidli and indistinctli
without look at the man he wa address and did not repli to
question put to him he wa bespatt with mud and had a piti
weari and distract air though at the same time he wa haughti and
selfconfid
kutzov wa occupi a nobleman castl of modest dimens near
ostralitz in the larg draw room which had becom the command
in chief offic were gather kutzov himself weyroth and the
member of the council of war thei were drink tea and onli await
princ bagratin to begin the council at last bagratin orderli
came with the new that the princ could not attend princ andrew came
in to inform the command in chief of thi and avail himself
of permiss previous given him by kutzov to be present at the
council he remain in the room
sinc princ bagratin is not come we mai begin said
weyroth hurriedli rise from hi seat and go up to the tabl on
which an enorm map of the environ of brnn wa spread out
kutzov with hi uniform unbutton so that hi fat neck bulg over
hi collar as if escap wa sit almost asleep in a low chair
with hi podgi old hand rest symmetr on it arm at the sound
of weyroth voic he open hi on ey with an effort
ye ye if you pleas it is alreadi late said he and nod
hi head he let it droop and again close hi ey
if at first the member of the council thought that kutzov wa
pretend to sleep the sound hi nose emit dure the read that
follow prove that the command in chief at that moment wa absorb
by a far more seriou matter than a desir to show hi contempt for
the disposit or anyth elseh wa engag in satisfi the
irresist human need for sleep he realli wa asleep weyroth with
the gestur of a man too busi to lose a moment glanc at kutzov and
have convinc himself that he wa asleep took up a paper and in
a loud monoton voic began to read out the disposit for the
impend battl under a head which he also read out
disposit for an attack on the enemi posit behind kobelnitz and
sokolnitz novemb 30 1805
the disposit were veri complic and difficult thei began as
follow
as the enemi left wing rest on wood hill and hi right
extend along kobelnitz and sokolnitz behind the pond that ar there
while we on the other hand with our left wing by far outflank hi
right it is advantag to attack the enemi latter wing especi
if we occupi the villag of sokolnitz and kobelnitz wherebi we
can both fall on hi flank and pursu him over the plain between
schlappanitz and the thuerassa forest avoid the defil of
schlappanitz and bellowitz which cover the enemi front for thi
object it is necessari that the first column march the second
column march the third column march and so on read
weyroth
the gener seem to listen reluctantli to the difficult disposit
the tall fairhair gener buxhwden stood lean hi back against
the wall hi ey fix on a burn candl and seem not to listen
or even to wish to be thought to listen exactli opposit weyroth
with hi glisten wideopen ey fix upon him and hi mustach
twist upward sat the ruddi milordovich in a militari pose hi
elbow turn outward hi hand on hi knee and hi shoulder
rais he remain stubbornli silent gaze at weyroth face
and onli turn awai hi ey when the austrian chief of staff finish
read then milordovich look round significantli at the other
gener but on could not tell from that signific look whether he
agre or disagre and wa satisfi or not with the arrang next
to weyroth sat count langeron who with a subtl smile that never left
hi typic southern french face dure the whole time of the read
gaze at hi delic finger which rapidli twirl by it corner
a gold snuffbox on which wa a portrait in the middl of on of the
longest sentenc he stop the rotari motion of the snuffbox rais
hi head and with inim polit lurk in the corner of hi
thin lip interrupt weyroth wish to sai someth but the
austrian gener continu to read frown angrili and jerk hi
elbow as if to sai you can tell me your view later but now be so
good as to look at the map and listen langeron lift hi ey with
an express of perplex turn round to milordovich as if seek
an explan but meet the latter impress but meaningless
gaze droop hi ey sadli and again took to twirl hi snuffbox
a geographi lesson he mutter as if to himself but loud enough
to be heard
przebyszwski with respect but dignifi polit held hi
hand to hi ear toward weyroth with the air of a man absorb in
attent dohktrov a littl man sat opposit weyroth with
an assidu and modest mien and stoop over the outspread map
conscienti studi the disposit and the unfamiliar local he
ask weyroth sever time to repeat word he had not clearli heard
and the difficult name of villag weyroth compli and dohktrov
note them down
when the read which last more than an hour wa over langeron again
brought hi snuffbox to rest and without look at weyroth or at
anyon in particular began to sai how difficult it wa to carri out
such a plan in which the enemi posit wa assum to be known
wherea it wa perhap not known sinc the enemi wa in movement
langeron object were valid but it wa obviou that their chief
aim wa to show gener weyrotherwho had read hi disposit with
as much selfconfid as if he were address school childrenthat
he had to do not with fool but with men who could teach him someth
in militari matter
when the monoton sound of weyroth voic ceas kutzov open
hi ey as a miller wake up when the soporif drone of the mill wheel
is interrupt he listen to what langeron said as if remark
so you ar still at that silli busi quickli close hi ey
again and let hi head sink still lower
langeron try as virul as possibl to sting weyroth vaniti
as author of the militari plan argu that bonapart might easili
attack instead of be attack and so render the whole of thi
plan perfectli worthless weyroth met all object with a firm and
contemptu smile evid prepar beforehand to meet all object
be thei what thei might
if he could attack us he would have done so todai said he
so you think he is powerless said langeron
he ha forti thousand men at most repli weyroth with the
smile of a doctor to whom an old wife wish to explain the treatment of
a case
in that case he is invit hi doom by await our attack said
langeron with a subtli iron smile again glanc round for support
to milordovich who wa near him
but milordovich wa at that moment evid think of anyth
rather than of what the gener were disput about
ma foi said he tomorrow we shall see all that on the
battlefield
weyroth again gave that smile which seem to sai that to him it wa
strang and ridicul to meet object from russian gener and to
have to prove to them what he had not mere convinc himself of but
had also convinc the sovereign emperor of
the enemi ha quench hi fire and a continu nois is heard from
hi camp said he what doe that mean either he is retreat
which is the onli thing we need fear or he is chang hi posit
he smile iron but even if he also took up a posit in
the thuerassa he mere save us a great deal of troubl and all our
arrang to the minutest detail remain the same
how is that began princ andrew who had for long been wait
an opportun to express hi doubt
kutzov here woke up cough heavili and look round at the
gener
gentlemen the disposit for tomorrowor rather for todai for
it is past midnightcannot now be alter said he you have
heard them and we shall all do our duti but befor a battl there is
noth more import he paus than to have a good sleep
he move as if to rise the gener bow and retir it wa past
midnight princ andrew went out
the council of war at which princ andrew had not been abl to
express hi opinion as he had hope to left on him a vagu and uneasi
impress whether dolgorkov and weyroth or kutzov langeron
and the other who did not approv of the plan of attack were
righth did not know but wa it realli not possibl for kutzov
to state hi view plainli to the emperor is it possibl that on
account of court and person consider ten of thousand of live
and my life my life he thought must be risk
ye it is veri like that i shall be kill tomorrow he
thought and suddenli at thi thought of death a whole seri of most
distant most intim memori rose in hi imagin he rememb
hi last part from hi father and hi wife he rememb the dai
when he first love her he thought of her pregnanc and felt sorri for
her and for himself and in a nervous emot and soften mood he
went out of the hut in which he wa billet with nesvtski and began
to walk up and down befor it
the night wa foggi and through the fog the moonlight gleam
mysteri ye tomorrow tomorrow he thought tomorrow
everyth mai be over for me all these memori will be no more none
of them will have ani mean for me tomorrow perhap even certainli
i have a presenti that for the first time i shall have to show all
i can do and hi fanci pictur the battl it loss the
concentr of fight at on point and the hesit of all the
command and then that happi moment that toulon for which he had
so long wait present itself to him at last he firmli and clearli
express hi opinion to kutzov to weyroth and to the emperor
all ar struck by the just of hi view but no on undertak to
carri them out so he take a regiment a divisionstipul that no
on is to interfer with hi arrangementslead hi divis to
the decis point and gain the victori alon but death and
suffer suggest anoth voic princ andrew howev did not
answer that voic and went on dream of hi triumph the disposit
for the next battl ar plan by him alon nomin he is onli an
adjut on kutzov staff but he doe everyth alon the next
battl is won by him alon kutzov is remov and he is appoint
well and then ask the other voic if befor that you ar
not ten time wound kill or betrai well what then
well then princ andrew answer himself i dont know
what will happen and dont want to know and cant but if i want
thiswant glori want to be known to men want to be love by them it
is not my fault that i want it and want noth but that and live onli
for that ye for that alon i shall never tell anyon but oh god
what am i to do if i love noth but fame and men esteem death

as mani person ar to mefath sister wifethos dearest to
meyet dread and unnatur as it seem i would give them all at

thought as he listen to voic in kutzov courtyard the voic

coachman wa teas kutzov old cook whom princ andrew knew
and who wa call tit he wa sai tit i sai tit

but on the left flank the column of infantri cavalri and artilleri
which were to be the first to descend the height to attack the french
right flank and drive it into the bohemian mountain accord to plan
were alreadi up and astir the smoke of the campfir into which thei
were throw everyth superflu made the ey smart it wa cold
and dark the offic were hurriedli drink tea and breakfast the
soldier munch biscuit and beat a tattoo with their feet to
warm themselv gather round the fire throw into the flame the
remain of shed chair tabl wheel tub and everyth that thei
did not want or could not carri awai with them austrian column guid
were move in and out among the russian troop and serv as herald
of the advanc as soon as an austrian offic show himself near
a command offic quarter the regiment began to move the
soldier ran from the fire thrust their pipe into their boot their
bag into the cart got their musket readi and form rank the
offic button up their coat buckl on their sword and pouch
and move along the rank shout the train driver and orderli
har and pack the wagon and ti on the load the adjut and
battalion and regiment command mount cross themselv gave
final instruct order and commiss to the baggag men
who remain behind and the monoton tramp of thousand of feet
resound the column move forward without know where and unabl
from the mass around them the smoke and the increas fog to see
either the place thei were leav or that to which thei were go
a soldier on the march is hem in and born along by hi regiment as
much as a sailor is by hi ship howev far he ha walk whatev
strang unknown and danger place he reach just as a sailor is
alwai surround by the same deck mast and rig of hi ship so
the soldier alwai ha around him the same comrad the same rank the
same sergeant major ivn mtrich the same compani dog jack and the
same command the sailor rare care to know the latitud in which
hi ship is sail but on the dai of battleheaven know how and
whencea stern note of which all ar consciou sound in the moral
atmospher of an armi announc the approach of someth decis
and solemn and awaken in the men an unusu curios on the dai of
battl the soldier excitedli try to get beyond the interest of their
regiment thei listen intent look about and eagerli ask concern
what is go on around them
the fog had grown so dens that though it wa grow light thei could
not see ten pace ahead bush look like gigant tree and level
ground like cliff and slope anywher on ani side on might
encount an enemi invis ten pace off but the column advanc
for a long time alwai in the same fog descend and ascend hill
avoid garden and enclosur go over new and unknown ground and
nowher encount the enemi on the contrari the soldier becam
awar that in front behind and on all side other russian column
were move in the same direct everi soldier felt glad to know that
to the unknown place where he wa go mani more of our men were go
too
there now the krski have also gone past wa be said in
the rank
it wonder what a lot of our troop have gather lad last
night i look at the campfir and there wa no end of them a regular
moscow
though none of the column command rode up to the rank or talk to
the men the command as we saw at the council of war were out of
humor and dissatisfi with the affair and so did not exert themselv
to cheer the men but mere carri out the order yet the troop
march gaili as thei alwai do when go into action especi to
an attack but when thei had march for about an hour in the dens fog
the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleas conscious
of some disloc and blunder spread through the rank how such
a conscious is commun is veri difficult to defin but it
certainli is commun veri sure and flow rapidli impercept
and irrepress as water doe in a creek had the russian armi been
alon without ani alli it might perhap have been a long time befor
thi conscious of mismanag becam a gener convict but as
it wa the disord wa readili and natur attribut to the stupid
german and everyon wa convinc that a danger muddl had been
occas by the sausag eater
why have we stop is the wai block or have we alreadi come up
against the french
no on cant hear them theyd be fire if we had
thei were in a hurri enough to start us and now here we stand in
the middl of a field without rhyme or reason it all those damn
german muddl what stupid devil
ye id send them on in front but no fear theyr crowd up
behind and now here we stand hungri
i sai shall we soon be clear thei sai the cavalri ar block the
wai said an offic
ah those damn german thei dont know their own countri
said anoth
what divis ar you shout an adjut ride up
the eighteenth
then why ar you here you should have gone on long ago now you
wont get there till even
what stupid order thei dont themselv know what thei ar
do said the offic and rode off
then a gener rode past shout someth angrili not in russian
tafalafa but what he jabber no on can make out said a
soldier mimick the gener who had ridden awai id shoot them
the scoundrel
we were order to be at the place befor nine but we havent got
halfwai fine order wa be repeat on differ side
and the feel of energi with which the troop had start began to
turn into vexat and anger at the stupid arrang and at the
german
the caus of the confus wa that while the austrian cavalri wa
move toward our left flank the higher command found that our center
wa too far separ from our right flank and the cavalri were all
order to turn back to the right sever thousand cavalri cross in
front of the infantri who had to wait
at the front an alterc occur between an austrian guid and a
russian gener the gener shout a demand that the cavalri should be
halt the austrian argu that not he but the higher command wa to
blame the troop meanwhil stood grow listless and dispirit after
an hour delai thei at last move on descend the hill the fog
that wa dispers on the hill lai still more dens below where thei
were descend in front in the fog a shot wa heard and then anoth
at first irregularli at vari intervalstratatatand then more
and more regularli and rapidli and the action at the goldbach stream
began
not expect to come on the enemi down by the stream and have
stumbl on him in the fog hear no encourag word from their
command and with a conscious of be too late spread through
the rank and abov all be unabl to see anyth in front or around
them in the thick fog the russian exchang shot with the enemi
lazili and advanc and again halt receiv no time order from
the offic or adjut who wander about in the fog in those unknown
surround unabl to find their own regiment in thi wai the action
began for the first second and third column which had gone down into
the vallei the fourth column with which kutzov wa stood on the
pratzen height
below where the fight wa begin there wa still thick fog on the
higher ground it wa clear but noth could be seen of what wa
go on in front whether all the enemi forc were as we suppos
six mile awai or whether thei were near by in that sea of mist no on
knew till after eight oclock
it wa nine oclock in the morn the fog lai unbroken like a sea
down below but higher up at the villag of schlappanitz where napoleon
stood with hi marshal around him it wa quit light abov him wa
a clear blue sky and the sun vast orb quiver like a huge hollow
crimson float on the surfac of that milki sea of mist the whole french
armi and even napoleon himself with hi staff were not on the far side
of the stream and hollow of sokolnitz and schlappanitz beyond which we
intend to take up our posit and begin the action but were on thi
side so close to our own forc that napoleon with the nake ey could
distinguish a mount man from on on foot napoleon in the blue cloak
which he had worn on hi italian campaign sat on hi small grai arab
hors a littl in front of hi marshal he gaze silent at the hill
which seem to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the russian
troop were move in the distanc and he listen to the sound of
fire in the vallei not a singl muscl of hi facewhich in those
dai wa still thinmov hi gleam ey were fix intent on
on spot hi predict were be justifi part of the russian
forc had alreadi descend into the vallei toward the pond and lake
and part were leav these pratzen height which he intend to attack
and regard as the kei to the posit he saw over the mist that in
a hollow between two hill near the villag of pratzen the russian
column their bayonet glitter were move continu in on
direct toward the vallei and disappear on after anoth into
the mist from inform he had receiv the even befor from the
sound of wheel and footstep heard by the outpost dure the night
by the disorderli movement of the russian column and from all
indic he saw clearli that the alli believ him to be far awai
in front of them and that the column move near pratzen constitut
the center of the russian armi and that that center wa alreadi
suffici weaken to be successfulli attack but still he did not
begin the engag
todai wa a great dai for himth anniversari of hi coron
befor dawn he had slept for a few hour and refresh vigor and
in good spirit he mount hi hors and rode out into the field
in that happi mood in which everyth seem possibl and everyth
succe he sat motionless look at the height visibl abov
the mist and hi cold face wore that special look of confid
selfcomplac happi that on see on the face of a boi happili
in love the marshal stood behind him not ventur to distract hi
attent he look now at the pratzen height now at the sun float

when the sun had entir emerg from the fog and field and mist were
aglow with dazzl lighta if he had onli await thi to begin the
actionh drew the glove from hi shape white hand made a sign
with it to the marshal and order the action to begin the marshal

and musketri ahead of him the fire grew louder and louder
in the fresh morn air were now heard not two or three musket shot
at irregular interv as befor follow by on or two cannon shot
but a roll of vollei of musketri from the slope of the hill befor
pratzen interrupt by such frequent report of cannon that sometim
sever of them were not separ from on anoth but merg into a
gener roar
he could see puff of musketri smoke that seem to chase on anoth
down the hillsid and cloud of cannon smoke roll spread
and mingl with on anoth he could also by the gleam of bayonet
visibl through the smoke make out move mass of infantri and narrow
line of artilleri with green caisson
rostv stop hi hors for a moment on a hillock to see what wa
go on but strain hi attent as he would he could not understand
or make out anyth of what wa happen there in the smoke men of
some sort were move about in front and behind move line of troop
but why whither and who thei were it wa imposs to make out
these sight and sound had no depress or intimid effect on him
on the contrari thei stimul hi energi and determin
go on go on give it them he mental exclaim at these sound
and again proceed to gallop along the line penetr farther and
farther into the region where the armi wa alreadi in action
how it will be there i dont know but all will be well thought
rostv
after pass some austrian troop he notic that the next part of the
line the guard wa alreadi in action
so much the better i shall see it close he thought
he wa ride almost along the front line a hand of men came
gallop toward him thei were our uhlan who with disord
rank were return from the attack rostv got out of their wai
involuntarili notic that on of them wa bleed and gallop on
that is no busi of mine he thought he had not ridden mani
hundr yard after that befor he saw to hi left across the whole
width of the field an enorm mass of cavalri in brilliant white
uniform mount on black hors trot straight toward him and
across hi path rostv put hi hors to full gallop to get out of the
wai of these men and he would have got clear had thei continu at the
same speed but thei kept increas their pace so that some of the
hors were alreadi gallop rostv heard the thud of their hoof
and the jingl of their weapon and saw their hors their figur and
even their face more and more distinctli thei were our hors guard
advanc to attack the french cavalri that wa come to meet them
the hors guard were gallop but still hold in their hors
rostv could alreadi see their face and heard the command
charg shout by an offic who wa urg hi thoroughbr to
full speed rostv fear to be crush or swept into the attack on
the french gallop along the front as hard as hi hors could go but
still wa not in time to avoid them
the last of the hors guard a huge pockmark fellow frown angrili
on see rostv befor him with whom he would inevit collid
thi guardsman would certainli have bowl rostv and hi bedouin over
rostv felt himself quit tini and weak compar to these gigant men
and hors had it not occur to rostv to flourish hi whip befor
the ey of the guardsman hors the heavi black hors sixteen
hand high shi throw back it ear but the pockmark guardsman
drove hi huge spur in violent and the hors flourish it tail
and extend it neck gallop on yet faster hardli had the hors
guard pass rostv befor he heard them shout hurrah and
look back saw that their foremost rank were mix up with some
foreign cavalri with red epaulet probabl french he could see noth
more for immedi afterward cannon began fire from somewher and
smoke envelop everyth
at that moment as the hors guard have pass him disappear in
the smoke rostv hesit whether to gallop after them or to go where
he wa sent thi wa the brilliant charg of the hors guard that
amaz the french themselv rostv wa horrifi to hear later that
of all that mass of huge and handsom men of all those brilliant
rich youth offic and cadet who had gallop past him on their
thousandrubl hors onli eighteen were left after the charg
why should i envi them my chanc is not lost and mayb i shall see
the emperor immedi thought rostv and gallop on
when he came level with the foot guard he notic that about them and
around them cannon ball were fly of which he wa awar not so
much becaus he heard their sound as becaus he saw uneasi on
the soldier face and unnatur warlik solemn on those of the
offic
pass behind on of the line of a regiment of foot guard he heard a
voic call him by name
rostv
what he answer not recogn bor
i sai weve been in the front line our regiment attack said
bor with the happi smile seen on the face of young men who have been
under fire for the first time
rostv stop
have you he said well how did it go
we drove them back said bor with anim grow talk
can you imagin it and he began describ how the guard have
taken up their posit and see troop befor them thought thei were
austrian and all at onc discov from the cannon ball discharg
by those troop that thei were themselv in the front line and had
unexpectedli to go into action rostv without hear bor to the
end spur hi hors
where ar you off to ask bor
with a messag to hi majesti
there he is said bor think rostv had said hi
high and point to the grand duke who with hi high shoulder
and frown brow stood a hundr pace awai from them in hi helmet
and hors guard jacket shout someth to a pale white
uniform austrian offic
but that the grand duke and i want the command in chief or the
emperor said rostv and wa about to spur hi hors
count count shout berg who ran up from the other side as eager
as bor count i am wound in my right hand and he show hi
bleed hand with a handkerchief ti round it and i remain at
the front i held my sword in my left hand count all our familyth
von bergshav been knight
he said someth more but rostv did not wait to hear it and rode
awai
have pass the guard and travers an empti space rostv to avoid
again get in front of the first line as he had done when the hors
guard charg follow the line of reserv go far round the place
where the hottest musket fire and cannonad were heard suddenli he
heard musket fire quit close in front of him and behind our troop
where he could never have expect the enemi to be
what can it be he thought the enemi in the rear of our armi
imposs and suddenli he wa seiz by a panic of fear for himself
and for the issu of the whole battl but be that what it mai
he reflect there is no ride round it now i must look for the
command in chief here and if all is lost it is for me to perish with
the rest
the forebod of evil that had suddenli come over rostv wa more and
more confirm the farther he rode into the region behind the villag of
pratzen which wa full of troop of all kind
what doe it mean what is it whom ar thei fire at who is
fire rostv kept ask as he came up to russian and austrian
soldier run in confus crowd across hi path
the devil know theyv kill everybodi it all up now
he wa told in russian german and czech by the crowd of fugit who
understood what wa happen as littl as he did
kill the german shout on
mai the devil take themth traitor
zum henker dies russen mutter a german
hang these russian
sever wound men pass along the road and word of abus scream
and groan mingl in a gener hubbub then the fire di down
rostv learn later that russian and austrian soldier had been fire
at on anoth
my god what doe it all mean thought he and here where at
ani moment the emperor mai see them but no these must be onli a
hand of scoundrel it will soon be over it cant be that it
cant be onli to get past them quicker quicker
the idea of defeat and flight could not enter rostv head though
he saw french cannon and french troop on the pratzen height just where
he had been order to look for the command in chief he could not
did not wish to believ that
chapter xviii
rostv had been order to look for kutzov and the emperor near the
villag of pratzen but neither thei nor a singl command offic

the farther he went the more disorgan thei were the highroad on
which he had come out wa throng with calch carriag of all
sort and russian and austrian soldier of all arm some wound and

everyon he could stop but got no answer from anyon
at last seiz a soldier by hi collar he forc him to answer
eh brother theyv all bolt long ago said the soldier
laugh for some reason and shake himself free
have left that soldier who wa evid drunk rostv stop the
hors of a batman or groom of some import personag and began to
question him the man announc that the tsar had been driven in a
carriag at full speed about an hour befor along that veri road and
that he wa danger wound
it cant be said rostv it must have been someon els
i saw him myself repli the man with a selfconfid smile of
deris i ought to know the emperor by now after the time iv

doubt it now rostv rode in the direct point out to him in which
he saw turret and a church what need to hurri what wa he now to sai

rostv consid and then went in the direct where thei said he
would be kill
it all the same now if the emperor is wound am i to try to
save myself he thought he rode on to the region where the greatest
number of men had perish in flee from pratzen the french had not
yet occupi that region and the russiansth uninjur and slightli
woundedhad left it long ago all about the field like heap of
manur on wellkept plowland lai from ten to fifteen dead and wound
to each coupl of acr the wound crept togeth in two and three
and on could hear their distress scream and groan sometim
feignedor so it seem to rostv he put hi hors to a trot to
avoid see all these suffer men and he felt afraidafraid not
for hi life but for the courag he need and which he knew would not
stand the sight of these unfortun
the french who had ceas fire at thi field strewn with dead and
wound where there wa no on left to fire at on see an adjut
ride over it train a gun on him and fire sever shot the
sensat of those terribl whistl sound and of the corps around
him merg in rostv mind into a singl feel of terror and piti
for himself he rememb hi mother last letter what would she
feel thought he if she saw me here now on thi field with the
cannon aim at me
in the villag of hosjeradek there were russian troop retir from
the field of battl who though still in some confus were less
disord the french cannon did not reach there and the musketri fire
sound far awai here everyon clearli saw and said that the battl
wa lost no on whom rostv ask could tell him where the emperor
or kutzov wa some said the report that the emperor wa wound wa
correct other that it wa not and explain the fals rumor that had
spread by the fact that the emperor carriag had realli gallop
from the field of battl with the pale and terrifi oberhofmarsch
count tolsti who had ridden out to the battlefield with other in
the emperor suit on offic told rostv that he had seen someon
from headquart behind the villag to the left and thither rostv
rode not hope to find anyon but mere to eas hi conscienc when
he had ridden about two mile and had pass the last of the russian
troop he saw near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it two men
on horseback face the ditch on with a white plume in hi hat seem
familiar to rostv the other on a beauti chestnut hors which
rostv fanci he had seen befor rode up to the ditch struck hi
hors with hi spur and give it the rein leap lightli over onli
a littl earth crumbl from the bank under the hors hind hoof
turn the hors sharpli he again jump the ditch and deferenti
address the horseman with the white plume evid suggest
that he should do the same the rider whose figur seem familiar
to rostv and involuntarili rivet hi attent made a gestur of
refus with hi head and hand and by that gestur rostv instantli
recogn hi lament and ador monarch
but it cant be he alon in the midst of thi empti field
thought rostv at that moment alexand turn hi head and rostv
saw the belov featur that were so deepli engrav on hi memori the
emperor wa pale hi cheek sunken and hi ey hollow but the charm
the mild of hi featur wa all the greater rostv wa happi
in the assur that the rumor about the emperor be wound were
fals he wa happi to be see him he knew that he might and even
ought to go straight to him and give the messag dolgorkov had order
him to deliv
but as a youth in love trembl is unnerv and dare not utter the
thought he ha dream of for night but look around for help or a
chanc of delai and flight when the longedfor moment come and he is
alon with her so rostv now that he had attain what he had long
for more than anyth els in the world did not know how to approach
the emperor and a thousand reason occur to him why it would be
inconveni unseemli and imposs to do so
what it is as if i were glad of a chanc to take advantag of
hi be alon and despond a strang face mai seem unpleas or
pain to him at thi moment of sorrow besid what can i sai to him
now when my heart fail me and my mouth feel dry at the mere sight
of him not on of the innumer speech address to the emperor
that he had compos in hi imagin could he now recal those
speech were intend for quit other condit thei were for the
most part to be spoken at a moment of victori and triumph gener
when he wa dy of wound and the sovereign had thank him for heroic

besid how can i ask the emperor for hi instruct for the right
flank now that it is nearli four oclock and the battl is lost

emperor at onc rode up to him offer hi servic and assist him
to cross the ditch on foot the emperor wish to rest and feel

and i might have been in hi place thought rostv and hardli
restrain hi tear of piti for the emperor he rode on in utter
despair not know where to or why he wa now ride
hi despair wa all the greater from feel that hi own weak wa
the caus of hi grief
he might not onli might but should have gone up to the sovereign it
wa a uniqu chanc to show hi devot to the emperor and he had not

etern and infinit in all hi attribut
he stop and remain silent for a long time
pierr could not and did not wish to break thi silenc
he exist but to understand him is hard the mason began again
look not at pierr but straight befor him and turn the leav
of hi book with hi old hand which from excit he could not keep
still if it were a man whose exist thou didst doubt i could
bring him to thee could take him by the hand and show him to thee but
how can i an insignific mortal show hi omnipot hi infin
and all hi merci to on who is blind or who shut hi ey that he mai
not see or understand him and mai not see or understand hi own vile
and sin he paus again who art thou thou dreamest that
thou art wise becaus thou couldst utter those blasphem word he
went on with a somber and scorn smile and thou art more foolish
and unreason than a littl child who plai with the part of a
skillfulli made watch dare to sai that as he doe not understand
it us he doe not believ in the master who made it to know him is
hard for ag from our forefath adam to our own dai we labor to

in our lack of understand we see onli our weak and hi
great
pierr listen with swell heart gaze into the mason face with
shine ey not interrupt or question him but believ with
hi whole soul what the stranger said whether he accept the wise
reason contain in the mason word or believ as a child

mason

reawaken he wa afraid of ani want of clear ani weak in
the mason argument he dread not to be abl to believ in him
i dont understand he said how it is that the mind of man
cannot attain the knowledg of which you speak
the mason smile with hi gentl fatherli smile
the highest wisdom and truth ar like the purest liquid we mai wish
to imbib he said can i receiv that pure liquid into an impur
vessel and judg of it puriti onli by the inner purif of myself
can i retain in some degre of puriti the liquid i receiv
ye ye that is so said pierr joyfulli
the highest wisdom is not found on reason alon not on those
worldli scienc of physic histori chemistri and the like into
which intellectu knowledg is divid the highest wisdom is on

scienc explain the whole creation and man place in it to
receiv that scienc it is necessari to purifi and renew on inner

word with vagu yet joy idea the door open and someon came in
by the dim light to which pierr had alreadi becom accustom he
saw a rather short man have evid come from the light into the
dark the man paus then move with cautiou step toward the
tabl and place on it hi small leatherglov hand
thi short man had on a white leather apron which cover hi chest and
part of hi leg he had on a kind of necklac abov which rose a high
white ruffl outlin hi rather long face which wa lit up from
below
for what have you come hither ask the newcom turn in
pierr direct at a slight rustl made by the latter why have
you who do not believ in the truth of the light and who have not
seen the light come here what do you seek from us wisdom virtu
enlighten
at the moment the door open and the stranger came in pierr felt a
sens of aw and vener such as he had experienc in hi boyhood at
confess he felt himself in the presenc of on social a complet
stranger yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man with bate
breath and beat heart he move toward the rhetor by which name the
brother who prepar a seeker for entranc into the brotherhood wa
known draw nearer he recogn in the rhetor a man he knew
smolyannov and it mortifi him to think that the newcom wa an
acquaintanceh wish him simpli a brother and a virtuou instructor
for a long time he could not utter a word so that the rhetor had to
repeat hi question
ye i i desir regener pierr utter with
difficulti
veri well said smolyannov and went on at onc have you ani
idea of the mean by which our holi order will help you to reach your
aim said he quietli and quickli
i hope for guidanc help in regener said pierr
with a trembl voic and some difficulti in utter due to hi
excit and to be unaccustom to speak of abstract matter in
russian
what is your concept of freemasonri
i imagin that freemasonri is the fratern and equal of men who
have virtuou aim said pierr feel asham of the inadequaci
of hi word for the solemn of the moment as he spoke i
imagin
good said the rhetor quickli appar satisfi with
thi answer have you sought for mean of attain your aim in
religion
no i consid it erron and did not follow it said pierr
so softli that the rhetor did not hear him and ask him what he wa
sai i have been an atheist answer pierr
you ar seek for truth in order to follow it law in your life
therefor you seek wisdom and virtu is that not so said the
rhetor after a moment paus
ye ye assent pierr
the rhetor clear hi throat cross hi glove hand on hi breast
and began to speak
now i must disclos to you the chief aim of our order he said
and if thi aim coincid with your you mai enter our brotherhood
with profit the first and chief object of our order the foundat on
which it rest and which no human power can destroi is the preserv
and hand on to poster of a certain import mysteri which
ha come down to us from the remotest ag even from the first mana
mysteri on which perhap the fate of mankind depend but sinc thi
mysteri is of such a natur that nobodi can know or us it unless he be
prepar by long and dilig selfpurif not everyon can hope
to attain it quickli henc we have a secondari aim that of prepar
our member as much as possibl to reform their heart to purifi and
enlighten their mind by mean hand on to us by tradit from those
who have striven to attain thi mysteri and therebi to render them
capabl of receiv it
by purifi and regener our member we try thirdli to improv
the whole human race offer it in our member an exampl of pieti
and virtu and therebi try with all our might to combat the evil which
swai the world think thi over and i will come to you again
to combat the evil which swai the world pierr repeat and a
mental imag of hi futur activ in thi direct rose in hi mind
he imagin men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago and he
address an edifi exhort to them he imagin to himself
viciou and unfortun peopl whom he would assist by word and deed
imagin oppressor whose victim he would rescu of the three
object mention by the rhetor thi last that of improv mankind
especi appeal to pierr the import mysteri mention by the
rhetor though it arous hi curios did not seem to him essenti
and the second aim that of purifi and regener himself did not
much interest him becaus at that moment he felt with delight that he
wa alreadi perfectli cure of hi former fault and wa readi for all
that wa good
half an hour later the rhetor return to inform the seeker of the
seven virtu correspond to the seven step of solomon templ
which everi freemason should cultiv in himself these virtu were
1 discret the keep of the secret of the order 2 obedi to
those of higher rank in the order 3 moral 4 love of mankind 5
courag 6 generos 7 the love of death
in the seventh place try by the frequent thought of death the
rhetor said to bring yourself to regard it not as a dread foe but
as a friend that free the soul grown weari in the labor of virtu
from thi distress life and lead it to it place of recompens and
peac
ye that must be so thought pierr when after these word the
rhetor went awai leav him to solitari medit it must be so
but i am still so weak that i love my life the mean of which is onli
now gradual open befor me but five of the other virtu which
pierr recal count them on hi finger he felt alreadi in hi
soul courag generos moral love of mankind and especi
obediencewhich did not even seem to him a virtu but a joi he now
felt so glad to be free from hi own lawless and to submit hi will
to those who knew the indubit truth he forgot what the seventh
virtu wa and could not recal it
the third time the rhetor came back more quickli and ask pierr
whether he wa still firm in hi intent and determin to submit to
all that would be requir of him
i am readi for everyth said pierr
i must also inform you said the rhetor that our order
deliv it teach not in word onli but also by other mean which
mai perhap have a stronger effect on the sincer seeker after wisdom
and virtu than mere word thi chamber with what you see therein
should alreadi have suggest to your heart if it is sincer more than
word could do you will perhap also see in your further initi a
like method of enlighten our order imit the ancient societi
that explain their teach by hieroglyph a hieroglyph said
the rhetor is an emblem of someth not cogniz by the sens
but which possess qualiti resembl those of the symbol
pierr knew veri well what a hieroglyph wa but dare not speak he
listen to the rhetor in silenc feel from all he said that hi
ordeal wa about to begin
if you ar resolv i must begin your initi said the rhetor
come closer to pierr in token of generos i ask you to give me
all your valuabl
but i have noth here repli pierr suppos that he wa
ask to give up all he possess
what you have with you watch monei ring
pierr quickli took out hi purs and watch but could not manag for
some time to get the wed ring off hi fat finger when that had been
done the rhetor said
in token of obedi i ask you to undress
pierr took off hi coat waistcoat and left boot accord to the
rhetor instruct the mason drew the shirt back from pierr
left breast and stoop down pull up the left leg of hi trouser
to abov the knee pierr hurriedli began take off hi right boot also
and wa go to tuck up the other trouser leg to save thi stranger the
troubl but the mason told him that wa not necessari and gave him
a slipper for hi left foot with a childlik smile of embarrass
doubt and selfderis which appear on hi face against hi will
pierr stood with hi arm hang down and leg apart befor hi
brother rhetor and await hi further command
and now in token of candor i ask you to reveal to me your chief
passion said the latter
my passion i have had so mani repli pierr
that passion which more than all other caus you to waver on the
path of virtu said the mason
pierr paus seek a repli
wine gluttoni idl lazi irrit anger women
he went over hi vice in hi mind not know to which of them to give
the preemin
women he said in a low scarc audibl voic
the mason did not move and for a long time said noth after thi
answer at last he move up to pierr and take the kerchief that lai
on the tabl again bound hi ey
for the last time i sai to youturn all your attent upon
yourself put a bridl on your sens and seek blessed not in
passion but in your own heart the sourc of blessed is not without
us but within
pierr had alreadi long been feel in himself that refresh sourc
of blessed which now flood hi heart with glad emot
chapter iv
soon after thi there came into the dark chamber to fetch pierr not
the rhetor but pierr sponsor willarski whom he recogn by hi
voic to fresh question as to the firm of hi resolut pierr
repli ye ye i agre and with a beam childlik smile

he wa told that he would now see the lesser light the bandag wa

apron like the rhetor and hold sword in their hand point at
hi breast among them stood a man whose white shirt wa stain with
blood on see thi pierr move forward with hi breast toward the
sword mean them to pierc it but the sword were drawn back from

now thou hast seen the lesser light utter a voic then the
candl were relit and he wa told that he would see the full light the
bandag wa again remov and more than ten voic said togeth sic

pierr gradual began to recov himself and look about at the room

chapter ix
bilbin wa now at armi headquart in a diplomat capac and
though he wrote in french and us french jest and french idiom
he describ the whole campaign with a fearless selfcensur and
selfderis genuin russian bilbin wrote that the oblig of
diplomat discret torment him and he wa happi to have in princ
andrew a reliabl correspond to whom he could pour out the bile he
had accumul at the sight of all that wa be done in the armi
the letter wa old have been written befor the battl at
preussischeylau
sinc the dai of our brilliant success at austerlitz wrote
bilbin as you know my dear princ i never leav headquart i
have certainli acquir a tast for war and it is just as well for me
what i have seen dure these last three month is incred
i begin ab ovo the enemi of the human race as you know
attack the prussian the prussian ar our faith alli who have
onli betrai us three time in three year we take up their caus but
it turn out that the enemi of the human race pai no heed to
our fine speech and in hi rude and savag wai throw himself on the
prussian without give them time to finish the parad thei had begun
and in two twist of the hand he break them to smithereen and instal
himself in the palac at potsdam
i most ardent desir write the king of prussia to
bonapart that your majesti should be receiv and treat in my
palac in a manner agreeabl to yourself and in so far as circumst
allow i have hasten to take all step to that end mai i have
succeed the prussian gener pride themselv on be polit to
the french and lai down their arm at the first demand
the head of the garrison at glogau with ten thousand men ask the
king of prussia what he is to do if he is summon to surrend all
thi is absolut true
in short hope to settl matter by take up a warlik attitud
it turn out that we have land ourselv in war and what is more
in war on our own frontier with and for the king of prussia we have
everyth in perfect order onli on littl thing is lack name
a command in chief as it wa consid that the austerlitz success
might have been more decis had the command in chief not been so
young all our octogenarian were review and of prozorvski
and kmenski the latter wa prefer the gener come to us
suvrovlik in a kibtka and is receiv with acclam of joi
and triumph
on the 4th the first courier arriv from petersburg the mail
ar taken to the field marshal room for he like to do everyth
himself i am call in to help sort the letter and take those meant
for us the field marshal look on and wait for letter address
to him we search but none ar to be found the field marshal grow
impati and set to work himself and find letter from the emperor
to count t princ v and other then he burst into on of hi wild
furi and rage at everyon and everyth seiz the letter open
them and read those from the emperor address to other ah so
that the wai thei treat me no confid in me ah order to keep
an ey on me veri well then get along with you so he write the
famou order of the dai to gener bennigsen
i am wound and cannot ride and consequ cannot command the
armi you have brought your armi corp to pultsk rout here it is
expos and without fuel or forag so someth must be done and as
you yourself report to count buxhwden yesterdai you must think of
retreat to our frontierwhich do todai
from all my ride he write to the emperor i have got a
saddl sore which come after all my previou journei quit prevent
my ride and command so vast an armi so i have pass on the
command to the gener next in senior count buxhwden have sent
him my whole staff and all that belong to it advis him if there is
a lack of bread to move farther into the interior of prussia for onli
on dai ration of bread remain and in some regiment none at all
as report by the divis command ostermann and sedmortzki and
all that the peasant had ha been eaten up i myself will remain in
hospit at ostrolenka till i recov in regard to which i humbl
submit my report with the inform that if the armi remain in it
present bivouac anoth fortnight there will not be a healthi man left
in it by spring
grant leav to retir to hi countri seat to an old man who is
alreadi in ani case dishonor by be unabl to fulfil the great and
gloriou task for which he wa chosen i shall await your most graciou
permiss here in hospit that i mai not have to plai the part of a
secretari rather than command in the armi my remov from the armi
doe not produc the slightest stira blind man ha left it there ar
thousand such as i in russia
the field marshal is angri with the emperor and he punish us all
isnt it logic
thi is the first act those that follow ar natur increasingli
interest and entertain after the field marshal departur
it appear that we ar within sight of the enemi and must give battl
buxhwden is command in chief by senior but gener bennigsen
doe not quit see it more particularli as it is he and hi corp who
ar within sight of the enemi and he wish to profit by the opportun
to fight a battl on hi own hand as the german sai he doe so
thi is the battl of pultsk which is consid a great victori but
in my opinion wa noth of the kind we civilian as you know have
a veri bad wai of decid whether a battl wa won or lost those who
retreat after a battl have lost it is what we sai and accord to
that it is we who lost the battl of pultsk in short we retreat
after the battl but send a courier to petersburg with new of a
victori and gener bennigsen hope to receiv from petersburg the
post of command in chief as a reward for hi victori doe not give up
the command of the armi to gener buxhwden dure thi interregnum
we begin a veri origin and interest seri of maneuv our aim is
no longer as it should be to avoid or attack the enemi but sole to
avoid gener buxhwden who by right of senior should be our chief
so energet do we pursu thi aim that after cross an unford
river we burn the bridg to separ ourselv from our enemi who at
the moment is not bonapart but buxhwden gener buxhwden wa all
but attack and captur by a superior enemi forc as a result of on
of these maneuv that enabl us to escap him buxhwden pursu
usw scuttl he hardli cross the river to our side befor we
recross to the other at last our enemi buxhwden catch us and
attack both gener ar angri and the result is a challeng on
buxhwden part and an epilept fit on bennigsen but at the
critic moment the courier who carri the new of our victori at
pultsk to petersburg return bring our appoint as command in
chief and our first foe buxhwden is vanquish we can now turn
our thought to the second bonapart but as it turn out just at
that moment a third enemi rise befor usnam the orthodox russian
soldier loudli demand bread meat biscuit fodder and whatnot
the store ar empti the road impass the orthodox begin loot
and in a wai of which our last campaign can give you no idea half the
regiment form band and scour the countrysid and put everyth
to fire and sword the inhabit ar total ruin the hospit
overflow with sick and famin is everywher twice the maraud even
attack our headquart and the command in chief ha to ask for a
battalion to dispers them dure on of these attack thei carri off
my empti portmanteau and my dress gown the emperor propos to give
all command of divis the right to shoot maraud but i much
fear thi will oblig on half the armi to shoot the other
at first princ andrew read with hi ey onli but after a while
in spite of himself although he knew how far it wa safe to trust
bilbin what he had read began to interest him more and more when he
had read thu far he crumpl the letter up and threw it awai it wa
not what he had read that vex him but the fact that the life out
there in which he had now no part could perturb him he shut hi ey
rub hi forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he
had read and listen to what wa pass in the nurseri suddenli he
thought he heard a strang nois through the door he wa seiz with
alarm lest someth should have happen to the child while he wa
read the letter he went on tipto to the nurseri door and open it
just as he went in he saw that the nurs wa hide someth from him
with a scare look and that princess mari wa no longer by the cot
my dear he heard what seem to him her despair whisper behind
him
as often happen after long sleepless and long anxieti he wa

chapter x
soon after hi admiss to the mason brotherhood pierr went to the
kiev provinc where he had the greatest number of serf take with
him full direct which he had written down for hi own guidanc as to
what he should do on hi estat
when he reach kiev he sent for all hi steward to the head offic
and explain to them hi intent and wish he told them that step
would be taken immedi to free hi serfsand that till then thei
were not to be overburden with labor women while nurs their babi
were not to be sent to work assist wa to be given to the serf
punish were to be admonitori and not corpor and hospit
asylum and school were to be establish on all the estat some of
the steward there were semiliter foremen among them listen with
alarm suppos these word to mean that the young count wa displeas
with their manag and embezzl of monei some after their first
fright were amus by pierr lisp and the new word thei had not
heard befor other simpli enjoi hear how the master talk while
the cleverest among them includ the chief steward understood from
thi speech how thei could best handl the master for their own end
the chief steward express great sympathi with pierr intent
but remark that besid these chang it would be necessari to go into
the gener state of affair which wa far from satisfactori
despit count bezkhov enorm wealth sinc he had come into an
incom which wa said to amount to five hundr thousand rubl a year
pierr felt himself far poorer than when hi father had made him
an allow of ten thousand rubl he had a dim percept of the
follow budget
about 80000 went in payment on all the estat to the land bank about
30000 went for the upkeep of the estat near moscow the town hous
and the allow to the three princess about 15000 wa given in
pension and the same amount for asylum 150000 alimoni wa sent to
the countess about 70000 went for interest on debt the build of a
new church previous begun had cost about 10000 in each of the last
two year and he did not know how the rest about 100000 rubl wa
spent and almost everi year he wa oblig to borrow besid thi the
chief steward wrote everi year tell him of fire and bad harvest
or of the necess of rebuild factori and workshop so the first
task pierr had to face wa on for which he had veri littl aptitud or
inclinationpract busi
he discuss estat affair everi dai with hi chief steward but
he felt that thi did not forward matter at all he felt that these
consult were detach from real affair and did not link up with
them or make them move on the on hand the chief steward put the state
of thing to him in the veri worst light point out the necess of
pai off the debt and undertak new activ with serf labor
to which pierr did not agre on the other hand pierr demand that
step should be taken to liber the serf which the steward met by
show the necess of first pai off the loan from the land bank
and the consequ imposs of a speedi emancip
the steward did not sai it wa quit imposs but suggest sell
the forest in the provinc of kostrom the land lower down the river
and the crimean estat in order to make it possibl all of which
oper accord to him were connect with such complic
measuresth remov of injunct petit permit and so
onthat pierr becam quit bewild and onli repli
ye ye do so
pierr had none of the practic persist that would have enabl him
to attend to the busi himself and so he dislik it and onli tri
to pretend to the steward that he wa attend to it the steward
for hi part tri to pretend to the count that he consid these
consult veri valuabl for the proprietor and troublesom to
himself
in kiev pierr found some peopl he knew and stranger hasten to make
hi acquaint and joyfulli welcom the rich newcom the
largest landown of the provinc temptat to pierr greatest
weaknessth on to which he had confess when admit to the
lodgewer so strong that he could not resist them again whole dai
week and month of hi life pass in as great a rush and were as much
occupi with even parti dinner lunch and ball give him
no time for reflect as in petersburg instead of the new life he had
hope to lead he still live the old life onli in new surround
of the three precept of freemasonri pierr realiz that he did not
fulfil the on which enjoin everi mason to set an exampl of moral
life and that of the seven virtu he lack twomor and the
love of death he consol himself with the thought that he fulfil
anoth of the preceptsthat of reform the human raceand had
other virtueslov of hi neighbor and especi generos
in the spring of 1807 he decid to return to petersburg on the wai he
intend to visit all hi estat and see for himself how far hi order
had been carri out and in what state were the serf whom god had
entrust to hi care and whom he intend to benefit
the chief steward who consid the young count attempt almost
insaneunprofit to himself to the count and to the serfsmad
some concess continu to repres the liber of the serf
as impractic he arrang for the erect of larg
buildingsschool hospit and asylumson all the estat
befor the master arriv everywher prepar were made not for
ceremoni welcom which he knew pierr would not like but for just
such gratefulli religi on with offer of icon and the bread
and salt of hospit as accord to hi understand of hi
master would touch and delud him
the southern spring the comfort rapid travel in a vienna
carriag and the solitud of the road all had a gladden effect on
pierr the estat he had not befor visit were each more picturesqu
than the other the serf everywher seem thrive and touchingli
grate for the benefit confer on them everywher were recept
which though thei embarrass pierr awaken a joy feel in the
depth of hi heart in on place the peasant present him with bread
and salt and an icon of saint peter and saint paul ask permiss
as a mark of their gratitud for the benefit he had confer on them
to build a new chantri to the church at their own expens in honor
of peter and paul hi patron saint in anoth place the women with
infant in arm met him to thank him for releas them from hard
work on a third estat the priest bear a cross came to meet
him surround by children whom by the count generos he wa
instruct in read write and religion on all hi estat pierr
saw with hi own ey brick build erect or in cours of erect
all on on plan for hospit school and almshous which were soon
to be open everywher he saw the steward account accord to
which the serf manori labor had been diminish and heard the
touch thank of deput of serf in their fullskirt blue
coat
what pierr did not know wa that the place where thei present him
with bread and salt and wish to build a chantri in honor of peter and
paul wa a market villag where a fair wa held on st peter dai
and that the richest peasant who form the deput had begun
the chantri long befor but that nine tenth of the peasant in that
villag were in a state of the greatest poverti he did not know that
sinc the nurs mother were no longer sent to work on hi land thei
did still harder work on their own land he did not know that the priest
who met him with the cross oppress the peasant by hi exact and
that the pupil parent wept at have to let him take their children
and secur their releas by heavi payment he did not know that the
brick build built to plan were be built by serf whose manori
labor wa thu increas though lessen on paper he did not know
that where the steward had shown him in the account that the serf
payment had been diminish by a third their obligatori manori work
had been increas by a half and so pierr wa delight with hi visit
to hi estat and quit recov the philanthrop mood in which
he had left petersburg and wrote enthusiast letter to hi
brotherinstructor as he call the grand master
how easi it is how littl effort it need to do so much good
thought pierr and how littl attent we pai to it
he wa pleas at the gratitud he receiv but felt abash at
receiv it thi gratitud remind him of how much more he might do
for these simpl kindli peopl
the chief steward a veri stupid but cun man who saw perfectli
through the nave and intellig count and plai with him as with
a toi see the effect these prearrang recept had on pierr
press him still harder with proof of the imposs and abov all
the useless of free the serf who were quit happi as it wa
pierr in hi secret soul agre with the steward that it would be
difficult to imagin happier peopl and that god onli knew what would
happen to them when thei were free but he insist though reluctantli
on what he thought right the steward promis to do all in hi power to
carri out the count wish see clearli that not onli would the
count never be abl to find out whether all measur had been taken for
the sale of the land and forest and to releas them from the land bank
but would probabl never even inquir and would never know that the
newli erect build were stand empti and that the serf continu
to give in monei and work all that other peopl serf gavethat is
to sai all that could be got out of them

beyond ceremoni and meaningless prayer and ar now instruct in
a comfort belief in futur life retribut recompens and
consol what evil and error ar there in it if peopl were dy
of diseas without help while materi assist could so easili be
render and i suppli them with a doctor a hospit and an asylum
for the ag and is it not a palpabl unquestion good if a
peasant or a woman with a babi ha no rest dai or night and i give
them rest and leisur said pierr hurri and lisp and
i have done that though badli and to a small extent but i have done
someth toward it and you cannot persuad me that it wa not a good
action and more than that you cant make me believ that you do not
think so yourself and the main thing is he continu that i
know and know for certain that the enjoy of do thi good is the
onli sure happi in life
ye if you put it like that it quit a differ matter said
princ andrew i build a hous and lai out a garden and you build
hospit the on and the other mai serv as a pastim but what
right and what good must be judg by on who know all but not by
us well you want an argument he ad come on then
thei rose from the tabl and sat down in the entranc porch which serv
as a veranda
come let argu then said princ andrew you talk of
school he went on crook a finger educ and so forth
that is you want to rais him point to a peasant who pass by
them take off hi cap from hi anim condit and awaken in him
spiritu need while it seem to me that anim happi is the onli
happi possibl and that is just what you want to depriv him of
i envi him but you want to make him what i am without give him my
mean then you sai lighten hi toil but as i see it physic
labor is as essenti to him as much a condit of hi exist as
mental activ is to you or me you cant help think i go to bed
after two in the morn thought come and i cant sleep but toss
about till dawn becaus i think and cant help think just as
he cant help plow and mow if he didnt he would go to the
drink shop or fall ill just as i could not stand hi terribl physic
labor but should die of it in a week so he could not stand my physic
idl but would grow fat and die the third thingwhat els wa
it you talk about and princ andrew crook a third finger ah
ye hospit medicin he ha a fit he is dy and you come and
bleed him and patch him up he will drag about as a crippl a burden to
everybodi for anoth ten year it would be far easier and simpler for
him to die other ar be born and there ar plenti of them as it is
it would be differ if you grudg lose a laborerthat how i
regard himbut you want to cure him from love of him and he doe not
want that and besid what a notion that medicin ever cure anyon
kill them ye said he frown angrili and turn awai from
pierr
princ andrew express hi idea so clearli and distinctli that it wa
evid he had reflect on thi subject more than onc and he spoke
readili and rapidli like a man who ha not talk for a long time hi
glanc becam more anim as hi conclus becam more hopeless
oh that is dread dread said pierr i dont
understand how on can live with such idea i had such moment
myself not long ago in moscow and when travel but at such time i
collaps so that i dont live at alleveryth seem hate to
me myself most of all then i dont eat dont wash and how is
it with you
why not wash that is not cleanli said princ andrew on the
contrari on must try to make on life as pleasant as possibl
im aliv that is not my fault so i must live out my life as best i
can without hurt other
but with such idea what motiv have you for live on would sit
without move undertak noth
life as it is leav on no peac i should be thank to do
noth but here on the on hand the local nobil have done me the
honor to choos me to be their marshal it wa all i could do to get
out of it thei could not understand that i have not the necessari
qualif for itth kind of goodnatur fussi shallow
necessari for the posit then there thi hous which must be

composur now there thi recruit my father is chief in
command of the third district and my onli wai of avoid activ
servic is to serv under him

why for thi reason my father is on of the most remark men of
hi time but he is grow old and though not exactli cruel he ha too
energet a charact he is so accustom to unlimit power that he is
terribl and now he ha thi author of a command in chief of
the recruit grant by the emperor if i had been two hour late
a fortnight ago he would have had a paymast clerk at ykhnovna
hang said princ andrew with a smile so i am serv becaus
i alon have ani influenc with my father and now and then can save him
from action which would torment him afterward
well there you see
ye but it is not as you imagin princ andrew continu i
did not and do not in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk
who had stolen some boot from the recruit i should even have been
veri glad to see him hang but i wa sorri for my fatherthat again
is for myself
princ andrew grew more and more anim hi ey glitter feverishli
while he tri to prove to pierr that in hi action there wa no
desir to do good to hi neighbor
there now you wish to liber your serf he continu that
is a veri good thing but not for youi dont suppos you ever had
anyon flog or sent to siberiaand still less for your serf if
thei ar beaten flog or sent to siberia i dont suppos thei ar
ani the wors off in siberia thei lead the same anim life and the
stripe on their bodi heal and thei ar happi as befor but it is
a good thing for proprietor who perish moral bring remors upon
themselv stifl thi remors and grow callou as a result of be
abl to inflict punish justli and unjustli it is those peopl i
piti and for their sake i should like to liber the serf you
mai not have seen but i have seen how good men brought up in those
tradit of unlimit power in time when thei grow more irrit
becom cruel and harsh ar consciou of it but cannot restrain
themselv and grow more and more miser
princ andrew spoke so earnestli that pierr could not help think
that these thought had been suggest to princ andrew by hi
father case
he did not repli
so that what im sorri forhuman digniti peac of mind
puriti and not the serf back and forehead which beat and shave
as you mai alwai remain the same back and forehead
no no a thousand time no i shall never agre with you said
pierr
chapter xii
in the even andrew and pierr got into the open carriag and drove to
bald hill princ andrew glanc at pierr broke the silenc now and
then with remark which show that he wa in a good temper
point to the field he spoke of the improv he wa make in
hi husbandri
pierr remain gloomili silent answer in monosyl and
appar immers in hi own thought
he wa think that princ andrew wa unhappi had gone astrai did not
see the true light and that he pierr ought to aid enlighten and
rais him but as soon as he thought of what he should sai he felt that
princ andrew with on word on argument would upset all hi teach
and he shrank from begin afraid of expos to possibl ridicul
what to him wa preciou and sacr
no but why do you think so pierr suddenli began lower hi
head and look like a bull about to charg why do you think so
you should not think so
think what about ask princ andrew with surpris
about life about man destini it cant be so i myself thought
like that and do you know what save me freemasonri no dont
smile freemasonri is not a religi ceremoni sect as i thought
it wa freemasonri is the best express of the best the etern
aspect of human
and he began to explain freemasonri as he understood it to princ
andrew he said that freemasonri is the teach of christian freed
from the bond of state and church a teach of equal brotherhood
and love
onli our holi brotherhood ha the real mean of life all the rest
is a dream said pierr understand my dear fellow that outsid
thi union all is fill with deceit and falsehood and i agre with you
that noth is left for an intellig and good man but to live out
hi life like you mere try not to harm other but make our
fundament convict your own join our brotherhood give yourself up

princ andrew look straight in front of him listen in silenc to
pierr word more than onc when the nois of the wheel prevent
hi catch what pierr said he ask him to repeat it and by the
peculiar glow that came into princ andrew ey and by hi silenc
pierr saw that hi word were not in vain and that princ andrew would
not interrupt him or laugh at what he said
thei reach a river that had overflow it bank and which thei had to
cross by ferri while the carriag and hors were be place on it
thei also step on the raft
princ andrew lean hi arm on the raft rail gaze silent at

time to repli took the repetit for a denial the more readili as he
knew princ andrew former atheist convict

could i and it cannot be seen if on look on our life here as the end
of everyth on earth here on thi earth pierr point to
the field there is no truth all is fals and evil but in the
univers in the whole univers there is a kingdom of truth and we who

everyth had been eaten up and the inhabit had all fledif ani
remain thei were wors than beggar and noth more could be taken
from them even the soldier usual pitiless enough instead of take
anyth from them often gave them the last of their ration
the pvlograd regiment had had onli two men wound in action but had
lost nearli half it men from hunger and sick in the hospit
death wa so certain that soldier suffer from fever or the swell
that came from bad food prefer to remain on duti and hardli abl
to drag their leg went to the front rather than to the hospit
when spring came on the soldier found a plant just show out of the

mshka sweet root it wa veri bitter but thei wander
about the field seek it and dug it out with their saber and at it

chapter iii
next morn have taken leav of no on but the count and not
wait for the ladi to appear princ andrew set off for home
it wa alreadi the begin of june when on hi return journei he drove
into the birch forest where the gnarl old oak had made so strang and
memor an impress on him in the forest the har bell sound
yet more muffl than thei had done six week befor for now all wa
thick shadi and dens and the young fir dot about in the forest
did not jar on the gener beauti but lend themselv to the mood
around were delic green with fluffi young shoot
the whole dai had been hot somewher a storm wa gather but onli
a small cloud had scatter some raindrop lightli sprinkl the road
and the sappi leav the left side of the forest wa dark in the shade
the right side glitter in the sunlight wet and shini and scarc
swai by the breez everyth wa in blossom the nightingal
trill and their voic reverber now near now far awai
ye here in thi forest wa that oak with which i agre thought
princ andrew but where is it he again wonder gaze at
the left side of the road and without recogn it he look with
admir at the veri oak he sought the old oak quit transfigur
spread out a canopi of sappi darkgreen foliag stood rapt and
slightli trembl in the rai of the even sun neither gnarl
finger nor old scar nor old doubt and sorrow were ani of them in
evid now through the hard centuryold bark even where there were
no twig leav had sprout such as on could hardli believ the old
veteran could have produc
ye it is the same oak thought princ andrew and all at onc he
wa seiz by an unreason springtim feel of joi and renew all
the best moment of hi life suddenli rose to hi memori austerlitz
with the lofti heaven hi wife dead reproach face pierr at
the ferri that girl thrill by the beauti of the night and that night
itself and the moon and all thi rush suddenli to hi mind
no life is not over at thirtyon princ andrew suddenli decid
final and decis it is not enough for me to know what i have
in meeveryon must know it pierr and that young girl who want to
fly awai into the sky everyon must know me so that my life mai not be
live for myself alon while other live so apart from it but so that
it mai be reflect in them all and thei and i mai live in harmoni
on reach home princ andrew decid to go to petersburg that autumn
and found all sort of reason for thi decis a whole seri of
sensibl and logic consider show it to be essenti for him
to go to petersburg and even to reenter the servic kept spring
up in hi mind he could not now understand how he could ever even have
doubt the necess of take an activ share in life just as a month
befor he had not understood how the idea of leav the quiet countri
could ever enter hi head it now seem clear to him that all hi
experi of life must be senselessli wast unless he appli it to
some kind of work and again plai an activ part in life he did not
even rememb how formerli on the strength of similar wretch logic
argument it had seem obviou that he would be degrad himself if
he now after the lesson he had had in life allow himself to believ
in the possibl of be us and in the possibl of happi
or love now reason suggest quit the opposit after that journei
to ryazn he found the countri dull hi former pursuit no longer
interest him and often when sit alon in hi studi he got up
went to the mirror and gaze a long time at hi own face then he would
turn awai to the portrait of hi dead lise who with hair curl la
grecqu look tenderli and gaili at him out of the gilt frame she
did not now sai those former terribl word to him but look simpli
merrili and inquisit at him and princ andrew cross hi
arm behind him long pace the room now frown now smile as
he reflect on those irrat inexpress thought secret as a
crime which alter hi whole life and were connect with pierr with
fame with the girl at the window the oak and woman beauti
and love and if anyon came into hi room at such moment he wa
particularli cold stern and abov all unpleasantli logic
my dear princess mari enter at such a moment would sai
littl nichola cant go out todai it veri cold
if it were hot princ andrew would repli at such time veri dryli
to hi sister he could go out in hi smock but as it is cold he
must wear warm cloth which were design for that purpos that is
what follow from the fact that it is cold and not that a child who
need fresh air should remain at home he would add with extrem
logic as if punish someon for those secret illog emot that
stir within him
at such moment princess mari would think how intellectu work dri
men up

reputationexpect to discov in him the perfect of human
qualiti
spernski told kochubi he wa sorri he had been unabl to come sooner
as he had been detain at the palac he did not sai that the emperor
had kept him and princ andrew notic thi affect of modesti
when kochubi introduc princ andrew spernski slowli turn
hi ey to bolknski with hi customari smile and look at him in
silenc
i am veri glad to make your acquaint i had heard of you as
everyon ha he said after a paus
kochubi said a few word about the recept arakchev had given

monsieur magntski he said fulli articul everi word and
syllabl and if you like i can put you in touch with him he
paus at the full stop i hope you will find him sympathet and
readi to cooper in promot all that is reason
a circl soon form round spernski and the old man who had talk
about hi subordin prynichnikov address a question to him
princ andrew without join in the convers watch everi movement
of spernski thi man not long sinc an insignific divin
student who now bolknski thought held in hi handsthos plump
white handsth fate of russia princ andrew wa struck by the
extraordinarili disdain composur with which spernski answer
the old man he appear to address condescend word to him from
an immeasur height when the old man began to speak too loud
spernski smile and said he could not judg of the advantag or
disadvantag of what pleas the sovereign
have talk for a littl while in the gener circl spernski rose
and come up to princ andrew took him along to the other end of the
room it wa clear that he thought it necessari to interest himself in
bolknski
i had no chanc to talk with you princ dure the anim
convers in which that vener gentleman involv me he said
with a mildli contemptu smile as if intim by that smile that he
and princ andrew understood the insignific of the peopl with whom
he had just been talk thi flatter princ andrew i have known
of you for a long time first from your action with regard to your
serf a first exampl of which it is veri desir that there should
be more imit and secondli becaus you ar on of those gentlemen
of the chamber who have not consid themselv offend by the new
decre concern the rank allot to courtier which is caus so
much gossip and tittletattl
no said princ andrew my father did not wish me to take
advantag of the privileg i began the servic from the lower grade
your father a man of the last centuri evid stand abov our
contemporari who so condemn thi measur which mere reestablish
natur justic
i think howev that these condemn have some ground
return princ andrew try to resist spernski influenc of
which he began to be consciou he did not like to agre with him in
everyth and felt a wish to contradict though he usual spoke easili
and well he felt a difficulti in express himself now while talk
with spernski he wa too much absorb in observ the famou
man person
ground of person ambit mayb spernski put in quietli
and of state interest to some extent said princ andrew
what do you mean ask spernski quietli lower hi ey
i am an admir of montesquieu repli princ andrew and
hi idea that le princip de monarchi est lhonneur me parat
incontest certain droit et privilg de la nobless me
paraiss tre de moyen de soutenir ce sentiment
the principl of monarchi is honor seem to me
incontest certain right and privileg for the
aristocraci appear to me a mean of maintain that
sentiment
the smile vanish from spernski white face which wa much
improv by the chang probabl princ andrew thought interest
him
si vou envisagez la question sou ce point de vue he began
pronounc french with evid difficulti and speak even slower
than in russian but quit calmli
if you regard the question from that point of view
spernski went on to sai that honor lhonneur cannot be upheld by
privileg harm to the servic that honor lhonneur is either a
neg concept of not do what is blameworthi or it is a sourc of
emul in pursuit of commend and reward which recogn it
hi argument were concis simpl and clear
an institut uphold honor the sourc of emul is on
similar to the lgion dhonneur of the great emperor napoleon not
harm but help to the success of the servic but not a class or
court privileg
i do not disput that but it cannot be deni that court privileg
have attain the same end return princ andrew everi courtier
consid himself bound to maintain hi posit worthili
yet you do not care to avail yourself of the privileg princ
said spernski indic by a smile that he wish to finish amiabl
an argument which wa embarrass for hi companion if you will
do me the honor of call on me on wednesdai he ad i will
after talk with magntski let you know what mai interest you and
shall also have the pleasur of a more detail chat with you
close hi ey he bow la franais without take leav and
try to attract as littl attent as possibl he left the room
chapter vi
dure the first week of hi stai in petersburg princ andrew felt the
whole trend of thought he had form dure hi life of seclus quit
overshadow by the trifl care that engross him in that citi
on return home in the even he would jot down in hi notebook four
or five necessari call or appoint for certain hour the mechan
of life the arrang of the dai so as to be in time everywher
absorb the greater part of hi vital energi he did noth did
not even think or find time to think but onli talk and talk
successfulli of what he had thought while in the countri
he sometim notic with dissatisfact that he repeat the same
remark on the same dai in differ circl but he wa so busi for
whole dai togeth that he had no time to notic that he wa think
of noth
as he had done on their first meet at kochubi spernski
produc a strong impress on princ andrew on the wednesdai when he
receiv him ttett at hi own hous and talk to him long and
confidenti
to bolknski so mani peopl appear contempt and insignific
creatur and he so long to find in someon the live ideal of that
perfect toward which he strove that he readili believ that in
spernski he had found thi ideal of a perfectli ration and virtuou
man had spernski sprung from the same class as himself and possess
the same breed and tradit bolknski would soon have discov
hi weak human unhero side but as it wa spernski strang
and logic turn of mind inspir him with respect all the more becaus
he did not quit understand him moreov spernski either becaus he
appreci the other capac or becaus he consid it necessari
to win him to hi side show off hi dispassion calm reason
befor princ andrew and flatter him with that subtl flatteri which
goe hand in hand with selfassur and consist in a tacit assumpt
that on companion is the onli man besid oneself capabl of
understand the folli of the rest of mankind and the reason
and profund of on own idea
dure their long convers on wednesdai even spernski more
than onc remark we regard everyth that is abov the common
level of root custom or with a smile but we want the wolv
to be fed and the sheep to be safe or thei cannot understand
thi and all in a wai that seem to sai we you and i
understand what thei ar and who we ar
thi first long convers with spernski onli strengthen in princ
andrew the feel he had experienc toward him at their first meet
he saw in him a remark clearthink man of vast intellect who by
hi energi and persist had attain power which he wa us sole
for the welfar of russia in princ andrew ey spernski wa the
man he would himself have wish to beon who explain all the fact
of life reason consid import onli what wa ration and
wa capabl of appli the standard of reason to everyth everyth
seem so simpl and clear in spernski exposit that princ
andrew involuntarili agre with him about everyth if he repli and
argu it wa onli becaus he wish to maintain hi independ and
not submit to spernski opinion entir everyth wa right
and everyth wa as it should be onli on thing disconcert princ
andrew thi wa spernski cold mirrorlik look which did not
allow on to penetr to hi soul and hi delic white hand which
princ andrew involuntarili watch as on doe watch the hand of
those who possess power thi mirrorlik gaze and those delic hand
irrit princ andrew he knew not why he wa unpleasantli
struck too by the excess contempt for other that he observ in
spernski and by the divers of line of argument he us to
support hi opinion he made us of everi kind of mental devic except
analog and pass too boldli it seem to princ andrew from on
to anoth now he would take up the posit of a practic man and
condemn dreamer now that of a satirist and laugh iron at hi
oppon now grow sever logic or suddenli rise to the realm of
metaphys thi last resourc wa on he veri frequent emploi
he would transfer a question to metaphys height pass on to
definit of space time and thought and have deduc the
refut he need would again descend to the level of the origin
discuss
in gener the trait of spernski mental which struck princ
andrew most wa hi absolut and unshak belief in the power and
author of reason it wa evid that the thought could never occur
to him which to princ andrew seem so natur name that it is
after all imposs to express all on think and that he had never
felt the doubt is not all i think and believ nonsens and
it wa just thi peculiar of spernski mind that particularli
attract princ andrew
dure the first period of their acquaint bolknski felt a
passion admir for him similar to that which he had onc felt for
bonapart the fact that spernski wa the son of a villag priest
and that stupid peopl might meanli despis him on account of hi
humbl origin as in fact mani did caus princ andrew to cherish hi
sentiment for him the more and unconsci to strengthen it
on that first even bolknski spent with him have mention the
commiss for the revis of the code of law spernski told him
sarcast that the commiss had exist for a hundr and fifti
year had cost million and had done noth except that rosenkampf
had stuck label on the correspond paragraph of the differ code
and that is all the state ha for the million it ha spent said
he we want to give the senat new jurid power but we have no
law that is why it is a sin for men like you princ not to serv in
these time
princ andrew said that for that work an educ in jurisprud wa
need which he did not possess
but nobodi possess it so what would you have it is a viciou
circl from which we must break a wai out
a week later princ andrew wa a member of the committe on armi
regul andwhat he had not at all expectedwa chairman of a
section of the committe for the revis of the law at spernski
request he took the first part of the civil code that wa be drawn up
and with the aid of the code napolon and the institut of justinian
he work at formul the section on person right
chapter vii
nearli two year befor thi in 1808 pierr on return to petersburg
after visit hi estat had involuntarili found himself in a lead
posit among the petersburg freemason he arrang dine and funer
lodg meet enrol new member and busi himself unit variou
lodg and acquir authent charter he gave monei for the erect
of templ and supplement as far as he could the collect of alm
in regard to which the major of member were stingi and irregular
he support almost singlehand a poorhous the order had found in
petersburg
hi life meanwhil continu as befor with the same infatu and
dissip he like to dine and drink well and though he consid
it immor and humili could not resist the temptat of the
bachelor circl in which he move
amid the turmoil of hi activ and distract howev pierr at
the end of a year began to feel that the more firmli he tri to rest
upon it the more mason ground on which he stood gave wai under him
at the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the
closer bound he involuntarili becam to the order when he had join
the freemason he had experienc the feel of on who confid
step onto the smooth surfac of a bog when he put hi foot down it
sank in to make quit sure of the firm of the ground he put
hi other foot down and sank deeper still becam stuck in it and
involuntarili wade kneedeep in the bog
joseph alexevich wa not in petersburgh had of late stood asid
from the affair of the petersburg lodg and live almost entir in
moscow all the member of the lodg were men pierr knew in ordinari
life and it wa difficult for him to regard them mere as brother in
freemasonri and not as princ b or ivn vaslevich d whom he knew
in societi mostli as weak and insignific men under the mason
apron and insignia he saw the uniform and decor at which thei
aim in ordinari life often after collect alm and reckon up
twenti to thirti rubl receiv for the most part in promis from a
dozen member of whom half were as well abl to pai as himself pierr
rememb the mason vow in which each brother promis to devot
all hi belong to hi neighbor and doubt on which he tri not to
dwell aros in hi soul
he divid the brother he knew into four categori in the first he
put those who did not take an activ part in the affair of the lodg
or in human affair but were exclus occupi with the mystic
scienc of the order with question of the threefold design of
god the three primordi elementssulphur mercuri and saltor
the mean of the squar and all the variou figur of the templ of
solomon pierr respect thi class of brother to which the elder on
chiefli belong includ pierr thought joseph alexevich himself
but he did not share their interest hi heart wa not in the mystic
aspect of freemasonri
in the second categori pierr reckon himself and other like him
seek and vacil who had not yet found in freemasonri a straight
and comprehens path but hope to do so
in the third categori he includ those brother the major who saw
noth in freemasonri but the extern form and ceremoni and prize
the strict perform of these form without troubl about their
purport or signific such were willarski and even the grand master
of the princip lodg
final to the fourth categori also a great mani brother belong
particularli those who had late join these accord to pierr
observ were men who had no belief in anyth nor desir for
anyth but join the freemason mere to associ with the wealthi
young brother who were influenti through their connect or rank
and of whom there were veri mani in the lodg
pierr began to feel dissatisfi with what he wa do freemasonri
at ani rate as he saw it here sometim seem to him base mere
on extern he did not think of doubt freemasonri itself but
suspect that russian masonri had taken a wrong path and deviat
from it origin principl and so toward the end of the year he went
abroad to be initi into the higher secret of the order
in the summer of 1809 pierr return to petersburg our freemason knew
from correspond with those abroad that bezkhov had obtain the
confid of mani highli place person had been initi into mani
mysteri had been rais to a higher grade and wa bring back with
him much that might conduc to the advantag of the mason caus
in russia the petersburg freemason all came to see him tri to
ingrati themselv with him and it seem to them all that he wa
prepar someth for them and conceal it
a solemn meet of the lodg of the second degre wa conven at
which pierr promis to commun to the petersburg brother what
he had to deliv to them from the highest leader of their order the
meet wa a full on after the usual ceremoni pierr rose and began
hi address
dear brother he began blush and stammer with a written
speech in hi hand it is not suffici to observ our mysteri in
the seclus of our lodgew must actact we ar drows but we
must act pierr rais hi notebook and began to read
for the dissemin of pure truth and to secur the triumph of
virtu he read we must cleans men from prejudic diffus
principl in harmoni with the spirit of the time undertak the
educ of the young unit ourselv in indissolubl bond with the
wisest men boldli yet prudent overcom superstit infidel and
folli and form of those devot to us a bodi link togeth by uniti
of purpos and possess of author and power
to attain thi end we must secur a preponder of virtu over vice
and must endeavor to secur that the honest man mai even in thi world
receiv a last reward for hi virtu but in these great endeavor we
ar grave hamper by the polit institut of todai what is
to be done in these circumst to favor revolut overthrow
everyth repel forc by forc no we ar veri far from that
everi violent reform deserv censur for it quit fail to remedi
evil while men remain what thei ar and also becaus wisdom need no
violenc
the whole plan of our order should be base on the idea of
prepar men of firm and virtu bound togeth by uniti of
convictionaim at the punish of vice and folli and patron
talent and virtu rais worthi men from the dust and attach
them to our brotherhood onli then will our order have the power
unobtrus to bind the hand of the protector of disord and to
control them without their be awar of it in a word we must found a
form of govern hold univers swai which should be diffus over
the whole world without destroi the bond of citizenship and besid
which all other govern can continu in their customari cours and
do everyth except what imped the great aim of our order which
is to obtain for virtu the victori over vice thi aim wa that of
christian itself it taught men to be wise and good and for their
own benefit to follow the exampl and instruct of the best and wisest
men
at that time when everyth wa plung in dark preach
alon wa of cours suffici the novelti of truth endow her with
special strength but now we need much more power method it is
now necessari that man govern by hi sens should find in virtu
a charm palpabl to those sens it is imposs to erad the
passion but we must strive to direct them to a nobl aim and it is
therefor necessari that everyon should be abl to satisfi hi passion
within the limit of virtu our order should provid mean to that end
as soon as we have a certain number of worthi men in everi state
each of them again train two other and all be close unit
everyth will be possibl for our order which ha alreadi in secret
accomplish much for the welfar of mankind
thi speech not onli made a strong impress but creat excit in
the lodg the major of the brother see in it danger design
of illumin met it with a cold that surpris pierr the grand
master began answer him and pierr began develop hi view with
more and more warmth it wa long sinc there had been so stormi a
meet parti were form some accus pierr of illumin other
support him at that meet he wa struck for the first time by
the endless varieti of men mind which prevent a truth from ever
present itself ident to two person even those member
who seem to be on hi side understood him in their own wai with
limit and alter he could not agre to as what he alwai
want most wa to convei hi thought to other just as he himself
understood it
the illuminati sought to substitut republican for
monarch institut
at the end of the meet the grand master with ironi and illwil
reprov bezkhov for hi vehem and said it wa not love of virtu
alon but also a love of strife that had move him in the disput
pierr did not answer him and ask briefli whether hi propos would
be accept he wa told that it would not and without wait for the
usual formal he left the lodg and went home
chapter viii
again pierr wa overtaken by the depress he so dread for three
dai after the deliveri of hi speech at the lodg he lai on a sofa at
home receiv no on and go nowher
it wa just then that he receiv a letter from hi wife who implor
him to see her tell him how griev she wa about him and how she
wish to devot her whole life to him
at the end of the letter she inform him that in a few dai she would
return to petersburg from abroad
follow thi letter on of the mason brother whom pierr respect
less than the other forc hi wai in to see him and turn the
convers upon pierr matrimoni affair by wai of fratern
advic express the opinion that hi sever to hi wife wa wrong
and that he wa neglect on of the first rule of freemasonri by not
forgiv the penit
at the same time hi motherinlaw princ vasli wife sent to
him implor him to come if onli for a few minut to discuss a most
import matter pierr saw that there wa a conspiraci against him and
that thei want to reunit him with hi wife and in the mood he then
wa thi wa not even unpleas to him noth matter to him
noth in life seem to him of much import and under the
influenc of the depress that possess him he valu neither hi
liberti nor hi resolut to punish hi wife
no on is right and no on is to blame so she too is not to
blame he thought
if he did not at onc give hi consent to a reunion with hi wife it
wa onli becaus in hi state of depress he did not feel abl to take
ani step had hi wife come to him he would not have turn her awai
compar to what preoccupi him wa it not a matter of indiffer
whether he live with hi wife or not
without repli either to hi wife or hi motherinlaw pierr late
on night prepar for a journei and start for moscow to see joseph
alexevich thi is what he note in hi diari
moscow 17th novemb
i have just return from my benefactor and hasten to write down what i
have experienc joseph alexevich is live poorli and ha for three

improv of the human race by strive for such purif which
is the princip aim of these three certainli selfreform and
selfpurif onli to thi aim can we alwai strive independ
of circumst but at the same time just thi aim demand the
greatest effort of us and so led astrai by pride lose sight of
thi aim we occupi ourselv either with the mysteri which in our
impur we ar unworthi to receiv or seek the reform of
the human race while ourselv set an exampl of base and
profligaci illumin is not a pure doctrin just becaus it is
attract by social activ and puf up by pride on thi ground
joseph alexevich condemn my speech and my whole activ and in the
depth of my soul i agre with him talk of my famili affair he said
to me the chief duti of a true mason as i have told you li in
perfect himself we often think that by remov all the difficulti

our three chief aim 1 selfknowledgefor man can onli know himself
by comparison 2 selfperfect which can onli be attain by
conflict and 3 the attain of the chief virtuelov of death
onli the vicissitud of life can show us it vaniti and develop our
innat love of death or of rebirth to a new life these word ar all

strang feel of perplex and fear her even and dinner parti
where polit poetri and philosophi were discuss at these parti
hi feel were like those of a conjuror who alwai expect hi trick
to be found out at ani moment but whether becaus stupid wa just
what wa need to run such a salon or becaus those who were deceiv

and constraint wa evid as if thei were asham of not have love
vra suffici and of be so readi to get her off their hand the
old count felt thi most he would probabl have been unabl to state

sinc bor left moscow in 1805 to join the armi he had not seen the
rostv he had been in moscow sever time and had pass near
otrdno but had never been to see them
sometim it occur to natsha that he did not wish to see her and
thi conjectur wa confirm by the sad tone in which her elder spoke
of him
nowadai old friend ar not rememb the countess would sai
when bor wa mention
anna mikhylovna also had of late visit them less frequent seem
to hold herself with particular digniti and alwai spoke raptur
and gratefulli of the merit of her son and the brilliant career on

on them
he drove to their hous in some agit the memori of natsha wa
hi most poetic recollect but he went with the firm intent of

himself and natsha could not be bind either on her or on him he
had a brilliant posit in societi thank to hi intimaci with countess
bezkhova a brilliant posit in the servic thank to the patronag
of an import personag whose complet confid he enjoi and he
wa begin to make plan for marri on of the richest heiress in

the rostv draw room natsha wa in her own room when she
heard of hi arriv she almost ran into the draw room flush and
beam with a more than cordial smile
bor rememb natsha in a short dress with dark ey shine from

four year befor and so he wa taken aback when quit a differ
natsha enter and hi face express raptur astonish thi

countess
bor kiss natsha hand and said that he wa astonish at the
chang in her
how handsom you have grown
i should think so repli natsha laugh ey
and is papa older she ask

feel becaus to marri her a girl almost without fortun would
mean ruin to hi career while to renew their former relat without
intend to marri her would be dishonor bor made up hi mind
to avoid meet natsha but despit that resolut he call again
a few dai later and began call often and spend whole dai at the
rostv it seem to him that he ought to have an explan with
natsha and tell her that the old time must be forgotten that in

it would all end he left off visit hlne and receiv reproach
note from her everi dai and yet he continu to spend whole dai with
the rostv

mysteri and fascin in spernski suddenli becam plain and
unattract
at dinner the convers did not ceas for a moment and seem to
consist of the content of a book of funni anecdot befor magntski
had finish hi stori someon els wa anxiou to relat someth
still funnier most of the anecdot if not relat to the state
servic relat to peopl in the servic it seem that in thi

that the onli possibl attitud toward them wa on of good humor
ridicul spernski relat how at the council that morn a deaf

not jest with them
there wa noth wrong or unseemli in what thei said it wa witti and

after dinner spernski daughter and her gover rose he pat

chapter xxv
dure that year after hi son departur princ nichola
bolknski health and temper becam much wors he grew still more
irrit and it wa princess mari who gener bore the brunt of hi
frequent fit of unprovok anger he seem carefulli to seek out
her tender spot so as to tortur her mental as harshli as possibl
princess mari had two passion and consequ two joysher nephew
littl nichola and religionand these were the favorit subject
of the princ attack and ridicul whatev wa spoken of he would
bring round to the superstiti of old maid or the pet
and spoil of children you want to make himlittl
nicholasinto an old maid like yourself a piti princ andrew
want a son and not an old maid he would sai or turn to
mademoisel bourienn he would ask her in princess mari presenc
how she like our villag priest and icon and would joke about them
he continu hurt princess mari feel and torment her but it
cost her no effort to forgiv him could he be to blame toward her or
could her father whom she knew love her in spite of it all be unjust
and what is justic the princess never thought of that proud word
justic all the complex law of man center for her in on clear
and simpl lawth law of love and selfsacrific taught us by him who
lovingli suffer for mankind though he himself wa god what had she to
do with the justic or injustic of other peopl she had to endur and
love and that she did
dure the winter princ andrew had come to bald hill and had been gai
gentl and more affection than princess mari had known him for a
long time past she felt that someth had happen to him but he said
noth to her about hi love befor he left he had a long talk with
hi father about someth and princess mari notic that befor hi
departur thei were dissatisfi with on anoth
soon after princ andrew had gone princess mari wrote to her friend
juli kargina in petersburg whom she had dream as all girl dream
of marri to her brother and who wa at that time in mourn for her
own brother kill in turkei
sorrow it seem is our common lot my dear tender friend juli
your loss is so terribl that i can onli explain it to myself as a
special provid of god who love you wish to try you and your
excel mother oh my friend religion and religion alon cani
will not sai comfort usbut save us from despair religion alon can
explain to us what without it help man cannot comprehend why for what
caus kind and nobl be abl to find happi in lifenot mere
harm no on but necessari to the happi of othersar call
awai to god while cruel useless harm person or such as ar a
burden to themselv and to other ar left live the first death i
saw and on i shall never forgetthat of my dear sisterinlawleft
that impress on me just as you ask destini why your splendid brother
had to die so i ask why that angel lise who not onli never wrong
anyon but in whose soul there were never ani unkind thought had to
die and what do you think dear friend five year have pass sinc
then and alreadi i with my petti understand begin to see clearli
why she had to die and in what wai that death wa but an express
of the infinit good of the creator whose everi action though
gener incomprehens to us is but a manifest of hi infinit
love for hi creatur perhap i often think she wa too angel
innoc to have the strength to perform all a mother duti as a
young wife she wa irreproach perhap she could not have been so
as a mother as it is not onli ha she left us and particularli princ
andrew with the purest regret and memori but probabl she will
there receiv a place i dare not hope for myself but not to speak of
her alon that earli and terribl death ha had the most benefic
influenc on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief then at
the moment of our loss these thought could not occur to me i should
then have dismiss them with horror but now thei ar veri clear and
certain i write all thi to you dear friend onli to convinc you
of the gospel truth which ha becom for me a principl of life not
a singl hair of our head will fall without hi will and hi will is
govern onli by infinit love for us and so whatev befal us is for
our good
you ask whether we shall spend next winter in moscow in spite of my
wish to see you i do not think so and do not want to do so you will
be surpris to hear that the reason for thi is buonapart the case is
thi my father health is grow notic wors he cannot stand
ani contradict and is becom irrit thi irrit is as
you know chiefli direct to polit question he cannot endur
the notion that buonapart is negoti on equal term with all the
sovereign of europ and particularli with our own the grandson of the
great catherin as you know i am quit indiffer to polit but
from my father remark and hi talk with michael ivnovich i know
all that goe on in the world and especi about the honor confer
on buonapart who onli at bald hill in the whole world it seem is
not accept as a great man still less as emperor of franc and my
father cannot stand thi it seem to me that it is chiefli becaus of
hi polit view that my father is reluct to speak of go to
moscow for he forese the encount that would result from hi wai
of express hi view regardless of anybodi all the benefit he might
deriv from a cours of treatment he would lose as a result of the
disput about buonapart which would be inevit in ani case it will
be decid veri shortli
our famili life goe on in the old wai except for my brother andrew
absenc he as i wrote you befor ha chang veri much of late after
hi sorrow he onli thi year quit recov hi spirit he ha again
becom as i us to know him when a child kind affection with that
heart of gold to which i know no equal he ha realiz it seem to me
that life is not over for him but togeth with thi mental chang
he ha grown physic much weaker he ha becom thinner and more
nervou i am anxiou about him and glad he is take thi trip abroad
which the doctor recommend long ago i hope it will cure him you
write that in petersburg he is spoken of as on of the most activ
cultiv and capabl of the young men forgiv my vaniti as a
relat but i never doubt it the good he ha done to everybodi
here from hi peasant up to the gentri is incalcul on hi
arriv in petersburg he receiv onli hi due i alwai wonder at the
wai rumor fly from petersburg to moscow especi such fals on as
that you write abouti mean the report of my brother betroth to
the littl rostva i do not think my brother will ever marri again
and certainli not her and thi is why first i know that though he
rare speak about the wife he ha lost the grief of that loss
ha gone too deep in hi heart for him ever to decid to give her a
successor and our littl angel a stepmoth secondli becaus as far
as i know that girl is not the kind of girl who could pleas princ
andrew i do not think he would choos her for a wife and frankli i do
not wish it but i am run on too long and am at the end of my second
sheet goodbi my dear friend mai god keep you in hi holi and mighti
care my dear friend mademoisel bourienn send you kiss

nichola rostv experienc thi bliss condit to the full when
after 1807 he continu to serv in the pvlograd regiment in which

sooner or later he would have to reenter that whirlpool of life with
it embarrass and affair to be straighten out it account

snya love and hi promis to her it wa all dreadfulli difficult
and complic and he repli to hi mother in cold formal letter

letter from hi parent in which thei told him of natsha
engag to bolknski and that the wed would be in a year
time becaus the old princ made difficulti thi letter griev and
mortifi nichola in the first place he wa sorri that natsha for
whom he care more than for anyon els in the famili should be lost to
the home and secondli from hi hussar point of view he regret not
to have been there to show that fellow bolknski that connect with
him wa no such great honor after all and that if he love natsha he
might dispens with permiss from hi dotard father for a moment he
hesit whether he should not appli for leav in order to see natsha
befor she wa marri but then came the maneuv and consider
about snya and about the confus of their affair and nichola
again put it off but in the spring of that year he receiv a letter
from hi mother written without hi father knowledg and that
letter persuad him to return she wrote that if he did not come and
take matter in hand their whole properti would be sold by auction and
thei would all have to go beg the count wa so weak and trust
mtenka so much and wa so goodnatur that everybodi took advantag

grai stallion that had not been ridden for a long time and when
he return with the hors all in a lather he inform lavrshka
densov servant who had remain with him and hi comrad who

hi three roan and dozhoyvyko hi quartermast and to wonder
anxious how thing would be at otrdno and what he would find
there thought of home grew stronger the nearer he approach itfar
stronger as though thi feel of hi wa subject to the law by which
the forc of attract is in invers proport to the squar of the
distanc at the last post station befor otrdno he gave the driver a
threerubl tip and on arriv he ran breathlessli like a boi up the
step of hi home
after the raptur of meet and after that odd feel of unsatisfi
expectationth feel that everyth is just the same so why
did i hurrynichola began to settl down in hi old home world
hi father and mother were much the same onli a littl older what wa

world she found herself in all that wa go on befor her now seem
quit natur but on the other hand all her previou thought of her
betroth of princess mari or of life in the countri did not onc
recur to her mind and were as if belong to a remot past
in the fourth act there wa some sort of devil who sang wave hi arm
about till the board were withdrawn from under him and he disappear
down below that wa the onli part of the fourth act that natsha saw
she felt agit and torment and the caus of thi wa kurgin whom

onli after she had reach home wa natsha abl clearli to think over
what had happen to her and suddenli rememb princ andrew she

gave a loud exclam flush and ran out of the room
o god i am lost she said to herself how could i let him
she sat for a long time hide her flush face in her hand try to
realiz what had happen to her but wa unabl either to understand
what had happen or what she felt everyth seem dark obscur
and terribl there in that enorm illumin theater where the
bareleg duport in a tinseldecor jacket jump about to the
music on wet board and young girl and old men and the nearli
nake hlne with her proud calm smile raptur cri
bravother in the presenc of that hlne it had all seem
clear and simpl but now alon by herself it wa incomprehens
what is it what wa that terror i felt of him what is thi gnaw
of conscienc i am feel now she thought
onli to the old countess at night in bed could natsha have told all
she wa feel she knew that snya with her sever and simpl view
would either not understand it at all or would be horrifi at such
a confess so natsha tri to solv what wa tortur her by
herself

herself so it is plain that noth ha happen and there is
noth to repent of and andrew can love me still but why still
o god why isnt he here natsha quiet herself for a moment
but again some instinct told her that though all thi wa true and
though noth had happen yet the former puriti of her love for
princ andrew had perish and again in imagin she went over her
whole convers with kurgin and again saw the face gestur and
tender smile of that bold handsom man when he press her arm

book nine 1812
chapter i
from the close of the year 1811 an intensifi arm and concentr of
the forc of western europ began and in 1812 these forcesmillion
of men reckon those transport and feed the armymov from the
west eastward to the russian frontier toward which sinc 1811 russian
forc had been similarli drawn on the twelfth of june 1812 the
forc of western europ cross the russian frontier and war began
that is an event took place oppos to human reason and to human
natur million of men perpetr against on anoth such innumer
crime fraud treacheri theft forgeri issu of fals monei
burglari incendiar and murder as in whole centuri ar not
record in the annal of all the law court of the world but which
those who commit them did not at the time regard as be crime
what produc thi extraordinari occurr what were it caus the
historian tell us with nave assur that it caus were the wrong
inflict on the duke of oldenburg the nonobserv of the continent
system the ambit of napoleon the firm of alexand the
mistak of the diplomatist and so on
consequ it would onli have been necessari for metternich
rumyntsev or talleyrand between a leve and an even parti to have
taken proper pain and written a more adroit note or for napoleon to
have written to alexand my respect brother i consent to restor
the duchi to the duke of oldenburgand there would have been no war
we can understand that the matter seem like that to contemporari
it natur seem to napoleon that the war wa caus by england
intrigu as in fact he said on the island of st helena it natur
seem to member of the english parliament that the caus of the war
wa napoleon ambit to the duke of oldenburg that the caus of the
war wa the violenc done to him to businessmen that the caus of the
war wa the continent system which wa ruin europ to the gener
and old soldier that the chief reason for the war wa the necess of
give them employ to the legitimist of that dai that it wa the
need of reestablish le bon princip and to the diplomatist of
that time that it all result from the fact that the allianc between
russia and austria in 1809 had not been suffici well conceal
from napoleon and from the awkward word of memorandum no 178 it
is natur that these and a countless and infinit quantiti of other
reason the number depend on the endless divers of point
of view present themselv to the men of that dai but to us to
poster who view the thing that happen in all it magnitud and
perceiv it plain and terribl mean these caus seem insuffici
to us it is incomprehens that million of christian men kill and
tortur each other either becaus napoleon wa ambiti or alexand
wa firm or becaus england polici wa astut or the duke of
oldenburg wrong we cannot grasp what connect such circumst
have with the actual fact of slaughter and violenc why becaus the
duke wa wrong thousand of men from the other side of europ kill
and ruin the peopl of smolnsk and moscow and were kill by them
to us their descend who ar not historian and ar not carri
awai by the process of research and can therefor regard the event
with uncloud common sens an incalcul number of caus present
themselv the deeper we delv in search of these caus the more of
them we find and each separ caus or whole seri of caus appear
to us equal valid in itself and equal fals by it insignific
compar to the magnitud of the event and by it impotenceapart
from the cooper of all the other coincid causesto occas the
event to us the wish or object of thi or that french corpor to
serv a second term appear as much a caus as napoleon refus to
withdraw hi troop beyond the vistula and to restor the duchi of
oldenburg for had he not wish to serv and had a second a third
and a thousandth corpor and privat also refus there would have
been so mani less men in napoleon armi and the war could not have
occur
had napoleon not taken offens at the demand that he should withdraw
beyond the vistula and not order hi troop to advanc there would
have been no war but had all hi sergeant object to serv a second
term then also there could have been no war nor could there have been
a war had there been no english intrigu and no duke of oldenburg and
had alexand not felt insult and had there not been an autocrat
govern in russia or a revolut in franc and a subsequ
dictatorship and empir or all the thing that produc the french
revolut and so on without each of these caus noth could have
happen so all these causesmyriad of causescoincid to bring it
about and so there wa no on caus for that occurr but it had
to occur becaus it had to million of men renounc their human
feel and reason had to go from west to east to slai their fellow
just as some centuri previous hord of men had come from the east
to the west slai their fellow
the action of napoleon and alexand on whose word the event seem
to hang were as littl voluntari as the action of ani soldier who wa
drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscript thi could not be
otherwis for in order that the will of napoleon and alexand on whom
the event seem to depend should be carri out the concurr of
innumer circumst wa need without ani on of which the event
could not have taken place it wa necessari that million of men in
whose hand lai the real powerth soldier who fire or transport
provis and gunsshould consent to carri out the will of these weak
individu and should have been induc to do so by an infinit number
of divers and complex caus
we ar forc to fall back on fatal as an explan of irrat
event that is to sai event the reason of which we do
not understand the more we try to explain such event in histori
reason the more unreason and incomprehens do thei becom to
us
each man live for himself us hi freedom to attain hi person
aim and feel with hi whole be that he can now do or abstain from
do thi or that action but as soon as he ha done it that action
perform at a certain moment in time becom irrevoc and belong to
histori in which it ha not a free but a predestin signific
there ar two side to the life of everi man hi individu life which
is the more free the more abstract it interest and hi element hive
life in which he inevit obei law laid down for him
man live conscious for himself but is an unconsci instrument in
the attain of the histor univers aim of human a deed done
is irrevoc and it result coincid in time with the action of
million of other men assum an histor signific the higher a man
stand on the social ladder the more peopl he is connect with
and the more power he ha over other the more evid is the
predestin and inevit of hi everi action
the king heart is in the hand of the lord
a king is histori slave
histori that is the unconsci gener hive life of mankind us
everi moment of the life of king as a tool for it own purpos
though napoleon at that time in 1812 wa more convinc than ever that
it depend on him verser ou ne pa verser le sang de se peupl
as alexand express it in the last letter he wrote himh had never
been so much in the grip of inevit law which compel him while
think that he wa act on hi own volit to perform for the hive
lifethat is to sai for historywhatev had to be perform
to shed or not to shed the blood of hi peopl
the peopl of the west move eastward to slai their fellow men and
by the law of coincid thousand of minut caus fit in and
coordin to produc that movement and war reproach for the
nonobserv of the continent system the duke of oldenburg
wrong the movement of troop into prussiaundertaken as it seem to
napoleon onli for the purpos of secur an arm peac the
french emperor love and habit of war coincid with hi peopl
inclin allur by the grandeur of the prepar and the
expenditur on those prepar and the need of obtain advantag
to compens for that expenditur the intox honor he receiv
in dresden the diplomat negoti which in the opinion of
contemporari were carri on with a sincer desir to attain peac
but which onli wound the selflov of both side and million of
other caus that adapt themselv to the event that wa happen or
coincid with it
when an appl ha ripen and fall why doe it fall becaus of it
attract to the earth becaus it stalk wither becaus it is dri
by the sun becaus it grow heavier becaus the wind shake it or
becaus the boi stand below want to eat it
noth is the caus all thi is onli the coincid of condit in
which all vital organ and element event occur and the botanist
who find that the appl fall becaus the cellular tissu decai and so
forth is equal right with the child who stand under the tree and sai
the appl fell becaus he want to eat it and prai for it equal
right or wrong is he who sai that napoleon went to moscow becaus he
want to and perish becaus alexand desir hi destruct and
he who sai that an undermin hill weigh a million ton fell becaus
the last navvi struck it for the last time with hi mattock in histor

in perplex but no he ha prefer to surround himself with
my enemi and with whom with stein armfeldt bennigsen and
wintzingerod stein a traitor expel from hi own countri
armfeldt a rake and an intrigu wintzingerod a fugit french
subject bennigsen rather more of a soldier than the other but all

have done so he continu made the gestur of a man wish to sai
someth but napoleon alwai interrupt him to the alleg insan
of the swede balashv wish to repli that when russia is on her side
sweden is practic an island but napoleon gave an angri exclam
to drown hi voic napoleon wa in that state of irrit in which
a man ha to talk talk and talk mere to convinc himself that he is
in the right balashv began to feel uncomfort as envoi he fear
to demean hi digniti and felt the necess of repli but as a man
he shrank befor the transport of groundless wrath that had evid
seiz napoleon he knew that none of the word now utter by napoleon
had ani signific and that napoleon himself would be asham of them
when he came to hi sens balashv stood with downcast ey look
at the movement of napoleon stout leg and try to avoid meet
hi ey
but what do i care about your alli said napoleon i have
alliesth pole there ar eighti thousand of them and thei fight like
lion and there will be two hundr thousand of them
and probabl still more perturb by the fact that he had utter thi
obviou falsehood and that balashv still stood silent befor him in
the same attitud of submiss to fate napoleon abruptli turn
round drew close to balashv face and gesticul rapidli and
energet with hi white hand almost shout
know that if you stir up prussia against me ill wipe it off the map
of europ he declar hi face pale and distort by anger and he
struck on of hi small hand energet with the other ye i
will throw you back beyond the dvna and beyond the dnieper and will
reerect against you that barrier which it wa crimin and blind of
europ to allow to be destroi ye that is what will happen to you
that is what you have gain by alien me and he walk silent
sever time up and down the room hi fat shoulder twitch
he put hi snuffbox into hi waistcoat pocket took it out again lift
it sever time to hi nose and stop in front of balashv he
paus look iron straight into balashv ey and said in a
quiet voic
and yet what a splendid reign your master might have had
balashv feel it incumb on him to repli said that from the
russian side thing did not appear in so gloomi a light napoleon wa
silent still look deris at him and evid not listen to
him balashv said that in russia the best result were expect from
the war napoleon nod condescendingli as if to sai i know it
your duti to sai that but you dont believ it yourself i have
convinc you
when balashv had end napoleon again took out hi snuffbox snif
at it and stamp hi foot twice on the floor as a signal the door
open a gentlemaninwait bend respectfulli hand the emperor

i am as devot to him as befor i know him thoroughli and veri highli
esteem hi lofti qualiti i will detain you no longer gener you
shall receiv my letter to the emperor
and napoleon went quickli to the door everyon in the recept room
rush forward and descend the staircas
chapter vii
after all that napoleon had said to himthos burst of anger and the
last dryli spoken word i will detain you no longer gener you
shall receiv my letter balashv felt convinc that napoleon would
not wish to see him and would even avoid anoth meet with himan
insult envoyespeci as he had wit hi unseemli anger but
to hi surpris balashv receiv through duroc an invit to dine
with the emperor that dai
bessir caulaincourt and berthier were present at that dinner
napoleon met balashv cheerfulli and amiabl he not onli show no sign
of constraint or selfreproach on account of hi outburst that morn
but on the contrari tri to reassur balashv it wa evid that
he had long been convinc that it wa imposs for him to make a
mistak and that in hi percept whatev he did wa right not
becaus it harmon with ani idea of right and wrong but becaus he
did it
the emperor wa in veri good spirit after hi ride through vlna where
crowd of peopl had raptur greet and follow him from all
the window of the street through which he rode rug flag and hi
monogram were displai and the polish ladi welcom him wave
their handkerchief to him
at dinner have place balashv besid him napoleon not onli treat
him amiabl but behav as if balashv were on of hi own courtier
on of those who sympath with hi plan and ought to rejoic at
hi success in the cours of convers he mention moscow and
question balashv about the russian capit not mere as an
interest travel ask about a new citi he intend to visit but as
if convinc that balashv as a russian must be flatter by hi
curios
how mani inhabit ar there in moscow how mani hous is it true
that moscow is call holi moscow how mani church ar there in
moscow he ask
and receiv the repli that there were more than two hundr church
he remark
why such a quantiti of church
the russian ar veri devout repli balashv
but a larg number of monasteri and church is alwai a sign of the
backward of a peopl said napoleon turn to caulaincourt for
appreci of thi remark
balashv respectfulli ventur to disagre with the french emperor
everi countri ha it own charact said he
but nowher in europ is there anyth like that said napoleon
i beg your majesti pardon return balashv besid russia there
is spain where there ar also mani church and monasteri
thi repli of balashv which hint at the recent defeat of the
french in spain wa much appreci when he relat it at alexand
court but it wa not much appreci at napoleon dinner where it
pass unnot
the uninterest and perplex face of the marshal show that thei
were puzzl as to what balashv tone suggest if there is a point
we dont see it or it is not at all witti their express seem
to sai so littl wa hi rejoind appreci that napoleon did not
notic it at all and nave ask balashv through what town the
direct road from there to moscow pass balashv who wa on the alert
all through the dinner repli that just as all road lead to rome
so all road lead to moscow there were mani road and among them the
road through poltva which charl xii chose balashv involuntarili
flush with pleasur at the aptitud of thi repli but hardli had
he utter the word poltva befor caulaincourt began speak of the
bad of the road from petersburg to moscow and of hi petersburg
reminisc
after dinner thei went to drink coffe in napoleon studi which four
dai previous had been that of the emperor alexand napoleon sat
down toi with hi svre coffe cup and motion balashv to a
chair besid him
napoleon wa in that wellknown afterdinn mood which more than
ani reason caus make a man content with himself and dispos to
consid everyon hi friend it seem to him that he wa surround
by men who ador him and he felt convinc that after hi dinner
balashv too wa hi friend and worship napoleon turn to him with a
pleasant though slightli iron smile
thei tell me thi is the room the emperor alexand occupi strang
isnt it gener he said evid not doubt that thi remark
would be agreeabl to hi hearer sinc it went to prove hi napoleon
superior to alexand
balashv made no repli and bow hi head in silenc
ye four dai ago in thi room wintzingerod and stein were
deliber continu napoleon with the same deris and
selfconfid smile what i cant understand he went on is that
the emperor alexand ha surround himself with my person enemi
that i do not understand ha he not thought that i mai do the same
and he turn inquiringli to balashv and evid thi thought turn
him back on to the track of hi morn anger which wa still fresh
in him
and let him know that i will do so said napoleon rise and push
hi cup awai with hi hand ill drive all hi wrttemberg baden and
weimar relat out of germani ye ill drive them out let him
prepar an asylum for them in russia
balashv bow hi head with an air indic that he would like to
make hi bow and leav and onli listen becaus he could not help
hear what wa said to him napoleon did not notic thi express
he treat balashv not as an envoi from hi enemi but as a man
now fulli devot to him and who must rejoic at hi former master
humili
and why ha the emperor alexand taken command of the armi what is
the good of that war is my profess but hi busi is to reign
and not to command armi why ha he taken on himself such a
respons
again napoleon brought out hi snuffbox pace sever time up and down
the room in silenc and then suddenli and unexpectedli went up to
balashv and with a slight smile as confid quickli and simpli
as if he were do someth not mere import but pleas to
balashv he rais hi hand to the fortyyearold russian gener
face and take him by the ear pull it gentli smile with hi lip
onli
to have on ear pull by the emperor wa consid the greatest
honor and mark of favor at the french court
well ador and courtier of the emperor alexand why dont you sai
anyth said he as if it wa ridicul in hi presenc to be the
ador and courtier of anyon but himself napoleon ar the hors
readi for the gener he ad with a slight inclin of hi head
in repli to balashv bow let him have mine he ha a long wai to
go
the letter taken by balashv wa the last napoleon sent to alexand
everi detail of the interview wa commun to the russian monarch
and the war began
chapter viii
after hi interview with pierr in moscow princ andrew went to
petersburg on busi as he told hi famili but realli to meet
anatol kurgin whom he felt it necessari to encount on reach
petersburg he inquir for kurgin but the latter had alreadi left the
citi pierr had warn hi brotherinlaw that princ andrew wa on

the minist of war and went to join the armi in moldavia while in
petersburg princ andrew met kutzov hi former command who wa
alwai well dispos toward him and kutzov suggest that he should
accompani him to the armi in moldavia to which the old gener had
been appoint command in chief so princ andrew have receiv an
appoint on the headquart staff left for turkei
princ andrew did not think it proper to write and challeng kurgin
he thought that if he challeng him without some fresh caus it might
compromis the young countess rostva and so he want to meet kurgin
person in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel but he again
fail to meet kurgin in turkei for soon after princ andrew arriv
the latter return to russia in a new countri amid new condit
princ andrew found life easier to bear after hi betroth had broken
faith with himwhich he felt the more acut the more he tri to
conceal it effectsth surround in which he had been happi becam
try to him and the freedom and independ he had onc prize
so highli were still more so not onli could he no longer think the
thought that had first come to him as he lai gaze at the sky on the
field of austerlitz and had later enlarg upon with pierr and which
had fill hi solitud at boguchrovo and then in switzerland and rome
but he even dread to recal them and the bright and boundless horizon
thei had reveal he wa now concern onli with the nearest practic
matter unrel to hi past interest and he seiz on these the more
eagerli the more those past interest were close to him it wa as if
that lofti infinit canopi of heaven that had onc tower abov him
had suddenli turn into a low solid vault that weigh him down in
which all wa clear but noth etern or mysteri
of the activ that present themselv to him armi servic wa the
simplest and most familiar as a gener on duti on kutzov staff
he appli himself to busi with zeal and persever and surpris
kutzov by hi willing and accuraci in work not have found
kurgin in turkei princ andrew did not think it necessari to rush back
to russia after him but all the same he knew that howev long it might
be befor he met kurgin despit hi contempt for him and despit all
the proof he deduc to convinc himself that it wa not worth stoop
to a conflict with himh knew that when he did meet him he would not
be abl to resist call him out ani more than a raven man can help
snatch at food and the conscious that the insult wa not yet
aveng that hi rancor wa still unspent weigh on hi heart and
poison the artifici tranquil which he manag to obtain in
turkei by mean of restless plod and rather vainglori and
ambiti activ
in the year 1812 when new of the war with napoleon reach

princ andrew reach the gener headquart of the armi at the end of
june the first armi with which wa the emperor occupi the fortifi
camp at drissa the second armi wa retreat try to effect a
junction with the first on from which it wa said to be cut off by
larg french forc everyon wa dissatisfi with the gener cours
of affair in the russian armi but no on anticip ani danger of
invas of the russian provinc and no on thought the war would
extend farther than the western the polish provinc
princ andrew found barclai de tolli to whom he had been assign on
the bank of the drissa as there wa not a singl town or larg
villag in the vicin of the camp the immens number of gener and
courtier accompani the armi were live in the best hous of the
villag on both side of the river over a radiu of six mile barclai
de tolli wa quarter nearli three mile from the emperor he receiv
bolknski stiffli and coldli and told him in hi foreign accent that he
would mention him to the emperor for a decis as to hi employ
but ask him meanwhil to remain on hi staff anatol kurgin whom
princ andrew had hope to find with the armi wa not there he had
gone to petersburg but princ andrew wa glad to hear thi hi mind
wa occupi by the interest of the center that wa conduct
a gigant war and he wa glad to be free for a while from the
distract caus by the thought of kurgin dure the first four
dai while no duti were requir of him princ andrew rode round the
whole fortifi camp and by the aid of hi own knowledg and by
talk with expert tri to form a definit opinion about it but the
question whether the camp wa advantag or disadvantag remain
for him undecid alreadi from hi militari experi and what he had
seen in the austrian campaign he had come to the conclus that in
war the most deepli consid plan have no signific and that all
depend on the wai unexpect movement of the enemythat cannot be
foreseenar met and on how and by whom the whole matter is handl
to clear up thi last point for himself princ andrew util hi
posit and acquaint tri to fathom the charact of the control
of the armi and of the men and parti engag in it and he deduc for
himself the follow of the state of affair
while the emperor had still been at vlna the forc had been divid
into three armi first the armi under barclai de tolli secondli the
armi under bagratin and thirdli the on command by tormsov the
emperor wa with the first armi but not as command in chief in the
order issu it wa state not that the emperor would take command
but onli that he would be with the armi the emperor moreov had
with him not a command in chief staff but the imperi headquart
staff in attend on him wa the head of the imperi staff
quartermast gener princ volknski as well as gener imperi
aidesdecamp diplomat offici and a larg number of foreign
but not the armi staff besid these there were in attend on the
emperor without ani definit appoint arakchev the exminist

the chief author of the plan of campaign paulucci an adjut gener
and sardinian migr wolzogenand mani other though these men had no
militari appoint in the armi their posit gave them influenc
and often a corp command or even the command in chief did not
know in what capac he wa question by bennigsen the grand duke
arakchev or princ volknski or wa given thi or that advic and did
not know whether a certain order receiv in the form of advic eman
from the man who gave it or from the emperor and whether it had to be
execut or not but thi wa onli the extern condit the essenti
signific of the presenc of the emperor and of all these peopl
from a courtier point of view and in an emperor vicin all becam
courtier wa clear to everyon it wa thi the emperor did not
assum the titl of command in chief but dispos of all the armi
the men around him were hi assist arakchev wa a faith
custodian to enforc order and act as the sovereign bodyguard
bennigsen wa a landlord in the vlna provinc who appear to be do
the honor of the district but wa in realiti a good gener us
as an advis and readi at hand to replac barclai the grand duke

becaus hi advic wa us and the emperor alexand held him in high
esteem person armfeldt virul hate napoleon and wa a gener
full of selfconfid a qualiti that alwai influenc alexand
paulucci wa there becaus he wa bold and decid in speech the
adjut gener were there becaus thei alwai accompani the
emperor and lastli and chiefli pfuel wa there becaus he had drawn up
the plan of campaign against napoleon and have induc alexand to
believ in the efficaci of that plan wa direct the whole busi
of the war with pfuel wa wolzogen who express pfuel thought in
a more comprehens wai than pfuel himself who wa a harsh bookish
theorist selfconfid to the point of despis everyon els wa
abl to do
besid these russian and foreign who propound new and unexpect
idea everi dayespeci the foreign who did so with a bold
characterist of peopl emploi in a countri not their ownther were
mani secondari personag accompani the armi becaus their princip
were there
among the opinion and voic in thi immens restless brilliant
and proud sphere princ andrew notic the follow sharpli defin
subdivis of tendenc and parti
the first parti consist of pfuel and hi adherentsmilitari theorist
who believ in a scienc of war with immut lawslaw of obliqu
movement outflank and so forth pfuel and hi adher demand
a retir into the depth of the countri in accord with precis
law defin by a pseudotheori of war and thei saw onli barbar
ignor or evil intent in everi deviat from that theori to
thi parti belong the foreign nobl wolzogen wintzingerod and
other chiefli german
the second parti wa directli oppos to the first on extrem as
alwai happen wa met by repres of the other the member of
thi parti were those who had demand an advanc from vlna into poland
and freedom from all prearrang plan besid be advoc of bold
action thi section also repres nation which made them still
more onesid in the disput thei were russian bagratin ermlov
who wa begin to come to the front and other at that time a
famou joke of ermlov wa be circul that as a great favor he
had petit the emperor to make him a german the men of that parti
rememb suvrov said that what on had to do wa not to reason
or stick pin into map but to fight beat the enemi keep him out of
russia and not let the armi get discourag
to the third partyin which the emperor had most confidencebelong the
courtier who tri to arrang compromis between the other two the
member of thi parti chiefli civilian and to whom arakchev belong
thought and said what men who have no convict but wish to seem to
have some gener sai thei said that undoubtedli war particularli
against such a geniu as bonapart thei call him bonapart now
need most deepli devis plan and profound scientif knowledg and
in that respect pfuel wa a geniu but at the same time it had to be
acknowledg that the theorist ar often onesid and therefor on
should not trust them absolut but should also listen to what pfuel
oppon and practic men of experi in warfar had to sai and
then choos a middl cours thei insist on the retent of the camp
at drissa accord to pfuel plan but on chang the movement of
the other armi though by thi cours neither on aim nor the other
could be attain yet it seem best to the adher of thi third
parti
of a fourth opinion the most conspicu repres wa the
tsarvich who could not forget hi disillusion at austerlitz where
he had ridden out at the head of the guard in hi casqu and cavalri
uniform as to a review expect to crush the french gallantli but
unexpectedli find himself in the front line had narrowli escap amid
the gener confus the men of thi parti had both the qualiti
and the defect of frank in their opinion thei fear napoleon
recogn hi strength and their own weak and frankli said so
thei said noth but sorrow shame and ruin will come of all thi
we have abandon vlna and vtebsk and shall abandon drissa the onli
reason thing left to do is to conclud peac as soon as possibl
befor we ar turn out of petersburg
thi view wa veri gener in the upper armi circl and found support
also in petersburg and from the chancellor rumyntsev who for other
reason of state wa in favor of peac
the fifth parti consist of those who were adher of barclai de
tolli not so much as a man but as minist of war and command in
chief be he what he mai thei alwai began like that he is an
honest practic man and we have nobodi better give him real power
for war cannot be conduct successfulli without uniti of command and
he will show what he can do as he did in finland if our armi is well
organ and strong and ha withdrawn to drissa without suffer
ani defeat we ow thi entir to barclai if barclai is now to
be supersed by bennigsen all will be lost for bennigsen show hi
incapac alreadi in 1807
the sixth parti the bennigsenit said on the contrari that at ani
rate there wa no on more activ and experienc than bennigsen and
twist about as you mai you will have to come to bennigsen eventu
let the other make mistak now said thei argu that our
retir to drissa wa a most shame revers and an unbroken seri
of blunder the more mistak that ar made the better it will at ani
rate be understood all the sooner that thing cannot go on like thi
what is want is not some barclai or other but a man like bennigsen
who made hi mark in 1807 and to whom napoleon himself did justicea
man whose author would be willingli recogn and bennigsen is the
onli such man
the seventh parti consist of the sort of peopl who ar alwai to
be found especi around young sovereign and of whom there were
particularli mani round alexandergener and imperi aidesdecamp
passion devot to the emperor not mere as a monarch but as a
man ador him sincer and disinterestedli as rostv had done
in 1805 and who saw in him not onli all the virtu but all human
capabl as well these men though enchant with the sovereign
for refus the command of the armi yet blame him for such excess
modesti and onli desir and insist that their ador sovereign
should abandon hi diffid and openli announc that he would place
himself at the head of the armi gather round him a command in chief
staff and consult experienc theoretician and practic men where
necessari would himself lead the troop whose spirit would therebi be
rais to the highest pitch
the eighth and largest group which in it enorm number wa to the
other as ninetynin to on consist of men who desir neither
peac nor war neither an advanc nor a defens camp at the drissa
or anywher els neither barclai nor the emperor neither pfuel nor
bennigsen but onli the on most essenti thinga much advantag
and pleasur for themselv as possibl in the troubl water of
conflict and intersect intrigu that eddi about the emperor
headquart it wa possibl to succe in mani wai unthink at
other time a man who simpli wish to retain hi lucr post would
todai agre with pfuel tomorrow with hi oppon and the dai after
mere to avoid respons or to pleas the emperor would declar
that he had no opinion at all on the matter anoth who wish to
gain some advantag would attract the emperor attent by loudli
advoc the veri thing the emperor had hint at the dai befor
and would disput and shout at the council beat hi breast and
challeng those who did not agre with him to duel therebi prove
that he wa prepar to sacrific himself for the common good a third
in the absenc of oppon between two council would simpli solicit
a special gratuiti for hi faith servic well know that at that
moment peopl would be too busi to refus him a fourth while seemingli
overwhelm with work would often come accident under the emperor
ey a fifth to achiev hi longcherish aim of dine with the
emperor would stubbornli insist on the correct or falsiti of some
newli emerg opinion and for thi object would produc argument more
or less forcibl and correct
all the men of thi parti were fish for rubl decor and
promot and in thi pursuit watch onli the weathercock of imperi
favor and directli thei notic it turn in ani direct thi whole
drone popul of the armi began blow hard that wai so that it
wa all the harder for the emperor to turn it elsewher amid the
uncertainti of the posit with the menac of seriou danger give
a peculiarli threaten charact to everyth amid thi vortex of
intrigu egot conflict of view and feel and the divers
of race among these peoplethi eighth and largest parti of those
preoccupi with person interest impart great confus and
obscur to the common task whatev question aros a swarm of these
drone without have finish their buzz on a previou theme flew
over to the new on and by their hum drown and obscur the voic of
those who were disput honestli
from among all these parti just at the time princ andrew reach
the armi anoth a ninth parti wa be form and wa begin
to rais it voic thi wa the parti of the elder reason men
experienc and capabl in state affair who without share ani of
those conflict opinion were abl to take a detach view of what
wa go on at the staff at headquart and to consid mean of
escap from thi muddl indecis intricaci and weak
the men of thi parti said and thought that what wa wrong result
chiefli from the emperor presenc in the armi with hi militari court
and from the consequ presenc there of an indefinit condit
and unsteadi fluctuat of relat which is in place at court but
harm in an armi that a sovereign should reign but not command the
armi and that the onli wai out of the posit would be for the emperor
and hi court to leav the armi that the mere presenc of the emperor
paralyz the action of fifti thousand men requir to secur hi
person safeti and that the worst command in chief if independ
would be better than the veri best on trammel by the presenc and
author of the monarch
just at the time princ andrew wa live unoccupi at drissa
shishkv the secretari of state and on of the chief repres of
thi parti wrote a letter to the emperor which arakchev and balashv
agre to sign in thi letter avail himself of permiss given him
by the emperor to discuss the gener cours of affair he respectfulli
suggestedon the plea that it wa necessari for the sovereign to arous
a warlik spirit in the peopl of the capitalthat the emperor should
leav the armi
that arous of the peopl by their sovereign and hi call to them to
defend their countryth veri incit which wa the chief caus of
russia triumph in so far as it wa produc by the tsar person
presenc in moscowwa suggest to the emperor and accept by him as
a pretext for quit the armi
chapter x
thi letter had not yet been present to the emperor when barclai on
dai at dinner inform bolknski that the sovereign wish to see him
person to question him about turkei and that princ andrew wa to
present himself at bennigsen quarter at six that even
new wa receiv at the emperor quarter that veri dai of a fresh
movement by napoleon which might endang the armynew subsequ
found to be fals and that morn colonel michaud had ridden round the
drissa fortif with the emperor and had point out to him that
thi fortifi camp construct by pfuel and till then consid
a chefdoeuvr of tactic scienc which would ensur napoleon
destruct wa an absurd threaten the destruct of the
russian armi
princ andrew arriv at bennigsen quartersa countri gentleman
hous of moder size situat on the veri bank of the river neither
bennigsen nor the emperor wa there but chernshev the emperor
aidedecamp receiv bolknski and inform him that the emperor
accompani by gener bennigsen and marqui paulucci had gone a second
time that dai to inspect the fortif of the drissa camp of the
suitabl of which seriou doubt were begin to be felt
chernshev wa sit at a window in the first room with a french novel
in hi hand thi room had probabl been a music room there wa still
an organ in it on which some rug were pile and in on corner stood
the fold bedstead of bennigsen adjut thi adjut wa also
there and sat doze on the rolledup bed evid exhaust by
work or by feast two door led from the room on straight on into
what had been the draw room and anoth on the right to the studi
through the first door came the sound of voic convers in german
and occasion in french in that draw room were gather by
the emperor wish not a militari council the emperor prefer
indefinit but certain person whose opinion he wish to know in
view of the impend difficulti it wa not a council of war but
as it were a council to elucid certain question for the emperor
person to thi semicouncil had been invit the swedish gener
armfeldt adjut gener wolzogen wintzingerod whom napoleon had
refer to as a renegad french subject michaud toll count stein
who wa not a militari man at all and pfuel himself who as princ
andrew had heard wa the mainspr of the whole affair princ andrew
had an opportun of get a good look at him for pfuel arriv soon
after himself and in pass through to the draw room stop a
minut to speak to chernshev
at first sight pfuel in hi illmad uniform of a russian gener
which fit him badli like a fanci costum seem familiar to princ
andrew though he saw him now for the first time there wa about
him someth of weyroth mack and schmidt and mani other german
theoristgener whom princ andrew had seen in 1805 but he wa more
typic than ani of them princ andrew had never yet seen a german
theorist in whom all the characterist of those other were unit to
such an extent
pfuel wa short and veri thin but broadbon of coars robust build
broad in the hip and with promin shoulder blade hi face wa
much wrinkl and hi ey deep set hi hair had evid been hastili
brush smooth in front of the templ but stuck up behind in quaint
littl tuft he enter the room look restlessli and angrili
around as if afraid of everyth in that larg apart awkwardli
hold up hi sword he address chernshev and ask in german where
the emperor wa on could see that he wish to pass through the room
as quickli as possibl finish with the bow and greet and sit down
to busi in front of a map where he would feel at home he nod
hurriedli in repli to chernshev and smile iron on hear that
the sovereign wa inspect the fortif that he pfuel had
plan in accord with hi theori he mutter someth to himself
abruptli and in a bass voic as selfassur german doit might
have been stupid fellow or the whole affair will be ruin or
someth absurd will come of it princ andrew did not catch
what he said and would have pass on but chernshev introduc him to
pfuel remark that princ andrew wa just back from turkei where the
war had termin so fortun pfuel bare glancednot so much at
princ andrew as past himand said with a laugh that must have been a
fine tactic war and laugh contemptu went on into the room
from which the sound of voic wa heard
pfuel alwai inclin to be irrit sarcast wa particularli
disturb that dai evid by the fact that thei had dare to inspect
and critic hi camp in hi absenc from thi short interview with
pfuel princ andrew thank to hi austerlitz experi wa abl to
form a clear concept of the man pfuel wa on of those hopelessli
and immut selfconfid men selfconfid to the point of
martyrdom as onli german ar becaus onli german ar selfconfid
on the basi of an abstract notionsci that is the suppos
knowledg of absolut truth a frenchman is selfassur becaus he
regard himself person both in mind and bodi as irresist
attract to men and women an englishman is selfassur as be a
citizen of the bestorgan state in the world and therefor as an
englishman alwai know what he should do and know that all he doe as
an englishman is undoubtedli correct an italian is selfassur becaus
he is excit and easili forget himself and other peopl a russian
is selfassur just becaus he know noth and doe not want to know
anyth sinc he doe not believ that anyth can be known the
german selfassur is worst of all stronger and more
repuls than ani other becaus he imagin that he know the
truthsciencewhich he himself ha invent but which is for him the
absolut truth
pfuel wa evid of that sort he had a scienceth theori of obliqu
movement deduc by him from the histori of frederick the great war
and all he came across in the histori of more recent warfar seem to
him absurd and barbarousmonstr collis in which so mani blunder
were commit by both side that these war could not be call war
thei did not accord with the theori and therefor could not serv as
materi for scienc
in 1806 pfuel had been on of those respons for the plan of
campaign that end in jena and auerstdt but he did not see the least
proof of the fallibl of hi theori in the disast of that war on
the contrari the deviat made from hi theori were in hi opinion
the sole caus of the whole disast and with characterist
gleeful sarcasm he would remark there i said the whole affair would
go to the devil pfuel wa on of those theoretician who so love
their theori that thei lose sight of the theori objectit practic
applic hi love of theori made him hate everyth practic and
he would not listen to it he wa even pleas by failur for failur
result from deviat in practic from the theori onli prove to him
the accuraci of hi theori
he said a few word to princ andrew and chernshev about the present
war with the air of a man who know beforehand that all will go wrong
and who is not displeas that it should be so the unbrush tuft
of hair stick up behind and the hastili brush hair on hi templ
express thi most eloqu
he pass into the next room and the deep querul sound of hi
voic were at onc heard from there
chapter xi
princ andrew ey were still follow pfuel out of the room when
count bennigsen enter hurriedli and nod to bolknski but not
paus went into the studi give instruct to hi adjut as he
went the emperor wa follow him and bennigsen had hasten on
to make some prepar and to be readi to receiv the sovereign
chernshev and princ andrew went out into the porch where the emperor
who look fatigu wa dismount marqui paulucci wa talk to
him with particular warmth and the emperor with hi head bent to the
left wa listen with a dissatisfi air the emperor move forward
evid wish to end the convers but the flush and excit
italian oblivi of decorum follow him and continu to speak
and as for the man who advis form thi campth drissa camp said
paulucci as the emperor mount the step and notic princ andrew
scan hi unfamiliar face as to that person sire continu
paulucci desper appar unabl to restrain himself the man
who advis the drissa campi see no altern but the lunat asylum
or the gallow
without heed the end of the italian remark and as though
not hear them the emperor recogn bolknski address him
gracious
i am veri glad to see you go in there where thei ar meet and wait
for me
the emperor went into the studi he wa follow by princ peter
mikhylovich volknski and baron stein and the door close behind them
princ andrew take advantag of the emperor permiss accompani
paulucci whom he had known in turkei into the draw room where the
council wa assembl
princ peter mikhylovich volknski occupi the posit as it were
of chief of the emperor staff he came out of the studi into the
draw room with some map which he spread on a tabl and put
question on which he wish to hear the opinion of the gentlemen
present what had happen wa that new which afterward prove to be
fals had been receiv dure the night of a movement by the french to
outflank the drissa camp
the first to speak wa gener armfeldt who to meet the difficulti that
present itself unexpectedli propos a perfectli new posit
awai from the petersburg and moscow road the reason for thi wa
inexplic unless he wish to show that he too could have an
opinion but he urg that at thi point the armi should unit and
there await the enemi it wa plain that armfeldt had thought out that
plan long ago and now expound it not so much to answer the question
putwhich in fact hi plan did not answera to avail himself of the
opportun to air it it wa on of the million of propos on as
good as anoth that could be made as long as it wa quit unknown
what charact the war would take some disput hi argument other
defend them young count toll object to the swedish gener view
more warmli than anyon els and in the cours of the disput drew from
hi side pocket a wellfil notebook which he ask permiss to
read to them in these volumin note toll suggest anoth scheme
total differ from armfeldt or pfuel plan of campaign in answer
to toll paulucci suggest an advanc and an attack which he urg
could alon extric us from the present uncertainti and from the trap
as he call the drissa camp in which we were situat
dure all these discuss pfuel and hi interpret wolzogen
hi bridg in court relat were silent pfuel onli snort
contemptu and turn awai to show that he would never demean
himself by repli to such nonsens as he wa now hear so when
princ volknski who wa in the chair call on him to give hi
opinion he mere said
why ask me gener armfeldt ha propos a splendid posit with an
expos rear or why not thi italian gentleman attackveri fine or
a retreat also good why ask me said he why you yourselv know
everyth better than i do
but when volknski said with a frown that it wa in the emperor name
that he ask hi opinion pfuel rose and suddenli grow anim
began to speak
everyth ha been spoil everyth muddl everybodi thought thei
knew better than i did and now you come to me how mend matter there
is noth to mend the principl laid down by me must be strictli
adher to said he drum on the tabl with hi boni finger what
is the difficulti nonsens childish
he went up to the map and speak rapidli began prove that no
eventu could alter the effici of the drissa camp that
everyth had been foreseen and that if the enemi were realli go to
outflank it the enemi would inevit be destroi
paulucci who did not know german began question him in french
wolzogen came to the assist of hi chief who spoke french badli
and began translat for him hardli abl to keep pace with pfuel who
wa rapidli demonstr that not onli all that had happen but all
that could happen had been foreseen in hi scheme and that if there
were now ani difficulti the whole fault lai in the fact that hi plan
had not been precis execut he kept laugh sarcast he
demonstr and at last contemptu ceas to demonstr like
a mathematician who ceas to prove in variou wai the accuraci of
a problem that ha alreadi been prove wolzogen took hi place and
continu to explain hi view in french everi now and then turn to
pfuel and sai is it not so your excel but pfuel like a man
heat in a fight who strike those on hi own side shout angrili at
hi own support wolzogen
well of cours what more is there to explain
paulucci and michaud both attack wolzogen simultan in french
armfeldt address pfuel in german toll explain to volknski in
russian princ andrew listen and observ in silenc
of all these men princ andrew sympath most with pfuel angri
determin and absurdli selfconfid as he wa of all those present
evid he alon wa not seek anyth for himself nurs no
hatr against anyon and onli desir that the plan form on a
theori arriv at by year of toil should be carri out he wa
ridicul and unpleasantli sarcast but yet he inspir involuntari
respect by hi boundless devot to an idea besid thi the remark
of all except pfuel had on common trait that had not been notic
at the council of war in 1805 there wa now a panic fear of napoleon
geniu which though conceal wa notic in everi rejoind
everyth wa assum to be possibl for napoleon thei expect him
from everi side and invok hi terribl name to shatter each other
propos pfuel alon seem to consid napoleon a barbarian like
everyon els who oppos hi theori but besid thi feel of
respect pfuel evok piti in princ andrew from the tone in which
the courtier address him and the wai paulucci had allow himself to
speak of him to the emperor but abov all from a certain desper
in pfuel own express it wa clear that the other knew and pfuel
himself felt that hi fall wa at hand and despit hi selfconfid
and grumpi german sarcasm he wa pitiabl with hi hair smoothli
brush on the templ and stick up in tuft behind though he
conceal the fact under a show of irrit and contempt he wa
evid in despair that the sole remain chanc of verifi hi
theori by a huge experi and prove it sound to the whole world
wa slip awai from him
the discuss continu a long time and the longer thei last
the more heat becam the disput culmin in shout and
person and the less wa it possibl to arriv at ani gener
conclus from all that had been said princ andrew listen to thi
polyglot talk and to these surmis plan refut and shout
felt noth but amaz at what thei were sai a thought that had
long sinc and often occur to him dure hi militari activitiesth
idea that there is not and cannot be ani scienc of war and that
therefor there can be no such thing as a militari geniusnow appear
to him an obviou truth what theori and scienc is possibl about a
matter the condit and circumst of which ar unknown and cannot
be defin especi when the strength of the act forc cannot be
ascertain no on wa or is abl to forese in what condit our or
the enemi armi will be in a dai time and no on can gaug the
forc of thi or that detach sometimeswhen there is not a coward
at the front to shout we ar cut off and start run but a brave
and jolli lad who shout hurraha detach of five thousand
is worth thirti thousand as at schn grabern while at time fifti
thousand run from eight thousand as at austerlitz what scienc can
there be in a matter in which as in all practic matter noth
can be defin and everyth depend on innumer condit the
signific of which is determin at a particular moment which arriv
no on know when armfeldt sai our armi is cut in half and paulucci
sai we have got the french armi between two fire michaud sai that
the worthless of the drissa camp li in have the river behind it
and pfuel sai that is what constitut it strength toll propos
on plan armfeldt anoth and thei ar all good and all bad and the
advantag of ani suggest can be seen onli at the moment of trial
and why do thei all speak of a militari geniu is a man a geniu who
can order bread to be brought up at the right time and sai who is to go
to the right and who to the left it is onli becaus militari men ar
invest with pomp and power and crowd of sychoph flatter power
attribut to it qualiti of geniu it doe not possess the best
gener i have known were on the contrari stupid or absentmind
men bagratin wa the best napoleon himself admit that and of
bonapart himself i rememb hi limit selfsatisfi face on the
field of austerlitz not onli doe a good armi command not need ani
special qualiti on the contrari he need the absenc of the highest
and best human attributeslov poetri tender and philosoph
inquir doubt he should be limit firmli convinc that what he
is do is veri import otherwis he will not have suffici
patienc and onli then will he be a brave leader god forbid that he
should be human should love or piti or think of what is just
and unjust it is understand that a theori of their geniu wa
invent for them long ago becaus thei have power the success of a
militari action depend not on them but on the man in the rank who
shout we ar lost or who shout hurrah and onli in the rank
can on serv with assur of be us
so thought princ andrew as he listen to the talk and he rous
himself onli when paulucci call him and everyon wa leav
at the review next dai the emperor ask princ andrew where he would
like to serv and princ andrew lost hi stand in court circl
forev by not ask to remain attach to the sovereign person but
for permiss to serv in the armi
chapter xii
befor the begin of the campaign rostv had receiv a letter from
hi parent in which thei told him briefli of natsha ill and the
break off of her engag to princ andrew which thei explain by
natsha have reject him and again ask nichola to retir from
the armi and return home on receiv thi letter nichola did not
even make ani attempt to get leav of absenc or to retir from the
armi but wrote to hi parent that he wa sorri natsha wa ill and her
engag broken off and that he would do all he could to meet their
wish to snya he wrote separ
ador friend of my soul he wrote noth but honor could keep
me from return to the countri but now at the commenc of the
campaign i should feel dishonor not onli in my comrad ey but
in my own if i prefer my own happi to my love and duti to the
fatherland but thi shall be our last separ believ me directli
the war is over if i am still aliv and still love by you i will
throw up everyth and fly to you to press you forev to my ardent
breast
it wa in fact onli the commenc of the campaign that prevent
rostv from return home as he had promis and marri snya the
autumn in otrdno with the hunt and the winter with the christma
holidai and snya love had open out to him a vista of tranquil
rural joi and peac such as he had never known befor and which now
allur him a splendid wife children a good pack of hound a
dozen leash of smart borzoi agricultur neighbor servic by
elect thought he but now the campaign wa begin and he had
to remain with hi regiment and sinc it had to be so nichola rostv
as wa natur to him felt content with the life he led in the
regiment and wa abl to find pleasur in that life
on hi return from hi furlough nichola have been joyfulli welcom
by hi comrad wa sent to obtain remount and brought back from the
ukrain excel hors which pleas him and earn him commend
from hi command dure hi absenc he had been promot captain
and when the regiment wa put on war foot with an increas in
number he wa again allot hi old squadron
the campaign began the regiment wa move into poland on doubl pai
new offic arriv new men and hors and abov all everybodi wa
infect with the merrili excit mood that goe with the commenc
of a war and rostv consciou of hi advantag posit in the
regiment devot himself entir to the pleasur and interest of
militari servic though he knew that sooner or later he would have to
relinquish them
the troop retir from vlna for variou complic reason of state
polit and strateg each step of the retreat wa accompani by
a complic interplai of interest argument and passion at
headquart for the pvlograd hussar howev the whole of thi
retreat dure the finest period of summer and with suffici suppli
wa a veri simpl and agreeabl busi
it wa onli at headquart that there wa depress uneasi and
intrigu in the bodi of the armi thei did not ask themselv where
thei were go or why if thei regret have to retreat it wa onli
becaus thei had to leav billet thei had grown accustom to or some
pretti young polish ladi if the thought that thing look bad chanc
to enter anyon head he tri to be as cheer as befit a good
soldier and not to think of the gener trend of affair but onli of
the task nearest to hand first thei camp gaili befor vlna make
acquaint with the polish landown prepar for review and be
review by the emperor and other high command then came an order
to retreat to sventsyni and destroi ani provis thei could not carri
awai with them sventsyni wa rememb by the hussar onli as the
drunken camp a name the whole armi gave to their encamp there
and becaus mani complaint were made against the troop who take
advantag of the order to collect provis took also hors
carriag and carpet from the polish proprietor rostv rememb
sventsyni becaus on the first dai of their arriv at that small town
he chang hi sergeant major and wa unabl to manag all the drunken
men of hi squadron who unknown to him had appropri five barrel
of old beer from sventsyni thei retir farther and farther to drissa
and thenc again beyond drissa draw near to the frontier of russia
proper
on the thirteenth of juli the pvlograd took part in a seriou action
for the first time
on the twelfth of juli on the ev of that action there wa a heavi
storm of rain and hail in gener the summer of 1812 wa remark
for it storm
the two pvlograd squadron were bivouack on a field of rye which
wa alreadi in ear but had been complet trodden down by cattl and
hors the rain wa descend in torrent and rostv with a young
offic name ilyn hi protg wa sit in a hastili construct
shelter an offic of their regiment with long mustach extend
onto hi cheek who after ride to the staff had been overtaken by the
rain enter rostv shelter
i have come from the staff count have you heard of ravski
exploit
and the offic gave them detail of the saltnov battl which he had
heard at the staff
rostv smoke hi pipe and turn hi head about as the water
trickl down hi neck listen inattent with an occasion
glanc at ilyn who wa press close to him thi offic a lad
of sixteen who had recent join the regiment wa now in the same
relat to nichola that nichola had been to densov seven year
befor ilyn tri to imit rostv in everyth and ador him as a
girl might have done
zdrzhinski the offic with the long mustach spoke grandiloqu of
the saltnov dam be a russian thermopyla and of how a deed worthi
of antiqu had been perform by gener ravski he recount how
ravski had led hi two son onto the dam under terrif fire and had
charg with them besid him rostv heard the stori and not onli said
noth to encourag zdrzhinski enthusiasm but on the contrari
look like a man asham of what he wa hear though with no
intent of contradict it sinc the campaign of austerlitz and
of 1807 rostv knew by experi that men alwai lie when describ
militari exploit as he himself had done when recount them besid
that he had experi enough to know that noth happen in war at
all as we can imagin or relat it and so he did not like zdrzhinski
tale nor did he like zdrzhinski himself who with hi mustach
extend over hi cheek bent low over the face of hi hearer as wa
hi habit and crowd rostv in the narrow shanti rostv look at him
in silenc in the first place there must have been such a confus
and crowd on the dam that wa be attack that if ravski did lead
hi son there it could have had no effect except perhap on some dozen
men nearest to him thought he the rest could not have seen how or
with whom ravski came onto the dam and even those who did see it
would not have been much stimul by it for what had thei to do with
ravski tender patern feel when their own skin were in danger
and besid the fate of the fatherland did not depend on whether
thei took the saltnov dam or not as we ar told wa the case at
thermopyla so why should he have made such a sacrific and why expos

on receiv new of natsha ill the countess though not quit
well yet and still weak went to moscow with ptya and the rest of the
household and the whole famili move from mrya dmtrievna hous to
their own and settl down in town
natsha ill wa so seriou that fortun for her and for
her parent the consider of all that had caus the ill
her conduct and the break off of her engag reced into the
background she wa so ill that it wa imposs for them to consid
in how far she wa to blame for what had happen she could not eat
or sleep grew visibl thinner cough and as the doctor made them
feel wa in danger thei could not think of anyth but how to help
her doctor came to see her singli and in consult talk much in
french german and latin blame on anoth and prescrib a great
varieti of medicin for all the diseas known to them but the simpl
idea never occur to ani of them that thei could not know the diseas
natsha wa suffer from as no diseas suffer by a live man can be
known for everi live person ha hi own peculiar and alwai
ha hi own peculiar person novel complic diseas unknown to
medicinenot a diseas of the lung liver skin heart nerv and so
on mention in medic book but a diseas consist of on of the
innumer combin of the maladi of those organ thi simpl
thought could not occur to the doctor as it cannot occur to a wizard
that he is unabl to work hi charm becaus the busi of their
live wa to cure and thei receiv monei for it and had spent the best
year of their live on that busi but abov all that thought
wa kept out of their mind by the fact that thei saw thei were
realli us as in fact thei were to the whole rostv famili their
us did not depend on make the patient swallow substanc for
the most part harm the harm wa scarc percept as thei
were given in small dose but thei were us necessari and
indispens becaus thei satisfi a mental need of the invalid and
of those who love herand that is why there ar and alwai will be
pseudoheal wise women homeopath and allopath thei satisfi
that etern human need for hope of relief for sympathi and that
someth should be done which is felt by those who ar suffer thei
satisfi the need seen in it most elementari form in a child when it
want to have a place rub that ha been hurt a child knock itself
and run at onc to the arm of it mother or nurs to have the ach
spot rub or kiss and it feel better when thi is done the child
cannot believ that the strongest and wisest of it peopl have no
remedi for it pain and the hope of relief and the express of it
mother sympathi while she rub the bump comfort it the doctor were
of us to natsha becaus thei kiss and rub her bump assur her
that it would soon pass if onli the coachman went to the chemist in
the arbt and got a powder and some pill in a pretti box for a rubl
and seventi kopek and if she took those powder in boil water at
interv of precis two hour neither more nor less
what would snya and the count and countess have done how would thei
have look if noth had been done if there had not been those pill
to give by the clock the warm drink the chicken cutlet and all the
other detail of life order by the doctor the carri out of which
suppli an occup and consol to the famili circl how would
the count have born hi dearli love daughter ill had he not
known that it wa cost him a thousand rubl and that he would not
grudg thousand more to benefit her or had he not known that if her
ill continu he would not grudg yet other thousand and would take
her abroad for consult there and had he not been abl to explain
the detail of how mtivier and feller had not understood the symptom
but frise had and mdrov had diagnos them even better what would the
countess have done had she not been abl sometim to scold the invalid
for not strictli obei the doctor order
youll never get well like that she would sai forget her grief
in her vexat if you wont obei the doctor and take your medicin at
the right time you mustnt trifl with it you know or it mai turn to
pneumonia she would go on deriv much comfort from the utter of
that foreign word incomprehens to other as well as to herself
what would snya have done without the glad conscious that she had
not undress dure the first three night in order to be readi to
carri out all the doctor injunct with precis and that she
still kept awak at night so as not to miss the proper time when the
slightli harm pill in the littl gilt box had to be administ
even to natsha herself it wa pleasant to see that so mani sacrific
were be made for her sake and to know that she had to take medicin
at certain hour though she declar that no medicin would cure her
and that it wa all nonsens and it wa even pleasant to be abl to
show by disregard the order that she did not believ in medic
treatment and did not valu her life
the doctor came everi dai felt her puls look at her tongu and
regardless of her griefstricken face joke with her but when he had
gone into anoth room to which the countess hurriedli follow him he
assum a grave air and thoughtfulli shake hi head said that though
there wa danger he had hope of the effect of thi last medicin and
on must wait and see that the maladi wa chiefli mental but and
the countess try to conceal the action from herself and from him
slip a gold coin into hi hand and alwai return to the patient
with a more tranquil mind
the symptom of natsha ill were that she at littl slept
littl cough and wa alwai lowspirit the doctor said that
she could not get on without medic treatment so thei kept her in the
stifl atmospher of the town and the rostv did not move to the
countri that summer of 1812
in spite of the mani pill she swallow and the drop and powder out
of the littl bottl and box of which madam schoss who wa fond of
such thing made a larg collect and in spite of be depriv of
the countri life to which she wa accustom youth prevail natsha
grief began to be overlaid by the impress of daili life it ceas
to press so painfulli on her heart it gradual fade into the past
and she began to recov physic
chapter xvii
natsha wa calmer but no happier she not mere avoid all extern
form of pleasurebal promenad concert and theatersbut she
never laugh without a sound of tear in her laughter she could not
sing as soon as she began to laugh or tri to sing by herself tear
choke her tear of remors tear at the recollect of those pure
time which could never return tear of vexat that she should so
uselessli have ruin her young life which might have been so happi
laughter and sing in particular seem to her like a blasphemi
in face of her sorrow without ani need of selfrestraint no wish to
coquet ever enter her head she said and felt at that time that no
man wa more to her than nastsya ivnovna the buffoon someth stood
sentinel within her and forbad her everi joi besid she had lost all
the old interest of her carefre girlish life that had been so full
of hope the previou autumn the hunt uncl and the christma
holidai spent with nichola at otrdno were what she recal oftenest
and most painfulli what would she not have given to bring back even a
singl dai of that time but it wa gone forev her presenti at
the time had not deceiv herthat that state of freedom and readi
for ani enjoy would not return again yet it wa necessari to live
on
it comfort her to reflect that she wa not better as she had formerli
imagin but wors much wors than anybodi els in the world but
thi wa not enough she knew that and ask herself what next
but there wa noth to come there wa no joi in life yet life wa
pass natsha appar tri not to be a burden or a hindranc to
anyon but want noth for herself she kept awai from everyon in
the hous and felt at eas onli with her brother ptya she like to
be with him better than with the other and when alon with him she
sometim laugh she hardli ever left the hous and of those who came
to see them wa glad to see onli on person pierr it would have been
imposs to treat her with more delicaci greater care and at the
same time more serious than did count bezkhov natsha unconsci
felt thi delicaci and so found great pleasur in hi societi but
she wa not even grate to him for it noth good on pierr part
seem to her to be an effort it seem so natur for him to be kind
to everyon that there wa no merit in hi kind sometim natsha
notic embarrass and awkward on hi part in her presenc
especi when he want to do someth to pleas her or fear that
someth thei spoke of would awaken memori distress to her she
notic thi and attribut it to hi gener kind and shyness
which she imagin must be the same toward everyon as it wa to her
after those involuntari wordsthat if he were free he would have ask
on hi knee for her hand and her loveutt at a moment when she wa
so strongli agit pierr never spoke to natsha of hi feel
and it seem plain to her that those word which had then so comfort
her were spoken as all sort of meaningless word ar spoken to comfort
a cry child it wa not becaus pierr wa a marri man but becaus
natsha felt veri strongli with him that moral barrier the absenc of
which she had experienc with kurgin that it never enter her head
that the relat between him and herself could lead to love on her
part still less on hi or even to the kind of tender selfconsci
romant friendship between a man and a woman of which she had known
sever instanc
befor the end of the fast of st peter agrafna ivnovna belva a
countri neighbor of the rostv came to moscow to pai her devot at
the shrine of the moscow saint she suggest that natsha should fast
and prepar for holi communion and natsha gladli welcom the idea

go to church everi dai for a week and not onc miss vesper
matin or mass
the countess wa pleas with natsha zeal after the poor result of
the medic treatment in the depth of her heart she hope that prayer
might help her daughter more than medicin and though not without
fear and conceal it from the doctor she agre to natsha wish and
entrust her to belva agrafna ivnovna us to come to wake natsha
at three in the morn but gener found her alreadi awak she wa
afraid of be late for matin hastili wash and meekli put on
her shabbiest dress and an old mantilla natsha shiver in the fresh

by agrafna ivnovna advic natsha prepar herself not in their

ivnovna the priest wa a man of veri sever and lofti life there were
never mani peopl in the church natsha alwai stood besid belva in

humil befor someth great and incomprehens seiz her when
at that unusu morn hour gaze at the dark face of the virgin
illumin by the candl burn befor it and by the morn light
fall from the window she listen to the word of the servic which
she tri to follow with understand when she understood them her
person feel becam interwoven in the prayer with shade of it

amid everi occup wa now replac not by anoth question or by a
repli to the former question but by her imag when he listen to or
himself took part in trivial convers when he read or heard of
human base or folli he wa not horrifi as formerli and did
not ask himself why men struggl so about these thing when all is so
transient and incomprehensiblebut he rememb her as he had last
seen her and all hi doubt vanishednot becaus she had answer
the question that had haunt him but becaus hi concept of her
transfer him instantli to anoth a brighter realm of spiritu
activ in which no on could be justifi or guiltya realm of beauti
and love which it wa worth live for whatev worldli base

smile at me yesterdai and ask me to come again and i love her and
no on will ever know it and hi soul felt calm and peac
pierr still went into societi drank as much and led the same idl
and dissip life becaus besid the hour he spent at the rostv
there were other hour he had to spend somehow and the habit and
acquaint he had made in moscow form a current that bore him along
irresist but latterli when more and more disquiet report came
from the seat of war and natsha health began to improv and she
no longer arous in him the former feel of care piti an
everincreas restless which he could not explain took

in the apocalyps moreov by appli the same system to the word
quarantedeux which wa the term allow to the beast that spoke
great thing and blasphemi the same number 666 wa obtain from
which it follow that the limit fix for napoleon power had come
in the year 1812 when the french emperor wa fortytwo thi propheci
pleas pierr veri much and he often ask himself what would put an
end to the power of the beast that is of napoleon and tri by the

answer to the question that engross him he wrote the word lempereur
alexandr la nation russ and ad up their number but the sum

wrote down hi own name in french comt pierr besouhoff but the

answer he sought lruss besuhof made 666 thi discoveri excit him
how or by what mean he wa connect with the great event foretold in
the apocalyps he did not know but he did not doubt that connect for
a moment hi love for natsha antichrist napoleon the invas the
comet 666 lempereur napolon and lruss besuhofal thi had to
matur and culmin to lift him out of that spellbound petti sphere
of moscow habit in which he felt himself held captiv and lead him to a
great achiev and great happi
fortytwo
on the ev of the sundai when the special prayer wa read pierr had
promis the rostv to bring them from count rostopchn whom he knew
well both the appeal to the peopl and the new from the armi in the
morn when he went to call at rostopchn he met there a courier
fresh from the armi an acquaint of hi own who often danc at
moscow ball
do pleas for heaven sake reliev me of someth said the
courier i have a sack of letter to parent
among these letter wa on from nichola rostv to hi father pierr
took that letter and rostopchn also gave him the emperor appeal to
moscow which had just been print the last armi order and hi own
most recent bulletin glanc through the armi order pierr found in
on of them in the list of kill wound and reward the name of
nichola rostv award a st georg cross of the fourth class for

consciou of ever sinc the appear of the comet and especi
sinc the begin of the war
he had long been think of enter the armi and would have done so
had he not been hinder first by hi membership of the societi of
freemason to which he wa bound by oath and which preach perpetu
peac and the abolit of war and secondli by the fact that when he
saw the great mass of muscovit who had don uniform and were talk
patriot he somehow felt asham to take the step but the chief
reason for not carri out hi intent to enter the armi lai in the
vagu idea that he wa lruss besuhof who had the number of the beast
666 that hi part in the great affair of set a limit to the
power of the beast that spoke great and blasphem thing had been
predestin from etern and that therefor he ought not to undertak
anyth but wait for what wa bound to come to pass

book ten 1812
chapter i
napoleon began the war with russia becaus he could not resist go
to dresden could not help have hi head turn by the homag he
receiv could not help don a polish uniform and yield to the
stimul influenc of a june morn and could not refrain from
burst of anger in the presenc of kurkin and then of balashv
alexand refus negoti becaus he felt himself to be person
insult barclai de tolli tri to command the armi in the best
wai becaus he wish to fulfil hi duti and earn fame as a great
command rostv charg the french becaus he could not restrain
hi wish for a gallop across a level field and in the same wai the
innumer peopl who took part in the war act in accord with their
person characterist habit circumst and aim thei were
move by fear or vaniti rejoic or were indign reason imagin
that thei knew what thei were do and did it of their own free will
but thei all were involuntari tool of histori carri on a work
conceal from them but comprehens to us such is the inevit
fate of men of action and the higher thei stand in the social hierarchi
the less ar thei free
the actor of 1812 have long sinc left the stage their person
interest have vanish leav no trace and noth remain of that
time but it histor result
provid compel all these men strive to attain person aim to
further the accomplish of a stupend result no on of them at all
expectedneith napoleon nor alexand nor still less ani of those
who did the actual fight
the caus of the destruct of the french armi in 1812 is clear to us
now no on will deni that that caus wa on the on hand it advanc
into the heart of russia late in the season without ani prepar for
a winter campaign and on the other the charact given to the war
by the burn of russian town and the hatr of the foe thi arous
among the russian peopl but no on at the time foresaw what now seem
so evid that thi wa the onli wai an armi of eight hundr thousand
menth best in the world and led by the best generalcould be destroi
in conflict with a raw armi of half it numer strength and led by
inexperienc command as the russian armi wa not onli did no on
see thi but on the russian side everi effort wa made to hinder the
onli thing that could save russia while on the french side despit
napoleon experi and socal militari geniu everi effort wa
direct to push on to moscow at the end of the summer that is to
do the veri thing that wa bound to lead to destruct
in histor work on the year 1812 french writer ar veri fond of
sai that napoleon felt the danger of extend hi line that he
sought a battl and that hi marshal advis him to stop at smolnsk
and of make similar statement to show that the danger of the campaign
wa even then understood russian author ar still fonder of tell
us that from the commenc of the campaign a scythian war plan wa
adopt to lure napoleon into the depth of russia and thi plan some
of them attribut to pfuel other to a certain frenchman other to
toll and other again to alexand himselfpoint to note project
and letter which contain hint of such a line of action but all these
hint at what happen both from the french side and the russian ar
advanc onli becaus thei fit in with the event had that event not
occur these hint would have been forgotten as we have forgotten the
thousand and million of hint and expect to the contrari
which were current then but have now been forgotten becaus the event
falsifi them there ar alwai so mani conjectur as to the issu of
ani event that howev it mai end there will alwai be peopl to sai
i said then that it would be so quit forget that amid their
innumer conjectur mani were to quit the contrari effect
conjectur as to napoleon awar of the danger of extend hi
line and on the russian side as to lure the enemi into the depth
of russia ar evid of that kind and onli by much strain can
historian attribut such concept to napoleon and hi marshal
or such plan to the russian command all the fact ar in flat
contradict to such conjectur dure the whole period of the war
not onli wa there no wish on the russian side to draw the french
into the heart of the countri but from their first entri into russia
everyth wa done to stop them and not onli wa napoleon not afraid
to extend hi line but he welcom everi step forward as a triumph and
did not seek battl as eagerli as in former campaign but veri lazili
at the veri begin of the war our armi were divid and our sole
aim wa to unit them though unit the armi wa no advantag if we
meant to retir and lure the enemi into the depth of the countri our
emperor join the armi to encourag it to defend everi inch of russian
soil and not to retreat the enorm drissa camp wa form on pfuel
plan and there wa no intent of retir farther the emperor
reproach the command in chief for everi step thei retir he could
not bear the idea of let the enemi even reach smolnsk still less
could he contempl the burn of moscow and when our armi did
unit he wa displeas that smolnsk wa abandon and burn without a
gener engag have been fought under it wall
so thought the emperor and the russian command and peopl were still
more provok at the thought that our forc were retreat into the
depth of the countri
napoleon have cut our armi apart advanc far into the countri and
miss sever chanc of forc an engag in august he wa at
smolnsk and thought onli of how to advanc farther though as we now
see that advanc wa evid ruinou to him
the fact clearli show that napoleon did not forese the danger of the
advanc on moscow nor did alexand and the russian command then
think of lure napoleon on but quit the contrari the lure of
napoleon into the depth of the countri wa not the result of ani plan
for no on believ it to be possibl it result from a most complex
interplai of intrigu aim and wish among those who took part in
the war and had no percept whatev of the inevit or of the on
wai of save russia everyth came about fortuit the armi
were divid at the commenc of the campaign we tri to unit
them with the evid intent of give battl and check the
enemi advanc and by thi effort to unit them while avoid battl
with a much stronger enemi and necessarili withdraw the armi at
an acut anglew led the french on to smolnsk but we withdrew at an
acut angl not onli becaus the french advanc between our two armi
the angl becam still more acut and we withdrew still farther becaus
barclai de tolli wa an unpopular foreign dislik by bagratin who
would come under hi command and bagratinb in command of the
second armytri to postpon join up and come under barclai
command as long as he could bagratin wa slow in effect the
junctionthough that wa the chief aim of all at headquartersbecaus
as he alleg he expos hi armi to danger on thi march and it wa
best for him to retir more to the left and more to the south worri
the enemi from flank and rear and secur from the ukrain recruit for
hi armi and it look as if he plan thi in order not to come under
the command of the detest foreign barclai whose rank wa inferior
to hi own
the emperor wa with the armi to encourag it but hi presenc and
ignor of what step to take and the enorm number of advis and
plan destroi the first armi energi and it retir
the intent wa to make a stand at the drissa camp but paulucci
aim at becom command in chief unexpectedli emploi hi energi
to influenc alexand and pfuel whole plan wa abandon and the
command entrust to barclai but as barclai did not inspir confid
hi power wa limit the armi were divid there wa no uniti of
command and barclai wa unpopular but from thi confus divis
and the unpopular of the foreign command in chief there result
on the on hand indecis and the avoid of a battl which we could
not have refrain from had the armi been unit and had someon els
instead of barclai been in command and on the other an everincreas
indign against the foreign and an increas in patriot zeal
at last the emperor left the armi and as the most conveni and inde
the onli pretext for hi departur it wa decid that it wa necessari
for him to inspir the peopl in the capit and arous the nation in
gener to a patriot war and by thi visit of the emperor to moscow
the strength of the russian armi wa trebl
he left in order not to obstruct the command in chief undivid
control of the armi and hope that more decis action would then
be taken but the command of the armi becam still more confus and
enfeebl bennigsen the tsarvich and a swarm of adjut gener
remain with the armi to keep the command in chief under observ
and arous hi energi and barclai feel less free than ever under
the observ of all these ey of the emperor becam still more
cautiou of undertak ani decis action and avoid give battl
barclai stood for caution the tsarvich hint at treacheri and
demand a gener engag lubomrski bronntski wlocki and the
other of that group stir up so much troubl that barclai under
pretext of send paper to the emperor dispatch these polish
adjut gener to petersburg and plung into an open struggl with
bennigsen and the tsarvich
at smolnsk the armi at last reunit much as bagratin dislik it
bagratin drove up in a carriag to the hous occupi by barclai
barclai don hi sash and came out to meet and report to hi senior
offic bagratin

chapter vi
among the innumer categori applic to the phenomena of human
life on mai discrimin between those in which substanc prevail
and those in which form prevail to the lattera distinguish
from villag countri provinci or even moscow lifew mai allot
petersburg life and especi the life of it salon that life of
the salon is unchang sinc the year 1805 we had made peac and had
again quarrel with bonapart and had made constitut and unmad
them again but the salon of anna pvlovna and hlne remain just
as thei had beenth on seven and the other five year befor at anna
pvlovna thei talk with perplex of bonapart success just
as befor and saw in them and in the subservi shown to him by the
european sovereign a malici conspiraci the sole object of which wa
to caus unpleas and anxieti to the court circl of which anna
pvlovna wa the repres and in hlne salon which rumyntsev
himself honor with hi visit regard hlne as a remark
intellig woman thei talk with the same ecstasi in 1812 as in 1808
of the great nation and the great man and regret our ruptur
with franc a ruptur which accord to them ought to be promptli
termin by peac
of late sinc the emperor return from the armi there had been some
excit in these conflict salon circl and some demonstr
of hostil to on anoth but each camp retain it own tendenc
in anna pvlovna circl onli those frenchmen were admit who were
deeproot legitimist and patriot view were express to the
effect that on ought not to go to the french theater and that to
maintain the french troup wa cost the govern as much as a whole
armi corp the progress of the war wa eagerli follow and onli
the report most flatter to our armi were circul in the french
circl of hlne and rumyntsev the report of the cruelti of the
enemi and of the war were contradict and all napoleon attempt at
concili were discuss in that circl thei discountenanc those
who advis hurri prepar for a remov to kazn of the court and
the girl educ establish under the patronag of the dowag
empress in hlne circl the war in gener wa regard as a seri
of formal demonstr which would veri soon end in peac and the
view prevail express by bilbinwho now in petersburg wa quit at
home in hlne hous which everi clever man wa oblig to visitthat
not by gunpowd but by those who invent it would matter be
settl in that circl the moscow enthusiasmnew of which had reach
petersburg simultan with the emperor returnwa ridicul
sarcast and veri cleverli though with much caution
anna pvlovna circl on the contrari wa enraptur by thi enthusiasm
and spoke of it as plutarch speak of the deed of the ancient
princ vasli who still occupi hi former import post form a
connect link between these two circl he visit hi good friend
anna pvlovna as well as hi daughter diplomat salon and often
in hi constant come and go between the two camp becam confus
and said at hlne what he should have said at anna pvlovna and
vice versa
soon after the emperor return princ vasli in a convers about
the war at anna pvlovna sever condemn barclai de tolli but wa
undecid as to who ought to be appoint command in chief on of the
visitor usual spoken of as a man of great merit have describ
how he had that dai seen kutzov the newli chosen chief of the
petersburg militia presid over the enrol of recruit at the
treasuri cautious ventur to suggest that kutzov would be the man
to satisfi all requir
anna pvlovna remark with a melancholi smile that kutzov had done
noth but caus the emperor annoy
i have talk and talk at the assembl of the nobil princ
vasli interrupt but thei did not listen to me i told them hi
elect as chief of the militia would not pleas the emperor thei did
not listen to me
it all thi mania for opposit he went on and who for it is
all becaus we want to ap the foolish enthusiasm of those muscovit
princ vasli continu forget for a moment that though at hlne
on had to ridicul the moscow enthusiasm at anna pvlovna on had to
be ecstat about it but he retriev hi mistak at onc now is
it suitabl that count kutzov the oldest gener in russia should
presid at that tribun he will get noth for hi pain how could
thei make a man command in chief who cannot mount a hors who drop
asleep at a council and ha the veri worst moral a good reput
he made for himself at bucharest i dont speak of hi capac as a
gener but at a time like thi how thei appoint a decrepit blind old
man posit blind a fine idea to have a blind gener he cant see
anyth to plai blindman bulff he cant see at all
no on repli to hi remark
thi wa quit correct on the twentyfourth of juli but on the
twentyninth of juli kutzov receiv the titl of princ thi might
indic a wish to get rid of him and therefor princ vasli opinion
continu to be correct though he wa not now in ani hurri to express
it but on the eighth of august a committe consist of field marshal
saltykv arakchev vyazmtinov lopukhn and kochubi met to consid
the progress of the war thi committe came to the conclus that
our failur were due to a want of uniti in the command and though the
member of the committe were awar of the emperor dislik of kutzov
after a short deliber thei agre to advis hi appoint as
command in chief that same dai kutzov wa appoint command
in chief with full power over the armi and over the whole region
occupi by them
on the ninth of august princ vasli at anna pvlovna again met the
man of great merit the latter wa veri attent to anna pvlovna
becaus he want to be appoint director of on of the educ
establish for young ladi princ vasli enter the room with the
air of a happi conqueror who ha attain the object of hi desir
well have you heard the great new princ kutzov is field marshal
all dissens ar at an end i am so glad so delight at last
we have a man said he glanc sternli and significantli round at
everyon in the draw room
the man of great merit despit hi desir to obtain the post of
director could not refrain from remind princ vasli of hi former
opinion though thi wa impolit to princ vasli in anna pvlovna
draw room and also to anna pvlovna herself who had receiv the
new with delight he could not resist the temptat
but princ thei sai he is blind said he remind princ vasli of
hi own word
eh nonsens he see well enough said princ vasli rapidli in a
deep voic and with a slight coughth voic and cough with which he wa
wont to dispos of all difficulti
he see well enough he ad and what i am so pleas about he
went on is that our sovereign ha given him full power over all
the armi and the whole regionpow no command in chief ever had
befor he is a second autocrat he conclud with a victori smile
god grant it god grant it said anna pvlovna
the man of great merit who wa still a novic in court circl
wish to flatter anna pvlovna by defend her former posit on
thi question observ
it is said that the emperor wa reluct to give kutzov those power
thei sai he blush like a girl to whom jocond is read when he said to
kutzov your emperor and the fatherland award you thi honor
perhap the heart took no part in that speech said anna pvlovna
oh no no warmli rejoin princ vasli who would not now yield
kutzov to anyon in hi opinion kutzov wa not onli admir
himself but wa ador by everybodi no that imposs said he
for our sovereign appreci him so highli befor
god grant onli that princ kutzov assum real power and doe not
allow anyon to put a spoke in hi wheel observ anna pvlovna
understand at onc to whom she allud princ vasli said in a
whisper
i know for a fact that kutzov made it an absolut condit that the
tsarvich should not be with the armi do you know what he said to the
emperor
and princ vasli repeat the word suppos to have been spoken by
kutzov to the emperor i can neither punish him if he doe wrong nor
reward him if he doe right
oh a veri wise man is princ kutzov i have known him a long time
thei even sai remark the man of great merit who did not yet
possess courtli tact that hi excel made it an express condit
that the sovereign himself should not be with the armi
as soon as he said thi both princ vasli and anna pvlovna turn awai
from him and glanc sadli at on anoth with a sigh at hi navet
chapter vii
while thi wa take place in petersburg the french had alreadi pass
smolnsk and were draw nearer and nearer to moscow napoleon
historian thier like other of hi historian try to justifi hi
hero sai that he wa drawn to the wall of moscow against hi will he
is as right as other historian who look for the explan of histor
event in the will of on man he is as right as the russian historian
who maintain that napoleon wa drawn to moscow by the skill of the
russian command here besid the law of retrospect which regard
all the past as a prepar for event that subsequ occur
the law of reciproc come in confus the whole matter a good
chessplay have lost a game is sincer convinc that hi loss
result from a mistak he made and look for that mistak in the
open but forget that at each stage of the game there were similar
mistak and that none of hi move were perfect he onli notic the
mistak to which he pai attent becaus hi oppon took advantag
of it how much more complex than thi is the game of war which
occur under certain limit of time and where it is not on will that
manipul lifeless object but everyth result from innumer
conflict of variou will

contemporari were more clearli and strongli notic than among
other on instanc which had occur some twenti year befor wa
a movement among the peasant to emigr to some unknown warm river
hundr of peasant among them the boguchrovo folk suddenli began
sell their cattl and move in whole famili toward the southeast

of them were punish some sent to siberia mani di of cold and
hunger on the road mani return of their own accord and the movement
di down of itself just as it had sprung up without appar reason
but such undercurr still exist among the peopl and gather new
forc readi to manifest themselv just as strang unexpectedli and
at the same time simpli natur and forcibl now in 1812 to anyon
live in close touch with these peopl it wa appar that these
undercurr were act strongli and near an erupt

which it had been decid not to move but to wait yet there wa no
time to wast on the fifteenth the dai of the old princ death

becom danger he had told her that after the sixteenth he could
not be respons for what might happen on the even of the dai the
old princ di the marshal went awai promis to return next dai for

the french had unexpectedli advanc and had bare time to remov hi
own famili and valuabl from hi estat
for some thirti year boguchrovo had been manag by the villag elder
dron whom the old princ call by the diminut drnushka
dron wa on of those physic and mental vigor peasant who grow
big beard as soon as thei ar of ag and go on unchang till thei
ar sixti or seventi without a grai hair or the loss of a tooth as
straight and strong at sixti as at thirti
soon after the migrat to the warm river in which he had taken
part like the rest dron wa made villag elder and overs of
boguchrovo and had sinc fill that post irreproach for
twentythre year the peasant fear him more than thei did their
master the master both the old princ and the young and the steward
respect him and jestingli call him the minist dure the
whole time of hi servic dron had never been drunk or ill never after
sleepless night or the hardest task had he shown the least fatigu
and though he could not read he had never forgotten a singl monei
account or the number of quarter of flour in ani of the endless
cartload he sold for the princ nor a singl shock of the whole corn
crop on ani singl acr of the boguchrovo field
alptych arriv from the devast bald hill estat sent for hi
dron on the dai of the princ funer and told him to have twelv
hors got readi for the princess carriag and eighteen cart for
the thing to be remov from boguchrovo though the peasant paid

with thi order for there were two hundr and thirti household at
work in boguchrovo and the peasant were well to do but on hear the
order dron lower hi ey and remain silent alptych name certain
peasant he knew from whom he told him to take the cart
dron repli that the hors of these peasant were awai cart
alptych name other but thei too accord to dron had no hors
avail some hors were cart for the govern other were too
weak and other had di for want of fodder it seem that no hors
could be had even for the carriag much less for the cart
alptych look intent at dron and frown just as dron wa a model
villag elder so alptych had not manag the princ estat for
twenti year in vain he wa a model steward possess in the highest
degre the faculti of divin the need and instinct of those he dealt
with have glanc at dron he at onc understood that hi answer did
not express hi person view but the gener mood of the boguchrovo
commun by which the elder had alreadi been carri awai but he also
knew that dron who had acquir properti and wa hate by the commun
must be hesit between the two camp the master and the serf
he notic thi hesit in dron look and therefor frown and
move closer up to him
now just listen drnushka said he dont talk nonsens to me hi
excel princ andrew himself gave me order to move all the peopl
awai and not leav them with the enemi and there is an order from the
tsar about it too anyon who stai is a traitor to the tsar do you
hear
i hear dron answer without lift hi ey
alptych wa not satisfi with thi repli
eh dron it will turn out badli he said shake hi head
the power is in your hand dron rejoin sadli
eh dron drop it alptych repeat withdraw hi hand from hi
bosom and solemnli point to the floor at dron feet i can see
through you and three yard into the ground under you he continu
gaze at the floor in front of dron
dron wa disconcert glanc furtiv at alptych and again lower
hi ey
you drop thi nonsens and tell the peopl to get readi to leav their
home and go to moscow and to get cart readi for tomorrow morn

for christ sake
stop that cri alptych sternli i see through you and three yard
under you he repeat know that hi skill in beekeep hi
knowledg of the right time to sow the oat and the fact that he had
been abl to retain the old princ favor for twenti year had long
sinc gain him the reput of be a wizard and that the power of
see three yard under a man is consid an attribut of wizard
dron got up and wa about to sai someth but alptych interrupt
him

alptych did not insist further he had manag peopl for a long time
and knew that the chief wai to make them obei is to show no suspicion
that thei can possibl disobei have wrung a submiss i understand
from dron alptych content himself with that though he not onli
doubt but felt almost certain that without the help of troop the

could not understand them howev much she might think about them she
thought onli of on thing her sorrow which after the break caus
by care for the present seem alreadi to belong to the past now she
could rememb it and weep or prai
after sunset the wind had drop the night wa calm and fresh toward
midnight the voic began to subsid a cock crow the full moon began
to show from behind the lime tree a fresh white dewi mist began to
rise and still reign over the villag and the hous
pictur of the near pasther father ill and last momentsros
on after anoth to her memori with mourn pleasur she now linger
over these imag repel with horror onli the last on the
pictur of hi death which she felt she could not contempl even in

eyebrow and look uneasili and timidli at her
even then he want to tell me what he told me the dai he di she
thought he had alwai thought what he said then and she recal in

evid he had want to talk and why didnt he call me why didnt

soul never will that moment return for him or for me when he might have

stand close by outsid the door it wa sad and pain for him
to talk to tkhon who did not understand him i rememb how he began

perhap he would then have been comfort and would have said that word
to me and princess mari utter aloud the caress word he had said
to her on the dai of hi death dearest she repeat and began
sob with tear that reliev her soul she now saw hi face befor
her and not the face she had known ever sinc she could rememb and
had alwai seen at a distanc but the timid feebl face she had seen
for the first time quit close with all it wrinkl and detail
when she stoop near to hi mouth to catch what he said
dearest she repeat again
what wa he think when he utter that word what is he think
now thi question suddenli present itself to her and in answer she
saw him befor her with the express that wa on hi face as he lai
in hi coffin with hi chin bound up with a white handkerchief and the
horror that had seiz her when she touch him and convinc herself
that that wa not he but someth mysteri and horribl seiz her
again she tri to think of someth els and to prai but could do
neither with wideopen ey she gaze at the moonlight and the shadow
expect everi moment to see hi dead face and she felt that the
silenc brood over the hous and within it held her fast
dunysha she whisper dunysha she scream wildli and tear
herself out of thi silenc she ran to the servant quarter to meet
her old nurs and the maidserv who came run toward her

unfinish novel le chevali du cygn by madam de genli
princ andrew could not have explain how or why it wa but after that
interview with kutzov he went back to hi regiment reassur as to
the gener cours of affair and as to the man to whom it had been
entrust the more he realiz the absenc of all person motiv in
that old manin whom there seem to remain onli the habit of passion
and in place of an intellect group event and draw conclus
onli the capac calmli to contempl the cours of eventsth more
reassur he wa that everyth would be as it should he will not
bring in ani plan of hi own he will not devis or undertak
anyth thought princ andrew but he will hear everyth rememb
everyth and put everyth in it place he will not hinder
anyth us nor allow anyth harm he understand that there is

and see that signific can refrain from meddl and renounc hi
person wish direct to someth els and abov all thought princ
andrew on believ in him becaus he russian despit the novel
by genli and the french proverb and becaus hi voic shook when he
said what thei have brought us to and had a sob in it when he said
he would make them eat horseflesh

the other still more reason sai that it is too depress and
pain to think of the danger sinc it is not in man power to
forese everyth and avert the gener cours of event and it is
therefor better to disregard what is pain till it come and to
think about what is pleasant in solitud a man gener listen to

chapter xix
on the twentyfourth of august the battl of the shevrdino redoubt wa
fought on the twentyfifth not a shot wa fire by either side and on
the twentysixth the battl of borodin itself took place
why and how were the battl of shevrdino and borodin given and
accept why wa the battl of borodin fought there wa not the least
sens in it for either the french or the russian it immedi result
for the russian wa and wa bound to be that we were brought nearer
to the destruct of moscowwhich we fear more than anyth in
the world and for the french it immedi result wa that thei were
brought nearer to the destruct of their whole armywhich thei fear
more than anyth in the world what the result must be wa quit
obviou and yet napoleon offer and kutzov accept that battl
if the command had been guid by reason it would seem that it must
have been obviou to napoleon that by advanc thirteen hundr mile
and give battl with a probabl of lose a quarter of hi armi
he wa advanc to certain destruct and it must have been equal
clear to kutzov that by accept battl and risk the loss of a
quarter of hi armi he would certainli lose moscow for kutzov thi wa
mathemat clear as it is that if when plai draught i have on
man less and go on exchang i shall certainli lose and therefor
should not exchang when my oppon ha sixteen men and i have
fourteen i am onli on eighth weaker than he but when i have exchang
thirteen more men he will be three time as strong as i am
befor the battl of borodin our strength in proport to the french
wa about as five to six but after that battl it wa littl more than
on to two previous we had a hundr thousand against a hundr and
twenti thousand afterward littl more than fifti thousand against a
hundr thousand yet the shrewd and experienc kutzov accept the
battl while napoleon who wa said to be a command of geniu
gave it lose a quarter of hi armi and lengthen hi line of
commun still more if it is said that he expect to end the
campaign by occupi moscow as he had end a previou campaign by
occupi vienna there is much evid to the contrari napoleon
historian themselv tell us that from smolnsk onward he wish
to stop knew the danger of hi extend posit and knew that the
occup of moscow would not be the end of the campaign for he had
seen at smolnsk the state in which russian town were left to him and
had not receiv a singl repli to hi repeat announc of hi
wish to negoti
in give and accept battl at borodin kutzov act involuntarili
and irration but later on to fit what had occur the historian
provid cunningli devis evid of the foresight and geniu of the
gener who of all the blind tool of histori were the most enslav
and involuntari
the ancient have left us model heroic poem in which the hero furnish
the whole interest of the stori and we ar still unabl to accustom
ourselv to the fact that for our epoch histori of that kind ar
meaningless
on the other question how the battl of borodin and the preced
battl of shevrdino were fought there also exist a definit and
wellknown but quit fals concept all the historian describ the
affair as follow
the russian armi thei sai in it retreat from smolnsk sought out
for itself the best posit for a gener engag and found such a
posit at borodin
the russian thei sai fortifi thi posit in advanc on the left
of the highroad from moscow to smolnsk and almost at a right angl
to it from borodin to uttsa at the veri place where the battl wa
fought
in front of thi posit thei sai a fortifi outpost wa set up on
the shevrdino mound to observ the enemi on the twentyfourth we
ar told napoleon attack thi advanc post and took it and on the
twentysixth attack the whole russian armi which wa in posit on
the field of borodin
so the histori sai and it is all quit wrong as anyon who care to
look into the matter can easili convinc himself
the russian did not seek out the best posit but on the contrari
dure the retreat pass mani posit better than borodin thei did
not stop at ani on of these posit becaus kutzov did not wish to
occupi a posit he had not himself chosen becaus the popular demand
for a battl had not yet express itself strongli enough and becaus
milordovich had not yet arriv with the militia and for mani other
reason the fact is that other posit thei had pass were stronger
and that the posit at borodin the on where the battl wa fought
far from be strong wa no more a posit than ani other spot on
might find in the russian empir by stick a pin into the map at
hazard
not onli did the russian not fortifi the posit on the field of
borodin to the left of and at a right angl to the highroad that
is the posit on which the battl took place but never till the
twentyfifth of august 1812 did thei think that a battl might be
fought there thi wa shown first by the fact that there were no
entrench there by the twenti fifth and that those begun on the
twentyfifth and twentysixth were not complet and secondli by the
posit of the shevrdino redoubt that redoubt wa quit senseless
in front of the posit where the battl wa accept why wa it
more strongli fortifi than ani other post and why were all effort
exhaust and six thousand men sacrif to defend it till late at
night on the twentyfourth a cossack patrol would have suffic to
observ the enemi thirdli as proof that the posit on which the
battl wa fought had not been foreseen and that the shevrdino redoubt
wa not an advanc post of that posit we have the fact that up to
the twentyfifth barclai de tolli and bagratin were convinc that the
shevrdino redoubt wa the left flank of the posit and that kutzov
himself in hi report written in hot hast after the battl speak of
the shevrdino redoubt as the left flank of the posit it wa much
later when report on the battl of borodin were written at leisur
that the incorrect and extraordinari statement wa invent probabl to
justifi the mistak of a command in chief who had to be repres
as infal that the shevrdino redoubt wa an advanc postwherea
in realiti it wa simpli a fortifi point on the left flankand that
the battl of borodin wa fought by us on an entrench posit
previous select wherea it wa fought on a quit unexpect spot
which wa almost unentrench
the case wa evid thi a posit wa select along the river
kolochwhich cross the highroad not at a right angl but at an acut
angleso that the left flank wa at shevrdino the right flank near the
villag of nvoe and the center at borodin at the confluenc of the
river koloch and vyna
to anyon who look at the field of borodin without think of how
the battl wa actual fought thi posit protect by the river
koloch present itself as obviou for an armi whose object wa to
prevent an enemi from advanc along the smolnsk road to moscow
napoleon ride to valevo on the twentyfourth did not see as the
histori book sai he did the posit of the russian from uttsa
to borodin he could not have seen that posit becaus it did not
exist nor did he see an advanc post of the russian armi but while
pursu the russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the
russian positionat the shevrdino redoubtand unexpectedli for the
russian move hi armi across the koloch and the russian not have
time to begin a gener engag withdrew their left wing from the
posit thei had intend to occupi and took up a new posit which
had not been foreseen and wa not fortifi by cross to the other
side of the koloch to the left of the highroad napoleon shift the
whole forthcom battl from right to left look from the russian
side and transfer it to the plain between uttsa semnovsk and
borodina plain no more advantag as a posit than ani other plain
in russiaand there the whole battl of the twentysixth of august took
place
had napoleon not ridden out on the even of the twentyfourth to the
koloch and had he not then order an immedi attack on the redoubt
but had begun the attack next morn no on would have doubt that
the shevrdino redoubt wa the left flank of our posit and the
battl would have taken place where we expect it in that case
we should probabl have defend the shevrdino redoubtour left
flankstil more obstin we should have attack napoleon in the
center or on the right and the engag would have taken place on the
twentyfifth in the posit we intend and had fortifi but as the
attack on our left flank took place in the even after the retreat of
our rear guard that is immedi after the fight at gridnva and
as the russian command did not wish or were not in time to begin a
gener engag then on the even of the twentyfourth the first
and chief action of the battl of borodin wa alreadi lost on the
twentyfourth and obvious led to the loss of the on fought on the
twentysixth
after the loss of the shevrdino redoubt we found ourselv on the
morn of the twentyfifth without a posit for our left flank and
were forc to bend it back and hastili entrench it where it chanc to
be
not onli wa the russian armi on the twentysixth defend by weak
unfinish entrench but the disadvantag of that posit wa
increas by the fact that the russian commandersnot have fulli
realiz what had happen name the loss of our posit on the left
flank and the shift of the whole field of the forthcom battl from
right to leftmaintain their extend posit from the villag of
nvoe to uttsa and consequ had to move their forc from right to
left dure the battl so it happen that throughout the whole battl
the russian oppos the entir french armi launch against our left
flank with but half as mani men poniatowski action against uttsa
and uvrov on the right flank against the french were action
distinct from the main cours of the battl so the battl of borodin
did not take place at all as in an effort to conceal our command
mistak even at the cost of diminish the glori due to the russian
armi and peopl it ha been describ the battl of borodin wa not
fought on a chosen and entrench posit with forc onli slightli
weaker than those of the enemi but as a result of the loss of the
shevrdino redoubt the russian fought the battl of borodin on an
open and almost unentrench posit with forc onli half as numer
as the french that is to sai under condit in which it wa not
mere unthink to fight for ten hour and secur an indecis
result but unthink to keep an armi even from complet
disintegr and flight
chapter xx
on the morn of the twentyfifth pierr wa leav mozhysk at the
descent of the high steep hill down which a wind road led out of the
town past the cathedr on the right where a servic wa be held and
the bell were ring pierr got out of hi vehicl and proceed on
foot behind him a cavalri regiment wa come down the hill preced by
it singer come up toward him wa a train of cart carri men who
had been wound in the engag the dai befor the peasant driver
shout and lash their hors kept cross from side to side the
cart in each of which three or four wound soldier were ly
or sit jolt over the stone that had been thrown on the steep
inclin to make it someth like a road the wound bandag with
rag with pale cheek compress lip and knit brow held on to
the side of the cart as thei were jolt against on anoth almost
all of them stare with nave childlik curios at pierr white hat
and green swallowtail coat
pierr coachman shout angrili at the convoi of wound to keep to
on side of the road the cavalri regiment as it descend the hill
with it singer surround pierr carriag and block the road
pierr stop be press against the side of the cut in which
the road ran the sunshin from behind the hill did not penetr into
the cut and there it wa cold and damp but abov pierr head wa
the bright august sunshin and the bell sound merrili on of the
cart with wound stop by the side of the road close to pierr the
driver in hi bast shoe ran pant up to it place a stone under on
of it tireless hind wheel and began arrang the breechband on hi
littl hors
on of the wound an old soldier with a bandag arm who wa follow
the cart on foot caught hold of it with hi sound hand and turn to
look at pierr
i sai fellow countryman will thei set us down here or take us on to
moscow he ask
pierr wa so deep in thought that he did not hear the question he wa
look now at the cavalri regiment that had met the convoi of wound
now at the cart by which he wa stand in which two wound men
were sit and on wa ly on of those sit up in the cart had
probabl been wound in the cheek hi whole head wa wrap in rag
and on cheek wa swollen to the size of a babi head hi nose
and mouth were twist to on side thi soldier wa look at the
cathedr and cross himself anoth a young lad a fairhair
recruit as white as though there wa no blood in hi thin face look
at pierr kindli with a fix smile the third lai prone so that hi
face wa not visibl the cavalri singer were pass close by
ah lost quit lost is my head so keen
live in a foreign land
thei sang their soldier danc song
as if respond to them but with a differ sort of merriment the
metal sound of the bell reverber high abov and the hot rai of
the sun bath the top of the opposit slope with yet anoth sort of
merriment but beneath the slope by the cart with the wound near the
pant littl nag where pierr stood it wa damp somber and sad
the soldier with the swollen cheek look angrili at the cavalri
singer
oh the coxcomb he mutter reproachfulli
it not the soldier onli but iv seen peasant todai too
the peasantseven thei have to go said the soldier behind the cart
address pierr with a sad smile no distinct made nowadai
thei want the whole nation to fall on themin a word it moscow thei
want to make an end of it
in spite of the obscur of the soldier word pierr understood what
he want to sai and nod approv
the road wa clear again pierr descend the hill and drove on
he kept look to either side of the road for familiar face but onli
saw everywher the unfamiliar face of variou militari men of differ
branch of the servic who all look with astonish at hi white
hat and green tail coat
have gone nearli three mile he at last met an acquaint and
eagerli address him thi wa on of the head armi doctor he wa
drive toward pierr in a cover gig sit besid a young surgeon
and on recogn pierr he told the cossack who occupi the driver
seat to pull up
count your excel how come you to be here ask the doctor
well you know i want to see
ye ye there will be someth to see
pierr got out and talk to the doctor explain hi intent of
take part in a battl
the doctor advis him to appli direct to kutzov
why should you be god know where out of sight dure the battl he
said exchang glanc with hi young companion anyhow hi seren
high know you and will receiv you gracious that what you must
do
the doctor seem tire and in a hurri
you think so ah i also want to ask you where our posit is
exactli said pierr
the posit repeat the doctor well that not my line drive
past tatrinova a lot of dig is go on there go up the hillock
and youll see
can on see from there if you would
but the doctor interrupt him and move toward hi gig
i would go with you but on my honor im up to hereand he point to
hi throat im gallop to the command of the corp how do matter
stand you know count therel be a battl tomorrow out of an armi
of a hundr thousand we must expect at least twenti thousand wound
and we havent stretcher or bunk or dresser or doctor enough for
six thousand we have ten thousand cart but we need other thing as
wellw must manag as best we can
the strang thought that of the thousand of men young and old who
had stare with merri surpris at hi hat perhap the veri men he had
notic twenti thousand were inevit doom to wound and death
amaz pierr
thei mai die tomorrow why ar thei think of anyth but death
and by some latent sequenc of thought the descent of the mozhysk hill
the cart with the wound the ring bell the slant rai of the
sun and the song of the cavalrymen vividli recur to hi mind
the cavalri ride to battl and meet the wound and do not for a moment
think of what await them but pass by wink at the wound yet from
among these men twenti thousand ar doom to die and thei wonder at my
hat strang thought pierr continu hi wai to tatrinova
in front of a landown hous to the left of the road stood carriag
wagon and crowd of orderli and sentinel the command in chief
wa put up there but just when pierr arriv he wa not in and
hardli ani of the staff were therethei had gone to the church servic
pierr drove on toward grki
when he had ascend the hill and reach the littl villag street he
saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirt and with
cross on their cap who talk and laugh loudli anim and
perspir were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to the
right of the road
some of them were dig other were wheel barrowload of earth
along plank while other stood about do noth
two offic were stand on the knoll direct the men on see
these peasant who were evid still amus by the novelti of their
posit as soldier pierr onc more thought of the wound men at
mozhysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said thei
want the whole nation to fall on them the sight of these beard
peasant at work on the battlefield with their queer clumsi boot
and perspir neck and their shirt open from the left toward
the middl unfasten expos their sunburn collarbon impress
pierr more strongli with the solemn and import of the moment
than anyth he had yet seen or heard
chapter xxi
pierr step out of hi carriag and pass the toil militiamen
ascend the knoll from which accord to the doctor the battlefield
could be seen
it wa about eleven oclock the sun shone somewhat to the left and
behind him and brightli lit up the enorm panorama which rise like
an amphitheat extend befor him in the clear rarefi atmospher
from abov on the left bisect that amphitheat wound the smolnsk
highroad pass through a villag with a white church some five
hundr pace in front of the knoll and below it thi wa borodin
below the villag the road cross the river by a bridg and wind
down and up rose higher and higher to the villag of valevo visibl
about four mile awai where napoleon wa then station beyond valevo
the road disappear into a yellow forest on the horizon far in
the distanc in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road the
cross and belfri of the koloch monasteri gleam in the sun here and
there over the whole of that blue expans to right and left of the
forest and the road smoke campfir could be seen and indefinit
mass of troopsour and the enemi the ground to the rightalong the
cours of the koloch and moskv riverswa broken and hilli between
the hollow the villag of bezbova and zakhrino show in the
distanc on the left the ground wa more level there were field of
grain and the smoke ruin of semnovsk which had been burn down
could be seen
all that pierr saw wa so indefinit that neither the left nor the
right side of the field fulli satisfi hi expect nowher
could he see the battlefield he had expect to find but onli field
meadow troop wood the smoke of campfir villag mound and
stream and try as he would he could descri no militari posit in
thi place which teem with life nor could he even distinguish our
troop from the enemi
i must ask someon who know he thought and address an offic who
wa look with curios at hi huge unmilitari figur
mai i ask you said pierr what villag that is in front
brdino isnt it said the offic turn to hi companion
borodin the other correct him
the offic evid glad of an opportun for a talk move up to
pierr
ar those our men there pierr inquir
ye and there further on ar the french said the offic there
thei ar there you can see them
where where ask pierr
on can see them with the nake ey why there
the offic point with hi hand to the smoke visibl on the left
beyond the river and the same stern and seriou express that pierr
had notic on mani of the face he had met came into hi face
ah those ar the french and over there pierr point to a knoll
on the left near which some troop could be seen
those ar our
ah our and there pierr point to anoth knoll in the
distanc with a big tree on it near a villag that lai in a hollow
where also some campfir were smoke and someth black wa visibl
that hi again said the offic it wa the shevrdino redoubt
it wa our yesterdai but now it is hi

so creat an impress that the old fellow wa not much good and that
bennigsen manag everyth now the decis moment of battl had come
when kutzov would be destroi and the power pass to bennigsen or even
if kutzov won the battl it would be felt that everyth wa done by
bennigsen in ani case mani great reward would have to be given for
tomorrow action and new men would come to the front so bor wa
full of nervou vivac all dai
after kaysrov other whom pierr knew came up to him and he had not

chapter xxiii
from grki bennigsen descend the highroad to the bridg which when
thei had look at it from the hill the offic had point out as
be the center of our posit and where row of fragrant newmown hai
lai by the riversid thei rode across that bridg into the villag of
borodin and thenc turn to the left pass an enorm number of
troop and gun and came to a high knoll where militiamen were dig
thi wa the redoubt as yet unnam which afterward becam known as
the ravski redoubt or the knoll batteri but pierr paid no special
attent to it he did not know that it would becom more memor to
him than ani other spot on the plain of borodin
thei then cross the hollow to semnovsk where the soldier were
drag awai the last log from the hut and barn then thei rode
downhil and uphil across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by
hail follow a track freshli made by the artilleri over the furrow
of the plow land and reach some flche which were still be
dug
a kind of entrench
at the flche bennigsen stop and began look at the shevrdino
redoubt opposit which had been our the dai befor and where sever
horsemen could be descri the offic said that either napoleon or
murat wa there and thei all gaze eagerli at thi littl group of
horsemen pierr also look at them try to guess which of the
scarc discern figur wa napoleon at last those mount men
rode awai from the mound and disappear
bennigsen spoke to a gener who approach him and began explain
the whole posit of our troop pierr listen to him strain each
faculti to understand the essenti point of the impend battl but
wa mortifi to feel that hi mental capac wa inadequ for the
task he could make noth of it bennigsen stop speak and
notic that pierr wa listen suddenli said to him
i dont think thi interest you
on the contrari it veri interest repli pierr not quit
truthfulli
from the flche thei rode still farther to the left along a road
wind through a thick lowgrow birch wood in the middl of the
wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and scare by the tramp of
the mani hors grew so confus that it leap along the road in front
of them for some time arous gener attent and laughter and onli
when sever voic shout at it did it dart to on side and disappear
in the thicket after go through the wood for about a mile and a half
thei came out on a glade where troop of tchkov corp were station
to defend the left flank
here at the extrem left flank bennigsen talk a great deal and with
much heat and as it seem to pierr gave order of great militari
import in front of tchkov troop wa some high ground not
occupi by troop bennigsen loudli critic thi mistak sai
that it wa mad to leav a height which command the countri around
unoccupi and to place troop below it some of the gener express
the same opinion on in particular declar with martial heat that thei
were put there to be slaughter bennigsen on hi own author order
the troop to occupi the high ground thi disposit on the left flank
increas pierr doubt of hi own capac to understand militari
matter listen to bennigsen and the gener critic the
posit of the troop behind the hill he quit understood them and
share their opinion but for that veri reason he could not understand
how the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so gross
and palpabl a blunder
pierr did not know that these troop were not as bennigsen suppos
put there to defend the posit but were in a conceal posit as
an ambush that thei should not be seen and might be abl to strike an
approach enemi unexpectedli bennigsen did not know thi and move
the troop forward accord to hi own idea without mention the
matter to the command in chief
chapter xxiv
on that bright even of august 25 princ andrew lai lean on hi
elbow in a brokendown shed in the villag of knyazkvo at the further
end of hi regiment encamp through a gap in the broken wall he
could see besid the wooden fenc a row of thirtyyearold birch
with their lower branch lop off a field on which shock of
oat were stand and some bush near which rose the smoke of
campfiresth soldier kitchen
narrow and burdensom and useless to anyon as hi life now seem to
him princ andrew on the ev of battl felt agit and irrit as
he had done seven year befor at austerlitz
he had receiv and given the order for next dai battl and had
noth more to do but hi thoughtsth simplest clearest and
therefor most terribl thoughtswould give him no peac he knew that
tomorrow battl would be the most terribl of all he had taken
part in and for the first time in hi life the possibl of death
present itself to himnot in relat to ani worldli matter or with
refer to it effect on other but simpli in relat to himself to
hi own soulvividli plainli terribl and almost as a certainti and
from the height of thi percept all that had previous torment and
preoccupi him suddenli becam illumin by a cold white light without
shadow without perspect without distinct of outlin all life
appear to him like magiclantern pictur at which he had long been
gaze by artifici light through a glass now he suddenli saw those
badli daub pictur in clear daylight and without a glass ye
ye there thei ar those fals imag that agit enraptur
and torment me said he to himself pass in review the princip
pictur of the magic lantern of life and regard them now in the cold
white daylight of hi clear percept of death there thei ar those
rude paint figur that onc seem splendid and mysteri
glori the good of societi love of a woman the fatherland itselfhow
import these pictur appear to me with what profound mean thei
seem to be fill and it is all so simpl pale and crude in the
cold white light of thi morn which i feel is dawn for me the
three great sorrow of hi life held hi attent in particular hi
love for a woman hi father death and the french invas which had
overrun half russia love that littl girl who seem to me brim
over with mystic forc ye inde i love her i made romant plan
of love and happi with her oh what a boi i wa he said aloud
bitterli ah me i believ in some ideal love which wa to keep her
faith to me for the whole year of my absenc like the gentl dove
in the fabl she wa to pine apart from me but it wa much simpler
realli it wa all veri simpl and horribl
when my father built bald hill he thought the place wa hi hi
land hi air hi peasant but napoleon came and swept him asid
unconsci of hi exist as he might brush a chip from hi path
and hi bald hill and hi whole life fell to piec princess mari sai
it is a trial sent from abov what is the trial for when he is not
here and will never return he is not here for whom then is the trial
intend the fatherland the destruct of moscow and tomorrow i
shall be kill perhap not even by a frenchman but by on of our own
men by a soldier discharg a musket close to my ear as on of them
did yesterdai and the french will come and take me by head and heel
and fling me into a hole that i mai not stink under their nose and new
condit of life will aris which will seem quit ordinari to other
and about which i shall know noth i shall not exist
he look at the row of birch shine in the sunshin with their
motionless green and yellow foliag and white bark to die to be
kill tomorrow that i should not exist that all thi should still
be but no me
and the birch with their light and shade the curli cloud the
smoke of the campfir and all that wa around him chang and seem
terribl and menac a cold shiver ran down hi spine he rose
quickli went out of the shed and began to walk about
after he had return voic were heard outsid the shed who that
he cri
the rednos captain timkhin formerli dlokhov squadron command
but now from lack of offic a battalion command shyli enter the
shed follow by an adjut and the regiment paymast
princ andrew rose hastili listen to the busi thei had come
about gave them some further instruct and wa about to dismiss
them when he heard a familiar lisp voic behind the shed
devil take it said the voic of a man stumbl over someth
princ andrew look out of the shed and saw pierr who had trip
over a pole on the ground and had nearli fallen come hi wai it wa
unpleas to princ andrew to meet peopl of hi own set in gener
and pierr especi for he remind him of all the pain moment of
hi last visit to moscow
you what a surpris said he what bring you here thi is
unexpect
as he said thi hi ey and face express more than coldnessthei
express hostil which pierr notic at onc he had approach
the shed full of anim but on see princ andrew face he felt
constrain and ill at eas
i have come simpli you know come it interest me said
pierr who had so often that dai senselessli repeat that word
interest i wish to see the battl

my peopl have thei reach moscow at last he ask serious

chapter xxv
the offic were about to take leav but princ andrew appar
reluct to be left alon with hi friend ask them to stai and have
tea seat were brought in and so wa the tea the offic gaze with
surpris at pierr huge stout figur and listen to hi talk of
moscow and the posit of our armi round which he had ridden princ
andrew remain silent and hi express wa so forbid that pierr
address hi remark chiefli to the goodnatur battalion command
so you understand the whole posit of our troop princ andrew
interrupt him
yesthat is how do you mean said pierr not be a militari man
i cant sai i have understood it fulli but i understand the gener
posit
well then you know more than anyon els be it who it mai said
princ andrew
oh said pierr look over hi spectacl in perplex at princ
andrew well and what do you think of kutzov appoint he
ask
i wa veri glad of hi appoint that all i know repli princ
andrew
and tell me your opinion of barclai de tolli in moscow thei ar sai
heaven know what about him what do you think of him
ask them repli princ andrew indic the offic
pierr look at timkhin with the condescendingli interrog smile
with which everybodi involuntarili address that offic
we see light again sinc hi seren ha been appoint your
excel said timkhin timidli and continu turn to glanc at
hi colonel
why so ask pierr
well to mention onli firewood and fodder let me inform you why when
we were retreat from sventsyni we dare not touch a stick or a wisp
of hai or anyth you see we were go awai so he would get it all
wasnt it so your excel and again timkhin turn to the princ
but we darent in our regiment two offic were courtmarti for
that kind of thing but when hi seren took command everyth becam
straightforward now we see light
then why wa it forbidden
timkhin look about in confus not know what or how to answer
such a question pierr put the same question to princ andrew
why so as not to lai wast the countri we were abandon to the
enemi said princ andrew with venom ironi it is veri sound
on cant permit the land to be pillag and accustom the troop to
maraud at smolnsk too he judg correctli that the french might
outflank us as thei had larger forc but he could not understand
thi cri princ andrew in a shrill voic that seem to escap him
involuntarili he could not understand that there for the first time
we were fight for russian soil and that there wa a spirit in the
men such as i had never seen befor that we had held the french for
two dai and that that success had increas our strength tenfold he
order us to retreat and all our effort and loss went for noth
he had no thought of betrai us he tri to do the best he could
he thought out everyth and that is why he is unsuit he is
unsuit now just becaus he plan out everyth veri thoroughli and
accur as everi german ha to how can i explain well sai your
father ha a german valet and he is a splendid valet and satisfi your
father requir better than you could then it all right to let
him serv but if your father is mortal sick youll send the valet
awai and attend to your father with your own unpract awkward hand
and will sooth him better than a skill man who is a stranger could
so it ha been with barclai while russia wa well a foreign could
serv her and be a splendid minist but as soon as she is in danger
she need on of her own kin but in your club thei have been make him
out a traitor thei slander him as a traitor and the onli result will
be that afterward asham of their fals accus thei will make
him out a hero or a geniu instead of a traitor and that will be still
more unjust he is an honest and veri punctili german
and thei sai he a skill command rejoin pierr
i dont understand what is meant by a skill command repli
princ andrew iron
a skill command repli pierr why on who forese all
conting and forese the adversari intent
but that imposs said princ andrew as if it were a matter
settl long ago
pierr look at him in surpris
and yet thei sai that war is like a game of chess he remark
ye repli princ andrew but with thi littl differ that
in chess you mai think over each move as long as you pleas and ar not
limit for time and with thi differ too that a knight is alwai
stronger than a pawn and two pawn ar alwai stronger than on while
in war a battalion is sometim stronger than a divis and sometim
weaker than a compani the rel strength of bodi of troop can
never be known to anyon believ me he went on if thing
depend on arrang made by the staff i should be there make
arrang but instead of that i have the honor to serv here in
the regiment with these gentlemen and i consid that on us tomorrow
battl will depend and not on those other success never depend
and never will depend on posit or equip or even on number
and least of all on posit
but on what then
on the feel that is in me and in him he point to timkhin and
in each soldier
princ andrew glanc at timkhin who look at hi command in alarm
and bewilder in contrast to hi former retic taciturn
princ andrew now seem excit he could appar not refrain from
express the thought that had suddenli occur to him
a battl is won by those who firmli resolv to win it why did we lose
the battl at austerlitz the french loss were almost equal to our
but veri earli we said to ourselv that we were lose the battl
and we did lose it and we said so becaus we had noth to fight for
there we want to get awai from the battlefield as soon as we could
weve lost so let us run and we ran if we had not said that till
the even heaven know what might not have happen but tomorrow we
shant sai it you talk about our posit the left flank weak and the
right flank too extend he went on that all nonsens there
noth of the kind but what await us tomorrow a hundr million most
divers chanc which will be decid on the instant by the fact that
our men or their run or do not run and that thi man or that man is
kill but all that is be done at present is onli plai the fact is
that those men with whom you have ridden round the posit not onli
do not help matter but hinder thei ar onli concern with their own
petti interest
at such a moment said pierr reproachfulli
at such a moment princ andrew repeat to them it is onli a moment
afford opportun to undermin a rival and obtain an extra cross
or ribbon for me tomorrow mean thi a russian armi of a hundr
thousand and a french armi of a hundr thousand have met to fight and
the thing is that these two hundr thousand men will fight and the side
that fight more fierc and spare itself least will win and if you
like i will tell you that whatev happen and whatev muddl those at
the top mai make we shall win tomorrow battl tomorrow happen what
mai we shall win
there now your excel that the truth the real truth said
timkhin who would spare himself now the soldier in my battalion
believ me wouldnt drink their vodka it not the dai for that
thei sai
all were silent the offic rose princ andrew went out of the shed
with them give final order to the adjut after thei had gone
pierr approach princ andrew and wa about to start a convers
when thei heard the clatter of three hors hoof on the road not far
from the shed and look in that direct princ andrew recogn
wolzogen and clausewitz accompani by a cossack thei rode close by
continu to convers and princ andrew involuntarili heard these
word
der krieg muss in raum verlegt werden der ansicht kann ich nicht genug
prei geben said on of them
the war must be extend wide i cannot suffici
commend that view
oh ja said the other der zweck ist nur den feind zu schwchen
so kann man gewiss nicht den verlust der privatpersonen in achtung
nehmen
oh ye the onli aim is to weaken the enemi so of
cours on cannot take into account the loss of privat
individu
oh no agre the other
extend wide said princ andrew with an angri snort when thei had
ridden past in that extend were my father son and sister at bald
hill that all the same to him that what i wa sai to youthos
german gentlemen wont win the battl tomorrow but will onli make all
the mess thei can becaus thei have noth in their german head but
theori not worth an empti eggshel and havent in their heart the on
thing need tomorrowthat which timkhin ha thei have yield up all
europ to him and have now come to teach us fine teacher and again
hi voic grew shrill
so you think we shall win tomorrow battl ask pierr
ye ye answer princ andrew absent on thing i would do if
i had the power he began again i would not take prison why take
prison it chivalri the french have destroi my home and ar on
their wai to destroi moscow thei have outrag and ar outrag me
everi moment thei ar my enemi in my opinion thei ar all crimin
and so think timkhin and the whole armi thei should be execut
sinc thei ar my foe thei cannot be my friend whatev mai have been
said at tilsit
ye ye mutter pierr look with shine ey at princ andrew
i quit agre with you
the question that had perturb pierr on the mozhysk hill and all
that dai now seem to him quit clear and complet solv he now
understood the whole mean and import of thi war and of the
impend battl all he had seen that dai all the signific and
stern express on the face he had seen in pass were lit up
for him by a new light he understood that latent heat as thei sai in
physic of patriot which wa present in all these men he had seen
and thi explain to him why thei all prepar for death calmli and as
it were lightheartedli
not take prison princ andrew continu that by itself would
quit chang the whole war and make it less cruel as it is we have
plai at warthat what vile we plai at magnanim and all that
stuff such magnanim and sensibl ar like the magnanim and
sensibl of a ladi who faint when she see a calf be kill she
is so kindheart that she cant look at blood but enjoi eat the
calf serv up with sauc thei talk to us of the rule of war of
chivalri of flag of truce of merci to the unfortun and so on it
all rubbish i saw chivalri and flag of truce in 1805 thei humbug
us and we humbug them thei plunder other peopl hous issu
fals paper monei and worst of all thei kill my children and my
father and then talk of rule of war and magnanim to foe take no
prison but kill and be kill he who ha come to thi as i have
through the same suffer
princ andrew who had thought it wa all the same to him whether or
not moscow wa taken as smolnsk had been wa suddenli check in hi
speech by an unexpect cramp in hi throat he pace up and down a
few time in silenc but hi ey glitter feverishli and hi lip
quiver as he began speak
if there wa none of thi magnanim in war we should go to war onli
when it wa worth while go to certain death as now then there would
not be war becaus paul ivnovich had offend michael ivnovich and
when there wa a war like thi on it would be war and then the
determin of the troop would be quit differ then all these
westphalian and hessian whom napoleon is lead would not follow
him into russia and we should not go to fight in austria and prussia
without know why war is not courtesi but the most horribl thing in
life and we ought to understand that and not plai at war we ought to
accept thi terribl necess sternli and serious it all li in
that get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game as it is
now war is the favorit pastim of the idl and frivol the militari

though it wa not clear what the artist meant to express by depict
the socal king of rome spike the earth with a stick the allegori

the king of rome he said point to the portrait with a grace

chapter xxvii
on the twentyfifth of august so hi historian tell us napoleon spent
the whole dai on horseback inspect the local consid plan
submit to him by hi marshal and person give command to hi
gener
the origin line of the russian forc along the river koloch had
been disloc by the captur of the shevrdino redoubt on the
twentyfourth and part of the lineth left flankhad been drawn back
that part of the line wa not entrench and in front of it the ground
wa more open and level than elsewher it wa evid to anyon
militari or not that it wa here the french should attack it would
seem that not much consider wa need to reach thi conclus
nor ani particular care or troubl on the part of the emperor and hi
marshal nor wa there ani need of that special and suprem qualiti
call geniu that peopl ar so apt to ascrib to napoleon yet the
historian who describ the event later and the men who then surround
napoleon and he himself thought otherwis
napoleon rode over the plain and survei the local with a profound
air and in silenc nod with approv or shook hi head dubious
and without commun to the gener around him the profound
cours of idea which guid hi decis mere gave them hi final
conclus in the form of command have listen to a suggest
from davout who wa now call princ deckmhl to turn the russian
left wing napoleon said it should not be done without explain
why not to a propos made by gener campan who wa to attack the
flche to lead hi divis through the wood napoleon agre though
the socal duke of elchingen nei ventur to remark that a movement
through the wood wa danger and might disord the divis
have inspect the countri opposit the shevrdino redoubt napoleon
ponder a littl in silenc and then indic the spot where two
batteri should be set up by the morrow to act against the russian
entrench and the place where in line with them the field
artilleri should be place
after give these and other command he return to hi tent and the
disposit for the battl were written down from hi dictat
these disposit of which the french historian write with enthusiasm
and other historian with profound respect were as follow
at dawn the two new batteri establish dure the night on the
plain occupi by the princ deckmhl will open fire on the oppos
batteri of the enemi
at the same time the command of the artilleri of the 1st corp
gener pernetti with thirti cannon of campan divis and all the
howitz of dessaix and friant divis will move forward open
fire and overwhelm with shellfir the enemi batteri against which
will oper
24 gun of the artilleri of the guard
30 gun of campan divis
and 8 gun of friant and dessaix divis
in all 62 gun
the command of the artilleri of the 3rd corp gener fouch will
place the howitz of the 3rd and 8th corp sixteen in all on the
flank of the batteri that is to bombard the entrench on the left
which will have forti gun in all direct against it
gener sorbier must be readi at the first order to advanc with all the
howitz of the guard artilleri against either on or other of the
entrench
dure the cannonad princ poniatowski is to advanc through the wood
on the villag and turn the enemi posit
gener campan will move through the wood to seiz the first
fortif
after the advanc ha begun in thi manner order will be given in
accord with the enemi movement
the cannonad on the left flank will begin as soon as the gun of the
right wing ar heard the sharpshoot of morand divis and of
the vicek divis will open a heavi fire on see the attack
commenc on the right wing
the vicek will occupi the villag and cross by it three bridg
advanc to the same height as morand and gibrard divis which
under hi leadership will be direct against the redoubt and come into
line with the rest of the forc
all thi must be done in good order le tout se fera avec ordr et
mthode as far as possibl retain troop in reserv
the imperi camp near mozhysk
septemb 6 1812
these disposit which ar veri obscur and confus if on allow
oneself to regard the arrang without religi aw of hi geniu
relat to napoleon order to deal with four pointsfour differ
order not on of these wa or could be carri out
in the disposit it is said first that the batteri place on the
spot chosen by napoleon with the gun of pernetti and fouch which
were to come in line with them 102 gun in all were to open fire and
shower shell on the russian flche and redoubt thi could not be
done as from the spot select by napoleon the projectil did not
carri to the russian work and those 102 gun shot into the air until
the nearest command contrari to napoleon instruct move them
forward
the second order wa that poniatowski move to the villag through the
wood should turn the russian left flank thi could not be done and
wa not done becaus poniatowski advanc on the villag through the
wood met tchkov there bar hi wai and could not and did not turn
the russian posit
the third order wa gener campan will move through the wood to seiz
the first fortif gener campan divis did not seiz the
first fortif but wa driven back for on emerg from the wood
it had to reform under grapeshot of which napoleon wa unawar
the fourth order wa the vicek will occupi the villag borodin
and cross by it three bridg advanc to the same height as
morand and grard divis for whose movement no direct ar
given which under hi leadership will be direct against the redoubt
and come into line with the rest of the forc
as far as on can make out not so much from thi unintellig
sentenc as from the attempt the vicek made to execut the order
given him he wa to advanc from the left through borodin to the
redoubt while the divis of morand and grard were to advanc
simultan from the front
all thi like the other part of the disposit wa not and could
not be execut after pass through borodin the vicek wa driven
back to the koloch and could get no farther while the divis of
morand and grard did not take the redoubt but were driven back and the
redoubt wa onli taken at the end of the battl by the cavalri a thing
probabl unforeseen and not heard of by napoleon so not on of
the order in the disposit wa or could be execut but in the
disposit it is said that after the fight ha commenc in thi
manner order will be given in accord with the enemi movement
and so it might be suppos that all necessari arrang would be
made by napoleon dure the battl but thi wa not and could not be
done for dure the whole battl napoleon wa so far awai that as
appear later he could not know the cours of the battl and not on
of hi order dure the fight could be execut
chapter xxviii
mani historian sai that the french did not win the battl of borodin
becaus napoleon had a cold and that if he had not had a cold the
order he gave befor and dure the battl would have been still more
full of geniu and russia would have been lost and the face of the world
have been chang to historian who believ that russia wa shape
by the will of on manpet the greatand that franc from a republ
becam an empir and french armi went to russia at the will of on
mannapoleonto sai that russia remain a power becaus napoleon had a
bad cold on the twentyfourth of august mai seem logic and convinc
if it had depend on napoleon will to fight or not to fight the
battl of borodin and if thi or that other arrang depend on
hi will then evid a cold affect the manifest of hi will
might have save russia and consequ the valet who omit to bring
napoleon hi waterproof boot on the twentyfourth would have been
the savior of russia along that line of thought such a deduct is
indubit as indubit as the deduct voltair made in jest
without know what he wa jest at when he saw that the massacr
of st bartholomew wa due to charl ix stomach be derang but
to men who do not admit that russia wa form by the will of on man
peter i or that the french empir wa form and the war with russia
begun by the will of on man napoleon that argument seem not mere
untru and irrat but contrari to all human realiti to the
question of what caus histor event anoth answer present itself
name that the cours of human event is predetermin from on
highdepend on the coincid of the will of all who take part in the
event and that a napoleon influenc on the cours of these event is
pure extern and fictiti
strang as at first glanc it mai seem to suppos that the massacr of
st bartholomew wa not due to charl ix will though he gave the
order for it and thought it wa done as a result of that order and
strang as it mai seem to suppos that the slaughter of eighti thousand
men at borodin wa not due to napoleon will though he order the
commenc and conduct of the battl and thought it wa done
becaus he order it strang as these supposit appear yet human
dignitywhich tell me that each of us is if not more at least not less
a man than the great napoleondemand the accept of that solut of
the question and histor investig abundantli confirm it
at the battl of borodin napoleon shot at no on and kill no on
that wa all done by the soldier therefor it wa not he who kill
peopl
the french soldier went to kill and be kill at the battl of borodin
not becaus of napoleon order but by their own volit the whole
armyfrench italian german polish and dutchhungri rag and
weari of the campaign felt at the sight of an armi block their road
to moscow that the wine wa drawn and must be drunk had napoleon then
forbidden them to fight the russian thei would have kill him and
have proceed to fight the russian becaus it wa inevit
when thei heard napoleon proclam offer them as compens
for mutil and death the word of poster about their have been
in the battl befor moscow thei cri vive lempereur just as thei
had cri vive lempereur at the sight of the portrait of the boi
pierc the terrestri globe with a toi stick and just as thei would
have cri vive lempereur at ani nonsens that might be told them
there wa noth left for them to do but cry vive lempereur and go
to fight in order to get food and rest as conqueror in moscow so it
wa not becaus of napoleon command that thei kill their fellow
men
and it wa not napoleon who direct the cours of the battl for none
of hi order were execut and dure the battl he did not know what
wa go on befor him so the wai in which these peopl kill on
anoth wa not decid by napoleon will but occur independ of
him in accord with the will of hundr of thousand of peopl who took
part in the common action it onli seem to napoleon that it all took
place by hi will and so the question whether he had or had not a
cold ha no more histor interest than the cold of the least of the
transport soldier
moreov the assert made by variou writer that hi cold wa
the caus of hi disposit not be as wellplan as on former
occas and of hi order dure the battl not be as good as
previous is quit baseless which again show that napoleon cold on
the twentysixth of august wa unimport
the disposit cite abov ar not at all wors but ar even
better than previou disposit by which he had won victori hi
pseudoord dure the battl were also no wors than formerli but
much the same as usual these disposit and order onli seem wors
than previou on becaus the battl of borodin wa the first napoleon
did not win the profoundest and most excel disposit and order
seem veri bad and everi learn militarist critic them with look
of import when thei relat to a battl that ha been lost and the
veri worst disposit and order seem veri good and seriou peopl
fill whole volum to demonstr their merit when thei relat to a
battl that ha been won
the disposit drawn up by weyroth for the battl of austerlitz were
a model of perfect for that kind of composit but still thei were
criticizedcritic for their veri perfect for their excess
minut
napoleon at the battl of borodin fulfil hi offic as
repres of author as well as and even better than at other
battl he did noth harm to the progress of the battl he
inclin to the most reason opinion he made no confus did not
contradict himself did not get frighten or run awai from the field of
battl but with hi great tact and militari experi carri out hi
role of appear to command calmli and with digniti
chapter xxix
on return from a second inspect of the line napoleon remark

pierr went to the batteri and the adjut rode on thei did not meet
again and onli much later did pierr learn that he lost an arm that
dai
the knoll to which pierr ascend wa that famou on afterward known
to the russian as the knoll batteri or ravski redoubt and to the
french as la grand redout la fatal redout la redout du centr
around which ten of thousand fell and which the french regard as
the kei to the whole posit
thi redoubt consist of a knoll on three side of which trench had
been dug within the entrench stood ten gun that were be fire
through open in the earthwork
in line with the knoll on both side stood other gun which also fire
incessantli a littl behind the gun stood infantri when ascend
that knoll pierr had no notion that thi spot on which small trench
had been dug and from which a few gun were fire wa the most
import point of the battl
on the contrari just becaus he happen to be there he thought it on
of the least signific part of the field
have reach the knoll pierr sat down at on end of a trench
surround the batteri and gaze at what wa go on around him with
an unconsci happi smile occasion he rose and walk about the
batteri still with that same smile try not to obstruct the soldier
who were load haul the gun and continu run past
him with bag and charg the gun of that batteri were be fire
continu on after anoth with a deafen roar envelop the
whole neighborhood in powder smoke
in contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen place in support
here in the batteri where a small number of men busi at their work were
separ from the rest by a trench everyon experienc a common and
as it were famili feel of anim
the intrus of pierr nonmilitari figur in a white hat made an
unpleas impress at first the soldier look askanc at him with
surpris and even alarm as thei went past him the senior artilleri
offic a tall longleg pockmark man move over to pierr as if
to see the action of the farthest gun and look at him with curios
a young roundfac offic quit a boi still and evid onli just
out of the cadet colleg who wa zealous command the two gun
entrust to him address pierr sternli
sir he said permit me to ask you to stand asid you must not be
here
the soldier shook their head disapprovingli as thei look at pierr
but when thei had convinc themselv that thi man in the white hat
wa do no harm but either sat quietli on the slope of the trench
with a shy smile or polit make wai for the soldier pace up
and down the batteri under fire as calmli as if he were on a boulevard
their feel of hostil distrust gradual began to chang into a
kindli and banter sympathi such as soldier feel for their dog
cock goat and in gener for the anim that live with the
regiment the men soon accept pierr into their famili adopt him
gave him a nicknam our gentleman and made kindli fun of him among
themselv
a shell tore up the earth two pace from pierr and he look around
with a smile as he brush from hi cloth some earth it had thrown up
and how it your not afraid sir realli now a redfac

as the flame of the fire hidden within come more and more vividli and
rapidli from an approach thundercloud so as if in opposit to
what wa take place the lightn of hidden fire grow more and
more intens glow in the face of these men
pierr did not look out at the battlefield and wa not concern to know
what wa happen there he wa entir absorb in watch thi fire
which burn ever more brightli and which he felt wa flame up in the
same wai in hi own soul
at ten oclock the infantri that had been among the bush in front of

so as to be less expos to fire after thi from amid the rank of
infantri to the right of the batteri came the sound of a drum and shout
of command and from the batteri on saw how those rank of infantri

pierr look over the wall of the trench and wa particularli struck
by a pale young offic who let hi sword hang down wa walk
backward and kept glanc uneasili around

besid himself with terror pierr jump up and ran back to the batteri
as to the onli refug from the horror that surround him
on enter the earthwork he notic that there were men do someth
there but that no shot were be fire from the batteri he had no
time to realiz who these men were he saw the senior offic ly on
the earth wall with hi back turn as if he were examin someth

struggl forward shout brother and try to free himself from
some men who were hold him by the arm he also saw someth els

but he had not time to realiz that the colonel had been kill that
the soldier shout brother wa a prison and that anoth man
had been bayonet in the back befor hi ey for hardli had he run
into the redoubt befor a thin sallowfac perspir man in a blue
uniform rush on him sword in hand shout someth instinct
guard against the shockfor thei had been run togeth at full
speed befor thei saw on anotherpierr put out hi hand and seiz
the man a french offic by the shoulder with on hand and by the
throat with the other the offic drop hi sword seiz pierr by
hi collar
for some second thei gaze with frighten ey at on anoth
unfamiliar face and both were perplex at what thei had done and
what thei were to do next am i taken prison or have i taken him
prison each wa think but the french offic wa evid more
inclin to think he had been taken prison becaus pierr strong
hand impel by instinct fear squeez hi throat ever tighter and
tighter the frenchman wa about to sai someth when just abov their
head terribl and low a cannon ball whistl and it seem to pierr
that the french offic head had been torn off so swiftli had he
duck it
pierr too bent hi head and let hi hand fall without further thought
as to who had taken whom prison the frenchman ran back to the batteri
and pierr ran down the slope stumbl over the dead and wound who
it seem to him caught at hi feet but befor he reach the foot
of the knoll he wa met by a dens crowd of russian soldier who
stumbl trip up and shout ran merrili and wildli toward
the batteri thi wa the attack for which ermlov claim the credit
declar that onli hi courag and good luck made such a feat possibl
it wa the attack in which he wa said to have thrown some st georg
cross he had in hi pocket into the batteri for the first soldier to
take who got there
the french who had occupi the batteri fled and our troop shout
hurrah pursu them so far beyond the batteri that it wa difficult
to call them back
the prison were brought down from the batteri and among them wa
a wound french gener whom the offic surround crowd of
woundedsom known to pierr and some unknownrussian and french
with face distort by suffer walk crawl and were carri on
stretcher from the batteri pierr again went up onto the knoll where
he had spent over an hour and of that famili circl which had receiv
him as a member he did not find a singl on there were mani dead whom
he did not know but some he recogn the young offic still sat in
the same wai bent doubl in a pool of blood at the edg of the earth
wall the redfac man wa still twitch but thei did not carri him
awai
pierr ran down the slope onc more
now thei will stop it now thei will be horrifi at what thei have
done he thought aimlessli go toward a crowd of stretcher bearer
move from the battlefield
but behind the veil of smoke the sun wa still high and in front and
especi to the left near semnovsk someth seem to be seeth
in the smoke and the roar of cannon and musketri did not diminish but
even increas to desper like a man who strain himself shriek
with all hi remain strength
chapter xxxiii
the chief action of the battl of borodin wa fought within the seven
thousand feet between borodin and bagratin flche beyond that
space there wa on the on side a demonstr made by the russian
with uvrov cavalri at middai and on the other side beyond uttsa
poniatowski collis with tchkov but these two were detach and
feebl action in comparison with what took place in the center of the
battlefield on the field between borodin and the flche besid the
wood the chief action of the dai took place on an open space visibl
from both side and wa fought in the simplest and most artless wai
the battl began on both side with a cannonad from sever hundr
gun
then when the whole field wa cover with smoke two divis
campan and dessaix advanc from the french right while murat
troop advanc on borodin from their left
from the shevrdino redoubt where napoleon wa stand the flche were
two third of a mile awai and it wa more than a mile as the crow fli
to borodin so that napoleon could not see what wa happen there
especi as the smoke mingl with the mist hid the whole local
the soldier of dessaix divis advanc against the flche could
onli be seen till thei had enter the hollow that lai between them and
the flche as soon as thei had descend into that hollow the smoke
of the gun and musketri on the flche grew so dens that it cover
the whole approach on that side of it through the smoke glimps could
be caught of someth blackprob menand at time the glint of
bayonet but whether thei were move or stationari whether thei were
french or russian could not be discov from the shevrdino redoubt
the sun had risen brightli and it slant rai struck straight into
napoleon face as shade hi ey with hi hand he look at the
flche the smoke spread out befor them and at time it look as if
the smoke were move at time as if the troop move sometim shout
were heard through the fire but it wa imposs to tell what wa
be done there
napoleon stand on the knoll look through a field glass and in
it small circlet saw smoke and men sometim hi own and sometim
russian but when he look again with the nake ey he could not tell
where what he had seen wa
he descend the knoll and began walk up and down befor it
occasion he stop listen to the fire and gaze intent at
the battlefield
but not onli wa it imposs to make out what wa happen from where
he wa stand down below or from the knoll abov on which some of hi
gener had taken their stand but even from the flche themselvesin
which by thi time there were now russian and now french soldier
altern or togeth dead wound aliv frighten or
maddenedeven at those flche themselv it wa imposs to make out
what wa take place there for sever hour amid incess cannon and
musketri fire now russian were seen alon now frenchmen alon now
infantri and now cavalri thei appear fire fell collid not
know what to do with on anoth scream and ran back again
from the battlefield adjut he had sent out and orderli from hi
marshal kept gallop up to napoleon with report of the progress
of the action but all these report were fals both becaus it wa
imposs in the heat of battl to sai what wa happen at ani given
moment and becaus mani of the adjut did not go to the actual place
of conflict but report what thei had heard from other and also
becaus while an adjut wa ride more than a mile to napoleon
circumst chang and the new he brought wa alreadi becom
fals thu an adjut gallop up from murat with tide that
borodin had been occupi and the bridg over the koloch wa in the
hand of the french the adjut ask whether napoleon wish the
troop to cross it napoleon gave order that the troop should form up
on the farther side and wait but befor that order wa givenalmost
as soon in fact as the adjut had left borodinth bridg had been
retaken by the russian and burn in the veri skirmish at which pierr
had been present at the begin of the battl
an adjut gallop up from the flche with a pale and frighten face
and report to napoleon that their attack had been repuls campan
wound and davout kill yet at the veri time the adjut had been
told that the french had been repuls the flche had in fact been
recaptur by other french troop and davout wa aliv and onli
slightli bruis on the basi of these necessarili untrustworthi
report napoleon gave hi order which had either been execut befor
he gave them or could not be and were not execut
the marshal and gener who were nearer to the field of battl
but like napoleon did not take part in the actual fight and onli
occasion went within musket rang made their own arrang
without ask napoleon and issu order where and in what direct to
fire and where cavalri should gallop and infantri should run but even
their order like napoleon were seldom carri out and then but
partial for the most part thing happen contrari to their order
soldier order to advanc ran back on meet grapeshot soldier
order to remain where thei were suddenli see russian
unexpectedli befor them sometim rush back and sometim forward
and the cavalri dash without order in pursuit of the fly russian
in thi wai two cavalri regiment gallop through the semnovsk hollow
and as soon as thei reach the top of the inclin turn round and
gallop full speed back again the infantri move in the same wai
sometim run to quit other place than those thei were order to
go to all order as to where and when to move the gun when to send
infantri to shoot or horsemen to ride down the russian infantryal
such order were given by the offic on the spot nearest to the
unit concern without ask either nei davout or murat much less
napoleon thei did not fear get into troubl for not fulfil
order or for act on their own initi for in battl what is at
stake is what is dearest to manhi own lifeand it sometim seem that
safeti li in run back sometim in run forward and these men
who were right in the heat of the battl act accord to the mood
of the moment in realiti howev all these movement forward and
backward did not improv or alter the posit of the troop all
their rush and gallop at on anoth did littl harm the harm of
disabl and death wa caus by the ball and bullet that flew over
the field on which these men were flounder about as soon as thei
left the place where the ball and bullet were fly about their
superior locat in the background reform them and brought them
under disciplin and under the influenc of that disciplin led them
back to the zone of fire where under the influenc of fear of death
thei lost their disciplin and rush about accord to the chanc
prompt of the throng
chapter xxxiv
napoleon generalsdavout nei and murat who were near that region of
fire and sometim even enter itrepeatedli led into it huge mass of
wellord troop but contrari to what had alwai happen in their
former battl instead of the new thei expect of the enemi flight
these orderli mass return thenc as disorgan and terrifi mob
the gener reform them but their number constantli decreas
in the middl of the dai murat sent hi adjut to napoleon to demand
reinforc
napoleon sat at the foot of the knoll drink punch when murat
adjut gallop up with an assur that the russian would be rout
if hi majesti would let him have anoth divis
reinforc said napoleon in a tone of stern surpris look at
the adjutanta handsom lad with long black curl arrang like murat
owna though he did not understand hi word
reinforc thought napoleon to himself how can thei need
reinforc when thei alreadi have half the armi direct against a
weak unentrench russian wing
tell the king of napl said he sternli that it is not noon yet

lose
hi troop were the same hi gener the same the same prepar
had been made the same disposit and the same proclam court
et nergiqu he himself wa still the same he knew that and knew that
he wa now even more experienc and skill than befor even the
enemi wa the same as at austerlitz and friedlandyet the terribl
stroke of hi arm had supernatur becom impot
all the old method that had been unfailingli crown with success the
concentr of batteri on on point an attack by reserv to break
the enemi line and a cavalri attack by the men of iron all these
method had alreadi been emploi yet not onli wa there no victori
but from all side came the same new of gener kill and wound
of reinforc need of the imposs of drive back the
russian and of disorgan among hi own troop
formerli after he had given two or three order and utter a
few phrase marshal and adjut had come gallop up with
congratul and happi face announc the trophi taken the
corp of prison bundl of enemi eagl and standard cannon and
store and murat had onli beg leav to loos the cavalri to gather
in the baggag wagon so it had been at lodi marengo arcola jena
austerlitz wagram and so on but now someth strang wa happen
to hi troop
despit new of the captur of the flche napoleon saw that thi wa
not the same not at all the same as what had happen in hi former
battl he saw that what he wa feel wa felt by all the men about
him experienc in the art of war all their face look deject and
thei all shun on anoth eyesonli a de beausset could fail to
grasp the mean of what wa happen
but napoleon with hi long experi of war well knew the mean of
a battl not gain by the attack side in eight hour after all
effort had been expend he knew that it wa a lost battl and that
the least accid might nowwith the fight balanc on such a strain
centerdestroi him and hi armi
when he ran hi mind over the whole of thi strang russian campaign in
which not on battl had been won and in which not a flag or cannon
or armi corp had been captur in two month when he look at the
conceal depress on the face around him and heard report of the
russian still hold their grounda terribl feel like a nightmar
took possess of him and all the unlucki accid that might destroi
him occur to hi mind the russian might fall on hi left wing
might break through hi center he himself might be kill by a strai
cannon ball all thi wa possibl in former battl he had onli
consid the possibl of success but now innumer unlucki
chanc present themselv and he expect them all ye it wa like
a dream in which a man fanci that a ruffian is come to attack him
and rais hi arm to strike that ruffian a terribl blow which he know
should annihil him but then feel that hi arm drop powerless and
limp like a rag and the horror of unavoid destruct seiz him in
hi helpless
the new that the russian were attack the left flank of the french
armi arous that horror in napoleon he sat silent on a campstool
below the knoll with head bow and elbow on hi knee berthier
approach and suggest that thei should ride along the line to
ascertain the posit of affair
what what do you sai ask napoleon ye tell them to bring me my
hors
he mount and rode toward semnovsk
amid the powder smoke slowli dispers over the whole space through
which napoleon rode hors and men were ly in pool of blood singli
or in heap neither napoleon nor ani of hi gener had ever befor
seen such horror or so mani slain in such a small area the roar of
gun that had not ceas for ten hour weari the ear and gave
a peculiar signific to the spectacl as music doe to tableaux
vivant napoleon rode up the high ground at semnovsk and through the
smoke saw rank of men in uniform of a color unfamiliar to him thei
were russian
the russian stood in serri rank behind semnovsk villag and it
knoll and their gun boom incessantli along their line and sent
forth cloud of smoke it wa no longer a battl it wa a continu
slaughter which could be of no avail either to the french or the
russian napoleon stop hi hors and again fell into the reveri
from which berthier had arous him he could not stop what wa go on
befor him and around him and wa suppos to be direct by him and to
depend on him and from it lack of success thi affair for the first
time seem to him unnecessari and horribl
on of the gener rode up to napoleon and ventur to offer to lead
the old guard into action nei and berthier stand near napoleon
exchang look and smile contemptu at thi gener senseless
offer
napoleon bow hi head and remain silent a long time
at eight hundr leagu from franc i will not have my guard
destroi he said and turn hi hors rode back to shevrdino

were not interest in the import of the word spoken but rather in
someth elsein the express of face and tone of voic of those who
were report by long year of militari experi he knew and with
the wisdom of ag understood that it is imposs for on man to
direct hundr of thousand of other struggl with death and he
knew that the result of a battl is decid not by the order of a
command in chief nor the place where the troop ar station nor by
the number of cannon or of slaughter men but by that intang forc
call the spirit of the armi and he watch thi forc and guid it
in as far as that wa in hi power
kutzov gener express wa on of concentr quiet attent
and hi face wore a strain look as if he found it difficult to master
the fatigu of hi old and feebl bodi
at eleven oclock thei brought him new that the flche captur by the
french had been retaken but that princ bagratin wa wound kutzov
groan and swai hi head

soon after the duke departurebefor he could possibl have reach
semnovskhi adjut came back from him and told kutzov that the duke

kutzov made a grimac and sent an order to dokhtrov to take over the
command of the first armi and a request to the dukewhom he said he
could not spare at such an import momentto return to him when
thei brought him new that murat had been taken prison and the staff
offic congratul him kutzov smile
wait a littl gentlemen said he the battl is won and there is
noth extraordinari in the captur of murat still it is better to
wait befor we rejoic
but he sent an adjut to take the new round the armi
when scherbnin came gallop from the left flank with new that the
french had captur the flche and the villag of semnovsk kutzov
guess by the sound of the battl and by scherbnin look that the
new wa bad rose as if to stretch hi leg and take scherbnin
arm led him asid
go my dear fellow he said to ermlov and see whether someth
cant be done
kutzov wa in grki near the center of the russian posit the
attack direct by napoleon against our left flank had been sever
time repuls in the center the french had not got beyond borodin
and on their left flank uvrov cavalri had put the french to flight
toward three oclock the french attack ceas on the face of all
who came from the field of battl and of those who stood around him
kutzov notic an express of extrem tension he wa satisfi with
the dai successa success exceed hi expect but the old
man strength wa fail him sever time hi head drop low as if
it were fall and he doze off dinner wa brought him
adjut gener wolzogen the man who when ride past princ andrew
had said the war should be extend wide and whom bagratin so
detest rode up while kutzov wa at dinner wolzogen had come from
barclai de tolli to report on the progress of affair on the left flank
the sagaci barclai de tolli see crowd of wound men run
back and the disord rear of the armi weigh all the circumst
conclud that the battl wa lost and sent hi favorit offic to the
command in chief with that new
kutzov wa chew a piec of roast chicken with difficulti and glanc
at wolzogen with ey that brighten under their pucker lid
wolzogen nonchalantli stretch hi leg approach kutzov with a
halfcontemptu smile on hi lip scarc touch the peak of hi
cap
he treat hi seren high with a somewhat affect nonchal
intend to show that as a highli train militari man he left it to
russian to make an idol of thi useless old man but that he knew whom
he wa deal with der alt herr as in their own set the german
call kutzov is make himself veri comfort thought wolzogen
and look sever at the dish in front of kutzov he began to
report to the old gentleman the posit of affair on the left flank
as barclai had order him to and as he himself had seen and understood
it
all the point of our posit ar in the enemi hand and we cannot
dislodg them for lack of troop the men ar run awai and it is
imposs to stop them he report
kutzov ceas chew and fix an astonish gaze on wolzogen as
if not understand what wa said to him wolzogen notic the old
gentleman agit said with a smile
i have not consid it right to conceal from your seren high
what i have seen the troop ar in complet disord
you have seen you have seen kutzov shout frown and rise
quickli he went up to wolzogen
how how dare you he shout choke and make a threaten
gestur with hi trembl arm how dare you sir sai that to me you
know noth about it tell gener barclai from me that hi inform
is incorrect and that the real cours of the battl is better known to
me the command in chief than to him
wolzogen wa about to make a rejoind but kutzov interrupt him
the enemi ha been repuls on the left and defeat on the right
flank if you have seen amiss sir do not allow yourself to sai what
you dont know be so good as to ride to gener barclai and inform
him of my firm intent to attack the enemi tomorrow said kutzov
sternli
all were silent and the onli sound audibl wa the heavi breath of
the pant old gener
thei ar repuls everywher for which i thank god and our brave armi
the enemi is beaten and tomorrow we shall drive him from the sacr
soil of russia said kutzov cross himself and he suddenli sob
as hi ey fill with tear
wolzogen shrug hi shoulder and curl hi lip step silent
asid marvel at the old gentleman conceit stupid
ah here he is my hero said kutzov to a portli handsom
darkhair gener who wa just ascend the knoll
thi wa ravski who had spent the whole dai at the most import part
of the field of borodin
ravski report that the troop were firmli hold their ground and
that the french no longer ventur to attack
after hear him kutzov said in french
then you do not think like some other that we must retreat
on the contrari your high in indecis action it is alwai
the most stubborn who remain victor repli ravski and in my
opinion
kaysrov kutzov call to hi adjut sit down and write out
the order of the dai for tomorrow and you he continu address
anoth ride along the line and announc that tomorrow we attack
while kutzov wa talk to ravski and dictat the order of the dai
wolzogen return from barclai and said that gener barclai wish to
have written confirm of the order the field marshal had given
kutzov without look at wolzogen gave direct for the order to
be written out which the former command in chief to avoid person
respons veri judici wish to receiv
and by mean of that mysteri indefin bond which maintain
throughout an armi on and the same temper known as the spirit of
the armi and which constitut the sinew of war kutzov word hi
order for a battl next dai immedi becam known from on end of
the armi to the other
it wa far from be the same word or the same order that reach the
farthest link of that chain the tale pass from mouth to mouth at
differ end of the armi did not even resembl what kutzov had said
but the sens of hi word spread everywher becaus what he said wa
not the outcom of cun calcul but of a feel that lai in
the command in chief soul as in that of everi russian
and on learn that tomorrow thei were to attack the enemi and hear
from the highest quarter a confirm of what thei want to believ
the exhaust waver men felt comfort and inspirit

togeth with the heavi of hi head and the new that some twenti
gener he knew person had been kill or wound and the
conscious of the impot of hi onc mighti arm produc an
unexpect impress on napoleon who usual like to look at the
kill and wound therebi he consid test hi strength of
mind thi dai the horribl appear of the battlefield overcam
that strength of mind which he thought constitut hi merit and hi
great he rode hurriedli from the battlefield and return to the
shevrdino knoll where he sat on hi campstool hi sallow face
swollen and heavi hi ey dim hi nose red and hi voic hoars
involuntarili listen with downcast ey to the sound of fire
with pain deject he await the end of thi action in which he
regard himself as a particip and which he wa unabl to arrest
a person human feel for a brief moment got the better of the
artifici phantasm of life he had serv so long he felt in hi own
person the suffer and death he had wit on the battlefield
the heavi of hi head and chest remind him of the possibl
of suffer and death for himself at that moment he did not desir
moscow or victori or glori what need had he for ani more glori the
on thing he wish for wa rest tranquil and freedom but when he
had been on the semnovsk height the artilleri command had propos
to him to bring sever batteri of artilleri up to those height to
strengthen the fire on the russian troop crowd in front of knyazkvo
napoleon had assent and had given order that new should be brought
to him of the effect those batteri produc
an adjut came now to inform him that the fire of two hundr gun
had been concentr on the russian as he had order but that thei
still held their ground
our fire is mow them down by row but still thei hold on said the
adjut
thei want more said napoleon in a hoars voic
sire ask the adjut who had not heard the remark
thei want more croak napoleon frown let them have it
even befor he gave that order the thing he did not desir and for
which he gave the order onli becaus he thought it wa expect of him
wa be done and he fell back into that artifici realm of imaginari
great and againa a hors walk a treadmil think it is do
someth for itselfh submiss fulfil the cruel sad gloomi
and inhuman role predestin for him
and not for that dai and hour alon were the mind and conscienc
darken of thi man on whom the respons for what wa happen
lai more than on all the other who took part in it never to the end
of hi life could he understand good beauti or truth or the
signific of hi action which were too contrari to good and
truth too remot from everyth human for him ever to be abl to
grasp their mean he could not disavow hi action belaud as thei
were by half the world and so he had to repudi truth good and
all human
not onli on that dai as he rode over the battlefield strewn with men
kill and maim by hi will as he believ did he reckon as he
look at them how mani russian there were for each frenchman and
deceiv himself find reason for rejoic in the calcul that
there were five russian for everi frenchman not on that dai alon
did he write in a letter to pari that the battl field wa superb
becaus fifti thousand corps lai there but even on the island of st
helena in the peac solitud where he said he intend to devot hi
leisur to an account of the great deed he had done he wrote
the russian war should have been the most popular war of modern time
it wa a war of good sens for real interest for the tranquil and
secur of all it wa pure pacif and conserv
it wa a war for a great caus the end of uncertainti and the
begin of secur a new horizon and new labor were open out
full of wellb and prosper for all the european system wa
alreadi found all that remain wa to organ it
satisfi on these great point and with tranquil everywher i
too should have had my congress and my holi allianc those idea were
stolen from me in that reunion of great sovereign we should have
discuss our interest like on famili and have render account to

europ would in thi wai soon have been in fact but on peopl and
anyon who travel anywher would have found himself alwai in the
common fatherland i should have demand the freedom of all navig
river for everybodi that the sea should be common to all and that
the great stand armi should be reduc henceforth to mere guard

on return to franc to the bosom of the great strong magnific

with the empress and dure the royal apprenticeship of my son to
leisur visit with our own hors and like a true countri coupl
everi corner of the empir receiv complaint redress wrong
and scatter public build and benefact on all side and
everywher
napoleon predestin by provid for the gloomi role of execution
of the peopl assur himself that the aim of hi action had been the
peopl welfar and that he could control the fate of million and by
the employ of power confer benefact
of four hundr thousand who cross the vistula he wrote further
of the russian war half were austrian prussian saxon pole

neapolitan the imperi armi strictli speak wa on third
compos of dutch belgian men from the border of the rhine
piedmontes swiss geneves tuscan roman inhabit of the
thirtysecond militari divis of bremen of hamburg and so on it
includ scarc a hundr and forti thousand who spoke french the
russian expedit actual cost franc less than fifti thousand men
the russian armi in it retreat from vlna to moscow lost in the variou
battl four time more men than the french armi the burn of moscow
cost the live of a hundr thousand russian who di of cold and want
in the wood final in it march from moscow to the oder the russian
armi also suffer from the sever of the season so that by the time
it reach vlna it number onli fifti thousand and at klisch less
than eighteen thousand
he imagin that the war with russia came about by hi will and the
horror that occur did not stagger hi soul he boldli took the
whole respons for what happen and hi darken mind found
justif in the belief that among the hundr of thousand who
perish there were fewer frenchmen than hessian and bavarian
chapter xxxix
sever ten of thousand of the slain lai in divers postur and
variou uniform on the field and meadow belong to the davdov
famili and to the crown serfsthos field and meadow where for
hundr of year the peasant of borodin grki shevrdino and
semnovsk had reap their harvest and pastur their cattl at the
dress station the grass and earth were soak with blood for a space
of some three acr around crowd of men of variou arm wound and
unwound with frighten face drag themselv back to mozhysk
from the on armi and back to valevo from the other other crowd
exhaust and hungri went forward led by their offic other held
their ground and continu to fire
over the whole field previous so gaili beauti with the glitter of
bayonet and cloudlet of smoke in the morn sun there now spread a
mist of damp and smoke and a strang acid smell of saltpet and blood
cloud gather and drop of rain began to fall on the dead and wound
on the frighten exhaust and hesit men as if to sai enough
men enough ceas bethink yourselv what ar you do
to the men of both side alik worn out by want of food and rest
it began equal to appear doubt whether thei should continu to
slaughter on anoth all the face express hesit and the
question aros in everi soul for what for whom must i kill and be
kill you mai go and kill whom you pleas but i dont want to do
so ani more by even thi thought had ripen in everi soul at ani
moment these men might have been seiz with horror at what thei were
do and might have thrown up everyth and run awai anywher
but though toward the end of the battl the men felt all the horror of
what thei were do though thei would have been glad to leav off
some incomprehens mysteri power continu to control them and
thei still brought up the charg load aim and appli the match
though onli on artilleryman surviv out of everi three and though
thei stumbl and pant with fatigu perspir and stain with blood
and powder the cannon ball flew just as swiftli and cruelli from both
side crush human bodi and that terribl work which wa not done
by the will of a man but at the will of him who govern men and world
continu
anyon look at the disorgan rear of the russian armi would have
said that if onli the french made on more slight effort it would
disappear and anyon look at the rear of the french armi would have
said that the russian need onli make on more slight effort and the
french would be destroi but neither the french nor the russian made
that effort and the flame of battl burn slowli out
the russian did not make that effort becaus thei were not attack
the french at the begin of the battl thei stood block the
wai to moscow and thei still did so at the end of the battl as at the
begin but even had the aim of the russian been to drive the french
from their posit thei could not have made thi last effort for all
the russian troop had been broken up there wa no part of the russian
armi that had not suffer in the battl and though still hold their
posit thei had lost on half of their armi
the french with the memori of all their former victori dure
fifteen year with the assur of napoleon invinc with the
conscious that thei had captur part of the battlefield and had
lost onli a quarter of their men and still had their guard intact
twenti thousand strong might easili have made that effort the french
who had attack the russian armi in order to drive it from it posit
ought to have made that effort for as long as the russian continu to
block the road to moscow as befor the aim of the french had not been
attain and all their effort and loss were in vain but the french
did not make that effort some historian sai that napoleon need onli
have us hi old guard who were intact and the battl would have
been won to speak of what would have happen had napoleon sent hi
guard is like talk of what would happen if autumn becam spring it
could not be napoleon did not give hi guard not becaus he did not
want to but becaus it could not be done all the gener offic
and soldier of the french armi knew it could not be done becaus the
flag spirit of the troop would not permit it
it wa not napoleon alon who had experienc that nightmar feel
of the mighti arm be stricken powerless but all the gener and
soldier of hi armi whether thei had taken part in the battl or not
after all their experi of previou battleswhen after on tenth of
such effort the enemi had fledexperienc a similar feel of terror
befor an enemi who after lose half hi men stood as threateningli
at the end as at the begin of the battl the moral forc of the
attack french armi wa exhaust not that sort of victori which is
defin by the captur of piec of materi fasten to stick call
standard and of the ground on which the troop had stood and were
stand but a moral victori that convinc the enemi of the moral
superior of hi oppon and of hi own impot wa gain by the
russian at borodin the french invad like an infuri anim
that ha in it onslaught receiv a mortal wound felt that thei were
perish but could not stop ani more than the russian armi weaker
by on half could help swerv by impetu gain the french armi wa
still abl to roll forward to moscow but there without further effort
on the part of the russian it had to perish bleed from the mortal
wound it had receiv at borodin the direct consequ of the battl
of borodin wa napoleon senseless flight from moscow hi retreat
along the old smolnsk road the destruct of the invad armi of
five hundr thousand men and the downfal of napoleon franc on
which at borodin for the first time the hand of an oppon of stronger
spirit had been laid

absolut continu of motion is not comprehens to the human mind
law of motion of ani kind becom comprehens to man onli when he
examin arbitrarili select element of that motion but at the
same time a larg proport of human error come from the arbitrari
divis of continu motion into discontinu element there is a
wellknown socal sophism of the ancient consist in thi that
achil could never catch up with a tortois he wa follow in spite
of the fact that he travel ten time as fast as the tortois by
the time achil ha cover the distanc that separ him from the
tortois the tortois ha cover on tenth of that distanc ahead
of him when achil ha cover that tenth the tortois ha cover
anoth on hundredth and so on forev thi problem seem to
the ancient insolubl the absurd answer that achil could never
overtak the tortois result from thi that motion wa arbitrarili
divid into discontinu element wherea the motion both of achil
and of the tortois wa continu
by adopt smaller and smaller element of motion we onli approach a
solut of the problem but never reach it onli when we have admit
the concept of the infinit small and the result geometr
progress with a common ratio of on tenth and have found the sum of
thi progress to infin do we reach a solut of the problem
a modern branch of mathemat have achiev the art of deal with
the infinit small can now yield solut in other more complex
problem of motion which us to appear insolubl
thi modern branch of mathemat unknown to the ancient when deal
with problem of motion admit the concept of the infinit small
and so conform to the chief condit of motion absolut continu
and therebi correct the inevit error which the human mind cannot
avoid when it deal with separ element of motion instead of
examin continu motion
in seek the law of histor movement just the same thing happen
the movement of human aris as it doe from innumer arbitrari
human will is continu
to understand the law of thi continu movement is the aim of
histori but to arriv at these law result from the sum of all
those human will man mind postul arbitrari and disconnect
unit the first method of histori is to take an arbitrarili select
seri of continu event and examin it apart from other though
there is and can be no begin to ani event for on event alwai
flow uninterruptedli from anoth
the second method is to consid the action of some on mana king or a
commandera equival to the sum of mani individu will wherea the
sum of individu will is never express by the activ of a singl
histor personag
histor scienc in it endeavor to draw nearer to truth continu
take smaller and smaller unit for examin but howev small the
unit it take we feel that to take ani unit disconnect from other
or to assum a begin of ani phenomenon or to sai that the will of
mani men is express by the action of ani on histor personag is
in itself fals
it need no critic exert to reduc utterli to dust ani deduct
drawn from histori it is mere necessari to select some larger or
smaller unit as the subject of observationa critic ha everi
right to do see that whatev unit histori observ must alwai be
arbitrarili select
onli by take infinitesim small unit for observ the
differenti of histori that is the individu tendenc of men and
attain to the art of integr them that is find the sum of
these infinitesim can we hope to arriv at the law of histori
the first fifteen year of the nineteenth centuri in europ present an
extraordinari movement of million of peopl men leav their customari
pursuit hasten from on side of europ to the other plunder and
slaughter on anoth triumph and ar plung in despair and for some
year the whole cours of life is alter and present an intens
movement which first increas and then slacken what wa the caus of
thi movement by what law wa it govern ask the mind of man
the historian repli to thi question lai befor us the sai and
do of a few dozen men in a build in the citi of pari call
these sai and do the revolut then thei give a detail
biographi of napoleon and of certain peopl favor or hostil to him
tell of the influenc some of these peopl had on other and sai that
is why thi movement took place and those ar it law
but the mind of man not onli refus to believ thi explan but
plainli sai that thi method of explan is fallaci becaus in
it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the caus of a stronger the sum of
human will produc the revolut and napoleon and onli the sum of
those will first toler and then destroi them
but everi time there have been conquest there have been conqueror
everi time there ha been a revolut in ani state there have been
great men sai histori and inde human reason repli everi time
conqueror appear there have been war but thi doe not prove that the
conqueror caus the war and that it is possibl to find the law of
a war in the person activ of a singl man whenev i look at my
watch and it hand point to ten i hear the bell of the neighbor
church but becaus the bell begin to ring when the hand of the clock
reach ten i have no right to assum that the movement of the bell is
caus by the posit of the hand of the watch
whenev i see the movement of a locomot i hear the whistl and see
the valv open and wheel turn but i have no right to conclud
that the whistl and the turn of wheel ar the caus of the
movement of the engin
the peasant sai that a cold wind blow in late spring becaus the oak
ar bud and realli everi spring cold wind do blow when the oak
is bud but though i do not know what caus the cold wind to blow
when the oak bud unfold i cannot agre with the peasant that the
unfold of the oak bud is the caus of the cold wind for the
forc of the wind is beyond the influenc of the bud i see onli a
coincid of occurr such as happen with all the phenomena of
life and i see that howev much and howev carefulli i observ the
hand of the watch and the valv and wheel of the engin and the
oak i shall not discov the caus of the bell ring the engin
move or of the wind of spring to that i must entir chang my
point of view and studi the law of the movement of steam of the
bell and of the wind histori must do the same and attempt in thi
direct have alreadi been made
to studi the law of histori we must complet chang the subject of
our observ must leav asid king minist and gener and
studi the common infinitesim small element by which the mass ar
move no on can sai in how far it is possibl for man to advanc
in thi wai toward an understand of the law of histori but it is
evid that onli along that path doe the possibl of discov
the law of histori lie and that as yet not a millionth part as much
mental effort ha been appli in thi direct by historian as ha
been devot to describ the action of variou king command
and minist and propound the historian own reflect concern
these action
chapter ii
the forc of a dozen european nation burst into russia the russian
armi and peopl avoid a collis till smolnsk wa reach and again
from smolnsk to borodin the french armi push on to moscow it
goal it impetu ever increas as it near it aim just as the
veloc of a fall bodi increas as it approach the earth behind
it were seven hundr mile of hungerstricken hostil countri ahead
were a few dozen mile separ it from it goal everi soldier in
napoleon armi felt thi and the invas move on by it own momentum
the more the russian armi retreat the more fierc a spirit of hatr
of the enemi flare up and while it retreat the armi increas and
consolid at borodin a collis took place neither armi wa
broken up but the russian armi retreat immedi after the
collis as inevit as a ball recoil after collid with anoth
have a greater momentum and with equal inevit the ball
of invas that had advanc with such momentum roll on for some
distanc though the collis had depriv it of all it forc
the russian retreat eighti milesto beyond moscowand the french
reach moscow and there came to a standstil for five week after that
there wa not a singl battl the french did not move as a bleed
mortal wound anim lick it wound thei remain inert in moscow
for five week and then suddenli with no fresh reason fled back
thei made a dash for the kalga road and after a victoryfor at
mloyaroslvet the field of conflict again remain their without
undertak a singl seriou battl thei fled still more rapidli back
to smolnsk beyond smolnsk beyond the berzina beyond vlna and
farther still
on the even of the twentysixth of august kutzov and the whole
russian armi were convinc that the battl of borodin wa a victori
kutzov report so to the emperor he gave order to prepar for a
fresh conflict to finish the enemi and did thi not to deceiv anyon
but becaus he knew that the enemi wa beaten as everyon who had taken
part in the battl knew it
but all that even and next dai report came in on after anoth
of unheardof loss of the loss of half the armi and a fresh battl
prove physic imposs
it wa imposs to give battl befor inform had been collect
the wound gather in the suppli of ammunit replenish the
slain reckon up new offic appoint to replac those who had been
kill and befor the men had had food and sleep and meanwhil the
veri next morn after the battl the french armi advanc of itself
upon the russian carri forward by the forc of it own momentum now
seemingli increas in invers proport to the squar of the distanc
from it aim kutzov wish wa to attack next dai and the whole
armi desir to do so but to make an attack the wish to do so is not
suffici there must also be a possibl of do it and that
possibl did not exist it wa imposs not to retreat a dai
march and then in the same wai it wa imposs not to retreat anoth
and a third dai march and at last on the first of septemb when
the armi drew near moscowdespit the strength of the feel that had
arisen in all ranksth forc of circumst compel it to retir
beyond moscow and the troop retir on more last dai march and
abandon moscow to the enemi
for peopl accustom to think that plan of campaign and battl ar
made by generalsa anyon of us sit over a map in hi studi mai
imagin how he would have arrang thing in thi or that battleth
question present themselv why did kutzov dure the retreat not do
thi or that why did he not take up a posit befor reach fil
why did he not retir at onc by the kalga road abandon moscow and
so on peopl accustom to think in that wai forget or do not know
the inevit condit which alwai limit the activ of ani
command in chief the activ of a command in chief doe not at all
resembl the activ we imagin to ourselv when we sit at eas in
our studi examin some campaign on the map with a certain number of
troop on thi and that side in a certain known local and begin our
plan from some given moment a command in chief is never deal with
the begin of ani eventth posit from which we alwai contempl
it the command in chief is alwai in the midst of a seri of
shift event and so he never can at ani moment consid the whole
import of an event that is occur moment by moment the event is
impercept shape itself and at everi moment of thi continu
uninterrupt shape of event the command in chief is in the
midst of a most complex plai of intrigu worri conting
author project counsel threat and decept and is
continu oblig to repli to innumer question address to him
which constantli conflict with on anoth
learn militari author quit serious tell us that kutzov should
have move hi armi to the kalga road long befor reach fil and
that somebodi actual submit such a propos to him but a command
in chief especi at a difficult moment ha alwai befor him not
on propos but dozen simultan and all these propos base
on strateg and tactic contradict each other
a command in chief busi it would seem is simpli to choos on
of these project but even that he cannot do event and time do not
wait for instanc on the twentyeighth it is suggest to him to
cross to the kalga road but just then an adjut gallop up from
milordovich ask whether he is to engag the french or retir an
order must be given him at onc that instant and the order to retreat
carri us past the turn to the kalga road and after the adjut
come the commissari gener ask where the store ar to be taken
and the chief of the hospit ask where the wound ar to go and a
courier from petersburg bring a letter from the sovereign which doe
not admit of the possibl of abandon moscow and the command in
chief rival the man who is undermin him and there ar alwai
not mere on but sever such present a new project diametr
oppos to that of turn to the kalga road and the command in
chief himself need sleep and refresh to maintain hi energi and
a respect gener who ha been overlook in the distribut of
reward come to complain and the inhabit of the district prai to
be defend and an offic sent to inspect the local come in and
give a report quit contrari to what wa said by the offic
previous sent and a spy a prison and a gener who ha been
on reconnaiss all describ the posit of the enemi armi
differ peopl accustom to misunderstand or to forget these
inevit condit of a command in chief action describ to
us for instanc the posit of the armi at fil and assum that the
command in chief could on the first of septemb quit freeli decid
whether to abandon moscow or defend it wherea with the russian armi
less than four mile from moscow no such question exist when had
that question been settl at drissa and at smolnsk and most
palpabl of all on the twentyfourth of august at shevrdino and on
the twentysixth at borodin and each dai and hour and minut of the
retreat from borodin to fil
chapter iii
when ermlov have been sent by kutzov to inspect the posit told
the field marshal that it wa imposs to fight there befor moscow
and that thei must retreat kutzov look at him in silenc
give me your hand said he and turn it over so as to feel the
puls ad you ar not well my dear fellow think what you ar
sai
kutzov could not yet admit the possibl of retreat beyond moscow
without a battl
on the poklnni hill four mile from the dorogomlov gate of moscow
kutzov got out of hi carriag and sat down on a bench by the roadsid
a great crowd of gener gather round him and count rostopchn who
had come out from moscow join them thi brilliant compani separ
into sever group who all discuss the advantag and disadvantag
of the posit the state of the armi the plan suggest the
situat of moscow and militari question gener though thei had
not been summon for the purpos and though it wa not so call thei
all felt that thi wa realli a council of war the convers all
dealt with public question if anyon gave or ask for person
new it wa done in a whisper and thei immedi revert to gener
matter no joke or laughter or smile even were seen among all
these men thei evid all made an effort to hold themselv at the
height the situat demand and all these group while talk
among themselv tri to keep near the command in chief whose
bench form the center of the gather and to speak so that he might
overhear them the command in chief listen to what wa be said
and sometim ask them to repeat their remark but did not himself
take part in the convers or express ani opinion after hear
what wa be said by on or other of these group he gener turn
awai with an air of disappoint as though thei were not speak of
anyth he wish to hear some discuss the posit that had been
chosen critic not the posit itself so much as the mental
capac of those who had chosen it other argu that a mistak had
been made earlier and that a battl should have been fought two dai
befor other again spoke of the battl of salamanca which wa
describ by crosart a newli arriv frenchman in a spanish uniform
thi frenchman and on of the german princ serv with the russian
armi were discuss the sieg of saragossa and consid the
possibl of defend moscow in a similar manner count rostopchn
wa tell a fourth group that he wa prepar to die with the citi
train band under the wall of the capit but that he still could not
help regret have been left in ignor of what wa happen and
that had he known it sooner thing would have been differ a
fifth group displai the profund of their strateg percept
discuss the direct the troop would now have to take a sixth group
wa talk absolut nonsens kutzov express grew more and more
preoccupi and gloomi from all thi talk he saw onli on thing that
to defend moscow wa a physic imposs in the full mean of
those word that is to sai so utterli imposs that if ani senseless
command were to give order to fight confus would result but the
battl would still not take place it would not take place becaus the
command not mere all recogn the posit to be imposs but
in their convers were onli discuss what would happen after it
inevit abandon how could the command lead their troop to
a field of battl thei consid imposs to hold the lowergrad
offic and even the soldier who too reason also consid the
posit imposs and therefor could not go to fight fulli convinc
as thei were of defeat if bennigsen insist on the posit be
defend and other still discuss it the question wa no longer
import in itself but onli as a pretext for disput and intrigu
thi kutzov knew well
bennigsen who had chosen the posit warmli displai hi russian
patriot kutzov could not listen to thi without winc by
insist that moscow must be defend hi aim wa as clear as daylight
to kutzov if the defens fail to throw the blame on kutzov who had
brought the armi as far as the sparrow hill without give battl if
it succeed to claim the success as hi own or if battl were not
given to clear himself of the crime of abandon moscow but thi
intrigu did not now occupi the old man mind on terribl question
absorb him and to that question he heard no repli from anyon the
question for him now wa have i realli allow napoleon to reach
moscow and when did i do so when wa it decid can it have been
yesterdai when i order pltov to retreat or wa it the even
befor when i had a nap and told bennigsen to issu order or wa it
earlier still when when wa thi terribl affair decid moscow
must be abandon the armi must retreat and the order to do so must
be given to give that terribl order seem to him equival to
resign the command of the armi and not onli did he love power to
which he wa accustom the honour award to princ prozorvski
under whom he had serv in turkei gall him but he wa convinc
that he wa destin to save russia and that that wa why against
the emperor wish and by the will of the peopl he had been chosen
command in chief he wa convinc that he alon could maintain
command of the armi in these difficult circumst and that in all
the world he alon could encount the invinc napoleon without fear
and he wa horrifi at the thought of the order he had to issu but
someth had to be decid and these convers around him which
were assum too free a charact must be stop
he call the most import gener to him
my head be it good or bad must depend on itself said he rise
from the bench and he rode to fil where hi carriag were wait
chapter iv
the council of war began to assembl at two in the afternoon in the
better and roomier part of andrew savostynov hut the men women and
children of the larg peasant famili crowd into the back room across
the passag onli malsha andrew sixyearold granddaught whom
hi seren high had pet and to whom he had given a lump of sugar

larger room malsha look down from the oven with shy delight at the
face uniform and decor of the gener who on after anoth
came into the room and sat down on the broad bench in the corner
under the icon granddad himself as malsha in her own mind call
kutzov sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven he sat sunk deep
in a fold armchair and continu clear hi throat and pull at
the collar of hi coat which though it wa unbutton still seem
to pinch hi neck those who enter went up on by on to the field

attack the french right wing
gentlemen said kutzov i cannot approv of the count plan move
troop in close proxim to an enemi is alwai danger and militari
histori support that view for instanc kutzov seem to reflect
search for an exampl then with a clear nave look at bennigsen he
ad oh ye take the battl of friedland which i think the count

after the battl of borodin the abandon and burn of moscow wa
as inevit as the retreat of the armi beyond moscow without fight

particip of count rostopchn and hi broadsheet the peopl
await the enemi unconcernedli did not riot or becom excit or tear
anyon to piec but face it fate feel within it the strength to
find what it should do at that most difficult moment and as soon as the
enemi drew near the wealthi class went awai abandon their properti
while the poorer remain and burn and destroi what wa left
the conscious that thi would be so and would alwai be so wa and
is present in the heart of everi russian and a conscious of thi
and a forebod that moscow would be taken wa present in russian
moscow societi in 1812 those who had quit moscow alreadi in juli
and at the begin of august show that thei expect thi those who
went awai take what thei could and abandon their hous and half
their belong did so from the latent patriot which express
itself not by phrase or by give on children to save the fatherland

remain intact and that dure napoleon occup the inhabit
had spent their time pleasantli in the compani of the charm frenchmen
whom the russian and especi the russian ladi then like so
much
thei went awai becaus for russian there could be no question as to
whether thing would go well or ill under french rule in moscow it wa
out of the question to be under french rule it would be the worst thing
that could happen thei went awai even befor the battl of borodin and
still more rapidli after it despit rostopchn call to defend moscow
or the announc of hi intent to take the wonderwork icon of
the iberian mother of god and go to fight or of the balloon that were

by cun she would have spoil her case by acknowledg herself

never been her husband wife and that she had been sacrif
but the law religion said the princ alreadi yield
the law religion what have thei been invent for if thei cant
arrang that said hlne
the princ wa surpris that so simpl an idea had not occur to him
and he appli for advic to the holi brethren of the societi of jesu
with whom he wa on intim term
a few dai later at on of those enchant fete which hlne gave at
her countri hous on the stone island the charm monsieur de jobert
a man no longer young with snow white hair and brilliant black ey
a jesuit robe court wa present to her and in the garden by the
light of the illumin and to the sound of music talk to her for a
long time of the love of god of christ of the sacr heart and of the
consol the on true cathol religion afford in thi world and
the next hlne wa touch and more than onc tear rose to her ey
and to those of monsieur de jobert and their voic trembl a danc
for which her partner came to seek her put an end to her discours with
her futur directeur de conscienc but the next even monsieur de
jobert came to see hlne when she wa alon and after that often came
again
lai member of the societi of jesu
on dai he took the countess to a roman cathol church where she knelt
down befor the altar to which she wa led the enchant middleag
frenchman laid hi hand on her head and as she herself afterward
describ it she felt someth like a fresh breez waft into her
soul it wa explain to her that thi wa la grce
after that a longfrock abb wa brought to her she confess to
him and he absolv her from her sin next dai she receiv a box
contain the sacr host which wa left at her hous for her to
partak of a few dai later hlne learn with pleasur that she had
now been admit to the true cathol church and that in a few dai the
pope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain document
all that wa done around her and to her at thi time all the attent
devot to her by so mani clever men and express in such pleasant
refin wai and the state of dovelik puriti she wa now in she wore
onli white dress and white ribbon all that time gave her pleasur
but her pleasur did not caus her for a moment to forget her aim and
as it alwai happen in contest of cun that a stupid person get
the better of clever on hlnehav realiz that the main object
of all these word and all thi troubl wa after convert her to
catholic to obtain monei from her for jesuit institut as to
which she receiv indicationsbefor part with her monei insist
that the variou oper necessari to free her from her husband
should be perform in her view the aim of everi religion wa mere
to preserv certain proprieti while afford satisfact to
human desir and with thi aim in on of her talk with her father
confessor she insist on an answer to the question in how far wa she
bound by her marriag
thei were sit in the twilight by a window in the draw room
the scent of flower came in at the window hlne wa wear a white
dress transpar over her shoulder and bosom the abb a wellf
man with a plump cleanshaven chin a pleasant firm mouth and white
hand meekli fold on hi knee sat close to hlne and with a
subtl smile on hi lip and a peac look of delight at her beauti
occasion glanc at her face as he explain hi opinion on the
subject hlne with an uneasi smile look at hi curli hair and hi
plump cleanshaven blackish cheek and everi moment expect the
convers to take a fresh turn but the abb though he evid
enjoi the beauti of hi companion wa absorb in hi masteri of the
matter
the cours of the father confessor argument ran as follow ignor
of the import of what you were undertak you made a vow of conjug
fidel to a man who on hi part by enter the marri state without
faith in the religi signific of marriag commit an act of
sacrileg that marriag lack the dual signific it should have
had yet in spite of thi your vow wa bind you swerv from it
what did you commit by so act a venial or a mortal sin a venial
sin for you act without evil intent if now you marri again
with the object of bear children your sin might be forgiven but the
question is again a twofold on firstli
but suddenli hlne who wa get bore said with on of her
bewitch smile but i think that have espous the true religion i
cannot be bound by what a fals religion laid upon me
the director of her conscienc wa astound at have the case
present to him thu with the simplic of columbu egg he wa
delight at the unexpect rapid of hi pupil progress but could
not abandon the edific of argument he had labori construct
let us understand on anoth countess said he with a smile and
began refut hi spiritu daughter argument
chapter vii
hlne understood that the question wa veri simpl and easi from
the ecclesiast point of view and that her director were make
difficulti onli becaus thei were apprehens as to how the matter
would be regard by the secular author
so she decid that it wa necessari to prepar the opinion of societi
she provok the jealousi of the elderli magnat and told him what she
had told her other suitor that is she put the matter so that the onli
wai for him to obtain a right over her wa to marri her the elderli
magnat wa at first as much taken aback by thi suggest of marriag
with a woman whose husband wa aliv as the younger man had been but
hlne imperturb convict that it wa as simpl and natur as
marri a maiden had it effect on him too had hlne herself shown
the least sign of hesit shame or secreci her caus would
certainli have been lost but not onli did she show no sign of secreci
or shame on the contrari with goodnatur navet she told her
intim friend and these were all petersburg that both the princ
and the magnat had propos to her and that she love both and wa
afraid of griev either
a rumor immedi spread in petersburg not that hlne want to
be divorc from her husband had such a report spread mani would have
oppos so illeg an intent but simpli that the unfortun and
interest hlne wa in doubt which of the two men she should marri
the question wa no longer whether thi wa possibl but onli which wa
the better match and how the matter would be regard at court there
were it is true some rigid individu unabl to rise to the height of
such a question who saw in the project a desecr of the sacrament
of marriag but there were not mani such and thei remain silent
while the major were interest in hlne good fortun and in the
question which match would be the more advantag whether it wa
right or wrong to remarri while on had a husband live thei did not
discuss for that question had evid been settl by peopl wiser
than you or me as thei said and to doubt the correct of that
decis would be to risk expos on stupid and incapac to
live in societi
onli mrya dmtrievna akhrosmova who had come to petersburg that
summer to see on of her son allow herself plainli to express
an opinion contrari to the gener on meet hlne at a ball she
stop her in the middl of the room and amid gener silenc said

though peopl were afraid of mrya dmtrievna she wa regard in
petersburg as a buffoon and so of what she had said thei onli notic
and repeat in a whisper the on coars word she had us suppos
the whole sting of her remark to lie in that word

batteri those who had given him food and those who had prai befor
the icon thei those strang men he had not previous known stood out
clearli and sharpli from everyon els
to be a soldier just a soldier thought pierr as he fell asleep
to enter commun life complet to be imbu by what make them what
thei ar but how to cast off all the superflu devilish burden of my
outer man there wa a time when i could have done it i could have run
awai from my father as i want to or i might have been sent to serv
as a soldier after the duel with dlokhov and the memori of the dinner
at the english club when he had challeng dlokhov flash through
pierr mind and then he rememb hi benefactor at torzhk and now
a pictur of a solemn meet of the lodg present itself to hi mind
it wa take place at the english club and someon near and dear to him
sat at the end of the tabl ye that is he it is my benefactor
but he di thought pierr ye he di and i did not know he wa
aliv how sorri i am that he di and how glad i am that he is aliv
again on on side of the tabl sat anatol dlokhov nesvtski
densov and other like them in hi dream the categori to which these
men belong wa as clearli defin in hi mind as the categori of
those he term thei and he heard those peopl anatol and dlokhov
shout and sing loudli yet through their shout the voic of hi
benefactor wa heard speak all the time and the sound of hi word
wa as weighti and uninterrupt as the boom on the battlefield but
pleasant and comfort pierr did not understand what hi benefactor
wa sai but he knew the categori of thought were also quit
distinct in hi dream that he wa talk of good and the
possibl of be what thei were and thei with their simpl kind
firm face surround hi benefactor on all side but though thei were
kindli thei did not look at pierr and did not know him wish to
speak and to attract their attent he got up but at that moment hi
leg grew cold and bare
he felt asham and with on arm cover hi leg from which hi cloak
had in fact slip for a moment as he wa rearrang hi cloak pierr
open hi ey and saw the same penthous roof post and yard but
now thei were all bluish lit up and glitter with frost or dew
it is dawn thought pierr but that not what i want i want to
hear and understand my benefactor word again he cover himself up
with hi cloak but now neither the lodg nor hi benefactor wa there
there were onli thought clearli express in word thought that
someon wa utter or that he himself wa formul
afterward when he recal those thought pierr wa convinc that
someon outsid himself had spoken them though the impress of that
dai had evok them he had never it seem to him been abl to think
and express hi thought like that when awak
to endur war is the most difficult subordin of man freedom to
the law of god the voic had said simplic is submiss to the
will of god you cannot escap from him and thei ar simpl thei do
not talk but act the spoken word is silver but the unspoken is golden
man can be master of noth while he fear death but he who doe not
fear it possess all if there were no suffer man would not know
hi limit would not know himself the hardest thing pierr went
on think or hear in hi dream is to be abl in your soul to
unit the mean of all to unit all he ask himself no not
to unit thought cannot be unit but to har all these thought
togeth is what we need ye on must har them must har
them he repeat to himself with inward raptur feel that these
word and thei alon express what he want to sai and solv the
question that torment him
ye on must har it is time to har
time to har time to har your excel your excel
some voic wa repeat we must har it is time to har

chapter xxiv
on the even of the first of septemb after hi interview with
kutzov count rostopchn had return to moscow mortifi and offend
becaus he had not been invit to attend the council of war and
becaus kutzov had paid no attent to hi offer to take part in the
defens of the citi amaz also at the novel outlook reveal to him
at the camp which treat the tranquil of the capit and it
patriot fervor as not mere secondari but quit irrelev and
unimport matter distress offend and surpris by all thi
rostopchn had return to moscow after supper he lai down on a sofa
without undress and wa awaken soon after midnight by a courier
bring him a letter from kutzov thi letter request the count to
send polic offic to guid the troop through the town as the armi
wa retreat to the ryazn road beyond moscow thi wa not new to
rostopchn he had known that moscow would be abandon not mere sinc
hi interview the previou dai with kutzov on the poklnni hill but
ever sinc the battl of borodin for all the gener who came to
moscow after that battl had said unanim that it wa imposs to
fight anoth battl and sinc then the govern properti had been
remov everi night and half the inhabit had left the citi
with rostopchn own permiss yet all the same thi inform
astonish and irrit the count come as it did in the form of a
simpl note with an order from kutzov and receiv at night break
in on hi beauti sleep
when later on in hi memoir count rostopchn explain hi action at
thi time he repeatedli sai that he wa then actuat by two import
consider to maintain tranquil in moscow and expedit the
departur of the inhabit if on accept thi twofold aim all
rostopchn action appear irreproach why were the holi relic
the arm ammunit gunpowd and store of corn not remov why
were thousand of inhabit deceiv into believ that moscow would
not be given upand therebi ruin to preserv the tranquil
of the citi explain count rostopchn why were bundl of useless
paper from the govern offic and leppich balloon and other
articl remov to leav the town empti explain count rostopchn
on need onli admit that public tranquil is in danger and ani action
find a justif
all the horror of the reign of terror were base onli on solicitud for
public tranquil
on what then wa count rostopchn fear for the tranquil of
moscow base in 1812 what reason wa there for assum ani probabl
of an upris in the citi the inhabit were leav it and the
retreat troop were fill it why should that caus the mass to
riot
neither in moscow nor anywher in russia did anyth resembl an
insurrect ever occur when the enemi enter a town more than
ten thousand peopl were still in moscow on the first and second of
septemb and except for a mob in the governor courtyard assembl
there at hi bid noth happen it is obviou that there would
have been even less reason to expect a disturb among the peopl
if after the battl of borodin when the surrend of moscow becam
certain or at least probabl rostopchn instead of excit the peopl
by distribut arm and broadsheet had taken step to remov all
the holi relic the gunpowd munit and monei and had told the
popul plainli that the town would be abandon
rostopchn though he had patriot sentiment wa a sanguin and
impuls man who had alwai move in the highest administr circl
and had no understand at all of the peopl he suppos himself to
be guid ever sinc the enemi entri into smolnsk he had in
imagin been plai the role of director of the popular feel
of the heart of russia not onli did it seem to him as to all
administr that he control the extern action of moscow
inhabit but he also thought he control their mental attitud by
mean of hi broadsheet and poster written in a coars tone which the
peopl despis in their own class and do not understand from those in
author rostopchn wa so pleas with the fine role of leader of
popular feel and had grown so us to it that the necess of
relinquish that role and abandon moscow without ani heroic displai
took him unawar and he suddenli felt the ground slip awai from under
hi feet so that he posit did not know what to do though he knew
it wa come he did not till the last moment wholeheartedli believ
that moscow would be abandon and did not prepar for it the
inhabit left against hi wish if the govern offic were
remov thi wa onli done on the demand of offici to whom the count
yield reluctantli he wa absorb in the role he had creat
for himself as is often the case with those gift with an ardent
imagin though he had long known that moscow would be abandon he
knew it onli with hi intellect he did not believ it in hi heart and
did not adapt himself mental to thi new posit of affair
all hi painstak and energet activ in how far it wa us
and had ani effect on the peopl is anoth question had been simpli
direct toward arous in the mass hi own feel of patriot
hatr of the french
but when event assum their true histor charact when express
hatr for the french in word prove insuffici when it wa not
even possibl to express that hatr by fight a battl when
selfconfid wa of no avail in relat to the on question befor
moscow when the whole popul stream out of moscow as on man
abandon their belong and prove by that neg action all
the depth of their nation feel then the role chosen by rostopchn
suddenli appear senseless he unexpectedli felt himself ridicul
weak and alon with no ground to stand on
when awaken from hi sleep he receiv that cold peremptori note
from kutzov he felt the more irrit the more he felt himself
to blame all that he had been special put in charg of the state
properti which he should have remov wa still in moscow and it wa no
longer possibl to take the whole of it awai
who is to blame for it who ha let thing come to such a pass he
rumin not i of cours i had everyth readi i had moscow
firmli in hand and thi is what thei have let it come to villain
traitor he thought without clearli defin who the villain and
traitor were but feel it necessari to hate those traitor whoever
thei might be who were to blame for the fals and ridicul posit in
which he found himself

though tatter hungri worn out and reduc to a third of their
origin number the french enter moscow in good march order it
wa a weari and famish but still a fight and menac armi but
it remain an armi onli until it soldier had dispers into their
differ lodg as soon as the men of the variou regiment began
to dispers among the wealthi and desert hous the armi wa lost
forev and there came into be someth nondescript neither
citizen nor soldier but what ar known as maraud when five week
later these same men left moscow thei no longer form an armi thei
were a mob of maraud each carri a quantiti of articl which
seem to him valuabl or us the aim of each man when he left
moscow wa no longer as it had been to conquer but mere to keep
what he had acquir like a monkei which put it paw into the narrow
neck of a jug and have seiz a hand of nut will not open it
fist for fear of lose what it hold and therefor perish the
french when thei left moscow had inevit to perish becaus thei
carri their loot with them yet to abandon what thei had stolen wa as
imposs for them as it is for the monkei to open it paw and let
go of it nut ten minut after each regiment had enter a moscow
district not a soldier or offic wa left men in militari uniform
and hessian boot could be seen through the window laugh and
walk through the room in cellar and storeroom similar men were
busi among the provis and in the yard unlock or break open
coach hous and stabl door light fire in kitchen and knead
and bake bread with rolledup sleev and cook or frighten
amus or caress women and children there were mani such men both
in the shop and housesbut there wa no armi
order after order wa issu by the french command that dai
forbid the men to dispers about the town sternli forbid ani
violenc to the inhabit or ani loot and announc a roll call
for that veri even but despit all these measur the men who had
till then constitut an armi flow all over the wealthi desert
citi with it comfort and plenti suppli as a hungri herd of
cattl keep well togeth when cross a barren field but get out
of hand and at onc dispers uncontrol as soon as it reach rich
pastur so did the armi dispers all over the wealthi citi
no resid were left in moscow and the soldierslik water
percol through sandspread irresist through the citi in all
direct from the krmlin into which thei had first march the
cavalri on enter a merchant hous that had been abandon and
find there stabl more than suffici for their hors went on
all the same to the next hous which seem to them better mani of
them appropri sever hous chalk their name on them and
quarrel and even fought with other compani for them befor thei had
had time to secur quarter the soldier ran out into the street to
see the citi and hear that everyth had been abandon rush
to place where valuabl were to be had for the take the offic
follow to check the soldier and were involuntarili drawn into do
the same in carriag row carriag had been left in the shop and
gener flock there to select calch and coach for themselv
the few inhabit who had remain invit command offic to
their hous hope therebi to secur themselv from be plunder
there were mass of wealth and there seem no end to it all around
the quarter occupi by the french were other region still unexplor
and unoccupi where thei thought yet greater rich might be found
and moscow engulf the armi ever deeper and deeper when water is
spill on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and
mud result and in the same wai the entri of the famish armi into the
rich and desert citi result in fire and loot and the destruct
of both the armi and the wealthi citi
the french attribut the fire of moscow au patriotism froce de
rostopchn the russian to the barbar of the french in realiti
howev it wa not and could not be possibl to explain the burn
of moscow by make ani individu or ani group of peopl respons
for it moscow wa burn becaus it found itself in a posit in which
ani town built of wood wa bound to burn quit apart from whether it
had or had not a hundr and thirti inferior fire engin desert
moscow had to burn as inevit as a heap of shave ha to burn on
which spark continu fall for sever dai a town built of wood
where scarc a dai pass without conflagr when the hous owner
ar in resid and a polic forc is present cannot help burn when
it inhabit have left it and it is occupi by soldier who smoke
pipe make campfir of the senat chair in the senat squar and
cook themselv meal twice a dai in peacetim it is onli necessari to
billet troop in the villag of ani district and the number of fire in
that district immedi increas how much then must the probabl
of fire be increas in an abandon wooden town where foreign troop
ar quarter le patriotism froce de rostopchn and the barbar
of the french were not to blame in the matter moscow wa set on fire by
the soldier pipe kitchen and campfir and by the careless of
enemi soldier occupi hous thei did not own even if there wa ani
arson which is veri doubt for no on had ani reason to burn the
housesin ani case a troublesom and danger thing to do arson
cannot be regard as the caus for the same thing would have happen
without ani incendiar
to rostopchn feroci patriot
howev tempt it might be for the french to blame rostopchn
feroc and for russian to blame the scoundrel bonapart or later
on to place an heroic torch in the hand of their own peopl it is
imposs not to see that there could be no such direct caus of the
fire for moscow had to burn as everi villag factori or hous must
burn which is left by it owner and in which stranger ar allow to
live and cook their porridg moscow wa burn by it inhabit it
is true but by those who had abandon it and not by those who remain
in it moscow when occupi by the enemi did not remain intact like
berlin vienna and other town simpli becaus it inhabit
abandon it and did not welcom the french with bread and salt nor
bring them the kei of the citi
chapter xxvii
the absorpt of the french by moscow radiat starwis as it did
onli reach the quarter where pierr wa stai by the even of the
second of septemb
after the last two dai spent in solitud and unusu circumst
pierr wa in a state border on insan he wa complet obsess
by on persist thought he did not know how or when thi thought had
taken such possess of him but he rememb noth of the past
understood noth of the present and all he saw and heard appear to
him like a dream
he had left home onli to escap the intric tangl of life demand
that enmesh him and which in hi present condit he wa unabl
to unravel he had gone to joseph alexevich hous on the plea of
sort the deceas book and paper onli in search of rest from
life turmoil for in hi mind the memori of joseph alexevich wa
connect with a world of etern solemn and calm thought quit
contrari to the restless confus into which he felt himself be
drawn he sought a quiet refug and in joseph alexevich studi he
realli found it when he sat with hi elbow on the dusti write tabl
in the deathlik still of the studi calm and signific memori
of the last few dai rose on after anoth in hi imagin
particularli of the battl of borodin and of that vagu sens of hi
own insignific and insincer compar with the truth simplic
and strength of the class of men he mental class as thei when
gersim rous him from hi reveri the idea occur to him of take
part in the popular defens of moscow which he knew wa project and
with that object he had ask gersim to get him a peasant coat and
a pistol confid to him hi intent of remain in joseph
alexevich hous and keep hi name secret then dure the first
dai spent in inact and solitud he tri sever time to fix hi
attent on the mason manuscript but wa unabl to do so the idea
that had previous occur to him of the cabalist signific of
hi name in connect with bonapart more than onc vagu present
itself but the idea that he lruss besuhof wa destin to set a
limit to the power of the beast wa as yet onli on of the fanci that
often pass through hi mind and left no trace behind
when have bought the coat mere with the object of take part among
the peopl in the defens of moscow pierr had met the rostv and
natsha had said to him ar you remain in moscow how splendid
the thought flash into hi mind that it realli would be a good thing
even if moscow were taken for him to remain there and do what he wa
predestin to do
next dai with the sole idea of not spare himself and not lag in
ani wai behind them pierr went to the three hill gate but when he
return to the hous convinc that moscow would not be defend he
suddenli felt that what befor had seem to him mere a possibl
had now becom absolut necessari and inevit he must remain in
moscow conceal hi name and must meet napoleon and kill him and
either perish or put an end to the miseri of all europewhich it seem
to him wa sole due to napoleon
pierr knew all the detail of the attempt on bonapart life in 1809
by a german student in vienna and knew that the student had been shot
and the risk to which he would expos hi life by carri out hi
design excit him still more
two equal strong feel drew pierr irresist to thi purpos
the first wa a feel of the necess of sacrific and suffer in
view of the common calam the same feel that had caus him to go
to mozhysk on the twentyfifth and to make hi wai to the veri thick
of the battl and had now caus him to run awai from hi home and in
place of the luxuri and comfort to which he wa accustom to sleep
on a hard sofa without undress and eat the same food as gersim
the other wa that vagu and quit russian feel of contempt for
everyth convent artifici and humanfor everyth the
major of men regard as the greatest good in the world pierr had
first experienc thi strang and fascin feel at the slobda
palac when he had suddenli felt that wealth power and lifeal that
men so painstakingli acquir and guardif it ha ani worth ha so onli
by reason of the joi with which it can all be renounc
it wa the feel that induc a volunt recruit to spend hi last
penni on drink and a drunken man to smash mirror or glass for no
appar reason and know that it will cost him all the monei he
possess the feel which caus a man to perform action which from
an ordinari point of view ar insan to test as it were hi person
power and strength affirm the exist of a higher nonhuman
criterion of life
from the veri dai pierr had experienc thi feel for the first time
at the slobda palac he had been continu under it influenc but
onli now found full satisfact for it moreov at thi moment pierr
wa support in hi design and prevent from renounc it by what he
had alreadi done in that direct if he were now to leav moscow like
everyon els hi flight from home the peasant coat the pistol and
hi announc to the rostv that he would remain in moscow would all
becom not mere meaningless but contempt and ridicul and to
thi pierr wa veri sensit
pierr physic condit as is alwai the case correspond to hi
mental state the unaccustom coars food the vodka he drank dure
those dai the absenc of wine and cigar hi dirti unchang linen
two almost sleepless night pass on a short sofa without beddingal
thi kept him in a state of excit border on insan
it wa two oclock in the afternoon the french had alreadi enter
moscow pierr knew thi but instead of act he onli thought about
hi undertak go over it minutest detail in hi mind in hi
fanci he did not clearli pictur to himself either the strike of the
blow or the death of napoleon but with extraordinari vivid and
melancholi enjoy imagin hi own destruct and heroic endur
ye alon for the sake of all i must do it or perish he thought
ye i will approach and then suddenli with pistol or dagger
but that is all the same it is not i but the hand of provid that
punish thee i shall sai thought he imagin what he would sai
when kill napoleon well then take me and execut me he went on
speak to himself and bow hi head with a sad but firm express
while pierr stand in the middl of the room wa talk to himself
in thi wai the studi door open and on the threshold appear
the figur of makr alexevich alwai so timid befor but now quit
transform
hi dress gown wa unfasten hi face red and distort he
wa obvious drunk on see pierr he grew confus at first but
notic embarrass on pierr face immedi grew bold and
stagger on hi thin leg advanc into the middl of the room
theyr frighten he said confidenti in a hoars voic i sai i

the doctor he felt princ andrew puls and to hi surpris and
dissatisfact found it had improv he wa dissatisfi becaus he
knew by experi that if hi patient did not die now he would do so
a littl later with greater suffer timkhin the rednos major of
princ andrew regiment had join him in moscow and wa be
taken along with him have been wound in the leg at the battl of
borodin thei were accompani by a doctor princ andrew valet hi
coachman and two orderli
thei gave princ andrew some tea he drank it eagerli look with
feverish ey at the door in front of him as if try to understand and
rememb someth
i dont want ani more is timkhin here he ask
timkhin crept along the bench to him

princ andrew again ponder as if try to rememb someth
couldnt on get a book he ask
what book

the doctor promis to procur it for him and began to ask how he
wa feel princ andrew answer all hi question reluctantli but
reason and then said he want a bolster place under him as he wa
uncomfort and in great pain the doctor and valet lift the cloak
with which he wa cover and make wry face at the noisom smell of
mortifi flesh that came from the wound began examin that dread
place the doctor wa veri much displeas about someth and made a
chang in the dress turn the wound man over so that he groan
again and grew unconsci and deliri from the agoni he kept ask
them to get him the book and put it under him
what troubl would it be to you he said i have not got on pleas
get it for me and put it under for a moment he plead in a piteou
voic
the doctor went into the passag to wash hi hand
you fellow have no conscienc said he to the valet who wa pour
water over hi hand for just on moment i didnt look after you
it such pain you know that i wonder how he can bear it
by the lord jesu christ i thought we had put someth under him
said the valet
the first time princ andrew understood where he wa and what wa the
matter with him and rememb be wound and how wa when he ask
to be carri into the hut after hi calch had stop at mytshchi
after grow confus from pain while be carri into the hut he
again regain conscious and while drink tea onc more recal
all that had happen to him and abov all vividli rememb the
moment at the ambul station when at the sight of the suffer of
a man he dislik those new thought had come to him which promis him
happi and those thought though now vagu and indefinit again
possess hi soul he rememb that he had now a new sourc of
happi and that thi happi had someth to do with the gospel
that wa why he ask for a copi of them the uncomfort posit in
which thei had put him and turn him over again confus hi thought
and when he came to himself a third time it wa in the complet
still of the night everybodi near him wa sleep a cricket
chirp from across the passag someon wa shout and sing in
the street cockroach rustl on the tabl on the icon and on
the wall and a big fly flop at the head of the bed and around the
candl besid him the wick of which wa char and had shape itself
like a mushroom
hi mind wa not in a normal state a healthi man usual think of
feel and rememb innumer thing simultan but ha the
power and will to select on sequenc of thought or event on which to
fix hi whole attent a healthi man can tear himself awai from the
deepest reflect to sai a civil word to someon who come in and can
then return again to hi own thought but princ andrew mind wa not
in a normal state in that respect all the power of hi mind were more
activ and clearer than ever but thei act apart from hi will most
divers thought and imag occupi him simultan at time hi
brain suddenli began to work with a vigor clear and depth it had
never reach when he wa in health but suddenli in the midst of it
work it would turn to some unexpect idea and he had not the strength
to turn it back again
ye a new happi wa reveal to me of which man cannot be
depriv he thought as he lai in the semidark of the quiet hut
gaze fixedli befor him with feverish wide open ey a happi
ly beyond materi forc outsid the materi influenc that act
on mana happi of the soul alon the happi of love everi man
can understand it but to conceiv it and enjoin it wa possibl onli
for god but how did god enjoin that law and why wa the son
and suddenli the sequenc of these thought broke off and princ andrew
heard without know whether it wa a delus or realiti a
soft whisper voic incessantli and rhythmic repeat
pitipitip and then titi and then again pitipitip and
titi onc more at the same time he felt that abov hi face abov
the veri middl of it some strang airi structur wa be erect out
of slender needl or splinter to the sound of thi whisper music
he felt that he had to balanc carefulli though it wa difficult so
that thi airi structur should not collaps but nevertheless it kept
collaps and again slowli rise to the sound of whisper rhythmic
musicit stretch stretch spread out and stretch said
princ andrew to himself while listen to thi whisper and feel
the sensat of thi draw out and the construct of thi edific
of needl he also saw by glimps a red halo round the candl and
heard the rustl of the cockroach and the buzz of the fly that
flop against hi pillow and hi face each time the fly touch hi
face it gave him a burn sensat and yet to hi surpris it did not
destroi the structur though it knock against the veri region of hi
face where it wa rise but besid thi there wa someth els of
import it wa someth white by the doorth statu of a sphinx
which also oppress him
but perhap that my shirt on the tabl he thought and that my
leg and that is the door but why is it alwai stretch and draw
itself out and pitipitip and titi and pitipitip
that enough pleas leav off princ andrew painfulli entreat
someon and suddenli thought and feel again swam to the surfac of
hi mind with peculiar clear and forc
yeslov he thought again quit clearli but not love which love
for someth for some qualiti for some purpos or for some reason
but the love which iwhil dyingfirst experienc when i saw my enemi
and yet love him i experienc that feel of love which is the veri
essenc of the soul and doe not requir an object now again i feel
that bliss to love on neighbor to love on enemi to love

chapter iv
it is natur for us who were not live in those dai to imagin that
when half russia had been conquer and the inhabit were flee to
distant provinc and on levi after anoth wa be rais for the
defens of the fatherland all russian from the greatest to the least
were sole engag in sacrif themselv save their fatherland
or weep over it downfal the tale and descript of that time
without except speak onli of the selfsacrific patriot devot
despair grief and the heroism of the russian but it wa not realli
so it appear so to us becaus we see onli the gener histor
interest of that time and do not see all the person human interest
that peopl had yet in realiti those person interest of the moment
so much transcend the gener interest that thei alwai prevent the
public interest from be felt or even notic most of the peopl at
that time paid no attent to the gener progress of event but were
guid onli by their privat interest and thei were the veri peopl
whose activ at that period were most us
those who tri to understand the gener cours of event and to take
part in it by selfsacrific and heroism were the most useless member
of societi thei saw everyth upsid down and all thei did for the
common good turn out to be useless and foolishlik pierr and
mamnov regiment which loot russian villag and the lint the
young ladi prepar and that never reach the wound and so on
even those fond of intellectu talk and of express their feel
who discuss russia posit at the time involuntarili introduc
into their convers either a shade of pretens and falsehood or
useless condemn and anger direct against peopl accus of
action no on could possibl be guilti of in histor event the rule
forbid us to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledg is special
applic onli unconsci action bear fruit and he who plai a part
in an histor event never understand it signific if he tri to
realiz it hi effort ar fruitless
the more close a man wa engag in the event then take place in
russia the less did he realiz their signific in petersburg and
in the provinc at a distanc from moscow ladi and gentlemen in
militia uniform wept for russia and it ancient capit and talk of
selfsacrific and so on but in the armi which retir beyond moscow
there wa littl talk or thought of moscow and when thei caught sight
of it burn ruin no on swore to be aveng on the french but thei
thought about their next pai their next quarter of matrshka the
vivandir and like matter
as the war had caught him in the servic nichola rostv took a close
and prolong part in the defens of hi countri but did so casual
without ani aim at selfsacrific and he therefor look at what wa
go on in russia without despair and without dismal rack hi
brain over it had he been ask what he thought of the state of
russia he would have said that it wa not hi busi to think about
it that kutzov and other were there for that purpos but that he had
heard that the regiment were to be made up to their full strength that
fight would probabl go on for a long time yet and that thing be
so it wa quit like he might be in command of a regiment in a coupl
of year time
as he look at the matter in thi wai he learn that he wa be
sent to vornezh to bui remount for hi divis not onli without
regret at be prevent from take part in the come battl but
with the greatest pleasurewhich he did not conceal and which hi
comrad fulli understood
a few dai befor the battl of borodin nichola receiv the
necessari monei and warrant and have sent some hussar on in
advanc he set out with post hors for vornezh
onli a man who ha experienc itthat is ha pass some month

them he rejoic as though see all thi for the first time what for
a long while special surpris and delight him were the women young
and healthi without a dozen offic make up to each of them women
too who were pleas and flatter that a pass offic should joke
with them
in the highest spirit nichola arriv at night at a hotel in vornezh
order thing he had long been depriv of in camp and next dai veri
cleanshaven and in a fulldress uniform he had not worn for a long
time went to present himself to the author
the command of the militia wa a civilian gener an old man who wa
evid pleas with hi militari design and rank he receiv
nichola brusqu imagin thi to be characterist militari
and question him with an import air as if consid the gener
progress of affair and approv and disapprov with full right to do
so nichola wa in such good spirit that thi mere amus him
from the command of the militia he drove to the governor the governor
wa a brisk littl man veri simpl and affabl he indic the stud
farm at which nichola might procur hors recommend to him a hors
dealer in the town and a landown fourteen mile out of town who had
the best hors and promis to assist him in everi wai

take hi squadron quartermast with him drove at a gallop to the
landown fourteen mile awai who had the stud everyth seem to
him pleasant and easi dure that first part of hi stai in vornezh
and as usual happen when a man is in a pleasant state of mind
everyth went well and easili
the landown to whom nichola went wa a bachelor an old cavalryman a
hors fancier a sportsman the possessor of some centuryold brandi
and some old hungarian wine who had a snuggeri where he smoke and who
own some splendid hors

frame of mind continu urg on the driver so as to be in time for
the governor parti
when he had chang pour water over hi head and scent himself
nichola arriv at the governor rather late but with the phrase
better late than never on hi lip
it wa not a ball nor had danc been announc but everyon knew
that catherin petrvna would plai vals and the cossais on the
clavichord and that there would be danc and so everyon had come as
to a ball
provinci life in 1812 went on veri much as usual but with thi
differ that it wa liveli in the town in consequ of the
arriv of mani wealthi famili from moscow and as in everyth that
went on in russia at that time a special reckless wa notic an
in for a penni in for a poundwho care spirit and the inevit
small talk instead of turn on the weather and mutual acquaint
now turn on moscow the armi and napoleon
the societi gather togeth at the governor wa the best in
vornezh
there were a great mani ladi and some of nichola moscow
acquaint but there were no men who could at all vie with the
cavali of st georg the hussar remount offic the goodnatur
and wellbr count rostv among the men wa an italian prison an
offic of the french armi and nichola felt that the presenc of that
prison enhanc hi own import as a russian hero the italian
wa as it were a war trophi nichola felt thi it seem to him
that everyon regard the italian in the same light and he treat him
cordial though with digniti and restraint
as soon as nichola enter in hi hussar uniform diffus around him
a fragranc of perfum and wine and had utter the word better late
than never and heard them repeat sever time by other peopl
cluster around him all ey turn on him and he felt at onc
that he had enter into hi proper posit in the provincethat of
a univers favorit a veri pleasant posit and intoxicatingli so
after hi long privat at post station at inn and in the
landown snuggeri maidserv had been flatter by hi notic and
here too at the governor parti there were as it seem to nichola
an inexhaust number of pretti young women marri and unmarri
impati await hi notic the women and girl flirt with him
and from the first dai the peopl concern themselv to get thi
fine young daredevil of an hussar marri and settl down among these
wa the governor wife herself who welcom rostv as a near rel
and call him nichola
catherin petrvna did actual plai vals and the cossais and
danc began in which nichola still further captiv the provinci
societi by hi agil hi particularli free manner of danc even
surpris them all nichola wa himself rather surpris at the wai he
danc that even he had never danc like that in moscow and would
even have consid such a veri free and easi manner improp and in
bad form but here he felt it incumb on him to astonish them all by
someth unusu someth thei would have to accept as the regular
thing in the capit though new to them in the provinc
all the even nichola paid attent to a blueei plump and
pleas littl blond the wife of on of the provinci offici
with the nave convict of young men in a merri mood that other men
wive were creat for them rostv did not leav the ladi side and
treat her husband in a friendli and conspiratori style as if
without speak of it thei knew how capit nichola and the ladi
would get on togeth the husband howev did not seem to share that
convict and tri to behav moros with rostv but the
latter goodnatur navet wa so boundless that sometim even he
involuntarili yield to nichola good humor toward the end of the
even howev as the wife face grew more flush and anim the
husband becam more and more melancholi and solemn as though there
were but a given amount of anim between them and as the wife
share increas the husband diminish

improv without my have notic it and abov all what tact and
grace thought mademoisel bourienn
had princess mari been capabl of reflect at that moment she would
have been more surpris than mademoisel bourienn at the chang that
had taken place in herself from the moment she recogn that dear
love face a new life forc took possess of her and compel her to
speak and act apart from her own will from the time rostv enter her
face becam suddenli transform it wa as if a light had been kindl
in a carv and paint lantern and the intric skill artist
work on it side that previous seem dark coars and meaningless
wa suddenli shown up in unexpect and strike beauti for the first

with herself her suffer her strive after good her
meek love and selfsacrificeal thi now shone in those radiant

rostv saw all thi as clearli as if he had known her whole life he
felt that the be befor him wa quit differ from and better

their convers wa veri simpl and unimport thei spoke of the
war and like everyon els unconsci exagger their sorrow
about it thei spoke of their last meetingnichola try to chang the
subjectthei talk of the governor kind wife of nichola relat
and of princess mari
she did not talk about her brother divert the convers as soon
as her aunt mention andrew evid she could speak of russia
misfortun with a certain artifici but her brother wa too near
her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightli of him nichola
notic thi as he notic everi shade of princess mari charact
with an observ unusu to him and everyth confirm hi
convict that she wa a quit unusu and extraordinari be
nichola blush and wa confus when peopl spoke to him about the
princess as she did when he wa mention and even when he thought of
her but in her presenc he felt quit at eas and said not at all what
he had prepar but what quit appropri occur to him at the
moment
when a paus occur dure hi short visit nichola as is usual when
there ar children turn to princ andrew littl son caress him
and ask whether he would like to be an hussar he took the boi on
hi knee plai with him and look round at princess mari with a
soften happi timid look she watch the boi she love in the arm
of the man she love nichola also notic that look and as if
understand it flush with pleasur and began to kiss the boi with
good natur play
as she wa in mourn princess mari did not go out into societi and
nichola did not think it the proper thing to visit her again but all
the same the governor wife went on with her matchmak pass on to
nichola the flatter thing princess mari said of him and vice
versa and insist on hi declar himself to princess mari for thi
purpos she arrang a meet between the young peopl at the bishop
hous befor mass
though rostv told the governor wife that he would not make ani
declar to princess mari he promis to go
as at tilsit rostv had not allow himself to doubt that what everybodi
consid right wa right so now after a short but sincer struggl
between hi effort to arrang hi life by hi own sens of justic and
in obedi submiss to circumst he chose the latter and yield
to the power he felt irresist carri him he knew not where he
knew that after hi promis to snya it would be what he deem base to
declar hi feel to princess mari and he knew that he would never
act base but he also knew or rather felt at the bottom of hi heart
that by resign himself now to the forc of circumst and to those
who were guid him he wa not onli do noth wrong but wa do
someth veri importantmor import than anyth he had ever done
in hi life
after meet princess mari though the cours of hi life went on
extern as befor all hi former amus lost their charm for him
and he often thought about her but he never thought about her as he
had thought of all the young ladi without except whom he had met
in societi nor as he had for a long time and at on time raptur
thought about snya he had pictur each of those young ladi as
almost all honestheart young men do that is as a possibl wife
adapt her in hi imagin to all the condit of marri life
a white dress gown hi wife at the tea tabl hi wife carriag
littl on mamma and papa their relat to her and so onand these
pictur of the futur had given him pleasur but with princess mari
to whom thei were try to get him engag he could never pictur
anyth of futur marri life if he tri hi pictur seem
incongru and fals it made him afraid

when he receiv the new of the battl of borodin and the abandon
of moscow rostv wa not seiz with despair anger the desir for
vengeanc or ani feel of that kind but everyth in vornezh
suddenli seem to him dull and tiresom and he experienc an
indefinit feel of shame and awkward the convers he heard
seem to him insincer he did not know how to judg all these affair
and felt that onli in the regiment would everyth again becom clear
to him he made hast to finish bui the hors and often becam
unreason angri with hi servant and squadron quartermast
a few dai befor hi departur a special thanksgiv at which
nichola wa present wa held in the cathedr for the russian victori
he stood a littl behind the governor and held himself with militari
decorum through the servic medit on a great varieti of subject
when the servic wa over the governor wife beckon him to her
have you seen the princess she ask indic with a movement of
her head a ladi stand on the opposit side beyond the choir
nichola immedi recogn princess mari not so much by the profil
he saw under her bonnet as by the feel of solicitud timid and
piti that immedi overcam him princess mari evid engross
by her thought wa cross herself for the last time befor leav
the church
nichola look at her face with surpris it wa the same face he had
seen befor there wa the same gener express of refin inner
spiritu labor but now it wa quit differ lit up there wa a
pathet express of sorrow prayer and hope in it as had occur
befor when she wa present nichola went up to her without wait to
be prompt by the governor wife and not ask himself whether or not
it wa right and proper to address her here in church and told her he
had heard of her troubl and sympath with hi whole soul as soon as
she heard hi voic a vivid glow kindl in her face light up both
her sorrow and her joi
there is on thing i want to tell you princess said rostv it
is that if your brother princ andrew nikolevich were not live it
would have been at onc announc in the gazett as he is a colonel
the princess look at him not grasp what he wa sai but cheer
by the express of regret sympathi on hi face
and i have known so mani case of a splinter wound the gazett said
it wa a shell either prove fatal at onc or be veri slight
continu nichola we must hope for the best and i am sure
princess mari interrupt him
oh that would be so dread she began and prevent by agit
from finish she bent her head with a movement as grace as
everyth she did in hi presenc and look up at him gratefulli
went out follow her aunt
that even nichola did not go out but stai at home to settl some
account with the hors dealer when he had finish that busi it
wa alreadi too late to go anywher but still too earli to go to bed

life a thing he rare did
princess mari had made an agreeabl impress on him when he had met
her in smolnsk provinc hi have encount her in such except
circumst and hi mother have at on time mention her to him as
a good match had drawn hi particular attent to her when he met her
again in vornezh the impress she made on him wa not mere pleas
but power nichola had been struck by the peculiar moral beauti he
observ in her at thi time he wa howev prepar to go awai and
it had not enter hi head to regret that he wa thu depriv himself
of chanc of meet her but that dai encount in church had he
felt sunk deeper than wa desir for hi peac of mind that pale
sad refin face that radiant look those gentl grace gestur
and especi the deep and tender sorrow express in all her featur
agit him and evok hi sympathi in men rostv could not bear to
see the express of a higher spiritu life that wa why he did not
like princ andrew and he refer to it contemptu as philosophi
and dreami but in princess mari that veri sorrow which reveal
the depth of a whole spiritu world foreign to him wa an irresist
attract
she must be a wonder woman a real angel he said to himself

involuntarili compar the two the lack of spiritu in the on and
the abund of it in the othera spiritu he himself lack and
therefor valu most highli he tri to pictur what would happen were
he free how he would propos to her and how she would becom hi wife
but no he could not imagin that he felt aw and no clear pictur
present itself to hi mind he had long ago pictur to himself a
futur with snya and that wa all clear and simpl just becaus it
had all been thought out and he knew all there wa in snya but it wa
imposs to pictur a futur with princess mari becaus he did not
understand her but simpli love her
reveri about snya had had someth merri and play in them but to
dream of princess mari wa alwai difficult and a littl frighten
how she prai he thought it wa plain that her whole soul wa in
her prayer ye that wa the prayer that move mountain and i am
sure her prayer will be answer why dont i prai for what i want he
suddenli thought what do i want to be free releas from snya
she wa right he thought rememb what the governor wife had
said noth but misfortun can come of marri snya muddl
grief for mamma busi difficulti muddl terribl muddl
besid i dont love hernot as i should o god releas me from
thi dread inextric posit he suddenli began to prai ye
prayer can move mountain but on must have faith and not prai as
natsha and i us to as children that the snow might turn into
sugarand then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so no
but i am not prai for trifl now he thought as he put hi pipe
down in a corner and fold hi hand place himself befor the icon
soften by memori of princess mari he began to prai as he had not
done for a long time tear were in hi ey and in hi throat when the
door open and lavrshka came in with some paper

him had come to pass but nichola wa as much astonish as if it were
someth extraordinari and unexpect and as if the veri fact that it
had happen so quickli prove that it had not come from god to whom he
had prai but by some ordinari coincid
thi unexpect and as it seem to nichola quit voluntari letter
from snya freed him from the knot that fetter him and from which
there had seem no escap she wrote that the last unfortun

worthi of nichola whom she love more than anyth in the world but

need to sacrific herself but made other sacrific themselv for
her and yet wa belov by everybodi and for the first time snya felt

chapter ix
the offic and soldier who had arrest pierr treat him with
hostil but yet with respect in the guardhous to which he wa taken
in their attitud toward him could still be felt both uncertainti as
to who he might beperhap a veri import personand hostil as a
result of their recent person conflict with him
but when the guard wa reliev next morn pierr felt that for the
new guardboth offic and menh wa not as interest as he had
been to hi captor and in fact the guard of the second dai did not
recogn in thi big stout man in a peasant coat the vigor person
who had fought so desper with the maraud and the convoi and had
utter those solemn word about save a child thei saw in him onli
no 17 of the captur russian arrest and detain for some reason
by order of the higher command if thei notic anyth remark
about pierr it wa onli hi unabash medit concentr
and thought and the wai he spoke french which struck them as
surprisingli good in spite of thi he wa place that dai with the
other arrest suspect as the separ room he had occupi wa
requir by an offic
all the russian confin with pierr were men of the lowest class and
recogn him as a gentleman thei all avoid him more especi as
he spoke french pierr felt sad at hear them make fun of him
that even he learn that all these prison he probabl among
them were to be tri for incendiar on the third dai he wa taken
with the other to a hous where a french gener with a white mustach
sat with two colonel and other frenchmen with scarv on their arm
with the precis and definit customari in address prison
and which is suppos to preclud human frailti pierr like the other
wa question as to who he wa where he had been with what object
and so on
these question like question put at trial gener left the
essenc of the matter asid shut out the possibl of that essenc
be reveal and were design onli to form a channel through which
the judg wish the answer of the accus to flow so as to lead to
the desir result name a convict as soon as pierr began to sai
anyth that did not fit in with that aim the channel wa remov and
the water could flow to wast pierr felt moreov what the accus
alwai feel at their trial perplex as to why these question were
put to him he had a feel that it wa onli out of condescens or a
kind of civil that thi devic of place a channel wa emploi he
knew he wa in these men power that onli by forc had thei brought
him there that forc alon gave them the right to demand answer
to their question and that the sole object of that assembl wa to
inculp him and so as thei had the power and wish to inculp
him thi expedi of an inquiri and trial seem unnecessari it wa
evid that ani answer would lead to convict when ask what he
wa do when he wa arrest pierr repli in a rather tragic manner
that he wa restor to it parent a child he had save from the
flame why had he fought the maraud pierr answer that he wa
protect a woman and that to protect a woman who wa be insult
wa the duti of everi man that thei interrupt him for thi
wa not to the point why wa he in the yard of a burn hous where
wit had seen him he repli that he had gone out to see what
wa happen in moscow again thei interrupt him thei had not ask
where he wa go but why he wa found near the fire who wa he thei
ask repeat their first question which he had declin to answer
again he repli that he could not answer it
put that down that bad veri bad sternli remark the gener
with the white mustach and red flush face
on the fourth dai fire broke out on the zbovski rampart
pierr and thirteen other were move to the coach hous of a merchant
hous near the crimean bridg on hi wai through the street pierr
felt stifl by the smoke which seem to hang over the whole
citi fire were visibl on all side he did not then realiz the
signific of the burn of moscow and look at the fire with
horror
he pass four dai in the coach hous near the crimean bridg and
dure that time learn from the talk of the french soldier that all
those confin there were await a decis which might come ani dai
from the marshal what marshal thi wa pierr could not learn from the
soldier evid for them the marshal repres a veri high and
rather mysteri power
these first dai befor the eighth of septemb when the prison were
had up for a second examin were the hardest of all for pierr
chapter x
on the eighth of septemb an officera veri import on judg by
the respect the guard show himent the coach hous where the
prison were thi offic probabl someon on the staff wa hold
a paper in hi hand and call over all the russian there name
pierr as the man who doe not give hi name glanc indol and
indiffer at all the prison he order the offic in charg
to have them decent dress and tidi up befor take them to the
marshal an hour later a squad of soldier arriv and pierr with
thirteen other wa led to the virgin field it wa a fine dai sunni
after rain and the air wa unusu pure the smoke did not hang low
as on the dai when pierr had been taken from the guardhous on the
zbovski rampart but rose through the pure air in column no flame
were seen but column of smoke rose on all side and all moscow as far
as pierr could see wa on vast char ruin on all side there were
wast space with onli stove and chimnei stack still stand and
here and there the blacken wall of some brick hous pierr gaze
at the ruin and did not recogn district he had known well here and
there he could see church that had not been burn the krmlin which
wa not destroi gleam white in the distanc with it tower and
the belfri of ivn the great the dome of the new convent of the virgin
glitter brightli and it bell were ring particularli clearli
these bell remind pierr that it wa sundai and the feast of the
nativ of the virgin but there seem to be no on to celebr thi
holidai everywher were blacken ruin and the few russian to be
seen were tatter and frighten peopl who tri to hide when thei saw
the french
it wa plain that the russian nest wa ruin and destroi but in
place of the russian order of life that had been destroi pierr
unconsci felt that a quit differ firm french order had been
establish over thi ruin nest he felt thi in the look of
the soldier who march in regular rank briskli and gaili were
escort him and the other crimin he felt it in the look of an
import french offici in a carriag and pair driven by a soldier
whom thei met on the wai he felt it in the merri sound of regiment
music he heard from the left side of the field and felt and realiz
it especi from the list of prison the french offic had read out
when he came that morn pierr had been taken by on set of soldier
and led first to on and then to anoth place with dozen of other men
and it seem that thei might have forgotten him or confus him with
the other but no the answer he had given when question had come
back to him in hi design as the man who doe not give hi name
and under that appel which to pierr seem terribl thei were
now lead him somewher with unhesit assur on their face
that he and all the other prison were exactli the on thei want
and that thei were be taken to the proper place pierr felt himself
to be an insignific chip fallen among the wheel of a machin whose
action he did not understand but which wa work well
he and the other prison were taken to the right side of the virgin
field to a larg white hous with an immens garden not far from the
convent thi wa princ shcherbtov hous where pierr had often
been in other dai and which as he learn from the talk of the
soldier wa now occupi by the marshal the duke of eckmhl davout
thei were taken to the entranc and led into the hous on by on
pierr wa the sixth to enter he wa conduct through a glass galleri
an anteroom and a hall which were familiar to him into a long low
studi at the door of which stood an adjut
davout spectacl on nose sat bent over a tabl at the further end of
the room pierr went close up to him but davout evid consult
a paper that lai befor him did not look up without rais hi ey
he said in a low voic
who ar you
pierr wa silent becaus he wa incap of utter a word to him
davout wa not mere a french gener but a man notori for hi
cruelti look at hi cold face as he sat like a stern schoolmast
who wa prepar to wait awhil for an answer pierr felt that everi
instant of delai might cost him hi life but he did not know what
to sai he did not ventur to repeat what he had said at hi first
examin yet to disclos hi rank and posit wa danger and
embarrass so he wa silent but befor he had decid what to do
davout rais hi head push hi spectacl back on hi forehead
screw up hi ey and look intent at him
i know that man he said in a cold measur tone evid
calcul to frighten pierr
the chill that had been run down pierr back now seiz hi head
as in a vise
you cannot know me gener i have never seen you
he is a russian spy davout interrupt address anoth gener
who wa present but whom pierr had not notic

at on anoth and that look save pierr apart from condit of war
and law that look establish human relat between the two men at
that moment an immens number of thing pass dimli through both their
mind and thei realiz that thei were both children of human and
were brother
at the first glanc when davout had onli rais hi head from the
paper where human affair and live were indic by number pierr
wa mere a circumst and davout could have shot him without
burden hi conscienc with an evil deed but now he saw in him a
human be he reflect for a moment
how can you show me that you ar tell the truth said davout
coldli
pierr rememb rambal and name him and hi regiment and the
street where the hous wa
you ar not what you sai return davout
in a trembl falter voic pierr began adduc proof of the
truth of hi statement
but at that moment an adjut enter and report someth to davout
davout brighten up at the new the adjut brought and began
button up hi uniform it seem that he had quit forgotten pierr
when the adjut remind him of the prison he jerk hi head in

factori hand a thin sallowfac lad of eighteen in a loos coat
pierr heard the french consult whether to shoot them separ or
two at a time in coupl repli the offic in command in a calm
voic there wa a stir in the rank of the soldier and it wa evid
that thei were all hurryingnot as men hurri to do someth thei
understand but as peopl hurri to finish a necessari but unpleas and
incomprehens task
a french offici wear a scarf came up to the right of the row of
prison and read out the sentenc in russian and in french
then two pair of frenchmen approach the crimin and at the
offic command took the two convict who stood first in the row the
convict stop when thei reach the post and while sack were be

bound them to the post
twelv sharpshoot with musket step out of the rank with a firm
regular tread and halt eight pace from the post pierr turn awai
to avoid see what wa go to happen suddenli a crackl roll
nois wa heard which seem to him louder than the most terrif
thunder and he look round there wa some smoke and the frenchmen
were do someth near the pit with pale face and trembl hand
two more prison were led up in the same wai and with similar look
these two glanc vainli at the onlook with onli a silent appeal for
protect in their ey evid unabl to understand or believ
what wa go to happen to them thei could not believ it becaus thei
alon knew what their life meant to them and so thei neither understood
nor believ that it could be taken from them
again pierr did not wish to look and again turn awai but again the
sound as of a fright explos struck hi ear and at the same moment
he saw smoke blood and the pale scare face of the frenchmen who
were again do someth by the post their trembl hand imped
on anoth pierr breath heavili look around as if ask what
it meant the same question wa express in all the look that met hi
on the face of all the russian and of the french soldier and offic
without except he read the same dismai horror and conflict that
were in hi own heart but who after all is do thi thei ar all
suffer as i am who then is it who flash for an instant through
hi mind
sharpshoot of the 86th forward shout someon the fifth

understand that he wa save that he and the rest had been brought
there onli to wit the execut with evergrow horror and no
sens of joi or relief he gaze at what wa take place the fifth man
wa the factori lad in the loos cloak the moment thei laid hand on
him he sprang asid in terror and clutch at pierr pierr shudder
and shook himself free the lad wa unabl to walk thei drag him
along hold him up under the arm and he scream when thei got
him to the post he grew quiet as if he suddenli understood someth
whether he understood that scream wa useless or whether he thought
it incred that men should kill him at ani rate he took hi stand at
the post wait to be blindfold like the other and like a wound
anim look around him with glitter ey
pierr wa no longer abl to turn awai and close hi ey hi curios
and agit like that of the whole crowd reach the highest pitch
at thi fifth murder like the other thi fifth man seem calm he
wrap hi loos cloak closer and rub on bare foot with the other
when thei began to blindfold him he himself adjust the knot which
hurt the back of hi head then when thei prop him against the
bloodstain post he lean back and not be comfort in that
posit straighten himself adjust hi feet and lean back again
more comfort pierr did not take hi ey from him and did not miss
hi slightest movement
probabl a word of command wa given and wa follow by the report of
eight musket but try as he would pierr could not afterward rememb
have heard the slightest sound of the shot he onli saw how the
workman suddenli sank down on the cord that held him how blood show
itself in two place how the rope slacken under the weight of the
hang bodi and how the workman sat down hi head hang unnatur
and on leg bent under him pierr ran up to the post no on hinder
him pale frighten peopl were do someth around the workman
the lower jaw of an old frenchman with a thick mustach trembl as he
unti the rope the bodi collaps the soldier drag it awkwardli
from the post and began push it into the pit
thei all plainli and certainli knew that thei were crimin who must
hide the trace of their guilt as quickli as possibl
pierr glanc into the pit and saw that the factori lad wa ly with
hi knee close up to hi head and on shoulder higher than the other
that shoulder rose and fell rhythmic and convuls but spade
of earth were alreadi be thrown over the whole bodi on of the
soldier evid suffer shout gruffli and angrili at pierr to
go back but pierr did not understand him and remain near the post
and no on drove him awai
when the pit had been fill up a command wa given pierr wa taken
back to hi place and the row of troop on both side of the post
made a half turn and went past it at a measur pace the twentyfour
sharpshoot with discharg musket stand in the center of the
circl ran back to their place as the compani pass by
pierr gaze now with daze ey at these sharpshoot who ran in
coupl out of the circl all but on rejoin their compani thi
on a young soldier hi face deadli pale hi shako push back and
hi musket rest on the ground still stood near the pit at the spot
from which he had fire he swai like a drunken man take some step
forward and back to save himself from fall an old noncommiss
offic ran out of the rank and take him by the elbow drag him to
hi compani the crowd of russian and frenchmen began to dispers thei
all went awai silent and with droop head

pierr glanc round at the speaker and saw that it wa a soldier who
wa try to find some relief after what had been done but wa not
abl to do so without finish what he had begun to sai he made a
hopeless movement with hi arm and went awai

made no kind of deduct from or applic of them he repli to
question thei put to him but did not consid who wa listen to hi
repli nor how thei would understand them he look at their face
and figur but thei all seem to him equal meaningless
from the moment pierr had wit those terribl murder commit by
men who did not wish to commit them it wa as if the mainspr of
hi life on which everyth depend and which made everyth appear
aliv had suddenli been wrench out and everyth had collaps
into a heap of meaningless rubbish though he did not acknowledg it to

befor but never so strongli as now when similar doubt had assail
him befor thei had been the result of hi own wrongdo and at the
bottom of hi heart he had felt that relief from hi despair and from
those doubt wa to be found within himself but now he felt that
the univers had crumbl befor hi ey and onli meaningless ruin

in hi power to regain faith in the mean of life
around him in the dark men were stand and evid someth
about him interest them greatli thei were tell him someth and
ask him someth then thei led him awai somewher and at last he

chapter xiii
twentythre soldier three offic and two offici were confin
in the shed in which pierr had been place and where he remain for
four week
when pierr rememb them afterward thei all seem misti figur to
him except platn karatev who alwai remain in hi mind a most
vivid and preciou memori and the personif of everyth russian
kindli and round when pierr saw hi neighbor next morn at dawn
the first impress of him as of someth round wa fulli confirm
platn whole figurein a french overcoat girdl with a cord a
soldier cap and bast shoeswa round hi head wa quit round hi
back chest shoulder and even hi arm which he held as if ever
readi to embrac someth were round hi pleasant smile and hi
larg gentl brown ey were also round
platn karatev must have been fifti judg by hi stori of
campaign he had been in told as by an old soldier he did not himself
know hi ag and wa quit unabl to determin it but hi brilliantli
white strong teeth which show in two unbroken semicircl when he
laugheda he often didwer all sound and good there wa not a grai
hair in hi beard or on hi head and hi whole bodi gave an impress
of suppl and especi of firm and endur
hi face despit it fine round wrinkl had an express of
innoc and youth hi voic wa pleasant and music but the chief
peculiar of hi speech wa it direct and apposit it wa
evid that he never consid what he had said or wa go to sai
and consequ the rapid and justic of hi inton had an
irresist persuas
hi physic strength and agil dure the first dai of hi
imprison were such that he seem not to know what fatigu and
sick meant everi night befor ly down he said lord lai me
down as a stone and rais me up as a loaf and everi morn on get
up he said i lai down and curl up i get up and shake myself and
inde he onli had to lie down to fall asleep like a stone and he
onli had to shake himself to be readi without a moment delai for some
work just as children ar readi to plai directli thei awak he could
do everyth not veri well but not badli he bake cook sew
plane and mend boot he wa alwai busi and onli at night allow
himself conversationof which he wa fondand song he did not sing
like a train singer who know he is listen to but like the bird
evid give vent to the sound in the same wai that on stretch
oneself or walk about to get rid of stiff and the sound were
alwai highpitch mourn delic and almost feminin and hi
face at such time wa veri seriou
have been taken prison and allow hi beard to grow he seem to
have thrown off all that had been forc upon himeveryth militari
and alien to himselfand had return to hi former peasant habit
a soldier on leavea shirt outsid breech he would sai
he did not like talk about hi life as a soldier though he did not
complain and often mention that he had not been flog onc dure
the whole of hi armi servic when he relat anyth it wa gener
some old and evid preciou memori of hi christian life as he
call hi peasant exist the proverb of which hi talk wa full
were for the most part not the coars and indec saw soldier
emploi but those folk sai which taken without a context seem so
insignific but when us apposit suddenli acquir a signific
of profound wisdom
he would often sai the exact opposit of what he had said on a previou
occas yet both would be right he like to talk and he talk well
adorn hi speech with term of endear and with folk sai which
pierr thought he invent himself but the chief charm of hi talk lai
in the fact that the commonest eventssometim just such as pierr
had wit without take notic of themassum in karatev a
charact of solemn fit he like to hear the folk tale on of the
soldier us to tell of an even thei were alwai the same but
most of all he like to hear stori of real life he would smile
joyfulli when listen to such stori now and then put in a word
or ask a question to make the moral beauti of what he wa told clear
to himself karatev had no attach friendship or love as pierr
understood them but love and live affection with everyth life
brought him in contact with particularli with mannot ani particular
man but those with whom he happen to be he love hi dog hi
comrad the french and pierr who wa hi neighbor but pierr felt
that in spite of karatev affection tender for him by which
he unconsci gave pierr spiritu life it due he would not have
griev for a moment at part from him and pierr began to feel in
the same wai toward karatev
to all the other prison platn karatev seem a most ordinari
soldier thei call him littl falcon or platsha chaf him
goodnaturedli and sent him on errand but to pierr he alwai
remain what he had seem that first night an unfathom round
etern personif of the spirit of simplic and truth
platn karatev knew noth by heart except hi prayer when he began
to speak he seem not to know how he would conclud
sometim pierr struck by the mean of hi word would ask him to
repeat them but platn could never recal what he had said a moment
befor just as he never could repeat to pierr the word of hi
favorit song nativ and birch tree and my heart is sick occur in
it but when spoken and not sung no mean could be got out of it he
did not and could not understand the mean of word apart from
their context everi word and action of hi wa the manifest of
an activ unknown to him which wa hi life but hi life as he
regard it had no mean as a separ thing it had mean onli as
part of a whole of which he wa alwai consciou hi word and action
flow from him as evenli inevit and spontan as fragranc
exhal from a flower he could not understand the valu or signific
of ani word or deed taken separ

chapter xvi
not onli did princ andrew know he would die but he felt that he wa
dy and wa alreadi half dead he wa consciou of an aloof from
everyth earthli and a strang and joyou light of exist
without hast or agit he await what wa come that inexor
etern distant and unknown the presenc of which he had felt
continu all hi lifewa now near to him and by the strang
light he experienc almost comprehens and palpabl
formerli he had fear the end he had twice experienc that terribl
torment fear of deathth endbut now he no longer understood that
fear
he had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top befor
him and he look at the fallow field the bush and the sky and
knew that he wa face to face with death when he came to himself after
be wound and the flower of etern unfett love had instantli
unfold itself in hi soul as if freed from the bondag of life that
had restrain it he no longer fear death and ceas to think about
it
dure the hour of solitud suffer and partial delirium he
spent after he wa wound the more deepli he penetr into the new
principl of etern love reveal to him the more he unconsci
detach himself from earthli life to love everyth and everybodi and
alwai to sacrific oneself for love meant not to love anyon not
to live thi earthli life and the more imbu he becam with that
principl of love the more he renounc life and the more complet he
destroi that dread barrier whichin the absenc of such lovestand
between life and death when dure those first dai he rememb that
he would have to die he said to himself well what of it so much the
better
but after the night in mytshchi when half deliri he had seen her
for whom he long appear befor him and have press her hand to hi
lip had shed gentl happi tear love for a particular woman again
crept unobserv into hi heart and onc more bound him to life and
joy and agit thought began to occupi hi mind recal the
moment at the ambul station when he had seen kurgin he could not
now regain the feel he then had but wa torment by the question
whether kurgin wa aliv and he dare not inquir
hi ill pursu it normal physic cours but what natsha
refer to when she said thi suddenli happen had occur two
dai befor princess mari arriv it wa the last spiritu struggl
between life and death in which death gain the victori it wa
the unexpect realiz of the fact that he still valu life as
present to him in the form of hi love for natsha and a last though
ultim vanquish attack of terror befor the unknown
it wa even as usual after dinner he wa slightli feverish and hi
thought were preternatur clear snya wa sit by the tabl he
began to doze suddenli a feel of happi seiz him
ah she ha come thought he
and so it wa in snya place sat natsha who had just come in
noiselessli
sinc she had begun look after him he had alwai experienc thi
physic conscious of her near she wa sit in an armchair
place sidewai screen the light of the candl from him and wa
knit a stock she had learn to knit stock sinc princ
andrew had casual mention that no on nurs the sick so well as old
nurs who knit stock and that there is someth sooth in
the knit of stock the needl click lightli in her slender
rapidli move hand and he could clearli see the thought profil
of her droop face she move and the ball roll off her knee she
start glanc round at him and screen the candl with her hand
stoop carefulli with a suppl and exact movement pick up the ball
and regain her former posit
he look at her without move and saw that she want to draw a
deep breath after stoop but refrain from do so and breath
cautious
at the tritsa monasteri thei had spoken of the past and he had told
her that if he live he would alwai thank god for hi wound which had
brought them togeth again but after that thei never spoke of the
futur
can it or can it not be he now thought as he look at her and
listen to the light click of the steel needl can fate have brought
me to her so strang onli for me to die is it possibl that the
truth of life ha been reveal to me onli to show me that i have spent
my life in falsiti i love her more than anyth in the world but what
am i to do if i love her he thought and he involuntarili groan
from a habit acquir dure hi suffer
on hear that sound natsha put down the stock lean nearer to
him and suddenli notic hi shine ey step lightli up to him
and bent over him
you ar not asleep
no i have been look at you a long time i felt you come in no on
els give me that sens of soft tranquil that you do that light
i want to weep for joi
natsha drew closer to him her face shone with raptur joi
natsha i love you too much more than anyth in the world
and ish turn awai for an instant why too much she ask
why too much well what do you what do you feel in your soul your
whole soulshal i live what do you think
i am sure of it sure natsha almost shout take hold of both hi
hand with a passion movement
he remain silent awhil
how good it would be and take her hand he kiss it
natsha felt happi and agit but at onc rememb that thi would
not do and that he had to be quiet
but you have not slept she said repress her joi try to sleep
pleas
he press her hand and releas it and she went back to the candl and
sat down again in her former posit twice she turn and look at
him and her ey met hi beam at her she set herself a task on her
stock and resolv not to turn round till it wa finish
soon he realli shut hi ey and fell asleep he did not sleep long and
suddenli awok with a start and in a cold perspir
as he fell asleep he had still been think of the subject that now
alwai occupi hi mindabout life and death and chiefli about death
he felt himself nearer to it
love what is love he thought
love hinder death love is life all everyth that i understand i
understand onli becaus i love everyth is everyth exist onli
becaus i love everyth is unit by it alon love is god and to
die mean that i a particl of love shall return to the gener and
etern sourc these thought seem to him comfort but thei were
onli thought someth wa lack in them thei were not clear thei
were too onesidedli person and brainspun and there wa the former
agit and obscur he fell asleep
he dream that he wa ly in the room he realli wa in but that
he wa quit well and unwound mani variou indiffer and
insignific peopl appear befor him he talk to them and
discuss someth trivial thei were prepar to go awai somewher
princ andrew dimli realiz that all thi wa trivial and that he had
more import care but he continu to speak surpris them by
empti wittic gradual unnot all these person began to
disappear and a singl question that of the close door supersed
all els he rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it everyth
depend on whether he wa or wa not in time to lock it he went and
tri to hurri but hi leg refus to move and he knew he would not be
in time to lock the door though he painfulli strain all hi power he
wa seiz by an agon fear and that fear wa the fear of death it
stood behind the door but just when he wa clumsili creep toward
the door that dread someth on the other side wa alreadi press
against it and forc it wai in someth not humandeathwa
break in through that door and had to be kept out he seiz the
door make a final effort to hold it backto lock it wa no longer
possiblebut hi effort were weak and clumsi and the door push from
behind by that terror open and close again
onc again it push from outsid hi last superhuman effort were vain
and both halv of the door noiselessli open it enter and it wa
death and princ andrew di
but at the instant he di princ andrew rememb that he wa asleep
and at the veri instant he di have made an effort he awok
ye it wa death i diedand woke up ye death is an awaken and
all at onc it grew light in hi soul and the veil that had till then
conceal the unknown wa lift from hi spiritu vision he felt as
if power till then confin within him had been liber and that
strang light did not again leav him
when wake in a cold perspir he move on the divan natsha went
up and ask him what wa the matter he did not answer and look at
her strang not understand
that wa what had happen to him two dai befor princess mari
arriv from that dai as the doctor express it the wast fever
assum a malign charact but what the doctor said did not interest
natsha she saw the terribl moral symptom which to her were more
convinc
from that dai an awaken from life came to princ andrew togeth with
hi awaken from sleep and compar to the durat of life it did
not seem to him slower than an awaken from sleep compar to the
durat of a dream
there wa noth terribl or violent in thi compar slow
awaken
hi last dai and hour pass in an ordinari and simpl wai both
princess mari and natsha who did not leav him felt thi thei did
not weep or shudder and dure these last dai thei themselv felt
that thei were not attend on him he wa no longer there he had left
them but on what remind them most close of himhi bodi both felt
thi so strongli that the outward and terribl side of death did not
affect them and thei did not feel it necessari to foment their grief
neither in hi presenc nor out of it did thei weep nor did thei ever
talk to on anoth about him thei felt that thei could not express in
word what thei understood
thei both saw that he wa sink slowli and quietli deeper and deeper
awai from them and thei both knew that thi had to be so and that it
wa right
he confess and receiv communion everyon came to take leav of
him when thei brought hi son to him he press hi lip to the boi
and turn awai not becaus he felt it hard and sad princess mari and
natsha understood that but simpli becaus he thought it wa all that
wa requir of him but when thei told him to bless the boi he did
what wa demand and look round as if ask whether there wa
anyth els he should do
when the last convuls of the bodi which the spirit wa leav
occur princess mari and natsha were present
is it over said princess mari when hi bodi had for a few minut
lain motionless grow cold befor them natsha went up look at
the dead ey and hasten to close them she close them but did not

person grief thei wept with a rever and soften emot which
had taken possess of their soul at the conscious of the
simpl and solemn mysteri of death that had been accomplish in their
presenc
book thirteen 1812
chapter i
man mind cannot grasp the caus of event in their complet but
the desir to find those caus is implant in man soul and without
consid the multipl and complex of the condit ani on
of which taken separ mai seem to be the caus he snatch at the
first approxim to a caus that seem to him intellig and sai
thi is the caus in histor event where the action of men ar
the subject of observ the first and most primit approxim
to present itself wa the will of the god and after that the will of
those who stood in the most promin positionth hero of histori
but we need onli penetr to the essenc of ani histor eventwhich
li in the activ of the gener mass of men who take part in itto
be convinc that the will of the histor hero doe not control the
action of the mass but is itself continu control it mai seem
to be a matter of indiffer whether we understand the mean of
histor event thi wai or that yet there is the same differ
between a man who sai that the peopl of the west move on the east
becaus napoleon wish it and a man who sai that thi happen becaus
it had to happen as there is between those who declar that the
earth wa stationari and that the planet move round it and those who
admit that thei did not know what upheld the earth but knew there
were law direct it movement and that of the other planet there
is and can be no caus of an histor event except the on caus of
all caus but there ar law direct event and some of these law
ar known to us while we ar consciou of other we cannot comprehend
the discoveri of these law is onli possibl when we have quit
abandon the attempt to find the caus in the will of some on man
just as the discoveri of the law of the motion of the planet wa
possibl onli when men abandon the concept of the fixiti of the
earth
the historian consid that next to the battl of borodin and the
occup of moscow by the enemi and it destruct by fire the most
import episod of the war of 1812 wa the movement of the russian
armi from the ryazna to the kalga road and to the tartino campth
socal flank march across the krsnaya pakhr river thei ascrib the
glori of that achiev of geniu to differ men and disput as to
whom the honor is due even foreign historian includ the french
acknowledg the geniu of the russian command when thei speak of
that flank march but it is hard to understand why militari writer
and follow them other consid thi flank march to be the profound
concept of some on man who save russia and destroi napoleon in
the first place it is hard to understand where the profund and geniu
of thi movement lai for not much mental effort wa need to see that
the best posit for an armi when it is not be attack is where
there ar most provis and even a dull boi of thirteen could have
guess that the best posit for an armi after it retreat from moscow
in 1812 wa on the kalga road so it is imposs to understand by
what reason the historian reach the conclus that thi maneuv
wa a profound on and it is even more difficult to understand just why
thei think that thi maneuv wa calcul to save russia and destroi
the french for thi flank march had it been preced accompani
or follow by other circumst might have prove ruinou to the
russian and salutari for the french if the posit of the russian
armi realli began to improv from the time of that march it doe not at
all follow that the march wa the caus of it
that flank march might not onli have fail to give ani advantag to
the russian armi but might in other circumst have led to it
destruct what would have happen had moscow not burn down if
murat had not lost sight of the russian if napoleon had not remain
inact if the russian armi at krsnaya pakhr had given battl as
bennigsen and barclai advis what would have happen had the french
attack the russian while thei were march beyond the pakhr what
would have happen if on approach tartino napoleon had attack
the russian with but a tenth of the energi he had shown when he
attack them at smolnsk what would have happen had the french move
on petersburg in ani of these eventu the flank march that
brought salvat might have prove disastr
the third and most incomprehens thing is that peopl studi
histori deliber avoid see that thi flank march cannot be
attribut to ani on man that no on ever foresaw it and that in
realiti like the retreat from fil it did not suggest itself to anyon
in it entireti but resultedmo by moment step by step event by
eventfrom an endless number of most divers circumst and wa onli
seen in it entireti when it had been accomplish and belong to the
past
at the council at fil the prevail thought in the mind of the
russian command wa the on natur suggest itself name a
direct retreat by the nzhni road in proof of thi there is the fact
that the major of the council vote for such a retreat and abov
all there is the wellknown convers after the council between the
command in chief and lanski who wa in charg of the commissariat
depart lanski inform the command in chief that the armi
suppli were for the most part store along the ok in the tla and
ryazn provinc and that if thei retreat on nzhni the armi would
be separ from it suppli by the broad river ok which cannot be
cross earli in winter thi wa the first indic of the necess
of deviat from what had previous seem the most natur coursea
direct retreat on nzhninvgorod the armi turn more to the south
along the ryazn road and nearer to it suppli subsequ the
inact of the french who even lost sight of the russian armi
concern for the safeti of the arsen at tla and especi the
advantag of draw nearer to it suppli caus the armi to turn
still further south to the tla road have cross over by a forc
march to the tla road beyond the pakhr the russian command
intend to remain at podlsk and had no thought of the tartino
posit but innumer circumst and the reappear of french
troop who had for a time lost touch with the russian and project
of give battl and abov all the abund of provis in kalga
provinc oblig our armi to turn still more to the south and to cross
from the tla to the kalga road and go to tartino which wa between
the road along which those suppli lai just as it is imposs to
sai when it wa decid to abandon moscow so it is imposs to sai
precis when or by whom it wa decid to move to tartino onli
when the armi had got there as the result of innumer and vari
forc did peopl begin to assur themselv that thei had desir thi
movement and long ago foreseen it result
chapter ii
the famou flank movement mere consist in thi after the advanc
of the french had ceas the russian armi which had been continu
retreat straight back from the invad deviat from that direct
cours and not find itself pursu wa natur drawn toward the
district where suppli were abund
if instead of imagin to ourselv command of geniu lead the
russian armi we pictur that armi without ani leader it could not
have done anyth but make a return movement toward moscow describ
an arc in the direct where most provis were to be found and where
the countri wa richest
that movement from the nzhni to the ryazn tla and kalga road wa
so natur that even the russian maraud move in that direct and
demand were sent from petersburg for kutzov to take hi armi that
wai at tartino kutzov receiv what wa almost a reprimand from
the emperor for have move hi armi along the ryazn road and the

kutzov merit lai not in ani strateg maneuv of geniu as it is

kutzov repli i should be curs by poster were i look on as
the initi of a settlement of ani sort such is the present spirit
of my nation but he continu to exert all hi power to restrain hi
troop from attack
dure the month that the french troop were pillag in moscow and
the russian troop were quietli encamp at tartino a chang had taken
place in the rel strength of the two armiesboth in spirit and in
numbera a result of which the superior had pass to the russian
side though the condit and number of the french armi were unknown
to the russian as soon as that chang occur the need of attack
at onc show itself by countless sign these sign were lauriston
mission the abund of provis at tartino the report come in
from all side of the inact and disord of the french the flow of
recruit to our regiment the fine weather the long rest the russian
soldier had enjoi and the impati to do what thei had been
assembl for which usual show itself in an armi that ha been
rest curios as to what the french armi so long lost sight of
wa do the bold with which our outpost now scout close up to
the french station at tartino the new of easi success gain by
peasant and guerrilla troop over the french the envi arous by thi
the desir for reveng that lai in the heart of everi russian as long as
the french were in moscow and abov all a dim conscious in everi
soldier mind that the rel strength of the armi had chang and
that the advantag wa now on our side there wa a substanti chang
in the rel strength and an advanc had becom inevit and at
onc as a clock begin to strike and chime as soon as the minut hand

activ whir and chime in the higher sphere
chapter iii
the russian armi wa command by kutzov and hi staff and also by the
emperor from petersburg befor the new of the abandon of moscow
had been receiv in petersburg a detail plan of the whole campaign
had been drawn up and sent to kutzov for hi guidanc though thi plan
had been drawn up on the supposit that moscow wa still in our hand
it wa approv by the staff and accept as a basi for action
kutzov onli repli that movement arrang from a distanc were alwai
difficult to execut so fresh instruct were sent for the solut
of difficulti that might be encount as well as fresh peopl who
were to watch kutzov action and report upon them
besid thi the whole staff of the russian armi wa now reorgan
the post left vacant by bagratin who had been kill and by
barclai who had gone awai in dudgeon had to be fill veri seriou
consider wa given to the question whether it would be better to
put a in bs place and b in ds or on the contrari to put d in as
place and so ona if anyth more than as or bs satisfact
depend on thi
as a result of the hostil between kutzov and bennigsen hi chief of
staff the presenc of confidenti repres of the emperor and
these transfer a more than usual complic plai of parti
wa go on among the staff of the armi a wa undermin b d wa
undermin c and so on in all possibl combin and permut
in all these plot the subject of intrigu wa gener the conduct
of the war which all these men believ thei were direct but thi
affair of the war went on independ of them as it had to go
that is never in the wai peopl devis but flow alwai from the
essenti attitud of the mass onli in the highest sphere did
all these scheme cross and intermingl appear to be a true
reflect of what had to happen
princ michael ilarinovich wrote the emperor on the second of octob
in a letter that reach kutzov after the battl at tartino sinc
septemb 2 moscow ha been in the hand of the enemi your last report
were written on the twentieth and dure all thi time not onli ha
no action been taken against the enemi or for the relief of the ancient
capit but accord to your last report you have even retreat
farther srpukhov is alreadi occupi by an enemi detach and tla
with it famou arsen so indispens to the armi is in danger
from gener wintzingerod report i see that an enemi corp of ten
thousand men is move on the petersburg road anoth corp of sever
thousand men is move on dmtrov a third ha advanc along the
vladmir road and a fourth rather consider detach is station
between rza and mozhysk napoleon himself wa in moscow as late as
the twentyfifth in view of all thi inform when the enemi ha
scatter hi forc in larg detach and with napoleon and hi
guard in moscow is it possibl that the enemi forc confront you
ar so consider as not to allow of your take the offens on the
contrari he is probabl pursu you with detach or at most with
an armi corp much weaker than the armi entrust to you it would seem
that avail yourself of these circumst you might advantag
attack a weaker on and annihil him or at least oblig him to
retreat retain in our hand an import part of the provinc now
occupi by the enemi and therebi avert danger from tla and other
town in the interior you will be respons if the enemi is abl to
direct a forc of ani size against petersburg to threaten thi capit
in which it ha not been possibl to retain mani troop for with the
armi entrust to you and act with resolut and energi you have
ampl mean to avert thi fresh calam rememb that you have still
to answer to our offend countri for the loss of moscow you have
experienc my readi to reward you that readi will not weaken
in me but i and russia have a right to expect from you all the zeal
firm and success which your intellect militari talent and the
courag of the troop you command justifi us in expect
but by the time thi letter which prove that the real relat of
the forc had alreadi made itself felt in petersburg wa dispatch
kutzov had found himself unabl ani longer to restrain the armi he
command from attack and a battl had taken place
on the second of octob a cossack shapovlov who wa out scout
kill on hare and wound anoth follow the wound hare he made
hi wai far into the forest and came upon the left flank of murat
armi encamp there without ani precaut the cossack laughingli
told hi comrad how he had almost fallen into the hand of the french
a cornet hear the stori inform hi command
the cossack wa sent for and question the cossack offic wish
to take advantag of thi chanc to captur some hors but on of
the superior offic who wa acquaint with the higher author
report the incid to a gener on the staff the state of thing on
the staff had of late been exceedingli strain ermlov had been to
see bennigsen a few dai previous and had entreat him to us
hi influenc with the command in chief to induc him to take the
offens
if i did not know you i should think you did not want what you ar
ask for i need onli advis anyth and hi high is sure to do
the opposit repli bennigsen
the cossack report confirm by hors patrol who were sent out wa
the final proof that event had matur the tightli coil spring wa
releas the clock began to whirr and the chime to plai despit all
hi suppos power hi intellect hi experi and hi knowledg
of men kutzovhav taken into consider the cossack report a
note from bennigsen who sent person report to the emperor the wish
he suppos the emperor to hold and the fact that all the gener
express the same wishcould no longer check the inevit movement
and gave the order to do what he regard as useless and harmfulgav
hi approv that is to the accomplish fact
chapter iv
bennigsen note and the cossack inform that the left flank
of the french wa unguard were mere final indic that it wa
necessari to order an attack and it wa fix for the fifth of octob
on the morn of the fourth of octob kutzov sign the disposit
toll read them to ermlov ask him to attend to the further
arrang
all rightal right i havent time just now repli ermlov and
left the hut
the disposit drawn up by toll were veri good as in the austerlitz
disposit it wa writtenthough not in german thi time
the first column will march here and here the second column will
march there and there and so on and on paper all these column
arriv at their place at the appoint time and destroi the enemi
everyth had been admir thought out as is usual in disposit
and as is alwai the case not a singl column reach it place at the
appoint time
when the necessari number of copi of the disposit had been
prepar an offic wa summon and sent to deliv them to ermlov
to deal with a young offic of the hors guard kutzov orderli
pleas at the import of the mission entrust to him went to
ermlov quarter
gone awai said ermlov orderli
the offic of the hors guard went to a gener with whom ermlov wa
often to be found
no and the gener out too
the offic mount hi hors rode off to someon els
no he gone out
if onli thei dont make me respons for thi delai what a nuisanc
it is thought the offic and he rode round the whole camp on man
said he had seen ermlov ride past with some other gener other said
he must have return home the offic search till six oclock in the
even without even stop to eat ermlov wa nowher to be found
and no on knew where he wa the offic snatch a littl food at
a comrad and rode again to the vanguard to find milordovich
milordovich too wa awai but here he wa told that he had gone to a
ball at gener kkin and that ermlov wa probabl there too
but where is it
why there over at chkino said a cossack offic point to a
countri hous in the far distanc
what outsid our line
theyv put two regiment as outpost and theyr have such a spree
there it aw two band and three set of singer
the offic rode out beyond our line to chkino while still at a
distanc he heard as he rode the merri sound of a soldier danc song
proceed from the hous
in the meadow in the meadow he heard accompani by whistl
and the sound of a torban drown everi now and then by shout these
sound made hi spirit rise but at the same time he wa afraid that
he would be blame for not have execut sooner the import order
entrust to him it wa alreadi past eight oclock he dismount
and went up into the porch of a larg countri hous which had remain
intact between the russian and french forc in the refresh room
and the hall footmen were bustl about with wine and viand group
of singer stood outsid the window the offic wa admit and
immedi saw all the chief gener of the armi togeth and among
them ermlov big impos figur thei all had their coat unbutton
and were stand in a semicircl with flush and anim face
laugh loudli in the middl of the room a short handsom gener with
a red face wa danc the trepk with much spirit and agil
ha ha ha bravo nichola ivnych ha ha ha
the offic felt that by arriv with import order at such a moment
he wa doubli to blame and he would have prefer to wait but on of
the gener espi him and hear what he had come about inform
ermlov
ermlov came forward with a frown on hi face and hear what the
offic had to sai took the paper from him without a word
you think he went off just by chanc said a comrad who wa on the
staff that even to the offic of the hors guard refer to
ermlov it wa a trick it wa done on purpos to get konovntsyn into
troubl youll see what a mess therel be tomorrow
chapter v
next dai the decrepit kutzov have given order to be call earli
said hi prayer dress and with an unpleas conscious of
have to direct a battl he did not approv of got into hi calch
and drove from letashvka a villag three and a half mile from
tartino to the place where the attack column were to meet he sat
in the calch doze and wake up by turn and listen for ani
sound of fire on the right as an indic that the action had begun
but all wa still quiet a damp dull autumn morn wa just dawn on
approach tartino kutzov notic cavalrymen lead their hors to
water across the road along which he wa drive kutzov look at
them searchingli stop hi carriag and inquir what regiment thei
belong to thei belong to a column that should have been far in
front and in ambush long befor then it mai be a mistak thought
the old command in chief but a littl further on he saw infantri
regiment with their arm pile and the soldier onli partli dress
eat their rye porridg and carri fuel he sent for an offic the
offic report that no order to advanc had been receiv
how not rec kutzov began but check himself immedi and
sent for a senior offic get out of hi calch he wait with
droop head and breath heavili pace silent up and down when
ekhen the offic of the gener staff whom he had summon appear
kutzov went purpl in the face not becaus that offic wa to blame
for the mistak but becaus he wa an object of suffici import
for him to vent hi wrath on trembl and pant the old man fell
into that state of furi in which he sometim us to roll on the
ground and he fell upon ekhen threaten him with hi hand
shout and load him with gross abus anoth man captain brzin
who happen to turn up and who wa not at all to blame suffer the
same fate
what sort of anoth blackguard ar you ill have you shot
scoundrel yell kutzov in a hoars voic wave hi arm and
reel
he wa suffer physic he the command in chief a seren
high who everybodi said possess power such as no man had ever had
in russia to be place in thi positionmad the laughingstock of the
whole armi i neednt have been in such a hurri to prai about todai
or have kept awak think everyth over all night thought he to
himself when i wa a chit of an offic no on would have dare to
mock me so and now he wa in a state of physic suffer as if
from corpor punish and could not avoid express it by cri of
anger and distress but hi strength soon began to fail him and look
about him consciou of have said much that wa amiss he again got
into hi calch and drove back in silenc
hi wrath onc expend did not return and blink feebli he
listen to excus and selfjustif ermlov did not come to see
him till the next dai and to the insist of bennigsen konovntsyn
and toll that the movement that had miscarri should be execut next
dai and onc more kutzov had to consent
chapter vi
next dai the troop assembl in their appoint place in the even

chapter vii
meanwhil anoth column wa to have attack the french from the front
but kutzov accompani that column he well knew that noth but
confus would come of thi battl undertaken against hi will and as
far as wa in hi power held the troop back he did not advanc
he rode silent on hi small grai hors indol answer
suggest that thei should attack
the word attack is alwai on your tongu but you dont see that we ar
unabl to execut complic maneuv said he to milordovich who
ask permiss to advanc
we couldnt take murat prison thi morn or get to the place in
time and noth can be done now he repli to someon els
when kutzov wa inform that at the french rearwher accord to the
report of the cossack there had previous been nobodyther were now
two battalion of pole he gave a sidelong glanc at ermlov who wa
behind him and to whom he had not spoken sinc the previou dai
you see thei ar ask to attack and make plan of all kind
but as soon as on get to busi noth is readi and the enemi
forewarn take measur accordingli
ermlov screw up hi ey and smile faintli on hear these word
he understood that for him the storm had blown over and that kutzov
would content himself with that hint
he have a littl fun at my expens said ermlov softli nudg
with hi knee ravski who wa at hi side
soon after thi ermlov move up to kutzov and respectfulli remark
it is not too late yet your highnessth enemi ha not gone awayif
you were to order an attack if not the guard will not so much as see
a littl smoke
kutzov did not repli but when thei report to him that murat troop
were in retreat he order an advanc though at everi hundr pace he
halt for three quarter of an hour
the whole battl consist in what orlvdensov cossack had done
the rest of the armi mere lost some hundr of men uselessli
in consequ of thi battl kutzov receiv a diamond decor
and bennigsen some diamond and a hundr thousand rubl other also
receiv pleasant recognit correspond to their variou grade
and follow the battl fresh chang were made in the staff
that how everyth is done with us all topsyturvi said the
russian offic and gener after the tartino battl let it be
understood that some fool there is do thing all wrong but that
we ourselv should not have done so just as peopl speak todai but
peopl who talk like that either do not know what thei ar talk about
or deliber deceiv themselv no battletartino borodin or
austerlitztak place as those who plan it anticip that is an
essenti condit
a countless number of free forc for nowher is man freer than dure
a battl where it is a question of life and death influenc the cours
taken by the fight and that cours never can be known in advanc and
never coincid with the direct of ani on forc
if mani simultan and various direct forc act on a given
bodi the direct of it motion cannot coincid with ani on of those
forc but will alwai be a meanwhat in mechan is repres by
the diagon of a parallelogram of forc
if in the descript given by historian especi french on we
find their war and battl carri out in accord with previous
form plan the onli conclus to be drawn is that those descript
ar fals
the battl of tartino obvious did not attain the aim toll had in
viewto lead the troop into action in the order prescrib by the
disposit nor that which count orlvdensov mai have had in viewto
take murat prison nor the result of immedi destroi the whole
corp which bennigsen and other mai have had in view nor the aim of
the offic who wish to go into action to distinguish himself nor
that of the cossack who want more booti than he got and so on but
if the aim of the battl wa what actual result and what all the
russian of that dai desiredto drive the french out of russia and
destroi their armyit is quit clear that the battl of tartino just
becaus of it incongru wa exactli what wa want at that stage
of the campaign it would be difficult and even imposs to imagin
ani result more opportun than the actual outcom of thi battl with
a minimum of effort and insignific loss despit the greatest
confus the most import result of the whole campaign were
attain the transit from retreat to advanc an exposur of the
weak of the french and the administr of that shock which
napoleon armi had onli await to begin it flight
chapter viii
napoleon enter moscow after the brilliant victori de la moskowa there
can be no doubt about the victori for the battlefield remain in the
hand of the french the russian retreat and abandon their ancient
capit moscow abound in provis arm munit and
incalcul wealth is in napoleon hand the russian armi onli half
the strength of the french doe not make a singl attempt to attack for
a whole month napoleon posit is most brilliant he can either fall
on the russian armi with doubl it strength and destroi it negoti
an advantag peac or in case of a refus make a menac move on
petersburg or even in the case of a revers return to smolnsk or
vlna or remain in moscow in short no special geniu would seem to be
requir to retain the brilliant posit the french held at that time
for that onli veri simpl and easi step were necessari not to allow
the troop to loot to prepar winter clothingof which there wa
suffici in moscow for the whole armyand method to collect the
provis of which accord to the french historian there were
enough in moscow to suppli the whole armi for six month yet napoleon
that greatest of all genius who the historian declar had control of
the armi took none of these step
he not mere did noth of the kind but on the contrari he us hi
power to select the most foolish and ruinou of all the cours open
to him of all that napoleon might have done winter in moscow
advanc on petersburg or on nzhninvgorod or retir by a more
northerli or more southerli rout sai by the road kutzov afterward
took noth more stupid or disastr can be imagin than what he
actual did he remain in moscow till octob let the troop
plunder the citi then hesit whether to leav a garrison behind
him he quit moscow approach kutzov without join battl
turn to the right and reach mloyaroslvet again without
attempt to break through and take the road kutzov took but retir
instead to mozhysk along the devast smolnsk road noth more
stupid than that could have been devis or more disastr for the
armi as the sequel show had napoleon aim been to destroi hi armi
the most skill strategist could hardli have devis ani seri
of action that would so complet have accomplish that purpos
independ of anyth the russian armi might do
napoleon the man of geniu did thi but to sai that he destroi hi
armi becaus he wish to or becaus he wa veri stupid would be as
unjust as to sai that he had brought hi troop to moscow becaus he
wish to and becaus he wa veri clever and a geniu
in both case hi person activ have no more forc than the
person activ of ani soldier mere coincid with the law that
guid the event
the historian quit fals repres napoleon faculti as have
weaken in moscow and do so onli becaus the result did not justifi
hi action he emploi all hi abil and strength to do the best he
could for himself and hi armi as he had done previous and as he did
subsequ in 1813 hi activ at that time wa no less astound
than it wa in egypt in itali in austria and in prussia we do not
know for certain in how far hi geniu wa genuin in egyptwher forti
centuri look down upon hi grandeurfor hi great exploit there ar
all told us by frenchmen we cannot accur estim hi geniu in
austria or prussia for we have to draw our inform from french
or german sourc and the incomprehens surrend of whole corp
without fight and of fortress without a sieg must inclin german
to recogn hi geniu as the onli explan of the war carri on
in germani but we thank god have no need to recogn hi geniu
in order to hide our shame we have paid for the right to look at the
matter plainli and simpli and we will not abandon that right
hi activ in moscow wa as amaz and as full of geniu as
elsewher order after order and plan after plan were issu by him
from the time he enter moscow till the time he left it the absenc
of citizen and of a deput and even the burn of moscow did not
disconcert him he did not lose sight either of the welfar of hi
armi or of the do of the enemi or of the welfar of the peopl
of russia or of the direct of affair in pari or of diplomat
consider concern the term of the anticip peac
chapter ix
with regard to militari matter napoleon immedi on hi entri into
moscow gave gener sabastiani strict order to observ the movement
of the russian armi sent armi corp out along the differ road and
charg murat to find kutzov then he gave care direct about the
fortif of the krmlin and drew up a brilliant plan for a futur
campaign over the whole map of russia
with regard to diplomat question napoleon summon captain ykovlev
who had been rob and wa in rag and did not know how to get out of
moscow minut explain to him hi whole polici and hi magnanim
and have written a letter to the emperor alexand in which he
consid it hi duti to inform hi friend and brother that rostopchn

tranquil and eas of mind he had formerli striven in vain to reach
he had long sought in differ wai that tranquil of mind that
inner harmoni which had so impress him in the soldier at the battl
of borodin he had sought it in philanthropi in freemasonri in the
dissip of town life in wine in heroic feat of selfsacrific
and in romant love for natsha he had sought it by reasoningand all
these quest and experi had fail him and now without think
about it he had found that peac and inner harmoni onli through the
horror of death through privat and through what he recogn in
karatev
those dread moment he had live through at the execut had as it
were forev wash awai from hi imagin and memori the agit
thought and feel that had formerli seem so import it did
not now occur to him to think of russia or the war or polit or
napoleon it wa plain to him that all these thing were no busi
of hi and that he wa not call on to judg concern them and
therefor could not do so russia and summer weather ar not bound
togeth he thought repeat word of karatev which he found
strang consol hi intent of kill napoleon and hi
calcul of the cabalist number of the beast of the apocalyps now
seem to him meaningless and even ridicul hi anger with hi wife
and anxieti that hi name should not be smirch now seem not mere
trivial but even amus what concern wa it of hi that somewher or

and destroi the desir and possibl of have an occup
all pierr daydream now turn on the time when he would be free yet
subsequ and for the rest of hi life he thought and spoke with
enthusiasm of that month of captiv of those irrecover strong
joy sensat and chiefli of the complet peac of mind and inner
freedom which he experienc onli dure those week
when on the first dai he got up earli went out of the shed at dawn and
saw the cupola and cross of the new convent of the virgin still dark
at first the hoarfrost on the dusti grass the sparrow hill and the
wood bank abov the wind river vanish in the purpl distanc
when he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the nois of the
crow fly from moscow across the field and when afterward light
gleam from the east and the sun rim appear solemnli from behind a
cloud and the cupola and cross the hoarfrost the distanc and the
river all began to sparkl in the glad lightpierr felt a new joi and
strength in life such as he had never befor known and thi not onli
stai with him dure the whole of hi imprison but even grew in
strength as the hardship of hi posit increas
that feel of alert and of readi for anyth wa still
further strengthen in him by the high opinion hi fellow prison

chapter xiv
through the cross street of the khamvniki quarter the prison

belong to that escort but when thei reach the suppli store thei
came among a huge and close pack train of artilleri mingl with
privat vehicl

transmoskv ward and the kalga road converg and the prison jam
close togeth had to stand for some hour at that crosswai from all
side like the roar of the sea were heard the rattl of wheel the
tramp of feet and incess shout of anger and abus pierr stood

again as at the church in khamvniki a wave of gener curios
bore all the prison forward onto the road and pierr thank to
hi statur saw over the head of the other what so attract their
curios in three carriag involv among the munit cart close
squeez togeth sat women with roug face dress in glare
color who were shout someth in shrill voic
from the moment pierr had recogn the appear of the mysteri
forc noth had seem to him strang or dread neither the corps
smear with soot for fun nor these women hurri awai nor the burn
ruin of moscow all that he now wit scarc made an impress
on hima if hi soul make readi for a hard struggl refus to
receiv impress that might weaken it
the women vehicl drove by behind them came more cart soldier
wagon soldier gun carriag carriag soldier ammunit cart
more soldier and now and then women
pierr did not see the peopl as individu but saw their movement
all these peopl and hors seem driven forward by some invis
power dure the hour pierr watch them thei all came flow from
the differ street with on and the same desir to get on quickli
thei all jostl on anoth began to grow angri and to fight white
teeth gleam brow frown ever the same word of abus flew from
side to side and all the face bore the same swaggeringli resolut
and coldli cruel express that had struck pierr that morn on the
corpor face when the drum were beat
it wa not till nearli even that the offic command the escort
collect hi men and with shout and quarrel forc hi wai in among
the baggag train and the prison hem in on all side emerg
onto the kalga road
thei march veri quickli without rest and halt onli when the sun
began to set the baggag cart drew up close togeth and the men
began to prepar for their night rest thei all appear angri and
dissatisfi for a long time oath angri shout and fight could
be heard from all side a carriag that follow the escort ran
into on of the cart and knock a hole in it with it pole sever
soldier ran toward the cart from differ side some beat the
carriag hors on their head turn them asid other fought among
themselv and pierr saw that on german wa badli wound on the head
by a sword
it seem that all these men now that thei had stop amid field
in the chill dusk of the autumn even experienc on and the same
feel of unpleas awaken from the hurri and eager to push on
that had seiz them at the start onc at a standstil thei all seem
to understand that thei did not yet know where thei were go and that
much that wa pain and difficult await them on thi journei
dure thi halt the escort treat the prison even wors than thei
had done at the start it wa here that the prison for the first time
receiv horseflesh for their meat ration
from the offic down to the lowest soldier thei show what seem like
person spite against each of the prison in unexpect contrast to
their former friendli relat
thi spite increas still more when on call over the roll of
prison it wa found that in the bustl of leav moscow on russian
soldier who had pretend to suffer from colic had escap pierr saw
a frenchman beat a russian soldier cruelli for strai too far from
the road and heard hi friend the captain reprimand and threaten to
courtmarti a noncommiss offic on account of the escap of the
russian to the noncommiss offic excus that the prison wa
ill and could not walk the offic repli that the order wa to shoot
those who lag behind pierr felt that that fatal forc which had
crush him dure the execut but which he had not felt dure hi
imprison now again control hi exist it wa terribl but
he felt that in proport to the effort of that fatal forc to crush
him there grew and strengthen in hi soul a power of life independ
of it
he at hi supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chat with hi
comrad
neither pierr nor ani of the other spoke of what thei had seen in
moscow or of the rough of their treatment by the french or of the
order to shoot them which had been announc to them as if in reaction
against the worsen of their posit thei were all particularli
anim and gai thei spoke of person reminisc of amus
scene thei had wit dure the campaign and avoid all talk of
their present situat
the sun had set long sinc bright star shone out here and there in the
sky a red glow as of a conflagr spread abov the horizon from the
rise full moon and that vast red ball swai strang in the grai
haze it grew light the even wa end but the night had not yet
come pierr got up and left hi new companion cross between the
campfir to the other side of the road where he had been told the
common soldier prison were station he want to talk to them on
the road he wa stop by a french sentinel who order him back
pierr turn back not to hi companion by the campfir but to an
unhar cart where there wa nobodi tuck hi leg under him and
drop hi head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of the
cart and remain motionless a long while sunk in thought suddenli he
burst out into a fit of hi broad goodnatur laughter so loud that
men from variou side turn with surpris to see what thi strang and
evid solitari laughter could mean
hahaha laugh pierr and he said aloud to himself the soldier
did not let me pass thei took me and shut me up thei hold me captiv

till tear start to hi ey
a man got up and came to see what thi queer big fellow wa laugh at
all by himself pierr stop laugh got up went farther awai from
the inquisit man and look around him
the huge endless bivouac that had previous resound with the
crackl of campfir and the voic of mani men had grown quiet the
red campfir were grow paler and dy down high up in the light
sky hung the full moon forest and field beyond the camp unseen
befor were now visibl in the distanc and farther still beyond
those forest and field the bright oscil limitless distanc
lure on to itself pierr glanc up at the sky and the twinkl
star in it farawai depth and all that is me all that is within me
and it is all i thought pierr and thei caught all that and put it
into a shed board up with plank he smile and went and lai down to
sleep besid hi companion
chapter xv
in the earli dai of octob anoth envoi came to kutzov with a letter
from napoleon propos peac and fals date from moscow though
napoleon wa alreadi not far from kutzov on the old kalga road
kutzov repli to thi letter as he had done to the on formerli
brought by lauriston sai that there could be no question of peac
soon after that a report wa receiv from drokhov guerrilla
detach oper to the left of tartino that troop of broussier
divis had been seen at formnsk and that be separ from the
rest of the french armi thei might easili be destroi the soldier and
offic again demand action gener on the staff excit by the
memori of the easi victori at tartino urg kutzov to carri out
drokhov suggest kutzov did not consid ani offens necessari
the result wa a compromis which wa inevit a small detach wa
sent to formnsk to attack broussier
by a strang coincid thi task which turn out to be a most
difficult and import on wa entrust to dokhtrovthat same modest
littl dokhtrov whom no on had describ to us as draw up plan
of battl dash about in front of regiment shower cross on
batteri and so on and who wa thought to be and wa spoken of as
undecid and undiscerningbut whom we find command wherev the
posit wa most difficult all through the russofrench war from
austerlitz to the year 1813 at austerlitz he remain last at the
augezd dam ralli the regiment save what wa possibl when all
were fly and perish and not a singl gener wa left in the rear
guard ill with fever he went to smolnsk with twenti thousand men
to defend the town against napoleon whole armi in smolnsk at the
malkhov gate he had hardli doze off in a paroxysm of fever befor he
wa awaken by the bombard of the townand smolnsk held out all
dai long at the battl of borodin when bagratin wa kill and nine
tenth of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full forc of the
french artilleri fire wa direct against it the man sent there wa
thi same irresolut and undiscern dokhtrovkutzov hasten to
rectifi a mistak he had made by send someon els there first
and the quiet littl dokhtrov rode thither and borodin becam the
greatest glori of the russian armi mani hero have been describ to
us in vers and prose but of dokhtrov scarc a word ha been said
it wa dokhtrov again whom thei sent to formnsk and from there to
mloyaroslvet the place where the last battl with the french wa
fought and where the obviou disintegr of the french armi began
and we ar told of mani genius and hero of that period of the
campaign but of dokhtrov noth or veri littl is said and that
dubious and thi silenc about dokhtrov is the clearest testimoni to
hi merit
it is natur for a man who doe not understand the work of a
machin to imagin that a shave that ha fallen into it by chanc
and is interf with it action and toss about in it is it most
import part the man who doe not understand the construct of
the machin cannot conceiv that the small connect cogwheel which
revolv quietli is on of the most essenti part of the machin and
not the shave which mere harm and hinder the work
on the tenth of octob when dokhtrov had gone halfwai to formnsk and
stop at the villag of aristvo prepar faithfulli to execut the
order he had receiv the whole french armi have in it convuls
movement reach murat posit appar in order to give
battlesuddenli without ani reason turn off to the left onto the new
kalga road and began to enter formnsk where onli broussier had
been till then at that time dokhtrov had under hi command besid
drokhov detach the two small guerrilla detach of figner and
seslvin
on the even of octob 11 seslvin came to the aristvo headquart
with a french guardsman he had captur the prison said that the
troop that had enter formnsk that dai were the vanguard of the whole
armi that napoleon wa there and the whole armi had left moscow four
dai previous that same even a hous serf who had come from
brovsk said he had seen an immens armi enter the town some
cossack of dokhtrov detach report have sight the french
guard march along the road to brovsk from all these report it wa
evid that where thei had expect to meet a singl divis there
wa now the whole french armi march from moscow in an unexpect
directionalong the kalga road dokhtrov wa unwil to undertak
ani action as it wa not clear to him now what he ought to do he had
been order to attack formnsk but onli broussier had been there at
that time and now the whole french armi wa there ermlov wish to act
on hi own judgment but dokhtrov insist that he must have kutzov
instruct so it wa decid to send a dispatch to the staff
for thi purpos a capabl offic bolkhovtinov wa chosen who
wa to explain the whole affair by word of mouth besid deliv
a written report toward midnight bolkhovtinov have receiv the
dispatch and verbal instruct gallop off to the gener staff
accompani by a cossack with spare hors
chapter xvi
it wa a warm dark autumn night it had been rain for four dai
have chang hors twice and gallop twenti mile in an hour and a
half over a sticki muddi road bolkhovtinov reach litashvka after
on oclock at night dismount at a cottag on whose wattl fenc
hung a signboard gener staff and throw down hi rein he enter
a dark passag
the gener on duti quick it veri import said he to someon
who had risen and wa snif in the dark passag
he ha been veri unwel sinc the even and thi is the third night
he ha not slept said the orderli pleadingli in a whisper you should
wake the captain first
but thi is veri import from gener dokhtrov said
bolkhovtinov enter the open door which he had found by feel in
the dark
the orderli had gone in befor him and began wake somebodi
your honor your honor a courier
what what that from whom came a sleepi voic
from dokhtrov and from alexi petrvich napoleon is at formnsk
said bolkhovtinov unabl to see in the dark who wa speak but
guess by the voic that it wa not konovntsyn
the man who had waken yawn and stretch himself
i dont like wake him he said fumbl for someth he is veri
ill perhap thi is onli a rumor
here is the dispatch said bolkhovtinov my order ar to give it at
onc to the gener on duti
wait a moment ill light a candl you damn rascal where do you
alwai hide it said the voic of the man who wa stretch himself
to the orderli thi wa shcherbnin konovntsyn adjut iv
found it iv found it he ad
the orderli wa strike a light and shcherbnin wa fumbl for
someth on the candlestick
oh the nasti beast said he with disgust
by the light of the spark bolkhovtinov saw shcherbnin youth face
as he held the candl and the face of anoth man who wa still asleep
thi wa konovntsyn
when the flame of the sulphur splinter kindl by the tinder burn
up first blue and then red shcherbnin lit the tallow candl from
the candlestick of which the cockroach that had been gnaw it were
run awai and look at the messeng bolkhovtinov wa bespatt
all over with mud and had smear hi face by wipe it with hi sleev
who gave the report inquir shcherbnin take the envelop
the new is reliabl said bolkhovtinov prison cossack and
the scout all sai the same thing
there noth to be done well have to wake him said shcherbnin
rise and go up to the man in the nightcap who lai cover by a
greatcoat peter petrvich said he konovntsyn did not stir to
the gener staff he said with a smile know that those word would
be sure to arous him
and in fact the head in the nightcap wa lift at onc on
konovntsyn handsom resolut face with cheek flush by fever
there still remain for an instant a farawai dreami express remot
from present affair but then he suddenli start and hi face assum
it habitu calm and firm appear
well what is it from whom he ask immedi but without hurri
blink at the light
while listen to the offic report konovntsyn broke the seal and
read the dispatch hardli had he done so befor he lower hi leg in
their woolen stock to the earthen floor and began put on hi
boot then he took off hi nightcap comb hi hair over hi templ
and don hi cap
did you get here quickli let us go to hi high
konovntsyn had understood at onc that the new brought wa of great
import and that no time must be lost he did not consid or ask
himself whether the new wa good or bad that did not interest him he
regard the whole busi of the war not with hi intellig or hi
reason but by someth els there wa within him a deep unexpress
convict that all would be well but that on must not trust to thi
and still less speak about it but must onli attend to on own work
and he did hi work give hi whole strength to the task
peter petrvich konovntsyn like dokhtrov seem to have been includ
mere for proprieti sake in the list of the socal hero of
1812the barclai ravski ermlov pltov and milordovich like
dokhtrov he had the reput of be a man of veri limit capac
and inform and like dokhtrov he never made plan of battl but
wa alwai found where the situat wa most difficult sinc hi
appoint as gener on duti he had alwai slept with hi door open
give order that everi messeng should be allow to wake him up in
battl he wa alwai under fire so that kutzov reprov him for it and
fear to send him to the front and like dokhtrov he wa on of those
unnot cogwheel that without clatter or nois constitut the most
essenti part of the machin
come out of the hut into the damp dark night konovntsyn
frownedpartli from an increas pain in hi head and partli at the
unpleas thought that occur to him of how all that nest of
influenti men on the staff would be stir up by thi new
especi bennigsen who ever sinc tartino had been at dagger
drawn with kutzov and how thei would make suggest quarrel issu
order and rescind them and thi premonit wa disagre to him
though he knew it could not be help
and in fact toll to whom he went to commun the new immedi
began to expound hi plan to a gener share hi quarter until
konovntsyn who listen in weari silenc remind him that thei must
go to see hi high
chapter xvii
kutzov like all old peopl did not sleep much at night he often fell
asleep unexpectedli in the daytim but at night ly on hi bed
without undress he gener remain awak think
so he lai now on hi bed support hi larg heavi scar head on
hi plump hand with hi on ey open medit and peer into the
dark
sinc bennigsen who correspond with the emperor and had more
influenc than anyon els on the staff had begun to avoid him kutzov
wa more at eas as to the possibl of himself and hi troop be
oblig to take part in useless aggress movement the lesson of the
tartino battl and of the dai befor it which kutzov rememb with
pain must he thought have some effect on other too
thei must understand that we can onli lose by take the offens
patienc and time ar my warrior my champion thought kutzov he
knew that an appl should not be pluck while it is green it will fall
of itself when ripe but if pick unrip the appl is spoil the tree
is harm and your teeth ar set on edg like an experienc sportsman
he knew that the beast wa wound and wound as onli the whole
strength of russia could have wound it but whether it wa mortal
wound or not wa still an undecid question now by the fact of
lauriston and barthlemi have been sent and by the report of the
guerrilla kutzov wa almost sure that the wound wa mortal but he
need further proof and it wa necessari to wait
thei want to run to see how thei have wound it wait and we shall
see continu maneuv continu advanc thought he what for
onli to distinguish themselv as if fight were fun thei ar
like children from whom on cant get ani sensibl account of what ha
happen becaus thei all want to show how well thei can fight but
that not what is need now
and what ingeni maneuv thei all propos to me it seem to
them that when thei have thought of two or three conting he
rememb the gener plan sent him from petersburg thei have
foreseen everyth but the conting ar endless
the undecid question as to whether the wound inflict at borodin wa
mortal or not had hung over kutzov head for a whole month on the on
hand the french had occupi moscow on the other kutzov felt assur
with all hi be that the terribl blow into which he and all the
russian had put their whole strength must have been mortal but in ani
case proof were need he had wait a whole month for them and grew
more impati the longer he wait ly on hi bed dure those
sleepless night he did just what he reproach those younger gener
for do he imagin all sort of possibl conting just like
the younger men but with thi differ that he saw thousand of
conting instead of two or three and base noth on them the
longer he thought the more conting present themselv he
imagin all sort of movement of the napoleon armi as a whole or
in sectionsagainst petersburg or against him or to outflank him
he thought too of the possibl which he fear most of all that
napoleon might fight him with hi own weapon and remain in moscow
await him kutzov even imagin that napoleon armi might turn back
through medn and yukhnv but the on thing he could not forese wa
what happenedth insan convuls stamped of napoleon armi dure
it first eleven dai after leav moscow a stamped which made
possibl what kutzov had not yet even dare to think ofth complet
extermin of the french drokhov report about broussier
divis the guerrilla report of distress in napoleon armi rumor
of prepar for leav moscow all confirm the supposit that
the french armi wa beaten and prepar for flight but these were
onli supposit which seem import to the younger men but not to
kutzov with hi sixti year experi he knew what valu to attach
to rumor knew how apt peopl who desir anyth ar to group all new
so that it appear to confirm what thei desir and he knew how readili
in such case thei omit all that make for the contrari and the more
he desir it the less he allow himself to believ it thi question
absorb all hi mental power all els wa to him onli life
customari routin to such customari routin belong hi convers
with the staff the letter he wrote from tartino to madam de stal
the read of novel the distribut of award hi correspond
with petersburg and so on but the destruct of the french which he
alon foresaw wa hi heart on desir
on the night of the eleventh of octob he lai lean on hi arm and
think of that
there wa a stir in the next room and he heard the step of toll
konovntsyn and bolkhovtinov
eh who there come in come in what new the field marshal call
out to them
while a footman wa light a candl toll commun the substanc
of the new
who brought it ask kutzov with a look which when the candl wa
lit struck toll by it cold sever
there can be no doubt about it your high
call him in call him here
kutzov sat up with on leg hang down from the bed and hi big paunch
rest against the other which wa doubl under him he screw up hi
see ey to scrutin the messeng more carefulli as if wish to
read in hi face what preoccupi hi own mind
tell me tell me friend said he to bolkhovtinov in hi low ag
voic as he pull togeth the shirt which gape open on hi chest
come nearernear what new have you brought me eh that napoleon
ha left moscow ar you sure eh
bolkhovtinov gave a detail account from the begin of all he had
been told to report
speak quicker quicker dont tortur me kutzov interrupt him
bolkhovtinov told him everyth and wa then silent await
instruct toll wa begin to sai someth but kutzov check
him he tri to sai someth but hi face suddenli pucker and
wrinkl he wave hi arm at toll and turn to the opposit side of
the room to the corner darken by the icon that hung there
o lord my creator thou ha heard our prayer said he in a
tremul voic with fold hand russia is save i thank thee o
lord and he wept
chapter xviii
from the time he receiv thi new to the end of the campaign all
kutzov activ wa direct toward restrain hi troop by
author by guil and by entreati from useless attack
maneuv or encount with the perish enemi dokhtrov went to
mloyaroslvet but kutzov linger with the main armi and gave
order for the evacu of kalgaa retreat beyond which town seem
to him quit possibl
everywher kutzov retreat but the enemi without wait for hi
retreat fled in the opposit direct
napoleon historian describ to us hi skill maneuv at tartino
and mloyaroslvet and make conjectur as to what would have
happen had napoleon been in time to penetr into the rich southern
provinc
but not to speak of the fact that noth prevent him from advanc
into those southern provinc for the russian armi did not bar hi
wai the historian forget that noth could have save hi armi for
then alreadi it bore within itself the germ of inevit ruin how
could that armywhich had found abund suppli in moscow and had
trampl them underfoot instead of keep them and on arriv at
smolnsk had loot provis instead of store themhow could that
armi recuper in kalga provinc which wa inhabit by russian such
as those who live in moscow and where fire had the same properti of
consum what wa set ablaz
that armi could not recov anywher sinc the battl of borodin
and the pillag of moscow it had born within itself as it were the
chemic element of dissolut
the member of what had onc been an armynapoleon himself and all hi
soldiersfl without know whither each concern onli to make hi
escap as quickli as possibl from thi posit of the hopeless of
which thei were all more or less vagu consciou
so it came about that at the council at mloyaroslvet when the
gener pretend to confer togeth express variou opinion all
mouth were close by the opinion utter by the simplemind soldier
mouton who speak last said what thei all felt that the on thing
need wa to get awai as quickli as possibl and no on not
even napoleon could sai anyth against that truth which thei all
recogn
but though thei all realiz that it wa necessari to get awai there
still remain a feel of shame at admit that thei must flee an
extern shock wa need to overcom that shame and thi shock came in
due time it wa what the french call le hourra de lempereur
the dai after the council at mloyaroslvet napoleon rode out earli in
the morn amid the line of hi armi with hi suit of marshal and
an escort on the pretext of inspect the armi and the scene of the
previou and of the impend battl some cossack on the prowl for
booti fell in with the emperor and veri nearli captur him if the
cossack did not captur napoleon then what save him wa the veri
thing that wa destroi the french armi the booti on which the
cossack fell here as at tartino thei went after plunder leav the
men disregard napoleon thei rush after the plunder and napoleon
manag to escap
when le enfant du don might so easili have taken the emperor himself
in the midst of hi armi it wa clear that there wa noth for it but
to fly as fast as possibl along the nearest familiar road napoleon
with hi fortyyearold stomach understood that hint not feel hi
former agil and bold and under the influenc of the fright
the cossack had given him he at onc agre with mouton and issu
ordersa the historian tell usto retreat by the smolnsk road
that napoleon agre with mouton and that the armi retreat doe
not prove that napoleon caus it to retreat but that the forc which
influenc the whole armi and direct it along the mozhysk that is
the smolnsk road act simultan on him also
chapter xix
a man in motion alwai devis an aim for that motion to be abl to go
a thousand mile he must imagin that someth good await him at the
end of those thousand mile on must have the prospect of a promis
land to have the strength to move
the promis land for the french dure their advanc had been moscow
dure their retreat it wa their nativ land but that nativ land
wa too far off and for a man go a thousand mile it is absolut
necessari to set asid hi final goal and to sai to himself todai i
shall get to a place twentyf mile off where i shall rest and
spend the night and dure the first dai journei that rest place
eclips hi ultim goal and attract all hi hope and desir and
the impuls felt by a singl person ar alwai magnifi in a crowd
for the french retreat along the old smolnsk road the final
goaltheir nativ landwa too remot and their immedi goal
wa smolnsk toward which all their desir and hope enorm
intensifi in the mass urg them on it wa not that thei knew that
much food and fresh troop await them in smolnsk nor that thei were
told so on the contrari their superior offic and napoleon himself
knew that provis were scarc there but becaus thi alon could
give them strength to move on and endur their present privat so
both those who knew and those who did not know deceiv themselv and
push on to smolnsk as to a promis land
come out onto the highroad the french fled with surpris energi
and unheardof rapid toward the goal thei had fix on besid the
common impuls which bound the whole crowd of french into on mass and
suppli them with a certain energi there wa anoth caus bind
them togethertheir great number as with the physic law of graviti
their enorm mass drew the individu human atom to itself in their

of thi common attract to smolnsk their goal drew each of them in
the same direct on the other hand an armi corp could not surrend
to a compani and though the french avail themselv of everi
conveni opportun to detach themselv and to surrend on the
slightest decent pretext such pretext did not alwai occur their
veri number and their crowd and swift movement depriv them of that

chapter i
the battl of borodin with the occup of moscow that follow it
and the flight of the french without further conflict is on of the
most instruct phenomena in histori
all historian agre that the extern activ of state and nation
in their conflict with on anoth is express in war and that as a
direct result of greater or less success in war the polit strength
of state and nation increas or decreas
strang as mai be the histor account of how some king or emperor
have quarrel with anoth collect an armi fight hi enemi
armi gain a victori by kill three five or ten thousand men and
subjug a kingdom and an entir nation of sever million all
the fact of histori as far as we know it confirm the truth of the
statement that the greater or lesser success of on armi against anoth
is the caus or at least an essenti indic of an increas or
decreas in the strength of the nationeven though it is unintellig
why the defeat of an armya hundredth part of a nationshould oblig
that whole nation to submit an armi gain a victori and at onc the
right of the conquer nation have increas to the detriment of the
defeat an armi ha suffer defeat and at onc a peopl lose it
right in proport to the sever of the revers and if it armi
suffer a complet defeat the nation is quit subjug
so accord to histori it ha been found from the most ancient time
and so it is to our own dai all napoleon war serv to confirm thi
rule in proport to the defeat of the austrian armi austria lose
it right and the right and the strength of franc increas the
victori of the french at jena and auerstdt destroi the independ
exist of prussia
but then in 1812 the french gain a victori near moscow moscow is
taken and after that with no further battl it is not russia that
ceas to exist but the french armi of six hundr thousand and
then napoleon franc itself to strain the fact to fit the rule of
histori to sai that the field of battl at borodin remain in the
hand of the russian or that after moscow there were other battl
that destroi napoleon armi is imposs
after the french victori at borodin there wa no gener engag nor
ani that were at all seriou yet the french armi ceas to exist what
doe thi mean if it were an exampl taken from the histori of china
we might sai that it wa not an histor phenomenon which is the
historian usual expedi when anyth doe not fit their standard
if the matter concern some brief conflict in which onli a small number
of troop took part we might treat it as an except but thi event
occur befor our father ey and for them it wa a question of the
life or death of their fatherland and it happen in the greatest of
all known war
the period of the campaign of 1812 from the battl of borodin to the
expuls of the french prove that the win of a battl doe not
produc a conquest and is not even an invari indic of conquest
it prove that the forc which decid the fate of peopl li not in
the conqueror nor even in armi and battl but in someth els
the french historian describ the condit of the french armi
befor it left moscow affirm that all wa in order in the grand armi
except the cavalri the artilleri and the transportther wa no forag
for the hors or the cattl that wa a misfortun no on could remedi
for the peasant of the district burn their hai rather than let the
french have it
the victori gain did not bring the usual result becaus the peasant
karp and vla who after the french had evacu moscow drove in their
cart to pillag the town and in gener person fail to manifest
ani heroic feel and the whole innumer multitud of such
peasant did not bring their hai to moscow for the high price offer
them but burn it instead
let us imagin two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapier
accord to all the rule of the art of fenc the fenc ha
gone on for some time suddenli on of the combat feel himself
wound and understand that the matter is no joke but concern hi
life throw down hi rapier and seiz the first cudgel that come to
hand begin to brandish it then let us imagin that the combat who
so sensibl emploi the best and simplest mean to attain hi end wa
at the same time influenc by tradit of chivalri and desir to
conceal the fact of the case insist that he had gain hi victori
with the rapier accord to all the rule of art on can imagin what
confus and obscur would result from such an account of the duel
the fencer who demand a contest accord to the rule of fenc wa
the french armi hi oppon who threw awai the rapier and snatch up
the cudgel wa the russian peopl those who try to explain the matter
accord to the rule of fenc ar the historian who have describ
the event
after the burn of smolnsk a war began which did not follow ani
previou tradit of war the burn of town and villag the
retreat after battl the blow dealt at borodin and the renew
retreat the burn of moscow the captur of maraud the seizur of
transport and the guerrilla war were all departur from the rule
napoleon felt thi and from the time he took up the correct fenc
attitud in moscow and instead of hi oppon rapier saw a cudgel
rais abov hi head he did not ceas to complain to kutzov and to
the emperor alexand that the war wa be carri on contrari to all
the rulesa if there were ani rule for kill peopl in spite of the
complaint of the french as to the nonobserv of the rule in
spite of the fact that to some highli place russian it seem rather
disgrac to fight with a cudgel and thei want to assum a pose en
quart or en tierc accord to all the rule and to make an adroit
thrust en prime and so onth cudgel of the peopl war wa lift
with all it menac and majest strength and without consult
anyon tast or rule and regardless of anyth els it rose and
fell with stupid simplic but consist and belabor the french
till the whole invas had perish
and it is well for a peopl who do nota the french did in 1813salut
accord to all the rule of art and present the hilt of their
rapier gracefulli and polit hand it to their magnanim conqueror
but at the moment of trial without ask what rule other have
adopt in similar case simpli and easili pick up the first cudgel
that come to hand and strike with it till the feel of resent and
reveng in their soul yield to a feel of contempt and compass
chapter ii
on of the most obviou and advantag departur from the socal
law of war is the action of scatter group against men press
togeth in a mass such action alwai occur in war that take on a
nation charact in such action instead of two crowd oppos
each other the men dispers attack singli run awai when attack by
stronger forc but again attack when opportun offer thi wa done
by the guerrilla in spain by the mountain tribe in the caucasu and
by the russian in 1812
peopl have call thi kind of war guerrilla warfar and assum that
by so call it thei have explain it mean but such a war doe
not fit in under ani rule and is directli oppos to a wellknown rule
of tactic which is accept as infal that rule sai that an
attack should concentr hi forc in order to be stronger than hi
oppon at the moment of conflict
guerrilla war alwai success as histori show directli infring
that rule
thi contradict aris from the fact that militari scienc assum
the strength of an armi to be ident with it number militari
scienc sai that the more troop the greater the strength le gro
bataillon ont toujour raison
larg battalion ar alwai victori
for militari scienc to sai thi is like defin momentum in mechan
by refer to the mass onli state that momenta ar equal or unequ
to each other simpli becaus the mass involv ar equal or unequ
momentum quantiti of motion is the product of mass and veloc
in militari affair the strength of an armi is the product of it mass
and some unknown x
militari scienc see in histori innumer instanc of the fact
that the size of ani armi doe not coincid with it strength and that
small detach defeat larger on obscur admit the exist
of thi unknown factor and tri to discov itnow in a geometr
format now in the equip emploi now and most usual in the
geniu of the command but the assign of these variou mean
to the factor doe not yield result which accord with the histor
fact
yet it is onli necessari to abandon the fals view adopt to gratifi
the hero of the efficaci of the direct issu in wartim by
command in order to find thi unknown quantiti
that unknown quantiti is the spirit of the armi that is to sai the
greater or lesser readi to fight and face danger felt by all the men
compos an armi quit independ of whether thei ar or ar not
fight under the command of a geniu in twoor threelin format
with cudgel or with rifl that repeat thirti time a minut men
who want to fight will alwai put themselv in the most advantag
condit for fight
the spirit of an armi is the factor which multipli by the mass give
the result forc to defin and express the signific of thi
unknown factorth spirit of an armyi a problem for scienc
thi problem is onli solvabl if we ceas arbitrarili to substitut
for the unknown x itself the condit under which that forc becom
apparentsuch as the command of the gener the equip emploi
and so onmistak these for the real signific of the factor
and if we recogn thi unknown quantiti in it entireti as be
the greater or lesser desir to fight and to face danger onli then
express known histor fact by equat and compar the rel
signific of thi factor can we hope to defin the unknown
ten men battalion or divis fight fifteen men battalion or
divis conquerthat is kill or take captiveal the other while
themselv lose four so that on the on side four and on the other
fifteen were lost consequ the four were equal to the fifteen and
therefor 4x 15y consequ xy 154 thi equat doe not
give us the valu of the unknown factor but give us a ratio between two
unknown and by bring various select histor unit battl
campaign period of war into such equat a seri of number
could be obtain in which certain law should exist and might be
discov
the tactic rule that an armi should act in mass when attack and
in smaller group in retreat unconsci confirm the truth that the
strength of an armi depend on it spirit to lead men forward under
fire more disciplin obtain onli by movement in mass is need
than is need to resist attack but thi rule which leav out of
account the spirit of the armi continu prove incorrect and is in
particularli strike contrast to the fact when some strong rise or
fall in the spirit of the troop occur as in all nation war
the french retreat in 1812though accord to tactic thei should
have separ into detach to defend themselvescongreg into
a mass becaus the spirit of the armi had so fallen that onli the mass
held the armi togeth the russian on the contrari ought accord
to tactic to have attack in mass but in fact thei split up
into small unit becaus their spirit had so risen that separ
individu without order dealt blow at the french without need
ani compuls to induc them to expos themselv to hardship and
danger
chapter iii
the socal partisan war began with the entri of the french into
smolnsk
befor partisan warfar had been offici recogn by the
govern thousand of enemi straggler maraud and forag had
been destroi by the cossack and the peasant who kill them off
as instinct as dog worri a strai mad dog to death den davdov
with hi russian instinct wa the first to recogn the valu of
thi terribl cudgel which regardless of the rule of militari scienc
destroi the french and to him belong the credit for take the first
step toward regular thi method of warfar
on august 24 davdov first partisan detach wa form and then
other were recogn the further the campaign progress the more
numer these detach becam
the irregular destroi the great armi piecem thei gather the
fallen leav that drop of themselv from that wither treeth
french armyand sometim shook that tree itself by octob when
the french were flee toward smolnsk there were hundr of such
compani of variou size and charact there were some that adopt
all the armi method and had infantri artilleri staff and the
comfort of life other consist sole of cossack cavalri there were
also small scratch group of foot and hors and group of peasant and
landown that remain unknown a sacristan command on parti which
captur sever hundr prison in the cours of a month and there
wa vaslisa the wife of a villag elder who slew hundr of the
french
the partisan warfar flame up most fierc in the latter dai of
octob it first period had pass when the partisan themselv
amaz at their own bold fear everi minut to be surround
and captur by the french and hid in the forest without unsaddl
hardli dare to dismount and alwai expect to be pursu by the end
of octob thi kind of warfar had taken definit shape it had becom
clear to all what could be ventur against the french and what could
not now onli the command of detach with staff and move
accord to rule at a distanc from the french still regard mani
thing as imposs the small band that had start their activ
long befor and had alreadi observ the french close consid
thing possibl which the command of the big detach did not dare
to contempl the cossack and peasant who crept in among the french
now consid everyth possibl
on octob 22 densov who wa on of the irregular wa with hi
group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm sinc earli morn he
and hi parti had been on the move all dai long he had been watch
from the forest that skirt the highroad a larg french convoi of
cavalri baggag and russian prison separ from the rest of the
armi whicha wa learn from spi and prisonerswa move under a
strong escort to smolnsk besid densov and dlokhov who also led
a small parti and move in densov vicin the command of some
larg divis with staff also knew of thi convoi and as densov
express it were sharpen their teeth for it two of the command
of larg partieson a pole and the other a germans invit
to densov almost simultan request him to join up with their
divis to attack the convoi
no bwother i have gwown mustach myself said densov on read
these document and he wrote to the german that despit hi heartfelt
desir to serv under so valiant and renown a gener he had to forgo
that pleasur becaus he wa alreadi under the command of the polish
gener to the polish gener he repli to the same effect inform
him that he wa alreadi under the command of the german
have arrang matter thu densov and dlokhov intend without
report matter to the higher command to attack and seiz that
convoi with their own small forc on octob 22 it wa move from
the villag of miklino to that of shmshevo to the left of the road
between miklino and shmshevo there were larg forest extend in
some place up to the road itself though in other a mile or more back
from it through these forest densov and hi parti rode all dai
sometim keep well back in them and sometim come to the veri
edg but never lose sight of the move french that morn
cossack of densov parti had seiz and carri off into the forest
two wagon load with cavalri saddl which had stuck in the mud not
far from miklino where the forest ran close to the road sinc then
and until even the parti had watch the movement of the french
without attack it wa necessari to let the french reach shmshevo
quietli without alarm them and then after join dlokhov who wa
to come that even to a consult at a watchman hut in the forest
less than a mile from shmshevo to surpris the french at dawn fall
like an avalanch on their head from two side and rout and captur
them all at on blow
in their rear more than a mile from miklino where the forest came
right up to the road six cossack were post to report if ani fresh
column of french should show themselv
beyond shmshevo dlokhov wa to observ the road in the same wai to
find out at what distanc there were other french troop thei reckon
that the convoi had fifteen hundr men densov had two hundr and
dlokhov might have as mani more but the dispar of number did not
deter densov all that he now want to know wa what troop these were
and to learn that he had to captur a tonguethat is a man from
the enemi column that morn attack on the wagon had been made so
hastili that the frenchmen with the wagon had all been kill onli a
littl drummer boi had been taken aliv and as he wa a straggler he
could tell them noth definit about the troop in that column
densov consid it danger to make a second attack for fear of
put the whole column on the alert so he sent tkhon shcherbti a
peasant of hi parti to shmshevo to try and seiz at least on of the
french quartermast who had been sent on in advanc
chapter iv
it wa a warm raini autumn dai the sky and the horizon were both
the color of muddi water at time a sort of mist descend and then
suddenli heavi slant rain came down
densov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down
wa ride a thin thoroughbr hors with sunken side like hi hors
which turn it head and laid it ear back he shrank from the drive
rain and gaze anxious befor him hi thin face with it short thick
black beard look angri

palefac fairhair with narrow light ey and with calm
selfsatisfact in hi face and bear though it wa imposs to
sai in what the peculiar of the hors and rider lai yet at first
glanc at the esaul and densov on saw that the latter wa wet and
uncomfort and wa a man mount on a hors while look at the
esaul on saw that he wa as comfort and as much at eas as alwai
and that he wa not a man who had mount a hors but a man who wa on
with hi hors a be consequ possess of twofold strength
a littl ahead of them walk a peasant guid wet to the skin and
wear a grai peasant coat and a white knit cap

densov and ptya rode up to him from the spot where the peasant wa

downward slope lai a field of spring rye to the right beyond a steep
ravin wa a small villag and a landown hous with a broken roof
in the villag in the hous in the garden by the well by the pond
over all the rise ground and all along the road uphil from the
bridg lead to the villag not more than five hundr yard
awai crowd of men could be seen through the shimmer mist their
unrussian shout at their hors which were strain uphil with the
cart and their call to on anoth could be clearli heard
bwing the prison here said densov in a low voic not take hi
ey off the french
a cossack dismount lift the boi down and took him to densov
point to the french troop densov ask him what these and those
of them were the boi thrust hi cold hand into hi pocket and
lift hi eyebrow look at densov in affright but in spite of
an evid desir to sai all he knew gave confus answer mere
assent to everyth densov ask him densov turn awai from him
frown and address the esaul convei hi own conjectur to him
ptya rapidli turn hi head look now at the drummer boi now
at densov now at the esaul and now at the french in the villag and
along the road try not to miss anyth of import
whether dlokhov come or not we must seiz it eh said densov with
a merri sparkl in hi ey
it is a veri suitabl spot said the esaul
well send the infantwi down by the swamp densov continu
theyll cweep up to the garden youll wide up fwom there with the
cossacksh point to a spot in the forest beyond the villageand i
with my hussar fwom here and at the signal shot
the hollow is impassablether a swamp there said the esaul the
hors would sink we must ride round more to the left
while thei were talk in underton the crack of a shot sound
from the low ground by the pond a puff of white smoke appear then
anoth and the sound of hundr of seemingli merri french voic
shout togeth came up from the slope for a moment densov and the
esaul drew back thei were so near that thei thought thei were the caus
of the fire and shout but the fire and shout did not relat
to them down below a man wear someth red wa run through the
marsh the french were evid fire and shout at him
why that our tkhon said the esaul
so it is it is
the wascal said densov
hell get awai said the esaul screw up hi ey
the man whom thei call tkhon have run to the stream plung in
so that the water splash in the air and have disappear for an
instant scrambl out on all four all black with the wet and ran on
the french who had been pursu him stop
smart that said the esaul
what a beast said densov with hi former look of vexat what ha
he been do all thi time
who is he ask ptya
he our plastn i sent him to captur a tongu
oh ye said ptya nod at the first word densov utter as if
he understood it all though he realli did not understand anyth of
it
tkhon shcherbti wa on of the most indispens men in their band
he wa a peasant from pokrvsk near the river gzhat when densov had
come to pokrvsk at the begin of hi oper and had as usual
summon the villag elder and ask him what he knew about the french
the elder as though shield himself had repli as all villag
elder did that he had neither seen nor heard anyth of them but
when densov explain that hi purpos wa to kill the french and
ask if no french had strai that wai the elder repli that some
moreorder had realli been at their villag but that tkhon
shcherbti wa the onli man who dealt with such matter densov had
tkhon call and have prais him for hi activ said a few word
in the elder presenc about loyalti to the tsar and the countri and
the hatr of the french that all son of the fatherland should cherish
we dont do the french ani harm said tkhon evid frighten by
densov word we onli fool about with the lad for fun you know
we kill a score or so of moreorder but we did no harm els
next dai when densov had left pokrvsk have quit forgotten about
thi peasant it wa report to him that tkhon had attach himself
to their parti and ask to be allow to remain with it densov gave
order to let him do so
tkhon who at first did rough work lai campfir fetch water
flai dead hors and so on soon show a great like and aptitud
for partisan warfar at night he would go out for booti and alwai
brought back french cloth and weapon and when told to would bring
in french captiv also densov then reliev him from drudgeri and
began take him with him when he went out on expedit and had him
enrol among the cossack
tkhon did not like ride and alwai went on foot never lag
behind the cavalri he wa arm with a musketoon which he carri
rather as a joke a pike and an ax which latter he us as a wolf us
it teeth with equal eas pick flea out of it fur or crunch
thick bone tkhon with equal accuraci would split log with blow at
arm length or hold the head of the ax would cut thin littl peg

confus when densov ask him whether he could stai befor thei had
ridden to the outskirt of the forest ptya had consid he must carri
out hi instruct strictli and return at onc but when he saw the
french and saw tkhon and learn that there would certainli be an

chang their view that the gener whom he had greatli respect till
then wa a rubbishi german that densov wa a hero the esaul a hero
and tkhon a hero too and that it would be shame for him to leav

to whom densov had had some mutton and vodka given and whom he had had
dress in a russian coat so that he might be kept with their band and
not sent awai with the other prison ptya had heard in the armi mani
stori of dlokhov extraordinari braveri and of hi cruelti to the
french so from the moment he enter the hut ptya did not take hi
ey from him but brace himself up more and more and held hi head
high that he might not be unworthi even of such compani
dlokhov appear amaz ptya by it simplic
densov wore a cossack coat had a beard had an icon of nichola the
wonderwork on hi breast and hi wai of speak and everyth he
did indic hi unusu posit but dlokhov who in moscow had worn

an order of st georg at hi buttonhol and a plain forag cap set
straight on hi head he took off hi wet felt cloak in a corner of

question him about the matter in hand densov told him of the
design the larg detach had on the transport of the messag ptya

on my conscienc would it be difficult for you to send thirti or
thwee hundw men to town under escort instead of stainingi speak

had no time to grasp fulli what thei were talk about if grownup
distinguish men think so it must be necessari and right thought he
but abov all densov must not dare to imagin that ill obei him and

watchman hut or it might be a cavern lead to the veri depth of
the earth perhap the red spot wa a fire or it might be the ey of an
enorm monster perhap he wa realli sit on a wagon but it might
veri well be that he wa not sit on a wagon but on a terribl high
tower from which if he fell he would have to fall for a whole dai or a
whole month or go on fall and never reach the bottom perhap it
wa just the cossack likhachv who wa sit under the wagon but it
might be the kindest bravest most wonder most splendid man in the
world whom no on knew of it might realli have been that the hussar
came for water and went back into the hollow but perhap he had simpli
vanisheddisappear altogeth and dissolv into nothing
noth ptya could have seen now would have surpris him he wa in a
fairi kingdom where everyth wa possibl
he look up at the sky and the sky wa a fairi realm like the earth
it wa clear and over the top of the tree cloud were swiftli
sail as if unveil the star sometim it look as if the cloud
were pass and a clear black sky appear sometim it seem as

the tree were drip quiet talk wa heard the hors neigh and
jostl on anoth someon snore
ozhegzheg ozhegzheg hiss the saber against the whetston
and suddenli ptya heard an harmoni orchestra plai some unknown
sweetli solemn hymn ptya wa as music as natsha and more so than
nichola but had never learn music or thought about it and so the
melodi that unexpectedli came to hi mind seem to him particularli
fresh and attract the music becam more and more audibl the melodi
grew and pass from on instrument to anoth and what wa plai wa
a fuguethough ptya had not the least concept of what a fugu is
each instrumentnow resembl a violin and now a horn but better
and clearer than violin or hornplai it own part and befor it had
finish the melodi merg with anoth instrument that began almost the
same air and then with a third and a fourth and thei all blend into
on and again becam separ and again blend now into solemn church
music now into someth dazzlingli brilliant and triumphant
ohwhi that wa in a dream ptya said to himself as he lurch
forward it in my ear but perhap it music of my own well go
on my music now
he close hi ey and from all side as if from a distanc sound
flutter grew into harmoni separ blend and again all
mingl into the same sweet and solemn hymn oh thi is delight
as much as i like and as i like said ptya to himself he tri to
conduct that enorm orchestra
now softli softli die awai and the sound obei him now fuller
more joy still more and more joy and from an unknown depth rose
increasingli triumphant sound now voic join in order ptya and
at first from afar he heard men voic and then women the voic
grew in harmoni triumphant strength and ptya listen to their
surpass beauti in aw and joi
with a solemn triumphal march there mingl a song the drip from the
tree and the hiss of the saber ozhegzhegzheg and again the
hors jostl on anoth and neigh not disturb the choir but

chapter xii
dure the whole of their march from moscow no fresh order had been
issu by the french author concern the parti of prison
among whom wa pierr on the twentysecond of octob that parti wa
no longer with the same troop and baggag train with which it had left
moscow half the wagon laden with hardtack that had travel the first
stage with them had been captur by cossack the other half had gone
on ahead not on of those dismount cavalrymen who had march in
front of the prison wa left thei had all disappear the artilleri
the prison had seen in front of them dure the first dai wa
now replac by marshal junot enorm baggag train convoi by
westphalian behind the prison came a cavalri baggag train
from vyzma onward the french armi which had till then move in three
column went on as a singl group the symptom of disord that pierr
had notic at their first halt place after leav moscow had now
reach the utmost limit
the road along which thei move wa border on both side by dead
hors rag men who had fallen behind from variou regiment
continu chang about now join the move column now again
lag behind it
sever time dure the march fals alarm had been given and the
soldier of the escort had rais their musket fire and run
headlong crush on anoth but had afterward reassembl and
abus each other for their causeless panic
these three group travel togetherth cavalri store the convoi of
prison and junot baggag trainstil constitut a separ and
unit whole though each of the group wa rapidli melt awai
of the artilleri baggag train which had consist of a hundr and
twenti wagon not more than sixti now remain the rest had been
captur or left behind some of junot wagon also had been captur
or abandon three wagon had been raid and rob by straggler
from davout corp from the talk of the german pierr learn that
a larger guard had been allot to that baggag train than to the
prison and that on of their comrad a german soldier had been
shot by the marshal own order becaus a silver spoon belong to the
marshal had been found in hi possess
the group of prison had melt awai most of all of the three hundr
and thirti men who had set out from moscow fewer than a hundr now
remain the prison were more burdensom to the escort than even the
cavalri saddl or junot baggag thei understood that the saddl and
junot spoon might be of some us but that cold and hungri soldier
should have to stand and guard equal cold and hungri russian who
froze and lag behind on the road in which case the order wa to
shoot them wa not mere incomprehens but revolt and the
escort as if afraid in the grievou condit thei themselv were in
of give wai to the piti thei felt for the prison and so render
their own plight still wors treat them with particular moros
and sever
at dorogobzh while the soldier of the convoi after lock the
prison in a stabl had gone off to pillag their own store sever
of the soldier prison tunnel under the wall and ran awai but were
recaptur by the french and shot
the arrang adopt when thei start that the offic prison
should be kept separ from the rest had long sinc been abandon
all who could walk went togeth and after the third stage pierr had
rejoin karatev and the grayblu bandyleg dog that had chosen
karatev for it master
on the third dai after leav moscow karatev again fell ill with the
fever he had suffer from in the hospit in moscow and as he grew
gradual weaker pierr kept awai from him pierr did not know why but
sinc karatev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to
go near him when he did so and heard the subdu moan with which
karatev gener lai down at the halt place and when he smell
the odor eman from him which wa now stronger than befor pierr
move farther awai and did not think about him
while imprison in the shed pierr had learn not with hi intellect
but with hi whole be by life itself that man is creat for
happi that happi is within him in the satisfact of simpl
human need and that all unhappi aris not from privat but from
superflu and now dure these last three week of the march he had
learn still anoth new consolatori truththat noth in thi world
is terribl he had learn that as there is no condit in which man
can be happi and entir free so there is no condit in which he
need be unhappi and lack freedom he learn that suffer and freedom
have their limit and that those limit ar veri near togeth that the
person in a bed of rose with on crumpl petal suffer as keenli as
he now sleep on the bare damp earth with on side grow chill
while the other wa warm and that when he had put on tight danc
shoe he had suffer just as he did now when he walk with bare feet
that were cover with soreshi footgear have long sinc fallen to
piec he discov that when he had marri hi wifeof hi own free
will as it had seem to himh had been no more free than now when thei
lock him up at night in a stabl of all that he himself subsequ
term hi suffer but which at the time he scarc felt the worst
wa the state of hi bare raw and scabcov feet the horseflesh
wa appet and nourish the saltpet flavor of the gunpowd
thei us instead of salt wa even pleasant there wa no great cold
it wa alwai warm walk in the daytim and at night there were the
campfir the lice that devour him warm hi bodi the on thing
that wa at first hard to bear wa hi feet
after the second dai march pierr have examin hi feet by the
campfir thought it would be imposs to walk on them but when
everybodi got up he went along limp and when he had warm up
walk without feel the pain though at night hi feet were more
terribl to look at than befor howev he did not look at them now
but thought of other thing
onli now did pierr realiz the full strength of life in man and the
save power he ha of transfer hi attent from on thing
to anoth which is like the safeti valv of a boiler that allow
superflu steam to blow off when the pressur exce a certain limit
he did not see and did not hear how thei shot the prison who lag
behind though more than a hundr perish in that wai he did not
think of karatev who grew weaker everi dai and evid would soon
have to share that fate still less did pierr think about himself the
harder hi posit becam and the more terribl the futur the more
independ of that posit in which he found himself were the joy
and comfort thought memori and imagin that came to him
chapter xiii

chapter xvi
after the twentyeighth of octob when the frost began the flight of
the french assum a still more tragic charact with men freez
or roast themselv to death at the campfir while carriag
with peopl dress in fur continu to drive past carri awai the
properti that had been stolen by the emperor king and duke but
the process of the flight and disintegr of the french armi went on
essenti as befor
from moscow to vyzma the french armi of seventythre thousand men not
reckon the guard who did noth dure the whole war but pillag
wa reduc to thirtysix thousand though not more than five thousand
had fallen in battl from thi begin the succeed term of the
progress could be determin mathemat the french armi melt
awai and perish at the same rate from moscow to vyzma from vyzma
to smolnsk from smolnsk to the berzina and from the berzina to
vlnaindepend of the greater or lesser intens of the cold the
pursuit the bar of the wai or ani other particular condit
beyond vyzma the french armi instead of move in three column huddl
togeth into on mass and so went on to the end berthier wrote to hi
emperor we know how far command offic allow themselv to diverg
from the truth in describ the condit of an armi and thi is what
he said
i deem it my duti to report to your majesti the condit of the variou
corp i have had occas to observ dure differ stage of the last
two or three dai march thei ar almost disband scarc a quarter
of the soldier remain with the standard of their regiment the other
go off by themselv in differ direct hope to find food and
escap disciplin in gener thei regard smolnsk as the place where
thei hope to recov dure the last few dai mani of the men have been
seen to throw awai their cartridg and their arm in such a state
of affair whatev your ultim plan mai be the interest of your
majesti servic demand that the armi should be ralli at smolnsk
and should first of all be freed from ineffect such as dismount
cavalri unnecessari baggag and artilleri materi that is no longer
in proport to the present forc the soldier who ar worn out with
hunger and fatigu need these suppli as well as a few dai rest
mani have di these last dai on the road or at the bivouac thi
state of thing is continu becom wors and make on fear that
unless a prompt remedi is appli the troop will no longer be under
control in case of an engag
novemb 9 twenti mile from smolnsk
after stagger into smolnsk which seem to them a promis land the
french search for food kill on anoth sack their own store
and when everyth had been plunder fled farther
thei all went without know whither or why thei were go still less
did that geniu napoleon know it for no on issu ani order to
him but still he and those about him retain their old habit wrote
command letter report and order of the dai call on anoth
sire mon cousin princ deckmhl roi de napl and so on but these
order and report were onli on paper noth in them wa act upon
for thei could not be carri out and though thei entitl on
anoth majesti high or cousin thei all felt that thei were
miser wretch who had done much evil for which thei had now to
pai and though thei pretend to be concern about the armi each
wa think onli of himself and of how to get awai quickli and save
himself
chapter xvii
the movement of the russian and french armi dure the campaign
from moscow back to the niemen were like those in a game of russian
blindman buff in which two player ar blindfold and on of
them occasion ring a littl bell to inform the catcher of hi
whereabout first he ring hi bell fearlessli but when he get into
a tight place he run awai as quietli as he can and often think to
escap run straight into hi oppon arm
at first while thei were still move along the kalga road napoleon
armi made their presenc known but later when thei reach the
smolnsk road thei ran hold the clapper of their bell tightand often
think thei were escap ran right into the russian
ow to the rapid of the french flight and the russian pursuit
and the consequ exhaust of the hors the chief mean of
approxim ascertain the enemi positionbi cavalri scoutingwa
not avail besid as a result of the frequent and rapid chang of
posit by each armi even what inform wa obtain could not be
deliv in time if new wa receiv on dai that the enemi had been
in a certain posit the dai befor by the third dai when someth
could have been done that armi wa alreadi two dai march farther on
and in quit anoth posit
on armi fled and the other pursu beyond smolnsk there were sever
differ road avail for the french and on would have thought
that dure their stai of four dai thei might have learn where
the enemi wa might have arrang some more advantag plan and
undertaken someth new but after a four dai halt the mob with no
maneuv or plan again began run along the beaten track neither
to the right nor to the left but along the oldth worstroad through

front of them all fled the emperor then the king then the duke the
russian armi expect napoleon to take the road to the right beyond
the dnieperwhich wa the onli reason thing for him to dothemselv
turn to the right and came out onto the highroad at krsnoe and here
as in a game of blindman buff the french ran into our vanguard see
their enemi unexpectedli the french fell into confus and stop
short from the sudden fright but then thei resum their flight
abandon their comrad who were farther behind then for three dai
separ portion of the french armyfirst murat the vicek

russian armi thei abandon on anoth abandon all their heavi
baggag their artilleri and half their men and fled get past the

nei who came last had been busi himself blow up the wall of
smolnsk which were in nobodi wai becaus despit the unfortun
plight of the french or becaus of it thei wish to punish the floor

chapter xviii
thi campaign consist in a flight of the french dure which thei did
all thei could to destroi themselv from the time thei turn onto
the kalga road to the dai their leader fled from the armi none of the
movement of the crowd had ani sens so on might have thought that
regard thi period of the campaign the historian who attribut
the action of the mass to the will of on man would have found it
imposs to make the stori of the retreat fit their theori but
no mountain of book have been written by the historian about thi
campaign and everywher ar describ napoleon arrang the
maneuv and hi profound plan which guid the armi as well as the
militari geniu shown by hi marshal
the retreat from mloyaroslvet when he had a free road into a
wellsuppli district and the parallel road wa open to him along
which kutzov afterward pursu himthi unnecessari retreat along
a devast roadi explain to us as be due to profound
consider similarli profound consider ar given for
hi retreat from smolnsk to orsh then hi heroism at krsnoe is
describ where he is report to have been prepar to accept battl
and take person command and to have walk about with a birch stick
and said
jai assez fait lempereur il est temp de fair le gnral but
nevertheless immedi ran awai again abandon to it fate the
scatter fragment of the armi he left behind
i have act the emperor long enough it is time to act
the gener
then we ar told of the great of soul of the marshal especi
of neya great of soul consist in thi that he made hi wai by
night around through the forest and across the dnieper and escap to
orsh abandon standard artilleri and nine tenth of hi men
and lastli the final departur of the great emperor from hi heroic
armi is present to us by the historian as someth great and
characterist of geniu even that final run awai describ in
ordinari languag as the lowest depth of base which everi child
is taught to be asham ofeven that act find justif in the
historian languag
when it is imposs to stretch the veri elast thread of histor
ratiocin ani farther when action ar clearli contrari to all
that human call right or even just the historian produc a save
concept of great great it seem exclud the standard
of right and wrong for the great man noth is wrong there is no
atroc for which a great man can be blame
cest grand sai the historian and there no longer exist either
good or evil but onli grand and not grand grand is good not
grand is bad grand is the characterist in their concept of some
special anim call hero and napoleon escap home in a warm
fur coat and leav to perish those who were not mere hi comrad
but were in hi opinion men he had brought there feel que cest
grand 2 and hi soul is tranquil
it is great
2 that it is great
du sublim he saw someth sublim in himself au ridicul il ny
a quun pa said he and the whole world for fifti year ha been
repeat sublim grand napolon le grand du sublim au ridicul
il ny a quun pa
from the sublim to the ridicul is but a step
and it occur to no on that to admit a great not commensur with
the standard of right and wrong is mere to admit on own nothing
and immeasur mean
for us with the standard of good and evil given us by christ no human
action ar incommensur and there is no great where simplic
good and truth ar absent
chapter xix
what russian read the account of the last part of the campaign
of 1812 ha not experienc an uncomfort feel of regret
dissatisfact and perplex who ha not ask himself how it is
that the french were not all captur or destroi when our three armi
surround them in superior number when the disord french hungri
and freez surrend in crowd and when as the historian relat
the aim of the russian wa to stop the french to cut them off and
captur them all
how wa it that the russian armi which when numer weaker than the
french had given battl at borodin did not achiev it purpos when it
had surround the french on three side and when it aim wa to captur
them can the french be so enorm superior to us that when we had
surround them with superior forc we could not beat them how could
that happen
histori or what is call by that name repli to these question
sai that thi occur becaus kutzov and tormsov and chichagv and
thi man and that man did not execut such and such maneuv
but why did thei not execut those maneuv and why if thei were
guilti of not carri out a prearrang plan were thei not tri and
punish but even if we admit that kutzov chichagv and other
were the caus of the russian failur it is still incomprehens
why the posit of the russian armi be what it wa at krsnoe and
at the berzina in both case we had superior forc the french armi
with it marshal king and emperor wa not captur if that wa what
the russian aim at
the explan of thi strang fact given by russian militari
historian to the effect that kutzov hinder an attack is unfound
for we know that he could not restrain the troop from attack at
vyzma and tartino
why wa the russian armywhich with inferior forc had withstood the
enemi in full strength at borodindef at krsnoe and the berzina
by the disorgan crowd of the french when it wa numer
superior
if the aim of the russian consist in cut off and captur
napoleon and hi marshalsand that aim wa not mere frustrat but all
attempt to attain it were most shamefulli baffledthen thi last period
of the campaign is quit rightli consid by the french to be a
seri of victori and quit wrongli consid victori by russian
historian
the russian militari historian in so far as thei submit to claim
of logic must admit that conclus and in spite of their lyric
rhapsodi about valor devot and so forth must reluctantli admit
that the french retreat from moscow wa a seri of victori for
napoleon and defeat for kutzov
but put nation vaniti entir asid on feel that such a
conclus involv a contradict sinc the seri of french
victori brought the french complet destruct while the seri
of russian defeat led to the total destruct of their enemi and the
liber of their countri
the sourc of thi contradict li in the fact that the historian
studi the event from the letter of the sovereign and the gener
from memoir report project and so forth have attribut to thi
last period of the war of 1812 an aim that never exist name that of
cut off and captur napoleon with hi marshal and hi armi
there never wa or could have been such an aim for it would have been
senseless and it attain quit imposs
it would have been senseless first becaus napoleon disorgan
armi wa fly from russia with all possibl speed that is to sai wa
do just what everi russian desir so what wa the us of perform
variou oper on the french who were run awai as fast as thei
possibl could
secondli it would have been senseless to block the passag of men whose
whole energi wa direct to flight
thirdli it would have been senseless to sacrific on own troop in
order to destroi the french armi which without extern interfer
wa destroi itself at such a rate that though it path wa not
block it could not carri across the frontier more than it actual
did in decemb name a hundredth part of the origin armi
fourthli it would have been senseless to wish to take captiv the
emperor king and dukeswhos captur would have been in the highest
degre embarrass for the russian as the most adroit diplomatist of
the time joseph de maistr and other recogn still more senseless
would have been the wish to captur armi corp of the french when our
own armi had melt awai to half befor reach krsnoe and a whole
divis would have been need to convoi the corp of prison and
when our men were not alwai get full ration and the prison
alreadi taken were perish of hunger
all the profound plan about cut off and captur napoleon and hi
armi were like the plan of a market garden who when drive out of
hi garden a cow that had trampl down the bed he had plant should
run to the gate and hit the cow on the head the onli thing to be said
in excus of that garden would be that he wa veri angri but not even
that could be said for those who drew up thi project for it wa not
thei who had suffer from the trampl bed
but besid the fact that cut off napoleon with hi armi would have
been senseless it wa imposs
it wa imposs first becausea experi show that a threemil
movement of column on a battlefield never coincid with the plansth
probabl of chichagv kutzov and wittgenstein effect a junction
on time at an appoint place wa so remot as to be tantamount to
imposs as in fact thought kutzov who when he receiv the plan
remark that divers plan over great distanc do not yield the
desir result
secondli it wa imposs becaus to paralyz the momentum with which
napoleon armi wa retir incompar greater forc than the
russian possess would have been requir
thirdli it wa imposs becaus the militari term to cut off ha no
mean on can cut off a slice of bread but not an armi to cut off
an armyto bar it roadi quit imposs for there is alwai plenti
of room to avoid captur and there is the night when noth can be
seen as the militari scientist might convinc themselv by the
exampl of krsnoe and of the berzina it is onli possibl to captur
prison if thei agre to be captur just as it is onli possibl
to catch a swallow if it settl on on hand men can onli be taken
prison if thei surrend accord to the rule of strategi and
tactic as the german did but the french troop quit rightli did not
consid that thi suit them sinc death by hunger and cold await
them in flight or captiv alik
fourthli and chiefli it wa imposs becaus never sinc the world
began ha a war been fought under such condit as those that obtain
in 1812 and the russian armi in it pursuit of the french strain it
strength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroi
itself
dure the movement of the russian armi from tartino to krsnoe it
lost fifti thousand sick or straggler that is a number equal to the
popul of a larg provinci town half the men fell out of the armi
without a battl
and it is of thi period of the campaignwhen the armi lack boot
and sheepskin coat wa short of provis and without vodka and
wa camp out at night for month in the snow with fifteen degre
of frost when there were onli seven or eight hour of daylight and
the rest wa night in which the influenc of disciplin cannot be
maintain when men were taken into that region of death where
disciplin fail not for a few hour onli as in a battl but for
month where thei were everi moment fight death from hunger and
cold when half the armi perish in a singl monthit is of thi period
of the campaign that the historian tell us how milordovich should have
made a flank march to such and such a place tormsov to anoth place
and chichagv should have cross more than kneedeep in snow to
somewher els and how soandso rout and cut off the french and
so on and so on
the russian half of whom di did all that could and should have been
done to attain an end worthi of the nation and thei ar not to blame
becaus other russian sit in warm room propos that thei should
do what wa imposs
all that strang contradict now difficult to understand between the
fact and the histor account onli aris becaus the historian
deal with the matter have written the histori of the beauti word
and sentiment of variou gener and not the histori of the event
to them the word of milordovich seem veri interest and so do their
surmis and the reward thi or that gener receiv but the question
of those fifti thousand men who were left in hospit and in grave
doe not even interest them for it doe not come within the rang of
their investig
yet on need onli discard the studi of the report and gener plan and
consid the movement of those hundr of thousand of men who took a
direct part in the event and all the question that seem insolubl
easili and simpli receiv an immedi and certain solut
the aim of cut off napoleon and hi armi never exist except in
the imagin of a dozen peopl it could not exist becaus it wa
senseless and unattain
the peopl had a singl aim to free their land from invas that aim
wa attain in the first place of itself as the french ran awai
and so it wa onli necessari not to stop their flight secondli it wa
attain by the guerrilla warfar which wa destroi the french and
thirdli by the fact that a larg russian armi wa follow the french
readi to us it strength in case their movement stop
the russian armi had to act like a whip to a run anim and the
experienc driver knew it wa better to hold the whip rais as a
menac than to strike the run anim on the head

when see a dy anim a man feel a sens of horror substanc

mysteri limitless vista that for an instant had open out befor

onli when alon togeth were thei free from such outrag and pain
thei spoke littl even to on anoth and when thei did it wa of veri
unimport matter
both avoid ani allus to the futur to admit the possibl of
a futur seem to them to insult hi memori still more carefulli did
thei avoid anyth relat to him who wa dead it seem to them that

but pure and complet sorrow is as imposs as pure and complet joi
princess mari in her posit as absolut and independ arbit of
her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew wa the first to
be call back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt
for the first fortnight she receiv letter from her relat to
which she had to repli the room in which littl nichola had been put

i am not go anywher natsha repli when thi wa propos to

difficulti refrain from tear of vexat and irrit rather than

after she felt herself desert by princ mari and alon in her grief
natsha spent most of the time in her room by herself sit huddl
up feet and all in the corner of the sofa tear and twist
someth with her slender nervou finger and gaze intent and
fixedli at whatev her ey chanc to fall on thi solitud exhaust

spiritu gaze wa fix

black woolen gown her plait hair neglig twist into a knot wa
crouch feet and all in the corner of her sofa nervous crumpl and
smooth out the end of her sash while she look at a corner of the

she wa gaze where she knew him to be but she could not imagin him
otherwis than as he had been here she now saw him again as he had been

natsha wound heal in that wai she thought her life wa end
but her love for her mother unexpectedli show her that the essenc of

princ andrew last dai had bound princess mari and natsha togeth
thi new sorrow brought them still closer to on anoth princess mari
put off her departur and for three week look after natsha as if
she had been a sick child the last week pass in her mother bedroom

and natsha embrac her began kiss her face and hand make
princess mari feel shy but happi by thi demonstr of her feel
from that dai a tender and passion friendship such as exist onli
between women wa establish between princess mari and natsha thei
were continu kiss and sai tender thing to on anoth and
spent most of their time togeth when on went out the other becam
restless and hasten to rejoin her togeth thei felt more in harmoni
with on anoth than either of them felt with herself when alon a
feel stronger than friendship sprang up between them an exclus
feel of life be possibl onli in each other presenc
sometim thei were silent for hour sometim after thei were alreadi
in bed thei would begin talk and go on till morn thei spoke most
of what wa long past princess mari spoke of her childhood of her

lack of understand had formerli turn awai from that life of
devot submiss and the poetri of christian selfsacrific now
feel herself bound to princess mari by affect learn to love her
past too and to understand a side of life previous incomprehens to

princess mari listen to natsha tale of childhood and earli
youth there also open out a new and hitherto uncomprehend side of
life belief in life and it enjoy
just as befor thei never mention him so as not to lower as thei
thought their exalt feel by word but thi silenc about him had
the effect of make them gradual begin to forget him without be
consciou of it
natsha had grown thin and pale and physic so weak that thei all
talk about her health and thi pleas her but sometim she wa
suddenli overcom by fear not onli of death but of sick weak
and loss of good look and involuntarili she examin her bare arm
carefulli surpris at it thin and in the morn notic her

her that thing must be so and yet it wa dreadfulli sad
on dai she went quickli upstair and found herself out of breath
unconsci she immedi invent a reason for go down and
then test her strength ran upstair again observ the result
anoth time when she call dunysha her voic trembl so she call
againthough she could hear dunysha comingcal her in the deep chest
tone in which she had been wont to sing and listen attent to
herself
she did not know and would not have believ it but beneath the layer
of slime that cover her soul and seem to her impenetr delic
young shoot of grass were alreadi sprout which take root would so
cover with their live verdur the grief that weigh her down that
it would soon no longer be seen or notic the wound had begun to heal

chapter iv
after the encount at vyzma where kutzov had been unabl to hold
back hi troop in their anxieti to overwhelm and cut off the enemi and
so on the farther movement of the flee french and of the russian
who pursu them continu as far as krsnoe without a battl the
flight wa so rapid that the russian armi pursu the french could
not keep up with them cavalri and artilleri hors broke down and the
inform receiv of the movement of the french wa never reliabl
the men in the russian armi were so worn out by thi continu march
at the rate of twentyseven mile a dai that thei could not go ani
faster
to realiz the degre of exhaust of the russian armi it is onli
necessari to grasp clearli the mean of the fact that while not
lose more than five thousand kill and wound after tartino and
less than a hundr prison the russian armi which left that place a
hundr thousand strong reach krsnoe with onli fifti thousand
the rapid of the russian pursuit wa just as destruct to our armi
as the flight of the french wa to their the onli differ wa that
the russian armi move voluntarili with no such threat of destruct
as hung over the french and that the sick frenchmen were left behind
in enemi hand while the sick russian left behind were among their
own peopl the chief caus of the wastag of napoleon armi wa
the rapid of it movement and a convinc proof of thi is the
correspond decreas of the russian armi
kutzov as far as wa in hi power instead of try to check the
movement of the french as wa desir in petersburg and by the russian
armi gener direct hi whole activ here as he had done at
tartino and vyzma to hasten it on while eas the movement of our
armi
but besid thi sinc the exhaust and enorm diminut of the
armi caus by the rapid of the advanc had becom evid anoth
reason for slacken the pace and delai present itself to kutzov
the aim of the russian armi wa to pursu the french the road the
french would take wa unknown and so the closer our troop trod on
their heel the greater distanc thei had to cover onli by follow
at some distanc could on cut across the zigzag path of the french all
the art maneuv suggest by our gener meant fresh movement of
the armi and a lengthen of it march wherea the onli reason
aim wa to shorten those march to that end kutzov activ wa
direct dure the whole campaign from moscow to vlnanot casual or
intermitt but so consist that he never onc deviat from it
kutzov felt and knewnot by reason or scienc but with the whole of
hi russian beingwhat everi russian soldier felt that the french were
beaten that the enemi wa fly and must be driven out but at the
same time he like the soldier realiz all the hardship of thi march
the rapid of which wa unparallel for such a time of the year
but to the gener especi the foreign on in the russian armi
who wish to distinguish themselv to astonish somebodi and for some
reason to captur a king or a dukeit seem that nowwhen ani battl
must be horribl and senselesswa the veri time to fight and conquer
somebodi kutzov mere shrug hi shoulder when on after
anoth thei present project of maneuv to be made with those
soldiersillshod insuffici clad and half starvedwho within a
month and without fight a battl had dwindl to half their number
and who at the best if the flight continu would have to go a greater
distanc than thei had alreadi travers befor thei reach the
frontier
thi long to distinguish themselv to maneuv to overthrow and
to cut off show itself particularli whenev the russian stumbl on
the french armi
so it wa at krsnoe where thei expect to find on of the three
french column and stumbl instead on napoleon himself with sixteen
thousand men despit all kutzov effort to avoid that ruinou
encount and to preserv hi troop the massacr of the broken mob
of french soldier by wornout russian continu at krsnoe for three
dai
toll wrote a disposit the first column will march to so and so
etc and as usual noth happen in accord with the disposit
princ eugn of wrttemberg fire from a hill over the french crowd
that were run past and demand reinforc which did not
arriv the french avoid the russian dispers and hid themselv
in the forest by night make their wai round as best thei could and
continu their flight
milordovich who said he did not want to know anyth about the
commissariat affair of hi detach and could never be found when
he wa wantedthat chevali san peur et san reproch as he style
himselfwho wa fond of parlei with the french sent envoi demand
their surrend wast time and did not do what he wa order to do
knight without fear and without reproach
i give you that column lad he said ride up to the troop and
point out the french to the cavalri
and the cavalri with spur and saber urg on hors that could
scarc move trot with much effort to the column present
to themthat is to sai to a crowd of frenchmen stark with cold
frostbitten and starvingand the column that had been present to
them threw down it arm and surrend as it had long been anxiou to
do
at krsnoe thei took twentysix thousand prison sever hundr
cannon and a stick call a marshal staff and disput as to who
had distinguish himself and were pleas with their achievementthough
thei much regret not have taken napoleon or at least a marshal or
a hero of some sort and reproach on anoth and especi kutzov
for have fail to do so
these men carri awai by their passion were but blind tool of the
most melancholi law of necess but consid themselv hero and
imagin that thei were accomplish a most nobl and honor
deed thei blame kutzov and said that from the veri begin of the
campaign he had prevent their vanquish napoleon that he thought of
noth but satisfi hi passion and would not advanc from the linen
factori becaus he wa comfort there that at krsnoe he check
the advanc becaus on learn that napoleon wa there he had quit
lost hi head and that it wa probabl that he had an understand
with napoleon and had been bribe by him and so on and so on
not onli did hi contemporari carri awai by their passion talk
in thi wai but poster and histori have acclaim napoleon as grand
while kutzov is describ by foreign as a crafti dissolut weak
old courtier and by russian as someth indefinitea sort of puppet
us onli becaus he had a russian name
chapter v
in 1812 and 1813 kutzov wa openli accus of blunder the emperor
wa dissatisfi with him and in a histori recent written by order
of the highest author it is said that kutzov wa a cun court
liar frighten of the name of napoleon and that by hi blunder at
krsnoe and the berzina he depriv the russian armi of the glori of
complet victori over the french
histori of the year 1812 the charact of kutzov and
reflect on the unsatisfactori result of the battl at
krsnoe by bogdnovich
such is the fate not of great men grand homm whom the russian mind
doe not acknowledg but of those rare and alwai solitari individu
who discern the will of provid submit their person will to
it the hatr and contempt of the crowd punish such men for discern
the higher law
for russian historian strang and terribl to sai napoleonthat most
insignific tool of histori who never anywher even in exil show
human dignitynapoleon is the object of adul and enthusiasm he
is grand but kutzovth man who from the begin to the end of hi
activ in 1812 never onc swerv by word or deed from borodin to
vlna present an exampl except in histori of selfsacrific
and a present conscious of the futur import of what wa
happeningkutzov seem to them someth indefinit and piti and
when speak of him and of the year 1812 thei alwai seem a littl
asham
and yet it is difficult to imagin an histor charact whose
activ wa so unswervingli direct to a singl aim and it would be
difficult to imagin ani aim more worthi or more conson with the
will of the whole peopl still more difficult would it be to find
an instanc in histori of the aim of an histor personag be so
complet accomplish as that to which all kutzov effort were
direct in 1812
kutzov never talk of forti centuri look down from the
pyramid of the sacrific he offer for the fatherland or of
what he intend to accomplish or had accomplish in gener he
said noth about himself adopt no pose alwai appear to be
the simplest and most ordinari of men and said the simplest and most
ordinari thing he wrote letter to hi daughter and to madam de
stal read novel like the societi of pretti women jest with
gener offic and soldier and never contradict those who tri
to prove anyth to him when count rostopchn at the yaza bridg
gallop up to kutzov with person reproach for have caus the
destruct of moscow and said how wa it you promis not to abandon
moscow without a battl kutzov repli and i shall not abandon
moscow without a battl though moscow wa then alreadi abandon when
arakchev come to him from the emperor said that ermlov ought to
be appoint chief of the artilleri kutzov repli ye i wa
just sai so myself though a moment befor he had said quit the
contrari what did it matter to himwho then alon amid a senseless
crowd understood the whole tremend signific of what wa
happeningwhat did it matter to him whether rostopchn attribut the
calam of moscow to him or to himself still less could it matter to
him who wa appoint chief of the artilleri
not mere in these case but continu did that old manwho by
experi of life had reach the convict that thought and the
word serv as their express ar not what move peopleus quit
meaningless word that happen to enter hi head
but that man so heedless of hi word did not onc dure the whole
time of hi activ utter on word inconsist with the singl aim
toward which he move throughout the whole war obvious in spite of
himself in veri divers circumst he repeatedli express hi real
thought with the bitter convict that he would not be understood
begin with the battl of borodin from which time hi disagr
with those about him began he alon said that the battl of borodin
wa a victori and repeat thi both verbal and in hi dispatch
and report up to the time of hi death he alon said that the loss of
moscow is not the loss of russia in repli to lauriston propos of
peac he said there can be no peac for such is the peopl will he
alon dure the retreat of the french said that all our maneuv ar
useless everyth is be accomplish of itself better than we could
desir that the enemi must be offer a golden bridg that neither
the tartino the vyzma nor the krsnoe battl were necessari that
we must keep some forc to reach the frontier with and that he would
not sacrific a singl russian for ten frenchmen
and thi courtier as he is describ to us who li to arakchev
to pleas the emperor he aloneincur therebi the emperor
displeasuresaid in vlna that to carri the war beyond the frontier is
useless and harm
nor do word alon prove that onli he understood the mean of the
event hi actionswithout the smallest deviationwer all direct
to on and the same threefold end 1 to brace all hi strength for
conflict with the french 2 to defeat them and 3 to drive them out
of russia minim as far as possibl the suffer of our peopl
and of our armi
thi procrastin kutzov whose motto wa patienc and time
thi enemi of decis action gave battl at borodin invest the
prepar for it with unparallel solemn thi kutzov who befor
the battl of austerlitz began said that it would be lost he alon in
contradict to everyon els declar till hi death that borodin
wa a victori despit the assur of gener that the battl wa
lost and despit the fact that for an armi to have to retir after
win a battl wa unpreced he alon dure the whole retreat
insist that battl which were useless then should not be fought
and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontier of russia
cross
it is easi now to understand the signific of these eventsif onli we
abstain from attribut to the activ of the mass aim that exist
onli in the head of a dozen individualsfor the event and result now
lie befor us
but how did that old man alon in opposit to the gener opinion
so truli discern the import of the peopl view of the event that
in all hi activ he wa never onc untru to it
the sourc of that extraordinari power of penetr the mean of the
event then occur lai in the nation feel which he possess in
full puriti and strength
onli the recognit of the fact that he possess thi feel caus
the peopl in so strang a manner contrari to the tsar wish to
select himan old man in disfavorto be their repres in the
nation war and onli that feel place him on that highest human
pedest from which he the command in chief devot all hi power
not to slai and destroi men but to save and show piti on
them

the french armi melt awai at the uniform rate of a mathemat
progress and that cross of the berzina about which so much ha
been written wa onli on intermedi stage in it destruct and
not at all the decis episod of the campaign if so much ha been
and still is written about the berzina on the french side thi is onli
becaus at the broken bridg across that river the calam their armi
had been previous endur were suddenli concentr at on moment
into a tragic spectacl that remain in everi memori and on the
russian side mere becaus in petersburgfar from the seat of wara
plan again on of pfuel had been devis to catch napoleon in a
strateg trap at the berzina river everyon assur himself that all
would happen accord to plan and therefor insist that it wa just
the cross of the berzina that destroi the french armi in realiti
the result of the cross were much less disastr to the frenchin
gun and men lostthan krsnoe had been as the figur show
the sole import of the cross of the berzina li in the fact
that it plainli and indubit prove the fallaci of all the plan for
cut off the enemi retreat and the sound of the onli possibl
line of actionth on kutzov and the gener mass of the armi
demandednam simpli to follow the enemi up the french crowd fled
at a continu increas speed and all it energi wa direct to
reach it goal it fled like a wound anim and it wa imposs
to block it path thi wa shown not so much by the arrang it
made for cross as by what took place at the bridg when the bridg
broke down unarm soldier peopl from moscow and women with
children who were with the french transport allcarri on by vi
inertipress forward into boat and into the icecov water and
did not surrend
that impuls wa reason the condit of fugit and of pursuer
wa equal bad as long as thei remain with their own peopl each
might hope for help from hi fellow and the definit place he held
among them but those who surrend while remain in the same
piti plight would be on a lower level to claim a share in the
necess of life the french did not need to be inform of the fact
that half the prisonerswith whom the russian did not know what to
doperish of cold and hunger despit their captor desir to save
them thei felt that it could not be otherwis the most compassion
russian command those favor to the frenchand even the frenchmen
in the russian servicecould do noth for the prison the french
perish from the condit to which the russian armi wa itself
expos it wa imposs to take bread and cloth from our hungri and
indispens soldier to give to the french who though not harm or
hate or guilti were simpli unnecessari some russian even did that
but thei were except
certain destruct lai behind the french but in front there wa hope
their ship had been burn there wa no salvat save in collect
flight and on that the whole strength of the french wa concentr
the farther thei fled the more wretch becam the plight of the
remnant especi after the berzina on which in consequ of the
petersburg plan special hope had been place by the russian and
the keener grew the passion of the russian command who blame on
anoth and kutzov most of all anticip that the failur of
the petersburg berzina plan would be attribut to kutzov led
to dissatisfact contempt and ridicul more and more strongli
express the ridicul and contempt were of cours express in a
respect form make it imposs for him to ask wherein he wa
to blame thei did not talk serious to him when report to him or
ask for hi sanction thei appear to be fulfil a regrett
formal but thei wink behind hi back and tri to mislead him at
everi turn
becaus thei could not understand him all these peopl assum that
it wa useless to talk to the old man that he would never grasp the
profund of their plan that he would answer with hi phrase which
thei thought were mere phrase about a golden bridg about the
imposs of cross the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalion
and so forth thei had heard all that befor and all he saidthat it
wa necessari to await provis or that the men had no bootswa so
simpl while what thei propos wa so complic and clever that
it wa evid that he wa old and stupid and that thei though not in
power were command of geniu
after the junction with the armi of the brilliant admir and petersburg
hero wittgenstein thi mood and the gossip of the staff reach their
maximum kutzov saw thi and mere sigh and shrug hi shoulder
onli onc after the affair of the berzina did he get angri and write
to bennigsen who report separ to the emperor the follow
letter

onc that hi dai wa over that hi part wa plai and that the power
he wa suppos to hold wa no longer hi and he understood thi not
mere from the attitud of the court he saw on the on hand that the
militari busi in which he had plai hi part wa end and felt
that hi mission wa accomplish and at the same time he began to
be consciou of the physic weari of hi ag bodi and of the
necess of physic rest

done in the realm of histori did not concern him at all
chichagv on of the most zealou cuttersoff and breakersup who
had first want to effect a divers in greec and then in warsaw but
never wish to go where he wa sent chichagv note for the bold
with which he spoke to the emperor and who consid kutzov to be
under an oblig to him becaus when he wa sent to make peac
with turkei in 1811 independ of kutzov and found that peac had
alreadi been conclud he admit to the emperor that the merit of
secur that peac wa realli kutzov thi chichagv wa the first
to meet kutzov at the castl where the latter wa to stai in undress
naval uniform with a dirk and hold hi cap under hi arm he hand
kutzov a garrison report and the kei of the town the contemptu
respect attitud of the younger men to the old man in hi dotag wa
express in the highest degre by the behavior of chichagv who knew
of the accus that were be direct against kutzov
when speak to chichagv kutzov incident mention that the
vehicl pack with china that had been captur from him at borsov
had been recov and would be restor to him

contrari i can suppli you with everyth even if you want to give
dinner parti warmli repli chichagv who tri by everi word he
spoke to prove hi own rectitud and therefor imagin kutzov to be
anim by the same desir
kutzov shrug hi shoulder repli with hi subtl penetr
smile i meant mere to sai what i said
contrari to the emperor wish kutzov detain the greater part of the
armi at vlna those about him said that he becam extraordinarili slack

there wa run to and fro and whisper anoth troyka flew
furious up and then all ey were turn on an approach sleigh
in which the figur of the emperor and volknski could alreadi be

at the veri moment when the emperor have alight from the sleigh

when alon with the field marshal the emperor express hi
dissatisfact at the slow of the pursuit and at the mistak made

futur campaign abroad kutzov made no rejoind or remark the same
submiss expressionless look with which he had listen to the
emperor command on the field of austerlitz seven year befor settl

when kutzov came out of the studi and with lower head wa cross
the ballroom with hi heavi waddl gait he wa arrest by someon

goodfornoth when kutzov conform to a custom of catherin
dai order the standard that had been captur to be lower at the
emperor feet on hi enter the ballroom the emperor made a wry face
and mutter someth in which some peopl caught the word the old

chapter xii
as gener happen pierr did not feel the full effect of the
physic privat and strain he had suffer as prison until after
thei were over after hi liber he reach orl and on the third
dai there when prepar to go to kiev he fell ill and wa laid up
for three month he had what the doctor term biliou fever but
despit the fact that the doctor treat him bled him and gave him
medicin to drink he recov
scarc ani impress wa left on pierr mind by all that happen
to him from the time of hi rescu till hi ill he rememb
onli the dull grai weather now raini and now snowi intern physic
distress and pain in hi feet and side he rememb a gener
impress of the misfortun and suffer of peopl and of be
worri by the curios of offic and gener who question him he
also rememb hi difficulti in procur a convey and hors and
abov all he rememb hi incapac to think and feel all that time
on the dai of hi rescu he had seen the bodi of ptya rostv that same
dai he had learn that princ andrew after surviv the battl of
borodin for more than a month had recent di in the rostv hous
at yaroslvl and densov who told him thi new also mention hlne
death suppos that pierr had heard of it long befor all thi at
the time seem mere strang to pierr he felt he could not grasp it
signific just then he wa onli anxiou to get awai as quickli as
possibl from place where peopl were kill on anoth to some
peac refug where he could recov himself rest and think over
all the strang new fact he had learn but on reach orl he
immedi fell ill when he came to himself after hi ill he saw
in attend on him two of hi servant ternti and vska who had
come from moscow and also hi cousin the eldest princess who had been
live on hi estat at elt and hear of hi rescu and ill had
come to look after him
it wa onli gradual dure hi convalesc that pierr lost the
impress he had becom accustom to dure the last few month
and got us to the idea that no on would oblig him to go anywher
tomorrow that no on would depriv him of hi warm bed and that he
would be sure to get hi dinner tea and supper but for a long time in
hi dream he still saw himself in the condit of captiv in the
same wai littl by littl he came to understand the new he had been
told after hi rescu about the death of princ andrew the death of
hi wife and the destruct of the french
a joyou feel of freedomthat complet inalien freedom natur
to man which he had first experienc at the first halt outsid
moscowfil pierr soul dure hi convalesc he wa surpris
to find that thi inner freedom which wa independ of extern
condit now had as it were an addit set of extern
liberti he wa alon in a strang town without acquaint no on
demand anyth of him or sent him anywher he had all he want
the thought of hi wife which had been a continu torment to him wa no
longer there sinc she wa no more
oh how good how splendid said he to himself when a cleanli laid
tabl wa move up to him with savori beef tea or when he lai down for
the night on a soft clean bed or when he rememb that the french had
gone and that hi wife wa no more oh how good how splendid
and by old habit he ask himself the question well and what then
what am i go to do and he immedi gave himself the answer
well i shall live ah how splendid
the veri question that had formerli torment him the thing he had
continu sought to findth aim of lifeno longer exist for
him now that search for the aim of life had not mere disappear
temporarilyh felt that it no longer exist for him and could not
present itself again and thi veri absenc of an aim gave him the
complet joyou sens of freedom which constitut hi happi at
thi time
he could not see an aim for he now had faithnot faith in ani kind of
rule or word or idea but faith in an everliv evermanifest
god formerli he had sought him in aim he set himself that search for
an aim had been simpli a search for god and suddenli in hi captiv
he had learn not by word or reason but by direct feel what hi
nurs had told him long ago that god is here and everywher in hi
captiv he had learn that in karatev god wa greater more infinit
and unfathom than in the architect of the univers recogn by the
freemason he felt like a man who after strain hi ey to see into
the far distanc find what he sought at hi veri feet all hi life
he had look over the head of the men around him when he should have
mere look in front of him without strain hi ey
in the past he had never been abl to find that great inscrut
infinit someth he had onli felt that it must exist somewher and
had look for it in everyth near and comprehens he had seen
onli what wa limit petti commonplac and senseless he had
equip himself with a mental telescop and look into remot space
where petti worldli hide itself in misti distanc had seem to
him great and infinit mere becaus it wa not clearli seen and such
had european life polit freemasonri philosophi and philanthropi
seem to him but even then at moment of weak as he had account
them hi mind had penetr to those distanc and he had there seen
the same petti worldli and senseless now howev he
had learn to see the great etern and infinit in everyth and
thereforeto see it and enjoi it contemplationh natur threw awai
the telescop through which he had till now gaze over men head and
gladli regard the everchang etern great unfathom and
infinit life around him and the closer he look the more tranquil and
happi he becam that dread question what for which had formerli
destroi all hi mental edific no longer exist for him to that
question what for a simpl answer wa now alwai readi in hi soul
becaus there is a god that god without whose will not on hair fall
from a man head
chapter xiii
in extern wai pierr had hardli chang at all in appear he
wa just what he us to be as befor he wa absentmind and seem
occupi not with what wa befor hi ey but with someth special
of hi own the differ between hi former and present self wa that
formerli when he did not grasp what lai befor him or wa said to
him he had pucker hi forehead painfulli as if vainli seek to
distinguish someth at a distanc at present he still forgot what wa
said to him and still did not see what wa befor hi ey but he now
look with a scarc percept and seemingli iron smile at what
wa befor him and listen to what wa said though evid see
and hear someth quit differ formerli he had appear to be
a kindheart but unhappi man and so peopl had been inclin to avoid
him now a smile at the joi of life alwai plai round hi lip and
sympathi for other shone in hi ey with a question look as to
whether thei were as content as he wa and peopl felt pleas by hi
presenc
previous he had talk a great deal grew excit when he talk and
seldom listen now he wa seldom carri awai in convers and
knew how to listen so that peopl readili told him their most intim
secret
the princess who had never like pierr and had been particularli
hostil to him sinc she had felt herself under oblig to him after
the old count death now after stai a short time in orlwher she
had come intend to show pierr that in spite of hi ingratitud she
consid it her duti to nurs himfelt to her surpris and vexat
that she had becom fond of him pierr did not in ani wai seek her
approv he mere studi her with interest formerli she had felt
that he regard her with indiffer and ironi and so had shrunk into
herself as she did with other and had shown him onli the comb side
of her natur but now he seem to be try to understand the most
intim place of her heart and mistrustfulli at first but afterward
gratefulli she let him see the hidden kindli side of her charact
the most cun man could not have crept into her confid more
successfulli evok memori of the best time of her youth and
show sympathi with them yet pierr cun consist simpli in
find pleasur in draw out the human qualiti of the embitt
hard and in her own wai proud princess
ye he is a veri veri kind man when he is not under the influenc of
bad peopl but of peopl such as myself thought she
hi servant tooternti and vskain their own wai notic the chang
that had taken place in pierr thei consid that he had becom much
simpler ternti when he had help him undress and wish him good
night often linger with hi master boot in hi hand and cloth
over hi arm to see whether he would not start a talk and pierr
notic that ternti want a chat gener kept him there
well tell me now how did you get food he would ask
and ternti would begin talk of the destruct of moscow and of
the old count and would stand for a long time hold the cloth and
talk or sometim listen to pierr stori and then would go
out into the hall with a pleasant sens of intimaci with hi master and
affect for him
the doctor who attend pierr and visit him everi dai though he
consid it hi duti as a doctor to pose as a man whose everi moment
wa of valu to suffer human would sit for hour with pierr
tell him hi favorit anecdot and hi observ on the
charact of hi patient in gener and especi of the ladi
it a pleasur to talk to a man like that he is not like our
provinci he would sai
there were sever prison from the french armi in orl and the
doctor brought on of them a young italian to see pierr
thi offic began visit pierr and the princess us to make fun of
the tender the italian express for him
the italian seem happi onli when he could come to see pierr talk
with him tell him about hi past hi life at home and hi love
and pour out to him hi indign against the french and especi
against napoleon
if all russian ar in the least like you it is sacrileg to fight
such a nation he said to pierr you who have suffer so from the
french do not even feel animos toward them
pierr had evok the passion affect of the italian mere by
evok the best side of hi natur and take a pleasur in so do
dure the last dai of pierr stai in orl hi old mason

that peopl who meet in a desert gener express for on anoth
willarski felt dull in orl and wa pleas to meet a man of hi own
circl and as he suppos of similar interest
but to hi surpris willarski soon notic that pierr had lag much
behind the time and had sunk as he express it to himself into
apathi and egot
you ar let yourself go my dear fellow he said
but for all that willarski found it pleasant now than it had been
formerli to be with pierr and came to see him everi dai to pierr as
he look at and listen to willarski it seem strang to think that
he had been like that himself but a short time befor
willarski wa a marri man with a famili busi with hi famili affair
hi wife affair and hi offici duti he regard all these
occup as hindranc to life and consid that thei were all
contempt becaus their aim wa the welfar of himself and hi
famili militari administr polit and mason interest
continu absorb hi attent and pierr without try to
chang the other view and without condemn him but with the quiet
joy and amus smile now habitu to him wa interest in thi
strang though veri familiar phenomenon
there wa a new featur in pierr relat with willarski with the
princess with the doctor and with all the peopl he now met which
gain for him the gener good will thi wa hi acknowledg of
the imposs of chang a man convict by word and hi
recognit of the possibl of everyon think feel and see

each individu which us to excit and irrit pierr now becam a
basi of the sympathi he felt for and the interest he took in other
peopl the differ and sometim complet contradict between
men opinion and their live and between on man and anoth pleas

in practic matter pierr unexpectedli felt within himself a center
of graviti he had previous lack formerli all pecuniari question
especi request for monei to which as an extrem wealthi man
he wa veri expos produc in him a state of hopeless agit and
perplex to give or not to give he had ask himself i have
it and he need it but someon els need it still more who need it
most and perhap thei ar both impostor in the old dai he had been
unabl to find a wai out of all these surmis and had given to all
who ask as long as he had anyth to give formerli he had been in a
similar state of perplex with regard to everi question concern hi
properti when on person advis on thing and anoth someth els
now to hi surpris he found that he no longer felt either doubt or
perplex about these question there wa now within him a judg who
by some rule unknown to him decid what should or should not be done
he wa as indiffer as heretofor to monei matter but now he felt
certain of what ought and what ought not to be done the first time he
had recours to hi new judg wa when a french prison a colonel
came to him and after talk a great deal about hi exploit
conclud by make what amount to a demand that pierr should give
him four thousand franc to send to hi wife and children pierr
refus without the least difficulti or effort and wa afterward
surpris how simpl and easi had been what us to appear so
insurmount difficult at the same time that he refus the colonel
demand he made up hi mind that he must have recours to artific when
leav orl to induc the italian offic to accept some monei of
which he wa evid in need a further proof to pierr of hi own
more settl outlook on practic matter wa furnish by hi decis
with regard to hi wife debt and to the rebuild of hi hous in
and near moscow
hi head steward came to him at orl and pierr reckon up with him hi
diminish incom the burn of moscow had cost him accord to the
head steward calcul about two million rubl

it would be difficult to explain why and whither ant whose heap
ha been destroi ar hurri some from the heap drag bit of
rubbish larva and corps other back to the heap or why thei
jostl overtak on anoth and fight and it would be equal
difficult to explain what caus the russian after the departur of the
french to throng to the place that had formerli been moscow but when
we watch the ant round their ruin heap the tenac energi and
immens number of the delv insect prove that despit the destruct

but the first plunder were follow by a second and a third
conting and with increas number plunder becam more and more
difficult and assum more definit form
the french found moscow abandon but with all the organ of
regular life with divers branch of commerc and craftsmanship with
luxuri and government and religi institut these form were
lifeless but still exist there were bazaar shop warehous
market stall granariesfor the most part still stock with goodsand
there were factori and workshop palac and wealthi hous fill
with luxuri hospit prison govern offic church and
cathedr the longer the french remain the more these form of town
life perish until final all wa merg into on confus lifeless
scene of plunder
the more the plunder by the french continu the more both the
wealth of moscow and the strength of it plunder wa destroi but
plunder by the russian with which the reoccup of the citi
began had an opposit effect the longer it continu and the greater
the number of peopl take part in it the more rapidli wa the wealth

natsha seldom occur to him if it did it wa onli as a pleasant
memori of the distant past he felt himself not onli free from social

everi word that he or natsha had spoken and pictur everi detail of
her face and smile and did not wish to diminish or add anyth but

whole worldseem to him center in hi love and the possibl of
be love by her at time everybodi seem to him to be occupi with

surpris those he met by hi significantli happi look and smile which

he realiz that peopl might not be awar of hi happi he piti
them with hi whole heart and felt a desir somehow to explain to them
that all that occupi them wa a mere frivol trifl unworthi of
attent
when it wa suggest to him that he should enter the civil servic
or when the war or ani gener polit affair were discuss on the
assumpt that everybodi welfar depend on thi or that issu
of event he would listen with a mild and piti smile and surpris
peopl by hi strang comment but at thi time he saw everybodyboth

chapter xx
after pierr departur that first even when natsha had said to
princess mari with a gaili mock smile he look just ye just as
if he had come out of a russian bathin a short coat and with hi hair
crop someth hidden and unknown to herself but irrepress
awok in natsha soul
everyth her face walk look and voic wa suddenli alter
to her own surpris a power of life and hope of happi rose to the
surfac and demand satisfact from that even she seem to have
forgotten all that had happen to her she no longer complain of her
posit did not sai a word about the past and no longer fear to
make happi plan for the futur she spoke littl of pierr but when
princess mari mention him a longextinguish light onc more kindl
in her ey and her lip curv with a strang smile
the chang that took place in natsha at first surpris princess mari
but when she understood it mean it griev her can she have love
my brother so littl as to be abl to forget him so soon she thought
when she reflect on the chang but when she wa with natsha she wa
not vex with her and did not reproach her the reawaken power
of life that had seiz natsha wa so evid irrepress and
unexpect by her that in her presenc princess mari felt that she had
no right to reproach her even in her heart
natsha gave herself up so fulli and frankli to thi new feel that
she did not try to hide the fact that she wa no longer sad but bright
and cheer
when princess mari return to her room after her nocturn talk with
pierr natsha met her on the threshold
he ha spoken ye he ha spoken she repeat
and a joy yet pathet express which seem to beg forgiv for

chapter i
seven year had pass the stormtoss sea of european histori had
subsid within it shore and seem to have becom calm but the
mysteri forc that move human mysteri becaus the law of
their motion ar unknown to us continu to oper
though the surfac of the sea of histori seem motionless the movement
of human went on as unceasingli as the flow of time variou group
of peopl form and dissolv the come format and dissolut of
kingdom and displac of peopl wa in cours of prepar
the sea of histori wa not driven spasmod from shore to shore as
previous it wa seeth in it depth histor figur were not
born by the wave from on shore to anoth as befor thei now seem
to rotat on on spot the histor figur at the head of armi
who formerli reflect the movement of the mass by order war
campaign and battl now reflect the restless movement by polit
and diplomat combin law and treati
the historian call thi activ of the histor figur the
reaction
in deal with thi period thei sternli condemn the histor
personag who in their opinion caus what thei describ as the
reaction all the wellknown peopl of that period from alexand and
napoleon to madam de stal photiu schell ficht chateaubriand
and the rest pass befor their stern judgment seat and ar acquit or
condemn accord to whether thei conduc to progress or to reaction
accord to their account a reaction took place at that time in russia
also and the chief culprit wa alexand i the same man who accord
to them wa the chief caus of the liber movement at the commenc
of hi reign be the savior of russia
there is no on in russian literatur now from schoolboi essayist to
learn historian who doe not throw hi littl stone at alexand for
thing he did wrong at thi period of hi reign
he ought to have act in thi wai and in that wai in thi case he did
well and in that case badli he behav admir at the begin of
hi reign and dure 1812 but act badli by give a constitut
to poland form the holi allianc entrust power to arakchev
favor goltsyn and mystic and afterward shishkv and photiu
he also act badli by concern himself with the activ armi and
disband the semnov regiment
it would take a dozen page to enumer all the reproach the
historian address to him base on their knowledg of what is good for
human
what do these reproach mean
do not the veri action for which the historian prais alexand i
the liber attempt at the begin of hi reign hi struggl with
napoleon the firm he displai in 1812 and the campaign of 1813
flow from the same sourcesth circumst of hi birth educ
and lifethat made hi person what it wa and from which the
action for which thei blame him the holi allianc the restor of
poland and the reaction of 1820 and later also flow
in what doe the substanc of those reproach lie
it li in the fact that an histor charact like alexand i
stand on the highest possibl pinnacl of human power with the
blind light of histori focus upon him a charact expos to those
strongest of all influenc the intrigu flatteri and selfdecept
insepar from power a charact who at everi moment of hi life
felt a respons for all that wa happen in europ and not
a fictiti but a live charact who like everi man had hi person
habit passion and impuls toward good beauti and truththat
thi characterthough not lack in virtu the historian do not
accus him of thathad not the same concept of the welfar of
human fifti year ago as a presentdai professor who from hi
youth upward ha been occupi with learn that is with book and
lectur and with take note from them
but even if we assum that fifti year ago alexand i wa mistaken in
hi view of what wa good for the peopl we must inevit assum that
the historian who judg alexand will also after the laps of some
time turn out to be mistaken in hi view of what is good for human
thi assumpt is all the more natur and inevit becaus watch
the movement of histori we see that everi year and with each new
writer opinion as to what is good for mankind chang so that what
onc seem good ten year later seem bad and vice versa and what is
more we find at on and the same time quit contradictori view as to
what is bad and what is good in histori some peopl regard give a
constitut to poland and form the holi allianc as praiseworthi in
alexand while other regard it as blameworthi
the activ of alexand or of napoleon cannot be call us or
harm for it is imposs to sai for what it wa us or harm
if that activ displeas somebodi thi is onli becaus it doe
not agre with hi limit understand of what is good whether the
preserv of my father hous in moscow or the glori of the russian
arm or the prosper of the petersburg and other univers or the
freedom of poland or the great of russia or the balanc of power in
europ or a certain kind of european cultur call progress appear
to me to be good or bad i must admit that besid these thing the
action of everi histor charact ha other more gener purpos
inaccess to me
but let us assum that what is call scienc can harmon all
contradict and possess an unchang standard of good and bad by
which to try histor charact and event let us sai that alexand
could have done everyth differ let us sai that with guidanc
from those who blame him and who profess to know the ultim aim of the
movement of human he might have arrang matter accord to
the program hi present accus would have given himof nation
freedom equal and progress these i think cover the ground let
us assum that thi program wa possibl and had then been formul
and that alexand had act on it what would then have becom of the
activ of all those who oppos the tendenc that then prevail in
the governmentan activ that in the opinion of the historian wa
good and benefic their activ would not have exist there would
have been no life there would have been noth
if we admit that human life can be rule by reason the possibl of
life is destroi
chapter ii
if we assum as the historian do that great men lead human to the
attain of certain endsth great of russia or of franc
the balanc of power in europ the diffus of the idea of the
revolut gener progress or anyth elsethen it is imposs
to explain the fact of histori without introduc the concept of
chanc and geniu
if the aim of the european war at the begin of the nineteenth
centuri had been the aggrandiz of russia that aim might have been
accomplish without all the preced war and without the invas if
the aim wa the aggrandiz of franc that might have been attain
without the revolut and without the empir if the aim wa the
dissemin of idea the print press could have accomplish that
much better than warfar if the aim wa the progress of civil
it is easi to see that there ar other wai of diffus civil
more expedi than by the destruct of wealth and of human live
why did it happen in thi and not in some other wai
becaus it happen so chanc creat the situat geniu util
it sai histori
but what is chanc what is geniu
the word chanc and geniu do not denot ani realli exist thing and
therefor cannot be defin those word onli denot a certain stage of
understand of phenomena i do not know why a certain event occur i
think that i cannot know it so i do not try to know it and i talk about
chanc i see a forc produc effect beyond the scope of ordinari
human agenc i do not understand why thi occur and i talk of
geniu
to a herd of ram the ram the herdsman drive each even into a
special enclosur to feed and that becom twice as fat as the other
must seem to be a geniu and it must appear an astonish conjunct
of geniu with a whole seri of extraordinari chanc that thi ram
who instead of get into the gener fold everi even goe into a
special enclosur where there ar oatsthat thi veri ram swell with
fat is kill for meat
but the ram need onli ceas to suppos that all that happen to them
happen sole for the attain of their sheepish aim thei need onli
admit that what happen to them mai also have purpos beyond their ken
and thei will at onc perceiv a uniti and coher in what happen
to the ram that wa fatten even if thei do not know for what purpos
thei ar fatten thei will at least know that all that happen to the
ram did not happen accident and will no longer need the concept
of chanc or geniu
onli by renounc our claim to discern a purpos immedi
intellig to us and admit the ultim purpos to be beyond our
ken mai we discern the sequenc of experi in the live of
histor charact and perceiv the caus of the effect thei produc
incommensur with ordinari human capabl and then the word
chanc and geniu becom superflu
we need onli confess that we do not know the purpos of the european
convuls and that we know onli the factsthat is the murder first
in franc then in itali in africa in prussia in austria in spain
and in russiaand that the movement from the west to the east and from
the east to the west form the essenc and purpos of these event and
not onli shall we have no need to see except abil and geniu in
napoleon and alexand but we shall be unabl to consid them to
be anyth but like other men and we shall not be oblig to have
recours to chanc for an explan of those small event which made
these peopl what thei were but it will be clear that all those small
event were inevit
by discard a claim to knowledg of the ultim purpos we shall
clearli perceiv that just as on cannot imagin a blossom or seed for
ani singl plant better suit to it than those it produc so it is
imposs to imagin ani two peopl more complet adapt down to the
smallest detail for the purpos thei had to fulfil than napoleon and
alexand with all their anteced

the fundament and essenti signific of the european event of the
begin of the nineteenth centuri li in the movement of the mass of
the european peopl from west to east and afterward from east to west
the commenc of that movement wa the movement from west to east
for the peopl of the west to be abl to make their warlik movement

militari group of the east 2 that thei should abandon all establish
tradit and custom and 3 that dure their militari movement thei
should have at their head a man who could justifi to himself and to them
the decept robberi and murder which would have to be commit
dure that movement
and begin with the french revolut the old inadequ larg
group wa destroi as well as the old habit and tradit and step
by step a group wa form of larger dimens with new custom and
tradit and a man wa produc who would stand at the head of the
come movement and bear the respons for all that had to be done

in the winter of 1813 nichola marri princess mari and move to bald
hill with hi wife hi mother and snya
within four year he had paid off all hi remain debt without
sell ani of hi wife properti and have receiv a small
inherit on the death of a cousin he paid hi debt to pierr as well
in anoth three year by 1820 he had so manag hi affair that he
wa abl to bui a small estat adjoin bald hill and wa negoti
to bui back otrdnoethat be hi pet dream
have start farm from necess he soon grew so devot to it
that it becam hi favorit and almost hi sole occup nichola wa
a plain farmer he did not like innov especi the english on
then come into vogu he laugh at theoret treatis on estat
manag dislik factori the rais of expens product
and the bui of expens seed corn and did not make a hobbi of ani
particular part of the work on hi estat he alwai had befor hi
mind ey the estat as a whole and not ani particular part of it the
chief thing in hi ey wa not the nitrogen in the soil nor the oxygen
in the air nor manur nor special plow but that most import
agent by which nitrogen oxygen manur and plow were made
effectiveth peasant labor when nichola first began farm
and began to understand it differ branch it wa the serf who
especi attract hi attent the peasant seem to him not mere
a tool but also a judg of farm and an end in himself at first
he watch the serf try to understand their aim and what thei
consid good and bad and onli pretend to direct them and give
order while in realiti learn from them their method their manner
of speech and their judgment of what wa good and bad onli when he
had understood the peasant tast and aspir had learn to talk
their languag to grasp the hidden mean of their word and felt
akin to them did he begin boldli to manag hi serf that is to
perform toward them the duti demand of him and nichola manag
produc veri brilliant result
guid by some gift of insight on take up the manag of the
estat he at onc unerringli appoint as bailiff villag elder and
deleg the veri men the serf would themselv have chosen had thei
had the right to choos and these post never chang hand befor
analyz the properti of manur befor enter into the debit and
credit as he iron call it he found out how mani cattl the
peasant had and increas the number by all possibl mean he kept the
peasant famili togeth in the largest group possibl not allow
the famili group to divid into separ household he wa hard alik
on the lazi the deprav and the weak and tri to get them expel
from the commun
he wa as care of the sow and reap of the peasant hai
and corn as of hi own and few landown had their crop sown
and harvest so earli and so well or got so good a return as did
nichola
he dislik have anyth to do with the domest serfsth drone
as he call themand everyon said he spoil them by hi laxiti when
a decis had to be taken regard a domest serf especi if on
had to be punish he alwai felt undecid and consult everybodi in
the hous but when it wa possibl to have a domest serf conscript
instead of a land worker he did so without the least hesit he
never felt ani hesit in deal with the peasant he knew that hi
everi decis would be approv by them all with veri few except
he did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man or to
make thing easi for or reward anyon mere becaus he felt inclin
to do so he could not have said by what standard he judg what he
should or should not do but the standard wa quit firm and definit in
hi own mind
often speak with vexat of some failur or irregular he would
sai what can on do with our russian peasant and imagin that he
could not bear them
yet he love our russian peasant and their wai of life with hi whole
soul and for that veri reason had understood and assimil the on
wai and manner of farm which produc good result
countess mari wa jealou of thi passion of her husband and regret
that she could not share it but she could not understand the joi and
vexat he deriv from that world to her so remot and alien she
could not understand why he wa so particularli anim and happi
when after get up at daybreak and spend the whole morn in the
field or on the thresh floor he return from the sow or mow
or reap to have tea with her she did not understand why he spoke
with such admir and delight of the farm of the thrifti and
welltodo peasant matthew ermshin who with hi famili had cart
corn all night or of the fact that hi nichola sheav were alreadi
stack befor anyon els had hi harvest in she did not understand
why he step out from the window to the veranda and smile under hi
mustach and wink so joyfulli when warm steadi rain began to fall
on the dry and thirsti shoot of the young oat or why when the wind
carri awai a threaten cloud dure the hai harvest he would return
from the barn flush sunburn and perspir with a smell of
wormwood and gentian in hi hair and gleefulli rub hi hand would
sai well on more dai and my grain and the peasant will all be
under cover
still less did she understand why he kindheart and alwai readi to
anticip her wish should becom almost desper when she brought
him a petit from some peasant men or women who had appeal to her
to be excus some work why he that kind nichola should obstin
refus her angrili ask her not to interfer in what wa not her
busi she felt he had a world apart which he love passion and
which had law she had not fathom
sometim when try to understand him she spoke of the good work he
wa do for hi serf he would be vex and repli not in the least
it never enter my head and i wouldnt do that for their good that
all poetri and old wive talkal that do good to on neighbor
what i want is that our children should not have to go beg i must
put our affair in order while i am aliv that all and to do that
order and strict ar essenti that all about it said he
clench hi vigor fist and fair of cours he ad for
if the peasant is nake and hungri and ha onli on miser hors he
can do no good either for himself or for me
and all nichola did wa fruitfulprob just becaus he refus to
allow himself to think that he wa do good to other for virtu
sake hi mean increas rapidli serf from neighbor estat came
to beg him to bui them and long after hi death the memori of hi
administr wa devoutli preserv among the serf he wa a
master the peasant affair first and then hi own of cours he wa
not to be trifl with eitherin a word he wa a real master
chapter viii
on matter connect with hi manag sometim worri nichola and
that wa hi quick temper togeth with hi old hussar habit of make
free us of hi fist at first he saw noth reprehens in
thi but in the second year of hi marriag hi view of that form of
punish suddenli chang
onc in summer he had sent for the villag elder from boguchrovo a
man who had succeed to the post when dron di and who wa accus of
dishonesti and variou irregular nichola went out into the porch
to question him and immedi after the elder had given a few repli
the sound of cri and blow were heard on return to lunch nichola
went up to hi wife who sat with her head bent low over her embroideri
frame and as usual began to tell her what he had been do that
morn among other thing he spoke of the boguchrovo elder countess
mari turn red and then pale but continu to sit with head bow and
lip compress and gave her husband no repli
such an insol scoundrel he cri grow hot again at the mere
recollect of him if he had told me he wa drunk and did not see
but what is the matter with you mari he suddenli ask
countess mari rais her head and tri to speak but hastili look
down again and her lip pucker
why whatev is the matter my dearest
the look of the plain countess mari alwai improv when she wa in
tear she never cri from pain or vexat but alwai from sorrow or
piti and when she wept her radiant ey acquir an irresist charm
the moment nichola took her hand she could no longer restrain herself
and began to cry
nichola i saw it he wa to blame but why do you nichola and
she cover her face with her hand
nichola said noth he flush crimson left her side and pace up
and down the room he understood what she wa weep about but could
not in hi heart at onc agre with her that what he had regard
from childhood as quit an everydai event wa wrong is it just
sentiment old wive tale or is she right he ask himself
befor he had solv that point he glanc again at her face fill with
love and pain and he suddenli realiz that she wa right and that he
had long been sin against himself
mari he said softli go up to her it will never happen again
i give you my word never he repeat in a trembl voic like a boi
ask for forgiv
the tear flow faster still from the countess ey she took hi hand
and kiss it
nichola when did you break your cameo she ask to chang the
subject look at hi finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of
laocon head
todayit wa the same affair oh mari dont remind me of it and
again he flush i give you my word of honor it shant occur again
and let thi alwai be a remind to me and he point to the broken
ring
after that when in discuss with hi villag elder or steward the
blood rush to hi face and hi fist began to clench nichola would
turn the broken ring on hi finger and would drop hi ey befor the
man who wa make him angri but he did forget himself onc or twice
within a twelvemonth and then he would go and confess to hi wife and
would again promis that thi should realli be the veri last time
mari you must despis me he would sai i deserv it
you should go go awai at onc if you dont feel strong enough to
control yourself she would repli sadli try to comfort her husband
among the gentri of the provinc nichola wa respect but not like
he did not concern himself with the interest of hi own class and
consequ some thought him proud and other thought him stupid the
whole summer from spring sow to harvest he wa busi with the work
on hi farm in autumn he gave himself up to hunt with the same
businesslik seriousnessleav home for a month or even two with
hi hunt in winter he visit hi other villag or spent hi time
read the book he read were chiefli histor and on these he
spent a certain sum everi year he wa collect as he said a seriou
librari and he made it a rule to read through all the book he bought
he would sit in hi studi with a grave air readinga task he first
impos upon himself as a duti but which afterward becam a habit
afford him a special kind of pleasur and a conscious of
be occupi with seriou matter in winter except for busi
excurs he spent most of hi time at home make himself on with
hi famili and enter into all the detail of hi children relat
with their mother the harmoni between him and hi wife grew closer and
closer and he daili discov fresh spiritu treasur in her
from the time of hi marriag snya had live in hi hous befor
that nichola had told hi wife all that had pass between himself and
snya blame himself and commend her he had ask princess mari to
be gentl and kind to hi cousin she thoroughli realiz the wrong he
had done snya felt herself to blame toward her and imagin that her
wealth had influenc nichola choic she could not find fault with
snya in ani wai and tri to be fond of her but often felt illwil
toward her which she could not overcom
onc she had a talk with her friend natsha about snya and about her
own injustic toward her
you know said natsha you have read the gospel a great dealther
is a passag in them that just fit snya
what ask countess mari surpris
to him that hath shall be given and from him that hath not shall be
taken awai you rememb she is on that hath not why i dont know

everyth ha been taken awai sometim i am dreadfulli sorri for her
formerli i veri much want nichola to marri her but i alwai had
a sort of presenti that it would not come off she is a steril
flower you knowlik some strawberri blossom sometim i am sorri for
her and sometim i think she doesnt feel it as you or i would
though countess mari told natsha that those word in the gospel must be
understood differ yet look at snya she agre with natsha
explan it realli seem that snya did not feel her posit
try and had grown quit reconcil to her lot as a steril flower
she seem to be fond not so much of individu as of the famili as a
whole like a cat she had attach herself not to the peopl but to the
home she wait on the old countess pet and spoil the children
wa alwai readi to render the small servic for which she had a gift
and all thi wa unconsci accept from her with insuffici

chapter x
natsha had marri in the earli spring of 1813 and in 1820 alreadi had
three daughter besid a son for whom she had long and whom she wa
now nurs she had grown stouter and broader so that it wa difficult
to recogn in thi robust motherli woman the slim live natsha of
former dai her featur were more defin and had a calm soft
and seren express in her face there wa none of the everglow
anim that had formerli burn there and constitut it charm
now her face and bodi were often all that on saw and her soul wa
not visibl at all all that struck the ey wa a strong handsom and
fertil woman the old fire veri rare kindl in her face now that
happen onli when as wa the case that dai her husband return home
or a sick child wa convalesc or when she and countess mari spoke of
princ andrew she never mention him to her husband who she imagin
wa jealou of princ andrew memori or on the rare occas when
someth happen to induc her to sing a practic she had quit
abandon sinc her marriag at the rare moment when the old fire
did kindl in her handsom fulli develop bodi she wa even more
attract than in former dai
sinc their marriag natsha and her husband had live in moscow in
petersburg on their estat near moscow or with her mother that is to
sai in nichola hous the young countess bezkhova wa not often seen
in societi and those who met her there were not pleas with her
and found her neither attract nor amiabl not that natsha like
solitudesh did not know whether she like it or not she even thought
that she did notbut with her pregnanc her confin the nurs
of her children and share everi moment of her husband life she had
demand on her time which could be satisfi onli by renounc societi
all who had known natsha befor her marriag wonder at the chang
in her as at someth extraordinari onli the old countess with her
matern instinct had realiz that all natsha outburst had been due
to her need of children and a husbanda she herself had onc exclaim
at otrdno not so much in fun as in earnestand her mother wa now
surpris at the surpris express by those who had never understood
natsha and she kept sai that she had alwai known that natsha
would make an exemplari wife and mother
onli she let her love of her husband and children overflow all
bound said the countess so that it even becom absurd
natsha did not follow the golden rule advoc by clever folk
especi by the french which sai that a girl should not let herself
go when she marri should not neglect her accomplish should be
even more care of her appear than when she wa unmarri and
should fascin her husband as much as she did befor he becam her
husband natsha on the contrari had at onc abandon all her witcheri
of which her sing had been an unusu power part she gave it up
just becaus it wa so powerfulli seduct she took no pain with
her manner or with delicaci of speech or with her toilet or to show
herself to her husband in her most becom attitud or to avoid
inconvenienc him by be too exact she act in contradict
to all those rule she felt that the allur instinct had formerli
taught her to us would now be mere ridicul in the ey of
her husband to whom she had from the first moment given herself up
entirelythat is with her whole soul leav no corner of it hidden
from him she felt that her uniti with her husband wa not maintain
by the poetic feel that had attract him to her but by someth
elseindefinit but firm as the bond between her own bodi and soul
to fluff out her curl put on fashion dress and sing romant
song to fascin her husband would have seem as strang as to adorn
herself to attract herself to adorn herself for other might perhap
have been agreeablesh did not knowbut she had no time at all for it
the chief reason for devot no time either to sing to dress or
to choos her word wa that she realli had no time to spare for these
thing
we know that man ha the faculti of becom complet absorb in
a subject howev trivial it mai be and that there is no subject so
trivial that it will not grow to infinit proport if on entir
attent is devot to it
the subject which wholli engross natsha attent wa her famili
that is her husband whom she had to keep so that he should belong
entir to her and to the home and the children whom she had to bear
bring into the world nurs and bring up
and the deeper she penetr not with her mind onli but with her whole
soul her whole be into the subject that absorb her the larger
did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequ did her power
appear so that she concentr them wholli on that on thing and yet
wa unabl to accomplish all that she consid necessari
there were then as now convers and discuss about women
right the relat of husband and wife and their freedom and right
though these theme were not yet term question as thei ar now but
these topic were not mere uninterest to natsha she posit
did not understand them
these question then as now exist onli for those who see noth in
marriag but the pleasur marri peopl get from on anoth that is
onli the begin of marriag and not it whole signific which
li in the famili
discuss and question of that kind which ar like the question of
how to get the greatest gratif from on dinner did not then
and do not now exist for those for whom the purpos of a dinner is the
nourish it afford and the purpos of marriag is the famili
if the purpos of dinner is to nourish the bodi a man who eat two
dinner at onc mai perhap get more enjoy but will not attain hi
purpos for hi stomach will not digest the two dinner
if the purpos of marriag is the famili the person who wish to have
mani wive or husband mai perhap obtain much pleasur but in that
case will not have a famili
if the purpos of food is nourish and the purpos of marriag is the
famili the whole question resolv itself into not eat more than on
can digest and not have more wive or husband than ar need for
the familythat is on wife or on husband natsha need a husband a
husband wa given her and he gave her a famili and she not onli saw no
need of ani other or better husband but as all the power of her soul
were intent on serv that husband and famili she could not imagin
and saw no interest in imagin how it would be if thing were
differ
natsha did not care for societi in gener but prize the more the
societi of her relativescountess mari and her brother her mother and
snya she valu the compani of those to whom she could come stride
dishevel from the nurseri in her dress gown and with joy face
show a yellow instead of a green stain on babi napkin and from whom
she could hear reassur word to the effect that babi wa much better
to such an extent had natsha let herself go that the wai she dress
and did her hair her illchosen word and her jealousysh wa jealou
of snya of the gover and of everi woman pretti or plainwer
habitu subject of jest to those about her the gener opinion wa
that pierr wa under hi wife thumb which wa realli true from the
veri first dai of their marri life natsha had announc her demand
pierr wa greatli surpris by hi wife view to him a perfectli
novel on that everi moment of hi life belong to her and to the
famili hi wife demand astonish him but thei also flatter him
and he submit to them
pierr subject consist in the fact that he not onli dare not
flirt with but dare not even speak smilingli to ani other woman did
not dare dine at the club as a pastim did not dare spend monei on a
whim and did not dare absent himself for ani length of time except on
businessin which hi wife includ hi intellectu pursuit which
she did not in the least understand but to which she attribut great
import to make up for thi at home pierr had the right to
regul hi life and that of the whole famili exactli as he chose at
home natsha place herself in the posit of a slave to her husband
and the whole household went on tipto when he wa occupiedthat is wa
read or write in hi studi pierr had but to show a partial for
anyth to get just what he like done alwai he had onli to express a
wish and natsha would jump up and run to fulfil it
the entir household wa govern accord to pierr suppos order
that is by hi wish which natsha tri to guess their wai of
life and place of resid their acquaint and ti natsha
occup the children upbring were all select not mere
with regard to pierr express wish but to what natsha from the
thought he express in convers suppos hi wish to be and she
deduc the essenti of hi wish quit correctli and have onc
arriv at them clung to them tenaci when pierr himself want to
chang hi mind she would fight him with hi own weapon
thu in a time of troubl ever memor to him after the birth of their
first child who wa delic when thei had to chang the wet nurs
three time and natsha fell ill from despair pierr on dai told her
of rousseau view with which he quit agre that to have a wet
nurs is unnatur and harm when her next babi wa born despit
the opposit of her mother the doctor and even of her husband
himselfwho were all vigor oppos to her nurs her babi herself
a thing then unheard of and consid injurioussh insist on have
her own wai and after that nurs all her babi herself
it veri often happen that in a moment of irrit husband and wife
would have a disput but long afterward pierr to hi surpris and
delight would find in hi wife idea and action the veri thought
against which she had argu but divest of everyth superflu
that in the excit of the disput he had ad when express hi
opinion
after seven year of marriag pierr had the joyou and firm
conscious that he wa not a bad man and he felt thi becaus he saw
himself reflect in hi wife he felt the good and bad within himself
inextric mingl and overlap but onli what wa realli good in
him wa reflect in hi wife all that wa not quit good wa reject
and thi wa not the result of logic reason but wa a direct and
mysteri reflect

he alon could plai on the clavichord that cossais hi onli piec
to which as he said all possibl danc could be danc and thei felt

young nichola now a slim lad of fifteen delic and intellig
with curli lightbrown hair and beauti ey wa delight becaus
uncl pierr as he call him wa the object of hi raptur and
passion affect no on had instil into him thi love for pierr
whom he saw onli occasion countess mari who had brought him up
had done her utmost to make him love her husband as she love him and
littl nichola did love hi uncl but love him with just a shade of
contempt pierr howev he ador he did not want to be an hussar or
a knight of st georg like hi uncl nichola he want to be learn
wise and kind like pierr in pierr presenc hi face alwai shone
with pleasur and he flush and wa breathless when pierr spoke to
him he did not miss a singl word he utter and would afterward
with dessal or by himself recal and reconsid the mean of
everyth pierr had said pierr past life and hi unhappi prior
to 1812 of which young nichola had form a vagu poetic pictur from
some word he had overheard hi adventur in moscow hi captiv
platn karatev of whom he had heard from pierr hi love for natsha
of whom the lad wa also particularli fond and especi pierr
friendship with the father whom nichola could not rememberal thi
made pierr in hi ey a hero and a saint
from broken remark about natsha and hi father from the emot with
which pierr spoke of that dead father and from the care rever
tender with which natsha spoke of him the boi who wa onli just
begin to guess what love is deriv the notion that hi father had
love natsha and when dy had left her to hi friend but the father
whom the boi did not rememb appear to him a divin who could not
be pictur and of whom he never thought without a swell heart and
tear of sad and raptur so the boi also wa happi that pierr had
arriv
the guest welcom pierr becaus he alwai help to enliven and unit
ani compani he wa in
the grownup member of the famili not to mention hi wife were
pleas to have back a friend whose presenc made life run more smoothli

the old ladi were pleas with the present he brought them and
especi that natsha would now be herself again
pierr felt the differ outlook of these variou world and made
hast to satisfi all their expect
though the most absentmind and forget of men pierr with the aid
of a list hi wife drew up had now bought everyth not forget
hi motherand brotherinlaw commiss nor the dress materi for
a present to belva nor toi for hi wife nephew in the earli dai
of hi marriag it had seem strang to him that hi wife should expect
him not to forget to procur all the thing he undertook to bui and he
had been taken aback by her seriou annoy when on hi first trip he
forgot everyth but in time he grew us to thi demand know that
natsha ask noth for herself and gave him commiss for other
onli when he himself had offer to undertak them he now found an
unexpect and childlik pleasur in thi purchas of present for
everyon in the hous and never forgot anyth if he now incur
natsha censur it wa onli for bui too mani and too expens
thing to her other defect as most peopl thought them but which
to pierr were qualiti of untidi and neglect of herself she now
ad stingi
from the time that pierr began life as a famili man on a foot
entail heavi expenditur he had notic to hi surpris that he
spent onli half as much as befor and that hi affairswhich had been
in disord of late chiefli becaus of hi first wife debtshad begun
to improv
life wa cheaper becaus it wa circumscrib that most expens
luxuri the kind of life that can be chang at ani moment wa no
longer hi nor did he wish for it he felt that hi wai of life had now
been settl onc for all till death and that to chang it wa not in
hi power and so that wai of life prove econom
with a merri smile face pierr wa sort hi purchas
what do you think of thi said he unrol a piec of stuff like a
shopman
natsha who wa sit opposit to him with her eldest daughter on her
lap turn her sparkl ey swiftli from her husband to the thing he

i take littl msha into societi perhap thei will be fashion again
by then well let go now
and collect the present thei went first to the nurseri and then to
the old countess room
the countess wa sit with her companion belva plai
grandpati as usual when pierr and natsha came into the draw
room with parcel under their arm
the countess wa now over sixti wa quit grai and wore a cap with a
frill that surround her face her face had shrivel her upper lip
had sunk in and her ey were dim
after the death of her son and husband in such rapid success she
felt herself a be accident forgotten in thi world and left
without aim or object for her exist she at drank slept or kept
awak but did not live life gave her no new impress she want
noth from life but tranquil and that tranquil onli death
could give her but until death came she had to go on live that is
to us her vital forc a peculiar on see in veri young children
and veri old peopl wa particularli evid in her her life had
no extern aimsonli a need to exercis her variou function and
inclin wa appar she had to eat sleep think speak weep
work give vent to her anger and so on mere becaus she had a
stomach a brain muscl nerv and a liver she did these thing not
under ani extern impuls as peopl in the full vigor of life do
when behind the purpos for which thei strive that of exercis their
function remain unnot she talk onli becaus she physic
need to exercis her tongu and lung she cri as a child doe
becaus her nose had to be clear and so on what for peopl in their
full vigor is an aim wa for her evid mere a pretext
thu in the morningespeci if she had eaten anyth rich the dai
beforesh felt a need of be angri and would choos as the handiest
pretext belva deaf
she would begin to sai someth to her in a low tone from the other end
of the room
it seem a littl warmer todai my dear she would murmur
and when belva repli oh ye theyv come she would mutter
angrili o lord how stupid and deaf she is
anoth pretext would be her snuff which would seem too dry or too damp
or not rub fine enough after these fit of irrit her face
would grow yellow and her maid knew by infal symptom when belva
would again be deaf the snuff damp and the countess face yellow just
as she need to work off her spleen so she had sometim to exercis
her stillexist faculti of thinkingand the pretext for that wa a
game of patienc when she need to cry the deceas count would be
the pretext when she want to be agit nichola and hi health
would be the pretext and when she felt a need to speak spitefulli the
pretext would be countess mari when her vocal organ need exercis
which wa usual toward seven oclock when she had had an afterdinn
rest in a darken room the pretext would be the retel of the same
stori over and over again to the same audienc
the old ladi condit wa understood by the whole household though no
on ever spoke of it and thei all made everi possibl effort to satisfi
her need onli by a rare glanc exchang with a sad smile
between nichola pierr natsha and countess mari wa the common
understand of her condit express
but those glanc express someth more thei said that she had
plai her part in life that what thei now saw wa not her whole self
that we must all becom like her and that thei were glad to yield to
her to restrain themselv for thi onc preciou be formerli as
full of life as themselv but now so much to be piti memento
mori said these glanc
onli the realli heartless the stupid on of that household and the
littl children fail to understand thi and avoid her

everi now and then and mutter someth to himself and evid
experienc a new and power emot as he turn hi curli head
with hi thin neck expos by hi turndown collar toward the place
where pierr sat
the convers turn on the contemporari gossip about those in power
in which most peopl see the chief interest of home polit densov
dissatisfi with the govern on account of hi own disappoint
in the servic heard with pleasur of the thing done in petersburg
which seem to him stupid and made forcibl and sharp comment on what
pierr told them
on us to have to be a germannow on must danc with tatwinova
and madam kwdener and wead eckatshausen and the bwethwen oh thei
should let that fine fellow bonapart looseh knock all thi nonsens
out of them fanci give the command of the semnov wegiment to a
fellow like that schwatz he cri
nichola though free from densov readi to find fault with
everyth also thought that discuss of the govern wa a veri
seriou and weighti matter and the fact that a had been appoint
minist of thi and b governor gener of that and that the emperor
had said soandso and thi minist soandso seem to him veri
import and so he thought it necessari to take an interest in these
thing and to question pierr the question put by these two kept the
convers from chang it ordinari charact of gossip about the
higher govern circl
but natsha know all her husband wai and idea saw that he had
long been wish but had been unabl to divert the convers to
anoth channel and express hi own deepli felt idea for the sake of
which he had gone to petersburg to consult with hi new friend princ
theodor and she help him by ask how hi affair with princ
theodor had gone
what wa it about ask nichola
alwai the same thing said pierr look round at hi listen
everybodi see that thing ar go so badli that thei cannot be
allow to go on so and that it is the duti of all decent men to
counteract it as far as thei can
what can decent men do nichola inquir frown slightli what
can be done
why thi
come into my studi said nichola
natsha who had long expect to be fetch to nurs her babi now
heard the nurs call her and went to the nurseri countess mari
follow her the men went into the studi and littl nichola bolknski
follow them unnot by hi uncl and sat down at the write tabl
in a shadi corner by the window
well what would you do ask densov
alwai some fantast scheme said nichola
why thi began pierr not sit down but pace the room
sometim stop short gesticul and lisp the posit
in petersburg is thi the emperor doe not look into anyth he
ha abandon himself altogeth to thi mystic pierr could not
toler mystic in anyon now he seek onli for peac and onli
these peopl san foi ni loi can give it himpeopl who recklessli
hack at and strangl everythingmagntski arakchev and tutti
quanti you will agre that if you did not look after your estat
yourself but onli want a quiet life the harsher your steward wa the
more readili your object might be attain he said to nichola
without faith or law
well what doe that lead up to said nichola
well everyth is go to ruin robberi in the law court in the
armi noth but flog drill and militari settlement the
peopl ar tortur enlighten is suppress all that is young and
honest is crush everyon see that thi cannot go on everyth is
strain to such a degre that it will certainli break said pierr as
those who examin the action of ani govern have alwai said sinc
govern began i told them just on thing in petersburg
told whom
well you know whom said pierr with a mean glanc from under
hi brow princ theodor and all those to encourag cultur and
philanthropi is all veri well of cours the aim is excel but in the
present circumst someth els is need
at that moment nichola notic the presenc of hi nephew hi face
darken and he went up to the boi
why ar you here
why let him be said pierr take nichola by the arm and
continu that is not enough i told them someth els is need
when you stand expect the overstrain string to snap at ani moment
when everyon is expect the inevit catastroph as mani as
possibl must join hand as close as thei can to withstand the gener
calam everyth that is young and strong is be entic awai and
deprav on is lure by women anoth by honor a third by ambit
or monei and thei go over to that camp no independ men such as you
or i ar left what i sai is widen the scope of our societi let the
mot dordr be not virtu alon but independ and action as well
nichola who had left hi nephew irrit push up an armchair sat
down in it and listen to pierr cough discontentedli and frown
more and more
but action with what aim he cri and what posit will you adopt
toward the govern
why the posit of assist the societi need not be secret if the
govern allow it not mere is it not hostil to govern but
it is a societi of true conservativesa societi of gentlemen in the full
mean of that word it is onli to prevent some pugachv or other from
kill my children and your and arakchev from send me off to some
militari settlement we join hand onli for the public welfar and the
gener safeti
ye but it a secret societi and therefor a hostil and harm on
which can onli caus harm
why did the tugendbund which save europ thei did not then ventur
to suggest that russia had save europ do ani harm the tugendbund
is an allianc of virtu it is love mutual help it is what christ
preach on the cross
natsha who had come in dure the convers look joyfulli at
her husband it wa not what he wa sai that pleas herthat did not
even interest her for it seem to her that wa all extrem simpl
and that she had known it a long time it seem so to her becaus she
knew that it sprang from pierr whole soul but it wa hi anim
and enthusiast appear that made her glad
the boi with the thin neck stretch out from the turndown collarwhom
everyon had forgottengaz at pierr with even greater and more
raptur joi everi word of pierr burn into hi heart and with a
nervou movement of hi finger he unconsci broke the seal wax
and quill pen hi hand came upon on hi uncl tabl
it is not at all what you suppos but that is what the german
tugendbund wa and what i am propos
no my fwiend the tugendbund is all vewi well for the sausag eater
but i dont understand it and cant even pwonounc it interpos
densov in a loud and resolut voic i agwe that evewyth here is
wotten and howwibl but the tugendbund i dont understand if were
not satisfi let us have a bunt of our own that all wight je sui
vote homm
im your man
pierr smile natsha began to laugh but nichola knit hi brow
still more and began prove to pierr that there wa no prospect of
ani great chang and that all the danger he spoke of exist onli in hi
imagin pierr maintain the contrari and as hi mental faculti
were greater and more resourc nichola felt himself corner thi
made him still angrier for he wa fulli convinc not by reason
but by someth within him stronger than reason of the justic of hi
opinion
i will tell you thi he said rise and try with nervous
twitch finger to prop up hi pipe in a corner but final
abandon the attempt i cant prove it to you you sai that
everyth here is rotten and that an overthrow is come i dont
see it but you also sai that our oath of allegi is a condit
matter and to that i repli you ar my best friend as you know
but if you form a secret societi and began work against the
governmentb it what it mayi know it is my duti to obei the
govern and if arakchev order me to lead a squadron against you
and cut you down i should not hesit an instant but should do it
and you mai argu about that as you like
an awkward silenc follow these word natsha wa the first to speak
defend her husband and attack her brother her defens wa weak
and inapt but she attain her object the convers wa resum and
no longer in the unpleasantli hostil tone of nichola last remark
when thei all got up to go in to supper littl nichola bolknski went
up to pierr pale and with shine radiant ey
uncl pierr you no if papa were aliv would he agre with
you he ask
and pierr suddenli realiz what a special independ complex and
power process of thought and feel must have been go on in
thi boi dure that convers and rememb all he had said he
regret that the lad should have heard him he had howev to give
him an answer
ye i think so he said reluctantli and left the studi
the lad look down and seem now for the first time to notic what he
had done to the thing on the tabl he flush and went up to nichola
uncl forgiv me i did that unintention he said point to
the broken seal wax and pen
nichola start angrili
all right all right he said throw the bit under the tabl
and evid suppress hi vexat with difficulti he turn awai
from the boi
you ought not to have been here at all he said
chapter xv
the convers at supper wa not about polit or societi but
turn on the subject nichola like bestrecollect of 1812 densov
start these and pierr wa particularli agreeabl and amus about
them the famili separ on the most friendli term
after supper nichola have undress in hi studi and given
instruct to the steward who had been wait for him went to the
bedroom in hi dress gown where he found hi wife still at her
tabl write
what ar you write mari nichola ask
countess mari blush she wa afraid that what she wa write would
not be understood or approv by her husband
she had want to conceal what she wa write from him but at the same
time wa glad he had surpris her at it and that she would now have to
tell him
a diari nichola she repli hand him a blue exercis book
fill with her firm bold write
a diari nichola repeat with a shade of ironi and he took up the
book
it wa in french
decemb 4 todai when andrsha her eldest boi woke up he did not
wish to dress and mademoisel louis sent for me he wa naughti and
obstin i tri threat but he onli grew angrier then i took the
matter in hand i left him alon and began with nurs help to get the
other children up tell him that i did not love him for a long time
he wa silent as if astonish then he jump out of bed ran to me in
hi shirt and sob so that i could not calm him for a long time
it wa plain that what troubl him most wa that he had griev me
afterward in the even when i gave him hi ticket he again began
cry piteous and kiss me on can do anyth with him by
tender
what is a ticket nichola inquir
i have begun give the elder on mark everi even show how
thei have behav
nichola look into the radiant ey that were gaze at him and
continu to turn over the page and read in the diari wa set down
everyth in the children live that seem noteworthi to their
mother as show their charact or suggest gener reflect
on educ method thei were for the most part quit insignific
trifl but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either now
that he read thi diari about hi children for the first time
under the date 5 wa enter
mtya wa naughti at tabl papa said he wa to have no pud he had
none but look so unhappili and greedili at the other while thei were

develop their greedi must tell nichola thi
nichola put down the book and look at hi wife the radiant ey
gaze at him questioningli would he approv or disapprov of her
diari there could be no doubt not onli of hi approv but also of hi
admir for hi wife
perhap it need not be done so pedant thought nichola or even
done at all but thi untir continu spiritu effort of which the
sole aim wa the children moral welfar delight him had nichola
been abl to analyz hi feel he would have found that hi steadi
tender and proud love of hi wife rest on hi feel of wonder at
her spiritu and at the lofti moral world almost beyond hi reach
in which she had her be
he wa proud of her intellig and good recogn hi own
insignific besid her in the spiritu world and rejoic all the
more that she with such a soul not onli belong to him but wa part of
himself
i quit quit approv my dearest said he with a signific look
and after a short paus he ad and i behav badli todai you

medensov and natsha natsha is absurd how she rule over him and
yet there need onli be a discuss and she ha no word of her own
but onli repeat hi sai ad nichola yield to that
irresist inclin which tempt us to judg those nearest and
dearest to us he forgot that what he wa sai about natsha could
have been appli word for word to himself in relat to hi wife

when i told him that duti and the oath were abov everyth he

everybodi is suffer tortur and be corrupt and that it
is our duti to help our neighbor of cours he is right there said
countess mari but he forget that we have other duti nearer to us

ourselv to risk we must not risk our children

countess mari want to tell him that man doe not live by bread alon
and that he attach too much import to these matter but she knew
she must not sai thi and that it would be useless to do so she onli
took hi hand and kiss it he took thi as a sign of approv and

countess mari listen to her husband and understood all that he told
her she knew that when he thought aloud in thi wai he would sometim
ask her what he had been sai and be vex if he notic that she
had been think about someth els but she had to forc herself to
attend for what he wa sai did not interest her at all she look
at him and did not think but felt about someth differ she felt
a submiss tender love for thi man who would never understand all
that she understood and thi seem to make her love for him still
stronger and ad a touch of passion tender besid thi
feel which absorb her altogeth and hinder her from follow
the detail of her husband plan thought that had no connect with
what he wa sai flit through her mind she thought of her nephew
her husband account of the boi agit while pierr wa speak
struck her forcibl and variou trait of hi gentl sensit
charact recur to her mind and while think of her nephew she
thought also of her own children she did not compar them with him but
compar her feel for them with her feel for him and felt
with regret that there wa someth lack in her feel for young
nichola
sometim it seem to her that thi differ aros from the

second epilogu
chapter i
histori is the life of nation and of human to seiz and put into
word to describ directli the life of human or even of a singl
nation appear imposs
the ancient historian all emploi on and the same method to describ
and seiz the appar elusiveth life of a peopl thei describ
the activ of individu who rule the peopl and regard the
activ of those men as repres the activ of the whole nation
the question how did individu make nation act as thei wish and by
what wa the will of these individu themselv guid the ancient
met by recogn a divin which subject the nation to the will of
a chosen man and guid the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish
end that were predestin
for the ancient these question were solv by a belief in the direct
particip of the deiti in human affair
modern histori in theori reject both these principl
it would seem that have reject the belief of the ancient in man
subject to the deiti and in a predetermin aim toward which nation
ar led modern histori should studi not the manifest of power but
the caus that produc it but modern histori ha not done thi have
in theori reject the view held by the ancient it still follow them
in practic
instead of men endow with divin author and directli guid by
the will of god modern histori ha given us either hero endow with
extraordinari superhuman capac or simpli men of veri variou
kind from monarch to journalist who lead the mass instead of the
former divin appoint aim of the jewish greek or roman nation
which ancient historian regard as repres the progress of
human modern histori ha postul it own aimsth welfar of the
french german or english peopl or in it highest abstract the
welfar and civil of human in gener by which is usual
meant that of the peopl occupi a small northwesterli portion of a
larg contin
modern histori ha reject the belief of the ancient without
replac them by a new concept and the logic of the situat ha
oblig the historian after thei had appar reject the divin
author of the king and the fate of the ancient to reach the same
conclus by anoth road that is to recogn 1 nation guid
by individu men and 2 the exist of a known aim to which these
nation and human at larg ar tend
at the basi of the work of all the modern historian from gibbon to
buckl despit their seem disagr and the appar novelti of
their outlook lie those two old unavoid assumpt
in the first place the historian describ the activ of individu
who in hi opinion have direct human on historian consid
onli monarch gener and minist as be such men while anoth
includ also orat learn men reform philosoph and poet
secondli it is assum that the goal toward which human is be led
is known to the historian to on of them thi goal is the great of
the roman spanish or french realm to anoth it is liberti equal
and a certain kind of civil of a small corner of the world call
europ
in 1789 a ferment aris in pari it grow spread and is express
by a movement of peopl from west to east sever time it move
eastward and collid with a countermov from the east westward
in 1812 it reach it extrem limit moscow and then with remark
symmetri a countermov occur from east to west attract to
it as the first movement had done the nation of middl europ the
counter movement reach the start point of the first movement in the
westparisand subsid
dure that twentyyear period an immens number of field were left
until hous were burn trade chang it direct million
of men migrat were impoverish or were enrich and million
of christian men profess the law of love of their fellow slew on
anoth
what doe all thi mean why did it happen what made those peopl burn
hous and slai their fellow men what were the caus of these event
what forc made men act so these ar the instinct plain and
most legitim question human ask itself when it encount the
monument and tradit of that period
for a repli to these question the common sens of mankind turn to the
scienc of histori whose aim is to enabl nation and human to know
themselv
if histori had retain the concept of the ancient it would have
said that god to reward or punish hi peopl gave napoleon power and
direct hi will to the fulfil of the divin end and that repli
would have been clear and complet on might believ or disbeliev
in the divin signific of napoleon but for anyon believ in
it there would have been noth unintellig in the histori of that
period nor would there have been ani contradict
but modern histori cannot give that repli scienc doe not admit the
concept of the ancient as to the direct particip of the deiti
in human affair and therefor histori ought to give other answer
modern histori repli to these question sai you want to know what
thi movement mean what caus it and what forc produc these
event then listen
loui xiv wa a veri proud and selfconfid man he had such and such
mistress and such and such minist and he rule franc badli hi
descend were weak men and thei too rule franc badli and thei had
such and such favorit and such and such mistress moreov certain
men wrote some book at that time at the end of the eighteenth centuri
there were a coupl of dozen men in pari who began to talk about all
men be free and equal thi caus peopl all over franc to begin
to slash at and drown on anoth thei kill the king and mani other
peopl at that time there wa in franc a man of geniusnapoleon he
conquer everybodi everywherethat is he kill mani peopl becaus
he wa a great geniu and for some reason he went to kill african and
kill them so well and wa so cun and wise that when he return to
franc he order everybodi to obei him and thei all obei him have
becom an emperor he again went out to kill peopl in itali austria
and prussia and there too he kill a great mani in russia there
wa an emperor alexand who decid to restor order in europ and
therefor fought against napoleon in 1807 he suddenli made friend
with him but in 1811 thei again quarrel and again began kill mani
peopl napoleon led six hundr thousand men into russia and captur
moscow then he suddenli ran awai from moscow and the emperor
alexand help by the advic of stein and other unit europ to
arm against the disturb of it peac all napoleon alli suddenli
becam hi enemi and their forc advanc against the fresh forc he
rais the alli defeat napoleon enter pari forc napoleon to
abdic and sent him to the island of elba not depriv him of the
titl of emperor and show him everi respect though five year befor
and on year later thei all regard him as an outlaw and a brigand
then loui xviii who till then had been the laughingstock both of the
french and the alli began to reign and napoleon shed tear
befor hi old guard renounc the throne and went into exil then
the skill statesmen and diplomatist especi talleyrand who
manag to sit down in a particular chair befor anyon els and
therebi extend the frontier of franc talk in vienna and by
these convers made the nation happi or unhappi suddenli the
diplomatist and monarch nearli quarrel and were on the point of
again order their armi to kill on anoth but just then napoleon
arriv in franc with a battalion and the french who had been hate
him immedi all submit to him but the alli monarch were
angri at thi and went to fight the french onc more and thei defeat
the geniu napoleon and suddenli recogn him as a brigand sent him
to the island of st helena and the exil separ from the belov
franc so dear to hi heart di a linger death on that rock and
bequeath hi great deed to poster but in europ a reaction
occur and the sovereign onc again all began to oppress their
subject
it would be a mistak to think that thi is ironica caricatur of the
histor account on the contrari it is a veri mild express of
the contradictori repli not meet the question which all the
historian give from the compil of memoir and the histori
of separ state to the writer of gener histori and the new
histori of the cultur of that period
the strang and absurd of these repli aris from the fact that
modern histori like a deaf man answer question no on ha ask
if the purpos of histori be to give a descript of the movement of
human and of the peopl the first questionin the absenc of a
repli to which all the rest will be incomprehensiblei what is the
power that move peopl to thi modern histori labori repli
either that napoleon wa a great geniu or that loui xiv wa veri
proud or that certain writer wrote certain book
all that mai be so and mankind is readi to agre with it but it is not
what wa ask all that would be interest if we recogn a divin
power base on itself and alwai consist direct it nation
through napoleon louis and writer but we do not acknowledg such
a power and therefor befor speak about napoleon louis and
author we ought to be shown the connect exist between these men
and the movement of the nation
if instead of a divin power some other forc ha appear it should
be explain in what thi new forc consist for the whole interest of
histori li precis in that forc
histori seem to assum that thi forc is selfevid and known to
everyon but in spite of everi desir to regard it as known anyon
read mani histor work cannot help doubt whether thi new
forc so various understood by the historian themselv is realli
quit well known to everybodi
chapter ii
what forc move the nation
biograph historian and historian of separ nation understand
thi forc as a power inher in hero and ruler in their narrat
event occur sole by the will of a napoleon and alexand or in
gener of the person thei describ the answer given by thi kind
of historian to the question of what forc caus event to happen ar
satisfactori onli as long as there is but on historian to each event
as soon as historian of differ nation and tendenc begin
to describ the same event the repli thei give immedi lose all
mean for thi forc is understood by them all not onli differ
but often in quit contradictori wai on historian sai that an
event wa produc by napoleon power anoth that it wa produc by
alexand a third that it wa due to the power of some other person
besid thi historian of that kind contradict each other even
in their statement as to the forc on which the author of some
particular person wa base thier a bonapartist sai that napoleon
power wa base on hi virtu and geniu lanfrei a republican sai it
wa base on hi trickeri and decept of the peopl so the historian
of thi class by mutual destroi on anoth posit destroi
the understand of the forc which produc event and furnish no
repli to histori essenti question
writer of univers histori who deal with all the nation seem to
recogn how erron is the specialist historian view of the forc
which produc event thei do not recogn it as a power inher in
hero and ruler but as the result of a multipl of various
direct forc in describ a war or the subjug of a peopl a
gener historian look for the caus of the event not in the power
of on man but in the interact of mani person connect with the
event
accord to thi view the power of histor personag repres
as the product of mani forc can no longer it would seem be regard
as a forc that itself produc event yet in most case univers
historian still emploi the concept of power as a forc that itself
produc event and treat it as their caus in their exposit an
histor charact is first the product of hi time and hi power onli
the result of variou forc and then hi power is itself a forc
produc event gervinu schlosser and other for instanc at on
time prove napoleon to be a product of the revolut of the idea of
1789 and so forth and at anoth plainli sai that the campaign of 1812
and other thing thei do not like were simpli the product of napoleon
misdirect will and that the veri idea of 1789 were arrest in their
develop by napoleon capric the idea of the revolut and the
gener temper of the ag produc napoleon power but napoleon
power suppress the idea of the revolut and the gener temper of
the ag
thi curiou contradict is not accident not onli doe it occur at
everi step but the univers historian account ar all made up of
a chain of such contradict thi contradict occur becaus after
enter the field of analysi the univers historian stop halfwai
to find compon forc equal to the composit or result forc the
sum of the compon must equal the result thi condit is never
observ by the univers historian and so to explain the result
forc thei ar oblig to admit in addit to the insuffici
compon anoth unexplain forc affect the result action
specialist historian describ the campaign of 1813 or the restor
of the bourbon plainli assert that these event were produc by the
will of alexand but the univers historian gervinu refut thi
opinion of the specialist historian tri to prove that the campaign of
1813 and the restor of the bourbon were due to other thing besid
alexand willsuch as the activ of stein metternich madam de
stal talleyrand ficht chateaubriand and other the historian
evid decompos alexand power into the compon talleyrand
chateaubriand and the restbut the sum of the compon that is
the interact of chateaubriand talleyrand madam de stal and the
other evid doe not equal the result name the phenomenon
of million of frenchmen submit to the bourbon that chateaubriand
madam de stal and other spoke certain word to on anoth onli
affect their mutual relat but doe not account for the submiss
of million and therefor to explain how from these relat of their
the submiss of million of peopl resultedthat is how compon
forc equal to on a gave a result equal to a thousand time ath
historian is again oblig to fall back on powerth forc he had
deniedand to recogn it as the result of the forc that is he
ha to admit an unexplain forc act on the result and that is
just what the univers historian do and consequ thei not onli
contradict the specialist historian but contradict themselv
peasant have no clear idea of the caus of rain sai accord to
whether thei want rain or fine weather the wind ha blown the cloud
awai or the wind ha brought up the cloud and in the same wai the
univers historian sometim when it pleas them and fit in with
their theori sai that power is the result of event and sometim
when thei want to prove someth els sai that power produc event
a third class of historiansth socal historian of
culturefollow the path laid down by the univers historian who
sometim accept writer and ladi as forc produc eventsagain
take that forc to be someth quit differ thei see it in what is
call culturein mental activ
the historian of cultur ar quit consist in regard to their
progenitor the writer of univers histori for if histor
event mai be explain by the fact that certain person treat on
anoth in such and such wai why not explain them by the fact that
such and such peopl wrote such and such book of the immens number of
indic accompani everi vital phenomenon these historian select
the indic of intellectu activ and sai that thi indic is
the caus but despit their endeavor to prove that the caus of event
li in intellectu activ onli by a great stretch can on admit
that there is ani connect between intellectu activ and the
movement of peopl and in no case can on admit that intellectu
activ control peopl action for that view is not confirm by
such fact as the veri cruel murder of the french revolut result
from the doctrin of the equal of man or the veri cruel war and
execut result from the preach of love
but even admit as correct all the cunningli devis argument with
which these histori ar filledadmit that nation ar govern by
some undefin forc call an ideahistori essenti question still
remain unansw and to the former power of monarch and to the
influenc of advis and other peopl introduc by the univers
historian anoth newer forceth ideai ad the connect of
which with the mass need explan it is possibl to understand
that napoleon had power and so event occur with some effort on mai
even conceiv that napoleon togeth with other influenc wa the caus
of an event but how a book le contrat social had the effect of make
frenchmen begin to drown on anoth cannot be understood without an
explan of the causal nexu of thi new forc with the event
undoubtedli some relat exist between all who live contemporan
and so it is possibl to find some connect between the intellectu
activ of men and their histor movement just as such a
connect mai be found between the movement of human and commerc
handicraft garden or anyth els you pleas but why intellectu
activ is consid by the historian of cultur to be the caus or
express of the whole histor movement is hard to understand
onli the follow consider can have led the historian to such
a conclus 1 that histori is written by learn men and so it is
natur and agreeabl for them to think that the activ of their class
suppli the basi of the movement of all human just as a similar
belief is natur and agreeabl to trader agriculturist and soldier
if thei do not express it that is mere becaus trader and soldier
do not write histori and 2 that spiritu activ enlighten
civil cultur idea ar all indistinct indefinit concept
under whose banner it is veri easi to us word have a still less
definit mean and which can therefor be readili introduc into ani
theori
but not to speak of the intrins qualiti of histori of thi kind
which mai possibl even be of us to someon for someth the
histori of cultur to which all gener histori tend more and more
to approxim ar signific from the fact that after serious
and minut examin variou religi philosoph and polit
doctrin as caus of event as soon as thei have to describ an
actual histor event such as the campaign of 1812 for instanc thei
involuntarili describ it as result from an exercis of powerand sai
plainli that that wa the result of napoleon will speak so the
historian of cultur involuntarili contradict themselv and show that
the new forc thei have devis doe not account for what happen in
histori and that histori can onli be explain by introduc a power
which thei appar do not recogn
chapter iii
a locomot is move someon ask what move it a peasant sai
the devil move it anoth man sai the locomot move becaus it
wheel go round a third assert that the caus of it movement li in
the smoke which the wind carri awai
the peasant is irrefut he ha devis a complet explan to
refut him someon would have to prove to him that there is no devil
or anoth peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil
but a german who move the locomot onli then as a result of the
contradict will thei see that thei ar both wrong but the man who
sai that the movement of the wheel is the caus refut himself for
have onc begun to analyz he ought to go on and explain further why
the wheel go round and till he ha reach the ultim caus of the
movement of the locomot in the pressur of steam in the boiler he
ha no right to stop in hi search for the caus the man who explain
the movement of the locomot by the smoke that is carri back ha
notic that the wheel do not suppli an explan and ha taken the
first sign that occur to him and in hi turn ha offer that as an
explan
the onli concept that can explain the movement of the locomot is
that of a forc commensur with the movement observ
the onli concept that can explain the movement of the peopl is that
of some forc commensur with the whole movement of the peopl
yet to suppli thi concept variou historian take forc of
differ kind all of which ar incommensur with the movement
observ some see it as a forc directli inher in hero as the
peasant see the devil in the locomot other as a forc result
from sever other forc like the movement of the wheel other again
as an intellectu influenc like the smoke that is blown awai
so long as histori ar written of separ individu whether
caesar alexand luther or voltair and not the histori
of all absolut all those who take part in an event it is quit
imposs to describ the movement of human without the concept
of a forc compel men to direct their activ toward a certain end
and the onli such concept known to historian is that of power
thi concept is the on handl by mean of which the materi of
histori as at present expound can be dealt with and anyon who
break that handl off as buckl did without find some other method
of treat histor materi mere depriv himself of the on
possibl wai of deal with it the necess of the concept of
power as an explan of histor event is best demonstr by
the univers historian and historian of cultur themselv for thei
professedli reject that concept but inevit have recours to it at
everi step
in deal with human inquiri the scienc of histori up to now
is like monei in circulationpap monei and coin the biographi and
special nation histori ar like paper monei thei can be us and
can circul and fulfil their purpos without harm to anyon and even
advantag as long as no on ask what is the secur behind them
you need onli forget to ask how the will of hero produc event and
such histori as thier will be interest and instruct and mai
perhap even possess a ting of poetri but just as doubt of the real
valu of paper monei aris either becaus be easi to make too much
of it get made or becaus peopl try to exchang it for gold so also
doubt concern the real valu of such histori aris either becaus
too mani of them ar written or becaus in hi simplic of heart
someon inquir by what forc did napoleon do thisthat is want
to exchang the current paper monei for the real gold of actual
comprehens
the writer of univers histori and of the histori of cultur ar
like peopl who recogn the defect of paper monei decid to
substitut for it monei made of metal that ha not the specif graviti

that paper monei mai deceiv the ignor but nobodi is deceiv by
token of base metal that have no valu but mere jingl as gold is
gold onli if it is servic not mere for exchang but also for us
so univers historian will be valuabl onli when thei can repli to

give contradictori repli to that question while the historian of
cultur evad it and answer someth quit differ and as counter
of imit gold can be us onli among a group of peopl who agre to
accept them as gold or among those who do not know the natur of

human essenti question serv as currenc for some purpos of

chapter iv
have abandon the concept of the ancient as to the divin
subject of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subject
of that man will to the deiti histori cannot without contradict
take a singl step till it ha chosen on of two thing either a return
to the former belief in the direct intervent of the deiti in human
affair or a definit explan of the mean of the forc produc
histor event and term power
a return to the first is imposs the belief ha been destroi and
so it is essenti to explain what is meant by power
napoleon order an armi to be rais and go to war we ar so
accustom to that idea and have becom so us to it that the question
why did six hundr thousand men go to fight when napoleon utter
certain word seem to us senseless he had the power and so what he
order wa done
thi repli is quit satisfactori if we believ that the power wa given
him by god but as soon as we do not admit that it becom essenti to
determin what is thi power of on man over other
it cannot be the direct physic power of a strong man over a weak onea
domin base on the applic or threat of physic forc like
the power of hercul nor can it be base on the effect of moral forc
as in their simplic some historian think who sai that the lead
figur in histori ar hero that is men gift with a special
strength of soul and mind call geniu thi power cannot be base on
the predomin of moral strength for not to mention hero such as
napoleon about whose moral qualiti opinion differ wide histori
show us that neither a loui xi nor a metternich who rule over
million of peopl had ani particular moral qualiti but on the
contrari were gener moral weaker than ani of the million thei
rule over
if the sourc of power li neither in the physic nor in the moral
qualiti of him who possess it it must evid be look for
elsewherein the relat to the peopl of the man who wield the power
and that is how power is understood by the scienc of jurisprud
that exchang bank of histori which offer to exchang histori
understand of power for true gold
power is the collect will of the peopl transfer by express or
tacit consent to their chosen ruler
in the domain of jurisprud which consist of discuss of how a
state and power might be arrang were it possibl for all that to
be arrang it is all veri clear but when appli to histori that
definit of power need explan
the scienc of jurisprud regard the state and power as the ancient
regard firenam as someth exist absolut but for histori
the state and power ar mere phenomena just as for modern physic
fire is not an element but a phenomenon
from thi fundament differ between the view held by histori and
that held by jurisprud it follow that jurisprud can tell
minut how in it opinion power should be constitut and what
powerexist immut outsid timei but to histori question
about the mean of the mutat of power in time it can answer
noth
if power be the collect will of the peopl transfer to their
ruler wa pugachv a repres of the will of the peopl if not
then why wa napoleon i why wa napoleon iii a crimin when he wa
taken prison at boulogn and why later on were those crimin whom
he arrest
do palac revolutionsin which sometim onli two or three peopl take
parttransf the will of the peopl to a new ruler in intern
relat is the will of the peopl also transfer to their
conqueror wa the will of the confeder of the rhine transfer
to napoleon in 1806 wa the will of the russian peopl transfer
to napoleon in 1809 when our armi in allianc with the french went to
fight the austrian
to these question three answer ar possibl
either to assum 1 that the will of the peopl is alwai
uncondition transfer to the ruler or ruler thei have chosen and
that therefor everi emerg of a new power everi struggl
against the power onc appoint should be absolut regard as an
infring of the real power or 2 that the will of the peopl
is transfer to the ruler condition under definit and known
condit and to show that all limit conflict and even
destruct of power result from a nonobserv by the ruler of the
condit under which their power wa entrust to them or 3 that
the will of the peopl is deleg to the ruler condition but
that the condit ar unknown and indefinit and that the appear
of sever author their struggl and their fall result sole
from the greater or lesser fulfil by the ruler of these unknown
condit on which the will of the peopl is transfer from some
peopl to other
and these ar the three wai in which the historian do explain the
relat of the peopl to their ruler
some historiansthos biograph and specialist historian alreadi
refer toin their simplic fail to understand the question of
the mean of power seem to consid that the collect will of
the peopl is uncondition transfer to histor person and
therefor when describ some singl state thei assum that particular
power to be the on absolut and real power and that ani other forc
oppos thi is not a power but a violat of powermer violenc
their theori suitabl for primit and peac period of histori
ha the inconveniencein applic to complex and stormi period in
the life of nation dure which variou power aris simultan and
struggl with on anotherthat a legitimist historian will prove
that the nation convent the directori and bonapart were mere
infring of the true power while a republican and a bonapartist will
prove the on that the convent and the other that the empir wa the
real power and that all the other were violat of power
evid the explan furnish by these historian be mutual
contradictori can onli satisfi young children
recogn the falsiti of thi view of histori anoth set of
historian sai that power rest on a condit deleg of the will
of the peopl to their ruler and that histor leader have power
onli condition on carri out the program that the will of the
peopl ha by tacit agreement prescrib to them but what thi program
consist in these historian do not sai or if thei do thei continu
contradict on anoth
each historian accord to hi view of what constitut a nation
progress look for these condit in the great wealth freedom
or enlighten of citizen of franc or some other countri but not
to mention the historian contradict as to the natur of thi
programor even admit that some on gener program of these
condit existsth fact of histori almost alwai contradict that
theori if the condit under which power is entrust consist in the
wealth freedom and enlighten of the peopl how is it that loui
xiv and ivn the terribl end their reign tranquilli while loui xvi
and charl i ar execut by their peopl to thi question historian
repli that loui xiv activ contrari to the program react on
loui xvi but why did it not react on loui xiv or on loui xvwhy
should it react just on loui xvi and what is the time limit for such
reaction to these question there ar and can be no answer equal
littl doe thi view explain why for sever centuri the collect
will is not withdrawn from certain ruler and their heir and
then suddenli dure a period of fifti year is transfer to the
convent to the directori to napoleon to alexand to loui xviii
to napoleon again to charl x to loui philipp to a republican
govern and to napoleon iii when explain these rapid transfer
of the peopl will from on individu to anoth especi in view
of intern relat conquest and allianc the historian ar
oblig to admit that some of these transfer ar not normal deleg
of the peopl will but ar accid depend on cun on
mistak on craft or on the weak of a diplomatist a ruler or a
parti leader so that the greater part of the event of historycivil
war revolut and conquestsar present by these historian
not as the result of free transfer of the peopl will but as
result of the illdirect will of on or more individu that is
onc again as usurp of power and so these historian also see
and admit histor event which ar except to the theori
these historian resembl a botanist who have notic that some
plant grow from seed produc two cotyledon should insist that all
that grow doe so by sprout into two leav and that the palm the
mushroom and even the oak which blossom into full growth and no longer
resembl two leav ar deviat from the theori
historian of the third class assum that the will of the peopl
is transfer to histor personag condition but that the
condit ar unknown to us thei sai that histor personag have
power onli becaus thei fulfil the will of the peopl which ha been
deleg to them
but in that case if the forc that move nation li not in the
histor leader but in the nation themselv what signific have
those leader
the leader these historian tell us express the will of the peopl
the activ of the leader repres the activ of the peopl
but in that case the question aris whether all the activ of the
leader serv as an express of the peopl will or onli some part
of it if the whole activ of the leader serv as the express of
the peopl will as some historian suppos then all the detail
of the court scandal contain in the biographi of a napoleon or
a catherin serv to express the life of the nation which is evid
nonsens but if it is onli some particular side of the activ of an
histor leader which serv to express the peopl life as other
socal philosoph historian believ then to determin which
side of the activ of a leader express the nation life we have
first of all to know in what the nation life consist
met by thi difficulti historian of that class devis some most
obscur impalp and gener abstract which can cover all
conceiv occurr and declar thi abstract to be the aim of
human movement the most usual gener adopt by almost
all the historian ar freedom equal enlighten progress
civil and cultur postul some gener as the goal
of the movement of human the historian studi the men of whom the
greatest number of monument have remain king minist gener
author reform pope and journalist to the extent to which in
their opinion these person have promot or hinder that abstract
but as it is in no wai prove that the aim of human doe consist in
freedom equal enlighten or civil and as the connect
of the peopl with the ruler and enlighten of human is onli base
on the arbitrari assumpt that the collect will of the peopl is
alwai transfer to the men whom we have notic it happen that the
activ of the million who migrat burn hous abandon agricultur
and destroi on anoth never is express in the account of the
activ of some dozen peopl who did not burn hous practic
agricultur or slai their fellow creatur
histori prove thi at everi turn is the ferment of the peopl of
the west at the end of the eighteenth centuri and their drive eastward
explain by the activ of loui xiv xv and xvi their mistress
and minist and by the live of napoleon rousseau diderot
beaumarchai and other
is the movement of the russian peopl eastward to kazn and siberia
express by detail of the morbid charact of ivn the terribl and by
hi correspond with krbski
is the movement of the peopl at the time of the crusad explain by
the life and activ of the godfrei and the louis and their ladi
for us that movement of the peopl from west to east without
leader with a crowd of vagrant and with peter the hermit remain
incomprehens and yet more incomprehens is the cessat of that
movement when a ration and sacr aim for the crusadeth deliver
of jerusalemhad been clearli defin by histor leader pope king
and knight incit the peopl to free the holi land but the peopl
did not go for the unknown caus which had previous impel them to
go no longer exist the histori of the godfrei and the minnesing
can evid not cover the life of the peopl and the histori of the
godfrei and the minnesing ha remain the histori of godfrei
and minnesing but the histori of the life of the peopl and their
impuls ha remain unknown
still less doe the histori of author and reform explain to us the
life of the peopl
the histori of cultur explain to us the impuls and condit of
life and thought of a writer or a reform we learn that luther had
a hot temper and said such and such thing we learn that rousseau wa
suspici and wrote such and such book but we do not learn why after
the reform the peopl massacr on anoth nor why dure the
french revolut thei guillotin on anoth
if we unit both these kind of histori as is done by the newest
historian we shall have the histori of monarch and writer but not
the histori of the life of the peopl
chapter v
the life of the nation is not contain in the live of a few men for
the connect between those men and the nation ha not been found
the theori that thi connect is base on the transfer of the
collect will of a peopl to certain histor personag is an
hypothesi unconfirm by the experi of histori
the theori of the transfer of the collect will of the peopl to
histor person mai perhap explain much in the domain of jurisprud
and be essenti for it purpos but in it applic to histori as
soon as revolut conquest or civil war occurthat is as soon as
histori beginsthat theori explain noth
the theori seem irrefut just becaus the act of transfer of the
peopl will cannot be verifi for it never occur
whatev happen and whoever mai stand at the head of affair the
theori can alwai sai that such and such a person took the lead becaus
the collect will wa transfer to him
the repli thi theori give to histor question ar like the
repli of a man who watch the movement of a herd of cattl and
pai no attent to the vari qualiti of the pasturag in differ
part of the field or to the drive of the herdsman should attribut
the direct the herd take to what anim happen to be at it head
the herd goe in that direct becaus the anim in front lead
it and the collect will of all the other anim is vest in that
leader thi is what historian of the first class saythos who assum
the uncondit transfer of the peopl will
if the anim lead the herd chang thi happen becaus the
collect will of all the anim is transfer from on leader to
anoth accord to whether the anim is or is not lead them in
the direct select by the whole herd such is the repli historian
who assum that the collect will of the peopl is deleg to
ruler under condit which thei regard as known with thi method
of observ it often happen that the observ influenc by the
direct he himself prefer regard those as leader who ow to the
peopl chang of direct ar no longer in front but on on side
or even in the rear
if the anim in front ar continu chang and the direct of
the whole herd is constantli alter thi is becaus in order to follow
a given direct the anim transfer their will to the anim that
have attract our attent and to studi the movement of the herd
we must watch the movement of all the promin anim move on all
side of the herd so sai the third class of historian who regard all
histor person from monarch to journalist as the express of
their ag
the theori of the transfer of the will of the peopl to histor
person is mere a paraphrasea restat of the question in other
word
what caus histor event power what is power power is the
collect will of the peopl transfer to on person under what
condit is the will of the peopl deleg to on person on
condit that that person express the will of the whole peopl that
is power is power in other word power is a word the mean of which
we do not understand
if the realm of human knowledg were confin to abstract reason
then have subject to critic the explan of power that
jurid scienc give us human would conclud that power is mere
a word and ha no real exist but to understand phenomena man
ha besid abstract reason experi by which he verifi hi
reflect and experi tell us that power is not mere a word but
an actual exist phenomenon
not to speak of the fact that no descript of the collect activ
of men can do without the concept of power the exist of power is
prove both by histori and by observ contemporari event
whenev an event occur a man appear or men appear by whose will the
event seem to have taken place napoleon iii issu a decre and the
french go to mexico the king of prussia and bismarck issu decre and
an armi enter bohemia napoleon i issu a decre and an armi enter
russia alexand i give a command and the french submit to the
bourbon experi show us that whatev event occur it is alwai
relat to the will of on or of sever men who have decre it
the historian in accord with the old habit of acknowledg divin
intervent in human affair want to see the caus of event in
the express of the will of someon endow with power but that
supposit is not confirm either by reason or by experi
on the on side reflect show that the express of a man willhi
wordsar onli part of the gener activ express in an event
as for instanc in a war or a revolut and so without assum an
incomprehens supernatur forcea miracleon cannot admit that
word can be the immedi caus of the movement of million of men
on the other hand even if we admit that word could be the caus
of event histori show that the express of the will of histor
personag doe not in most case produc ani effect that is to sai
their command ar often not execut and sometim the veri opposit
of what thei order occur
without admit divin intervent in the affair of human we
cannot regard power as the caus of event
power from the standpoint of experi is mere the relat that
exist between the express of someon will and the execut of
that will by other
to explain the condit of that relationship we must first establish a
concept of the express of will refer it to man and not to the
deiti
if the deiti issu a command express hi will as ancient histori
tell us the express of that will is independ of time and is not
caus by anyth for the divin is not control by an event but
speak of command that ar the express of the will of men act
in time and in relat to on anoth to explain the connect of
command with event we must restor 1 the condit of all that
take place the continu of movement in time both of the event and
of the person who command and 2 the inevit of the connect
between the person command and those who execut hi command
chapter vi
onli the express of the will of the deiti not depend on time can
relat to a whole seri of event occur over a period of year or
centuri and onli the deiti independ of everyth can by hi
sole will determin the direct of human movement but man act
in time and himself take part in what occur
reinstat the first condit omit that of time we see that no
command can be execut without some preced order have been given
render the execut of the last command possibl
no command ever appear spontan or itself cover a whole seri
of occurr but each command follow from anoth and never refer
to a whole seri of event but alwai to on moment onli of an event
when for instanc we sai that napoleon order armi to go to war
we combin in on simultan express a whole seri of consecut
command depend on on anoth napoleon could not have command
an invas of russia and never did so todai he order such and such
paper to be written to vienna to berlin and to petersburg
tomorrow such and such decre and order to the armi the fleet the
commissariat and so on and so onmillion of command which form
a whole seri correspond to a seri of event which brought the
french armi into russia
if throughout hi reign napoleon gave command concern an invas
of england and expend on no other undertak so much time and effort
and yet dure hi whole reign never onc attempt to execut that
design but undertook an expedit into russia with which countri he
consid it desir to be in allianc a convict he repeatedli
expressedthi came about becaus hi command did not correspond to
the cours of event in the first case but did so correspond in the
latter
for an order to be certainli execut it is necessari that a man should
order what can be execut but to know what can and what cannot be
execut is imposs not onli in the case of napoleon invas of
russia in which million particip but even in the simplest event
for in either case million of obstacl mai aris to prevent it
execut everi order execut is alwai on of an immens number
unexecut all the imposs order inconsist with the cours of
event remain unexecut onli the possibl on get link up with a
consecut seri of command correspond to a seri of event and
ar execut
our fals concept that an event is caus by a command which preced
it is due to the fact that when the event ha taken place and out of
thousand of other those few command which were consist with that
event have been execut we forget about the other that were not
execut becaus thei could not be apart from that the chief sourc
of our error in thi matter is due to the fact that in the histor
account a whole seri of innumer divers and petti event such
for instanc as all those which led the french armi to russia is
gener into on event in accord with the result produc by that
seri of event and correspond with thi gener the whole
seri of command is also gener into a singl express of will
we sai that napoleon wish to invad russia and invad it in
realiti in all napoleon activ we never find anyth resembl an
express of that wish but find a seri of order or express of
hi will veri various and indefinit direct amid a long seri
of unexecut order of napoleon on seri for the campaign of 1812
wa carri outnot becaus those order differ in ani wai from the
other unexecut order but becaus thei coincid with the cours of
event that led the french armi into russia just as in stencil work
thi or that figur come out not becaus the color wa laid on from
thi side or in that wai but becaus it wa laid on from all side over
the figur cut in the stencil
so that examin the relat in time of the command to the event
we find that a command can never be the caus of the event but that a
certain definit depend exist between the two
to understand in what thi depend consist it is necessari to
reinstat anoth omit condit of everi command proceed not from
the deiti but from a man which is that the man who give the command
himself take part in the event
thi relat of the command to those he command is just what is
call power thi relat consist in the follow
for common action peopl alwai unit in certain combin in which
regardless of the differ of the aim set for the common action the
relat between those take part in it is alwai the same
men unit in these combin alwai assum such relat toward
on anoth that the larger number take a more direct share and the
smaller number a less direct share in the collect action for which
thei have combin
of all the combin in which men unit for collect action on of
the most strike and definit exampl is an armi
everi armi is compos of lower grade of the serviceth rank and
fileof whom there ar alwai the greatest number of the next higher
militari rankcorpor and noncommiss offic of whom there ar
fewer and of stillhigh offic of whom there ar still fewer
and so on to the highest militari command which is concentr in on
person
a militari organ mai be quit correctli compar to a cone of
which the base with the largest diamet consist of the rank and file
the next higher and smaller section of the cone consist of the next
higher grade of the armi and so on to the apex the point of which
will repres the command in chief
the soldier of whom there ar the most form the lower section of
the cone and it base the soldier himself doe the stab hack
burn and pillag and alwai receiv order for these action
from men abov him he himself never give an order the noncommiss
offic of whom there ar fewer perform the action itself less
frequent than the soldier but thei alreadi give command an
offic still less often act directli himself but command still more
frequent a gener doe noth but command the troop indic the
object and hardli ever us a weapon himself the command in chief
never take direct part in the action itself but onli give gener
order concern the movement of the mass of the troop a similar
relat of peopl to on anoth is seen in everi combin of men
for common activityin agricultur trade and everi administr
and so without particularli analyz all the contigu section of
a cone and of the rank of an armi or the rank and posit in
ani administr or public busi whatev from the lowest to the
highest we see a law by which men to take associ action combin
in such relat that the more directli thei particip in perform
the action the less thei can command and the more numer thei ar
while the less their direct particip in the action itself the more
thei command and the fewer of them there ar rise in thi wai from
the lowest rank to the man at the top who take the least direct share
in the action and direct hi activ chiefli to command
thi relat of the men who command to those thei command is what
constitut the essenc of the concept call power
have restor the condit of time under which all event occur
we find that a command is execut onli when it is relat to a
correspond seri of event restor the essenti condit of
relat between those who command and those who execut we find that
by the veri natur of the case those who command take the smallest part
in the action itself and that their activ is exclus direct to
command
chapter vii
when an event is take place peopl express their opinion and wish
about it and as the event result from the collect activ of
mani peopl some on of the opinion or wish express is sure to be
fulfil if but approxim when on of the opinion express
is fulfil that opinion get connect with the event as a command
preced it
men ar haul a log each of them express hi opinion as to how and
where to haul it thei haul the log awai and it happen that thi is
done as on of them said he order it there we have command and power
in their primari form the man who work most with hi hand could not
think so much about what he wa do or reflect on or command what
would result from the common activ while the man who command
more would evid work less with hi hand on account of hi greater
verbal activ
when some larger concours of men direct their activ to a common aim
there is a yet sharper divis of those who becaus their activ is
given to direct and command take less part in the direct work
when a man work alon he alwai ha a certain set of reflect which
as it seem to him direct hi past activ justifi hi present
activ and guid him in plan hi futur action just the same is
done by a concours of peopl allow those who do not take a direct
part in the activ to devis consider justif and
surmis concern their collect activ
for reason known or unknown to us the french began to drown and kill
on anoth and correspond to the event it justif appear in
peopl belief that thi wa necessari for the welfar of franc for
liberti and for equal peopl ceas to kill on anoth and
thi event wa accompani by it justif in the necess for a
central of power resist to europ and so on men went
from the west to the east kill their fellow men and the event
wa accompani by phrase about the glori of franc the base of
england and so on histori show us that these justif of the
event have no common sens and ar all contradictori as in the case of
kill a man as the result of recogn hi right and the kill
of million in russia for the humili of england but these
justif have a veri necessari signific in their own dai
these justif releas those who produc the event from moral
respons these temporari aim ar like the broom fix in front
of a locomot to clear the snow from the rail in front thei clear
men moral respons from their path
without such justif there would be no repli to the simplest
question that present itself when examin each histor event how
is it that million of men commit collect crimesmak war commit
murder and so on
with the present complex form of polit and social life in europ
can ani event that is not prescrib decre or order by monarch
minist parliament or newspap be imagin is there ani
collect action which cannot find it justif in polit
uniti in patriot in the balanc of power or in civil so
that everi event that occur inevit coincid with some express
wish and receiv a justif present itself as the result of
the will of on man or of sever men
in whatev direct a ship move the flow of the wave it cut
will alwai be notic ahead of it to those on board the ship the
movement of those wave will be the onli percept motion
onli by watch close moment by moment the movement of that flow and
compar it with the movement of the ship do we convinc ourselv that
everi bit of it is occas by the forward movement of the ship
and that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselv were
impercept move
we see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of histor
charact that is reestablish the inevit condit of all that
occursth continu of movement in time and do not lose sight of the
essenti connect of histor person with the mass
when the ship move in on direct there is on and the same wave
ahead of it when it turn frequent the wave ahead of it also turn
frequent but wherev it mai turn there alwai will be the wave
anticip it movement
whatev happen it alwai appear that just that event wa foreseen
and decre wherev the ship mai go the rush of water which neither
direct nor increas it movement foam ahead of it and at a distanc
seem to us not mere to move of itself but to govern the ship
movement also
examin onli those express of the will of histor person
which as command were relat to event historian have assum
that the event depend on those command but examin the event
themselv and the connect in which the histor person stood to
the peopl we have found that thei and their order were depend on
event the incontest proof of thi deduct is that howev mani
command were issu the event doe not take place unless there ar
other caus for it but as soon as an event occursb it what it
maythen out of all the continu express wish of differ peopl
some will alwai be found which by their mean and their time of
utter ar relat as command to the event
arriv at thi conclus we can repli directli and posit to
these two essenti question of histori
1 what is power
2 what forc produc the movement of the nation
1 power is the relat of a given person to other individu
in which the more thi person express opinion predict and
justif of the collect action that is perform the less is
hi particip in that action
2 the movement of nation is caus not by power nor by intellectu
activ nor even by a combin of the two as historian have
suppos but by the activ of all the peopl who particip in
the event and who alwai combin in such a wai that those take
the largest direct share in the event take on themselv the least
respons and vice versa
moral the wielder of power appear to caus the event physic
it is those who submit to the power but as the moral activ is
inconceiv without the physic the caus of the event is neither in
the on nor in the other but in the union of the two
or in other word the concept of a caus is inapplic to the
phenomena we ar examin
in the last analysi we reach the circl of infinitythat final limit
to which in everi domain of thought man reason arriv if it is not
plai with the subject electr produc heat heat produc
electr atom attract each other and atom repel on anoth
speak of the interact of heat and electr and of atom we
cannot sai why thi occur and we sai that it is so becaus it is
inconceiv otherwis becaus it must be so and that it is a law the
same appli to histor event why war and revolut occur we do
not know we onli know that to produc the on or the other action
peopl combin in a certain format in which thei all take part and
we sai that thi is so becaus it is unthink otherwis or in other
word that it is a law
chapter viii
if histori dealt onli with extern phenomena the establish of thi
simpl and obviou law would suffic and we should have finish our
argument but the law of histori relat to man a particl of matter
cannot tell us that it doe not feel the law of attract or repuls
and that that law is untru but man who is the subject of histori
sai plainli i am free and am therefor not subject to the law
the presenc of the problem of man free will though unexpress is
felt at everi step of histori
all serious think historian have involuntarili encount thi
question all the contradict and obscur of histori and the
fals path histor scienc ha follow ar due sole to the lack of
a solut of that question
if the will of everi man were free that is if each man could act as he
pleas all histori would be a seri of disconnect incid
if in a thousand year even on man in a million could act freeli that
is as he chose it is evid that on singl free act of that man
in violat of the law govern human action would destroi the
possibl of the exist of ani law for the whole of human
if there be a singl law govern the action of men free will cannot
exist for then man will is subject to that law
in thi contradict li the problem of free will which from most
ancient time ha occupi the best human mind and from most ancient
time ha been present in it whole tremend signific
the problem is that regard man as a subject of observ
from whatev point of viewtheolog histor ethic or
philosophicw find a gener law of necess to which he like all
that exist is subject but regard him from within ourselv as what
we ar consciou of we feel ourselv to be free
thi conscious is a sourc of selfcognit quit apart from and
independ of reason through hi reason man observ himself but onli
through conscious doe he know himself
apart from conscious of self no observ or applic of reason
is conceiv
to understand observ and draw conclus man must first of all be
consciou of himself as live a man is onli consciou of himself as
a live be by the fact that he will that is is consciou of
hi volit but hi willwhich form the essenc of hi lifeman
recogn and can but recogn as free
if observ himself man see that hi will is alwai direct by
on and the same law whether he observ the necess of take
food us hi brain or anyth els he cannot recogn thi
nevervari direct of hi will otherwis than as a limit of
it were it not free it could not be limit a man will seem to him
to be limit just becaus he is not consciou of it except as free
you sai i am not free but i have lift my hand and let it fall
everyon understand that thi illog repli is an irrefut
demonstr of freedom
that repli is the express of a conscious that is not subject to
reason
if the conscious of freedom were not a separ and independ
sourc of selfconsci it would be subject to reason and
to experi but in fact such subject doe not exist and is
inconceiv
a seri of experi and argument prove to everi man that he as
an object of observ is subject to certain law and man submit to
them and never resist the law of graviti or imperm onc he
ha becom acquaint with them but the same seri of experi
and argument prove to him that the complet freedom of which he is
consciou in himself is imposs and that hi everi action depend
on hi organ hi charact and the motiv act upon him yet
man never submit to the deduct of these experi and argument
have learn from experi and argument that a stone fall
downward a man indubit believ thi and alwai expect the law
that he ha learn to be fulfil
but learn just as certainli that hi will is subject to law he doe
not and cannot believ thi
howev often experi and reason mai show a man that under the
same condit and with the same charact he will do the same thing as
befor yet when under the same condit and with the same charact
he approach for the thousandth time the action that alwai end in the
same wai he feel as certainli convinc as befor the experi
that he can act as he pleas everi man savag or sage howev
incontest reason and experi mai prove to him that it is
imposs to imagin two differ cours of action in precis the
same condit feel that without thi irrat concept which
constitut the essenc of freedom he cannot imagin life he feel
that howev imposs it mai be it is so for without thi concept
of freedom not onli would he be unabl to understand life but he would
be unabl to live for a singl moment
he could not live becaus all man effort all hi impuls to life
ar onli effort to increas freedom wealth and poverti fame and
obscur power and subordin strength and weak health and
diseas cultur and ignor work and leisur replet and hunger
virtu and vice ar onli greater or lesser degre of freedom
a man have no freedom cannot be conceiv of except as depriv of
life
if the concept of freedom appear to reason to be a senseless
contradict like the possibl of perform two action at on and
the same instant of time or of an effect without a caus that onli
prove that conscious is not subject to reason
thi unshak irrefut conscious of freedom uncontrol by
experi or argument recogn by all thinker and felt by everyon
without except thi conscious without which no concept of man
is possibl constitut the other side of the question
man is the creation of an allpow allgood and allse god
what is sin the concept of which aris from the conscious of
man freedom that is a question for theologi
the action of men ar subject to gener immut law express in
statist what is man respons to societi the concept of
which result from the concept of freedom that is a question for
jurisprud
man action proce from hi innat charact and the motiv act
upon him what is conscienc and the percept of right and wrong
in action that follow from the conscious of freedom that is a
question for ethic
man in connect with the gener life of human appear subject
to law which determin that life but the same man apart from that
connect appear to be free how should the past life of nation and
of human be regardeda the result of the free or as the result of
the constrain activ of man that is a question for histori
onli in our selfconfid dai of the popular of knowledgethank
to that most power engin of ignor the diffus of print
matterha the question of the freedom of will been put on a level on
which the question itself cannot exist in our time the major of
socal advanc peoplethat is the crowd of ignoramuseshav taken
the work of the naturalist who deal with on side of the question for a
solut of the whole problem
thei sai and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist
for the life of man is express by muscular movement and muscular
movement ar condit by the activ of the nerv the soul and
free will do not exist becaus at an unknown period of time we sprang
from the ap thei sai thi not at all suspect that thousand of
year ago that same law of necess which with such ardor thei ar now
try to prove by physiolog and compar zoologi wa not mere
acknowledg by all the religion and all the thinker but ha never
been deni thei do not see that the role of the natur scienc in
thi matter is mere to serv as an instrument for the illumin
of on side of it for the fact that from the point of view of
observ reason and the will ar mere secret of the brain and
that man follow the gener law mai have develop from lower anim
at some unknown period of time onli explain from a fresh side
the truth admit thousand of year ago by all the religi and
philosoph theoriesthat from the point of view of reason man is
subject to the law of necess but it doe not advanc by a hair
breadth the solut of the question which ha anoth opposit side
base on the conscious of freedom
if men descend from the ap at an unknown period of time that is
as comprehens as that thei were made from a hand of earth at a
certain period of time in the first case the unknown quantiti is the
time in the second case it is the origin and the question of how
man conscious of freedom is to be reconcil with the law of
necess to which he is subject cannot be solv by compar
physiolog and zoologi for in a frog a rabbit or an ap we can
observ onli the muscular nervou activ but in man we observ
conscious as well as the muscular and nervou activ
the naturalist and their follow think thei can solv thi
question ar like plaster set to plaster on side of the wall of
a church who avail themselv of the absenc of the chief
superintend of the work should in an access of zeal plaster over the
window icon woodwork and still unbuttress wall and should be
delight that from their point of view as plaster everyth is now
so smooth and regular
chapter ix
for the solut of the question of free will or inevit histori
ha thi advantag over other branch of knowledg in which the
question is dealt with that for histori thi question doe not refer
to the essenc of man free will but it manifest in the past and
under certain condit
in regard to thi question histori stand to the other scienc as
experiment scienc stand to abstract scienc
the subject for histori is not man will itself but our present of
it
and so for histori the insolubl mysteri present by the
incompat of free will and inevit doe not exist as it doe
for theologi ethic and philosophi histori survei a present of
man life in which the union of these two contradict ha alreadi
taken place
in actual life each histor event each human action is veri clearli
and definit understood without ani sens of contradict although
each event present itself as partli free and partli compulsori
to solv the question of how freedom and necess ar combin and
what constitut the essenc of these two concept the philosophi
of histori can and should follow a path contrari to that taken by other
scienc instead of first defin the concept of freedom and
inevit in themselv and then rang the phenomena of life
under those definit histori should deduc a definit of the
concept of freedom and inevit themselv from the immens
quantiti of phenomena of which it is cogniz and that alwai appear
depend on these two element
whatev present of the activ of mani men or of an individu
we mai consid we alwai regard it as the result partli of man free
will and partli of the law of inevit
whether we speak of the migrat of the peopl and the incurs
of the barbarian or of the decre of napoleon iii or of someon
action an hour ago in choos on direct out of sever for hi
walk we ar unconsci of ani contradict the degre of freedom and
inevit govern the action of these peopl is clearli defin
for us
our concept of the degre of freedom often vari accord to
differ in the point of view from which we regard the event but
everi human action appear to us as a certain combin of freedom and
inevit in everi action we examin we see a certain measur of
freedom and a certain measur of inevit and alwai the more
freedom we see in ani action the less inevit do we perceiv and
the more inevit the less freedom
the proport of freedom to inevit decreas and increas
accord to the point of view from which the action is regard but
their relat is alwai on of invers proport
a sink man who clutch at anoth and drown him or a hungri mother
exhaust by feed her babi who steal some food or a man train
to disciplin who on duti at the word of command kill a defenseless
manseem less guilti that is less free and more subject to the law of
necess to on who know the circumst in which these peopl were
place and more free to on who doe not know that the man wa himself
drown that the mother wa hungri that the soldier wa in the rank
and so on similarli a man who commit a murder twenti year ago and
ha sinc live peaceabl and harmlessli in societi seem less guilti
and hi action more due to the law of inevit to someon who
consid hi action after twenti year have elaps than to on who
examin it the dai after it wa commit and in the same wai everi
action of an insan intox or highli excit man appear less
free and more inevit to on who know the mental condit of him
who commit the action and seem more free and less inevit to on
who doe not know it in all these case the concept of freedom
is increas or diminish and the concept of compuls is
correspondingli decreas or increas accord to the point of view
from which the action is regard so that the greater the concept of
necess the smaller the concept of freedom and vice versa
religion the common sens of mankind the scienc of jurisprud
and histori itself understand alik thi relat between necess and
freedom
all case without except in which our concept of freedom and
necess is increas and diminish depend on three consider
1 the relat to the extern world of the man who commit the deed
2 hi relat to time
3 hi relat to the caus lead to the action
the first consider is the clear of our percept of the man
relat to the extern world and the greater or lesser clear
of our understand of the definit posit occupi by the man
in relat to everyth coexist with him thi is what make it
evid that a drown man is less free and more subject to necess
than on stand on dry ground and that make the action of a man
close connect with other in a thickli popul district or of on
bound by famili offici or busi duti seem certainli less free
and more subject to necess than those of a man live in solitud and
seclus
if we consid a man alon apart from hi relat to everyth around
him each action of hi seem to us free but if we see hi relat
to anyth around him if we see hi connect with anyth
whateverwith a man who speak to him a book he read the work on
which he is engag even with the air he breath or the light that
fall on the thing about himw see that each of these circumst
ha an influenc on him and control at least some side of hi activ
and the more we perceiv of these influenc the more our concept of
hi freedom diminish and the more our concept of the necess that
weigh on him increas
the second consider is the more or less evid time relat of
the man to the world and the clear of our percept of the place
the man action occupi in time that is the ground which make the
fall of the first man result in the product of the human race
appear evid less free than a man entri into marriag todai it is
the reason why the life and activ of peopl who live centuri ago
and ar connect with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the life
of a contemporari the consequ of which ar still unknown to me
the degre of our concept of freedom or inevit depend in thi
respect on the greater or lesser laps of time between the perform
of the action and our judgment of it
if i examin an act i perform a moment ago in approxim the same
circumst as those i am in now my action appear to me undoubtedli
free but if i examin an act perform a month ago then be in
differ circumst i cannot help recogn that if that act had
not been commit much that result from itgood agreeabl and even
essentialwould not have taken place if i reflect on an action still
more remot ten year ago or more then the consequ of my action
ar still plainer to me and i find it hard to imagin what would have
happen had that action not been perform the farther i go back
in memori or what is the same thing the farther i go forward in my
judgment the more doubt becom my belief in the freedom of my
action
in histori we find a veri similar progress of convict concern
the part plai by free will in the gener affair of human a
contemporari event seem to us to be indubit the do of all the
known particip but with a more remot event we alreadi see it
inevit result which prevent our consid anyth els possibl
and the farther we go back in examin event the less arbitrari do
thei appear
the austroprussian war appear to us undoubtedli the result of the
crafti conduct of bismarck and so on the napoleon war still seem
to us though alreadi question to be the outcom of their hero
will but in the crusad we alreadi see an event occupi it definit
place in histori and without which we cannot imagin the modern histori
of europ though to the chronicl of the crusad that event appear
as mere due to the will of certain peopl in regard to the migrat
of the peopl it doe not enter anyon head todai to suppos that
the renov of the european world depend on attila capric the
farther back in histori the object of our observ li the more
doubt doe the free will of those concern in the event becom and
the more manifest the law of inevit
the third consider is the degre to which we apprehend that
endless chain of causat inevit demand by reason in which each
phenomenon comprehend and therefor man everi action must have
it definit place as a result of what ha gone befor and as a caus of
what will follow
the better we ar acquaint with the physiolog psycholog and
histor law deduc by observ and by which man is control
and the more correctli we perceiv the physiolog psycholog
and histor caus of the action and the simpler the action we ar
observ and the less complex the charact and mind of the man in
question the more subject to inevit and the less free do our
action and those of other appear
when we do not at all understand the caus of an action whether a
crime a good action or even on that is simpli nonmor we ascrib a
greater amount of freedom to it in the case of a crime we most urgent
demand the punish for such an act in the case of a virtuou act we
rate it merit most highli in an indiffer case we recogn in it
more individu origin and independ but if even on of
the innumer caus of the act is known to us we recogn a certain
element of necess and ar less insist on punish for the crime
or the acknowledg of the merit of the virtuou act or the freedom
of the appar origin action that a crimin wa rear among
malefactor mitig hi fault in our ey the selfsacrific of a father
or mother or selfsacrific with the possibl of a reward is more
comprehens than gratuit selfsacrific and therefor seem less
deserv of sympathi and less the result of free will the founder of a
sect or parti or an inventor impress us less when we know how or by
what the wai wa prepar for hi activ if we have a larg rang
of exampl if our observ is constantli direct to seek the
correl of caus and effect in peopl action their action
appear to us more under compuls and less free the more correctli we
connect the effect with the caus if we examin simpl action and
had a vast number of such action under observ our concept of
their inevit would be still greater the dishonest conduct of the
son of a dishonest father the misconduct of a woman who had fallen
into bad compani a drunkard relaps into drunken and so on ar
action that seem to us less free the better we understand their caus
if the man whose action we ar consid is on a veri low stage of
mental develop like a child a madman or a simpletonthen
know the caus of the act and the simplic of the charact and
intellig in question we see so larg an element of necess and so
littl free will that as soon as we know the caus prompt the action
we can foretel the result
on these three consider alon is base the concept of
irrespons for crime and the extenu circumst admit
by all legisl code the respons appear greater or less
accord to our greater or lesser knowledg of the circumst in
which the man wa place whose action is be judg and accord
to the greater or lesser interv of time between the commiss of the
action and it investig and accord to the greater or lesser
understand of the caus that led to the action
chapter x
thu our concept of free will and inevit gradual diminish
or increas accord to the greater or lesser connect with the
extern world the greater or lesser remot of time and the
greater or lesser depend on the caus in relat to which we
contempl a man life
so that if we examin the case of a man whose connect with the
extern world is well known where the time between the action and
it examin is great and where the caus of the action ar most
access we get the concept of a maximum of inevit and a
minimum of free will if we examin a man littl depend on extern
condit whose action wa perform veri recent and the caus of
whose action ar beyond our ken we get the concept of a minimum of
inevit and a maximum of freedom
in neither casehowev we mai chang our point of view howev plain
we mai make to ourselv the connect between the man and the extern
world howev inaccess it mai be to us howev long or short the
period of time howev intellig or incomprehens the caus
of the action mai becan we ever conceiv either complet freedom or
complet necess
1 to whatev degre we mai imagin a man to be exempt from the
influenc of the extern world we never get a concept of freedom
in space everi human action is inevit condit by what surround
him and by hi own bodi i lift my arm and let it fall my action seem
to me free but ask myself whether i could rais my arm in everi
direct i see that i rais it in the direct in which there wa
least obstruct to that action either from thing around me or from
the construct of my own bodi i chose on out of all the possibl
direct becaus in it there were fewest obstacl for my action
to be free it wa necessari that it should encount no obstacl to
conceiv of a man be free we must imagin him outsid space which is
evid imposs
2 howev much we approxim the time of judgment to the time of the
deed we never get a concept of freedom in time for if i examin
an action commit a second ago i must still recogn it as not
be free for it is irrevoc link to the moment at which it wa
commit can i lift my arm i lift it but ask myself could i have
abstain from lift my arm at the moment that ha alreadi pass to
convinc myself of thi i do not lift it the next moment but i am
not now abstain from do so at the first moment when i ask the
question time ha gone by which i could not detain the arm i then
lift is no longer the same as the arm i now refrain from lift
nor is the air in which i lift it the same that now surround me the
moment in which the first movement wa made is irrevoc and at that
moment i could make onli on movement and whatev movement i made
would be the onli on that i did not lift my arm a moment later doe
not prove that i could have abstain from lift it then and sinc i
could make onli on movement at that singl moment of time it could not
have been ani other to imagin it as free it is necessari to imagin
it in the present on the boundari between the past and the futurethat
is outsid time which is imposs
3 howev much the difficulti of understand the caus mai be
increas we never reach a concept of complet freedom that is
an absenc of caus howev inaccess to us mai be the caus of the
express of will in ani action our own or anoth the first demand
of reason is the assumpt of and search for a caus for without a
caus no phenomenon is conceiv i rais my arm to perform an action
independ of ani caus but my wish to perform an action without a
caus is the caus of my action
but even ifimagin a man quit exempt from all influenc examin
onli hi momentari action in the present unevok by ani causew were
to admit so infinit small a remaind of inevit as equal
zero we should even then not have arriv at the concept of complet
freedom in man for a be uninfluenc by the extern world stand
outsid of time and independ of caus is no longer a man
in the same wai we can never imagin the action of a man quit devoid of
freedom and entir subject to the law of inevit
1 howev we mai increas our knowledg of the condit of space
in which man is situat that knowledg can never be complet for the
number of those condit is as infinit as the infin of space and
therefor so long as not all the condit influenc men ar defin
there is no complet inevit but a certain measur of freedom
remain
2 howev we mai prolong the period of time between the action we ar
examin and the judgment upon it that period will be finit while
time is infinit and so in thi respect too there can never be absolut
inevit
3 howev access mai be the chain of causat of ani action we
shall never know the whole chain sinc it is endless and so again we
never reach absolut inevit
but besid thi even if admit the remain minimum of freedom to
equal zero we assum in some given casea for instanc in that of a
dy man an unborn babe or an idiotcomplet absenc of freedom by
so do we should destroi the veri concept of man in the case we ar
examin for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man and
so the concept of the action of a man subject sole to the law of
inevit without ani element of freedom is just as imposs as
the concept of a man complet free action
and so to imagin the action of a man entir subject to the law of
inevit without ani freedom we must assum the knowledg of an
infinit number of space relat an infinit long period of time
and an infinit seri of caus
to imagin a man perfectli free and not subject to the law of
inevit we must imagin him all alon beyond space beyond time
and free from depend on caus
in the first case if inevit were possibl without freedom
we should have reach a definit of inevit by the law of
inevit itself that is a mere form without content
in the second case if freedom were possibl without inevit we
should have arriv at uncondit freedom beyond space time and
caus which by the fact of it be uncondit and unlimit would
be noth or mere content without form
we should in fact have reach those two fundament of which man
whole outlook on the univers is constructedth incomprehens
essenc of life and the law defin that essenc
reason sai 1 space with all the form of matter that give it
visibl is infinit and cannot be imagin otherwis 2 time is
infinit motion without a moment of rest and is unthink otherwis
3 the connect between caus and effect ha no begin and can
have no end
conscious sai 1 i alon am and all that exist is but me
consequ i includ space 2 i measur flow time by the fix
moment of the present in which alon i am consciou of myself as live
consequ i am outsid time 3 i am beyond caus for i feel myself
to be the caus of everi manifest of my life
reason give express to the law of inevit conscious
give express to the essenc of freedom
freedom not limit by anyth is the essenc of life in man
conscious inevit without content is man reason in it
three form
freedom is the thing examin inevit is what examin freedom
is the content inevit is the form
onli by separ the two sourc of cognit relat to on anoth
as form to content do we get the mutual exclus and separ
incomprehens concept of freedom and inevit
onli by unit them do we get a clear concept of man life
apart from these two concept which in their union mutual defin on
anoth as form and content no concept of life is possibl
all that we know of the life of man is mere a certain relat of free
will to inevit that is of conscious to the law of reason
all that we know of the extern world of natur is onli a certain
relat of the forc of natur to inevit or of the essenc of
life to the law of reason
the great natur forc lie outsid us and we ar not consciou of
them we call those forc gravit inertia electr anim
forc and so on but we ar consciou of the forc of life in man and
we call that freedom
but just as the forc of gravit incomprehens in itself but
felt by everi man is understood by us onli to the extent to which we
know the law of inevit to which it is subject from the first
knowledg that all bodi have weight up to newton law so too the
forc of free will incomprehens in itself but of which everyon is
consciou is intellig to us onli in as far as we know the law of
inevit to which it is subject from the fact that everi man di
up to the knowledg of the most complex econom and histor law
all knowledg is mere a bring of thi essenc of life under the
law of reason
man free will differ from everi other forc in that man is directli
consciou of it but in the ey of reason it in no wai differ from
ani other forc the forc of gravit electr or chemic
affin ar onli distinguish from on anoth in that thei ar
differ defin by reason just so the forc of man free will
is distinguish by reason from the other forc of natur onli by the
definit reason give it freedom apart from necess that is
apart from the law of reason that defin it differ in no wai from
gravit or heat or the forc that make thing grow for reason
it is onli a momentari undefin sensat of life
and as the undefin essenc of the forc move the heavenli bodi
the undefin essenc of the forc of heat and electr or
of chemic affin or of the vital forc form the content of
astronomi physic chemistri botani zoologi and so on just in the
same wai doe the forc of free will form the content of histori
but just as the subject of everi scienc is the manifest of thi
unknown essenc of life while that essenc itself can onli be the
subject of metaphys even the manifest of the forc of free will
in human be in space in time and in depend on caus form
the subject of histori while free will itself is the subject of
metaphys
in the experiment scienc what we know we call the law of
inevit what is unknown to us we call vital forc vital forc is
onli an express for the unknown remaind over and abov what we know
of the essenc of life
so also in histori what is known to us we call law of inevit
what is unknown we call free will free will is for histori onli an
express for the unknown remaind of what we know about the law of
human life
chapter xi
histori examin the manifest of man free will in connect
with the extern world in time and in depend on caus that is it
defin thi freedom by the law of reason and so histori is a scienc
onli in so far as thi free will is defin by those law
the recognit of man free will as someth capabl of influenc
histor event that is as not subject to law is the same for
histori as the recognit of a free forc move the heavenli bodi
would be for astronomi
that assumpt would destroi the possibl of the exist of law
that is of ani scienc whatev if there is even a singl bodi
move freeli then the law of kepler and newton ar negativ and no
concept of the movement of the heavenli bodi ani longer exist if
ani singl action is due to free will then not a singl histor law
can exist nor ani concept of histor event
for histori line exist of the movement of human will on end
of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a
conscious of man will in the present move in space time and
depend on caus
the more thi field of motion spread out befor our ey the more
evid ar the law of that movement to discov and defin those law
is the problem of histori
from the standpoint from which the scienc of histori now regard it
subject on the path it now follow seek the caus of event in
man free will a scientif enunci of those law is imposs
for howev man free will mai be restrict as soon as we recogn
it as a forc not subject to law the exist of law becom
imposs
onli by reduc thi element of free will to the infinitesim that
is by regard it as an infinit small quantiti can we convinc
ourselv of the absolut inaccess of the caus and then
instead of seek caus histori will take the discoveri of law as
it problem
the search for these law ha long been begun and the new method of
thought which histori must adopt ar be work out simultan
with the selfdestruct toward whichev dissect and dissect
the caus of phenomenath old method of histori is move
all human scienc have travel along that path arriv at
infinitesim mathemat the most exact of scienc abandon the
process of analysi and enter on the new process of the integr
of unknown infinit small quantiti abandon the concept
of caus mathemat seek law that is the properti common to all
unknown infinit small element
in anoth form but along the same path of reflect the other scienc
have proceed when newton enunci the law of graviti he did not sai
that the sun or the earth had a properti of attract he said that all
bodi from the largest to the smallest have the properti of attract
on anoth that is leav asid the question of the caus of the
movement of the bodi he express the properti common to all bodi
from the infinit larg to the infinit small the same is done by
the natur scienc leav asid the question of caus thei seek for
law histori stand on the same path and if histori ha for it object
the studi of the movement of the nation and of human and not the
narrat of episod in the live of individu it too set
asid the concept of caus should seek the law common to all the
insepar interconnect infinitesim element of free will
chapter xii
from the time the law of copernicu wa discov and prove the mere
recognit of the fact that it wa not the sun but the earth that move
suffic to destroi the whole cosmographi of the ancient by disprov
that law it might have been possibl to retain the old concept of
the movement of the bodi but without disprov it it would seem
imposs to continu studi the ptolema world but even after
the discoveri of the law of copernicu the ptolema world were still
studi for a long time
from the time the first person said and prove that the number of birth
or of crime is subject to mathemat law and that thi or that
mode of govern is determin by certain geograph and econom
condit and that certain relat of popul to soil produc
migrat of peopl the foundat on which histori had been built
were destroi in their essenc
by refut these new law the former view of histori might have been
retain but without refut them it would seem imposs to continu
studi histor event as the result of man free will for if a
certain mode of govern wa establish or certain migrat
of peopl took place in consequ of such and such geograph
ethnograph or econom condit then the free will of those
individu who appear to us to have establish that mode of govern
or occas the migrat can no longer be regard as the caus
and yet the former histori continu to be studi side by side with the
law of statist geographi polit economi compar philolog
and geologi which directli contradict it assumpt
the struggl between the old view and the new wa long and stubbornli
fought out in physic philosophi theologi stood on guard for the
old view and accus the new of violat revel but when truth
conquer theologi establish itself just as firmli on the new
foundat
just as prolong and stubborn is the struggl now proceed between
the old and the new concept of histori and theologi in the same wai
stand on guard for the old view and accus the new view of subvert
revel
in the on case as in the other on both side the struggl provok
passion and stifl truth on the on hand there is fear and regret for
the loss of the whole edific construct through the ag on the other
is the passion for destruct
to the men who fought against the rise truth of physic philosophi
it seem that if thei admit that truth it would destroi faith in
god in the creation of the firmament and in the miracl of joshua the
son of nun to the defend of the law of copernicu and newton to
voltair for exampl it seem that the law of astronomi destroi
religion and he util the law of gravit as a weapon against
religion
just so it now seem as if we have onli to admit the law of
inevit to destroi the concept of the soul of good and evil
and all the institut of state and church that have been built up on
those concept
so too like voltair in hi time uninvit defend of the law of
inevit todai us that law as a weapon against religion though
the law of inevit in histori like the law of copernicu in
astronomi far from destroi even strengthen the foundat on which
the institut of state and church ar erect
as in the question of astronomi then so in the question of histori
now the whole differ of opinion is base on the recognit or
nonrecognit of someth absolut serv as the measur of visibl
phenomena in astronomi it wa the immov of the earth in histori
it is the independ of personalityfre will
as with astronomi the difficulti of recogn the motion of the earth
lai in abandon the immedi sensat of the earth fixiti and of
the motion of the planet so in histori the difficulti of recogn
the subject of person to the law of space time and caus
li in renounc the direct feel of the independ of on own
person but as in astronomi the new view said it is true that we
do not feel the movement of the earth but by admit it immobl
we arriv at absurd while by admit it motion which we do not
feel we arriv at law so also in histori the new view sai it is
true that we ar not consciou of our depend but by admit our
free will we arriv at absurd while by admit our depend on
the extern world on time and on caus we arriv at law
in the first case it wa necessari to renounc the conscious of an
unreal immobl in space and to recogn a motion we did not feel
in the present case it is similarli necessari to renounc a freedom
that doe not exist and to recogn a depend of which we ar not
consciou
