it is difficult to sai what ar and what ar not the fabl of sop
almost all the fabl that have appear in the western world have been
shelter at on time or anoth under the shadow of that name i could
at ani rate enumer at least seven hundr which have appear in
english in variou book entitl sop fabl lestrang
collect alon contain over five hundr in the struggl for
exist among all these a certain number stand out as be the most
effect and the most familiar i have attempt to bring most of
these into the follow page
there is no fix text even for the nucleu collect contain in
thi book sop himself is so shadowi a figur that we might almost be
forgiven if we held with regard to him the heresi of mistress
elizabeth prig what we call hi fabl can in most case be trace
back to the fabl of other peopl notabl of phdru and babriu it
is usual to regard the greek prose collect pass under the name
of sop as have greater claim to the eponym titl but modern
research ha shown that these ar but mediev prose of babriuss
vers i have therefor felt at liberti to retel the fabl in such a
wai as would interest children and have adopt from the variou
version that which seem most suitabl in each case tell the
fabl anew in my own wai
much ha been learnt dure the present centuri about the histori of
the variou apologu that walk abroad under the name of sop i have
attempt to bring these variou line of research togeth in the
somewhat elabor introductori volum which i wrote to accompani my
edit of caxton sop publish by mr nutt in hi bibliothqu
de caraba i have place in front of the present version of the
fabl by kind permiss of mr nutt the short abstract of my
research in which i there sum up the result of that volum i
must accompani it here as there by a warn to the reader that for
a larg proport of the result thu reach i am myself respons
but i am happi to sai that mani of them have been accept by the
expert in america franc and germani who have done me the honour to
consid my research here in england there doe not seem to be
much interest in thi class of work and english scholar for the most
part ar content to remain in ignor of the method and result of
literari histori
i have attach to the fabl in the obscur of small print at the
end a seri of note sum up what is known as to the proven
of each fabl here again i have tri to put in shorter and more
readabl form the result of my research in the volum to which i
have alreadi refer for more detail inform i must refer to
the forti closelyprint page vol i pp 225268 which contain the
bibliographi of the fabl

a short histori of the sopic fabl
most nation develop the beasttal as part of their folklor some go
further and appli it to satir purpos and a few nation afford
isol exampl of the shape of the beasttal to teach some moral
truth by mean of the fabl properli so called1 but onli two peopl
independ made thi a gener practic both in greece2 and in
india we find in the earliest literatur such casual and frequent
mention of fabl as seem to impli a bodi of folkfabl current among
the peopl and in both countri special circumst rais the
fabl from folklor into literatur in greec dure the epoch of the
tyrant when free speech wa danger the fabl wa larg us for
polit purpos the inventor of thi applic or the most
promin user of it wa on sop a slave at samo whose name ha ever
sinc been connect with the fabl all that we know about him is
contain in a few line of herodotu that he flourish 550 bc wa
kill in accord with a delphian oracl and that wergild wa
claim for him by the grandson of hi master iadmon when free speech
wa establish in the greek democraci the custom of us fabl in
harangu wa continu and encourag by the rhetorician while the
mirthproduc qualiti of the fabl caus it to be regard as fit
subject of afterdinn convers along with other jest of a
broader kind milesian sybarit thi habit of regard the
fabl as a form of the jest intensifi the tendenc to connect it with
a wellknown name as in the case of our joe miller about 300 bc
demetriu phalereu whilom tyrant of athen and founder of the
alexandria librari collect togeth all the fabl he could find
under the titl of assembl of sopic tale
thi collect run probabl to some 200 fabl after
be interpol and edit by the alexandrin grammarian wa
turn into neat latin iambic by phdru a greek freedman of augustu
in the earli year of the christian era as the modern sop is mainli
deriv from phdru the answer to the question who wrote sop is
simpl demetriu of phaleron3
1 eg jotham fabl judg ix and that of meneniu agrippa in
livi seem to be quit independ of either greek or indian
influenc but on fabl doe not make fabl
2 onli about twenti fabl howev ar known in greec befor
phdru 30 ad see my caxton sop vol i pp 2629 for a
complet enumer
3 for thi statement and what follow a refer to the pedigre of
the fabl on p 196 will be found us
in india the great ethic reform sakyamuni the buddha initi
or adopt from the brahmin the habit of us the beasttal for
moral purpos or in other word transform it into the fabl
proper a collect of these seem to have exist previous and
independ in which the fabl were associ with the name of a
mythic sage kasypa these were appropri by the earli buddhist
by the simpl expedi of make kasypa the immedi preced
incarn of the buddha a number of hi itihsa or tale were
includ in the sacr buddhist work contain the jtaka or
previousbirth of the buddha in some of which the bodisat or futur
buddha appear as on of the dramati person of the fabl the
crane eg in our wolf and crane be on of the incarn of
the buddha so too the lamb of our wolf and lamb wa onc buddha
it wa therefor easi for himso the buddhist thoughtto rememb and
tell these fabl as incid of hi former career it is obviou
that the whole idea of a fabl as an anecdot about a man masquerad
in the form of a beast could most easili aris and gain currenc where
the theori of transmigr wa vividli credit
the fabl of kasypa or rather the moral vers gatha which
serv as a memoria technica to them were probabl carri over to
ceylon in 241 bc along with the jtaka about 300 year later sai
50 ad some 100 of these were brought by a cingales embassi to
alexandria where thei were translat under the titl of libyan
fabl which had been earlier appli to similar
stori that had percol to hella from india thei were attribut
to kybis thi collect seem to have introduc the habit of
sum up the teach of a fabl in the moral correspond to the
gatha of the jtaka about the end of the first centuri ad the
libyan fabl of kybis becam known to the rabbin school at
jabn found by r jochanan ben saccai and a number of the fabl
translat into arama which ar still extant in the talmud and
midrash
in the roman world the two collect of demetriu and kybis were
brought togeth by nicostratu a rhetor attach to the court of
marcu aureliu in the earlier part of the next centuri c 230 ad
thi corpu of the ancient fabl sopic and libyan amount in all
to some 300 member wa done into greek vers with latin accentu
choliamb by valeriu babriu tutor to the young son of alexand
severu still later toward the end of the fourth centuri fortytwo
of these mainli of the libyan section were translat into latin
vers by on avian with whom the ancient histori of the fabl end
in the middl ag it wa natur the latin phdru that repres
the sopic fabl to the learn world but phdru in a fuller form
than ha descend to us in vers a select of some eighti fabl
wa turn into indiffer prose in the ninth centuri probabl at the
school of charl the great thi wa attribut to a fictiti
romulu anoth prose collect by ademar of chabann wa made
befor 1030 and still preserv some of the line of the lost fabl
of phdru the fabl becam especi popular among the norman a
number of them occur on the bayeux tapestri and in the twelfth centuri
england the head of the angevin empir becam the home of the fabl
all the import adapt and version of sop be made in thi
countri on of these done into latin vers by walter the englishman
becam the standard sop of mediev christendom the same histori
appli in larg measur to the fabl of avian which were done into
prose transfer back into latin vers and sent forth through europ
from england
meanwhil babriu had been suffer the same fate as phdru hi
scazon were turn into poor greek prose and select of them pass
to thi dai as the origin fabl of sop some fifti of these were
select and with the addit of a dozen orient fabl were
attribut to an imaginari persian sage syntipa thi collect wa
translat into syriac and thenc into arab where thei pass under
the name of the legendari lqman probabl a doublet of balaam a
still larger collect of the greek prose version got into arab
where it wa enrich by some 60 fabl from the arab bidpai and
other sourc but still pass under the name of sop thi
collect contain 164 fabl wa brought to england after the
third crusad of richard i and translat into latin by an englishman

with the invent of print the european book of sop wa compil
about 1480 by heinrich stainhwel who put togeth the romulu with
select from avian some of the greek prose version of babriu from
ranuzio translat and a few from alfr sop to these he ad
the legendari life of sop and a select of somewhat loos tale from
petru alphonsi and poggio bracciolini correspond to the milesian

waldi in germani by lestrang in england and by la fontain in
franc these were chiefli from the larger greek collect publish
after stainhwel dai and in the case of la fontain from bidpai

and the sop of modern europ is in larg measur stainhwel even to
the present dai the first three quarter of the present collect ar
stainhwel mainli in stainhwel order select from it pass into

the main truth about the former wa laid down by the masterhand of
bentlei dure a skirmish in the battl of the book the equal great
critic less began to unravel the mani knotti point connect with
the mediev latin sop hi investig have been carri on and
complet by three frenchmen in the present centuri robert du mril
and hervieux while three german crusiu benfei and mall have
thrown much need light on babriu on the orient sop and on mari
de franc lastli i have myself brought togeth these variou line
of inquiri and by ad a few thread of my own have been abl to
weav them all for the first time into a consist pattern6

vol the first contain a histori of the sopic fabl
so much for the past of the fabl ha it a futur as a mode of
literari express scarc it method is at onc too simpl and too
roundabout too roundabout for the truth we have to tell we prefer to
speak out directli and not by wai of allegori and the truth the fabl
ha to teach ar too simpl to correspond to the fact of our complex
civilis it rude graffiti of human natur cannot reproduc the
subtl gradat of modern life but as we all pass through in our
live the variou stage of ancestr cultur there come a time when
these rough sketch of life have their appeal to us as thei had for
our forefath the allegori give us a pleas and not too strenuou
stimul of the intellectu power the lesson is not too
complic for childlik mind inde in their grotesqu grace in
their quaint humour in their trust in the simpler virtu in their
insight into the cruder vice in their innoc of the fact of sex
sop fabl ar as littl children thei ar as littl children and
for that reason thei will for ever find a home in the heaven of littl
children soul
