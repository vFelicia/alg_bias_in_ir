walt whitman ha somewher a fine and just distinct between love
by allow and love with person love thi distinct appli
to book as well as to men and women and in the case of the not veri
numer author who ar the object of the person affect it
bring a curiou consequ with it there is much more differ as
to their best work than in the case of those other who ar love by
allow by convent and becaus it is felt to be the right and
proper thing to love them and in the sectfairli larg and yet
unusu choiceof austenian or janit there would probabl be
found partisan of the claim to primaci of almost everi on of the
novel to some the delight fresh and humour of northang
abbei it complet finish and entrain obscur the undoubt
critic fact that it scale is small and it scheme after all that
of burlesqu or parodi a kind in which the first rank is reach with
difficulti persuas rel faint in tone and not enthral
in interest ha devote who exalt abov all the other it exquisit
delicaci and keep the catastroph of mansfield park is admittedli
theatric the hero and heroin ar insipid and the author ha almost
wickedli destroi all romant interest by expressli admit that
edmund onli took fanni becaus mari shock him and that fanni might
veri like have taken crawford if he had been a littl more assidu
yet the matchless rehearsalscen and the charact of mr norri and
other have secur i believ a consider parti for it sens and
sensibl ha perhap the fewest outandout admir but it doe
not want them
i suppos howev that the major of at least compet vote
would all thing consid be divid between emma and the present
book and perhap the vulgar verdict if inde a fond for miss
austen be not of itself a patent of exempt from ani possibl charg
of vulgar would go for emma it is the larger the more vari the
more popular the author had by the time of it composit seen rather
more of the world and had improv her gener though not her most
peculiar and characterist dialogu such figur as miss bate as the
elton cannot but unit the suffrag of everybodi on the other hand
i for my part declar for pride and prejudic unhesitatingli it
seem to me the most perfect the most characterist the most
emin quintessenti of it author work and for thi content
in such narrow space as is permit to me i propos here to show
caus
in the first place the book it mai be bare necessari to remind the
reader wa in it first shape written veri earli somewher about 1796
when miss austen wa bare twentyon though it wa revis and
finish at chawton some fifteen year later and wa not publish till
1813 onli four year befor her death i do not know whether in thi
combin of the fresh and vigor project of youth and the
critic revis of middl life there mai be trace the distinct
superior in point of construct which as it seem to me it
possess over all the other the plot though not elabor is almost
regular enough for field hardli a charact hardli an incid
could be retrench without loss to the stori the elop of lydia
and wickham is not like that of crawford and mr rushworth a coup de
thtre it connect itself in the strictest wai with the cours of the
stori earlier and bring about the denouement with complet proprieti
all the minor passagesth love of jane and binglei the advent of mr
collin the visit to hunsford the derbyshir tourfit in after the
same unostentati but masterli fashion there is no attempt at the
hideandseek inandout busi which in the transact between
frank churchil and jane fairfax contribut no doubt a good deal to the
intrigu of emma but contribut it in a fashion which i do not think
the best featur of that otherwis admir book although miss austen
alwai like someth of the misunderstand kind which afford her
opportun for the displai of the peculiar and incompar talent to
be notic present she ha been satisfi here with the perfectli
natur occas provid by the fals account of darci conduct given
by wickham and by the awkward aris with equal natur from
the gradual transform of elizabeth own feel from posit
avers to actual love i do not know whether the allgrasp hand of
the playwright ha ever been laid upon pride and prejudic and i dare
sai that if it were the situat would prove not startl or
garish enough for the footlight the characterschem too subtl and
delic for pit and galleri but if the attempt were made it would
certainli not be hamper by ani of those loos of construct
which sometim disguis by the conveni of which the novelist can
avail himself appear at onc on the stage
i think howev though the thought will doubtless seem heret to
more than on school of critic that construct is not the highest
merit the choicest gift of the novelist it set off hi other gift
and grace most advantag to the critic ey and the want of it
will sometim mar those gracesappreci though not quit
consciouslyto ey by no mean ultracrit but a veri badlybuilt
novel which excel in pathet or humor charact or which
displai consumm command of dialogueperhap the rarest of all
facultieswould be an infinit better thing than a faultless plot
act and told by puppet with pebbl in their mouth and despit the
abil which miss austen ha shown in work out the stori i for on
should put pride and prejudic far lower if it did not contain what
seem to me the veri masterpiec of miss austen humour and of her
faculti of charactercreationmasterpiec who mai inde admit john
thorp the elton mr norri and on or two other to their compani
but who in on instanc certainli and perhap in other ar still
superior to them
the characterist of miss austen humour ar so subtl and delic
that thei ar perhap at all time easier to apprehend than to
express and at ani particular time like to be differ
apprehend by differ person to me thi humour seem to possess a
greater affin on the whole to that of addison than to ani other of
the numer speci of thi great british genu the differ of
scheme of time of subject of literari convent ar of cours
obviou enough the differ of sex doe not perhap count for much
for there wa a distinctli feminin element in mr spectat and in
jane austen geniu there wa though noth mannish much that wa
masculin but the like of qualiti consist in a great number of
common subdivis of qualitydemur extrem minut of touch
avoid of loud tone and glare effect also there is in both a
certain not inhuman or unami cruelti it is the custom with those
who judg grossli to contrast the good natur of addison with the
savageri of swift the mild of miss austen with the boister
of field and smollett even with the feroci practic joke that
her immedi predecessor miss burnei allow without veri much
protest yet both in mr addison and in miss austen there is though a
restrain and wellmann an insati and ruthless delight in
roast and cut up a fool a man in the earli eighteenth centuri
of cours could push thi tast further than a ladi in the earli
nineteenth and no doubt miss austen principl as well as her heart
would have shrunk from such thing as the letter from the unfortun
husband in the spectat who describ with all the gusto and all the
innoc in the world how hi wife and hi friend induc him to plai
at blindmansbuff but anoth spectat letterthat of the damsel
of fourteen who wish to marri mr shape and assur her select
mentor that he admir your spectat mightilymight have been
written by a rather more ladylik and intellig lydia bennet in the
dai of lydia greatgrandmoth while on the other hand some i
think unreason have found cynic in touch of miss austen
own such as her satir of mr musgrov selfdeceiv regret over
her son but thi word cynic is on of the most misus in the
english languag especi when by a glare and gratuit
falsif of it origin sens it is appli not to rough and
snarl invect but to gentl and obliqu satir if cynic mean
the percept of the other side the sens of the accept hell
beneath the conscious that motiv ar nearli alwai mix and
that to seem is not ident with to beif thi be cynic then
everi man and woman who is not a fool who doe not care to live in a
fool paradis who ha knowledg of natur and the world and life is
a cynic and in that sens miss austen certainli wa on she mai even
have been on in the further sens that like her own mr bennet she
took an epicurean delight in dissect in displai in set at
work her fool and her mean person i think she did take thi delight
and i do not think at all the wors of her for it as a woman while she
wa immens the better for it as an artist
in respect of her art gener mr goldwin smith ha truli observ
that metaphor ha been exhaust in depict the perfect of it
combin with the narrow of her field and he ha justli ad that
we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniatur
painter to make thi latter observ quit exact we must not us the
term miniatur in it restrict sens and must think rather of meml
at on end of the histori of paint and meissoni at the other than
of coswai or ani of hi kind and i am not so certain that i should
myself us the word narrow in connect with her if her world is a
microcosm the cosmic qualiti of it is at least as emin as the
littl she doe not touch what she did not feel herself call to
paint i am not so sure that she could not have paint what she did not
feel herself call to touch it is at least remark that in two veri
short period of writingon of about three year and anoth of not
much more than fivesh execut six capit work and ha not left a
singl failur it is possibl that the romant past in her
composit wa defect we must alwai rememb that hardli
anybodi born in her decadethat of the eighteenthcenturi
seventiesindepend exhibit the full romant qualiti even scott
requir hill and mountain and ballad even coleridg metaphys and
german to enabl them to chip the classic shell miss austen wa an
english girl brought up in a countri retir at the time when
ladi went back into the hous if there wa a white frost which might
pierc their kid shoe when a sudden cold wa the subject of the
gravest fear when their studi their wai their conduct were
subject to all those fantast limit and restrict against which
mari wollstonecraft protest with better gener sens than particular
tast or judgment miss austen too drew back when the white frost
touch her shoe but i think she would have made a pretti good journei
even in a black on
for if her knowledg wa not veri extend she knew two thing which
onli geniu know the on wa human and the other wa art on the
first head she could not make a mistak her men though limit ar
true and her women ar in the old sens absolut as to art if she
ha never tri ideal her realism is real to a degre which make
the fals realism of our own dai look mere deadal take almost ani
frenchman except the late m de maupass and watch him labori
pile up stroke in the hope of give a complet impress you get
none you ar lucki if discard twothird of what he give you can
shape a real impress out of the rest but with miss austen the
myriad trivial unforc stroke build up the pictur like magic
noth is fals noth is superflu when to take the present book
onli mr collin chang hi mind from jane to elizabeth while mr
bennet wa stir the fire and we know how mr bennet would have
stir the fire when mr darci brought hi coffeecup back
himself the touch in each case is like that of swifttal by the
breadth of my nailwhich impress the halfreluct thackerai with
just and outspoken admir inde fantast as it mai seem i
should put miss austen as near to swift in some wai as i have put her
to addison in other
thi swiftian qualiti appear in the present novel as it appear
nowher els in the charact of the immort the ineff mr
collin mr collin is realli great far greater than anyth addison
ever did almost great enough for field or for swift himself it ha
been said that no on ever wa like him but in the first place he
wa like him he is thereal imperish more real than hundr
of prime minist and archbishop of metal semimet and
distinguish philosoph in the second place it is rash i think
to conclud that an actual mr collin wa imposs or nonexist at
the end of the eighteenth centuri it is veri interest that we
possess in thi same galleri what mai be call a spoil first
draught or an unsuccess studi of him in john dashwood the
formal the underbreed the mean ar there but the portrait
is onli half aliv and is felt to be even a littl unnatur mr
collin is perfectli natur and perfectli aliv in fact for all the
miniatur there is someth gigant in the wai in which a certain
side and more than on of human and especi eighteenthcenturi
human it philistin it wellmean but hidebound moral
it formal petti it grovel respect for rank it materi
it selfish receiv exhibit i will not admit that on speech
or on action of thi inestim man is incap of be reconcil
with realiti and i should not wonder if mani of these word and action
ar histor true
but the great of mr collin could not have been so satisfactorili
exhibit if hi creatress had not adjust so artfulli to him the
figur of mr bennet and of ladi catherin de bourgh the latter like
mr collin himself ha been charg with exagger there is
perhap a veri faint shade of colour for the charg but it seem to me
veri faint inde even now i do not think that it would be imposs
to find person especi femal person not necessarili of nobl
birth as overbear as selfcentr as neglect of good manner
as ladi catherin a hundr year ago an earl daughter the ladi
power if not exactli bounti of an outofthewai countri parish
rich long out of marit author and so forth had opportun of
develop these agreeabl characterist which seldom present
themselv now as for mr bennet miss austen and mr darci and even
miss elizabeth herself were i am inclin to think rather hard on him
for the improprieti of hi conduct hi wife wa evid and must
alwai have been a quit irreclaim fool and unless he had shot her
or himself there wa no wai out of it for a man of sens and spirit but
the iron from no other point of view is he open to ani reproach
except for an excus and not unnatur helpless at the crisi of
the elop and hi utter ar the most acut delight in the
conscious humor kindin the kind that we laugh with not atthat
even miss austen ha put into the mouth of ani of her charact it is
difficult to know whether he is most agreeabl when talk to hi wife
or when put mr collin through hi pace but the gener sens of
the world ha probabl been right in prefer to the first rank hi
consol to the former when she maunder over the entail my dear
do not give wai to such gloomi thought let us hope for better thing
let us flatter ourselv that i mai be the survivor and hi inquiri
to hi coloss cousin as to the compliment which mr collin ha just
relat as made by himself to ladi catherin mai i ask whether these
pleas attent proce from the impuls of the moment or ar the
result of previou studi these ar the thing which give miss austen
reader the pleasant shock the delight thrill which ar felt by
the reader of swift of field and we mai here add of thackerai as
thei ar felt by the reader of no other english author of fiction
outsid of these four
the good of the minor charact in pride and prejudic ha been
alreadi allud to and it make a detail dwell on their beauti
difficult in ani space and imposs in thi mr bennet we have
glanc at and it is not easi to sai whether she is more exquisit
amus or more horribl true much the same mai be said of kitti and
lydia but it is not everi author even of geniu who would have
differenti with such uner skill the effect of folli and
vulgar of intellect and disposit work upon the common
weak of woman at such differ ag with mari miss austen ha
taken rather less pain though she ha been even more unkind to her
not mere in the text but as we learn from those interest
tradit appendic which mr austen leigh ha given us in doom
her privat to marri on of mr philipss clerk the habit of
first copi and then retail moral sentiment of plai and
sing too long in public ar no doubt grievou and crimin but
perhap poor mari wa rather the scapegoat of the sin of blue stock
in that fordycebelectur gener it is at ani rate difficult not
to extend to her a share of the respect and affect affect and
respect of a peculiar kind doubtless with which on regard mr
collin when she draw the moral of lydia fall i sometim wish
that the exig of the stori had permit miss austen to unit
these personag and thu at onc achiev a notabl mate and sooth
poor mr bennet anguish over the entail
the binglei and the gardin and the lucas miss darci and miss de
bourgh jane wickham and the rest must pass without special comment
further than the remark that charlott luca her egregi papa though
delight is just a littl on the thither side of the line between
comedi and farc is a wonderfulli clever studi in drab of on kind and
that wickham though someth of miss austen hesit of touch in
deal with young men appear is a not much less notabl sketch in
drab of anoth onli geniu could have made charlott what she is yet
not disagre wickham what he is without invest him either with
a cheap don juanish attract or a disgust rascal but the
hero and the heroin ar not tint to be dismiss
darci ha alwai seem to me by far the best and most interest of
miss austen hero the onli possibl competitor be henri tilnei
whose part is so slight and simpl that it hardli enter into
comparison it ha sometim i believ been urg that hi pride is
unnatur at first in it express and later in it yield while
hi fall in love at all is not extrem probabl here again i
cannot go with the objector darci own account of the wai in which
hi pride had been pamper is perfectli ration and suffici and
noth could be psycholog speak a causa verior for it
sudden restor to healthi condit than the shock of elizabeth
scorn refus act on a natur ex hypothesi gener noth in
even our author is finer and more delic touch than the chang of
hi demeanour at the sudden meet in the ground of pemberlei had he
been a bad prig or a bad coxcomb he might have been still smart
under hi reject or suspici that the girl had come
husbandhunt hi be neither is exactli consist with the
probabl feel of a man spoilt in the common sens but not realli
injur in disposit and thoroughli in love as for hi be in
love elizabeth ha given as just an exposit of the caus of that
phenomenon as darci ha of the condit of hi unregener state
onli she ha of cours not count in what wa due to her own person
charm
the secret of that charm mani men and not a few women from miss austen
herself downward have felt and like most charm it is a thing rather
to be felt than to be explain elizabeth of cours belong to the
allegro or allegra divis of the armi of venu miss austen wa
alwai provokingli chari of descript in regard to her beauti and
except the fine ey and a hint or two that she had at ani rate
sometim a bright complexion and wa not veri tall we hear noth
about her look but her chief differ from other heroin of the
live type seem to lie first in her be distinctli cleveralmost
strongmind in the better sens of that objection wordand
secondli in her be entir destitut of illnatur for all her
propens to teas and the sharp of her tongu elizabeth can give
at least as good as she get when she is attack but she never
scratch and she never attack first some of the merest
obsolet of phrase and manner give on or two of her earli
speech a slight pert but that is noth and when she come to
seriou busi as in the great propos scene with darci which is
as it should be the climax of the interest of the book and in the
final ladi battl with ladi catherin she is unexception then
too she is a perfectli natur girl she doe not disguis from herself
or anybodi that she resent darci first illmann person with
as person a feel by the wai the reproach that the illmann of
thi speech ar overdon is certainli unjust for thing of the same
kind express no doubt less stiltedli but more coars might have
been heard in more than on ballroom dure thi veri year from person
who ought to have been no wors bred than darci and she let the
injuri done to jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her famili
aggrav thi resent in the healthiest wai in the world
still all thi doe not explain her charm which take beauti as a
common form of all heroin mai perhap consist in the addit to her
play her wit her affection and natur disposit of a
certain fearless veri uncommon in heroin of her type and ag
nearli all of them would have been in speechless aw of the magnific
darci nearli all of them would have palpit and flutter at the
idea of propos even naughti on from the fascin wickham
elizabeth with noth offens noth viragin noth of the
new woman about her ha by natur what the best modern not new
women have by educ and experi a perfect freedom from the idea
that all men mai bulli her if thei choos and that most will awai with
her if thei can though not in the least impud and mannish grown
she ha no mere sensibl no nasti nice about her the form of
passion common and like to seem natur in miss austen dai wa so
invari connect with the displai of on or the other or both of
these qualiti that she ha not made elizabeth outwardli passion
but i at least have not the slightest doubt that she would have
marri darci just as willingli without pemberlei as with it and
anybodi who can read between line will not find the lover
convers in the final chapter so frigid as thei might have look
to the della cruscan of their own dai and perhap do look to the della
cruscan of thi
and after all what is the good of seek for the reason of
charmit is there there were better sens in the sad mechan
exercis of determin the reason of it absenc where it is not in
the novel of the last hundr year there ar vast number of young
ladi with whom it might be a pleasur to fall in love there ar at
least five with whom as it seem to me no man of tast and spirit can
help do so their name ar in chronolog order elizabeth
bennet diana vernon argemon lavington beatrix esmond and barbara
grant i should have been most in love with beatrix and argemon i
should i think for mere occasion companionship have prefer diana
and barbara but to live with and to marri i do not know that ani on
of the four can come into competit with elizabeth

it is a truth univers acknowledg that a singl man in possess
of a good fortun must be in want of a wife
howev littl known the feel or view of such a man mai be on hi
first enter a neighbourhood thi truth is so well fix in the mind
of the surround famili that he is consid as the right
properti of some on or other of their daughter
my dear mr bennet said hi ladi to him on dai have you heard that
netherfield park is let at last
mr bennet repli that he had not

told me all about it
mr bennet made no answer
do not you want to know who ha taken it cri hi wife impati
you want to tell me and i have no object to hear it
illustr
he came down to see the place
copyright 1894 by georg allen
thi wa invit enough
why my dear you must know mr long sai that netherfield is taken
by a young man of larg fortun from the north of england that he came
down on mondai in a chais and four to see the place and wa so much
delight with it that he agre with mr morri immedi that he is
to take possess befor michaelma and some of hi servant ar to be
in the hous by the end of next week
what is hi name
binglei
is he marri or singl
oh singl my dear to be sure a singl man of larg fortun four or
five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girl
how so how can it affect them
my dear mr bennet repli hi wife how can you be so tiresom you
must know that i am think of hi marri on of them
is that hi design in settl here
design nonsens how can you talk so but it is veri like that he
mai fall in love with on of them and therefor you must visit him as
soon as he come
i see no occas for that you and the girl mai goor you mai send
them by themselv which perhap will be still better for as you ar
as handsom as ani of them mr binglei might like you the best of the
parti
my dear you flatter me i certainli have had my share of beauti but
i do not pretend to be anyth extraordinari now when a woman ha five
grownup daughter she ought to give over think of her own beauti
in such case a woman ha not often much beauti to think of
but my dear you must inde go and see mr binglei when he come into
the neighbourhood
it is more than i engag for i assur you
but consid your daughter onli think what an establish it would
be for on of them sir william and ladi luca ar determin to go
mere on that account for in gener you know thei visit no new
comer inde you must go for it will be imposs for us to visit
him if you do not
you ar over scrupul sure i dare sai mr binglei will be veri
glad to see you and i will send a few line by you to assur him of my
hearti consent to hi marri whichev he choos of the girlsthough
i must throw in a good word for my littl lizzi
i desir you will do no such thing lizzi is not a bit better than the
other and i am sure she is not half so handsom as jane nor half so
goodhumour as lydia but you ar alwai give her the prefer
thei have none of them much to recommend them repli he thei ar
all silli and ignor like other girl but lizzi ha someth more of
quick than her sister
mr bennet how can you abus your own children in such a wai you take
delight in vex me you have no compass on my poor nerv
you mistak me my dear i have a high respect for your nerv thei
ar my old friend i have heard you mention them with consider
these twenti year at least
ah you do not know what i suffer
but i hope you will get over it and live to see mani young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood
it will be no us to us if twenti such should come sinc you will not
visit them
depend upon it my dear that when there ar twenti i will visit them
all
mr bennet wa so odd a mixtur of quick part sarcast humour
reserv and capric that the experi of threeandtwenti year had
been insuffici to make hi wife understand hi charact her mind
wa less difficult to develop she wa a woman of mean understand
littl inform and uncertain temper when she wa discont she

elizabeth listen in silenc but wa not convinc their behaviour at

quick of observ and less plianci of temper than her sister and
with a judgment too unassail by ani attent to herself she wa

thousand pound from hi father who had intend to purchas an estat
but did not live to do it mr binglei intend it likewis and
sometim made choic of hi counti but as he wa now provid with a
good hous and the liberti of a manor it wa doubt to mani of those
who best knew the easi of hi temper whether he might not spend the
remaind of hi dai at netherfield and leav the next gener to

hi sister were veri anxiou for hi have an estat of hi own but
though he wa now establish onli as a tenant miss binglei wa by no
mean unwil to presid at hi tabl nor wa mr hurst who had
marri a man of more fashion than fortun less dispos to consid
hi hous as her home when it suit her mr binglei had not been of

look at netherfield hous he did look at it and into it for half an
hour wa pleas with the situat and the princip room satisfi
with what the owner said in it prais and took it immedi
between him and darci there wa a veri steadi friendship in spite of a
great opposit of charact binglei wa endear to darci by the
easi open and ductil of hi temper though no disposit
could offer a greater contrast to hi own and though with hi own he
never appear dissatisfi on the strength of darci regard binglei
had the firmest relianc and of hi judgment the highest opinion in

defici but darci wa clever he wa at the same time haughti
reserv and fastidi and hi manner though well bred were not
invit in that respect hi friend had greatli the advantag binglei

the manner in which thei spoke of the meryton assembl wa suffici
characterist binglei had never met with pleasant peopl or prettier
girl in hi life everybodi had been most kind and attent to him
there had been no formal no stiff he had soon felt acquaint
with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceiv an angel
more beauti darci on the contrari had seen a collect of peopl
in whom there wa littl beauti and no fashion for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest and from none receiv either attent or

mr hurst and her sister allow it to be so but still thei admir

that the miss lucas and the miss bennet should meet to talk over a

brought the former to longbourn to hear and to commun
you began the even well charlott said mr bennet with civil

oh you mean jane i suppos becaus he danc with her twice to be

about mr robinson
perhap you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not
i mention it to you mr robinson ask him how he like our meryton
assembl and whether he did not think there were a great mani pretti
women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and hi
answer immedi to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet
beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinion on that point
upon my word well that wa veri decid indeedthat doe seem as

ay becaus she ask him at last how he like netherfield and he
could not help answer her but she said he seem veri angri at be
spoke to
miss binglei told me said jane that he never speak much unless
among hi intim acquaint with them he is remark
agreeabl
i do not believ a word of it my dear if he had been so veri
agreeabl he would have talk to mr long but i can guess how it
wa everybodi sai that he is eat up with pride and i dare sai he had
heard somehow that mr long doe not keep a carriag and had to come
to the ball in a hack chais
i do not mind hi not talk to mr long said miss luca but i
wish he had danc with eliza
anoth time lizzi said her mother i would not danc with him
if i were you
i believ maam i mai safe promis you never to danc with him
hi pride said miss luca doe not offend me so much as pride
often doe becaus there is an excus for it on cannot wonder that so
veri fine a young man with famili fortun everyth in hi favour
should think highli of himself if i mai so express it he ha a right
to be proud
that is veri true repli elizabeth and i could easili forgiv
hi pride if he had not mortifi mine
pride observ mari who piqu herself upon the solid of her
reflect is a veri common fail i believ by all that i have
ever read i am convinc that it is veri common inde that human
natur is particularli prone to it and that there ar veri few of us
who do not cherish a feel of selfcomplac on the score of some
qualiti or other real or imaginari vaniti and pride ar differ
thing though the word ar often us synonym a person mai be
proud without be vain pride relat more to our opinion of
ourselv vaniti to what we would have other think of us
if i were as rich as mr darci cri a young luca who came with hi
sister i should not care how proud i wa i would keep a pack of

wa return in due form miss bennet pleas manner grew on the
goodwil of mr hurst and miss binglei and though the mother wa
found to be intoler and the younger sister not worth speak to
a wish of be better acquaint with them wa express toward the
two eldest by jane thi attent wa receiv with the greatest
pleasur but elizabeth still saw supercili in their treatment of
everybodi hardli except even her sister and could not like them
though their kind to jane such as it wa had a valu as aris
in all probabl from the influenc of their brother admir it
wa gener evid whenev thei met that he did admir her and
to her it wa equal evid that jane wa yield to the prefer
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and wa in a
wai to be veri much in love but she consid with pleasur that it
wa not like to be discov by the world in gener sinc jane
unit with great strength of feel a composur of temper and an
uniform cheer of manner which would guard her from the
suspicion of the impertin she mention thi to her friend miss
luca
it mai perhap be pleasant repli charlott to be abl to impos
on the public in such a case but it is sometim a disadvantag to be
so veri guard if a woman conceal her affect with the same skill
from the object of it she mai lose the opportun of fix him and
it will then be but poor consol to believ the world equal in the
dark there is so much of gratitud or vaniti in almost everi
attach that it is not safe to leav ani to itself we can all
begin freelya slight prefer is natur enough but there ar
veri few of us who have heart enough to be realli in love without
encourag in nine case out of ten a woman had better show more
affect than she feel binglei like your sister undoubtedli but he
mai never do more than like her if she doe not help him on
but she doe help him on as much as her natur will allow if i can
perceiv her regard for him he must be a simpleton inde not to
discov it too
rememb eliza that he doe not know jane disposit as you do
but if a woman is partial to a man and doe not endeavor to conceal
it he must find it out
perhap he must if he see enough of her but though binglei and jane
meet toler often it is never for mani hour togeth and as thei
alwai see each other in larg mix parti it is imposs that
everi moment should be emploi in convers togeth jane should
therefor make the most of everi half hour in which she can command hi
attent when she is secur of him there will be leisur for fall
in love as much as she choos
your plan is a good on repli elizabeth where noth is in
question but the desir of be well marri and if i were determin
to get a rich husband or ani husband i dare sai i should adopt it but
these ar not jane feel she is not act by design as yet she
cannot even be certain of the degre of her own regard nor of it
reason she ha known him onli a fortnight she danc four
danc with him at meryton she saw him on morn at hi own hous
and ha sinc dine in compani with him four time thi is not quit
enough to make her understand hi charact
not as you repres it had she mere dine with him she might
onli have discov whether he had a good appetit but you must
rememb that four even have been also spent togetherand four
even mai do a great deal
ye these four even have enabl them to ascertain that thei both
like vingtun better than commerc but with respect to ani other
lead characterist i do not imagin that much ha been unfold
well said charlott i wish jane success with all my heart and if
she were marri to him tomorrow i should think she had as good a
chanc of happi as if she were to be studi hi charact for a
twelvemonth happi in marriag is entir a matter of chanc if
the disposit of the parti ar ever so well known to each other or
ever so similar beforehand it doe not advanc their felic in the
least thei alwai continu to grow suffici unlik afterward to
have their share of vexat and it is better to know as littl as
possibl of the defect of the person with whom you ar to pass your
life
you make me laugh charlott but it is not sound you know it is not
sound and that you would never act in thi wai yourself
occupi in observ mr binglei attent to her sister elizabeth
wa far from suspect that she wa herself becom an object of some
interest in the ey of hi friend mr darci had at first scarc

sooner had he made it clear to himself and hi friend that she had
hardli a good featur in her face than he began to find it wa render
uncommonli intellig by the beauti express of her dark ey to
thi discoveri succeed some other equal mortifi though he had
detect with a critic ey more than on failur of perfect symmetri
in her form he wa forc to acknowledg her figur to be light and
pleas and in spite of hi assert that her manner were not those
of the fashion world he wa caught by their easi play of
thi she wa perfectli unawar to her he wa onli the man who made
himself agreeabl nowher and who had not thought her handsom enough

with her himself attend to her convers with other hi do so
drew her notic it wa at sir william lucass where a larg parti were

what doe mr darci mean said she to charlott by listen to my

that is a question which mr darci onli can answer

mr bennet properti consist almost entir in an estat of two
thousand a year which unfortun for hi daughter wa entail
in default of heir male on a distant relat and their mother
fortun though ampl for her situat in life could but ill suppli
the defici of hi her father had been an attornei in meryton and
had left her four thousand pound
she had a sister marri to a mr philip who had been a clerk to their
father and succeed him in the busi and a brother settl in
london in a respect line of trade
the villag of longbourn wa onli on mile from meryton a most
conveni distanc for the young ladi who were usual tempt
thither three or four time a week to pai their duti to their aunt and
to a millin shop just over the wai the two youngest of the famili
catherin and lydia were particularli frequent in these attent
their mind were more vacant than their sister and when noth
better offer a walk to meryton wa necessari to amus their morn
hour and furnish convers for the even and howev bare of
new the countri in gener might be thei alwai contriv to learn
some from their aunt at present inde thei were well suppli both
with new and happi by the recent arriv of a militia regiment in
the neighbourhood it wa to remain the whole winter and meryton wa
the headquart
their visit to mr philip were now product of the most interest
intellig everi dai ad someth to their knowledg of the
offic name and connect their lodg were not long a secret
and at length thei began to know the offic themselv mr philip
visit them all and thi open to hi niec a sourc of felic
unknown befor thei could talk of noth but offic and mr
binglei larg fortun the mention of which gave anim to their
mother wa worthless in their ey when oppos to the regiment of
an ensign
after listen on morn to their effus on thi subject mr
bennet coolli observ
from all that i can collect by your manner of talk you must be two
of the silliest girl in the countri i have suspect it some time but
i am now convinc
catherin wa disconcert and made no answer but lydia with perfect
indiffer continu to express her admir of captain carter and
her hope of see him in the cours of the dai as he wa go the
next morn to london
i am astonish my dear said mr bennet that you should be so
readi to think your own children silli if i wish to think slightingli
of anybodi children it should not be of my own howev
if my children ar silli i must hope to be alwai sensibl of it
ye but as it happen thei ar all of them veri clever
thi is the onli point i flatter myself on which we do not agre i
had hope that our sentiment coincid in everi particular but i must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughter uncommonli
foolish
my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girl to have the sens of
their father and mother when thei get to our ag i dare sai thei will
not think about offic ani more than we do i rememb the time when i
like a red coat myself veri welland inde so i do still at my
heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year
should want on of my girl i shall not sai nai to him and i thought
colonel forster look veri becom the other night at sir william in
hi regiment
mamma cri lydia my aunt sai that colonel forster and captain
carter do not go so often to miss watson as thei did when thei first
came she see them now veri often stand in clark librari
mr bennet wa prevent repli by the entranc of the footman with a
note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant wait
for an answer mr bennet ey sparkl with pleasur and she wa
eagerli call out while her daughter read
well jane who is it from what is it about what doe he sai well
jane make hast and tell us make hast my love
it is from miss binglei said jane and then read it aloud
nind my dear friend
if you ar not so compassion as to dine todai with louisa and
me we shall be in danger of hate each other for the rest of our
live for a whole dai ttett between two women can never
end without a quarrel come as soon as you can on the receipt of
thi my brother and the gentlemen ar to dine with the offic
your ever

with the offic cri lydia i wonder my aunt did not tell us of

can i have the carriag said jane
no my dear you had better go on horseback becaus it seem like to
rain and then you must stai all night
that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that
thei would not offer to send her home
oh but the gentlemen will have mr binglei chais to go to meryton
and the hurst have no hors to their
i had much rather go in the coach
but my dear your father cannot spare the hors i am sure thei ar
want in the farm mr bennet ar not thei
illustr cheer prognost
thei ar want in the farm much often than i can get them
but if you have got them todai said elizabeth my mother purpos
will be answer
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledg that the hors
were engag jane wa therefor oblig to go on horseback and her
mother attend her to the door with mani cheer prognost of a bad
dai her hope were answer jane had not been gone long befor it
rain hard her sister were uneasi for her but her mother wa
delight the rain continu the whole even without intermiss
jane certainli could not come back
thi wa a lucki idea of mine inde said mr bennet more than
onc as if the credit of make it rain were all her own till the next
morn howev she wa not awar of all the felic of her
contriv breakfast wa scarc over when a servant from netherfield
brought the follow note for elizabeth

trifl cold she will be taken good care of as long as she stai
there it is all veri well i would go and see her if i could have the
carriag

hors
no inde i do not wish to avoid the walk the distanc is noth
when on ha a motiv onli three mile i shall be back by dinner
i admir the activ of your benevol observ mari but everi
impuls of feel should be guid by reason and in my opinion
exert should alwai be in proport to what is requir
we will go as far as meryton with you said catherin and lydia
elizabeth accept their compani and the three young ladi set off
togeth
if we make hast said lydia as thei walk along perhap we mai

field after field at a quick pace jump over stile and spring
over puddl with impati activ and find herself at last
within view of the hous with weari ancl dirti stock and a face
glow with the warmth of exercis
she wa shown into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were
assembl and where her appear creat a great deal of surpris
that she should have walk three mile so earli in the dai in such
dirti weather and by herself wa almost incred to mr hurst and
miss binglei and elizabeth wa convinc that thei held her in contempt
for it she wa receiv howev veri polit by them and in their
brother manner there wa someth better than politenessther wa
goodhumour and kind mr darci said veri littl and mr hurst
noth at all the former wa divid between admir of the
brillianc which exercis had given to her complexion and doubt as to
the occas justifi her come so far alon the latter wa
think onli of hi breakfast
her inquiri after her sister were not veri favour answer miss
bennet had slept ill and though up wa veri feverish and not well
enough to leav her room elizabeth wa glad to be taken to her
immedi and jane who had onli been withheld by the fear of give
alarm or inconveni from express in her note how much she long
for such a visit wa delight at her entranc she wa not equal
howev to much convers and when miss binglei left them togeth
could attempt littl besid express of gratitud for the
extraordinari kind she wa treat with elizabeth silent attend

began to like them herself when she saw how much affect and
solicitud thei show for jane the apothecari came and have
examin hi patient said as might be suppos that she had caught a
violent cold and that thei must endeavour to get the better of it

ach acut elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were
the other ladi often absent the gentlemen be out thei had in fact

unwillingli said so miss binglei offer her the carriag and she onli
want a littl press to accept it when jane testifi such concern

she had no convers no style no tast no beauti mr hurst
thought the same and ad
she ha noth in short to recommend her but be an excel
walker i shall never forget her appear thi morn she realli
look almost wild
she did inde louisa i could hardli keep my counten veri
nonsens to come at all why must she be scamper about the
countri becaus her sister had a cold her hair so untidi so blowzi

in mud i am absolut certain and the gown which had been let down to
hide it not do it offic
your pictur mai be veri exact louisa said binglei but thi wa
all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet look remark well
when she came into the room thi morn her dirti petticoat quit

abov her ancl in dirt and alon quit alon what could she mean by
it it seem to me to show an abomin sort of conceit independ
a most countrytown indiffer to decorum
it show an affect for her sister that is veri pleas said
binglei
i am afraid mr darci observ miss binglei in a half whisper
that thi adventur ha rather affect your admir of her fine
ey
not at all he repli thei were brighten by the exercis a
short paus follow thi speech and mr hurst began again
i have an excess regard for jane bennetsh is realli a veri sweet
girland i wish with all my heart she were well settl but with such
a father and mother and such low connect i am afraid there is no
chanc of it
i think i have heard you sai that their uncl is an attornei in
meryton
ye and thei have anoth who live somewher near cheapsid
that is capit ad her sister and thei both laugh heartili
if thei had uncl enough to fill all cheapsid cri binglei it
would not make them on jot less agreeabl
but it must veri materi lessen their chanc of marri men of ani
consider in the world repli darci
to thi speech binglei made no answer but hi sister gave it their
hearti assent and indulg their mirth for some time at the expens of
their dear friend vulgar relat
with a renew of tender howev thei repair to her room on
leav the diningparlour and sat with her till summon to coffe
she wa still veri poorli and elizabeth would not quit her at all till
late in the even when she had the comfort of see her asleep and
when it appear to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
down stair herself on enter the drawingroom she found the whole
parti at loo and wa immedi invit to join them but suspect
them to be plai high she declin it and make her sister the
excus said she would amus herself for the short time she could stai
below with a book mr hurst look at her with astonish
do you prefer read to card said he that is rather singular
miss eliza bennet said miss binglei despis card she is a great
reader and ha no pleasur in anyth els
i deserv neither such prais nor such censur cri elizabeth i
am not a great reader and i have pleasur in mani thing
in nurs your sister i am sure you have pleasur said binglei and
i hope it will soon be increas by see her quit well
elizabeth thank him from her heart and then walk toward a tabl
where a few book were ly he immedi offer to fetch her
other all that hi librari afford
and i wish my collect were larger for your benefit and my own
credit but i am an idl fellow and though i have not mani i have more
than i ever look into
elizabeth assur him that she could suit herself perfectli with those
in the room
i am astonish said miss binglei that my father should have left
so small a collect of book what a delight librari you have at
pemberlei mr darci
it ought to be good he repli it ha been the work of mani
gener
and then you have ad so much to it yourselfy ar alwai bui
book
i cannot comprehend the neglect of a famili librari in such dai as
these
neglect i am sure you neglect noth that can add to the beauti of
that nobl place charl when you build your hous i wish it mai be
half as delight as pemberlei
i wish it mai
but i would realli advis you to make your purchas in that
neighbourhood and take pemberlei for a kind of model there is not a
finer counti in england than derbyshir
with all my heart i will bui pemberlei itself if darci will sell it
i am talk of possibl charl
upon my word carolin i should think it more possibl to get
pemberlei by purchas than by imit
elizabeth wa so much caught by what pass as to leav her veri littl
attent for her book and soon lai it wholli asid she drew near
the cardtabl and station herself between mr binglei and hi eldest
sister to observ the game
is miss darci much grown sinc the spring said miss binglei will
she be as tall as i am
i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennet height or
rather taller
how i long to see her again i never met with anybodi who delight me
so much such a counten such manner and so extrem accomplish
for her ag her perform on the pianofort is exquisit
it is amaz to me said binglei how young ladi can have patienc
to be so veri accomplish as thei all ar
all young ladi accomplish my dear charl what do you mean
ye all of them i think thei all paint tabl cover screen and
net purs i scarc know ani on who cannot do all thi and i am
sure i never heard a young ladi spoken of for the first time without
be inform that she wa veri accomplish
your list of the common extent of accomplish said darci ha
too much truth the word is appli to mani a woman who deserv it no
otherwis than by net a purs or cover a screen but i am veri
far from agre with you in your estim of ladi in gener i
cannot boast of know more than halfadozen in the whole rang of my
acquaint that ar realli accomplish
nor i i am sure said miss binglei
then observ elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplish woman
ye i do comprehend a great deal in it
oh certainli cri hi faith assist no on can be realli
esteem accomplish who doe not greatli surpass what is usual met
with a woman must have a thorough knowledg of music sing draw
danc and the modern languag to deserv the word and besid all
thi she must possess a certain someth in her air and manner of
walk the tone of her voic her address and express or the word
will be but half deserv
all thi she must possess ad darci and to all she must yet add
someth more substanti in the improv of her mind by extens
read
i am no longer surpris at your know onli six accomplish women
i rather wonder now at your know ani
ar you so sever upon your own sex as to doubt the possibl of all
thi
i never saw such a woman i never saw such capac and tast and
applic and eleg as you describ unit
mr hurst and miss binglei both cri out against the injustic of her
impli doubt and were both protest that thei knew mani women who
answer thi descript when mr hurst call them to order with
bitter complaint of their inattent to what wa go forward as all
convers wa therebi at an end elizabeth soon afterward left the
room
eliza bennet said miss binglei when the door wa close on her is
on of those young ladi who seek to recommend themselv to the other
sex by undervalu their own and with mani men i daresai it
succe but in my opinion it is a paltri devic a veri mean art
undoubtedli repli darci to whom thi remark wa chiefli address
there is mean in all the art which ladi sometim condescend

miss binglei wa not so entir satisfi with thi repli as to

elizabeth join them again onli to sai that her sister wa wors and

own judgment of her situat the note wa immedi despatch and
it content as quickli compli with mr bennet accompani by her
two youngest girl reach netherfield soon after the famili breakfast
had she found jane in ani appar danger mr bennet would have been
veri miser but be satisfi on see her that her ill wa
not alarm she had no wish of her recov immedi as her
restor to health would probabl remov her from netherfield she
would not listen therefor to her daughter propos of be carri
home neither did the apothecari who arriv about the same time think
it at all advis after sit a littl while with jane on miss
binglei appear and invit the mother and three daughter all
attend her into the breakfast parlour binglei met them with hope
that mr bennet had not found miss bennet wors than she expect
inde i have sir wa her answer she is a great deal too ill to be
move mr jone sai we must not think of move her we must trespass
a littl longer on your kind
remov cri binglei it must not be thought of my sister i am
sure will not hear of her remov
you mai depend upon it madam said miss binglei with cold civil
that miss bennet shall receiv everi possibl attent while she
remain with us
mr bennet wa profus in her acknowledg
i am sure she ad if it wa not for such good friend i do not
know what would becom of her for she is veri ill inde and suffer a
vast deal though with the greatest patienc in the world which is
alwai the wai with her for she ha without except the sweetest
temper i ever met with i often tell my other girl thei ar noth to
her you have a sweet room here mr binglei and a charm prospect
over that gravel walk i do not know a place in the countri that is
equal to netherfield you will not think of quit it in a hurri i
hope though you have but a short leas
whatev i do is done in a hurri repli he and therefor if i
should resolv to quit netherfield i should probabl be off in five
minut at present howev i consid myself as quit fix here
that is exactli what i should have suppos of you said elizabeth
you begin to comprehend me do you cri he turn toward her
oh yesi understand you perfectli
i wish i might take thi for a compliment but to be so easili seen
through i am afraid is piti
that is as it happen it doe not necessarili follow that a deep
intric charact is more or less estim than such a on as your
lizzi cri her mother rememb where you ar and do not run on in
the wild manner that you ar suffer to do at home
i did not know befor continu binglei immedi that you were
a studier of charact it must be an amus studi
ye but intric charact ar the most amus thei have at
least that advantag
the countri said darci can in gener suppli but few subject for
such a studi in a countri neighbourhood you move in a veri confin and
unvari societi
but peopl themselv alter so much that there is someth new to be
observ in them for ever
ye inde cri mr bennet offend by hi manner of mention a
countri neighbourhood i assur you there is quit as much of that
go on in the countri as in town
everybodi wa surpris and darci after look at her for a moment
turn silent awai mr bennet who fanci she had gain a complet
victori over him continu her triumph
i cannot see that london ha ani great advantag over the countri for
my part except the shop and public place the countri is a vast deal
pleasant is not it mr binglei
when i am in the countri he repli i never wish to leav it and
when i am in town it is pretti much the same thei have each their
advantag and i can be equal happi in either
ay that is becaus you have the right disposit but that
gentleman look at darci seem to think the countri wa noth
at all
inde mamma you ar mistaken said elizabeth blush for her
mother you quit mistook mr darci he onli meant that there wa not
such a varieti of peopl to be met with in the countri as in town which
you must acknowledg to be true
certainli my dear nobodi said there were but as to not meet with
mani peopl in thi neighbourhood i believ there ar few
neighbourhood larger i know we dine with fourandtwenti famili
noth but concern for elizabeth could enabl binglei to keep hi
counten hi sister wa less delic and direct her ey toward
mr darci with a veri express smile elizabeth for the sake of
sai someth that might turn her mother thought now ask her if
charlott luca had been at longbourn sinc her come awai
ye she call yesterdai with her father what an agreeabl man sir
william is mr bingleyi not he so much the man of fashion so
genteel and so easi he ha alwai someth to sai to everybodi that
is my idea of good breed and those person who fanci themselv veri
import and never open their mouth quit mistak the matter
did charlott dine with you
no she would go home i fanci she wa want about the mincepi for
my part mr binglei i alwai keep servant that can do their own
work my daughter ar brought up differ but everybodi is to
judg for themselv and the lucas ar a veri good sort of girl i
assur you it is a piti thei ar not handsom not that i think
charlott so veri plain but then she is our particular friend
she seem a veri pleasant young woman said binglei
oh dear ye but you must own she is veri plain ladi luca herself
ha often said so and envi me jane beauti i do not like to boast
of my own child but to be sure janeon doe not often see anybodi
better look it is what everybodi sai i do not trust my own
partial when she wa onli fifteen there wa a gentleman at my
brother gardin in town so much in love with her that my
sisterinlaw wa sure he would make her an offer befor we came awai
but howev he did not perhap he thought her too young howev he
wrote some vers on her and veri pretti thei were
and so end hi affect said elizabeth impati there ha
been mani a on i fanci overcom in the same wai i wonder who first
discov the efficaci of poetri in drive awai love
i have been us to consid poetri as the food of love said darci
of a fine stout healthi love it mai everyth nourish what is
strong alreadi but if it be onli a slight thin sort of inclin i
am convinc that on good sonnet will starv it entir awai
darci onli smile and the gener paus which ensu made elizabeth
trembl lest her mother should be expos herself again she long to
speak but could think of noth to sai and after a short silenc mr
bennet began repeat her thank to mr binglei for hi kind to
jane with an apolog for troubl him also with lizzi mr binglei wa
unaffectedli civil in hi answer and forc hi younger sister to be
civil also and sai what the occas requir she perform her part

the dai pass much as the dai befor had done mr hurst and miss
binglei had spent some hour of the morn with the invalid who
continu though slowli to mend and in the even elizabeth join
their parti in the drawingroom the loo tabl howev did not appear
mr darci wa write and miss binglei seat near him wa watch
the progress of hi letter and repeatedli call off hi attent by
messag to hi sister mr hurst and mr binglei were at piquet and
mr hurst wa observ their game
elizabeth took up some needlework and wa suffici amus in
attend to what pass between darci and hi companion the perpetu
commend of the ladi either on hi handwrit or on the even
of hi line or on the length of hi letter with the perfect unconcern
with which her prais were receiv form a curiou dialogu and wa
exactli in unison with her opinion of each
how delight miss darci will be to receiv such a letter
he made no answer
you write uncommonli fast
you ar mistaken i write rather slowli
how mani letter you must have occas to write in the cours of a
year letter of busi too how odiou i should think them
it is fortun then that thei fall to my lot instead of to your
prai tell your sister that i long to see her
i have alreadi told her so onc by your desir
i am afraid you do not like your pen let me mend it for you i mend
pen remark well
thank youbut i alwai mend my own
how can you contriv to write so even
he wa silent
tell your sister i am delight to hear of her improv on the harp
and prai let her know that i am quit in raptur with her beauti
littl design for a tabl and i think it infinit superior to miss
grantlei
will you give me leav to defer your raptur till i write again at
present i have not room to do them justic
oh it is of no consequ i shall see her in januari but do you
alwai write such charm long letter to her mr darci
thei ar gener long but whether alwai charm it is not for me
to determin
it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with
eas cannot write ill
that will not do for a compliment to darci carolin cri her
brother becaus he doe not write with eas he studi too much
for word of four syllabl do not you darci
my style of write is veri differ from your
oh cri miss binglei charl write in the most careless wai
imagin he leav out half hi word and blot the rest
my idea flow so rapidli that i have not time to express them by which
mean my letter sometim convei no idea at all to my correspond
your humil mr binglei said elizabeth must disarm reproof
noth is more deceit said darci than the appear of
humil it is often onli careless of opinion and sometim an
indirect boast
and which of the two do you call my littl recent piec of modesti
the indirect boast for you ar realli proud of your defect in
write becaus you consid them as proceed from a rapid of
thought and careless of execut which if not estim you
think at least highli interest the power of do anyth with
quick is alwai much prize by the possessor and often without ani
attent to the imperfect of the perform when you told mr
bennet thi morn that if you ever resolv on quit netherfield
you should be gone in five minut you meant it to be a sort of
panegyr of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so veri
laudabl in a precipit which must leav veri necessari busi
undon and can be of no real advantag to yourself or anyon els
nai cri binglei thi is too much to rememb at night all the
foolish thing that were said in the morn and yet upon my honour i
believ what i said of myself to be true and i believ it at thi
moment at least therefor i did not assum the charact of needless
precipit mere to show off befor the ladi
i daresai you believ it but i am by no mean convinc that you
would be gone with such celer your conduct would be quit as
depend on chanc as that of ani man i know and if as you were
mount your hors a friend were to sai binglei you had better stai
till next week you would probabl do ityou would probabl not
goand at anoth word might stai a month
you have onli prove by thi cri elizabeth that mr binglei did
not do justic to hi own disposit you have shown him off now much
more than he did himself
i am exceedingli gratifi said binglei by your convert what my
friend sai into a compliment on the sweet of my temper but i am
afraid you ar give it a turn which that gentleman did by no mean
intend for he would certainli think the better of me if under such a
circumst i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i
could
would mr darci then consid the rash of your origin intent
as aton for by your obstinaci in adher to it
upon my word i cannot exactli explain the matterdarci must speak for
himself
you expect me to account for opinion which you choos to call mine
but which i have never acknowledg allow the case howev to
stand accord to your represent you must rememb miss bennet
that the friend who is suppos to desir hi return to the hous and
the delai of hi plan ha mere desir it ask it without offer
on argument in favour of it proprieti
to yield readilyeasilyto the persuas of a friend is no merit
with you
to yield without convict is no compliment to the understand of
either
you appear to me mr darci to allow noth for the influenc of
friendship and affect a regard for the request would often make
on readili yield to a request without wait for argument to reason
on into it i am not particularli speak of such a case as you have
suppos about mr binglei we mai as well wait perhap till the
circumst occur befor we discuss the discret of hi behaviour
thereupon but in gener and ordinari case between friend and friend
where on of them is desir by the other to chang a resolut of no
veri great moment should you think ill of that person for compli
with the desir without wait to be argu into it
will it not be advis befor we proce on thi subject to arrang
with rather more precis the degre of import which is to
appertain to thi request as well as the degre of intimaci subsist
between the parti
by all mean cri binglei let us hear all the particular not
forget their compar height and size for that will have more
weight in the argument miss bennet than you mai be awar of i assur
you that if darci were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with
myself i should not pai him half so much defer i declar i do not
know a more aw object than darci on particular occas and in
particular place at hi own hous especi and of a sundai even
when he ha noth to do
mr darci smile but elizabeth thought she could perceiv that he wa
rather offend and therefor check her laugh miss binglei warmli
resent the indign he had receiv in an expostul with her
brother for talk such nonsens
i see your design binglei said hi friend you dislik an argument
and want to silenc thi
perhap i do argument ar too much like disput if you and miss
bennet will defer your till i am out of the room i shall be veri
thank and then you mai sai whatev you like of me
what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrific on my side and mr
darci had much better finish hi letter
mr darci took her advic and did finish hi letter
when that busi wa over he appli to miss binglei and elizabeth
for the indulg of some music miss binglei move with alacr to
the pianofort and after a polit request that elizabeth would lead the
wai which the other as polit and more earnestli negativ she
seat herself
mr hurst sang with her sister and while thei were thu emploi
elizabeth could not help observ as she turn over some musicbook
that lai on the instrument how frequent mr darci ey were fix
on her she hardli knew how to suppos that she could be an object of
admir to so great a man and yet that he should look at her becaus
he dislik her wa still more strang she could onli imagin howev
at last that she drew hi notic becaus there wa someth about her
more wrong and reprehens accord to hi idea of right than in
ani other person present the supposit did not pain her she like
him too littl to care for hi approb
after plai some italian song miss binglei vari the charm by a
live scotch air and soon afterward mr darci draw near
elizabeth said to her
do you not feel a great inclin miss bennet to seiz such an
opportun of danc a reel
she smile but made no answer he repeat the question with some
surpris at her silenc
oh said she i heard you befor but i could not immedi
determin what to sai in repli you want me i know to sai ye
that you might have the pleasur of despis my tast but i alwai
delight in overthrow those kind of scheme and cheat a person of
their premedit contempt i have therefor made up my mind to tell
you that i do not want to danc a reel at all and now despis me if you
dare
inde i do not dare
elizabeth have rather expect to affront him wa amaz at hi
gallantri but there wa a mixtur of sweet and arch in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybodi and darci had
never been so bewitch by ani woman as he wa by her he realli
believ that were it not for the inferior of her connect he
should be in some danger
miss binglei saw or suspect enough to be jealou and her great
anxieti for the recoveri of her dear friend jane receiv some
assist from her desir of get rid of elizabeth
she often tri to provok darci into dislik her guest by talk of
their suppos marriag and plan hi happi in such an allianc
i hope said she as thei were walk togeth in the shrubberi the
next dai you will give your motherinlaw a few hint when thi

toward him and said
by the bye charl ar you realli seriou in medit a danc at

the wish of the present parti i am much mistaken if there ar not
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punish than a

if you mean darci cri her brother he mai go to bed if he
choos befor it begin but as for the ball it is quit a settl
thing and as soon as nichol ha made white soup enough i shall send
round my card
i should like ball infinit better she repli if thei were
carri on in a differ manner but there is someth insuffer
tediou in the usual process of such a meet it would sure be much
more ration if convers instead of danc made the order of the

much more ration my dear carolin i dare sai but it would not be
near so much like a ball
miss binglei made no answer and soon afterward got up and walk about

himself and the agreeabl manner in which he immedi fell into
convers though it wa onli on it be a wet night and on the
probabl of a raini season made her feel that the commonest
dullest most threadbar topic might be render interest by the
skill of the speaker
with such rival for the notic of the fair as mr wickham and the
offic mr collin seem to sink into insignific to the young
ladi he certainli wa noth but he had still at interv a kind
listen in mr philip and wa by her watch most abundantli
suppli with coffe and muffin
when the card tabl were place he had an opportun of oblig her
in return by sit down to whist
i know littl of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to
improv myself for in my situat of life mr philip wa veri
thank for hi complianc but could not wait for hi reason
mr wickham did not plai at whist and with readi delight wa he
receiv at the other tabl between elizabeth and lydia at first there
seem danger of lydia engross him entir for she wa a most
determin talker but be likewis extrem fond of lotteri ticket
she soon grew too much interest in the game too eager in make bet
and exclaim after prize to have attent for anyon in particular
allow for the common demand of the game mr wickham wa therefor
at leisur to talk to elizabeth and she wa veri will to hear him
though what she chiefli wish to hear she could not hope to be told
the histori of hi acquaint with mr darci she dare not even
mention that gentleman her curios howev wa unexpectedli
reliev mr wickham began the subject himself he inquir how far
netherfield wa from meryton and after receiv her answer ask in
a hesit manner how long mr darci had been stai there
about a month said elizabeth and then unwil to let the subject
drop ad he is a man of veri larg properti in derbyshir i
understand
ye repli wickham hi estat there is a nobl on a clear ten
thousand per annum you could not have met with a person more capabl of
give you certain inform on that head than myselffor i have been
connect with hi famili in a particular manner from my infanc
elizabeth could not but look surpris
you mai well be surpris miss bennet at such an assert after
see as you probabl might the veri cold manner of our meet
yesterdai ar you much acquaint with mr darci
as much as i ever wish to be cri elizabeth warmli i have spent
four dai in the same hous with him and i think him veri
disagre
i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to hi be
agreeabl or otherwis i am not qualifi to form on i have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judg it is imposs for me to
be imparti but i believ your opinion of him would in gener
astonishand perhap you would not express it quit so strongli
anywher els here you ar in your own famili
upon my word i sai no more here than i might sai in ani hous in the
neighbourhood except netherfield he is not at all like in
hertfordshir everybodi is disgust with hi pride you will not find
him more favour spoken of by anyon
i cannot pretend to be sorri said wickham after a short
interrupt that he or that ani man should not be estim beyond
their desert but with him i believ it doe not often happen the
world is blind by hi fortun and consequ or frighten by hi
high and impos manner and see him onli as he choos to be seen
i should take him even on my slight acquaint to be an
illtemp man
wickham onli shook hi head
i wonder said he at the next opportun of speak whether he is
like to be in thi countri much longer
i do not at all know but i heard noth of hi go awai when i
wa at netherfield i hope your plan in favour of the shire will
not be affect by hi be in the neighbourhood
oh noit is not for me to be driven awai by mr darci if he
wish to avoid see me he must go we ar not on friendli term
and it alwai give me pain to meet him but i have no reason for
avoid him but what i might proclaim to all the worlda sens of
veri great illusag and most pain regret at hi be what he is
hi father miss bennet the late mr darci wa on of the best men
that ever breath and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be
in compani with thi mr darci without be griev to the soul by a
thousand tender recollect hi behaviour to myself ha been
scandal but i verili believ i could forgiv him anyth and
everyth rather than hi disappoint the hope and disgrac the
memori of hi father
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increas and listen with
all her heart but the delicaci of it prevent further inquiri
mr wickham began to speak on more gener topic meryton the
neighbourhood the societi appear highli pleas with all that he
had yet seen and speak of the latter especi with gentl but
veri intellig gallantri
it wa the prospect of constant societi and good societi he ad
which wa my chief induc to enter the shire i know it to be a
most respect agreeabl corp and my friend denni tempt me
further by hi account of their present quarter and the veri great
attent and excel acquaint meryton had procur them
societi i own is necessari to me i have been a disappoint man and
my spirit will not bear solitud i must have employ and societi
a militari life is not what i wa intend for but circumst have
now made it elig the church ought to have been my professioni
wa brought up for the church and i should at thi time have been in
possess of a most valuabl live had it pleas the gentleman we
were speak of just now
inde
yesth late mr darci bequeath me the next present of the best
live in hi gift he wa my godfath and excess attach to me
i cannot do justic to hi kind he meant to provid for me ampli
and thought he had done it but when the live fell it wa given
elsewher
good heaven cri elizabeth but how could that be how could hi
will be disregard why did not you seek legal redress
there wa just such an inform in the term of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubt the
intent but mr darci chose to doubt itor to treat it as a mere
condit recommend and to assert that i had forfeit all claim
to it by extravag imprud in short anyth or noth
certain it is that the live becam vacant two year ago exactli as i
wa of an ag to hold it and that it wa given to anoth man and no
less certain is it that i cannot accus myself of have realli done
anyth to deserv to lose it i have a warm unguard temper and i
mai perhap have sometim spoken my opinion of him and to him too
freeli i can recal noth wors but the fact is that we ar veri
differ sort of men and that he hate me
thi is quit shock he deserv to be publicli disgrac
some time or other he will bebut it shall not be by me till i
can forget hi father i can never defi or expos him
elizabeth honour him for such feel and thought him handsom than
ever as he express them
but what said she after a paus can have been hi motiv what can
have induc him to behav so cruelli
a thorough determin dislik of mea dislik which i cannot but
attribut in some measur to jealousi had the late mr darci like me
less hi son might have born with me better but hi father uncommon
attach to me irrit him i believ veri earli in life he had
not a temper to bear the sort of competit in which we stoodth sort
of prefer which wa often given me
i had not thought mr darci so bad as thisthough i have never like
him i had not thought so veri ill of himi had suppos him to be
despis hi fellowcreatur in gener but did not suspect him of
descend to such malici reveng such injustic such inhuman as
thi
after a few minut reflect howev she continu i do
rememb hi boast on dai at netherfield of the implac of
hi resent of hi have an unforgiv temper hi disposit
must be dread
i will not trust myself on the subject repli wickham i can
hardli be just to him
elizabeth wa again deep in thought and after a time exclaim to
treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourit of hi
father she could have ad a young man too like you whose veri
counten mai vouch for your be amiabl but she content herself
withand on too who had probabl been hi own companion from
childhood connect togeth as i think you said in the closest
manner
we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest
part of our youth wa pass togeth inmat of the same hous
share the same amus object of the same parent care my
father began life in the profess which your uncl mr philip
appear to do so much credit to but he gave up everyth to be of us
to the late mr darci and devot all hi time to the care of the
pemberlei properti he wa most highli esteem by mr darci a most
intim confidenti friend mr darci often acknowledg himself to
be under the greatest oblig to my father activ superintend
and when immedi befor my father death mr darci gave him a
voluntari promis of provid for me i am convinc that he felt it
to be as much a debt of gratitud to him as of affect to myself
how strang cri elizabeth how abomin i wonder that the veri
pride of thi mr darci ha not made him just to you if from no better
motiv that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestfor
dishonesti i must call it
it is wonder repli wickham for almost all hi action mai be
trace to pride and pride ha often been hi best friend it ha
connect him nearer with virtu than ani other feel but we ar none
of us consist and in hi behaviour to me there were stronger
impuls even than pride
can such abomin pride as hi have ever done him good
ye it ha often led him to be liber and gener to give hi monei
freeli to displai hospit to assist hi tenant and reliev the
poor famili pride and filial pride for he is veri proud of what hi
father wa have done thi not to appear to disgrac hi famili to
degener from the popular qualiti or lose the influenc of the
pemberlei hous is a power motiv he ha also brotherli pride
which with some brotherli affect make him a veri kind and
care guardian of hi sister and you will hear him gener cri up
as the most attent and best of brother
what sort of a girl is miss darci
he shook hi head i wish i could call her amiabl it give me pain to
speak ill of a darci but she is too much like her brotherveri veri
proud as a child she wa affection and pleas and extrem fond
of me and i have devot hour and hour to her amus but she is
noth to me now she is a handsom girl about fifteen or sixteen
and i understand highli accomplish sinc her father death her
home ha been london where a ladi live with her and superintend her
educ
after mani paus and mani trial of other subject elizabeth could not
help revert onc more to the first and sai
i am astonish at hi intimaci with mr binglei how can mr binglei
who seem goodhumour itself and is i realli believ truli amiabl
be in friendship with such a man how can thei suit each other do you
know mr binglei
not at all
he is a sweettemp amiabl charm man he cannot know what mr
darci is
probabl not but mr darci can pleas where he choos he doe not
want abil he can be a convers companion if he think it worth
hi while among those who ar at all hi equal in consequ he is a
veri differ man from what he is to the less prosper hi pride
never desert him but with the rich he is liberalmind just
sincer ration honour and perhap agreeableallow
someth for fortun and figur
the whist parti soon afterward break up the player gather round
the other tabl and mr collin took hi station between hi cousin
elizabeth and mr philip the usual inquiri as to hi success were
made by the latter it had not been veri great he had lost everi point
but when mr philip began to express her concern thereupon he assur
her with much earnest graviti that it wa not of the least import
that he consid the monei as a mere trifl and beg she would not
make herself uneasi
i know veri well madam said he that when person sit down to a
card tabl thei must take their chanc of these thingsand happili i
am not in such circumst as to make five shill ani object there
ar undoubtedli mani who could not sai the same but thank to ladi

a few moment he ask elizabeth in a low voic whether her relat
were veri intim acquaint with the famili of de bourgh
ladi catherin de bourgh she repli ha veri late given him a

notic but he certainli ha not known her long
you know of cours that ladi catherin de bourgh and ladi ann darci
were sister consequ that she is aunt to the present mr darci
no inde i did not i knew noth at all of ladi catherin
connect i never heard of her exist till the dai befor
yesterdai
her daughter miss de bourgh will have a veri larg fortun and it is
believ that she and her cousin will unit the two estat
thi inform made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss
binglei vain inde must be all her attent vain and useless her
affect for hi sister and her prais of himself if he were alreadi
selfdestin to anoth
mr collin said she speak highli both of ladi catherin and her
daughter but from some particular that he ha relat of her
ladyship i suspect hi gratitud mislead him and that in spite of
her be hi patro she is an arrog conceit woman
i believ her to be both in a great degre repli wickham i have
not seen her for mani year but i veri well rememb that i never like
her and that her manner were dictatori and insol she ha the
reput of be remark sensibl and clever but i rather believ
she deriv part of her abil from her rank and fortun part from
her authorit manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who
choos that everyon connect with him should have an understand of
the first class
elizabeth allow that he had given a veri ration account of it and
thei continu talk togeth with mutual satisfact till supper put
an end to card and gave the rest of the ladi their share of mr
wickham attent there could be no convers in the nois of
mr philipss supper parti but hi manner recommend him to
everybodi whatev he said wa said well and whatev he did done
gracefulli elizabeth went awai with her head full of him she could
think of noth but of mr wickham and of what he had told her all
the wai home but there wa not time for her even to mention hi name as
thei went for neither lydia nor mr collin were onc silent lydia
talk incessantli of lotteri ticket of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won and mr collin in describ the civil of mr and
mr philip protest that he did not in the least regard hi loss
at whist enumer all the dish at supper and repeatedli fear
that he crowd hi cousin had more to sai than he could well manag

elizabeth relat to jane the next dai what had pass between mr
wickham and herself jane listen with astonish and concern she
knew not how to believ that mr darci could be so unworthi of mr
binglei regard and yet it wa not in her natur to question the
verac of a young man of such amiabl appear as wickham the
possibl of hi have realli endur such unkind wa enough to
interest all her tender feel and noth therefor remain to be
done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and
throw into the account of accid or mistak whatev could not be
otherwis explain
thei have both said she been deceiv i dare sai in some wai or
other of which we can form no idea interest peopl have perhap
misrepres each to the other it is in short imposs for us to
conjectur the caus or circumst which mai have alien them
without actual blame on either side
veri true inde and now my dear jane what have you got to sai in
behalf of the interest peopl who have probabl been concern in the
busi do clear them too or we shall be oblig to think ill of
somebodi
laugh as much as you choos but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion my dearest lizzi do but consid in what a disgrac light
it place mr darci to be treat hi father favourit in such a
manneron whom hi father had promis to provid for it is
imposs no man of common human no man who had ani valu for hi
charact could be capabl of it can hi most intim friend be so
excess deceiv in him oh no
i can much more easili believ mr binglei be impos on than that
mr wickham should invent such a histori of himself as he gave me last
night name fact everyth mention without ceremoni if it be not
so let mr darci contradict it besid there wa truth in hi look
it is difficult indeedit is distress on doe not know what to
think
i beg your pardonon know exactli what to think
but jane could think with certainti on onli on pointthat mr
binglei if he had been impos on would have much to suffer when
the affair becam public
the two young ladi were summon from the shrubberi where thi
convers pass by the arriv of some of the veri person of whom
thei had been speak mr binglei and hi sister came to give their
person invit for the long expect ball at netherfield which wa
fix for the follow tuesdai the two ladi were delight to see
their dear friend again call it an ag sinc thei had met and
repeatedli ask what she had been do with herself sinc their
separ to the rest of the famili thei paid littl attent
avoid mr bennet as much as possibl sai not much to elizabeth
and noth at all to the other thei were soon gone again rise from
their seat with an activ which took their brother by surpris and
hurri off as if eager to escap from mr bennet civil
the prospect of the netherfield ball wa extrem agreeabl to everi
femal of the famili mr bennet chose to consid it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter and wa particularli flatter by
receiv the invit from mr binglei himself instead of a
ceremoni card jane pictur to herself a happi even in the
societi of her two friend and the attent of their brother and
elizabeth thought with pleasur of danc a great deal with mr
wickham and of see a confirm of everyth in mr darci look
and behaviour the happi anticip by catherin and lydia depend
less on ani singl event or ani particular person for though thei
each like elizabeth meant to danc half the even with mr wickham
he wa by no mean the onli partner who could satisfi them and a ball
wa at ani rate a ball and even mari could assur her famili that she
had no disinclin for it
while i can have my morn to myself said she it is enough i
think it is no sacrific to join occasion in even engag
societi ha claim on us all and i profess myself on of those who
consid interv of recreat and amus as desir for
everybodi
elizabeth spirit were so high on the occas that though she did
not often speak unnecessarili to mr collin she could not help ask
him whether he intend to accept mr binglei invit and if he
did whether he would think it proper to join in the even
amus and she wa rather surpris to find that he entertain no
scrupl whatev on that head and wa veri far from dread a rebuk
either from the archbishop or ladi catherin de bourgh by ventur to
danc
i am by no mean of opinion i assur you said he that a ball of
thi kind given by a young man of charact to respect peopl can
have ani evil tendenc and i am so far from object to danc
myself that i shall hope to be honour with the hand of all my fair
cousin in the cours of the even and i take thi opportun of
solicit your miss elizabeth for the two first danc especi a
prefer which i trust my cousin jane will attribut to the right
caus and not to ani disrespect for her
elizabeth felt herself complet taken in she had fulli propos be
engag by wickham for those veri danc and to have mr collin
insteadh liveli had been never wors time there wa no help
for it howev mr wickham happi and her own wa perforc
delai a littl longer and mr collinss propos accept with as
good a grace as she could she wa not the better pleas with hi
gallantri from the idea it suggest of someth more it now first
struck her that she wa select from among her sister as worthi of
be the mistress of hunsford parsonag and of assist to form a
quadril tabl at rose in the absenc of more elig visitor
the idea soon reach to convict as she observ hi increas
civil toward herself and heard hi frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivac and though more astonish than
gratifi herself by thi effect of her charm it wa not long befor
her mother gave her to understand that the probabl of their marriag
wa exceedingli agreeabl to her elizabeth howev did not choos
to take the hint be well awar that a seriou disput must be the
consequ of ani repli mr collin might never make the offer and
till he did it wa useless to quarrel about him
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepar for and talk of the
younger miss bennet would have been in a pitiabl state at thi time
for from the dai of the invit to the dai of the ball there wa
such a success of rain as prevent their walk to meryton onc no
aunt no offic no new could be sought after the veri shoeros
for netherfield were got by proxi even elizabeth might have found some
trial of her patienc in weather which total suspend the improv
of her acquaint with mr wickham and noth less than a danc on
tuesdai could have made such a fridai saturdai sundai and mondai

i do not imagin hi busi would have call him awai just now if
he had not wish to avoid a certain gentleman here
thi part of hi intellig though unheard by lydia wa caught by
elizabeth and as it assur her that darci wa not less answer for
wickham absenc than if her first surmis had been just everi feel
of displeasur against the former wa so sharpen by immedi

in darci breast there wa a toler power feel toward her
which soon procur her pardon and direct all hi anger against

thei had not long separ when miss binglei came toward her and
with an express of civil disdain thu accost her
so miss eliza i hear you ar quit delight with georg wickham
your sister ha been talk to me about him and ask me a thousand
question and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among hi
other commun that he wa the son of old wickham the late mr
darci steward let me recommend you howev as a friend not to give

him ill it is perfectli fals for on the contrari he ha been alwai
remark kind to him though georg wickham ha treat mr darci in a
most infam manner i do not know the particular but i know veri
well that mr darci is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear
to hear georg wickham mention and that though my brother thought he
could not well avoid includ him in hi invit to the offic he
wa excess glad to find that he had taken himself out of the wai
hi come into the countri at all is a most insol thing inde and
i wonder how he could presum to do it i piti you miss eliza for thi
discoveri of your favourit guilt but realli consid hi
descent on could not expect much better
hi guilt and hi descent appear by your account to be the same
said elizabeth angrili for i have heard you accus him of noth
wors than of be the son of mr darci steward and of that i can
assur you he inform me himself
i beg your pardon repli miss binglei turn awai with a sneer
excus my interfer it wa kindli meant
insol girl said elizabeth to herself you ar much mistaken if
you expect to influenc me by such a paltri attack as thi i see
noth in it but your own wil ignor and the malic of mr
darci she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make
inquiri on the same subject of binglei jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complac a glow of such happi express as suffici
mark how well she wa satisfi with the occurr of the even
elizabeth instantli read her feel and at that moment solicitud
for wickham resent against hi enemi and everyth els gave
wai befor the hope of jane be in the fairest wai for happi
i want to know said she with a counten no less smile than her
sister what you have learnt about mr wickham but perhap you have
been too pleasantli engag to think of ani third person in which case
you mai be sure of my pardon
no repli jane i have not forgotten him but i have noth
satisfactori to tell you mr binglei doe not know the whole of hi
histori and is quit ignor of the circumst which have
princip offend mr darci but he will vouch for the good conduct
the probiti and honour of hi friend and is perfectli convinc that
mr wickham ha deserv much less attent from mr darci than he ha
receiv and i am sorri to sai that by hi account as well as hi
sister mr wickham is by no mean a respect young man i am
afraid he ha been veri imprud and ha deserv to lose mr darci
regard
mr binglei doe not know mr wickham himself
no he never saw him till the other morn at meryton
thi account then is what he ha receiv from mr darci i am
perfectli satisfi but what doe he sai of the live
he doe not exactli recollect the circumst though he ha heard
them from mr darci more than onc but he believ that it wa left to
him condition onli
i have not a doubt of mr binglei sincer said elizabeth warmli
but you must excus my not be convinc by assur onli mr
binglei defenc of hi friend wa a veri abl on i dare sai but
sinc he is unacquaint with sever part of the stori and ha learnt
the rest from that friend himself i shall ventur still to think of
both gentlemen as i did befor
she then chang the discours to on more gratifi to each and on
which there could be no differ of sentiment elizabeth listen with
delight to the happi though modest hope which jane entertain of
binglei regard and said all in her power to heighten her confid
in it on their be join by mr binglei himself elizabeth withdrew
to miss luca to whose inquiri after the pleasant of her last
partner she had scarc repli befor mr collin came up to them
and told her with great exult that he had just been so fortun
as to make a most import discoveri
i have found out said he by a singular accid that there is now
in the room a near relat to my patro i happen to overhear the
gentleman himself mention to the young ladi who doe the honour of
thi hous the name of hi cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother
ladi catherin how wonderfulli these sort of thing occur who would
have thought of my meet withperhapsa nephew of ladi catherin de

in time for me to pai my respect to him which i am now go to do

ignor of the connect must plead my apolog
you ar not go to introduc yourself to mr darci

i believ him to be ladi catherin nephew it will be in my power to
assur him that her ladyship wa quit well yesterdai sennight
elizabeth tri hard to dissuad him from such a scheme assur him
that mr darci would consid hi address him without introduct as
an impertin freedom rather than a compliment to hi aunt that it
wa not in the least necessari there should be ani notic on either
side and that if it were it must belong to mr darci the superior in
consequ to begin the acquaint mr collin listen to her with
the determin air of follow hi own inclin and when she ceas
speak repli thu
my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your
excel judgment in all matter within the scope of your
understand but permit me to sai that there must be a wide differ
between the establish form of ceremoni amongst the laiti and those
which regul the clergi for give me leav to observ that i consid
the cleric offic as equal in point of digniti with the highest rank
in the kingdomprovid that a proper humil of behaviour is at the
same time maintain you must therefor allow me to follow the
dictat of my conscienc on thi occas which lead me to perform
what i look on as a point of duti pardon me for neglect to profit by
your advic which on everi other subject shall be my constant guid
though in the case befor us i consid myself more fit by educ
and habitu studi to decid on what is right than a young ladi like
yourself and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darci whose
recept of hi advanc she eagerli watch and whose astonish at
be so address wa veri evid her cousin prefac hi speech with
a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if
hear it all and saw in the motion of hi lip the word apolog
hunsford and ladi catherin de bourgh it vex her to see him
expos himself to such a man mr darci wa ey him with
unrestrain wonder and when at last mr collin allow him to speak
repli with an air of distant civil mr collin howev wa not
discourag from speak again and mr darci contempt seem
abundantli increas with the length of hi second speech and at the
end of it he onli made him a slight bow and move anoth wai mr
collin then return to elizabeth
i have no reason i assur you said he to be dissatisfi with my
recept mr darci seem much pleas with the attent he answer
me with the utmost civil and even paid me the compliment of sai
that he wa so well convinc of ladi catherin discern as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthili it wa realli a veri
handsom thought upon the whole i am much pleas with him
as elizabeth had no longer ani interest of her own to pursu she turn
her attent almost entir on her sister and mr binglei and the
train of agreeabl reflect which her observ gave birth to made
her perhap almost as happi as jane she saw her in idea settl in that
veri hous in all the felic which a marriag of true affect could
bestow and she felt capabl under such circumst of endeavour
even to like binglei two sister her mother thought she plainli
saw were bent the same wai and she determin not to ventur near her
lest she might hear too much when thei sat down to supper therefor
she consid it a most unlucki pervers which place them within
on of each other and deepli wa she vex to find that her mother wa
talk to that on person ladi luca freeli openli and of noth
els but of her expect that jane would be soon marri to mr
binglei it wa an anim subject and mr bennet seem incap
of fatigu while enumer the advantag of the match hi be such
a charm young man and so rich and live but three mile from them
were the first point of selfgratul and then it wa such a
comfort to think how fond the two sister were of jane and to be
certain that thei must desir the connect as much as she could do it
wa moreov such a promis thing for her younger daughter as
jane marri so greatli must throw them in the wai of other rich men
and lastli it wa so pleasant at her time of life to be abl to
consign her singl daughter to the care of their sister that she might
not be oblig to go into compani more than she like it wa necessari
to make thi circumst a matter of pleasur becaus on such
occas it is the etiquett but no on wa less like than mr
bennet to find comfort in stai at home at ani period of her life she
conclud with mani good wish that ladi luca might soon be equal
fortun though evid and triumphantli believ there wa no
chanc of it
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapid of her mother
word or persuad her to describ her felic in a less audibl
whisper for to her inexpress vexat she could perceiv that the
chief of it wa overheard by mr darci who sat opposit to them her
mother onli scold her for be nonsens
what is mr darci to me prai that i should be afraid of him i am
sure we ow him no such particular civil as to be oblig to sai
noth he mai not like to hear
for heaven sake madam speak lower what advantag can it be to you
to offend mr darci you will never recommend yourself to hi friend by
so do
noth that she could sai howev had ani influenc her mother would
talk of her view in the same intellig tone elizabeth blush and
blush again with shame and vexat she could not help frequent
glanc her ey at mr darci though everi glanc convinc her of what
she dread for though he wa not alwai look at her mother she wa
convinc that hi attent wa invari fix by her the express
of hi face chang gradual from indign contempt to a compos and
steadi graviti
at length howev mr bennet had no more to sai and ladi luca who
had been long yawn at the repetit of delight which she saw no
likelihood of share wa left to the comfort of cold ham and chicken
elizabeth now began to reviv but not long wa the interv of
tranquil for when supper wa over sing wa talk of and she
had the mortif of see mari after veri littl entreati
prepar to oblig the compani by mani signific look and silent
entreati did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisancebut in vain mari would not understand them such an
opportun of exhibit wa delight to her and she began her song
elizabeth ey were fix on her with most pain sensat and
she watch her progress through the sever stanza with an impati
which wa veri ill reward at their close for mari on receiv
amongst the thank of the tabl the hint of a hope that she might be
prevail on to favour them again after the paus of half a minut
began anoth mari power were by no mean fit for such a displai
her voic wa weak and her manner affect elizabeth wa in agoni
she look at jane to see how she bore it but jane wa veri composedli
talk to binglei she look at hi two sister and saw them make
sign of deris at each other and at darci who continu howev
impenetr grave she look at her father to entreat hi
interfer lest mari should be sing all night he took the hint
and when mari had finish her second song said aloud
that will do extrem well child you have delight us long enough
let the other young ladi have time to exhibit
mari though pretend not to hear wa somewhat disconcert and
elizabeth sorri for her and sorri for her father speech wa afraid
her anxieti had done no good other of the parti were now appli to
if i said mr collin were so fortun as to be abl to sing i
should have great pleasur i am sure in oblig the compani with an
air for i consid music as a veri innoc divers and perfectli
compat with the profess of a clergyman i do not mean howev
to assert that we can be justifi in devot too much of our time to
music for there ar certainli other thing to be attend to the
rector of a parish ha much to do in the first place he must make such
an agreement for tith as mai be benefici to himself and not
offens to hi patron he must write hi own sermon and the time
that remain will not be too much for hi parish duti and the care
and improv of hi dwell which he cannot be excus from make
as comfort as possibl and i do not think it of light import
that he should have attent and conciliatori manner toward
everybodi especi toward those to whom he ow hi prefer i
cannot acquit him of that duti nor could i think well of the man who
should omit an occas of testifi hi respect toward anybodi
connect with the famili and with a bow to mr darci he conclud
hi speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the
room mani staredmani smile but no on look more amus than mr
bennet himself while hi wife serious commend mr collin for
have spoken so sensibl and observ in a halfwhisp to ladi
luca that he wa a remark clever good kind of young man
to elizabeth it appear that had her famili made an agreement to
expos themselv as much as thei could dure the even it would
have been imposs for them to plai their part with more spirit or
finer success and happi did she think it for binglei and her sister

moment he set about it in a veri orderli manner with all the
observ which he suppos a regular part of the busi on find
mr bennet elizabeth and on of the younger girl togeth soon
after breakfast he address the mother in these word
mai i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth

upon elizabeth seem realli with vex and embarrass look about

elizabeth would not oppos such an injunct and a moment
consider make her also sensibl that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietli as possibl she sat down again and tri
to conceal by incess employ the feel which were divid
between distress and divers mr bennet and kitti walk off and as
soon as thei were gone mr collin began
believ me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesti so far from

would have been less amiabl in my ey had there not been thi littl
unwilling but allow me to assur you that i have your respect
mother permiss for thi address you can hardli doubt the purport
of my discours howev your natur delicaci mai lead you to
dissembl my attent have been too mark to be mistaken almost as
soon as i enter the hous i singl you out as the companion of my
futur life but befor i am run awai with by my feel on thi
subject perhap it will be advis for me to state my reason for
marryingand moreov for come into hertfordshir with the design
of select a wife as i certainli did
the idea of mr collin with all hi solemn composur be run awai
with by hi feel made elizabeth so near laugh that she could not
us the short paus he allow in ani attempt to stop him farther and
he continu
my reason for marri ar first that i think it a right thing for
everi clergyman in easi circumst like myself to set the exampl
of matrimoni in hi parish secondli that i am convinc it will add
veri greatli to my happi and thirdli which perhap i ought to
have mention earlier that it is the particular advic and
recommend of the veri nobl ladi whom i have the honour of call
patro twice ha she condescend to give me her opinion unask
too on thi subject and it wa but the veri saturdai night befor i
left hunsfordbetween our pool at quadril while mr jenkinson wa
arrang miss de bourgh footstoolthat she said mr collin you
must marri a clergyman like you must marri choos properli choos a
gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an activ
us sort of person not brought up high but abl to make a small
incom go a good wai thi is my advic find such a woman as soon as
you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by the
wai to observ my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notic and
kind of ladi catherin de bourgh as among the least of the
advantag in my power to offer you will find her manner beyond
anyth i can describ and your wit and vivac i think must be
accept to her especi when temper with the silenc and respect
which her rank will inevit excit thu much for my gener
intent in favour of matrimoni it remain to be told why my view
were direct to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i
assur you there ar mani amiabl young women but the fact is that
be as i am to inherit thi estat after the death of your honour
father who howev mai live mani year longer i could not satisfi
myself without resolv to choos a wife from among hi daughter that
the loss to them might be as littl as possibl when the melancholi
event take placewhich howev as i have alreadi said mai not be
for sever year thi ha been my motiv my fair cousin and i
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now noth
remain for me but to assur you in the most anim languag of the
violenc of my affect to fortun i am perfectli indiffer and
shall make no demand of that natur on your father sinc i am well
awar that it could not be compli with and that on thousand pound
in the 4 per cent which will not be your till after your mother
deceas is all that you mai ever be entitl to on that head
therefor i shall be uniformli silent and you mai assur yourself that
no ungener reproach shall ever pass my lip when we ar marri
it wa absolut necessari to interrupt him now
you ar too hasti sir she cri you forget that i have made no
answer let me do it without further loss of time accept my thank for
the compliment you ar pai me i am veri sensibl of the honour of
your propos but it is imposs for me to do otherwis than declin
them
i am not now to learn repli mr collin with a formal wave of the
hand that it is usual with young ladi to reject the address of the
man whom thei secretli mean to accept when he first appli for their
favour and that sometim the refus is repeat a second or even a
third time i am therefor by no mean discourag by what you have
just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar er long
upon my word sir cri elizabeth your hope is rather an
extraordinari on after my declar i do assur you that i am not
on of those young ladi if such young ladi there ar who ar so
dare as to risk their happi on the chanc of be ask a second
time i am perfectli seriou in my refus you could not make me
happi and i am convinc that i am the last woman in the world who
would make you so nai were your friend ladi catherin to know me i
am persuad she would find me in everi respect ill qualifi for the
situat
were it certain that ladi catherin would think so said mr collin
veri gravelybut i cannot imagin that her ladyship would at all
disapprov of you and you mai be certain that when i have the honour of
see her again i shall speak in the highest term of your modesti
economi and other amiabl qualif
inde mr collin all prais of me will be unnecessari you must
give me leav to judg for myself and pai me the compliment of
believ what i sai i wish you veri happi and veri rich and by
refus your hand do all in my power to prevent your be otherwis
in make me the offer you must have satisfi the delicaci of your
feel with regard to my famili and mai take possess of longbourn
estat whenev it fall without ani selfreproach thi matter mai be
consid therefor as final settl and rise as she thu
spoke she would have quit the room had not mr collin thu
address her
when i do myself the honour of speak to you next on the subject i
shall hope to receiv a more favour answer than you have now given
me though i am far from accus you of cruelti at present becaus i
know it to be the establish custom of your sex to reject a man on the
first applic and perhap you have even now said as much to
encourag my suit as would be consist with the true delicaci of the
femal charact
realli mr collin cri elizabeth with some warmth you puzzl me
exceedingli if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encourag i know not how to express my refus in such a wai as
mai convinc you of it be on
you must give me leav to flatter myself my dear cousin that your
refus of my address ar mere word of cours my reason for
believ it ar briefli theseit doe not appear to me that my hand
is unworthi your accept or that the establish i can offer would
be ani other than highli desir my situat in life my connect
with the famili of de bourgh and my relationship to your own ar
circumst highli in my favour and you should take it into further
consider that in spite of your manifold attract it is by no
mean certain that anoth offer of marriag mai ever be made you your
portion is unhappili so small that it will in all likelihood undo the
effect of your loveli and amiabl qualif as i must
therefor conclud that you ar not seriou in your reject of me i
shall choos to attribut it to your wish of increas my love by
suspens accord to the usual practic of eleg femal
i do assur you sir that i have no pretens whatev to that kind
of eleg which consist in torment a respect man i would
rather be paid the compliment of be believ sincer i thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your propos but
to accept them is absolut imposs my feel in everi respect
forbid it can i speak plainer do not consid me now as an eleg
femal intend to plagu you but as a ration creatur speak the
truth from her heart
you ar uniformli charm cri he with an air of awkward
gallantri and i am persuad that when sanction by the express
author of both your excel parent my propos will not fail of
be accept
to such persever in wil selfdecept elizabeth would make no
repli and immedi and in silenc withdrew determin that if he
persist in consid her repeat refus as flatter
encourag to appli to her father whose neg might be utter
in such a manner as must be decis and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affect and coquetri of an eleg femal

soon after their return a letter wa deliv to miss bennet it came
from netherfield and wa open immedi the envelop contain a
sheet of eleg littl hotpress paper well cover with a ladi
fair flow hand and elizabeth saw her sister counten chang as
she read it and saw her dwell intent on some particular passag
jane recollect herself soon and put the letter awai tri to
join with her usual cheer in the gener convers but
elizabeth felt an anxieti on the subject which drew off her attent
even from wickham and no sooner had he and hi companion taken leav
than a glanc from jane invit her to follow her upstair when thei
had gain their own room jane take out her letter said thi is
from carolin binglei what it contain ha surpris me a good deal
the whole parti have left netherfield by thi time and ar on their wai
to town and without ani intent of come back again you shall hear
what she sai
she then read the first sentenc aloud which compris the inform
of their have just resolv to follow their brother to town directli
and of their mean to dine that dai in grosvenor street where mr
hurst had a hous the next wa in these wordsi do not pretend to
regret anyth i shall leav in hertfordshir except your societi my
dearest friend but we will hope at some futur period to enjoi mani
return of that delight intercours we have known and in the
meanwhil mai lessen the pain of separ by a veri frequent and most
unreserv correspond i depend on you for that to these
highflown express elizabeth listen with all the insens of
distrust and though the sudden of their remov surpris her she
saw noth in it realli to lament it wa not to be suppos that their
absenc from netherfield would prevent mr binglei be there and as
to the loss of their societi she wa persuad that jane must soon
ceas to regard it in the enjoy of hi
it is unlucki said she after a short paus that you should not be
abl to see your friend befor thei leav the countri but mai we not
hope that the period of futur happi to which miss binglei look
forward mai arriv earlier than she is awar and that the delight
intercours you have known as friend will be renew with yet greater
satisfact as sister mr binglei will not be detain in london by
them
carolin decidedli sai that none of the parti will return into
hertfordshir thi winter i will read it to you
when my brother left us yesterdai he imagin that the busi which
took him to london might be conclud in three or four dai but as we
ar certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinc that when
charl get to town he will be in no hurri to leav it again we have
determin on follow him thither that he mai not be oblig to spend
hi vacant hour in a comfortless hotel mani of my acquaint ar
alreadi there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest
friend had ani intent of make on in the crowd but of that i
despair i sincer hope your christma in hertfordshir mai abound in
the gaieti which that season gener bring and that your beaux
will be so numer as to prevent your feel the loss of the three of
whom we shall depriv you
it is evid by thi ad jane that he come back no more thi
winter
it is onli evid that miss binglei doe not mean he should
why will you think so it must be hi own do he is hi own master
but you do not know all i will read you the passag which
particularli hurt me i will have no reserv from you mr darci is
impati to see hi sister and to confess the truth we ar scarc
less eager to meet her again i realli do not think georgiana darci ha
her equal for beauti eleg and accomplish and the affect
she inspir in louisa and myself is heighten into someth still
more interest from the hope we dare to entertain of her be
hereaft our sister i do not know whether i ever befor mention to
you my feel on thi subject but i will not leav the countri
without confid them and i trust you will not esteem them
unreason my brother admir her greatli alreadi he will have
frequent opportun now of see her on the most intim foot her
relat all wish the connect as much as hi own and a sister
partial is not mislead me i think when i call charl most
capabl of engag ani woman heart with all these circumst to
favour an attach and noth to prevent it am i wrong my dearest
jane in indulg the hope of an event which will secur the happi
of so mani what think you of thi sentenc my dear lizzi said
jane as she finish it is it not clear enough doe it not expressli
declar that carolin neither expect nor wish me to be her sister
that she is perfectli convinc of her brother indiffer and that
if she suspect the natur of my feel for him she mean most
kindli to put me on my guard can there be ani other opinion on the
subject
ye there can for mine is total differ will you hear it
most willingli
you shall have it in a few word miss binglei see that her brother is
in love with you and want him to marri miss darci she follow him to
town in the hope of keep him there and tri to persuad you that he
doe not care about you
jane shook her head
inde jane you ought to believ me no on who ha ever seen you
togeth can doubt hi affect miss binglei i am sure cannot she
is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr
darci for herself she would have order her wed cloth but the
case is thisw ar not rich enough or grand enough for them and she
is the more anxiou to get miss darci for her brother from the notion
that when there ha been on intermarriag she mai have less troubl
in achiev a second in which there is certainli some ingenu and i
dare sai it would succe if miss de bourgh were out of the wai but my
dearest jane you cannot serious imagin that becaus miss binglei
tell you her brother greatli admir miss darci he is in the smallest
degre less sensibl of your merit than when he took leav of you on
tuesdai or that it will be in her power to persuad him that instead
of be in love with you he is veri much in love with her friend
if we thought alik of miss binglei repli jane your
represent of all thi might make me quit easi but i know the
foundat is unjust carolin is incap of wilfulli deceiv
anyon and all that i can hope in thi case is that she is deceiv
herself
that is right you could not have start a more happi idea sinc you
will not take comfort in mine believ her to be deceiv by all mean
you have now done your duti by her and must fret no longer
but my dear sister can i be happi even suppos the best in
accept a man whose sister and friend ar all wish him to marri
elsewher
you must decid for yourself said elizabeth and if upon matur
deliber you find that the miseri of disoblig hi two sister is
more than equival to the happi of be hi wife i advis you
by all mean to refus him
how can you talk so said jane faintli smile you must know that
though i should be exceedingli griev at their disapprob i could
not hesit
i did not think you would and that be the case i cannot consid
your situat with much compass
but if he return no more thi winter my choic will never be
requir a thousand thing mai aris in six month
the idea of hi return no more elizabeth treat with the utmost
contempt it appear to her mere the suggest of carolin
interest wish and she could not for a moment suppos that those
wish howev openli or artfulli spoken could influenc a young man
so total independ of everyon
she repres to her sister as forcibl as possibl what she felt on
the subject and had soon the pleasur of see it happi effect
jane temper wa not despond and she wa gradual led to hope
though the diffid of affect sometim overcam the hope that
binglei would return to netherfield and answer everi wish of her heart
thei agre that mr bennet should onli hear of the departur of the
famili without be alarm on the score of the gentleman conduct
but even thi partial commun gave her a great deal of concern
and she bewail it as exceedingli unlucki that the ladi should happen
to go awai just as thei were all get so intim togeth after
lament it howev at some length she had the consol of
think that mr binglei would be soon down again and soon dine at

elizabeth wa sit with her mother and sister reflect on what
she had heard and doubt whether she wa author to mention it
when sir william luca himself appear sent by hi daughter to
announc her engag to the famili with mani compliment to them
and much selfgratul on the prospect of a connect between the
hous he unfold the matterto an audienc not mere wonder
but incredul for mr bennet with more persever than
polit protest he must be entir mistaken and lydia alwai
unguard and often uncivil boister exclaim
good lord sir william how can you tell such a stori do not you know
that mr collin want to marri lizzi
noth less than the complais of a courtier could have born
without anger such treatment but sir william goodbreed carri
him through it all and though he beg leav to be posit as to the
truth of hi inform he listen to all their impertin with the
most forbear courtesi
elizabeth feel it incumb on her to reliev him from so unpleas
a situat now put herself forward to confirm hi account by
mention her prior knowledg of it from charlott herself and
endeavour to put a stop to the exclam of her mother and sister
by the earnest of her congratul to sir william in which she
wa readili join by jane and by make a varieti of remark on the
happi that might be expect from the match the excel charact
of mr collin and the conveni distanc of hunsford from london
mr bennet wa in fact too much overpow to sai a great deal while
sir william remain but no sooner had he left them than her feel
found a rapid vent in the first place she persist in disbeliev
the whole of the matter secondli she wa veri sure that mr collin
had been taken in thirdli she trust that thei would never be happi
togeth and fourthli that the match might be broken off two
infer howev were plainli deduc from the whole on that
elizabeth wa the real caus of all the mischief and the other that
she herself had been barbar us by them all and on these two
point she princip dwelt dure the rest of the dai noth could
consol and noth appeas her nor did that dai wear out her
resent a week elaps befor she could see elizabeth without
scold her a month pass awai befor she could speak to sir william
or ladi luca without be rude and mani month were gone befor she
could at all forgiv their daughter
mr bennet emot were much more tranquil on the occas and such
as he did experi he pronounc to be of a most agreeabl sort for
it gratifi him he said to discov that charlott luca whom he had
been us to think toler sensibl wa as foolish as hi wife and
more foolish than hi daughter
jane confess herself a littl surpris at the match but she said
less of her astonish than of her earnest desir for their happi
nor could elizabeth persuad her to consid it as improb kitti and
lydia were far from envi miss luca for mr collin wa onli a
clergyman and it affect them in no other wai than as a piec of new
to spread at meryton
ladi luca could not be insens of triumph on be abl to retort on
mr bennet the comfort of have a daughter well marri and she
call at longbourn rather often than usual to sai how happi she wa
though mr bennet sour look and illnatur remark might have been
enough to drive happi awai
between elizabeth and charlott there wa a restraint which kept them
mutual silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuad that no
real confid could ever subsist between them again her
disappoint in charlott made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister of whose rectitud and delicaci she wa sure her opinion could
never be shaken and for whose happi she grew daili more anxiou as
binglei had now been gone a week and noth wa heard of hi return
jane had sent carolin an earli answer to her letter and wa count
the dai till she might reason hope to hear again the promis
letter of thank from mr collin arriv on tuesdai address to their

twelvemonth abod in the famili might have prompt after
discharg hi conscienc on that head he proceed to inform them
with mani raptur express of hi happi in have obtain the
affect of their amiabl neighbour miss luca and then explain
that it wa mere with the view of enjoi her societi that he had
been so readi to close with their kind wish of see him again at
longbourn whither he hope to be abl to return on mondai fortnight
for ladi catherin he ad so heartili approv hi marriag that
she wish it to take place as soon as possibl which he trust would
be an unanswer argument with hi amiabl charlott to name an earli
dai for make him the happiest of men
mr collinss return into hertfordshir wa no longer a matter of
pleasur to mr bennet on the contrari she wa as much dispos to
complain of it as her husband it wa veri strang that he should come
to longbourn instead of to luca lodg it wa also veri inconveni
and exceedingli troublesom she hate have visitor in the hous
while her health wa so indiffer and lover were of all peopl the
most disagre such were the gentl murmur of mr bennet and thei
gave wai onli to the greater distress of mr binglei continu
absenc
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfort on thi subject dai after
dai pass awai without bring ani other tide of him than the
report which shortli prevail in meryton of hi come no more to
netherfield the whole winter a report which highli incens mr
bennet and which she never fail to contradict as a most scandal
falsehood
even elizabeth began to fearnot that binglei wa indifferentbut that
hi sister would be success in keep him awai unwil as she
wa to admit an idea so destruct to jane happi and so
dishonour to the stabil of her lover she could not prevent it
frequent recur the unit effort of hi two unfeel sister
and of hi overpow friend assist by the attract of miss
darci and the amus of london might be too much she fear for
the strength of hi attach
as for jane her anxieti under thi suspens wa of cours more
pain than elizabeth but whatev she felt she wa desir of
conceal and between herself and elizabeth therefor the subject
wa never allud to but as no such delicaci restrain her mother an
hour seldom pass in which she did not talk of binglei express her
impati for hi arriv or even requir jane to confess that if he

mr collin return most punctual on the mondai fortnight but hi

i am far from attribut ani part of mr binglei conduct to design
said elizabeth but without scheme to do wrong or to make other
unhappi there mai be error and there mai be miseri thoughtless
want of attent to other peopl feel and want of resolut

you persist then in suppos hi sister influenc him
ye in conjunct with hi friend
i cannot believ it why should thei try to influenc him thei can
onli wish hi happi and if he is attach to me no other woman can
secur it
your first posit is fals thei mai wish mani thing besid hi
happi thei mai wish hi increas of wealth and consequ thei
mai wish him to marri a girl who ha all the import of monei great
connect and pride
beyond a doubt thei do wish him to choos miss darci repli jane

thei should have oppos their brother what sister would think

with less perplex her daughter endeavour to convinc her of what
she did not believ herself that hi attent to jane had been mere

over it immedi it had better have happen to you lizzi you
would have laugh yourself out of it sooner but do you think she would
be prevail on to go back with us chang of scene might be of
serviceand perhap a littl relief from home mai be as us as
anyth
elizabeth wa exceedingli pleas with thi propos and felt persuad
of her sister readi acquiesc
i hope ad mr gardin that no consider with regard to
thi young man will influenc her we live in so differ a part of
town all our connect ar so differ and as you well know we go
out so littl that it is veri improb thei should meet at all
unless he realli come to see her
and that is quit imposs for he is now in the custodi of hi
friend and mr darci would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a
part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr darci mai
perhap have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he
would hardli think a month ablut enough to cleans him from it
impur were he onc to enter it and depend upon it mr binglei
never stir without him
so much the better i hope thei will not meet at all but doe not jane
correspond with hi sister she will not be abl to help call
she will drop the acquaint entir
but in spite of the certainti in which elizabeth affect to place thi
point as well as the still more interest on of binglei be
withheld from see jane she felt a solicitud on the subject which
convinc her on examin that she did not consid it entir
hopeless it wa possibl and sometim she thought it probabl that
hi affect might be reanim and the influenc of hi friend
successfulli combat by the more natur influenc of jane
attract
miss bennet accept her aunt invit with pleasur and the
binglei were no otherwis in her thought at the same time than as she
hope by carolin not live in the same hous with her brother she
might occasion spend a morn with her without ani danger of
see him
the gardin stai a week at longbourn and what with the philips
the lucas and the offic there wa not a dai without it

of her brother and sister that thei did not onc sit down to a famili
dinner when the engag wa for home some of the offic alwai
made part of it of which offic mr wickham wa sure to be on and
on these occas mr gardin render suspici by elizabeth
warm commend of him narrowli observ them both without suppos
them from what she saw to be veri serious in love their prefer
of each other wa plain enough to make her a littl uneasi and she
resolv to speak to elizabeth on the subject befor she left
hertfordshir and repres to her the imprud of encourag such
an attach
to mr gardin wickham had on mean of afford pleasur
unconnect with hi gener power about ten or a dozen year ago
befor her marriag she had spent a consider time in that veri part

when she rose to take leav elizabeth asham of her mother
ungraci and reluct good wish and sincer affect herself
accompani her out of the room as thei went down stair togeth
charlott said
i shall depend on hear from you veri often eliza

we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshir
i am not like to leav kent for some time promis me therefor to

my father and maria ar to come to me in march ad charlott and
i hope you will consent to be of the parti inde eliza you will be
as welcom to me as either of them
the wed took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from
the church door and everybodi had as much to sai or to hear on the
subject as usual elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their
correspond wa as regular and frequent as it ever had been that it
should be equal unreserv wa imposs elizabeth could never
address her without feel that all the comfort of intimaci wa over
and though determin not to slacken as a correspond it wa for the
sake of what had been rather than what wa charlott first letter
were receiv with a good deal of eager there could not but be
curios to know how she would speak of her new home how she would
like ladi catherin and how happi she would dare pronounc herself to
be though when the letter were read elizabeth felt that charlott
express herself on everi point exactli as she might have foreseen she
wrote cheerfulli seem surround with comfort and mention noth
which she could not prais the hous furnitur neighbourhood and
road were all to her tast and ladi catherin behaviour wa most
friendli and oblig it wa mr collinss pictur of hunsford and
rose ration soften and elizabeth perceiv that she must wait
for her own visit there to know the rest
jane had alreadi written a few line to her sister to announc their
safe arriv in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hope it
would be in her power to sai someth of the binglei
her impati for thi second letter wa as well reward as impati
gener is jane had been a week in town without either see or
hear from carolin she account for it howev by suppos that
her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accid been
lost
my aunt she continu is go tomorrow into that part of the
town and i shall take the opportun of call in grosvenor street
she wrote again when the visit wa paid and she had seen miss binglei
i did not think carolin in spirit were her word but she wa veri
glad to see me and reproach me for give her no notic of my come
to london i wa right therefor my last letter had never reach her
i inquir after their brother of cours he wa well but so much
engag with mr darci that thei scarc ever saw him i found that
miss darci wa expect to dinner i wish i could see her my visit wa
not long as carolin and mr hurst were go out i dare sai i shall
soon see them here
elizabeth shook her head over thi letter it convinc her that
accid onli could discov to mr binglei her sister be in town
four week pass awai and jane saw noth of him she endeavour to
persuad herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be
blind to miss binglei inattent after wait at home everi morn
for a fortnight and invent everi even a fresh excus for her the
visitor did at last appear but the short of her stai and yet
more the alter of her manner would allow jane to deceiv herself
no longer the letter which she wrote on thi occas to her sister
will prove what she felt
my dearest lizzi will i am sure be incap of triumph in
her better judgment at my expens when i confess myself to have
been entir deceiv in miss binglei regard for me but my
dear sister though the event ha prove you right do not think me
obstin if i still assert that consid what her behaviour
wa my confid wa as natur as your suspicion i do not at
all comprehend her reason for wish to be intim with me but
if the same circumst were to happen again i am sure i should
be deceiv again carolin did not return my visit till yesterdai
and not a note not a line did i receiv in the meantim when she
did come it wa veri evid that she had no pleasur in it she
made a slight formal apolog for not call befor said not a
word of wish to see me again and wa in everi respect so
alter a creatur that when she went awai i wa perfectli
resolv to continu the acquaint no longer i piti though i
cannot help blame her she wa veri wrong in singl me out as
she did i can safe sai that everi advanc to intimaci began on
her side but i piti her becaus she must feel that she ha been
act wrong and becaus i am veri sure that anxieti for her
brother is the caus of it i need not explain myself farther and
though we know thi anxieti to be quit needless yet if she
feel it it will easili account for her behaviour to me and so
deservedli dear as he is to hi sister whatev anxieti she mai
feel on hi behalf is natur and amiabl i cannot but wonder
howev at her have ani such fear now becaus if he had at all
care about me we must have met long long ago he know of my
be in town i am certain from someth she said herself and
yet it would seem by her manner of talk as if she want to
persuad herself that he is realli partial to miss darci i cannot
understand it if i were not afraid of judg harshli i should be
almost tempt to sai that there is a strong appear of
duplic in all thi i will endeavour to banish everi pain
thought and think onli of what will make me happi your affect
and the invari kind of my dear uncl and aunt let me hear
from you veri soon miss binglei said someth of hi never
return to netherfield again of give up the hous but not
with ani certainti we had better not mention it i am extrem
glad that you have such pleasant account from our friend at
hunsford prai go to see them with sir william and maria i am

thi letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirit return as she

review of it and as a punish for him as well as a possibl
advantag to jane she serious hope he might realli soon marri mr
darci sister as by wickham account she would make him abundantli
regret what he had thrown awai
mr gardin about thi time remind elizabeth of her promis
concern that gentleman and requir inform and elizabeth had
such to send as might rather give content to her aunt than to
herself hi appar partial had subsid hi attent were over

noth on the contrari could be more natur and while abl to

elizabeth courag did not fail her she had heard noth of ladi

the servant through an antechamb to the room where ladi catherin
her daughter and mr jenkinson were sit her ladyship with great
condescens aros to receiv them and as mr collin had settl it

in spite of have been at st jamess sir william wa so complet
aw by the grandeur surround him that he had but just courag
enough to make a veri low bow and take hi seat without sai a word
and hi daughter frighten almost out of her sens sat on the edg
of her chair not know which wai to look elizabeth found herself
quit equal to the scene and could observ the three ladi befor her
composedli ladi catherin wa a tall larg woman with stronglymark

and the gentlemen did noth but eat and admir
when the ladi return to the drawingroom there wa littl to be

elizabeth wa sit by herself the next morn and write to jane

when she wa startl by a ring at the door the certain signal of a
visitor as she had heard no carriag she thought it not unlik to be
ladi catherin and under that apprehens wa put awai her
halffinish letter that she might escap all impertin question
when the door open and to her veri great surpris mr darci and mr
darci onli enter the room
he seem astonish too on find her alon and apolog for hi
intrus by let her know that he had understood all the ladi to
be within
thei then sat down and when her inquiri after rose were made
seem in danger of sink into total silenc it wa absolut
necessari therefor to think of someth and in thi emerg
recollect when she had seen him last in hertfordshir and feel
curiou to know what he would sai on the subject of their hasti
departur she observ
how veri suddenli you all quit netherfield last novemb mr darci
it must have been a most agreeabl surpris to mr binglei to see you
all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the dai
befor he and hi sister were well i hope when you left london
perfectli so i thank you
she found that she wa to receiv no other answer and after a short
paus ad
i think i have understood that mr binglei ha not much idea of ever
return to netherfield again
i have never heard him sai so but it is probabl that he mai spend
veri littl of hi time there in futur he ha mani friend and he is
at a time of life when friend and engag ar continu
increas
if he mean to be but littl at netherfield it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entir for then we
might possibl get a settl famili there but perhap mr binglei did
not take the hous so much for the conveni of the neighbourhood as
for hi own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
principl
i should not be surpris said darci if he were to give it up as
soon as ani elig purchas offer
elizabeth made no answer she wa afraid of talk longer of hi
friend and have noth els to sai wa now determin to leav the
troubl of find a subject to him
he took the hint and soon began with thi seem a veri comfort
hous ladi catherin i believ did a great deal to it when mr
collin first came to hunsford
i believ she didand i am sure she could not have bestow her
kind on a more grate object
mr collin appear veri fortun in hi choic of a wife
ye inde hi friend mai well rejoic in hi have met with on of
the veri few sensibl women who would have accept him or have made
him happi if thei had my friend ha an excel understandingthough
i am not certain that i consid her marri mr collin as the wisest
thing she ever did she seem perfectli happi howev and in a
prudenti light it is certainli a veri good match for her
it must be veri agreeabl to her to be settl within so easi a
distanc of her own famili and friend
an easi distanc do you call it it is nearli fifti mile
and what is fifti mile of good road littl more than half a dai
journei ye i call it a veri easi distanc
i should never have consid the distanc as on of the advantag
of the match cri elizabeth i should never have said mr collin
wa settl near her famili
it is a proof of your own attach to hertfordshir anyth beyond
the veri neighbourhood of longbourn i suppos would appear far
as he spoke there wa a sort of smile which elizabeth fanci she
understood he must be suppos her to be think of jane and
netherfield and she blush as she answer
i do not mean to sai that a woman mai not be settl too near her
famili the far and the near must be rel and depend on mani
vari circumst where there is fortun to make the expens of
travel unimport distanc becom no evil but that is not the
case here mr and mr collin have a comfort incom but not
such a on as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuad my
friend would not call herself near her famili under less than half
the present distanc
mr darci drew hi chair a littl toward her and said you cannot
have a right to such veri strong local attach you cannot have
been alwai at longbourn
elizabeth look surpris the gentleman experienc some chang of

what can be the mean of thi said charlott as soon as he wa
gone my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never
have call on us in thi familiar wai
but when elizabeth told of hi silenc it did not seem veri like
even to charlott wish to be the case and after variou
conjectur thei could at last onli suppos hi visit to proce from
the difficulti of find anyth to do which wa the more probabl
from the time of year all field sport were over within door there
wa ladi catherin book and a billiard tabl but gentlemen cannot be

pleasant of the walk to it or of the peopl who live in it the

him still more and elizabeth wa remind by her own satisfact in

favourit georg wickham and though in compar them she saw there
wa less captiv soft in colonel fitzwilliam manner she
believ he might have the best inform mind
but why mr darci came so often to the parsonag it wa more difficult
to understand it could not be for societi as he frequent sat there
ten minut togeth without open hi lip and when he did speak it
seem the effect of necess rather than of choicea sacrific to
proprieti not a pleasur to himself he seldom appear realli
anim mr collin knew not what to make of him colonel
fitzwilliam occasion laugh at hi stupid prove that he wa
gener differ which her own knowledg of him could not have told

love and the object of that love her friend eliza she set herself

certainli look at her friend a great deal but the express of that
look wa disput it wa an earnest steadfast gaze but she often
doubt whether there were much admir in it and sometim it
seem noth but absenc of mind
she had onc or twice suggest to elizabeth the possibl of hi
be partial to her but elizabeth alwai laugh at the idea and mr
collin did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of
rais expect which might onli end in disappoint for in her
opinion it admit not of a doubt that all her friend dislik would
vanish if she could suppos him to be in her power
in her kind scheme for elizabeth she sometim plan her marri
colonel fitzwilliam he wa beyond comparison the pleasantest man he

more than onc did elizabeth in her rambl within the park
unexpectedli meet mr darci she felt all the pervers of the
mischanc that should bring him where no on els wa brought and to
prevent it ever happen again took care to inform him at first
that it wa a favourit haunt of her how it could occur a second time
therefor wa veri odd yet it did and even the third it seem like
wil illnatur or a voluntari penanc for on these occas it wa
not mere a few formal inquiri and an awkward paus and then awai
but he actual thought it necessari to turn back and walk with her he
never said a great deal nor did she give herself the troubl of talk
or of listen much but it struck her in the cours of their third
rencount that he wa ask some odd unconnect questionsabout her
pleasur in be at hunsford her love of solitari walk and her
opinion of mr and mr collinss happi and that in speak of
rose and her not perfectli understand the hous he seem to
expect that whenev she came into kent again she would be stai
there too hi word seem to impli it could he have colonel
fitzwilliam in hi thought she suppos if he meant anyth he must
mean an allus to what might aris in that quarter it distress her
a littl and she wa quit glad to find herself at the gate in the
pale opposit the parsonag
she wa engag on dai as she walk in reperus jane last
letter and dwell on some passag which prove that jane had not
written in spirit when instead of be again surpris by mr darci
she saw on look up that colonel fitzwilliam wa meet her
put awai the letter immedi and forc a smile she said
i did not know befor that you ever walk thi wai
i have been make the tour of the park he repli as i gener
do everi year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonag
ar you go much farther
no i should have turn in a moment
and accordingli she did turn and thei walk toward the parsonag
togeth
do you certainli leav kent on saturdai said she
yesif darci doe not put it off again but i am at hi dispos he
arrang the busi just as he pleas
and if not abl to pleas himself in the arrang he ha at least
great pleasur in the power of choic i do not know anybodi who seem
more to enjoi the power of do what he like than mr darci
he like to have hi own wai veri well repli colonel fitzwilliam
but so we all do it is onli that he ha better mean of have it than
mani other becaus he is rich and mani other ar poor i speak
feelingli a younger son you know must be inur to selfdeni and
depend
in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know veri littl of
either now serious what have you ever known of selfdeni and
depend when have you been prevent by want of monei from go
wherev you chose or procur anyth you had a fanci for
these ar home questionsand perhap i cannot sai that i have
experienc mani hardship of that natur but in matter of greater
weight i mai suffer from the want of monei younger son cannot marri
where thei like
unless where thei like women of fortun which i think thei veri often
do
our habit of expens make us too depend and there ar not mani in
my rank of life who can afford to marri without some attent to
monei
is thi thought elizabeth meant for me and she colour at the
idea but recov herself said in a live tone and prai what is
the usual price of an earl younger son unless the elder brother is
veri sickli i suppos you would not ask abov fifti thousand pound
he answer her in the same style and the subject drop to interrupt
a silenc which might make him fanci her affect with what had pass
she soon afterward said
i imagin your cousin brought you down with him chiefli for the sake of
have somebodi at hi dispos i wonder he doe not marri to secur a
last conveni of that kind but perhap hi sister doe as well
for the present and as she is under hi sole care he mai do what he
like with her
no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantag which he must
divid with me i am join with him in the guardianship of miss darci
ar you inde and prai what sort of a guardian do you make doe
your charg give you much troubl young ladi of her ag ar sometim
a littl difficult to manag and if she ha the true darci spirit she
mai like to have her own wai
as she spoke she observ him look at her earnestli and the manner
in which he immedi ask her why she suppos miss darci like to
give them ani uneasi convinc her that she had somehow or other
got pretti near the truth she directli repli
you need not be frighten i never heard ani harm of her and i dare
sai she is on of the most tractabl creatur in the world she is a
veri great favourit with some ladi of my acquaint mr hurst and
miss binglei i think i have heard you sai that you know them
i know them a littl their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlik
manh is a great friend of darci
oh ye said elizabeth drilymr darci is uncommonli kind to mr
binglei and take a prodigi deal of care of him
care of him ye i realli believ darci doe take care of him in
those point where he most want care from someth that he told me
in our journei hither i have reason to think binglei veri much indebt
to him but i ought to beg hi pardon for i have no right to suppos
that binglei wa the person meant it wa all conjectur
what is it you mean
it is a circumst which darci of cours could not wish to be
gener known becaus if it were to get round to the ladi famili it
would be an unpleas thing
you mai depend upon my not mention it
and rememb that i have not much reason for suppos it to be
binglei what he told me wa mere thi that he congratul himself
on have late save a friend from the inconveni of a most
imprud marriag but without mention name or ani other
particular and i onli suspect it to be binglei from believ him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from
know them to have been togeth the whole of last summer
did mr darci give you hi reason for thi interfer
i understood that there were some veri strong object against the
ladi
and what art did he us to separ them
he did not talk to me of hi own art said fitzwilliam smile he
onli told me what i have now told you
elizabeth made no answer and walk on her heart swell with
indign after watch her a littl fitzwilliam ask her why she
wa so thought
i am think of what you have been tell me said she your
cousin conduct doe not suit my feel why wa he to be the
judg
you ar rather dispos to call hi interfer offici
i do not see what right mr darci had to decid on the proprieti of hi
friend inclin or why upon hi own judgment alon he wa to
determin and direct in what manner that friend wa to be happi but
she continu recollect herself as we know none of the
particular it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be suppos
that there wa much affect in the case
that is not an unnatur surmis said fitzwilliam but it is
lessen the honour of my cousin triumph veri sadli
thi wa spoken jestingli but it appear to her so just a pictur of
mr darci that she would not trust herself with an answer and
therefor abruptli chang the convers talk on indiffer
matter till thei reach the parsonag there shut into her own room
as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interrupt
of all that she had heard it wa not to be suppos that ani other
peopl could be meant than those with whom she wa connect there
could not exist in the world two men over whom mr darci could have
such boundless influenc that he had been concern in the measur
taken to separ mr binglei and jane she had never doubt but she
had alwai attribut to miss binglei the princip design and
arrang of them if hi own vaniti howev did not mislead him
he wa the causehi pride and capric were the causeof all that
jane had suffer and still continu to suffer he had ruin for a
while everi hope of happi for the most affection gener heart
in the world and no on could sai how last an evil he might have
inflict
there were some veri strong object against the ladi were colonel
fitzwilliam word and these strong object probabl were her
have on uncl who wa a countri attornei and anoth who wa in
busi in london
to jane herself she exclaim there could be no possibl of
objectional loveli and good as she is her understand
excel her mind improv and her manner captiv neither could
anyth be urg against my father who though with some
peculiar ha abil which mr darci himself need not disdain
and respect which he will probabl never reach when she thought
of her mother inde her confid gave wai a littl but she would
not allow that ani object there had materi weight with mr
darci whose pride she wa convinc would receiv a deeper wound from
the want of import in hi friend connect than from their want
of sens and she wa quit decid at last that he had been partli
govern by thi worst kind of pride and partli by the wish of
retain mr binglei for hi sister
the agit and tear which the subject occas brought on a
headach and it grew so much wors toward the even that ad to
her unwilling to see mr darci it determin her not to attend her
cousin to rose where thei were engag to drink tea mr collin
see that she wa realli unwel did not press her to go and as much
as possibl prevent her husband from press her but mr collin
could not conceal hi apprehens of ladi catherin be rather

examin of all the letter which jane had written to her sinc her

reviv of past occurr or ani commun of present suffer

proceed from the seren of a mind at eas with itself and kindli

notic everi sentenc convei the idea of uneasi with an

shame boast of what miseri he had been abl to inflict gave her a
keener sens of her sister suffer it wa some consol to
think that hi visit to rose wa to end on the dai after the next
and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be
with jane again and enabl to contribut to the recoveri of her
spirit by all that affect could do
she could not think of darci leav kent without rememb that hi
cousin wa to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intent at all and agreeabl as he wa she did not

while settl thi point she wa suddenli rous by the sound of the

then get up walk about the room elizabeth wa surpris but
said not a word after a silenc of sever minut he came toward her
in an agit manner and thu began

in spite of her deeplyroot dislik she could not be insens to

counten express real secur such a circumst could onli
exasper farther and when he ceas the colour rose into her cheek
and she said
in such case as thi it is i believ the establish mode to

mr darci who wa lean against the mantelpiec with hi ey fix
on her face seem to catch her word with no less resent than
surpris hi complexion becam pale with anger and the disturb of
hi mind wa visibl in everi featur he wa struggl for the

himself to have attain it the paus wa to elizabeth feel
dread at length in a voic of forc calm he said
and thi is all the repli which i am to have the honour of expect i
might perhap wish to be inform why with so littl endeavour at
civil i am thu reject but it is of small import
i might as well inquir repli she why with so evid a design
of offend and insult me you chose to tell me that you like me
against your will against your reason and even against your charact
wa not thi some excus for incivil if i wa uncivil but i have
other provoc you know i have had not my own feel decid
against you had thei been indiffer or had thei even been

the man who ha been the mean of ruin perhap for ever the

as she pronounc these word mr darci chang colour but the emot
wa short and he listen without attempt to interrupt her while she
continu
i have everi reason in the world to think ill of you no motiv can
excus the unjust and ungener part you act there you dare not
you cannot deni that you have been the princip if not the onli mean
of divid them from each other of expos on to the censur of the

she paus and saw with no slight indign that he wa listen
with an air which prove him wholli unmov by ani feel of remors
he even look at her with a smile of affect incredul
can you deni that you have done it she repeat
with assum tranquil he then repli i have no wish of deni
that i did everyth in my power to separ my friend from your
sister or that i rejoic in my success toward him i have been
kinder than toward myself
elizabeth disdain the appear of notic thi civil reflect
but it mean did not escap nor wa it like to concili her
but it is not mere thi affair she continu on which my dislik
is found long befor it had taken place my opinion of you wa
decid your charact wa unfold in the recit which i receiv
mani month ago from mr wickham on thi subject what can you have to
sai in what imaginari act of friendship can you here defend yourself
or under what misrepresent can you here impos upon other
you take an eager interest in that gentleman concern said darci
in a less tranquil tone and with a heighten colour
who that know what hi misfortun have been can help feel an

hi misfortun repeat darci contemptuouslyy hi
misfortun have been great inde

have withheld the advantag which you must know to have been design
for him you have depriv the best year of hi life of that
independ which wa no less hi due than hi desert you have done
all thi and yet you can treat the mention of hi misfortun with
contempt and ridicul
and thi cri darci as he walk with quick step across the room
is your opinion of me thi is the estim in which you hold me i
thank you for explain it so fulli my fault accord to thi
calcul ar heavi inde but perhap ad he stop in hi

overlook had not your pride been hurt by my honest confess of the

nor am i asham of the feel i relat thei were natur and just
could you expect me to rejoic in the inferior of your

elizabeth felt herself grow more angri everi moment yet she tri to
the utmost to speak with composur when she said
you ar mistaken mr darci if you suppos that the mode of your
declar affect me in ani other wai than as it spare me the
concern which i might have felt in refus you had you behav in a
more gentlemanlik manner
she saw him start at thi but he said noth and she continu
you could not have made me the offer of your hand in ani possibl wai
that would have tempt me to accept it
again hi astonish wa obviou and he look at her with an
express of mingl incredul and mortif she went on
from the veri begin from the first moment i mai almost sai of my
acquaint with you your manner impress me with the fullest
belief of your arrog your conceit and your selfish disdain of the
feel of other were such as to form that groundwork of
disapprob on which succeed event have built so immov a

breakfast to indulg herself in air and exercis she wa proceed
directli to her favourit walk when the recollect of mr darci
sometim come there stop her and instead of enter the park
she turn up the lane which led her farther from the turnpik road the
park pale wa still the boundari on on side and she soon pass on
of the gate into the ground
after walk two or three time along that part of the lane she wa
tempt by the pleasant of the morn to stop at the gate and
look into the park the five week which she had now pass in kent had
made a great differ in the countri and everi dai wa ad to the
verdur of the earli tree she wa on the point of continu her
walk when she caught a glimps of a gentleman within the sort of grove
which edg the park he wa move that wai and fear of it be

now near enough to see her and step forward with eager
pronounc her name she had turn awai but on hear herself call
though in a voic which prove it to be mr darci she move again
toward the gate he had by that time reach it also and hold out

prosper and blast the prospect of mr wickham wilfulli and
wantonli to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledg
favourit of my father a young man who had scarc ani other

it exert would be a deprav to which the separ of two young
person whose affect could be the growth of onli a few week could
bear no comparison but from the sever of that blame which wa last
night so liber bestow respect each circumst i shall hope
to be in futur secur when the follow account of my action and
their motiv ha been read if in the explan of them which is due
to myself i am under the necess of relat feel which mai be

be obei and further apolog would be absurd i had not been long in
hertfordshir befor i saw in common with other that binglei
prefer your elder sister to ani other young woman in the countri but
it wa not till the even of the danc at netherfield that i had ani
apprehens of hi feel a seriou attach i had often seen him
in love befor at that ball while i had the honour of danc with
you i wa first made acquaint by sir william lucass accident
inform that binglei attent to your sister had given rise to
a gener expect of their marriag he spoke of it as a certain
event of which the time alon could be undecid from that moment i
observ my friend behaviour attent and i could then perceiv
that hi partial for miss bennet wa beyond what i had ever wit
in him your sister i also watch her look and manner were open
cheer and engag as ever but without ani symptom of peculiar
regard and i remain convinc from the even scrutini that
though she receiv hi attent with pleasur she did not invit
them by ani particip of sentiment if you have not been mistaken
here i must have been in an error your superior knowledg of your
sister must make the latter probabl if it be so if i have been misl
by such error to inflict pain on her your resent ha not been
unreason but i shall not scrupl to assert that the seren of
your sister counten and air wa such as might have given the most
acut observ a convict that howev amiabl her temper her heart
wa not like to be easili touch that i wa desir of believ
her indiffer is certain but i will ventur to sai that my
investig and decis ar not usual influenc by my hope or
fear i did not believ her to be indiffer becaus i wish it i
believ it on imparti convict as truli as i wish it in reason
my object to the marriag were not mere those which i last night
acknowledg to have requir the utmost forc of passion to put asid
in my own case the want of connect could not be so great an evil to
my friend as to me but there were other caus of repugn caus
which though still exist and exist to an equal degre in both
instanc i had myself endeavour to forget becaus thei were not
immedi befor me these caus must be state though briefli the
situat of your mother famili though objection wa noth in
comparison of that total want of proprieti so frequent so almost
uniformli betrai by herself by your three younger sister and
occasion even by your fatherpardon meit pain me to offend
you but amidst your concern for the defect of your nearest relat
and your displeasur at thi represent of them let it give you
consol to consid that to have conduct yourselv so as to avoid
ani share of the like censur is prais no less gener bestow on
you and your eldest sister than it is honour to the sens and
disposit of both i will onli sai farther that from what pass
that even my opinion of all parti wa confirm and everi
induc heighten which could have led me befor to preserv my
friend from what i esteem a most unhappi connect he left
netherfield for london on the dai follow as you i am certain
rememb with the design of soon return the part which i act is
now to be explain hi sister uneasi had been equal excit
with my own our coincid of feel wa soon discov and alik

earnestli but howev thi remonstr might have stagger or delai
hi determin i do not suppos that it would ultim have
prevent the marriag had it not been second by the assur which
i hesit not in give of your sister indiffer he had befor
believ her to return hi affect with sincer if not with equal
regard but binglei ha great natur modesti with a stronger
depend on my judgment than on hi own to convinc him therefor
that he had deceiv himself wa no veri difficult point to persuad
him against return into hertfordshir when that convict had been
given wa scarc the work of a moment i cannot blame myself for
have done thu much there is but on part of my conduct in the whole
affair on which i do not reflect with satisfact it is that i
condescend to adopt the measur of art so far as to conceal from him
your sister be in town i knew it myself as it wa known to miss
binglei but her brother is even yet ignor of it that thei might
have met without ill consequ is perhap probabl but hi regard
did not appear to me enough extinguish for him to see her without some
danger perhap thi conceal thi disguis wa beneath me it is
done howev and it wa done for the best on thi subject i have
noth more to sai no other apolog to offer if i have wound your

mr wickham is the son of a veri respect man who had for mani year

therefor liber bestow my father support him at school and
afterward at cambridg most import assist as hi own father
alwai poor from the extravag of hi wife would have been unabl to
give him a gentleman educ my father wa not onli fond of thi
young man societi whose manner were alwai engag he had also the
highest opinion of him and hope the church would be hi profess
intend to provid for him in it as for myself it is mani mani year
sinc i first began to think of him in a veri differ manner the
viciou propens the want of principl which he wa care to
guard from the knowledg of hi best friend could not escap the
observ of a young man of nearli the same ag with himself and who
had opportun of see him in unguard moment which mr darci
could not have here again i shall give you painto what degre you
onli can tell but whatev mai be the sentiment which mr wickham ha
creat a suspicion of their natur shall not prevent me from unfold
hi real charact it add even anoth motiv my excel father
di about five year ago and hi attach to mr wickham wa to the
last so steadi that in hi will he particularli recommend it to me to
promot hi advanc in the best manner that hi profess might
allow and if he took order desir that a valuabl famili live
might be hi as soon as it becam vacant there wa also a legaci of
on thousand pound hi own father did not long surviv mine and
within half a year from these event mr wickham wrote to inform me
that have final resolv against take order he hope i should
not think it unreason for him to expect some more immedi
pecuniari advantag in lieu of the prefer by which he could not be
benefit he had some intent he ad of studi the law and i

incauti shown everi linger struggl in hi favour grew fainter
and fainter and in further justif of mr darci she could not

that friendship between a person capabl of it and such an amiabl man

there had appear veri insuffici and she read it again wide

of her sister attach and she could not help rememb what
charlott opinion had alwai been neither could she deni the justic
of hi descript of jane she felt that jane feel though

when she came to that part of the letter in which her famili were

for denial and the circumst to which he particularli allud as

did not know him in the least lord how i laugh and so did mr
forster i thought i should have di and that made the men suspect
someth and then thei soon found out what wa the matter
with such kind of histori of their parti and good joke did lydia
assist by kitti hint and addit endeavour to amus her
companion all the wai to longbourn elizabeth listen as littl as she
could but there wa no escap the frequent mention of wickham name
their recept at home wa most kind mr bennet rejoic to see jane

came to meet maria and hear the new and variou were the subject
which occupi them ladi luca wa inquir of maria across the
tabl after the welfar and poultri of her eldest daughter mr bennet
wa doubli engag on on hand collect an account of the present
fashion from jane who sat some wai below her and on the other
retail them all to the younger miss lucas and lydia in a voic
rather louder than ani other person wa enumer the variou
pleasur of the morn to anybodi who would hear her
oh mari said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun
as we went along kitti and me drew up all the blind and pretend
there wa nobodi in the coach and i should have gone so all the wai if
kitti had not been sick and when we got to the georg i do think we
behav veri handsom for we treat the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have
treat you too and then when we came awai it wa such fun i thought
we never should have got into the coach i wa readi to die of laughter
and then we were so merri all the wai home we talk and laugh so
loud that anybodi might have heard us ten mile off
to thi mari veri grave repli far be it from me my dear sister
to depreci such pleasur thei would doubtless be congeni with the
gener of femal mind but i confess thei would have no charm for
me i should infinit prefer a book
but of thi answer lydia heard not a word she seldom listen to
anybodi for more than half a minut and never attend to mari at all
in the afternoon lydia wa urgent with the rest of the girl to walk to
meryton and see how everybodi went on but elizabeth steadili oppos
the scheme it should not be said that the miss bennet could not be at
home half a dai befor thei were in pursuit of the offic there wa
anoth reason too for her opposit she dread see wickham

her of the regiment approach remov wa inde beyond
express in a fortnight thei were to go and onc gone she hope
there could be noth more to plagu her on hi account
she had not been mani hour at home befor she found that the brighton
scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn wa under
frequent discuss between her parent elizabeth saw directli that her
father had not the smallest intent of yield but hi answer were
at the same time so vagu and equivoc that her mother though often

miss bennet astonish wa soon lessen by the strong sisterli
partial which made ani admir of elizabeth appear perfectli

sorri that mr darci should have deliv hi sentiment in a manner so
littl suit to recommend them but still more wa she griev for the

you do not blame me howev for refus him
blame you oh no
but you blame me for have spoken so warmli of wickham
noi do not know that you were wrong in sai what you did
but you will know it when i have told you what happen the veri

she then spoke of the letter repeat the whole of it content as far
as thei concern georg wickham what a stroke wa thi for poor jane
who would willingli have gone through the world without believ that
so much wicked exist in the whole race of mankind as wa here
collect in on individu nor wa darci vindic though
grate to her feel capabl of consol her for such discoveri
most earnestli did she labour to prove the probabl of error and
seek to clear on without involv the other
thi will not do said elizabeth you never will be abl to make both
of them good for anyth take your choic but you must be satisfi
with onli on there is but such a quantiti of merit between them just
enough to make on good sort of man and of late it ha been shift
about pretti much for my part i am inclin to believ it all mr
darci but you shall do as you choos
it wa some time howev befor a smile could be extort from jane
i do not know when i have been more shock said she wickham so
veri bad it is almost past belief and poor mr darci dear lizzi
onli consid what he must have suffer such a disappoint and
with the knowledg of your ill opinion too and have to relat such a
thing of hi sister it is realli too distress i am sure you must
feel it so
oh no my regret and compass ar all done awai by see you so full
of both i know you will do him such ampl justic that i am grow
everi moment more unconcern and indiffer your profus make me
save and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as
light as a feather
poor wickham there is such an express of good in hi
counten such an open and gentl in hi manner
there certainli wa some great mismanag in the educ of those
two young men on ha got all the good and the other all the
appear of it
i never thought mr darci so defici in the appear of it as you

and yet i meant to be uncommonli clever in take so decid a dislik
to him without ani reason it is such a spur to on geniu such an
open for wit to have a dislik of that kind on mai be continu
abus without sai anyth just but on cannot be alwai laugh
at a man without now and then stumbl on someth witti
lizzi when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now
inde i could not i wa uncomfort enough i wa veri
uncomfortablei mai sai unhappi and with no on to speak to of what i
felt no jane to comfort me and sai that i had not been so veri weak
and vain and nonsens as i knew i had oh how i want you
how unfortun that you should have us such veri strong express
in speak of wickham to mr darci for now thei do appear wholli
undeserv
certainli but the misfortun of speak with bitter is a most
natur consequ of the prejudic i had been encourag there is
on point on which i want your advic i want to be told whether i
ought or ought not to make our acquaint in gener understand
wickham charact
miss bennet paus a littl and then repli sure there can be no
occas for expos him so dreadfulli what is your own opinion
that it ought not to be attempt mr darci ha not author me to
make hi commun public on the contrari everi particular
rel to hi sister wa meant to be kept as much as possibl to
myself and if i endeavour to undec peopl as to the rest of hi
conduct who will believ me the gener prejudic against mr darci is
so violent that it would be the death of half the good peopl in
meryton to attempt to place him in an amiabl light i am not equal to
it wickham will soon be gone and therefor it will not signifi to
anybodi here what he realli is some time henc it will be all found
out and then we mai laugh at their stupid in not know it befor
at present i will sai noth about it
you ar quit right to have hi error made public might ruin him for
ever he is now perhap sorri for what he ha done and anxiou to
reestablish a charact we must not make him desper
the tumult of elizabeth mind wa allai by thi convers she
had got rid of two of the secret which had weigh on her for a
fortnight and wa certain of a will listen in jane whenev she
might wish to talk again of either but there wa still someth
lurk behind of which prudenc forbad the disclosur she dare not
relat the other half of mr darci letter nor explain to her sister
how sincer she had been valu by hi friend here wa knowledg in
which no on could partak and she wa sensibl that noth less than
a perfect understand between the parti could justifi her in
throw off thi last encumbr of mysteri and then said she if
that veri improb event should ever take place i shall mere be
abl to tell what binglei mai tell in a much more agreeabl manner
himself the liberti of commun cannot be mine till it ha lost
all it valu
she wa now on be settl at home at leisur to observ the real
state of her sister spirit jane wa not happi she still cherish a
veri tender affect for binglei have never even fanci herself in
love befor her regard had all the warmth of first attach and from
her ag and disposit greater steadi than first attach often
boast and so fervent did she valu hi remembr and prefer him to
everi other man that all her good sens and all her attent to the
feel of her friend were requisit to check the indulg of those
regret which must have been injuri to her own health and their
tranquil
well lizzi said mr bennet on dai what is your opinion now of
thi sad busi of jane for my part i am determin never to speak
of it again to anybodi i told my sister philip so the other dai but i
cannot find out that jane saw anyth of him in london well he is a
veri undeserv young manand i do not suppos there is the least
chanc in the world of her ever get him now there is no talk of hi
come to netherfield again in the summer and i have inquir of
everybodi too who is like to know
illustr
i am determin never to speak of it again
i do not believ that he will ever live at netherfield ani more
oh well it is just as he choos nobodi want him to come though i
shall alwai sai that he us my daughter extrem ill and if i wa
her i would not have put up with it well my comfort is i am sure
jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorri for what he
ha done
but as elizabeth could not receiv comfort from ani such expect she
made no answer
well lizzi continu her mother soon afterward and so the
collins live veri comfort do thei well well i onli hope it
will last and what sort of tabl do thei keep charlott is an
excel manag i dare sai if she is half as sharp as her mother
she is save enough there is noth extravag in their

no noth at all
a great deal of good manag depend upon it ye ye thei will
take care not to outrun their incom thei will never be distress
for monei well much good mai it do them and so i suppos thei often

it wa a subject which thei could not mention befor me
no it would have been strang if thei had but i make no doubt thei

lydia will never be easi till she ha expos herself in some public

elizabeth as thei drove along watch for the first appear of
pemberlei wood with some perturb and when at length thei turn
in at the lodg her spirit were in a high flutter
the park wa veri larg and contain great varieti of ground thei
enter it in on of it lowest point and drove for some time through
a beauti wood stretch over a wide extent
elizabeth mind wa too full for convers but she saw and admir
everi remark spot and point of view thei gradual ascend for
half a mile and then found themselv at the top of a consider
emin where the wood ceas and the ey wa instantli caught by
pemberlei hous situat on the opposit side of the vallei into which
the road with some abrupt wound it wa a larg handsom stone
build stand well on rise ground and back by a ridg of high
woodi hill and in front a stream of some natur import wa
swell into greater but without ani artifici appear it bank
were neither formal nor fals adorn elizabeth wa delight she
had never seen a place for which natur had done more or where natur
beauti had been so littl counteract by an awkward tast thei were
all of them warm in their admir and at that moment she felt that
to be mistress of pemberlei might be someth
thei descend the hill cross the bridg and drove to the door and
while examin the nearer aspect of the hous all her apprehens of

mistaken on appli to see the place thei were admit into the

which thei had descend receiv increas abrupt from the
distanc wa a beauti object everi disposit of the ground wa
good and she look on the whole scene the river the tree scatter
on it bank and the wind of the vallei as far as she could trace
it with delight as thei pass into other room these object were
take differ posit but from everi window there were beauti
to be seen the room were lofti and handsom and their furnitur
suitabl to the fortun of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with
admir of hi tast that it wa neither gaudi nor uselessli
finewith less of splendour and more real eleg than the
furnitur of rose
and of thi place thought she i might have been mistress with
these room i might have now been familiarli acquaint instead of
view them as a stranger i might have rejoic in them as my own and
welcom to them as visitor my uncl and aunt but no recollect
herself that could never be my uncl and aunt would have been lost to

ask by her uncl and she turn awai with alarm while mr reynold
repli that he wa ad but we expect him tomorrow with a larg

and she listen with increas astonish as the housekeep ad
i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him
ever sinc he wa four year old
thi wa prais of all other most extraordinari most opposit to her
idea that he wa not a goodtemp man had been her firmest opinion
her keenest attent wa awaken she long to hear more and wa
grate to her uncl for sai
there ar veri few peopl of whom so much can be said you ar lucki in

elizabeth almost stare at her can thi be mr darci thought she

ye maam that he wa inde and hi son will be just like himjust
as affabl to the poor
elizabeth listen wonder doubt and wa impati for more mr
reynold could interest her on no other point she relat the subject
of the pictur the dimens of the room and the price of the
furnitur in vain mr gardin highli amus by the kind of famili
prejudic to which he attribut her excess commend of her
master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energi on hi
mani merit as thei proceed togeth up the great staircas
he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever
live not like the wild young men nowadai who think of noth but
themselv there is not on of hi tenant or servant but what will
give him a good name some peopl call him proud but i am sure i never
saw anyth of it to my fanci it is onli becaus he doe not rattl
awai like other young men
in what an amiabl light doe thi place him thought elizabeth
thi fine account of him whisper her aunt as thei walk is not
quit consist with hi behaviour to our poor friend
perhap we might be deceiv
that is not veri like our author wa too good
on reach the spaciou lobbi abov thei were shown into a veri pretti
sittingroom late fit up with greater eleg and light than
the apart below and were inform that it wa but just done to
give pleasur to miss darci who had taken a like to the room when
last at pemberlei
he is certainli a good brother said elizabeth as she walk toward
on of the window
mr reynold anticip miss darci delight when she should enter
the room and thi is alwai the wai with him she ad whatev
can give hi sister ani pleasur is sure to be done in a moment there
is noth he would not do for her
the pictur galleri and two or three of the princip bedroom were
all that remain to be shown in the former were mani good paint
but elizabeth knew noth of the art and from such as had been alreadi
visibl below she had willingli turn to look at some draw of miss
darci in crayon whose subject were usual more interest and
also more intellig
in the galleri there were mani famili portrait but thei could have
littl to fix the attent of a stranger elizabeth walk on in quest
of the onli face whose featur would be known to her at last it
arrest herand she beheld a strike resembl of mr darci with
such a smile over the face as she rememb to have sometim seen
when he look at her she stood sever minut befor the pictur in
earnest contempl and return to it again befor thei quit the
galleri mr reynold inform them that it had been taken in hi
father lifetim
there wa certainli at thi moment in elizabeth mind a more gentl
sensat toward the origin than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaint the commend bestow on him by mr reynold
wa of no trifl natur what prais is more valuabl than the prais
of an intellig servant as a brother a landlord a master she
consid how mani peopl happi were in hi guardianship how
much of pleasur or pain it wa in hi power to bestow how much of good
or evil must be done by him everi idea that had been brought forward by
the housekeep wa favour to hi charact and as she stood befor
the canva on which he wa repres and fix hi ey upon
herself she thought of hi regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitud
than it had ever rais befor she rememb it warmth and soften
it improprieti of express
when all of the hous that wa open to gener inspect had been seen
thei return down stair and take leav of the housekeep were
consign over to the garden who met them at the hall door
as thei walk across the lawn toward the river elizabeth turn back
to look again her uncl and aunt stop also and while the former wa
conjectur as to the date of the build the owner of it himself
suddenli came forward from the road which led behind it to the stabl
thei were within twenti yard of each other and so abrupt wa hi
appear that it wa imposs to avoid hi sight their ey
instantli met and the cheek of each were overspread with the deepest
blush he absolut start and for a moment seem immov from
surpris but shortli recov himself advanc toward the parti
and spoke to elizabeth if not in term of perfect composur at least
of perfect civil
she had instinct turn awai but stop on hi approach
receiv hi compliment with an embarrass imposs to be
overcom had hi first appear or hi resembl to the pictur
thei had just been examin been insuffici to assur the other two
that thei now saw mr darci the garden express of surpris on
behold hi master must immedi have told it thei stood a littl
aloof while he wa talk to their niec who astonish and confus
scarc dare lift her ey to hi face and knew not what answer she
return to hi civil inquiri after her famili amaz at the
alter of hi manner sinc thei last part everi sentenc that he
utter wa increas her embarrass and everi idea of the
improprieti of her be found there recur to her mind the few
minut in which thei continu togeth were some of the most
uncomfort of her life nor did he seem much more at eas when he
spoke hi accent had none of it usual sedat and he repeat hi
inquiri as to the time of her have left longbourn and of her stai
in derbyshir so often and in so hurri a wai as plainli spoke the
distract of hi thought
at length everi idea seem to fail him and after stand a few
moment without sai a word he suddenli recollect himself and took
leav
the other then join her and express their admir of hi
figur but elizabeth heard not a word and wholli engross by her own
feel follow them in silenc she wa overpow by shame and
vexat her come there wa the most unfortun the most illjudg
thing in the world how strang must it appear to him in what a
disgrac light might it not strike so vain a man it might seem as if
she had purpos thrown herself in hi wai again oh why did she come
or why did he thu come a dai befor he wa expect had thei been
onli ten minut sooner thei should have been beyond the reach of hi
discrimin for it wa plain that he wa that moment arriv that
moment alight from hi hors or hi carriag she blush again and
again over the pervers of the meet and hi behaviour so
strikingli alteredwhat could it mean that he should even speak to
her wa amazingbut to speak with such civil to inquir after her
famili never in her life had she seen hi manner so littl dignifi
never had he spoken with such gentl as on thi unexpect meet
what a contrast did it offer to hi last address in rose park when
he put hi letter into her hand she knew not what to think or how to
account for it
thei had now enter a beauti walk by the side of the water and
everi step wa bring forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer
reach of the wood to which thei were approach but it wa some time
befor elizabeth wa sensibl of ani of it and though she answer
mechan to the repeat appeal of her uncl and aunt and seem
to direct her ey to such object as thei point out she
distinguish no part of the scene her thought were all fix on that
on spot of pemberlei hous whichev it might be where mr darci then
wa she long to know what at that moment wa pass in hi mind in
what manner he thought of her and whether in defianc of everyth
she wa still dear to him perhap he had been civil onli becaus he
felt himself at eas yet there had been that in hi voic which wa
not like eas whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasur in see
her she could not tell but he certainli had not seen her with
composur
at length howev the remark of her companion on her absenc of mind
rous her and she felt the necess of appear more like herself
thei enter the wood and bid adieu to the river for a while
ascend some of the higher ground whenc in spot where the open
of the tree gave the ey power to wander were mani charm view of
the vallei the opposit hill with the long rang of wood
overspread mani and occasion part of the stream mr gardin
express a wish of go round the whole park but fear it might be
beyond a walk with a triumphant smile thei were told that it wa ten
mile round it settl the matter and thei pursu the accustom
circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among
hang wood to the edg of the water and on of it narrowest part
thei cross it by a simpl bridg in charact with the gener air of
the scene it wa a spot less adorn than ani thei had yet visit and
the vallei here contract into a glen allow room onli for the
stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which border
it elizabeth long to explor it wind but when thei had cross
the bridg and perceiv their distanc from the hous mr gardin
who wa not a great walker could go no farther and thought onli of
return to the carriag as quickli as possibl her niec wa
therefor oblig to submit and thei took their wai toward the hous
on the opposit side of the river in the nearest direct but their
progress wa slow for mr gardin though seldom abl to indulg the
tast wa veri fond of fish and wa so much engag in watch the
occasion appear of some trout in the water and talk to the man
about them that he advanc but littl whilst wander on in thi
slow manner thei were again surpris and elizabeth astonish wa
quit equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darci
approach them and at no great distanc the walk be here less
shelter than on the other side allow them to see him befor thei
met elizabeth howev astonish wa at least more prepar for an
interview than befor and resolv to appear and to speak with
calm if he realli intend to meet them for a few moment inde
she felt that he would probabl strike into some other path the idea
last while a turn in the walk conceal him from their view the
turn past he wa immedi befor them with a glanc she saw that
he had lost none of hi recent civil and to imit hi polit
she began as thei met to admir the beauti of the place but she had not
got beyond the word delight and charm when some unlucki
recollect obtrud and she fanci that prais of pemberlei from
her might be mischiev constru her colour chang and she said
no more
mr gardin wa stand a littl behind and on her paus he ask
her if she would do him the honour of introduc him to her friend
thi wa a stroke of civil for which she wa quit unprepar and
she could hardli suppress a smile at hi be now seek the
acquaint of some of those veri peopl against whom hi pride had
revolt in hi offer to herself what will be hi surpris thought
she when he know who thei ar he take them now for peopl of
fashion
the introduct howev wa immedi made and as she name their
relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore
it and wa not without the expect of hi decamp as fast as he
could from such disgrac companion that he wa surpris by the
connect wa evid he sustain it howev with fortitud and
so far from go awai turn back with them and enter into
convers with mr gardin elizabeth could not but be pleas
could not but triumph it wa consol that he should know she had some
relat for whom there wa no need to blush she listen most
attent to all that pass between them and glori in everi
express everi sentenc of her uncl which mark hi intellig
hi tast or hi good manner
the convers soon turn upon fish and she heard mr darci
invit him with the greatest civil to fish there as often as he
chose while he continu in the neighbourhood offer at the same
time to suppli him with fish tackl and point out those part of
the stream where there wa usual most sport mr gardin who wa
walk arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look express of her
wonder elizabeth said noth but it gratifi her exceedingli the
compliment must be all for herself her astonish howev wa
extrem and continu wa she repeat why is he so alter from
what can it proce it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake
that hi manner ar thu soften my reproof at hunsford could not
work such a chang as thi it is imposs that he should still love
me
after walk some time in thi wai the two ladi in front the two
gentlemen behind on resum their place after descend to the
brink of the river for the better inspect of some curiou
waterpl there chanc to be a littl alter it origin in
mr gardin who fatigu by the exercis of the morn found
elizabeth arm inadequ to her support and consequ prefer
her husband mr darci took her place by her niec and thei walk on
togeth after a short silenc the ladi first spoke she wish him to
know that she had been assur of hi absenc befor she came to the
place and accordingli began by observ that hi arriv had been
veri unexpectedfor your housekeep she ad inform us that
you would certainli not be here till tomorrow and inde befor we
left bakewel we understood that you were not immedi expect in
the countri he acknowledg the truth of it all and said that
busi with hi steward had occas hi come forward a few hour
befor the rest of the parti with whom he had been travel thei
will join me earli tomorrow he continu and among them ar some
who will claim an acquaint with youmr binglei and hi sister
elizabeth answer onli by a slight bow her thought were instantli
driven back to the time when mr binglei name had been last mention
between them and if she might judg from hi complexion hi mind wa
not veri differ engag
there is also on other person in the parti he continu after a
paus who more particularli wish to be known to you will you allow
me or do i ask too much to introduc my sister to your acquaint
dure your stai at lambton
the surpris of such an applic wa great inde it wa too great
for her to know in what manner she acced to it she immedi felt
that whatev desir miss darci might have of be acquaint with her
must be the work of her brother and without look farther it wa
satisfactori it wa gratifi to know that hi resent had not made
him think realli ill of her
thei now walk on in silenc each of them deep in thought elizabeth
wa not comfort that wa imposs but she wa flatter and
pleas hi wish of introduc hi sister to her wa a compliment of
the highest kind thei soon outstrip the other and when thei had
reach the carriag mr and mr gardin were half a quarter of a
mile behind
he then ask her to walk into the housebut she declar herself not
tire and thei stood togeth on the lawn at such a time much might
have been said and silenc wa veri awkward she want to talk but
there seem an embargo on everi subject at last she recollect that
she had been travel and thei talk of matlock and dovedal with
great persever yet time and her aunt move slowlyand her patienc
and her idea were nearli worn out befor the ttett wa over
on mr and mr gardin come up thei were all press to go into
the hous and take some refresh but thi wa declin and thei
part on each side with the utmost polit mr darci hand the
ladi into the carriag and when it drove off elizabeth saw him
walk slowli toward the hous
the observ of her uncl and aunt now began and each of them
pronounc him to be infinit superior to anyth thei had expect
he is perfectli wellbehav polit and unassum said her uncl
there is someth a littl state in him to be sure repli her
aunt but it is confin to hi air and is not unbecom i can now
sai with the housekeep that though some peopl mai call him proud
i have seen noth of it
i wa never more surpris than by hi behaviour to us it wa more
than civil it wa realli attent and there wa no necess for such
attent hi acquaint with elizabeth wa veri trifl
to be sure lizzi said her aunt he is not so handsom as wickham
or rather he ha not wickham counten for hi featur ar
perfectli good but how came you to tell us that he wa so
disagre
elizabeth excus herself as well as she could said that she had like
him better when thei met in kent than befor and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as thi morn
but perhap he mai be a littl whimsic in hi civil repli
her uncl your great men often ar and therefor i shall not take him
at hi word about fish as he might chang hi mind anoth dai and
warn me off hi ground
elizabeth felt that thei had entir mistaken hi charact but said
noth
from what we have seen of him continu mr gardin i realli
should not have thought that he could have behav in so cruel a wai by
anybodi as he ha done by poor wickham he ha not an illnatur look
on the contrari there is someth pleas about hi mouth when he
speak and there is someth of digniti in hi counten that would
not give on an unfavour idea of hi heart but to be sure the
good ladi who show us the hous did give him a most flame charact
i could hardli help laugh aloud sometim but he is a liber
master i suppos and that in the ey of a servant comprehend
everi virtu
elizabeth here felt herself call on to sai someth in vindic of
hi behaviour to wickham and therefor gave them to understand in as
guard a manner as she could that by what she had heard from hi
relat in kent hi action were capabl of a veri differ
construct and that hi charact wa by no mean so faulti nor
wickham so amiabl as thei had been consid in hertfordshir in
confirm of thi she relat the particular of all the pecuniari
transact in which thei had been connect without actual name
her author but state it to be such as might be reli on
mr gardin wa surpris and concern but as thei were now
approach the scene of her former pleasur everi idea gave wai to
the charm of recollect and she wa too much engag in point out
to her husband all the interest spot in it environ to think of
anyth els fatigu as she had been by the morn walk thei had
no sooner dine than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaint and the even wa spent in the satisfact of an
intercours renew after mani year discontinu
the occurr of the dai were too full of interest to leav elizabeth
much attent for ani of these new friend and she could do noth
but think and think with wonder of mr darci civil and abov
all of hi wish her to be acquaint with hi sister

elizabeth had settl it that mr darci would bring hi sister to visit
her the veri dai after her reach pemberlei and wa consequ
resolv not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morn
but her conclus wa fals for on the veri morn after their own
arriv at lambton these visitor came thei had been walk about the
place with some of their new friend and were just return to the inn
to dress themselv for dine with the same famili when the sound of a
carriag drew them to a window and thei saw a gentleman and ladi in a
curricl drive up the street elizabeth immedi recogn the
liveri guess what it meant and impart no small degre of surpris
to her relat by acquaint them with the honour which she
expect her uncl and aunt were all amaz and the embarrass
of her manner as she spoke join to the circumst itself and mani
of the circumst of the preced dai open to them a new idea on
the busi noth had ever suggest it befor but thei now felt
that there wa no other wai of account for such attent from such
a quarter than by suppos a partial for their niec while these
newlyborn notion were pass in their head the perturb of
elizabeth feel wa everi moment increas she wa quit amaz
at her own discomposur but amongst other caus of disquiet she
dread lest the partial of the brother should have said too much in
her favour and more than commonli anxiou to pleas she natur
suspect that everi power of pleas would fail her
she retreat from the window fear of be seen and as she walk
up and down the room endeavour to compos herself saw such look of
inquir surpris in her uncl and aunt as made everyth wors
miss darci and her brother appear and thi formid introduct
took place with astonish did elizabeth see that her new
acquaint wa at least as much embarrass as herself sinc her
be at lambton she had heard that miss darci wa exceedingli proud
but the observ of a veri few minut convinc her that she wa
onli exceedingli shy she found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyl
miss darci wa tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though
littl more than sixteen her figur wa form and her appear
womanli and grace she wa less handsom than her brother but there
wa sens and goodhumour in her face and her manner were perfectli
unassum and gentl elizabeth who had expect to find in her as
acut and unembarrass an observ as ever mr darci had been wa much
reliev by discern such differ feel
thei had not been long togeth befor darci told her that binglei wa
also come to wait on her and she had bare time to express her
satisfact and prepar for such a visitor when binglei quick step
wa heard on the stair and in a moment he enter the room all
elizabeth anger against him had been long done awai but had she still
felt ani it could hardli have stood it ground against the unaffect
cordial with which he express himself on see her again he
inquir in a friendli though gener wai after her famili and
look and spoke with the same goodhumour eas that he had ever done
to mr and mr gardin he wa scarc a less interest personag
than to herself thei had long wish to see him the whole parti befor
them inde excit a live attent the suspicion which had just
arisen of mr darci and their niec direct their observ toward
each with an earnest though guard inquiri and thei soon drew from
those inquiri the full convict that on of them at least knew what
it wa to love of the ladi sensat thei remain a littl in
doubt but that the gentleman wa overflow with admir wa
evid enough
elizabeth on her side had much to do she want to ascertain the
feel of each of her visitor she want to compos her own and to
make herself agreeabl to all and in the latter object where she
fear most to fail she wa most sure of success for those to whom

how ardent did she long to know whether ani of hi were direct in a
like manner sometim she could fanci that he talk less than on
former occas and onc or twice pleas herself with the notion
that as he look at her he wa try to trace a resembl but
though thi might be imaginari she could not be deceiv as to hi
behaviour to miss darci who had been set up as a rival to jane no

thi point she wa soon satisfi and two or three littl circumst

nor in the preced remark but there wa a look and a manner which
gave them mean
it wa not often that she could turn her ey on mr darci himself but
whenev she did catch a glimps she saw an express of gener
complais and in all that he said she heard an accent so far
remov from hauteur or disdain of hi companion as convinc her
that the improv of manner which she had yesterdai wit
howev temporari it exist might prove had at least outliv on
dai when she saw him thu seek the acquaint and court the
good opinion of peopl with whom ani intercours a few month ago would
have been a disgrac when she saw him thu civil not onli to herself
but to the veri relat whom he had openli disdain and recollect
their last live scene in hunsford parsonag the differ the
chang wa so great and struck so forcibl on her mind that she could
hardli restrain her astonish from be visibl never even in the
compani of hi dear friend at netherfield or hi dignifi relat
at rose had she seen him so desir to pleas so free from
selfconsequ or unbend reserv as now when no import could
result from the success of hi endeavour and when even the
acquaint of those to whom hi attent were address would draw
down the ridicul and censur of the ladi both of netherfield and
rose
their visitor stai with them abov half an hour and when thei aros
to depart mr darci call on hi sister to join him in express
their wish of see mr and mr gardin and miss bennet to dinner
at pemberlei befor thei left the countri miss darci though with a
diffid which mark her littl in the habit of give invit

again have still a great deal to sai to her and mani inquiri to
make after all their hertfordshir friend elizabeth constru all
thi into a wish of hear her speak of her sister wa pleas and
on thi account as well as some other found herself when their
visitor left them capabl of consid the last half hour with some
satisfact though while it wa pass the enjoy of it had been
littl eager to be alon and fear of inquiri or hint from her
uncl and aunt she stai with them onli long enough to hear their
favour opinion of binglei and then hurri awai to dress
but she had no reason to fear mr and mr gardin curios it wa
not their wish to forc her commun it wa evid that she wa
much better acquaint with mr darci than thei had befor ani idea of

interest but noth to justifi inquiri
of mr darci it wa now a matter of anxieti to think well and as far
as their acquaint reach there wa no fault to find thei could
not be untouch by hi polit and had thei drawn hi charact
from their own feel and hi servant report without ani refer
to ani other account the circl in hertfordshir to which he wa known
would not have recogn it for mr darci there wa now an interest
howev in believ the housekeep and thei soon becam sensibl

noth to accus him of but pride pride he probabl had and if not

where the famili did not visit it wa acknowledg howev that he
wa a liber man and did much good among the poor
with respect to wickham the travel soon found that he wa not held
there in much estim for though the chief of hi concern with the
son of hi patron were imperfectli understood it wa yet a wellknown
fact that on hi quit derbyshir he had left mani debt behind
him which mr darci afterward discharg
as for elizabeth her thought were at pemberlei thi even more than
the last and the even though as it pass it seem long wa not
long enough to determin her feel toward on in that mansion and

she most fear or wish for the appear of mr darci by the
feel which prevail on hi enter the room and then though but
a moment befor she had believ her wish to predomin she began to
regret that he came
he had been some time with mr gardin who with two or three other
gentlemen from the hous wa engag by the river and had left him
onli on learn that the ladi of the famili intend a visit to
georgiana that morn no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wise
resolv to be perfectli easi and unembarrasseda resolut the more
necessari to be made but perhap not the more easili kept becaus she
saw that the suspicion of the whole parti were awaken against them
and that there wa scarc an ey which did not watch hi behaviour
when he first came into the room in no counten wa attent
curios so strongli mark as in miss binglei in spite of the
smile which overspread her face whenev she spoke to on of it
object for jealousi had not yet made her desper and her attent

binglei saw all thi likewis and in the imprud of anger took the
first opportun of sai with sneer civil
prai miss eliza ar not the shire militia remov from meryton

in darci presenc she dare not mention wickham name but elizabeth

but exert herself vigor to repel the illnatur attack she
present answer the question in a toler disengag tone while

refrain from the hint but she had mere intend to discompos
elizabeth by bring forward the idea of a man to whom she believ
her partial to make her betrai a sensibl which might injur her in
darci opinion and perhap to remind the latter of all the folli
and absurd by which some part of her famili were connect with
that corp not a syllabl had ever reach her of miss darci
medit elop to no creatur had it been reveal where secreci
wa possibl except to elizabeth and from all binglei connect
her brother wa particularli anxiou to conceal it from that veri wish
which elizabeth had long ago attribut to him of their becom
hereaft her own he had certainli form such a plan and without
mean that it should affect hi endeavour to separ him from miss
bennet it is probabl that it might add someth to hi live concern
for the welfar of hi friend
elizabeth collect behaviour howev soon quiet hi emot and
as miss binglei vex and disappoint dare not approach nearer to

had been design to turn hi thought from elizabeth seem to have

their visit did not continu long after the question and answer abov

miss binglei wa vent her feel in critic on elizabeth
person behaviour and dress but georgiana would not join her her
brother recommend wa enough to insur her favour hi judgment
could not err and he had spoken in such term of elizabeth as to leav
georgiana without the power of find her otherwis than love and
amiabl when darci return to the saloon miss binglei could not help
repeat to him some part of what she had been sai to hi sister
how veri ill eliza bennet look thi morn mr darci she cri i
never in my life saw anyon so much alter as she is sinc the winter
she is grown so brown and coars louisa and i were agre that we
should not have known her again
howev littl mr darci might have like such an address he content
himself with coolli repli that he perceiv no other alter than
her be rather tannedno miracul consequ of travel in the
summer
for my own part she rejoin i must confess that i never could see
ani beauti in her her face is too thin her complexion ha no
brillianc and her featur ar not at all handsom her nose want
charact there is noth mark in it line her teeth ar
toler but not out of the common wai and as for her ey which
have sometim been call so fine i never could perceiv anyth
extraordinari in them thei have a sharp shrewish look which i do not
like at all and in her air altogeth there is a selfsuffici
without fashion which is intoler
persuad as miss binglei wa that darci admir elizabeth thi wa not

chang of sentiment will be neither improb nor faulti but if
otherwis if the regard spring from such sourc is unreason or
unnatur in comparison of what is so often describ as aris on a

somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partial for wickham

less interest mode of attach be that as it mai she saw him go

that wickham should marri a girl whom it wa imposs he could marri
for monei and how lydia could ever have attach him had appear
incomprehens but now it wa all too natur for such an attach
as thi she might have suffici charm and though she did not
suppos lydia to be deliber engag in an elop without the
intent of marriag she had no difficulti in believ that neither
her virtu nor her understand would preserv her from fall an easi
prei
she had never perceiv while the regiment wa in hertfordshir that
lydia had ani partial for him but she wa convinc that lydia had
want onli encourag to attach herself to anybodi sometim on

opinion it is realli too great a violat of decenc honour and
interest for him to be guilti of it i cannot think so veri ill of
wickham can you yourself lizzi so wholli give him up as to believ
him capabl of it
not perhap of neglect hi own interest but of everi other neglect
i can believ him capabl if inde it should be so but i dare not
hope it why should thei not go on to scotland if that had been the
case
in the first place repli mr gardin there is no absolut proof
that thei ar not gone to scotland
oh but their remov from the chais into a hacknei coach is such a
presumpt and besid no trace of them were to be found on the
barnet road
well thensuppos them to be in londonthei mai be there though
for the purpos of conceal for no more exception purpos it is
not like that monei should be veri abund on either side and it
might strike them that thei could be more econom though less
expediti marri in london than in scotland
but why all thi secreci why ani fear of detect why must their
marriag be privat oh no nothi is not like hi most particular
friend you see by jane account wa persuad of hi never intend
to marri her wickham will never marri a woman without some monei he
cannot afford it and what claim ha lydia what attract ha she
beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake
forego everi chanc of benefit himself by marri well as to what
restraint the apprehens of disgrac in the corp might throw on a
dishonour elop with her i am not abl to judg for i know
noth of the effect that such a step might produc but as to your
other object i am afraid it will hardli hold good lydia ha no
brother to step forward and he might imagin from my father
behaviour from hi indol and the littl attent he ha ever
seem to give to what wa go forward in hi famili that he would
do as littl and think as littl about it as ani father could do in
such a matter
but can you think that lydia is so lost to everyth but love of him
as to consent to live with him on ani other term than marriag
it doe seem and it is most shock inde repli elizabeth with
tear in her ey that a sister sens of decenc and virtu in such
a point should admit of doubt but realli i know not what to sai
perhap i am not do her justic but she is veri young she ha never
been taught to think on seriou subject and for the last half year
nai for a twelvemonth she ha been given up to noth but amus
and vaniti she ha been allow to dispos of her time in the most idl
and frivol manner and to adopt ani opinion that came in her wai
sinc the shire were first quarter in meryton noth but love
flirtat and offic have been in her head she ha been do
everyth in her power by think and talk on the subject to give
greaterwhat shall i call itsuscept to her feel which
ar natur live enough and we all know that wickham ha everi
charm of person and address that can captiv a woman
but you see that jane said her aunt doe not think so ill of
wickham as to believ him capabl of the attempt
of whom doe jane ever think ill and who is there whatev might be
their former conduct that she would believ capabl of such an attempt
till it were prove against them but jane know as well as i do what
wickham realli is we both know that he ha been proflig in everi
sens of the word that he ha neither integr nor honour that he is
as fals and deceit as he is insinu
and do you realli know all thi cri mr gardin whose curios
as to the mode of her intellig wa all aliv
i do inde repli elizabeth colour i told you the other dai
of hi infam behaviour to mr darci and you yourself when last at
longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behav with
such forbear and liber toward him and there ar other
circumst which i am not at libertywhich it is not worth while to
relat but hi li about the whole pemberlei famili ar endless from
what he said of miss darci i wa thoroughli prepar to see a proud
reserv disagre girl yet he knew to the contrari himself he
must know that she wa as amiabl and unpretend as we have found
her
but doe lydia know noth of thi can she be ignor of what you
and jane seem so well to understand
oh yesthat that is the worst of all till i wa in kent and saw
so much both of mr darci and hi relat colonel fitzwilliam i wa
ignor of the truth myself and when i return home the shire
wa to leav meryton in a week or fortnight time as that wa the
case neither jane to whom i relat the whole nor i thought it
necessari to make our knowledg public for of what us could it
appar be to anyon that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown and even when it
wa settl that lydia should go with mr forster the necess of
open her ey to hi charact never occur to me that she could
be in ani danger from the decept never enter my head that such a
consequ as thi should ensu you mai easili believ wa far
enough from my thought
when thei all remov to brighton therefor you had no reason i
suppos to believ them fond of each other
not the slightest i can rememb no symptom of affect on either
side and had anyth of the kind been percept you must be awar
that our is not a famili on which it could be thrown awai when first
he enter the corp she wa readi enough to admir him but so we all
were everi girl in or near meryton wa out of her sens about him for
the first two month but he never distinguish her by ani particular
attent and consequ after a moder period of extravag and
wild admir her fanci for him gave wai and other of the regiment
who treat her with more distinct again becam her favourit
it mai be easili believ that howev littl of novelti could be ad
to their fear hope and conjectur on thi interest subject by
it repeat discuss no other could detain them from it long dure
the whole of the journei from elizabeth thought it wa never absent
fix there by the keenest of all anguish selfreproach she could
find no interv of eas or forget
thei travel as expediti as possibl and sleep on night on
the road reach longbourn by dinnertim the next dai it wa a comfort
to elizabeth to consid that jane could not have been weari by long
expect
the littl gardin attract by the sight of a chais were stand
on the step of the hous as thei enter the paddock and when the
carriag drove up to the door the joy surpris that light up their
face and displai itself over their whole bodi in a varieti of
caper and frisk wa the first pleas earnest of their welcom
elizabeth jump out and after give each of them a hasti kiss
hurri into the vestibul where jane who came run downstair from
her mother apart immedi met her
elizabeth as she affection embrac her whilst tear fill the
ey of both lost not a moment in ask whether anyth had been
heard of the fugit
not yet repli jane but now that my dear uncl is come i hope
everyth will be well
is my father in town
ye he went on tuesdai as i wrote you word
and have you heard from him often
we have heard onli onc he wrote me a few line on wednesdai to sai
that he had arriv in safeti and to give me hi direct which i
particularli beg him to do he mere ad that he should not write
again till he had someth of import to mention
and my motherhow is she how ar you all
my mother is toler well i trust though her spirit ar greatli
shaken she is upstair and will have great satisfact in see you
all she doe not yet leav her dressingroom mari and kitti thank
heaven ar quit well
but youhow ar you cri elizabeth you look pale how much you
must have gone through
her sister howev assur her of her be perfectli well and their
convers which had been pass while mr and mr gardin were
engag with their children wa now put an end to by the approach of
the whole parti jane ran to her uncl and aunt and welcom and
thank them both with altern smile and tear
when thei were all in the drawingroom the question which elizabeth
had alreadi ask were of cours repeat by the other and thei soon
found that jane had no intellig to give the sanguin hope of good
howev which the benevol of her heart suggest had not yet
desert her she still expect that it would all end well and that
everi morn would bring some letter either from lydia or her father
to explain their proceed and perhap announc the marriag
mr bennet to whose apart thei all repair after a few minut
convers togeth receiv them exactli as might be expect with
tear and lament of regret invect against the villain
conduct of wickham and complaint of her own suffer and illusag
blame everybodi but the person to whose illjudg indulg the
error of her daughter must be princip ow
if i had been abl said she to carri my point in go to brighton
with all my famili thi would not have happen but poor dear lydia
had nobodi to take care of her why did the forster ever let her go out
of their sight i am sure there wa some great neglect or other on their
side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had
been well look after i alwai thought thei were veri unfit to have
the charg of her but i wa overrul as i alwai am poor dear
child and now here mr bennet gone awai and i know he will fight
wickham wherev he meet him and then he will be kill and what is
to becom of us all the collins will turn us out befor he is cold
in hi grave and if you ar not kind to us brother i do not know what
we shall do
thei all exclaim against such terrif idea and mr gardin after
gener assur of hi affect for her and all her famili told her
that he meant to be in london the veri next dai and would assist mr
bennet in everi endeavour for recov lydia
do not give wai to useless alarm ad he though it is right to be
prepar for the worst there is no occas to look on it as certain
it is not quit a week sinc thei left brighton in a few dai more we
mai gain some new of them and till we know that thei ar not marri
and have no design of marri do not let us give the matter over as
lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him
come home with me to gracechurch street and then we mai consult
togeth as to what is to be done
oh my dear brother repli mr bennet that is exactli what i
could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out
wherev thei mai be and if thei ar not marri alreadi make them
marri and as for wed cloth do not let them wait for that but
tell lydia she shall have as much monei as she choos to bui them
after thei ar marri and abov all thing keep mr bennet from
fight tell him what a dread state i am inthat i am frighten
out of my wit and have such trembl such flutter all over me
such spasm in my side and pain in my head and such beat at my
heart that i can get no rest by night nor by dai and tell my dear
lydia not to give ani direct about her cloth till she ha seen me
for she doe not know which ar the best warehous oh brother how
kind you ar i know you will contriv it all
but mr gardin though he assur her again of hi earnest endeavour
in the caus could not avoid recommend moder to her as well in
her hope as her fear and after talk with her in thi manner till
dinner wa on tabl thei left her to vent all her feel on the
housekeep who attend in the absenc of her daughter
though her brother and sister were persuad that there wa no real
occas for such a seclus from the famili thei did not attempt to
oppos it for thei knew that she had not prudenc enough to hold her
tongu befor the servant while thei wait at tabl and judg it
better that on onli of the household and the on whom thei could
most trust should comprehend all her fear and solicitud on the
subject
in the diningroom thei were soon join by mari and kitti who had been
too busili engag in their separ apart to make their appear
befor on came from her book and the other from her toilett the
face of both howev were toler calm and no chang wa visibl
in either except that the loss of her favourit sister or the anger
which she had herself incur in the busi had given someth more
of fret than usual to the accent of kitti as for mari she wa
mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a counten
of grave reflect soon after thei were seat at tabl
thi is a most unfortun affair and will probabl be much talk of
but we must stem the tide of malic and pour into the wound bosom of
each other the balm of sisterli consol
then perceiv in elizabeth no inclin of repli she ad
unhappi as the event must be for lydia we mai draw from it thi us
lessonthat loss of virtu in a femal is irretriev that on
fals step involv her in endless ruin that her reput is no less
brittl than it is beauti and that she cannot be too much guard in
her behaviour toward the undeserv of the other sex
elizabeth lift up her ey in amaz but wa too much oppress to
make ani repli mari howev continu to consol herself with such
kind of moral extract from the evil befor them
in the afternoon the two elder miss bennet were abl to be for half an
hour by themselv and elizabeth instantli avail herself of the
opportun of make ani inquiri which jane wa equal eager to
satisfi after join in gener lament over the dread sequel
of thi event which elizabeth consid as all but certain and miss
bennet could not assert to be wholli imposs the former continu
the subject by sai but tell me all and everyth about it which i
have not alreadi heard give me further particular what did colonel
forster sai had thei no apprehens of anyth befor the elop
took place thei must have seen them togeth for ever
colonel forster did own that he had often suspect some partial
especi on lydia side but noth to give him ani alarm i am so
griev for him hi behaviour wa attent and kind to the utmost he
wa come to us in order to assur us of hi concern befor he had
ani idea of their not be gone to scotland when that apprehens
first got abroad it hasten hi journei
and wa denni convinc that wickham would not marri did he know of
their intend to go off had colonel forster seen denni himself
ye but when question by him denni deni know anyth of
their plan and would not give hi real opinion about it he did not
repeat hi persuas of their not marri and from that i am
inclin to hope he might have been misunderstood befor
and till colonel forster came himself not on of you entertain a
doubt i suppos of their be realli marri
how wa it possibl that such an idea should enter our brain i felt a
littl uneasya littl fear of my sister happi with him in
marriag becaus i knew that hi conduct had not been alwai quit
right my father and mother knew noth of that thei onli felt how
imprud a match it must be kitti then own with a veri natur
triumph on know more than the rest of us that in lydia last letter
she had prepar her for such a step she had known it seem of their
be in love with each other mani week
but not befor thei went to brighton
no i believ not
and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself doe he
know hi real charact
i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerli
did he believ him to be imprud and extravag and sinc thi sad
affair ha taken place it is said that he left meryton greatli in debt
but i hope thi mai be fals
oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him
thi could not have happen
perhap it would have been better repli her sister
but to expos the former fault of ani person without know what
their present feel were seem unjustifi
we act with the best intent
could colonel forster repeat the particular of lydia note to hi
wife
he brought it with him for us to see
jane then took it from her pocketbook and gave it to elizabeth these
were the content
nind my dear harriet
you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help
laugh myself at your surpris tomorrow morn as soon as i am
miss i am go to gretna green and if you cannot guess with
who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but on man in the
world i love and he is an angel i should never be happi without

longbourn of my go if you do not like it for it will make the
surpris the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia

laugh prai make my excus to pratt for not keep my
engag and danc with him tonight tell him i hope he will
excus me when he know all and tell him i will danc with him at
the next ball we meet with great pleasur i shall send for my

at least it show that she wa seriou in the object of her journei
whatev he might afterward persuad her to it wa not on her side a

i never saw anyon so shock he could not speak a word for full ten

oh jane cri elizabeth wa there a servant belong to it who
did not know the whole stori befor the end of the dai

veri difficult my mother wa in hyster and though i endeavour to
give her everi assist in my power i am afraid i did not do so much

almost took from me my faculti
your attend upon her ha been too much for you you do not look
well oh that i had been with you you have had everi care and anxieti
upon yourself alon
mari and kitti have been veri kind and would have share in everi

meant well but under such a misfortun as thi on cannot see too
littl of on neighbour assist is imposs condol
insuffer let them triumph over us at a distanc and be satisfi
she then proceed to inquir into the measur which her father had
intend to pursu while in town for the recoveri of hi daughter
he meant i believ repli jane to go to epsom the place where
thei last chang hors see the postilion and try if anyth could
be made out from them hi princip object must be to discov the
number of the hacknei coach which took them from clapham it had come

the whole parti were in hope of a letter from mr bennet the next

dilatori correspond but at such a time thei had hope for exert
thei were forc to conclud that he had no pleas intellig to

gardin had wait onli for the letter befor he set off
when he wa gone thei were certain at least of receiv constant
inform of what wa go on and their uncl promis at part
to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to

mr gardin and the children were to remain in hertfordshir a few
dai longer as the former thought her presenc might be servic to
her niec she share in their attend on mr bennet and wa a
great comfort to them in their hour of freedom their other aunt also
visit them frequent and alwai as she said with the design of
cheer and hearten them upthough as she never came without
report some fresh instanc of wickham extravag or irregular
she seldom went awai without leav them more dispirit than she found
them
all meryton seem strive to blacken the man who but three month
befor had been almost an angel of light he wa declar to be in debt

everybodi declar that he wa the wickedest young man in the world and
everybodi began to find out that thei had alwai distrust the

half of what wa said believ enough to make her former assur of

less of it becam almost hopeless more especi as the time wa now
come when if thei had gone to scotland which she had never befor

mr gardin left longbourn on sundai on tuesdai hi wife receiv a

did not expect ani success from thi measur but as hi brother wa
eager in it he meant to assist him in pursu it he ad that mr

i have written to colonel forster to desir him to find out if
possibl from some of the young man intim in the regiment

elizabeth wa at no loss to understand from whenc thi defer for

she had never heard of hi have had ani relat except a father

my dear sir to consol yourself as much as possibl to throw off

mr gardin did not write again till he had receiv an answer from
colonel forster and then he had noth of a pleasant natur to send
it wa not known that wickham had a singl relat with whom he kept up
ani connect and it wa certain that he had no near on live hi
former acquaint had been numer but sinc he had been in the
militia it did not appear that he wa on term of particular friendship
with ani of them there wa no on therefor who could be point out
as like to give ani new of him and in the wretch state of hi own
financ there wa a veri power motiv for secreci in addit to
hi fear of discoveri by lydia relat for it had just transpir
that he had left game debt behind him to a veri consider amount
colonel forster believ that more than a thousand pound would be
necessari to clear hi expens at brighton he ow a good deal in the
town but hi debt of honour were still more formid mr gardin
did not attempt to conceal these particular from the longbourn famili
jane heard them with horror a gamest she cri thi is wholli
unexpect i had not an idea of it
mr gardin ad in hi letter that thei might expect to see their
father at home on the follow dai which wa saturdai render
spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavour he had yield to
hi brotherinlaw entreati that he would return to hi famili and
leav it to him to do whatev occas might suggest to be advis
for continu their pursuit when mr bennet wa told of thi she did
not express so much satisfact as her children expect consid
what her anxieti for hi life had been befor
what is he come home and without poor lydia she cri sure he
will not leav london befor he ha found them who is to fight wickham
and make him marri her if he come awai
as mr gardin began to wish to be at home it wa settl that she
and her children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet
came from it the coach therefor took them the first stage of their
journei and brought it master back to longbourn
mr gardin went awai in all the perplex about elizabeth and her
derbyshir friend that had attend her from that part of the world
hi name had never been voluntarili mention befor them by her niec
and the kind of halfexpect which mr gardin had form of
their be follow by a letter from him had end in noth
elizabeth had receiv none sinc her return that could come from
pemberlei
the present unhappi state of the famili render ani other excus for
the low of her spirit unnecessari noth therefor could be
fairli conjectur from thatthough elizabeth who wa by thi time
toler well acquaint with her own feel wa perfectli awar
that had she known noth of darci she could have born the dread of
lydia infami somewhat better it would have spare her she thought
on sleepless night out of two
when mr bennet arriv he had all the appear of hi usual
philosoph composur he said as littl as he had ever been in the
habit of sai made no mention of the busi that had taken him
awai and it wa some time befor hi daughter had courag to speak of
it
it wa not till the afternoon when he join them at tea that
elizabeth ventur to introduc the subject and then on her briefli
express her sorrow for what he must have endur he repli sai
noth of that who should suffer but myself it ha been my own do
and i ought to feel it
you must not be too sever upon yourself repli elizabeth
you mai well warn me against such an evil human natur is so prone to
fall into it no lizzi let me onc in my life feel how much i have
been to blame i am not afraid of be overpow by the impress
it will pass awai soon enough
do you suppos them to be in london
ye where els can thei be so well conceal
and lydia us to want to go to london ad kitti
she is happi then said her father drili and her resid there
will probabl be of some durat
then after a short silenc he continu lizzi i bear you no
illwil for be justifi in your advic to me last mai which
consid the event show some great of mind
thei were interrupt by miss bennet who came to fetch her mother
tea
thi is a parad cri he which doe on good it give such an

you go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as eastbourn

possibl that he will marri her
wickham is not so undeserv then as we have thought him said her
sister my dear father i congratul you
and have you answer the letter said elizabeth
no but it must be done soon
most earnestli did she then entreat him to lose no more time befor he
wrote
oh my dear father she cri come back and write immedi
consid how import everi moment is in such a case
let me write for you said jane if you dislik the troubl
yourself
i dislik it veri much he repli but it must be done
and so sai he turn back with them and walk toward the hous
andmai i ask said elizabeth but the term i suppos must be
compli with
compli with i am onli asham of hi ask so littl
and thei must marri yet he is such a man
ye ye thei must marri there is noth els to be done but there
ar two thing that i want veri much to knowon is how much monei
your uncl ha laid down to bring it about and the other how i am ever
to pai him
monei my uncl cri jane what do you mean sir
i mean that no man in hi proper sens would marri lydia on so slight
a temptat as on hundr a year dure my life and fifti after i am
gone
that is veri true said elizabeth though it had not occur to me
befor hi debt to be discharg and someth still to remain oh
it must be my uncl do gener good man i am afraid he ha
distress himself a small sum could not do all thi
no said her father wickham a fool if he take her with a farth
less than ten thousand pound i should be sorri to think so ill of him
in the veri begin of our relationship
ten thousand pound heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be
repaid
mr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continu
silent till thei reach the hous their father then went to the
librari to write and the girl walk into the breakfastroom
and thei ar realli to be marri cri elizabeth as soon as thei
were by themselv how strang thi is and for thi we ar to be
thank that thei should marri small as is their chanc of happi
and wretch as is hi charact we ar forc to rejoic oh lydia
i comfort myself with think repli jane that he certainli would
not marri lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind
uncl ha done someth toward clear him i cannot believ that ten
thousand pound or anyth like it ha been advanc he ha children
of hi own and mai have more how could he spare half ten thousand
pound
if we ar ever abl to learn what wickham debt have been said
elizabeth and how much is settl on hi side on our sister we shall
exactli know what mr gardin ha done for them becaus wickham ha
not sixpenc of hi own the kind of my uncl and aunt can never be
requit their take her home and afford her their person
protect and counten is such a sacrific to her advantag as
year of gratitud cannot enough acknowledg by thi time she is
actual with them if such good doe not make her miser now
she will never deserv to be happi what a meet for her when she
first see my aunt
we must endeavour to forget all that ha pass on either side said
jane i hope and trust thei will yet be happi hi consent to marri
her is a proof i will believ that he is come to a right wai of
think their mutual affect will steadi them and i flatter myself
thei will settl so quietli and live in so ration a manner as mai in
time make their past imprud forgotten
their conduct ha been such repli elizabeth as neither you nor
i nor anybodi can ever forget it is useless to talk of it
it now occur to the girl that their mother wa in all likelihood
perfectli ignor of what had happen thei went to the librari
therefor and ask their father whether he would not wish them to make
it known to her he wa write and without rais hi head coolli
repli
just as you pleas
mai we take my uncl letter to read to her
take whatev you like and get awai
elizabeth took the letter from hi writingt and thei went upstair
togeth mari and kitti were both with mr bennet on commun
would therefor do for all after a slight prepar for good new
the letter wa read aloud mr bennet could hardli contain herself as
soon as jane had read mr gardin hope of lydia be soon marri
her joi burst forth and everi follow sentenc ad to it
exuber she wa now in an irrit as violent from delight as she
had ever been fidgeti from alarm and vexat to know that her daughter
would be marri wa enough she wa disturb by no fear for her
felic nor humbl by ani remembr of her misconduct
my dear dear lydia she cri thi is delight inde she will
be marri i shall see her again she will be marri at sixteen my
good kind brother i knew how it would bei knew he would manag
everyth how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the

them directli lizzi my dear run down to your father and ask him how
much he will give her stai stai i will go myself ring the bell
kitti for hill i will put on my thing in a moment my dear dear
lydia how merri we shall be togeth when we meet
her eldest daughter endeavour to give some relief to the violenc of
these transport by lead her thought to the oblig which mr
gardin behaviour laid them all under
for we must attribut thi happi conclus she ad in a great
measur to hi kind we ar persuad that he ha pledg himself to
assist mr wickham with monei
well cri her mother it is all veri right who should do it but
her own uncl if he had not had a famili of hi own i and my children
must have had all hi monei you know and it is the first time we have
ever had anyth from him except a few present well i am so happi
in a short time i shall have a daughter marri mr wickham how well
it sound and she wa onli sixteen last june my dear jane i am in
such a flutter that i am sure i cant write so i will dictat and you
write for me we will settl with your father about the monei
afterward but the thing should be order immedi
she wa then proceed to all the particular of calico muslin and
cambric and would shortli have dictat some veri plenti order had
not jane though with some difficulti persuad her to wait till her
father wa at leisur to be consult on dai delai she observ
would be of small import and her mother wa too happi to be quit
so obstin as usual other scheme too came into her head
i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dress and tell the
good good new to my sister philip and as i come back i can call on
ladi luca and mr long kitti run down and order the carriag an

all have a bowl of punch to make merri at her wed
mr hill began instantli to express her joi elizabeth receiv her
congratul amongst the rest and then sick of thi folli took
refug in her own room that she might think with freedom poor lydia
situat must at best be bad enough but that it wa no wors she
had need to be thank she felt it so and though in look forward
neither ration happi nor worldli prosper could be justli

mr bennet had veri often wish befor thi period of hi life that
instead of spend hi whole incom he had laid by an annual sum for
the better provis of hi children and of hi wife if she surviv
him he now wish it more than ever had he done hi duti in that
respect lydia need not have been indebt to her uncl for whatev of
honour or credit could now be purchas for her the satisfact of
prevail on on of the most worthless young men in great britain to
be her husband might then have rest in it proper place
he wa serious concern that a caus of so littl advantag to anyon
should be forward at the sole expens of hi brotherinlaw and he
wa determin if possibl to find out the extent of hi assist
and to discharg the oblig as soon as he could
when first mr bennet had marri economi wa held to be perfectli
useless for of cours thei were to have a son thi son wa to join
in cut off the entail as soon as he should be of ag and the widow
and younger children would by that mean be provid for five daughter
success enter the world but yet the son wa to come and mr
bennet for mani year after lydia birth had been certain that he
would thi event had at last been despair of but it wa then too
late to be save mr bennet had no turn for economi and her
husband love of independ had alon prevent their exceed their
incom
five thousand pound wa settl by marriag articl on mr bennet and
the children but in what proport it should be divid amongst the
latter depend on the will of the parent thi wa on point with
regard to lydia at least which wa now to be settl and mr bennet
could have no hesit in acced to the propos befor him in
term of grate acknowledg for the kind of hi brother though
express most concis he then deliv on paper hi perfect
approb of all that wa done and hi willing to fulfil the
engag that had been made for him he had never befor suppos
that could wickham be prevail on to marri hi daughter it would be
done with so littl inconveni to himself as by the present
arrang he would scarc be ten pound a year the loser by the
hundr that wa to be paid them for what with her board and pocket
allow and the continu present in monei which pass to her
through her mother hand lydia expens had been veri littl within
that sum
that it would be done with such trifl exert on hi side too wa
anoth veri welcom surpris for hi chief wish at present wa to have
as littl troubl in the busi as possibl when the first transport
of rage which had produc hi activ in seek her were over he
natur return to all hi former indol hi letter wa soon
despatch for though dilatori in undertak busi he wa quick in
it execut he beg to know further particular of what he wa
indebt to hi brother but wa too angri with lydia to send ani
messag to her
the good new quickli spread through the hous and with proportion
speed through the neighbourhood it wa born in the latter with decent
philosophi to be sure it would have been more for the advantag of
convers had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the
happiest altern been seclud from the world in some distant
farmhous but there wa much to be talk of in marri her and the
goodnatur wish for her welldo which had proceed befor from
all the spite old ladi in meryton lost but littl of their spirit
in thi chang of circumst becaus with such a husband her miseri
wa consid certain
it wa a fortnight sinc mr bennet had been down stair but on thi
happi dai she again took her seat at the head of her tabl and in
spirit oppress high no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph the marriag of a daughter which had been the first object of
her wish sinc jane wa sixteen wa now on the point of
accomplish and her thought and her word ran wholli on those
attend of eleg nuptial fine muslin new carriag and
servant she wa busili search through the neighbourhood for a
proper situat for her daughter and without know or consid
what their incom might be reject mani as defici in size and
import
hay park might do said she if the gould would quit it or the
great hous at stoke if the drawingroom were larger but ashworth is
too far off i could not bear to have her ten mile from me and as for
purvi lodg the attic ar dread
her husband allow her to talk on without interrupt while the
servant remain but when thei had withdrawn he said to her mr
bennet befor you take ani or all of these hous for your son and
daughter let us come to a right understand into on hous in thi
neighbourhood thei shall never have admitt i will not encourag the
imprud of either by receiv them at longbourn
a long disput follow thi declar but mr bennet wa firm it
soon led to anoth and mr bennet found with amaz and horror
that her husband would not advanc a guinea to bui cloth for hi
daughter he protest that she should receiv from him no mark of
affect whatev on the occas mr bennet could hardli comprehend
it that hi anger could be carri to such a point of inconceiv
resent as to refus hi daughter a privileg without which her
marriag would scarc seem valid exceed all that she could believ
possibl she wa more aliv to the disgrac which her want of new
cloth must reflect on her daughter nuptial than to ani sens of
shame at her elop and live with wickham a fortnight befor thei
took place
elizabeth wa now most heartili sorri that she had from the distress of
the moment been led to make mr darci acquaint with their fear for
her sister for sinc her marriag would so shortli give the proper
termin to the elop thei might hope to conceal it
unfavour begin from all those who were not immedi on the
spot
she had no fear of it spread farther through hi mean there were
few peopl on whose secreci she would have more confid depend
but at the same time there wa no on whose knowledg of a sister
frailti would have mortifi her so much not howev from ani fear of
disadvantag from it individu to herself for at ani rate there
seem a gulf impass between them had lydia marriag been
conclud on the most honour term it wa not to be suppos that
mr darci would connect himself with a famili where to everi other
object would now be ad an allianc and relationship of the nearest
kind with the man whom he so justli scorn
from such a connect she could not wonder that he should shrink the
wish of procur her regard which she had assur herself of hi
feel in derbyshir could not in ration expect surviv such a
blow as thi she wa humbl she wa griev she repent though she
hardli knew of what she becam jealou of hi esteem when she could no
longer hope to be benefit by it she want to hear of him when there
seem the least chanc of gain intellig she wa convinc that
she could have been happi with him when it wa no longer like thei
should meet
what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the
propos which she had proudli spurn onli four month ago would now
have been gladli and gratefulli receiv he wa as gener she
doubt not as the most gener of hi sex but while he wa mortal
there must be a triumph
she began now to comprehend that he wa exactli the man who in
disposit and talent would most suit her hi understand and
temper though unlik her own would have answer all her wish it
wa an union that must have been to the advantag of both by her eas
and liveli hi mind might have been soften hi manner improv
and from hi judgment inform and knowledg of the world she must
have receiv benefit of greater import
but no such happi marriag could now teach the admir multitud what
connubi felic realli wa an union of a differ tendenc and
preclud the possibl of the other wa soon to be form in their
famili
how wickham and lydia were to be support in toler independ she
could not imagin but how littl of perman happi could belong to
a coupl who were onli brought togeth becaus their passion were
stronger than their virtu she could easili conjectur
mr gardin soon wrote again to hi brother to mr bennet
acknowledg he briefli repli with assur of hi eager to
promot the welfar of ani of hi famili and conclud with entreati
that the subject might never be mention to him again the princip
purport of hi letter wa to inform them that mr wickham had resolv
on quit the militia
it wa greatli my wish that he should do so he ad as soon as hi
marriag wa fix on and i think you will agre with me in
consid a remov from that corp as highli advis both on hi
account and my niec it is mr wickham intent to go into the
regular and among hi former friend there ar still some who ar
abl and will to assist him in the armi he ha the promis of an
ensignci in gener regiment now quarter in the north it is
an advantag to have it so far from thi part of the kingdom he
promis fairli and i hope among differ peopl where thei mai each
have a charact to preserv thei will both be more prudent i have
written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrang
and to request that he will satisfi the variou creditor of mr wickham
in and near brighton with assur of speedi payment for which i have
pledg myself and will you give yourself the troubl of carri
similar assur to hi creditor in meryton of whom i shall subjoin
a list accord to hi inform he ha given in all hi debt i
hope at least he ha not deceiv us haggerston ha our direct and
all will be complet in a week thei will then join hi regiment
unless thei ar first invit to longbourn and i understand from mr
gardin that my niec is veri desir of see you all befor she
leav the south she is well and beg to be dutifulli rememb to
you and her motheryour etc
e gardin
mr bennet and hi daughter saw all the advantag of wickham
remov from the shire as clearli as mr gardin could do but
mr bennet wa not so well pleas with it lydia be settl in
the north just when she had expect most pleasur and pride in her
compani for she had by no mean given up her plan of their resid in
hertfordshir wa a sever disappoint and besid it wa such a
piti that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she wa acquaint
with everybodi and had so mani favourit
she is so fond of mr forster said she it will be quit shock
to send her awai and there ar sever of the young men too that she
like veri much the offic mai not be so pleasant in gener
regiment
hi daughter request for such it might be consid of be
admit into her famili again befor she set off for the north
receiv at first an absolut neg but jane and elizabeth who
agre in wish for the sake of their sister feel and
consequ that she should be notic on her marriag by her parent
urg him so earnestli yet so ration and so mildli to receiv her
and her husband at longbourn as soon as thei were marri that he wa
prevail on to think as thei thought and act as thei wish and their
mother had the satisfact of know that she should be abl to show
her marri daughter in the neighbourhood befor she wa banish to
the north when mr bennet wrote again to hi brother therefor he
sent hi permiss for them to come and it wa settl that as soon
as the ceremoni wa over thei should proce to longbourn elizabeth
wa surpris howev that wickham should consent to such a scheme
and had she consult onli her own inclin ani meet with him
would have been the last object of her wish

gave lydia the feel which would have attend herself had she
been the culprit and wa wretch in the thought of what her sister
must endur
thei came the famili were assembl in the breakfastroom to receiv

she ran into the room her mother step forward embrac her and
welcom her with raptur gave her hand with an affection smile to
wickham who follow hi ladi and wish them both joi with an
alacr which show no doubt of their happi
their recept from mr bennet to whom thei then turn wa not quit
so cordial hi counten rather gain in auster and he scarc
open hi lip the easi assur of the young coupl inde wa
enough to provok him
elizabeth wa disgust and even miss bennet wa shock lydia wa
lydia still untam unabash wild noisi and fearless she turn
from sister to sister demand their congratul and when at
length thei all sat down look eagerli round the room took notic of
some littl alter in it and observ with a laugh that it wa a
great while sinc she had been there
wickham wa not at all more distress than herself but hi manner
were alwai so pleas that had hi charact and hi marriag been
exactli what thei ought hi smile and hi easi address while he
claim their relationship would have delight them all elizabeth
had not befor believ him quit equal to such assur but she sat
down resolv within herself to draw no limit in futur to the
impud of an impud man she blush and jane blush but the
cheek of the two who caus their confus suffer no variat of
colour
there wa no want of discours the bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough and wickham who happen to sit near
elizabeth began inquir after hi acquaint in that neighbourhood
with a goodhumour eas which she felt veri unabl to equal in her
repli thei seem each of them to have the happiest memori in the
world noth of the past wa recollect with pain and lydia led
voluntarili to subject which her sister would not have allud to for
the world
onli think of it be three month she cri sinc i went awai
it seem but a fortnight i declar and yet there have been thing
enough happen in the time good graciou when i went awai i am sure
i had no more idea of be marri till i came back again though i
thought it would be veri good fun if i wa
her father lift up hi ey jane wa distress elizabeth look
express at lydia but she who never heard nor saw anyth of
which she chose to be insens gaili continu
oh mamma do the peopl hereabout know i am marri todai i wa
afraid thei might not and we overtook william gould in hi curricl
so i wa determin he should know it and so i let down the side glass
next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the
window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bow and
smile like anyth
elizabeth could bear it no longer she got up and ran out of the room
and return no more till she heard them pass through the hall to
the diningparlour she then join them soon enough to see lydia with
anxiou parad walk up to her mother right hand and hear her sai to
her eldest sister
ah jane i take your place now and you must go lower becaus i am a
marri woman
it wa not to be suppos that time would give lydia that embarrass
from which she had been so wholli free at first her eas and good
spirit increas she long to see mr philip the lucas and all
their other neighbour and to hear herself call mr wickham by
each of them and in the meantim she went after dinner to show her ring
and boast of be marri to mr hill and the two housemaid
well mamma said she when thei were all return to the
breakfastroom and what do you think of my husband is not he a
charm man i am sure my sister must all envi me i onli hope thei
mai have half my good luck thei must all go to brighton that is the
place to get husband what a piti it is mamma we did not all go
veri true and if i had my will we should but my dear lydia i dont
at all like your go such a wai off must it be so

i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not
particularli like your wai of get husband
their visitor were not to remain abov ten dai with them mr wickham
had receiv hi commiss befor he left london and he wa to join
hi regiment at the end of a fortnight
no on but mr bennet regret that their stai would be so short and
she made the most of the time by visit about with her daughter and
have veri frequent parti at home these parti were accept to
all to avoid a famili circl wa even more desir to such as did
think than such as did not
wickham affect for lydia wa just what elizabeth had expect to
find it not equal to lydia for him she had scarc need her
present observ to be satisfi from the reason of thing that
their elop had been brought on by the strength of her love rather
than by hi and she would have wonder why without violent care
for her he chose to elop with her at all had she not felt certain
that hi flight wa render necessari by distress of circumst and
if that were the case he wa not the young man to resist an opportun
of have a companion
lydia wa exceedingli fond of him he wa her dear wickham on everi
occas no on wa to be put in competit with him he did
everyth best in the world and she wa sure he would kill more bird
on the first of septemb than anybodi els in the countri
on morn soon after their arriv as she wa sit with her two
elder sister she said to elizabeth
lizzi i never gave you an account of my wed i believ you were
not by when i told mamma and the other all about it ar not you
curiou to hear how it wa manag
no realli repli elizabeth i think there cannot be too littl
said on the subject
la you ar so strang but i must tell you how it went off we were
marri you know at st clement becaus wickham lodg were in
that parish and it wa settl that we should all be there by eleven
oclock my uncl and aunt and i were to go togeth and the other
were to meet us at the church
well mondai morn came and i wa in such a fuss i wa so afraid
you know that someth would happen to put it off and then i should
have gone quit distract and there wa my aunt all the time i wa
dress preach and talk awai just as if she wa read a
sermon howev i did not hear abov on word in ten for i wa
think you mai suppos of my dear wickham i long to know whether
he would be marri in hi blue coat
well and so we breakfast at ten as usual i thought it would never
be over for by the bye you ar to understand that my uncl and aunt
were horrid unpleas all the time i wa with them if youll believ
me i did not onc put my foot out of door though i wa there a
fortnight not on parti or scheme or anyth to be sure london wa
rather thin but howev the littl theatr wa open
well and so just as the carriag came to the door my uncl wa
call awai upon busi to that horrid man mr stone and then you
know when onc thei get togeth there is no end of it well i wa so
frighten i did not know what to do for my uncl wa to give me awai
and if we were beyond the hour we could not be marri all dai but
luckili he came back again in ten minut time and then we all set
out howev i recollect afterward that if he had been prevent
go the wed need not be put off for mr darci might have done as
well
mr darci repeat elizabeth in utter amaz
oh ye he wa to come there with wickham you know but graciou me
i quit forgot i ought not to have said a word about it i promis
them so faithfulli what will wickham sai it wa to be such a secret
if it wa to be a secret said jane sai not anoth word on the
subject you mai depend upon my seek no further
oh certainli said elizabeth though burn with curios we will
ask you no question
thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainli tell you
all and then wickham would be so angri
on such encourag to ask elizabeth wa forc to put it out of her
power by run awai

my dear niec
i have just receiv your letter and shall devot thi whole
morn to answer it as i forese that a littl write will
not compris what i have to tell you i must confess myself
surpris by your applic i did not expect it from you
dont think me angri howev for i onli mean to let you know
that i had not imagin such inquiri to be necessari on your
side if you do not choos to understand me forgiv my
impertin your uncl is as much surpris as i am and noth
but the belief of your be a parti concern would have allow
him to act as he ha done but if you ar realli innoc and
ignor i must be more explicit on the veri dai of my come
home from longbourn your uncl had a most unexpect visitor mr
darci call and wa shut up with him sever hour it wa all
over befor i arriv so my curios wa not so dreadfulli rack
as your seem to have been he came to tell mr gardin that he
had found out where your sister and mr wickham were and that he
had seen and talk with them bothwickham repeatedli lydia onc
from what i can collect he left derbyshir onli on dai after
ourselv and came to town with the resolut of hunt for
them the motiv profess wa hi convict of it be ow to
himself that wickham worthless had not been so well known as
to make it imposs for ani young woman of charact to love or
confid in him he gener imput the whole to hi mistaken
pride and confess that he had befor thought it beneath him to
lai hi privat action open to the world hi charact wa to
speak for itself he call it therefor hi duti to step
forward and endeavour to remedi an evil which had been brought on
by himself if he had anoth motiv i am sure it would never
disgrac him he had been some dai in town befor he wa abl to
discov them but he had someth to direct hi search which wa
more than we had and the conscious of thi wa anoth
reason for hi resolv to follow us there is a ladi it seem a
mr young who wa some time ago gover to miss darci and wa
dismiss from her charg on some caus of disapprob though
he did not sai what she then took a larg hous in edward street
and ha sinc maintain herself by let lodg thi mr
young wa he knew intim acquaint with wickham and he
went to her for intellig of him as soon as he got to town but
it wa two or three dai befor he could get from her what he
want she would not betrai her trust i suppos without briberi
and corrupt for she realli did know where her friend wa to be
found wickham inde had gone to her on their first arriv in
london and had she been abl to receiv them into her hous thei
would have taken up their abod with her at length howev our
kind friend procur the wishedfor direct thei were in
street he saw wickham and afterward insist on see lydia
hi first object with her he acknowledg had been to persuad
her to quit her present disgrac situat and return to her
friend as soon as thei could be prevail on to receiv her
offer hi assist as far as it would go but he found lydia
absolut resolv on remain where she wa she care for none
of her friend she want no help of hi she would not hear of
leav wickham she wa sure thei should be marri some time or
other and it did not much signifi when sinc such were her
feel it onli remain he thought to secur and expedit a
marriag which in hi veri first convers with wickham he
easili learnt had never been hi design he confess himself
oblig to leav the regiment on account of some debt of honour
which were veri press and scrupl not to lai all the ill
consequ of lydia flight on her own folli alon he meant to
resign hi commiss immedi and as to hi futur situat
he could conjectur veri littl about it he must go somewher but
he did not know where and he knew he should have noth to live
on mr darci ask why he did not marri your sister at onc
though mr bennet wa not imagin to be veri rich he would have
been abl to do someth for him and hi situat must have been
benefit by marriag but he found in repli to thi question
that wickham still cherish the hope of more effectu make
hi fortun by marriag in some other countri under such
circumst howev he wa not like to be proof against the
temptat of immedi relief thei met sever time for there
wa much to be discuss wickham of cours want more than he
could get but at length wa reduc to be reason everyth
be settl between them mr darci next step wa to make
your uncl acquaint with it and he first call in gracechurch
street the even befor i came home but mr gardin could not
be seen and mr darci found on further inquiri that your father
wa still with him but would quit town the next morn he did
not judg your father to be a person whom he could so properli
consult as your uncl and therefor readili postpon see him
till after the departur of the former he did not leav hi name
and till the next dai it wa onli known that a gentleman had call
on busi on saturdai he came again your father wa gone your
uncl at home and as i said befor thei had a great deal of talk
togeth thei met again on sundai and then i saw him too it
wa not all settl befor mondai as soon as it wa the express
wa sent off to longbourn but our visitor wa veri obstin i
fanci lizzi that obstinaci is the real defect of hi charact
after all he ha been accus of mani fault at differ time
but thi is the true on noth wa to be done that he did not
do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thank
therefor sai noth about it your uncl would most readili have
settl the whole thei battl it togeth for a long time which
wa more than either the gentleman or ladi concern in it
deserv but at last your uncl wa forc to yield and instead
of be allow to be of us to hi niec wa forc to put up
with onli have the probabl credit of it which went sore
against the grain and i realli believ your letter thi morn
gave him great pleasur becaus it requir an explan that
would rob him of hi borrow feather and give the prais where
it wa due but lizzi thi must go no further than yourself or
jane at most you know pretti well i suppos what ha been done
for the young peopl hi debt ar to be paid amount i
believ to consider more than a thousand pound anoth
thousand in addit to her own settl upon her and hi
commiss purchas the reason why all thi wa to be done by him
alon wa such as i have given abov it wa ow to him to hi
reserv and want of proper consider that wickham charact
had been so misunderstood and consequ that he had been
receiv and notic as he wa perhap there wa some truth in
thi though i doubt whether hi reserv or anybodi
reserv can be answer for the event but in spite of all thi
fine talk my dear lizzi you mai rest perfectli assur that
your uncl would never have yield if we had not given him credit
for anoth interest in the affair when all thi wa resolv
on he return again to hi friend who were still stai at
pemberlei but it wa agre that he should be in london onc more
when the wed took place and all monei matter were then to
receiv the last finish i believ i have now told you everyth
it is a relat which you tell me is to give you great surpris i
hope at least it will not afford you ani displeasur lydia came to
us and wickham had constant admiss to the hous he wa
exactli what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshir but i
would not tell you how littl i wa satisfi with her behaviour
while she stai with us if i had not perceiv by jane letter
last wednesdai that her conduct on come home wa exactli of a
piec with it and therefor what i now tell you can give you no
fresh pain i talk to her repeatedli in the most seriou manner
repres to her the wicked of what she had done and all
the unhappi she had brought on her famili if she heard me it
wa by good luck for i am sure she did not listen i wa sometim
quit provok but then i recollect my dear elizabeth and jane
and for their sake had patienc with her mr darci wa punctual
in hi return and as lydia imform you attend the wed he
dine with us the next dai and wa to leav town again on
wednesdai or thursdai will you be veri angri with me my dear
lizzi if i take thi opportun of sai what i wa never bold
enough to sai befor how much i like him hi behaviour to us ha
in everi respect been as pleas as when we were in derbyshir
hi understand and opinion all pleas me he want noth but
a littl more liveli and that if he marri prudent hi
wife mai teach him i thought him veri sly he hardli ever
mention your name but slyness seem the fashion prai forgiv
me if i have been veri presum or at least do not punish me so
far as to exclud me from p i shall never be quit happi till i
have been all round the park a low phaeton with a nice littl pair
of poni would be the veri thing but i must write no more the

your veri sincer

the content of thi letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirit
in which it wa difficult to determin whether pleasur or pain bore the
greatest share the vagu and unsettl suspicion which uncertainti had
produc of what mr darci might have been do to forward her
sister matchwhich she had fear to encourag as an exert of
good too great to be probabl and at the same time dread to be
just from the pain of obligationwer prove beyond their greatest
extent to be true he had follow them purpos to town he had taken
on himself all the troubl and mortif attend on such a
research in which supplic had been necessari to a woman whom he
must abomin and despis and where he wa reduc to meet frequent
meet reason with persuad and final bribe the man whom he alwai
most wish to avoid and whose veri name it wa punish to him to
pronounc he had done all thi for a girl whom he could neither regard
nor esteem her heart did whisper that he had done it for her but it
wa a hope shortli check by other consider and she soon felt
that even her vaniti wa insuffici when requir to depend on hi
affect for her for a woman who had alreadi refus him as abl to
overcom a sentiment so natur as abhorr against relationship with
wickham brotherinlaw of wickham everi kind of pride must revolt from
the connect he had to be sure done much she wa asham to think
how much but he had given a reason for hi interfer which ask no
extraordinari stretch of belief it wa reason that he should feel
he had been wrong he had liber and he had the mean of exercis
it and though she would not place herself as hi princip induc
she could perhap believ that remain partial for her might
assist hi endeavour in a caus where her peac of mind must be
materi concern it wa pain exceedingli pain to know that
thei were under oblig to a person who could never receiv a
return thei ow the restor of lydia her charact everyth to
him oh how heartili did she griev over everi ungraci sensat she
had ever encourag everi sauci speech she had ever direct toward
him for herself she wa humbl but she wa proud of himproud that
in a caus of compass and honour he had been abl to get the better
of himself she read over her aunt commend of him again and
again it wa hardli enough but it pleas her she wa even sensibl
of some pleasur though mix with regret on find how steadfastli
both she and her uncl had been persuad that affect and confid
subsist between mr darci and herself
she wa rous from her seat and her reflect by someon approach
and befor she could strike into anoth path she wa overtaken by
wickham
i am afraid i interrupt your solitari rambl my dear sister said he

that the interrupt must be unwelcom

mr wickham wa so perfectli satisfi with thi convers that he
never again distress himself or provok hi dear sister elizabeth
by introduc the subject of it and she wa pleas to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet
the dai of hi and lydia departur soon came and mr bennet wa
forc to submit to a separ which as her husband by no mean
enter into her scheme of their all go to newcastl wa like to
continu at least a twelvemonth

the hous as ever i saw he simper and smirk and make love to us
all i am prodigi proud of him i defi even sir william luca
himself to produc a more valuabl soninlaw
the loss of her daughter made mr bennet veri dull for sever dai
i often think said she that there is noth so bad as part with
on friend on seem so forlorn without them
thi is the consequ you see madam of marri a daughter said
elizabeth it must make you better satisfi that your other four ar
singl
it is no such thing lydia doe not leav me becaus she is marri
but onli becaus her husband regiment happen to be so far off if
that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon
but the spiritless condit which thi event threw her into wa shortli
reliev and her mind open again to the agit of hope by an
articl of new which then began to be in circul the housekeep
at netherfield had receiv order to prepar for the arriv of her
master who wa come down in a dai or two to shoot there for sever
week mr bennet wa quit in the fidget she look at jane and
smile and shook her head by turn
well well and so mr binglei is come down sister for mr
philip first brought her the new well so much the better not that
i care about it though he is noth to us you know and i am sure i
never want to see him again but howev he is veri welcom to come to
netherfield if he like it and who know what mai happen but that
is noth to us you know sister we agre long ago never to mention
a word about it and so it is quit certain he is come
you mai depend on it repli the other for mr nichol wa in
meryton last night i saw her pass by and went out myself on purpos
to know the truth of it and she told me that it wa certainli true he
come down on thursdai at the latest veri like on wednesdai she wa
go to the butcher she told me on purpos to order in some meat on
wednesdai and she ha got three coupl of duck just fit to be kill
miss bennet had not been abl to hear of hi come without chang
colour it wa mani month sinc she had mention hi name to
elizabeth but now as soon as thei were alon togeth she said
i saw you look at me todai lizzi when my aunt told us of the present
report and i know i appear distress but dont imagin it wa from
ani silli caus i wa onli confus for the moment becaus i felt that
i should be look at i do assur you that the new doe not affect
me either with pleasur or pain i am glad of on thing that he come
alon becaus we shall see the less of him not that i am afraid of
myself but i dread other peopl remark
elizabeth did not know what to make of it had she not seen him in
derbyshir she might have suppos him capabl of come there with no
other view than what wa acknowledg but she still thought him partial
to jane and she waver as to the greater probabl of hi come
there with hi friend permiss or be bold enough to come
without it
yet it is hard she sometim thought that thi poor man cannot come
to a hous which he ha legal hire without rais all thi
specul i will leav him to himself
in spite of what her sister declar and realli believ to be her
feel in the expect of hi arriv elizabeth could easili
perceiv that her spirit were affect by it thei were more disturb
more unequ than she had often seen them
the subject which had been so warmli canvass between their parent
about a twelvemonth ago wa now brought forward again
as soon as ever mr binglei come my dear said mr bennet you
will wait on him of cours
no no you forc me into visit him last year and promis if i
went to see him he should marri on of my daughter but it end in
noth and i will not be sent on a fool errand again
hi wife repres to him how absolut necessari such an attent
would be from all the neighbour gentlemen on hi return to
netherfield
ti an etiquett i despis said he if he want our societi let
him seek it he know where we live i will not spend my hour in
run after my neighbour everi time thei go awai and come back
again
well all i know is that it will be abomin rude if you do not wait
on him but howev that shant prevent my ask him to dine here i
am determin we must have mr long and the gould soon that will
make thirteen with ourselv so there will be just room at tabl for
him
consol by thi resolut she wa the better abl to bear her
husband incivil though it wa veri mortifi to know that her
neighbour might all see mr binglei in consequ of it befor
thei did as the dai of hi arriv drew near
i begin to be sorri that he come at all said jane to her sister it
would be noth i could see him with perfect indiffer but i can
hardli bear to hear it thu perpetu talk of my mother mean well
but she doe not know no on can know how much i suffer from what she
sai happi shall i be when hi stai at netherfield is over
i wish i could sai anyth to comfort you repli elizabeth but it
is wholli out of my power you must feel it and the usual satisfact
of preach patienc to a suffer is deni me becaus you have
alwai so much
mr binglei arriv mr bennet through the assist of servant
contriv to have the earliest tide of it that the period of anxieti
and fret on her side be as long as it could she count the dai
that must interven befor their invit could be senthopeless of
see him befor but on the third morn after hi arriv in
hertfordshir she saw him from her dressingroom window enter the
paddock and ride toward the hous
her daughter were eagerli call to partak of her joi jane resolut
kept her place at the tabl but elizabeth to satisfi her mother went
to the windowsh lookedsh saw mr darci with him and sat down
again by her sister
there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitti who can it be
some acquaint or other my dear i suppos i am sure i do not
know
la repli kitti it look just like that man that us to be with
him befor mr what hi namethat tall proud man
good graciou mr darcyand so it doe i vow well ani friend of
mr binglei will alwai be welcom here to be sure but els i must
sai that i hate the veri sight of him
jane look at elizabeth with surpris and concern she knew but littl
of their meet in derbyshir and therefor felt for the awkward
which must attend her sister in see him almost for the first time
after receiv hi explanatori letter both sister were uncomfort
enough each felt for the other and of cours for themselv and their
mother talk on of her dislik of mr darci and her resolut to be
civil to him onli as mr binglei friend without be heard by either
of them but elizabeth had sourc of uneasi which could not yet be
suspect by jane to whom she had never yet had courag to show mr
gardin letter or to relat her own chang of sentiment toward
him to jane he could be onli a man whose propos she had refus
and whose merit she had undervalu but to her own more extens
inform he wa the person to whom the whole famili were indebt
for the first of benefit and whom she regard herself with an
interest if not quit so tender at least as reason and just as
what jane felt for binglei her astonish at hi comingat hi
come to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarili seek her again
wa almost equal to what she had known on first wit hi alter
behaviour in derbyshir
the colour which had been driven from her face return for half a
minut with an addit glow and a smile of delight ad lustr to
her ey as she thought for that space of time that hi affect and
wish must still be unshaken but she would not be secur
let me first see how he behav said she it will then be earli
enough for expect
she sat intent at work strive to be compos and without dare to
lift up her ey till anxiou curios carri them to the face of her
sister as the servant wa approach the door jane look a littl
paler than usual but more sedat than elizabeth had expect on the
gentlemen appear her colour increas yet she receiv them with
toler eas and with a proprieti of behaviour equal free from ani
symptom of resent or ani unnecessari complais
elizabeth said as littl to either as civil would allow and sat down
again to her work with an eager which it did not often command she
had ventur onli on glanc at darci he look seriou as usual and
she thought more as he had been us to look in hertfordshir than as
she had seen him at pemberlei but perhap he could not in her
mother presenc be what he wa befor her uncl and aunt it wa a
pain but not an improb conjectur
binglei she had likewis seen for an instant and in that short period
saw him look both pleas and embarrass he wa receiv by mr
bennet with a degre of civil which made her two daughter asham
especi when contrast with the cold and ceremoni polit of
her courtesi and address of hi friend
elizabeth particularli who knew that her mother ow to the latter the
preserv of her favourit daughter from irremedi infami wa
hurt and distress to a most pain degre by a distinct so ill
appli
darci after inquir of her how mr and mr gardin dida question
which she could not answer without confusionsaid scarc anyth he
wa not seat by her perhap that wa the reason of hi silenc but
it had not been so in derbyshir there he had talk to her friend
when he could not to herself but now sever minut elaps without
bring the sound of hi voic and when occasion unabl to resist
the impuls of curios she rais her ey to hi face she as often
found him look at jane as at herself and frequent on no object but
the ground more thought and less anxieti to pleas than when
thei last met were plainli express she wa disappoint and angri
with herself for be so
could i expect it to be otherwis said she yet why did he come
she wa in no humour for convers with anyon but himself and to
him she had hardli courag to speak
she inquir after hi sister but could do no more
it is a long time mr binglei sinc you went awai said mr bennet
he readili agre to it
i began to be afraid you would never come back again peopl did sai
you meant to quit the place entir at michaelma but howev i hope
it is not true a great mani chang have happen in the neighbourhood
sinc you went awai miss luca is marri and settl and on of my
own daughter i suppos you have heard of it inde you must have
seen it in the paper it wa in the time and the courier i know
though it wa not put in as it ought to be it wa onli said late
georg wickham esq to miss lydia bennet without there be a
syllabl said of her father or the place where she live or anyth
it wa my brother gardin draw up too and i wonder how he came
to make such an awkward busi of it did you see it
binglei repli that he did and made hi congratul elizabeth
dare not lift up her ey how mr darci look therefor she could
not tell
it is a delight thing to be sure to have a daughter well marri
continu her mother but at the same time mr binglei it is veri
hard to have her taken awai from me thei ar gone down to newcastl a
place quit northward it seem and there thei ar to stai i do not
know how long hi regiment is there for i suppos you have heard of
hi leav the shire and of hi be gone into the regular
thank heaven he ha some friend though perhap not so mani as he
deserv
elizabeth who knew thi to be level at mr darci wa in such miseri
of shame that she could hardli keep her seat it drew from her howev
the exert of speak which noth els had so effectu done
befor and she ask binglei whether he meant to make ani stai in the
countri at present a few week he believ
when you have kill all your own bird mr binglei said her mother
i beg you will come here and shoot as mani as you pleas on mr
bennet manor i am sure he will be vastli happi to oblig you and
will save all the best of the covei for you
elizabeth miseri increas at such unnecessari such offici
attent were the same fair prospect to aris at present as had
flatter them a year ago everyth she wa persuad would be
hasten to the same vexati conclus at that instant she felt
that year of happi could not make jane or herself amend for
moment of such pain confus
the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be
in compani with either of them their societi can afford no pleasur
that will aton for such wretched as thi let me never see either
on or the other again
yet the miseri for which year of happi were to offer no
compens receiv soon afterward materi relief from observ
how much the beauti of her sister rekindl the admir of her former
lover when first he came in he had spoken to her but littl but everi
five minut seem to be give her more of hi attent he found her
as handsom as she had been last year as goodnatur and as
unaffect though not quit so chatti jane wa anxiou that no
differ should be perceiv in her at all and wa realli persuad
that she talk as much as ever but her mind wa so busili engag
that she did not alwai know when she wa silent
when the gentlemen rose to go awai mr bennet wa mind of her
intend civil and thei were invit and engag to dine at
longbourn in a few dai time
you ar quit a visit in my debt mr binglei she ad for when
you went to town last winter you promis to take a famili dinner with
us as soon as you return i have not forgot you see and i assur you
i wa veri much disappoint that you did not come back and keep your
engag
binglei look a littl silli at thi reflect and said someth of
hi concern at have been prevent by busi thei then went awai
mr bennet had been strongli inclin to ask them to stai and dine
there that dai but though she alwai kept a veri good tabl she did
not think anyth less than two cours could be good enough for a man
on whom she had such anxiou design or satisfi the appetit and pride
of on who had ten thousand a year

or in other word to dwell without interrupt on those subject
which must deaden them more mr darci behaviour astonish and vex
her

did he come at all
she could settl it in no wai that gave her pleasur
he could be still amiabl still pleas to my uncl and aunt when he
wa in town and why not to me if he fear me why come hither if he
no longer care for me why silent teas teas man i will think
no more about him
her resolut wa for a short time involuntarili kept by the approach
of her sister who join her with a cheer look which show her
better satisfi with their visitor than elizabeth
now said she that thi first meet is over i feel perfectli
easi i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrass again by
hi come i am glad he dine here on tuesdai it will then be publicli
seen that on both side we meet onli as common and indiffer
acquaint
ye veri indiffer inde said elizabeth laughingli oh jane
take care
my dear lizzi you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now
i think you ar in veri great danger of make him as much in love with
you as ever
thei did not see the gentlemen again till tuesdai and mr bennet in
the meanwhil wa give wai to all the happi scheme which the
goodhumour and common polit of binglei in half an hour visit
had reviv
on tuesdai there wa a larg parti assembl at longbourn and the two
who were most anxious expect to the credit of their punctual as
sportsmen were in veri good time when thei repair to the
diningroom elizabeth eagerli watch to see whether binglei would take
the place which in all their former parti had belong to him by
her sister her prudent mother occupi by the same idea forbor to
invit him to sit by herself on enter the room he seem to
hesit but jane happen to look round and happen to smile it wa
decid he place himself by her
elizabeth with a triumphant sensat look toward hi friend he
bore it with nobl indiffer and she would have imagin that
binglei had receiv hi sanction to be happi had she not seen hi ey
likewis turn toward mr darci with an express of halflaugh
alarm
hi behaviour to her sister wa such dure dinnertim as show an
admir of her which though more guard than formerli persuad
elizabeth that if left wholli to himself jane happi and hi
own would be speedili secur though she dare not depend upon the
consequ she yet receiv pleasur from observ hi behaviour it
gave her all the anim that her spirit could boast for she wa in
no cheer humour mr darci wa almost as far from her as the tabl
could divid them he wa on on side of her mother she knew how littl
such a situat would give pleasur to either or make either appear to
advantag she wa not near enough to hear ani of their discours but
she could see how seldom thei spoke to each other and how formal and
cold wa their manner whenev thei did her mother ungraci
made the sens of what thei ow him more pain to elizabeth mind
and she would at time have given anyth to be privileg to tell
him that hi kind wa neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the famili
she wa in hope that the even would afford some opportun of
bring them togeth that the whole of the visit would not pass awai
without enabl them to enter into someth more of convers
than the mere ceremoni salut attend hi entranc anxiou and
uneasi the period which pass in the drawingroom befor the gentlemen
came wa wearisom and dull to a degre that almost made her uncivil
she look forward to their entranc as the point on which all her
chanc of pleasur for the even must depend
if he doe not come to me then said she i shall give him up for
ever
the gentlemen came and she thought he look as if he would have
answer her hope but ala the ladi had crowd round the tabl
where miss bennet wa make tea and elizabeth pour out the coffe
in so close a confederaci that there wa not a singl vacanc near her
which would admit of a chair and on the gentlemen approach on of
the girl move closer to her than ever and said in a whisper
the men shant come and part us i am determin we want none of them
do we
darci had walk awai to anoth part of the room she follow him with
her ey envi everyon to whom he spoke had scarc patienc enough
to help anybodi to coffe and then wa enrag against herself for
be so silli
a man who ha onc been refus how could i ever be foolish enough to
expect a renew of hi love is there on among the sex who would not
protest against such a weak as a second propos to the same woman
there is no indign so abhorr to their feel
she wa a littl reviv howev by hi bring back hi coffeecup
himself and she seiz the opportun of sai
is your sister at pemberlei still
ye she will remain there till christma
and quit alon have all her friend left her
mr anneslei is with her the other have been gone on to scarborough
these three week
she could think of noth more to sai but if he wish to convers
with her he might have better success he stood by her howev for
some minut in silenc and at last on the young ladi whisper
to elizabeth again he walk awai
when the tea thing were remov and the card tabl place the ladi
all rose and elizabeth wa then hope to be soon join by him when
all her view were overthrown by see him fall a victim to her
mother rapac for whist player and in a few moment after seat
with the rest of the parti she now lost everi expect of pleasur
thei were confin for the even at differ tabl and she had
noth to hope but that hi ey were so often turn toward her side
of the room as to make him plai as unsuccessfulli as herself
mr bennet had design to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to
supper but their carriag wa unluckili order befor ani of the
other and she had no opportun of detain them
well girl said she as soon as thei were left to themselv what
sai you to the dai i think everyth ha pass off uncommonli well i
assur you the dinner wa as well dress as ani i ever saw the
venison wa roast to a turnand everybodi said thei never saw so fat
a haunch the soup wa fifti time better than what we had at the
lucas last week and even mr darci acknowledg that the partridg
were remark well done and i suppos he ha two or three french
cook at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater
beauti mr long said so too for i ask her whether you did not and

mr long and her niec
mr bennet in short wa in veri great spirit she had seen enough of
binglei behaviour to jane to be convinc that she would get him at
last and her expect of advantag to her famili when in a happi
humour were so far beyond reason that she wa quit disappoint at
not see him there again the next dai to make hi propos
it ha been a veri agreeabl dai said miss bennet to elizabeth the
parti seem so well select so suitabl on with the other i hope we
mai often meet again
elizabeth smile
lizzi you must not do so you must not suspect me it mortifi me i
assur you that i have now learnt to enjoi hi convers as an
agreeabl and sensibl young man without have a wish beyond it i am
perfectli satisfi from what hi manner now ar that he never had
ani design of engag my affect it is onli that he is bless with
greater sweet of address and a stronger desir of gener
pleas than ani other man
you ar veri cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and
ar provok me to it everi moment
how hard it is in some case to be believ and how imposs in
other but why should you wish to persuad me that i feel more than i

instruct though we can teach onli what is not worth know forgiv

after thi dai jane said no more of her indiffer not a word pass
between the sister concern binglei but elizabeth went to bed in the
happi belief that all must speedili be conclud unless mr darci

persuad that all thi must have taken place with that gentleman
concurr
binglei wa punctual to hi appoint and he and mr bennet spent the
morn togeth as had been agre on the latter wa much more
agreeabl than hi companion expect there wa noth of presumpt
or folli in binglei that could provok hi ridicul or disgust him into
silenc and he wa more commun and less eccentr than the
other had ever seen him binglei of cours return with him to dinner
and in the even mr bennet invent wa again at work to get
everybodi awai from him and her daughter elizabeth who had a letter to
write went into the breakfastroom for that purpos soon after tea for
as the other were all go to sit down to card she could not be
want to counteract her mother scheme
but on her return to the drawingroom when her letter wa finish
she saw to her infinit surpris there wa reason to fear that her
mother had been too ingeni for her on open the door she
perceiv her sister and binglei stand togeth over the hearth as
if engag in earnest convers and had thi led to no suspicion
the face of both as thei hastili turn round and move awai from each
other would have told it all their situat wa awkward enough but
her she thought wa still wors not a syllabl wa utter by
either and elizabeth wa on the point of go awai again when
binglei who as well as the other had sat down suddenli rose and
whisper a few word to her sister ran out of the room
jane could have no reserv from elizabeth where confid would give
pleasur and instantli embrac her acknowledg with the liveliest
emot that she wa the happiest creatur in the world
ti too much she ad by far too much i do not deserv it oh
why is not everybodi as happi
elizabeth congratul were given with a sincer a warmth a
delight which word could but poorli express everi sentenc of
kind wa a fresh sourc of happi to jane but she would not
allow herself to stai with her sister or sai half that remain to be
said for the present
i must go instantli to my mother she cri i would not on ani
account trifl with her affection solicitud or allow her to hear it
from anyon but myself he is gone to my father alreadi oh lizzi to
know that what i have to relat will give such pleasur to all my dear
famili how shall i bear so much happi
she then hasten awai to her mother who had purpos broken up the
cardparti and wa sit upstair with kitti
elizabeth who wa left by herself now smile at the rapid and eas
with which an affair wa final settl that had given them so mani
previou month of suspens and vexat
and thi said she is the end of all hi friend anxiou
circumspect of all hi sister falsehood and contriv the
happiest wisest and most reason end
in a few minut she wa join by binglei whose confer with her
father had been short and to the purpos
where is your sister said he hastili as he open the door
with my mother upstair she will be down in a moment i dare sai
he then shut the door and come up to her claim the good wish
and affect of a sister elizabeth honestli and heartili express her
delight in the prospect of their relationship thei shook hand with
great cordial and then till her sister came down she had to listen
to all he had to sai of hi own happi and of jane perfect
and in spite of hi be a lover elizabeth realli believ all hi
expect of felic to be ration found becaus thei had for
basi the excel understand and superexcel disposit of
jane and a gener similar of feel and tast between her and
himself
it wa an even of no common delight to them all the satisfact of
miss bennet mind gave such a glow of sweet anim to her face as
made her look handsom than ever kitti simper and smile and hope
her turn wa come soon mr bennet could not give her consent or
speak her approb in term warm enough to satisfi her feel
though she talk to binglei of noth els for half an hour and when
mr bennet join them at supper hi voic and manner plainli show
how realli happi he wa
not a word howev pass hi lip in allus to it till their
visitor took hi leav for the night but as soon as he wa gone he
turn to hi daughter and said

would be i alwai said it must be so at last i wa sure you could not
be so beauti for noth i rememb as soon as ever i saw him when
he first came into hertfordshir last year i thought how like it wa
that you should come togeth oh he is the handsomest young man that
ever wa seen
wickham lydia were all forgotten jane wa beyond competit her
favourit child at that moment she care for no other her younger
sister soon began to make interest with her for object of happi
which she might in futur be abl to dispens
mari petit for the us of the librari at netherfield and kitti
beg veri hard for a few ball there everi winter
binglei from thi time wa of cours a daili visitor at longbourn
come frequent befor breakfast and alwai remain till after
supper unless when some barbar neighbour who could not be enough
detest had given him an invit to dinner which he thought
himself oblig to accept
elizabeth had now but littl time for convers with her sister for
while he wa present jane had no attent to bestow on anyon els but
she found herself consider us to both of them in those hour of
separ that must sometim occur in the absenc of jane he alwai
attach himself to elizabeth for the pleasur of talk of her and
when binglei wa gone jane constantli sought the same mean of relief
he ha made me so happi said she on even by tell me that he
wa total ignor of my be in town last spring i had not believ
it possibl
i suspect as much repli elizabeth but how did he account for
it
it must have been hi sister do thei were certainli no friend to
hi acquaint with me which i cannot wonder at sinc he might have
chosen so much more advantag in mani respect but when thei see
as i trust thei will that their brother is happi with me thei will
learn to be content and we shall be on good term again though we
can never be what we onc were to each other
that is the most unforgiv speech said elizabeth that i ever
heard you utter good girl it would vex me inde to see you again
the dupe of miss binglei pretend regard
would you believ it lizzi that when he went to town last novemb he
realli love me and noth but a persuas of my be indiffer
would have prevent hi come down again
he made a littl mistak to be sure but it is to the credit of hi
modesti
thi natur introduc a panegyr from jane on hi diffid and
the littl valu he put on hi own good qualiti
elizabeth wa pleas to find that he had not betrai the interfer
of hi friend for though jane had the most gener and forgiv
heart in the world she knew it wa a circumst which must prejudic
her against him
i am certainli the most fortun creatur that ever exist cri
jane oh lizzi why am i thu singl from my famili and bless
abov them all if i could but see you as happi if there were but such
anoth man for you
if you were to give me forti such men i never could be so happi as you
till i have your disposit your good i never can have your
happi no no let me shift for myself and perhap if i have veri
good luck i mai meet with anoth mr collin in time
the situat of affair in the longbourn famili could not be long a
secret mr bennet wa privileg to whisper it to mr philip and
she ventur without ani permiss to do the same by all her
neighbour in meryton
the bennet were speedili pronounc to be the luckiest famili in the
world though onli a few week befor when lydia had first run awai
thei had been gener prove to be mark out for misfortun

were post and neither the carriag nor the liveri of the servant who
preced it were familiar to them as it wa certain howev that
somebodi wa come binglei instantli prevail on miss bennet to avoid
the confin of such an intrus and walk awai with him into the

inferior to what elizabeth felt

other repli to elizabeth salut than a slight inclin of the
head and sat down without sai a word elizabeth had mention her
name to her mother on her ladyship entranc though no request of

if i have i shall be the last person to confess it
miss bennet do you know who i am i have not been accustom to such
languag as thi i am almost the nearest relat he ha in the world
and am entitl to know all hi dearest concern
but you ar not entitl to know mine nor will such behaviour as

let me be rightli understood thi match to which you have the
presumpt to aspir can never take place no never mr darci is
engag to my daughter now what have you to sai
onli thisthat if he is so you can have no reason to suppos he will
make an offer to me
ladi catherin hesit for a moment and then repli
the engag between them is of a peculiar kind from their infanc
thei have been intend for each other it wa the favourit wish of
hi mother as well as of her while in their cradl we plan the
union and now at the moment when the wish of both sister would be
accomplish is their marriag to be prevent by a young woman of
inferior birth of no import in the world and wholli unal to

tacit engag with miss de bourgh ar you lost to everi feel of
proprieti and delicaci have you not heard me sai that from hi
earliest hour he wa destin for hi cousin
ye and i had heard it befor but what is that to me if there is no
other object to my marri your nephew i shall certainli not be
kept from it by know that hi mother and aunt wish him to marri
miss de bourgh you both did as much as you could in plan the

that will make your ladyship situat at present more pitiabl
but it will have no effect on me
i will not be interrupt hear me in silenc my daughter and my

honour and ancient though untitl famili their fortun on

how far your nephew might approv of your interfer in hi affair

elizabeth made no answer and without attempt to persuad her
ladyship to return into the hous walk quietli into it herself she
heard the carriag drive awai as she proceed upstair her mother
impati met her at the door of her dressingroom to ask why ladi
catherin would not come in again and rest herself

the discomposur of spirit which thi extraordinari visit threw
elizabeth into could not be easili overcom nor could she for mani
hour learn to think of it less than incessantli ladi catherin it
appear had actual taken the troubl of thi journei from rose
for the sole purpos of break off her suppos engag with mr
darci it wa a ration scheme to be sure but from what the report of
their engag could origin elizabeth wa at a loss to imagin
till she recollect that hi be the intim friend of binglei
and her be the sister of jane wa enough at a time when the
expect of on wed made everybodi eager for anoth to suppli
the idea she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriag of her
sister must bring them more frequent togeth and her neighbour at
luca lodg therefor for through their commun with the
collins the report she conclud had reach ladi catherin had
onli set that down as almost certain and immedi which she had
look forward to as possibl at some futur time
in revolv ladi catherin express howev she could not help
feel some uneasi as to the possibl consequ of her persist
in thi interfer from what she had said of her resolut to
prevent the marriag it occur to elizabeth that she must medit an
applic to her nephew and how he might take a similar
represent of the evil attach to a connect with her she dare
not pronounc she knew not the exact degre of hi affect for hi
aunt or hi depend on her judgment but it wa natur to suppos
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it
wa certain that in enumer the miseri of a marriag with on
whose immedi connect were so unequ to hi own hi aunt would
address him on hi weakest side with hi notion of digniti he would
probabl feel that the argument which to elizabeth had appear weak
and ridicul contain much good sens and solid reason
if he had been waver befor as to what he should do which had often
seem like the advic and entreati of so near a relat might
settl everi doubt and determin him at onc to be as happi as digniti
unblemish could make him in that case he would return no more ladi
catherin might see him in her wai through town and hi engag to
binglei of come again to netherfield must give wai
if therefor an excus for not keep hi promis should come to hi
friend within a few dai she ad i shall know how to understand
it i shall then give over everi expect everi wish of hi
constanc if he is satisfi with onli regret me when he might
have obtain my affect and hand i shall soon ceas to regret him
at all
the surpris of the rest of the famili on hear who their visitor had
been wa veri great but thei obligingli satisfi it with the same
kind of supposit which had appeas mr bennet curios and
elizabeth wa spare from much teas on the subject
the next morn as she wa go down stair she wa met by her
father who came out of hi librari with a letter in hi hand
lizzi said he i wa go to look for you come into my room
she follow him thither and her curios to know what he had to tell

of matrimoni let me congratul you on a veri import conquest
the colour now rush into elizabeth cheek in the instantan
convict of it be a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt
and she wa undetermin whether most to be pleas that he explain
himself at all or offend that hi letter wa not rather address to
herself when her father continu

her eldest sister ha resign it and the chosen partner of her fate
mai be reason look up to as on of the most illustri personag
in thi land can you possibl guess lizzi who is meant by thi
thi young gentleman is bless in a peculiar wai with everyth the
heart of mortal can most desiresplendid properti nobl kindr and

my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evil you mai incur by a

you will be inclin to take immedi advantag of have you ani idea
lizzi who thi gentleman is but now it come out my motiv for
caution you is as followsw have reason to imagin that hi aunt
ladi catherin de bourgh doe not look on the match with a friendli
ey mr darci you see is the man now lizzi i think i have
surpris you could he or the lucas have pitch on ani man within
the circl of our acquaint whose name would have given the lie more
effectu to what thei relat mr darci who never look at ani
woman but to see a blemish and who probabl never look at you in
hi life it is admir
elizabeth tri to join in her father pleasantri but could onli forc
on most reluct smile never had hi wit been direct in a manner so
littl agreeabl to her
ar you not divert
oh ye prai read on
after mention the likelihood of thi marriag to her ladyship last
night she immedi with her usual condescens express what she
felt on the occas when it becam appar that on the score of
some famili object on the part of my cousin she would never give
her consent to what she term so disgrac a match i thought it my
duti to give the speediest intellig of thi to my cousin that she
and her nobl admir mai be awar of what thei ar about and not run
hastili into a marriag which ha not been properli sanction mr
collin moreov add i am truli rejoic that my cousin lydia sad
busi ha been so well hush up and am onli concern that their
live togeth befor the marriag took place should be so gener
known i must not howev neglect the duti of my station or refrain
from declar my amaz at hear that you receiv the young
coupl into your hous as soon as thei were marri it wa an
encourag of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should
veri strenuous have oppos it you ought certainli to forgiv them as
a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their
name to be mention in your hear that is hi notion of
christian forgiv the rest of hi letter is onli about hi dear
charlott situat and hi expect of a young olivebranch but
lizzi you look as if you did not enjoi it you ar not go to be
missish i hope and pretend to be affront at an idl report for
what do we live but to make sport for our neighbour and laugh at them
in our turn
oh cri elizabeth i am exceedingli divert but it is so

about thi report did she call to refus her consent
to thi question hi daughter repli onli with a laugh and as it had
been ask without the least suspicion she wa not distress by hi
repeat it elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her

would rather have cri her father had most cruelli mortifi her by
what he said of mr darci indiffer and she could do noth but

instead of receiv ani such letter of excus from hi friend as

too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth wa secretli form a

thei walk toward the lucas becaus kitti wish to call upon
maria and as elizabeth saw no occas for make it a gener concern
when kitti left them she went boldli on with him alon now wa the
moment for her resolut to be execut and while her courag wa
high she immedi said
mr darci i am a veri selfish creatur and for the sake of give

can no longer help thank you for your unexampl kind to my poor
sister ever sinc i have known it i have been most anxiou to

of my famili i should not have mere my own gratitud to express
i am sorri exceedingli sorri repli darci in a tone of surpris

wa so littl to be trust
you must not blame my aunt lydia thoughtless first betrai to
me that you had been concern in the matter and of cours i could
not rest till i knew the particular let me thank you again and again
in the name of all my famili for that gener compass which induc
you to take so much troubl and bear so mani mortif for the
sake of discov them
if you will thank me he repli let it be for yourself alon
that the wish of give happi to you might add forc to the other
induc which led me on i shall not attempt to deni but your
famili ow me noth much as i respect them i believ i thought
onli of you
elizabeth wa too much embarrass to sai a word after a short paus
her companion ad you ar too gener to trifl with me if your
feel ar still what thei were last april tell me so at onc my
affect and wish ar unchang but on word from you will silenc
me on thi subject for ever
elizabeth feel all the more than common awkward and anxieti of
hi situat now forc herself to speak and immedi though not
veri fluentli gave him to understand that her sentiment had undergon
so materi a chang sinc the period to which he allud as to make
her receiv with gratitud and pleasur hi present assur the
happi which thi repli produc wa such as he had probabl never
felt befor and he express himself on the occas as sensibl and as
warmli as a man violent in love can be suppos to do had elizabeth
been abl to encount hi ey she might have seen how well the
express of heartfelt delight diffus over hi face becam him but
though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feel
which in prove of what import she wa to him made hi affect
everi moment more valuabl
thei walk on without know in what direct there wa too much to
be thought and felt and said for attent to ani other object she
soon learnt that thei were indebt for their present good understand
to the effort of hi aunt who did call on him in her return through
london and there relat her journei to longbourn it motiv and the
substanc of her convers with elizabeth dwell emphat on
everi express of the latter which in her ladyship apprehens
peculiarli denot her pervers and assur in the belief that
such a relat must assist her endeavour to obtain that promis from
her nephew which she had refus to give but unluckili for her
ladyship it effect had been exactli contrariwis
it taught me to hope said he as i had scarc ever allow myself
to hope befor i knew enough of your disposit to be certain that
had you been absolut irrevoc decid against me you would have
acknowledg it to ladi catherin frankli and openli
elizabeth colour and laugh as she repli ye you know enough of
my frank to believ me capabl of that after abus you so
abomin to your face i could have no scrupl in abus you to all
your relat
what did you sai of me that i did not deserv for though your
accus were illfound form on mistaken premis my behaviour
to you at the time had merit the severest reproof it wa
unpardon i cannot think of it without abhorr
we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annex to that
even said elizabeth the conduct of neither if strictli
examin will be irreproach but sinc then we have both i hope
improv in civil
i cannot be so easili reconcil to myself the recollect of what i
then said of my conduct my manner my express dure the whole of
it is now and ha been mani month inexpress pain to me your
reproof so well appli i shall never forget had you behav in a
more gentlemanlik manner those were your word you know not you can
scarc conceiv how thei have tortur me though it wa some time i
confess befor i wa reason enough to allow their justic
i wa certainli veri far from expect them to make so strong an
impress i had not the smallest idea of their be ever felt in such
a wai
i can easili believ it you thought me then devoid of everi proper
feel i am sure you did the turn of your counten i shall never
forget as you said that i could not have address you in ani possibl
wai that would induc you to accept me
oh do not repeat what i then said these recollect will not do at
all i assur you that i have long been most heartili asham of it
darci mention hi letter did it said hedid it soon make you
think better of me did you on read it give ani credit to it
content
she explain what it effect on her had been and how gradual all
her former prejudic had been remov
i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it wa
necessari i hope you have destroi the letter there wa on part
especi the open of it which i should dread your have the power
of read again i can rememb some express which might justli
make you hate me
the letter shall certainli be burnt if you believ it essenti to the
preserv of my regard but though we have both reason to think my
opinion not entir unalter thei ar not i hope quit so easili
chang as that impli
when i wrote that letter repli darci i believ myself perfectli
calm and cool but i am sinc convinc that it wa written in a
dread bitter of spirit
the letter perhap began in bitter but it did not end so the
adieu is chariti itself but think no more of the letter the feel
of the person who wrote and the person who receiv it ar now so wide
differ from what thei were then that everi unpleas circumst
attend it ought to be forgotten you must learn some of my
philosophi think onli of the past as it remembr give you
pleasur
i cannot give you credit for ani philosophi of the kind your
retrospect must be so total void of reproach that the content
aris from them is not of philosophi but what is much better of
ignor but with me it is not so pain recollect will
intrud which cannot which ought not to be repel i have been a
selfish be all my life in practic though not in principl as a
child i wa taught what wa right but i wa not taught to correct my
temper i wa given good principl but left to follow them in pride
and conceit unfortun an onli son for mani year an onli child
i wa spoil by my parent who though good themselv my father
particularli all that wa benevol and amiabl allow encourag
almost taught me to be selfish and overbear to care for none beyond
my own famili circl to think meanli of all the rest of the world to
wish at least to think meanli of their sens and worth compar with
my own such i wa from eight to eightandtwenti and such i might
still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not
ow you you taught me a lesson hard inde at first but most
advantag by you i wa properli humbl i came to you without a
doubt of my recept you show me how insuffici were all my
pretens to pleas a woman worthi of be pleas
had you then persuad yourself that i should
inde i had what will you think of my vaniti i believ you to be
wish expect my address
my manner must have been in fault but not intention i assur
you i never meant to deceiv you but my spirit might often lead me
wrong how you must have hate me after that even
hate you i wa angri perhap at first but my anger soon began to
take a proper direct
i am almost afraid of ask what you thought of me when we met at
pemberlei you blame me for come
no inde i felt noth but surpris
your surpris could not be greater than mine in be notic by you
my conscienc told me that i deserv no extraordinari polit and i
confess that i did not expect to receiv more than my due
my object then repli darci wa to show you by everi civil
in my power that i wa not so mean as to resent the past and i hope
to obtain your forgiv to lessen your ill opinion by let you
see that your reproof had been attend to how soon ani other wish
introduc themselv i can hardli tell but i believ in about half
an hour after i had seen you
he then told her of georgiana delight in her acquaint and of her
disappoint at it sudden interrupt which natur lead to
the caus of that interrupt she soon learnt that hi resolut of
follow her from derbyshir in quest of her sister had been form
befor he quit the inn and that hi graviti and thought there
had arisen from no other struggl than what such a purpos must
comprehend
she express her gratitud again but it wa too pain a subject to
each to be dwelt on farther
after walk sever mile in a leisur manner and too busi to know
anyth about it thei found at last on examin their watch that
it wa time to be at home
what could have becom of mr binglei and jane wa a wonder which
introduc the discuss of their affair darci wa delight with
their engag hi friend had given him the earliest inform of
it
i must ask whether you were surpris said elizabeth
not at all when i went awai i felt that it would soon happen
that is to sai you had given your permiss i guess as much and
though he exclaim at the term she found that it had been pretti much
the case
on the even befor my go to london said he i made a
confess to him which i believ i ought to have made long ago i told
him of all that had occur to make my former interfer in hi
affair absurd and impertin hi surpris wa great he had never had
the slightest suspicion i told him moreov that i believ myself
mistaken in suppos as i had done that your sister wa indiffer
to him and as i could easili perceiv that hi attach to her wa
unab i felt no doubt of their happi togeth
elizabeth could not help smile at hi easi manner of direct hi
friend
did you speak from your own observ said she when you told him
that my sister love him or mere from my inform last spring
from the former i had narrowli observ her dure the two visit
which i had late made her here and i wa convinc of her affect
and your assur of it i suppos carri immedi convict to
him
it did binglei is most unaffectedli modest hi diffid had
prevent hi depend on hi own judgment in so anxiou a case but
hi relianc on mine made everyth easi i wa oblig to confess on
thing which for a time and not unjustli offend him i could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three month
last winter that i had known it and purpos kept it from him he wa
angri but hi anger i am persuad last no longer than he remain
in ani doubt of your sister sentiment he ha heartili forgiven me
now
elizabeth long to observ that mr binglei had been a most delight
friend so easili guid that hi worth wa invalu but she check
herself she rememb that he had yet to learn to be laugh at and
it wa rather too earli to begin in anticip the happi of
binglei which of cours wa to be inferior onli to hi own he
continu the convers till thei reach the hous in the hall thei

from all the other when thei sat down to tabl she had onli to sai in
repli that thei had wander about till she wa beyond her own
knowledg she colour as she spoke but neither that nor anyth
els awaken a suspicion of the truth
the even pass quietli unmark by anyth extraordinari the
acknowledg lover talk and laugh the unacknowledg were silent
darci wa not of a disposit in which happi overflow in mirth
and elizabeth agit and confus rather knew that she wa happi
than felt herself to be so for besid the immedi embarrass
there were other evil befor her she anticip what would be felt in
the famili when her situat becam known she wa awar that no on
like him but jane and even fear that with the other it wa a
dislik which not all hi fortun and consequ might do awai
at night she open her heart to jane though suspicion wa veri far
from miss bennet gener habit she wa absolut incredul here
you ar joke lizzi thi cannot be engag to mr darci no no

serious assur her of it truth
good heaven can it be realli so yet now i must believ you cri
jane my dear dear lizzi i would i do congratul you but ar you
certainforg the questionar you quit certain that you can be
happi with him
there can be no doubt of that it is settl between us alreadi that we
ar to be the happiest coupl in the world but ar you pleas jane
shall you like to have such a brother
veri veri much noth could give either binglei or myself more
delight but we consid it we talk of it as imposs and do you
realli love him quit well enough oh lizzi do anyth rather than
marri without affect ar you quit sure that you feel what you ought
to do
oh ye you will onli think i feel more than i ought to do when i
tell you all
what do you mean
why i must confess that i love him better than i do binglei i am
afraid you will be angri
my dearest sister now be be seriou i want to talk veri serious
let me know everyth that i am to know without delai will you tell me
how long you have love him
it ha been come on so gradual that i hardli know when it began
but i believ i must date it from my first see hi beauti ground
at pemberlei
anoth entreati that she would be seriou howev produc the
desir effect and she soon satisfi jane by her solemn assur of
attach when convinc on that articl miss bennet had noth
further to wish
now i am quit happi said she for you will be as happi as myself i
alwai had a valu for him were it for noth but hi love of you i
must alwai have esteem him but now as binglei friend and your
husband there can be onli binglei and yourself more dear to me but
lizzi you have been veri sly veri reserv with me how littl did you
tell me of what pass at pemberlei and lambton i ow all that i know
of it to anoth not to you
elizabeth told her the motiv of her secreci she had been unwil to
mention binglei and the unsettl state of her own feel had made
her equal avoid the name of hi friend but now she would no longer
conceal from her hi share in lydia marriag all wa acknowledg
and half the night spent in convers
good graciou cri mr bennet as she stood at a window the next
morn if that disagre mr darci is not come here again with
our dear binglei what can he mean by be so tiresom as to be alwai
come here i had no notion but he would go ashoot or someth or
other and not disturb us with hi compani what shall we do with him
lizzi you must walk out with him again that he mai not be in binglei
wai
elizabeth could hardli help laugh at so conveni a propos yet
wa realli vex that her mother should be alwai give him such an
epithet
as soon as thei enter binglei look at her so express and
shook hand with such warmth as left no doubt of hi good inform
and he soon afterward said aloud mr bennet have you no more lane
hereabout in which lizzi mai lose her wai again todai
i advis mr darci and lizzi and kitti said mr bennet to walk
to oakham mount thi morn it is a nice long walk and mr darci ha
never seen the view
it mai do veri well for the other repli mr binglei but i am
sure it will be too much for kitti wont it kitti
kitti own that she had rather stai at home darci profess a great
curios to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silent
consent as she went upstair to get readi mr bennet follow her
sai
i am quit sorri lizzi that you should be forc to have that
disagre man all to yourself but i hope you will not mind it it is
all for jane sake you know and there is no occas for talk to
him except just now and then so do not put yourself to inconveni
dure their walk it wa resolv that mr bennet consent should be
ask in the cours of the even elizabeth reserv to herself the
applic for her mother she could not determin how her mother
would take it sometim doubt whether all hi wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcom her abhorr of the man but whether she
were violent set against the match or violent delight with it it
wa certain that her manner would be equal ill adapt to do credit to
her sens and she could no more bear that mr darci should hear the
first raptur of her joi than the first vehem of her
disapprob
in the even soon after mr bennet withdrew to the librari she saw
mr darci rise also and follow him and her agit on see it wa
extrem she did not fear her father opposit but he wa go to
be made unhappi and that it should be through her mean that she
hi favourit child should be distress him by her choic should be
fill him with fear and regret in dispos of her wa a wretch
reflect and she sat in miseri till mr darci appear again when
look at him she wa a littl reliev by hi smile in a few minut
he approach the tabl where she wa sit with kitti and while
pretend to admir her work said in a whisper go to your father he
want you in the librari she wa gone directli
her father wa walk about the room look grave and anxiou
lizzi said he what ar you do ar you out of your sens to be
accept thi man have not you alwai hate him
how earnestli did she then wish that her former opinion had been more
reason her express more moder it would have spare her from
explan and profess which it wa exceedingli awkward to give
but thei were now necessari and she assur him with some confus
of her attach to mr darci
or in other word you ar determin to have him he is rich to be
sure and you mai have more fine cloth and fine carriag than jane
but will thei make you happi
have you ani other object said elizabeth than your belief of my
indiffer
none at all we all know him to be a proud unpleas sort of man but
thi would be noth if you realli like him
i do i do like him she repli with tear in her ey i love him
inde he ha no improp pride he is perfectli amiabl you do not
know what he realli is then prai do not pain me by speak of him in
such term
lizzi said her father i have given him my consent he is the kind
of man inde to whom i should never dare refus anyth which he
condescend to ask i now give it to you if you ar resolv on
have him but let me advis you to think better of it i know your
disposit lizzi i know that you could be neither happi nor
respect unless you truli esteem your husband unless you look
up to him as a superior your live talent would place you in the

elizabeth still more affect wa earnest and solemn in her repli
and at length by repeat assur that mr darci wa realli the
object of her choic by explain the gradual chang which her
estim of him had undergon relat her absolut certainti that
hi affect wa not the work of a dai but had stood the test of mani
month suspens and enumer with energi all hi good qualiti
she did conquer her father incredul and reconcil him to the
match

sai if thi be the case he deserv you i could not have part with
you my lizzi to anyon less worthi
to complet the favour impress she then told him what mr darci
had voluntarili done for lydia he heard her with astonish
thi is an even of wonder inde and so darci did everyth
made up the match gave the monei paid the fellow debt and got him
hi commiss so much the better it will save me a world of troubl
and economi had it been your uncl do i must and would have
paid him but these violent young lover carri everyth their own
wai i shall offer to pai him tomorrow he will rant and storm about
hi love for you and there will be an end of the matter
he then recollect her embarrass a few dai befor on hi read
mr collinss letter and after laugh at her some time allow her
at last to go sai as she quit the room if ani young men come
for mari or kitti send them in for i am quit at leisur
elizabeth mind wa now reliev from a veri heavi weight and after
half an hour quiet reflect in her own room she wa abl to join
the other with toler composur everyth wa too recent for
gaieti but the even pass tranquilli awai there wa no longer
anyth materi to be dread and the comfort of eas and familiar
would come in time
when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night she follow her
and made the import commun it effect wa most extraordinari
for on first hear it mr bennet sat quit still and unabl to
utter a syllabl nor wa it under mani mani minut that she could
comprehend what she heard though not in gener backward to credit what
wa for the advantag of her famili or that came in the shape of a
lover to ani of them she began at length to recov to fidget about in
her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself

elizabeth spirit soon rise to play again she want mr
darci to account for hi have ever fallen in love with her how could
you begin said she i can comprehend your go on charmingli when
you had onc made a begin but what could set you off in the first
place
i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the word which
laid the foundat it is too long ago i wa in the middl befor i
knew that i had begun
my beauti you had earli withstood and as for my mannersmi behaviour
to you wa at least alwai border on the uncivil and i never spoke
to you without rather wish to give you pain than not now be
sincer did you admir me for my impertin
for the liveli of your mind i did
you mai as well call it impertin at onc it wa veri littl less
the fact is that you were sick of civil of defer of offici
attent you were disgust with the women who were alwai speak
and look and think for your approb alon i rous and
interest you becaus i wa so unlik them had you not been realli
amiabl you would have hate me for it but in spite of the pain you
took to disguis yourself your feel were alwai nobl and just and
in your heart you thoroughli despis the person who so assidu
court you therei have save you the troubl of account for it
and realli all thing consid i begin to think it perfectli
reason to be sure you know no actual good of mebut nobodi think
of that when thei fall in love
wa there no good in your affection behaviour to jane while she wa
ill at netherfield
dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtu of it
by all mean my good qualiti ar under your protect and you ar
to exagger them as much as possibl and in return it belong to me
to find occas for teas and quarrel with you as often as mai
be and i shall begin directli by ask you what made you so unwil
to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you
first call and afterward dine here why especi when you
call did you look as if you did not care about me
becaus you were grave and silent and gave me no encourag
but i wa embarrass
and so wa i
you might have talk to me more when you came to dinner
a man who had felt less might
how unlucki that you should have a reason answer to give and that
i should be so reason as to admit it but i wonder how long you
would have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when
you would have spoken if i had not ask you my resolut of
thank you for your kind to lydia had certainli great effect too
much i am afraid for what becom of the moral if our comfort
spring from a breach of promis for i ought not to have mention the
subject thi will never do
you need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectli fair ladi
catherin unjustifi endeavour to separ us were the mean of
remov all my doubt i am not indebt for my present happi to
your eager desir of express your gratitud i wa not in a humour to
wait for an open of your my aunt intellig had given me hope
and i wa determin at onc to know everyth
ladi catherin ha been of infinit us which ought to make her happi
for she love to be of us but tell me what did you come down to
netherfield for wa it mere to ride to longbourn and be embarrass
or had you intend ani more seriou consequ
my real purpos wa to see you and to judg if i could whether i
might ever hope to make you love me my avow on or what i avow to
myself wa to see whether your sister wa still partial to binglei and
if she were to make the confess to him which i have sinc made
shall you ever have courag to announc to ladi catherin what is to
befal her
i am more like to want time than courag elizabeth but it ought to
be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done
directli
and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and
admir the even of your write as anoth young ladi onc did but
i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglect
from an unwilling to confess how much her intimaci with mr darci
had been overr elizabeth had never yet answer mr gardin
long letter but now have that to commun which she knew would
be most welcom she wa almost asham to find that her uncl and aunt
had alreadi lost three dai of happi and immedi wrote as
follow
i would have thank you befor my dear aunt as i ought to have done
for your long kind satisfactori detail of particular but to sai the
truth i wa too cross to write you suppos more than realli exist
but now suppos as much as you choos give a loos to your fanci
indulg your imagin in everi possibl flight which the subject will

err you must write again veri soon and prais him a great deal more
than you did in your last i thank you again and again for not go to

happiest creatur in the world perhap other peopl have said so

kinder answer than she knew wa deserv

sudden remov wa soon evid ladi catherin had been render so
exceedingli angri by the content of her nephew letter that
charlott realli rejoic in the match wa anxiou to get awai till
the storm wa blown over at such a moment the arriv of her friend
wa a sincer pleasur to elizabeth though in the cours of their
meet she must sometim think the pleasur dearli bought when she
saw mr darci expos to all the parad and obsequi civil of her
husband he bore it howev with admir calm he could even
listen to sir william luca when he compliment him on carri awai
the brightest jewel of the countri and express hi hope of their all
meet frequent at st jamess with veri decent composur if he did
shrug hi shoulder it wa not till sir william wa out of sight
mr philipss vulgar wa anoth and perhap a greater tax on hi
forbear and though mr philip as well as her sister stood in
too much aw of him to speak with the familiar which binglei
goodhumour encourag yet whenev she did speak she must be
vulgar nor wa her respect for him though it made her more quiet at
all like to make her more eleg elizabeth did all she could to
shield him from the frequent notic of either and wa ever anxiou to
keep him to herself and to those of her famili with whom he might
convers without mortif and though the uncomfort feel
aris from all thi took from the season of courtship much of it

accomplish of her earnest desir in the establish of so mani of
her children produc so happi an effect as to make her a sensibl
amiabl wellinform woman for the rest of her life though perhap
it wa lucki for her husband who might not have relish domest
felic in so unusu a form that she still wa occasion nervou
and invari silli
mr bennet miss hi second daughter exceedingli hi affect for her

mr binglei and jane remain at netherfield onli a twelvemonth so near
a vicin to her mother and meryton relat wa not desir even to

her two elder sister in societi so superior to what she had gener
known her improv wa great she wa not of so ungovern a

becam by proper attent and manag less irrit less
ignor and less insipid from the further disadvantag of lydia
societi she wa of cours carefulli kept and though mr wickham
frequent invit her to come and stai with her with the promis of
ball and young men her father would never consent to her go
mari wa the onli daughter who remain at home and she wa necessarili
drawn from the pursuit of accomplish by mr bennet be quit
unabl to sit alon mari wa oblig to mix more with the world but
she could still moral over everi morn visit and as she wa no
longer mortifi by comparison between her sister beauti and her own
it wa suspect by her father that she submit to the chang without
much reluct
as for wickham and lydia their charact suffer no revolut from
the marriag of her sister he bore with philosophi the convict that
elizabeth must now becom acquaint with whatev of hi ingratitud
and falsehood had befor been unknown to her and in spite of
everyth wa not wholli without hope that darci might yet be
prevail on to make hi fortun the congratulatori letter which
elizabeth receiv from lydia on her marriag explain to her that by
hi wife at least if not by himself such a hope wa cherish the
letter wa to thi effect
my dear lizzi
i wish you joi if you love mr darci half so well as i do my dear
wickham you must be veri happi it is a great comfort to have you
so rich and when you have noth els to do i hope you will
think of us i am sure wickham would like a place at court veri
much and i do not think we shall have quit monei enough to live
upon without some help ani place would do of about three or four
hundr a year but howev do not speak to mr darci about it
if you had rather not

as it happen that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavour in
her answer to put an end to everi entreati and expect of the kind
such relief howev as it wa in her power to afford by the practic
of what might be call economi in her own privat expens she
frequent sent them it had alwai been evid to her that such an

restor of peac dismiss them to a home wa unsettl in the

cheap situat and alwai spend more than thei ought hi affect
for her soon sunk into indiffer her last a littl longer and
in spite of her youth and her manner she retain all the claim to
reput which her marriag had given her though darci could never
receiv him at pemberlei yet for elizabeth sake he assist him
further in hi profess lydia wa occasion a visitor there when
her husband wa gone to enjoi himself in london or bath and with the
binglei thei both of them frequent stai so long that even
binglei goodhumour wa overcom and he proceed so far as to talk
of give them a hint to be gone
miss binglei wa veri deepli mortifi by darci marriag but as she
thought it advis to retain the right of visit at pemberlei she
drop all her resent wa fonder than ever of georgiana almost as

pemberlei wa now georgiana home and the attach of the sister
