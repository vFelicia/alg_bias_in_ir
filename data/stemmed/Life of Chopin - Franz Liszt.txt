will be on of exceed interest it is a short glow and gener
sketch from the hand of franz liszt who consid in the doubl
light of compos and perform ha no live equal of the origin
and romant chopin the most ether subtl and delic among our
modern tonepoet it is a rare thing for a great artist to write on
art to leav the passion world of sound or color for the colder
realm of word rarer still for him to abdic even temporarili hi
own throne to stand patient and hold aloft the blaze torch of hi
own geniu to illum the gloomi grave of anoth yet thi ha liszt

deepli regret as he mai be by the whole bodi of artist lament by
all who have ever known him we must still be permit to doubt if
the time ha even yet arriv in which he whose loss is so peculiarli
deplor by ourselv can be appreci in accord with hi
just valu or occupi that high rank which in all probabl will be
assign him in the futur
if it ha been often prove that no on is a prophet in hi own
countri is it not equal true that the prophet the men of the
futur who feel it life in advanc and prefigur it in their work
ar never recogn as prophet in their own time it would be
presumptu to assert that it can ever be otherwis in vain mai the
young gener of artist protest against the antiprogress
whose invari custom it is to assault and beat down the live with
the dead time alon can test the real valu or reveal the hidden
beauti either of music composit or of kindr effort in the
sister art
as the manifold form of art ar but differ incant charg

appear to mani as if written in a languag of which thei were ignor
and which that reason will in itself be suffici to induc them to
pronounc a barbar dialect the troubl of accustom the ear to it
will repel mani who will in consequ refus to make a studi of it
through the more vivid and youth organ less enthral
by the chain of habit through the more ardent spirit won first by
curios then fill with passion for the new idiom must it penetr

do not restrict themselv within the limit of convent routin
have consequ more need than other artist of the aid of time
thei cannot hope that death will bring that instantan plusvalu to

renew to the profit of hi manuscript the decept practic by on
of the great flemish painter who wish in hi lifetim to benefit

whatev mai be the present popular of ani part of the product of

to be presum that poster will award to hi work an estim of
a far higher charact of a much more earnest natur than ha hitherto
been award them a high rank must be assign by the futur historian
of music to on who distinguish himself in art by a geniu for melodi
so rare by such grace and remark enlarg of the harmon
tissu and hi triumph will be justli prefer to mani of far more
extend surfac though the work of such victor mai be plai and
replai by the greatest number of instrument and be sung and resung
by pass crowd of prime donn
in confin himself exclus to the piano chopin ha in our
opinion given proof of on of the most essenti qualiti of a
composera just appreci of the form in which he possess
the power to excel yet thi veri fact to which we attach so much
import ha been injuri to the extent of hi fame it would have
been most difficult for ani other writer gift with such high harmon
and melod power to have resist the temptat of the sing of
the bow the liquid sweet of the flute or the deafen swell of
the trumpet which we still persist in believ the onli forerunn
of the antiqu goddess from whom we woo the sudden favor what strong
convict base upon reflect must have been requisit to have
induc him to restrict himself to a circl appar so much more
barren what warmth of creativ geniu must have been necessari to have
forc from it appar arid a fresh growth of luxuri bloom
unhop for in such a soil what intuit penetr is repeal by
thi exclus choic which wrest the differ effect of the
variou instrument from their habitu domain where the whole foam of
sound would have broken at their feet transport them into a sphere
more limit inde but far more ideal what confid percept
of the futur power of hi instrument must have presid over hi
voluntari renunci of an empiric so wide spread that anoth
would have thought it a mistak a folli to have wrest such great
thought from their ordinari interpret how sincer should we
rever him for thi devot to the beauti for it own sake which
induc him not to yield to the gener propens to scatter each light
sprai of melodi over a hundr orchestr desk and enabl him to
augment the resourc of art in teach how thei mai be concentr
in a more limit space elabor at less expens of mean and
condens in time
far from be ambiti of the uproar of an orchestra chopin wa
satisfi to see hi thought integr produc upon the ivori of the
keyboard succeed in hi aim of lose noth in power without
pretend to orchestr effect or to the brush of the scenepaint
oh we have not yet studi with suffici earnest and attent
the design of hi delic pencil habitu as we ar in these
dai to consid onli those compos worthi of a great name who have
written at least halfadozen opera as mani oratorio and variou
symphoni vainli requir everi musician to do everi thing nai a
littl more than everi thing howev wide diffus thi idea mai be
it justic is to sai the least highli problemat we ar far
from contest the glori more difficult of attain or the real
superior of the epic poet who displai their splendid creation upon
so larg a plan but we desir that materi proport in music should
be estim by the same measur which is appli to dimens in other
branch of the fine art as for exampl in paint where a canva
of twenti inch squar as the vision of ezekiel or le cimetier by
ruysdael is place among the chef doeuvr and is more highli valu
than pictur of a far larger size even though thei might be from the
hand of a ruben or a tintoret in literatur is berang less a great
poet becaus he ha condens hi thought within the narrow limit
of hi song doe not petrarch ow hi fame to hi sonnet and among
those who most frequent repeat their sooth rhyme how mani know
ani thing of the exist of hi long poem on africa we cannot doubt
that the prejudic which would deni the superior of an artistthough
he should have produc noth but such sonata as franz schubert ha
given usov on who ha portion out the insipid melodi of mani
opera which it were useless to cite will disappear and that in
music also we will yet take into account the eloqu and abil
with which the thought and feel ar express whatev mai be
the size of the composit in which thei ar develop or the mean
emploi to interpret them
in make an analysi of the work of chopin we meet with beauti of a
high order express entir new and a harmon tissu as origin
as erudit in hi composit bold is alwai justifi rich
even exuber never interfer with clear singular never
degener into uncouth fantastic the sculptur is never
disorderli the luxuri of ornament never overload the chast eloqu
of the princip line hi best work abound in combin which
mai be said to form an epoch in the handl of music style dare
brilliant and attract thei disguis their profund under so much
grace their scienc under so mani charm that it is with difficulti
we free ourselv suffici from their magic enthral to judg
coldli of their theoret valu their worth ha howev alreadi
been felt but it will be more highli estim when the time arriv
for a critic examin of the servic render by them to art
dure that period of it cours travers by chopin
it is to him we ow the extens of chord struck togeth in
arpeggio or en batteri the chromat sinuos of which hi page
offer such strike exampl the littl group of superad note
fall like light drop of pearli dew upon the melod figur thi
speci of adorn had hitherto been model onli upon the fioritur
of the great old school of italian song the embellish for
the voic had been servil copi by the piano although becom
stereotyp and monoton he impart to them the charm of novelti
surpris and varieti unsuit for the vocalist but in perfect keep
with the charact of the instrument he invent the admir harmon
progress which have given a seriou charact to page which in
consequ of the light of their subject made no pretens to ani
import but of what consequ is the subject is it not the idea
which is develop through it the emot with which it vibrat
which expand elev and ennobl it what tender melancholi what
subtleti what sagac in the masterpiec of la fontain although
the subject ar so familiar the titl so modest equal unassum
ar the titl and subject of the studi and prelud yet the
composit of chopin so modestli name ar not the less type of
perfect in a mode creat by himself and stamp like all hi
other work with the high impress of hi poetic geniu written in the
commenc of hi career thei ar character by a youth
vigor not to be found in some of hi subsequ work even when more
elabor finish and richer in combin a vigor which is
entir lost in hi latest product mark by an overexcit
sensibl a morbid irrit and give pain intim of
hi own state of suffer and exhaust
if it were our intent to discuss the develop of piano music in
the languag of the school we would dissect hi magnific page
which afford so rich a field for scientif observ we would in
the first place analyz hi nocturn ballad impromptu scherzo
which ar full of refin of harmoni never heard befor bold
and of startl origin we would also examin hi polonais
mazourka waltz and bolero but thi is not the time or place
for such a studi which would be interest onli to the adept in
counterpoint and thoroughbass
it is the feel which overflow in all hi work which ha render
them known and popular feel of a charact emin romant
subject individu peculiar to their author yet awaken immedi
sympathi appeal not alon to the heart of that countri indebt
to him for yet on glori more but to all who can be touch by the
misfortun of exil or move by the tender of love not content
with success in the field in which he wa free to design with such
perfect grace the contour chosen by himself chopin also wish to
fetter hi ideal thought with classic chain hi concerto and sonata
ar beauti inde but we mai discern in them more effort than
inspir hi creativ geniu wa imperi fantast and impuls
hi beauti were onli manifest fulli in entir freedom we believ
he offer violenc to the charact of hi geniu whenev he sought to
subject it to rule to classif to regul not hi own
and which he could not forc into harmoni with the exact of hi own
mind he wa on of those origin be whose grace ar onli fulli
displai when thei have cut themselv adrift from all bondag and
float on at their own wild will swai onli by the ever undul
impuls of their own mobil natur
he wa perhap induc to desir thi doubl success through the
exampl of hi friend mickiewicz who have been the first to gift
hi countri with romant poetri form a school in sclavic literatur
by the public of hi dziadi and hi romant ballad as earli
as 1818 prove afterward by the public at hi grazyna and
wallenrod that he could triumph over the difficulti that classic
restrict oppos to inspir and that when hold the classic
lyre of the ancient poet he wa still master in make analog
attempt we do not think chopin ha been equal success he could
not retain within the squar of an angular and rigid mould that
float and indetermin contour which so fascin us in hi
grace concept he could not introduc in it unyield line
that shadowi and sketchi indecis which disguis the skeleton the
whole framework of form drape it in the mist of float vapor such
as surround the whitebosom maid of ossian when thei permit
mortal to catch some vagu yet love outlin from their home in the
chang drift blind cloud
some of these effort howev ar resplend with a rare digniti of
style and passag of exceed interest of surpris grandeur mai
be found among them as an exampl of thi we cite the adagio of the
second concerto for which he evinc a decid prefer and which
he like to repeat frequent the accessori design ar in hi best
manner while the princip phrase is of an admir breadth it
altern with a recit which assum a minor kei and which seem
to be it antistroph the whole of thi piec is of a perfect
almost ideal it express now radiant with light now full of
tender patho it seem as if on had chosen a happi vale of temp
a magnific landscap flood with summer glow and lustr as a
background for the rehears of some dire scene of mortal anguish a
bitter and irrepar regret seiz the wildlythrob human heart
even in the midst of the incompar splendor of extern natur thi
contrast is sustain by a fusion of tone a soften of gloomi hue
which prevent the intrus of aught rude or brusqu that might awaken
a disson in the touch impress produc which while sadden
joi sooth and soften the bitter of sorrow
it would be imposs to pass in silenc the funer march insert in
the first sonata which wa arrang for the orchestra and perform
for the first time at hi own obsequi what other accent could have
been found capabl of express with the same heartbreak effect
the emot the tear which should accompani to the last long sleep
on who had taught in a manner so sublim how great loss should
be mourn we onc heard it remark by a nativ of hi own countri
these page could onli have been written by a pole all that the
funer train of an entir nation weep it own ruin and death can
be imagin to feel of desol woe of majest sorrow wail in
the music ring of thi pass bell mourn in the toll of thi
solemn knell as it accompani the mighti escort on it wai to the
still citi of the dead the intens of mystic hope the devout appeal
to superhuman piti to infinit merci to a dread justic which number
everi cradl and watch everi tomb the exalt resign which ha
wreath so much grief with halo so lumin the nobl endur of so

know not to despairresound in thi melancholi chant whose voic of
supplic break the heart all of most pure of most holi of
most believ of most hope in the heart of children women
and priest resound quiver and trembl there with irresist
vibrat we feel it is not the death of a singl warrior we mourn
while other hero live to aveng him but that a whole gener of
warrior ha forev fallen leav the death song to be chant but by
wail women weep children and helpless priest yet thi
melope so funer so full of desol woe is of such penetr
sweet that we can scarc deem it of thi earth these sound
in which the wild passion of human anguish seem chill by aw and
soften by distanc impos a profound medit as if chant
by angel thei float alreadi in the heaven the cry of a nation
anguish mount to the veri throne of god the appeal of human grief
from the lyre of seraph neither cri nor hoars groan nor impiou
blasphemi nor furiou imprec troubl for a moment the sublim

recal the furi of cassandra the prostrat of priam the frenzi of

in the survivor of thi christian ilion the bitter of anguish and
the cowardic of despair their sorrow is no longer mark by earthli
weak rais itself from the soil wet with blood and tear it
spring forward to implor god and have noth more to hope from
earth it supplic the suprem judg with prayer so poignant
that our heart in listen break under the weight of an august
compass it would be a mistak to suppos that all the composit
of chopin ar depriv of the feel which he ha deem best to
suppress in thi great work not so perhap human natur is not capabl
of maintain alwai thi mood of energet abneg of courag
submiss we meet with breath of stifl rage of suppress
anger in mani passag of hi write and mani of hi studi as
well as hi scherzo depict a concentr exasper and despair
which ar sometim manifest in bitter ironi sometim in intoler
hauteur these dark apostroph of hi muse have attract less
attent have been less fulli understood than hi poem of more
tender color the person charact of chopin had someth to
do with thi gener misconcept kind courteou and affabl of
tranquil and almost joyou manner he would not suffer the secret
convuls which agit him to be even suspect
hi charact wa inde not easili understood a thousand subtl
shade mingl cross contradict and disguis each other

conceal in reserv which assur them the advantag in intellect
or feel thei suffer their interrog to remain in ignor of

thei would be more admir or less esteem and which thei well know
how to hide under the subtl smile of an almost impercept mockeri
delight in the pleasur of mystif from the most spiritu or
comic to the most bitter and melancholi thei mai perhap find in
thi decept railleri an extern formula of disdain for the veil
express of the superior which thei intern claim but
which claim thei veil with the caution and astut natur to the
oppress
the frail and sickli organ of chopin not permit him the
energet express of hi passion he gave to hi friend onli the
gentl and affection phase of hi natur in the busi eager life
of larg citi where no on ha time to studi the destini of anoth
where everi on is judg by hi extern activ veri few think it
worth while to attempt to penetr the enigma of individu charact
those who enjoi familiar intercours with chopin could not be blind
to the impati and ennui he experienc in be upon the calm
charact of hi manner so promptli believ and mai not the artist
reveng the man as hi health wa too frail to permit him to give vent
to hi impati through the vehem of hi execut he sought to
compens himself by pour thi bitter over those page which he
love to hear perform with a vigor footnot it wa hi delight to
hear them execut by the great liszt himselftransl which he

such emot have been of so much the more import in the life

those who have seen the polonais danc even as late as the begin

our dearest person recollect we cannot forc ourselv to make
the mourn effort to color the gloomi shroud veil the skill we
onc love with the brilliant hue thei would exact at our hand we
feel our loss too bitterli to attempt such an analysi and what result
would it be possibl to attain with all our effort we could not hope
to convei to those who have never heard him ani just concept of that
fascin so ineff poetic that charm subtl and penetr
as the delic perfum of the vervain or the ethiopian calla which

dian who murmur in hi ear their most confidenti complaint their
most secret dream the style and the manner of concept of chopin
remind us of nodier he knew that he did not act upon the mass that
he could not warm the multitud which is like a sea of lead and as
heavi to set in motion and which though it wave mai be melt and
render malleabl by heat requir the power arm of an athlet
cyclop to manipul fuse and pour into mould where the dull
metal glow and seeth under the electr fire becom thought and

onli perfectli appreci in those meet unfortun too few
in which all hi hearer were prepar to follow him into those sphere
which the ancient imagin to be enter onli through a gate of ivori
to be surround by pilast of diamond and surmount by a dome
arch with fawncolor crystal upon which plai the variou dye of
the prism sphere like the mexican opal whose kaleidoscop foci

frequent heard i am not suit for concert give the public
intimid me their look onli stimul by curios paralyz me
their strang face oppress me their breath stifl me but youyou
ar destin for it for when you do not gain your public you have the
forc to assault to overwhelm to control to compel them
consciou of how much wa necessari for the comprehens of hi
peculiar talent he plai but rare in public with the except of
some concert given at hi debut in 1831 in vienna and munich he gave
no more except in pari be inde not abl to travel on account of
hi health which wa so precari that dure entir month he would
appear to be in an almost dy state dure the onli excurs which
he made with a hope that the mild of a southern climat would be
more conduc to hi health hi condit wa frequent so alarm
that more than onc the hotel keeper demand payment for the bed and
mattress he occupi in order to have them burn deem him alreadi
arriv at that stage of consumpt in which it becom so highli
contagi we believ howev if we mai be permit to sai it that
hi concert were less fatigu to hi physic constitut than to
hi artist suscept we think that hi voluntari abneg of
popular applaus veil an intern wound he wa perfectli awar of hi
own superior perhap it did not receiv suffici reverber
and echo from without to give him the tranquil assur that he wa
perfectli appreci no doubt in the absenc of popular acclam
he ask himself how far a chosen audienc through the enthusiasm
of it applaus wa abl to replac the great public which he
relinquish few understood himdid those few inde understand him
aright a gnaw feel of discont of which he himself scarc
comprehend the caus secretli undermin him we have seen him
almost shock by eulogi the prais to which he wa justli entitl not
reach him en mass he look upon isol commend as almost
wound that he felt himself not onli slightli but badli applaud
wa suffici evid by the polish phrase with which like
troublesom dust he shook such prais off make it quit evid
that he prefer to be left undisturb in the enjoy of hi
solitari feel to injudici commend
too fine a connoisseur in railleri too ingeni satirist ever to
expos himself to sarcasm he never assum the role of a geniu
misunderstood with a good grace and under an appar satisfact he
conceal so entir the wound given to hi just pride that it veri
exist wa scarc suspect but not without reason might the
gradual increas rariti footnot sometim he pass year without
give a singl concert we believ the on given by him in pleyel
room in 1844 wa after an interv of nearli ten year of hi
concert be attribut rather to the wish he felt to avoid occas
which did not bring him the tribut he merit than to physic
debil inde he put hi strength to rude proof in the mani lesson
which he alwai gave and the mani hour he spent at hi own piano
it is to be regret that the indubit advantag for the artist
result from the cultiv of onli a select audienc should be so
sensibl diminish by the rare and cold express of it sympathi
the glace which cover the grace of the elit as it doe the fruit of
their dessert the imperturb calm of their most earnest enthusiasm
could not be satisfactori to chopin the poet torn from hi solitari
inspir can onli find it again in the interest more than
attent vivid and anim of hi audienc he can never hope to
regain it in the cold look of an areopagu assembl to judg him he
must feel that he move that he agit those who hear him that hi

that he draw them on with him in hi flight toward the infinit as

a natur curios is gener felt to know someth of the live

as the sclave gener ar in consequ of hi french origin the

it he did not think it suffici sonor and he deem it geniu
cold thi opinion is veri preval among the pole who although
speak it with great facil often better than their nativ tongu

thi express reveal the depth of hi be noth could be

soul when she knew that no devot tender as her own ever came to
sweeten the exist of on whom she had ador with that ingenu
submiss that exclus devot that entir selfforget

those who ar gift by natur with the beauti yet fatal energi

thi young polish ladi unfortun separ from chopin remain
faith to hi memori to all that wa left of him she devot herself
to hi parent the father of chopin would never suffer the portrait
which she had drawn of him in the dai of hope to be replac by
anoth though from the hand of a far more skil artist we saw the
pale cheek of thi melancholi woman glow like alabast when a light
shine through it snow mani year afterward when in gaze upon thi
pictur she met the ey of hi father
the amiabl charact of chopin won for him while at colleg the love
of hi fellow collegi particularli that of princ czetwertynski

them at the hous of their mother the princess louis czetwertynska
who cultiv music with a true feel for it beauti and who soon
discov the poet in the musician perhap she wa the first who
made chopin feel the charm of be understood as well as heard the
princess wa still beauti and possess a sympathet soul unit
to mani high qualiti her saloon wa on of the most brilliant and

while still veri young he ha often cadenc their step to the chord

read the heart which were attract to him by friendship and the grace

mixtur of leaven and cream of rose of gunpowd and tear of angel
the poetic ideal of hi nation is form when hi wander finger ran

ask him to plai a simpl prelud then soften by the tone lean
her round arm upon the instrument to support her dream head while
she suffer the young artist to divin in the dewi glitter of the

sportiv nymph throng around him and beg him for some waltz of

danc upon the dai in which he saw these exquisit fairi at some
magic fete adorn with that brilliant coquetri which sparkl like
electr fire and flash from heart to heart heighten love blind
it or rob it of all hope and when the muslin of india which the
greek would have said were woven of air were replac by the heavier
fold of venetian velvet and the perfum rose and sculptur petal
of the hothous camellia gave wai to the gorgeou bouquet of the
jewel casket it often seem to him that howev good the orchestra
might be the dancer glide less rapidli over the floor that their
laugh wa less sonor their ey less lumin than upon those
even in which the danc had been suddenli improvis becaus he
had succeed in electrifi hi audienc through the magic of hi

doe not rule those stoni and calcar veget whose hard and
brittl growth take a name of such sad contrast flower of iron flo

hi earli introduct into thi societi in which regular of form

himself nor studi to be a nation musician like all truli nation
poet he sang spontan without premedit design or preconceiv
choic all that inspir dictat to him as we hear it gush forth
in hi song without labor almost without effort he repeat in the
most ideal form the emot which had anim and embellish hi

not without reason ha the task been undertaken of collect the

of still deeper interest to trace the influenc form the
characterist power of the author most deepli inspir by the geniu

great divis of the german and italian school of music but with
the immens develop which thi art seem destin to attain perhap
renew for us the gloriou era of the painter of the cinqu cento it
is highli probabl that compos will appear whose work will be mark
by an origin drawn from differ of organ of race and

more complet develop more poetic true more interest to

uncertain vagu and tremul sketch of the uncultur peopl
chopin must be rank among the first musician thu individu in

have given us the same mode the remembr of the same thing a
reproduct which would soon have grown wearisom serv but to
multipli composit of similar form which must have soon grown
more or less monoton it is becaus he fill these form with the

by the analog of word and imag we should like to render it
possibl for our reader to comprehend the exquisit yet irrit

human affect in the antiqu train of the beauti canephoro who
carri the fragil and perfum flower to adorn some hapless victim

chopin spoke frequent and almost by prefer of madam sand without
