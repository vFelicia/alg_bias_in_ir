handbook of wool knit and crochet
a lesson in knit
illustr figur 1 cast on with two needl
the first thing to be done in knit is to cast on or as it is
sometim call to set up the foundat figur 1 there ar
sever method for thi the follow be that prefer and
gener us by the writer leav a spare end of thread suffici
for the number of stitch you wish to cast on ly toward the left
the spool or ball from which the workingthread is drawn be at the
right lai the thread between the littl finger and the third of the
left hand bring the workingthread across the palm of the hand around
the thumb and back between the forefing and second finger bend the
forefing over thi thread which pass between it and the second
finger pass it under the thread which cross the palm of the hand
and then draw the forefing back or straighten it which will give you
a loop with cross thread put the needl under the lower part of thi
loop which draw from the ball bring the workingthread or
ballthread around the point of needl from right to left as in plain
knit draw it back through the loop slip off the latter and draw
up the left thread then proce to make the cross loop and knit it
off in the same wai for the next and follow stitch the whole
oper is veri simpl although the instruct seem long becaus
explicit take your needl and yarn or thread and follow them through
carefulli and you will veri soon master the cross cast on
anoth method prefer by mani and practic the same in effect
except that the edg is not quit so firm is as follow loop the
thread around the left forefing hold the spare end between thumb
and second finger pass the needl upward through the loop pass the
thread around the point draw back through the loop slip off the latter
and pull up the spare thread by pass the needl under the loop or
lower thread instead of through it bring it back through and then
knit off you will realli get the cross loop and mani find thi
method easier than the first the thread us in cast on mai be
doubl particularli for begin a stock mitten or ani articl
where much wear come
cast on mai also be done with two needl and mani like thi method
when there ar mani stitch twist a loop around the needl held in the
left hand bring the end of thread or spare thread to the front
cross the workingthread to hold it in placeor if prefer
simpli tie a slipknot and put the loop on the left needl insert the
right needl through thi loop from left to right put thread around
point of right needl and draw through the loop bring the right
needl again in front of left thu far the process is quit like that
of plain knit keep the right needl still in the new stitch or
loop transfer the stitch to the left needl by bring the latter in
front and put the point through the loop from front to back leav
the right needl in place for the next stitch the loop ar not slip
off as in knit plain but transfer so that all ar kept on the
needl a littl practis will enabl on to cast on thu veri rapidli
and evenli
illustr figur 2 knit plain
the plain knit figur 2 is done as follow have cast on the
requisit number of stitch insert the right needl through the front
of left needl from left to right the right needl pass behind the
left carri the thread around point of right needl and bring it down
between the two needl then draw the point of right needl back and
through the stitch form the new stitch on right needl and let
the other slip off the left push down the point of left needl to
facilit thi process repeat until all the stitch ar knit off
and the row is complet where there ar edg to be join as in
knit back and front of a sweater it is a good plan to slip the
first stitch of each row
right here a suggest about the method of hold the thread mai be of
valu by the first method the thread is carri over the littl finger
of right hand under second and third finger and over the tip of the
forefing which should be held close to the work it is thi finger
which pass the thread over point of right needl for the new stitch
by anoth method the thread is carri over the left forefing under
second and third and over the littl finger exactli as it is held for
crochet insert the right needl through 1st stitch on left needl in
usual wai push it over the thread on left forefing and draw thi
back through the stitch with the point of right needl onli the needl
is held in the right hand and mani worker claim that the work is much
more rapidli done
