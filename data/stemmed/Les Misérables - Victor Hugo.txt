in parliamentari famili in spite of thi marriag howev it wa
said that charl myriel creat a great deal of talk he wa well
form though rather short in statur eleg grace intellig
the whole of the first portion of hi life had been devot to the
world and to gallantri

dai the fall of hi own famili the tragic spectacl of 93 which
were perhap even more alarm to the emigr who view them from
a distanc with the magnifi power of terrordid these caus the
idea of renunci and solitud to germin in him wa he in the
midst of these distract these affect which absorb hi life
suddenli smitten with on of those mysteri and terribl blow which
sometim overwhelm by strike to hi heart a man whom public
catastroph would not shake by strike at hi exist and hi
fortun no on could have told all that wa known wa that when he
return from itali he wa a priest

sire said m myriel you ar look at a good man and i at a
great man each of us can profit by it
that veri even the emperor ask the cardin the name of the cur
and some time afterward m myriel wa utterli astonish to learn that
he had been appoint bishop of d
what truth wa there after all in the stori which were invent as
to the earli portion of m myriel life no on knew veri few
famili had been acquaint with the myriel famili befor the
revolut
m myriel had to undergo the fate of everi newcom in a littl town
where there ar mani mouth which talk and veri few head which think
he wa oblig to undergo it although he wa a bishop and becaus he
wa a bishop but after all the rumor with which hi name wa
connect were rumor onlynois sai word less than
wordspalabr as the energet languag of the south express it
howev that mai be after nine year of episcop power and of
resid in d all the stori and subject of convers which
engross petti town and petti peopl at the outset had fallen into
profound oblivion no on would have dare to mention them no on
would have dare to recal them
m myriel had arriv at d accompani by an elderli spinster
mademoisel baptistin who wa hi sister and ten year hi junior
their onli domest wa a femal servant of the same ag as
mademoisel baptistin and name madam magloir who after have
been the servant of m le cur now assum the doubl titl of maid
to mademoisel and housekeep to monseigneur
mademoisel baptistin wa a long pale thin gentl creatur she
realiz the ideal express by the word respect for it seem
that a woman must need be a mother in order to be vener she had
never been pretti her whole life which had been noth but a
success of holi deed had final confer upon her a sort of
pallor and transpar and as she advanc in year she had acquir
what mai be call the beauti of good what had been lean in
her youth had becom transpar in her matur and thi diaphan
allow the angel to be seen she wa a soul rather than a virgin her
person seem made of a shadow there wa hardli suffici bodi to
provid for sex a littl matter enclos a light larg ey forev
droopinga mere pretext for a soul remain on the earth
madam magloir wa a littl fat white old woman corpul and
bustl alwai out of breathin the first place becaus of her
activ and in the next becaus of her asthma
on hi arriv m myriel wa instal in the episcop palac with
the honor requir by the imperi decre which class a bishop
immedi after a majorgener the mayor and the presid paid the
first call on him and he in turn paid the first call on the gener
and the prefect
the instal over the town wait to see it bishop at work
chapter iim myriel becom m welcom
the episcop palac of d adjoin the hospit
the episcop palac wa a huge and beauti hous built of stone at
the begin of the last centuri by m henri puget doctor of theologi
of the faculti of pari abb of simor who had been bishop of d in
1712 thi palac wa a genuin seignori resid everyth about
it had a grand airth apart of the bishop the drawingroom
the chamber the princip courtyard which wa veri larg with walk
encircl it under arcad in the old florentin fashion and garden
plant with magnific tree in the diningroom a long and superb
galleri which wa situat on the ground floor and open on the
garden m henri puget had entertain in state on juli 29 1714 my

convalesc
that wa what i said to myself
in case of epidemicsw have had the typhu fever thi year we had
the sweat sick two year ago and a hundr patient at
timesw know not what to do
that is the thought which occur to me
what would you have monseigneur said the director on must resign
on self
thi convers took place in the galleri diningroom on the ground
floor
the bishop remain silent for a moment then he turn abruptli to the
director of the hospit
monsieur said he how mani bed do you think thi hall alon would
hold
monseigneur diningroom exclaim the stupefi director

draw asid to let him pass thei did not know which wa most worthi of
admir hi pallor or hi seren on hi return to the humbl
dwell which he design with a smile as hi palac he said
to hi sister i have just offici pontif
sinc the most sublim thing ar often those which ar the least
understood there were peopl in the town who said when comment on
thi conduct of the bishop it is affect
thi howev wa a remark which wa confin to the drawingroom
the populac which perceiv no jest in holi deed wa touch and
admir him
as for the bishop it wa a shock to him to have beheld the guillotin
and it wa a long time befor he recov from it
in fact when the scaffold is there all erect and prepar it ha
someth about it which produc hallucin on mai feel a certain
indiffer to the death penalti on mai refrain from pronounc
upon it from sai ye or no so long as on ha not seen a
guillotin with on own ey but if on encount on of them the
shock is violent on is forc to decid and to take part for or
against some admir it like de maistr other execr it like
beccaria the guillotin is the concret of the law it is call
vindic it is not neutral and it doe not permit you to remain
neutral he who see it shiver with the most mysteri of shiver
all social problem erect their interrog point around thi
choppingknif the scaffold is a vision the scaffold is not a piec
of carpentri the scaffold is not a machin the scaffold is not an
inert bit of mechan construct of wood iron and cord
it seem as though it were a be possess of i know not what sombr
initi on would sai that thi piec of carpent work saw that
thi machin heard that thi mechan understood that thi wood
thi iron and these cord were possess of will in the fright
medit into which it presenc cast the soul the scaffold appear
in terribl guis and as though take part in what is go on the
scaffold is the accomplic of the execution it devour it eat
flesh it drink blood the scaffold is a sort of monster fabric by
the judg and the carpent a spectr which seem to live with a
horribl vital compos of all the death which it ha inflict
therefor the impress wa terribl and profound on the dai
follow the execut and on mani succeed dai the bishop
appear to be crush the almost violent seren of the funer
moment had disappear the phantom of social justic torment him
he who gener return from all hi deed with a radiant
satisfact seem to be reproach himself at time he talk to
himself and stammer lugubri monologu in a low voic thi is
on which hi sister overheard on even and preserv i did not
think that it wa so monstrou it is wrong to becom absorb in the
divin law to such a degre as not to perceiv human law death belong
to god alon by what right do men touch that unknown thing
in cours of time these impress weaken and probabl vanish
nevertheless it wa observ that the bishop thenceforth avoid
pass the place of execut
m myriel could be summon at ani hour to the bedsid of the sick and
dy he did not ignor the fact that therein lai hi greatest duti
and hi greatest labor widow and orphan famili had no need to

and hold hi peac for long hour besid the man who had lost the wife
of hi love of the mother who had lost her child as he knew the
moment for silenc he knew also the moment for speech oh admir
consol he sought not to effac sorrow by forget but to
magnifi and dignifi it by hope he said
have a care of the manner in which you turn toward the dead think
not of that which perish gaze steadili you will perceiv the live
light of your wellbelov dead in the depth of heaven he knew that
faith is wholesom he sought to counsel and calm the despair man
by point out to him the resign man and to transform the grief
which gaze upon a grave by show him the grief which fix it gaze
upon a star

benefic on the same dai the 27th of april 1785 madam magloir
have taken the pictur down to dust the bishop had discov these
particular written in whitish ink on a littl squar of paper
yellow by time and attach to the back of the portrait of the abb
of grandchamp with four wafer
at hi window he had an antiqu curtain of a coars woollen stuff
which final becam so old that in order to avoid the expens of a
new on madam magloir wa forc to take a larg seam in the veri
middl of it thi seam took the form of a cross the bishop often
call attent to it how delight that is he said
all the room in the hous without except those on the ground
floor as well as those on the first floor were whitewash which is
a fashion in barrack and hospit
howev in their latter year madam magloir discov beneath the
paper which had been wash over paint ornament the apart
of mademoisel baptistin as we shall see further on befor becom
a hospit thi hous had been the ancient parliament hous of the
bourgeoi henc thi decor the chamber were pave in red
brick which were wash everi week with straw mat in front of all
the bed altogeth thi dwell which wa attend to by the two
women wa exquisit clean from top to bottom thi wa the sole
luxuri which the bishop permit he said that take noth from
the poor
it must be confess howev that he still retain from hi former
possess six silver knive and fork and a soupladl which madam
magloir contempl everi dai with delight as thei glisten
splendidli upon the coars linen cloth and sinc we ar now paint
the bishop of d as he wa in realiti we must add that he had said
more than onc i find it difficult to renounc eat from silver
dish
to thi silverwar must be ad two larg candlestick of massiv
silver which he had inherit from a greataunt these candlestick
held two wax candl and usual figur on the bishop
chimneypiec when he had ani on to dinner madam magloir light
the two candl and set the candlestick on the tabl
in the bishop own chamber at the head of hi bed there wa a small
cupboard in which madam magloir lock up the six silver knive and
fork and the big spoon everi night but it is necessari to add that
the kei wa never remov
the garden which had been rather spoil by the ugli build which
we have mention wa compos of four allei in crossform radiat
from a tank anoth walk made the circuit of the garden and skirt
the white wall which enclos it these allei left behind them four
squar plot rim with box in three of these madam magloir
cultiv veget in the fourth the bishop had plant some
flower here and there stood a few fruittre madam magloir had
onc remark with a sort of gentl malic monseigneur you who turn
everyth to account have nevertheless on useless plot it would
be better to grow salad there than bouquet madam magloir
retort the bishop you ar mistaken the beauti is as us as
the us he ad after a paus more so perhap
thi plot consist of three or four bed occupi the bishop almost
as much as did hi book he like to pass an hour or two there
trim hoe and make hole here and there in the earth into
which he drop seed he wa not as hostil to insect as a garden
could have wish to see him moreov he made no pretens to
botani he ignor group and consist he made not the slightest
effort to decid between tournefort and the natur method he took
part neither with the bud against the cotyledon nor with jussieu
against linnu he did not studi plant he love flower he
respect learn men greatli he respect the ignor still more
and without ever fail in these two respect he water hi
flowerb everi summer even with a tin wateringpot paint green
the hous had not a singl door which could be lock the door of the
diningroom which as we have said open directli on the cathedr
squar had formerli been ornament with lock and bolt like the door
of a prison the bishop had had all thi ironwork remov and thi
door wa never fasten either by night or by dai with anyth
except the latch all that the first passerbi had to do at ani hour
wa to give it a push at first the two women had been veri much tri
by thi door which wa never fasten but monsieur de d had said to
them have bolt put on your room if that will pleas you thei had
end by share hi confid or by at least act as though thei
share it madam magloir alon had fright from time to time as for
the bishop hi thought can be found explain or at least indic
in the three line which he wrote on the margin of a bibl thi is
the shade of differ the door of the physician should never be
shut the door of the priest should alwai be open
on anoth book entitl philosophi of the medic scienc he had
written thi other note am not i a physician like them i also have
my patient and then too i have some whom i call my unfortun
again he wrote do not inquir the name of him who ask a shelter of
you the veri man who is embarrass by hi name is the on who need
shelter
it chanc that a worthi cur i know not whether it wa the cur of
couloubroux or the cur of pompierri took it into hi head to ask him
on dai probabl at the instig of madam magloir whether
monsieur wa sure that he wa not commit an indiscret to a
certain extent in leav hi door unfasten dai and night at the
merci of ani on who should choos to enter and whether in short he
did not fear lest some misfortun might occur in a hous so littl
guard the bishop touch hi shoulder with gentl graviti and said
to him nisi dominu custodierit domum in vanum vigil qui
custodiunt eam unless the lord guard the hous in vain do thei watch
who guard it
then he spoke of someth els
he wa fond of sai there is a braveri of the priest as well as the
braveri of a colonel of dragoonsonli he ad our must be
tranquil

and then what would thei sai to a bishop who wa afraid what would
thei sai if i did not go
but the brigand monseigneur
hold said the bishop i must think of that you ar right i mai
meet them thei too need to be told of the good god
but monseigneur there is a band of them a flock of wolv
monsieur le mair it mai be that it is of thi veri flock of wolv
that jesu ha constitut me the shepherd who know the wai of

an old goodman of a priest who pass along mumbl hi prayer
bah to what purpos
oh mon dieu what if you should meet them
i should beg alm of them for my poor
do not go monseigneur in the name of heaven you ar risk your
life
monsieur le mair said the bishop is that realli all i am not in
the world to guard my own life but to guard soul
thei had to allow him to do as he pleas he set out accompani onli
by a child who offer to serv as a guid hi obstinaci wa bruit
about the countrysid and caus great constern
he would take neither hi sister nor madam magloir he travers the
mountain on muleback encount no on and arriv safe and sound
at the resid of hi good friend the shepherd he remain
there for a fortnight preach administ the sacrament
teach exhort when the time of hi departur approach he
resolv to chant a te deum pontif he mention it to the
cur but what wa to be done there were no episcop ornament thei
could onli place at hi dispos a wretch villag sacristi with a
few ancient chasubl of threadbar damask adorn with imit lace
bah said the bishop let us announc our te deum from the pulpit
nevertheless monsieur le cur thing will arrang themselv
thei institut a search in the church of the neighborhood all the
magnific of these humbl parish combin would not have suffic
to cloth the chorist of a cathedr properli
while thei were thu embarrass a larg chest wa brought and
deposit in the presbyteri for the bishop by two unknown horsemen
who depart on the instant the chest wa open it contain a cope
of cloth of gold a mitr ornament with diamond an archbishop
cross a magnific crosieral the pontif vestment which had
been stolen a month previous from the treasuri of notr dame
dembrun in the chest wa a paper on which these word were written
from cravatt to monseigneur bienvenu
did not i sai that thing would come right of themselv said the
bishop then he ad with a smile to him who content himself with
the surplic of a curat god send the cope of an archbishop
monseigneur murmur the cur throw back hi head with a smile
godor the devil
the bishop look steadili at the cur and repeat with author
god
when he return to chastelar the peopl came out to stare at him as
at a curios all along the road at the priest hous in chastelar
he rejoin mademoisel baptistin and madam magloir who were
wait for him and he said to hi sister well wa i in the right
the poor priest went to hi poor mountain with empti hand and he
return from them with hi hand full i set out bear onli my faith
in god i have brought back the treasur of a cathedr
that even befor he went to bed he said again let us never fear
robber nor murder those ar danger from without petti danger
let us fear ourselv prejudic ar the real robber vice ar the
real murder the great danger lie within ourselv what matter it
what threaten our head or our purs let us think onli of that which
threaten our soul
then turn to hi sister sister never a precaut on the part of
the priest against hi fellowman that which hi fellow doe god
permit let us confin ourselv to prayer when we think that a
danger is approach us let us prai not for ourselv but that our
brother mai not fall into sin on our account
howev such incid were rare in hi life we relat those of which
we know but gener he pass hi life in do the same thing at

as to what becam of the treasur of the cathedr of embrun we
should be embarrass by ani inquiri in that direct it consist of
veri handsom thing veri tempt thing and thing which were veri
well adapt to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortun stolen
thei had alreadi been elsewher half of the adventur wa complet
it onli remain to impart a new direct to the theft and to caus
it to take a short trip in the direct of the poor howev we make
no assert on thi point onli a rather obscur note wa found
among the bishop paper which mai bear some relat to thi matter
and which is couch in these term the question is to decid
whether thi should be turn over to the cathedr or to the
hospit

as will be perceiv from thi letter these two women understood how
to mould themselv to the bishop wai with that special feminin
geniu which comprehend the man better than he comprehend himself
the bishop of d in spite of the gentl and candid air which never
desert him sometim did thing that were grand bold and
magnific without seem to have even a suspicion of the fact thei
trembl but thei let him alon sometim madam magloir essai a
remonstr in advanc but never at the time nor afterward thei
never interf with him by so much as a word or sign in ani action
onc enter upon at certain moment without hi have occas to
mention it when he wa not even consciou of it himself in all
probabl so perfect wa hi simplic thei vagu felt that he
wa act as a bishop then thei were noth more than two shadow in
the hous thei serv him passiv and if obedi consist in
disappear thei disappear thei understood with an admir
delicaci of instinct that certain care mai be put under constraint
thu even when believ him to be in peril thei understood i will
not sai hi thought but hi natur to such a degre that thei no
longer watch over him thei confid him to god
moreov baptistin said as we have just read that her brother end
would prove her own madam magloir did not sai thi but she knew it
chapter xthe bishop in the presenc of an unknown light
at an epoch a littl later than the date of the letter cite in the
preced page he did a thing which if the whole town wa to be
believ wa even more hazard than hi trip across the mountain
infest with bandit
in the countri near d a man live quit alon thi man we will
state at onc wa a former member of the convent hi name wa g
member of the convent g wa mention with a sort of horror in
the littl world of d a member of the conventioncan you imagin such
a thing that exist from the time when peopl call each other
thou and when thei said citizen thi man wa almost a monster he
had not vote for the death of the king but almost he wa a
quasiregicid he had been a terribl man how did it happen that such
a man had not been brought befor a provost court on the return of
the legitim princ thei need not have cut off hi head if you
pleas clemenc must be exercis agre but a good banish for
life an exampl in short etc besid he wa an atheist like all
the rest of those peopl gossip of the gees about the vultur
wa g a vultur after all ye if he were to be judg by the
element of feroc in thi solitud of hi as he had not vote for
the death of the king he had not been includ in the decre of
exil and had been abl to remain in franc
he dwelt at a distanc of threequart of an hour from the citi far
from ani hamlet far from ani road in some hidden turn of a veri wild
vallei no on knew exactli where he had there it wa said a sort of
field a hole a lair there were no neighbor not even passersbi
sinc he had dwelt in that vallei the path which led thither had
disappear under a growth of grass the local wa spoken of as
though it had been the dwell of a hangman
nevertheless the bishop medit on the subject and from time to
time he gaze at the horizon at a point where a clump of tree mark
the vallei of the former member of the convent and he said there
is a soul yonder which is lone
and he ad deep in hi own mind i ow him a visit
but let us avow it thi idea which seem natur at the first
blush appear to him after a moment reflect as strang
imposs and almost repuls for at bottom he share the gener
impress and the old member of the convent inspir him without
hi be clearli consciou of the fact himself with that sentiment
which border on hate and which is so well express by the word
estrang
still should the scab of the sheep caus the shepherd to recoil no
but what a sheep
the good bishop wa perplex sometim he set out in that direct
then he return
final the rumor on dai spread through the town that a sort of young
shepherd who serv the member of the convent in hi hovel had
come in quest of a doctor that the old wretch wa dy that
paralysi wa gain on him and that he would not live over
nightthank god some ad
the bishop took hi staff put on hi cloak on account of hi too
threadbar cassock as we have mention and becaus of the even
breez which wa sure to rise soon and set out
the sun wa set and had almost touch the horizon when the bishop
arriv at the excommun spot with a certain beat of the
heart he recogn the fact that he wa near the lair he strode over
a ditch leap a hedg made hi wai through a fenc of dead bough
enter a neglect paddock took a few step with a good deal of
bold and suddenli at the extrem of the wast land and behind
lofti brambl he caught sight of the cavern
it wa a veri low hut poor small and clean with a vine nail
against the outsid
near the door in an old wheelchair the armchair of the peasant
there wa a whitehair man smile at the sun
near the seat man stood a young boi the shepherd lad he wa
offer the old man a jar of milk
while the bishop wa watch him the old man spoke thank you he
said i need noth and hi smile quit the sun to rest upon the
child
the bishop step forward at the sound which he made in walk the
old man turn hi head and hi face express the sum total of the
surpris which a man can still feel after a long life
thi is the first time sinc i have been here said he that ani on
ha enter here who ar you sir
the bishop answer
my name is bienvenu myriel
bienvenu myriel i have heard that name ar you the man whom the

to whom do i speak who ar you
the bishop hung hi head and repli vermi sumi am a worm

it wa the conventionari turn to be arrog and the bishop to be
humbl

off behind the tree yonder how my good tabl and the moorhen which
i eat on fridai how my twentyf thousand franc incom how my

direct of a point of steel the bishop quiver under it no repli
occur to him but he wa offend by thi mode of allud to
bossuet the best of mind will have their fetich and thei sometim
feel vagu wound by the want of respect of logic
the conventionari began to pant the asthma of the agoni which is
mingl with the last breath interrupt hi voic still there wa a
perfect lucid of soul in hi ey he went on
let me sai a few word more in thi and that direct i am will
apart from the revolut which taken as a whole is an immens human
affirm 93 is ala a rejoind you think it inexor sir

human race i abridg i stop i have too much the advantag moreov
i am dy
and ceas to gaze at the bishop the conventionari conclud hi
thought in these tranquil word
ye the brutal of progress ar call revolut when thei ar
over thi fact is recognizedthat the human race ha been treat
harshli but that it ha progress
the conventionari doubt not that he had success conquer all
the inmost intrench of the bishop on remain howev and from
thi intrench the last resourc of monseigneur bienvenu
resist came forth thi repli wherein appear nearli all the
harsh of the begin
progress should believ in god good cannot have an impiou servitor
he who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race
the former repres of the peopl made no repli he wa seiz
with a fit of trembl he look toward heaven and in hi glanc a
tear gather slowli when the eyelid wa full the tear trickl down
hi livid cheek and he said almost in a stammer quit low and to
himself while hi ey were plung in the depth
o thou o ideal thou alon existest
the bishop experienc an indescrib shock
after a paus the old man rais a finger heavenward and said
the infinit is he is there if the infinit had no person person
would be without limit it would not be infinit in other word it
would not exist there is then an i that i of the infinit is
god
the dy man had pronounc these last word in a loud voic and with
the shiver of ecstasi as though he beheld some on when he had
spoken hi ey close the effort had exhaust him it wa evid
that he had just live through in a moment the few hour which had been
left to him that which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in
death the suprem moment wa approach
the bishop understood thi time press it wa as a priest that he
had come from extrem cold he had pass by degre to extrem
emot he gaze at those close ey he took that wrinkl ag and
icecold hand in hi and bent over the dy man
thi hour is the hour of god do you not think that it would be
regrett if we had met in vain
the conventionari open hi ey again a graviti mingl with gloom
wa imprint on hi counten
bishop said he with a slow which probabl aros more from hi
digniti of soul than from the fail of hi strength i have pass
my life in medit studi and contempl i wa sixti year of
ag when my countri call me and command me to concern myself with
it affair i obei abus exist i combat them tyranni

been on of the master of the state the vault of the treasuri were

the wall which were on the point of burst beneath the weight of
gold and silver i dine in dead tree street at twentytwo sou i
have succor the oppress i have comfort the suffer i tore the
cloth from the altar it is true but it wa to bind up the wound of
my countri i have alwai upheld the march forward of the human race
forward toward the light and i have sometim resist progress
without piti i have when the occas offer protect my own
adversari men of your profess and there is at peteghem in
flander at the veri spot where the merovingian king had their summer
palac a convent of urbanist the abbei of saint clair en beaulieu
which i save in 1793 i have done my duti accord to my power and
all the good that i wa abl after which i wa hunt down pursu
persecut blacken jeer at scorn curs proscrib for mani
year past i with my white hair have been consciou that mani peopl

present the visag of on damn and i accept thi isol of
hatr without hate ani on myself now i am eightysix year old i
am on the point of death what is it that you have come to ask of me
your bless said the bishop
and he knelt down
when the bishop rais hi head again the face of the conventionari
had becom august he had just expir
the bishop return home deepli absorb in thought which cannot be
known to us he pass the whole night in prayer on the follow
morn some bold and curiou person attempt to speak to him about
member of the convent g he content himself with point
heavenward
from that moment he redoubl hi tender and brotherli feel
toward all children and suffer
ani allus to that old wretch of a g caus him to fall into a
singular preoccup no on could sai that the passag of that soul
befor hi and the reflect of that grand conscienc upon hi did
not count for someth in hi approach to perfect
thi pastor visit natur furnish an occas for a murmur of
comment in all the littl local coteri
wa the bedsid of such a dy man as that the proper place for a
bishop there wa evid no convers to be expect all those
revolutionist ar backslid then why go there what wa there to be
seen there he must have been veri curiou inde to see a soul carri
off by the devil
on dai a dowag of the impertin varieti who think herself
spiritu address thi salli to him monseigneur peopl ar
inquir when your great will receiv the red capoh oh
that a coars color repli the bishop it is lucki that those who
despis it in a cap rever it in a hat
chapter xia restrict
we should incur a great risk of deceiv ourselv were we to
conclud from thi that monseigneur welcom wa a philosoph
bishop or a patriot cur hi meet which mai almost be
design as hi union with conventionari g left behind it in hi
mind a sort of astonish which render him still more gentl that
is all
although monseigneur bienvenu wa far from be a politician thi is
perhap the place to indic veri briefli what hi attitud wa in
the event of that epoch suppos that monseigneur bienvenu ever
dream of have an attitud
let us then go back a few year
some time after the elev of m myriel to the episcop the
emperor had made him a baron of the empir in compani with mani other
bishop the arrest of the pope took place as everi on know on the
night of the 5th to the 6th of juli 1809 on thi occas m myriel
wa summon by napoleon to the synod of the bishop of franc and
itali conven at pari thi synod wa held at notredam and
assembl for the first time on the 15th of june 1811 under the
presid of cardin fesch m myriel wa on of the ninetyf
bishop who attend it but he wa present onli at on sit and at
three or four privat confer bishop of a mountain dioces live
so veri close to natur in rustic and depriv it appear that
he import among these emin personag idea which alter the
temperatur of the assembl he veri soon return to d he wa
interrog as to thi speedi return and he repli i embarrass
them the outsid air penetr to them through me i produc on them
the effect of an open door
on anoth occas he said what would you have those gentlemen ar
princ i am onli a poor peasant bishop
the fact is that he displeas them among other strang thing it is
said that he chanc to remark on even when he found himself at
the hous of on of hi most notabl colleagu what beauti
clock what beauti carpet what beauti liveri thei must be a
great troubl i would not have all those superflu cry
incessantli in my ear there ar peopl who ar hungri there ar
peopl who ar cold there ar poor peopl there ar poor peopl
let us remark by the wai that the hatr of luxuri is not an
intellig hatr thi hatr would involv the hatr of the art
nevertheless in churchmen luxuri is wrong except in connect with
represent and ceremoni it seem to reveal habit which have
veri littl that is charit about them an opul priest is a
contradict the priest must keep close to the poor now can on
come in contact incessantli night and dai with all thi distress all
these misfortun and thi poverti without have about on own
person a littl of that miseri like the dust of labor is it possibl
to imagin a man near a brazier who is not warm can on imagin a
workman who is work near a furnac and who ha neither a sing
hair nor blacken nail nor a drop of sweat nor a speck of ash on
hi face the first proof of chariti in the priest in the bishop
especi is poverti
thi is no doubt what the bishop of d thought
it must not be suppos howev that he share what we call the
idea of the centuri on certain delic point he took veri littl
part in the theolog quarrel of the moment and maintain silenc
on question in which church and state were implic but if he had
been strongli press it seem that he would have been found to be an
ultramontan rather than a gallican sinc we ar make a portrait
and sinc we do not wish to conceal anyth we ar forc to add that
he wa glacial toward napoleon in hi declin begin with 1813 he
gave in hi adher to or applaud all hostil manifest he
refus to see him as he pass through on hi return from the island
of elba and he abstain from order public prayer for the emperor
in hi dioces dure the hundr dai
besid hi sister mademoisel baptistin he had two brother on a
gener the other a prefect he wrote to both with toler
frequenc he wa harsh for a time toward the former becaus hold
a command in provenc at the epoch of the disembark at cann the
gener had put himself at the head of twelv hundr men and had
pursu the emperor as though the latter had been a person whom on is
desir of allow to escap hi correspond with the other
brother the exprefect a fine worthi man who live in retir at
pari rue cassett remain more affection
thu monseigneur bienvenu also had hi hour of parti spirit hi hour
of bitter hi cloud the shadow of the passion of the moment
travers thi grand and gentl spirit occupi with etern thing
certainli such a man would have done well not to entertain ani
polit opinion let there be no mistak as to our mean we ar
not confound what is call polit opinion with the grand
aspir for progress with the sublim faith patriot democrat
human which in our dai should be the veri foundat of everi
gener intellect without go deepli into question which ar onli
indirectli connect with the subject of thi book we will simpli sai
thi it would have been well if monseigneur bienvenu had not been a
royalist and if hi glanc had never been for a singl instant
turn awai from that seren contempl in which is distinctli
discern abov the fiction and the hatr of thi world abov
the stormi vicissitud of human thing the beam of those three
pure radianc truth justic and chariti
while admit that it wa not for a polit offic that god creat
monseigneur welcom we should have understood and admir hi protest
in the name of right and liberti hi proud opposit hi just but
peril resist to the allpow napoleon but that which
pleas us in peopl who ar rise pleas us less in the case of
peopl who ar fall we onli love the frai so long as there is
danger and in ani case the combat of the first hour have alon
the right to be the extermin of the last he who ha not been a
stubborn accus in prosper should hold hi peac in the face of
ruin the denunci of success is the onli legitim execution of
the fall as for us when provid interven and strike we let it
work 1812 commenc to disarm us in 1813 the cowardli breach of
silenc of that taciturn legisl bodi embolden by catastroph
possess onli trait which arous indign and it wa a crime to
applaud in 1814 in the presenc of those marshal who betrai in
the presenc of that senat which pass from on dunghil to anoth
insult after have deifi in the presenc of that idolatri which
wa loos it foot and spit on it idolit wa a duti to turn
asid the head in 1815 when the suprem disast fill the air
when franc wa seiz with a shiver at their sinist approach when
waterloo could be dimli discern open befor napoleon the mourn
acclam of the armi and the peopl to the condemn of destini had
noth laughabl in it and after make all allow for the
despot a heart like that of the bishop of d ought not perhap to
have fail to recogn the august and touch featur present by
the embrac of a great nation and a great man on the brink of the
abyss
with thi except he wa in all thing just true equit
intellig humbl and dignifi benefic and kindli which is onli
anoth sort of benevol he wa a priest a sage and a man it
must be admit that even in the polit view with which we have
just reproach him and which we ar dispos to judg almost with
sever he wa toler and easi more so perhap than we who ar
speak here the porter of the townhal had been place there by the
emperor he wa an old noncommiss offic of the old guard a
member of the legion of honor at austerlitz as much of a bonapartist
as the eagl thi poor fellow occasion let slip inconsider
remark which the law then stigmat as sediti speech after
the imperi profil disappear from the legion of honor he never
dress himself in hi regiment as he said so that he should not
be oblig to wear hi cross he had himself devoutli remov the
imperi effigi from the cross which napoleon had given him thi made
a hole and he would not put anyth in it place i will die he
said rather than wear the three frog upon my heart he like to
scoff aloud at loui xviii the gouti old creatur in english
gaiter he said let him take himself off to prussia with that
queue of hi he wa happi to combin in the same imprec the two
thing which he most detest prussia and england he did it so often
that he lost hi place there he wa turn out of the hous with hi
wife and children and without bread the bishop sent for him reprov
him gentli and appoint him beadl in the cathedr
in the cours of nine year monseigneur bienvenu had by dint of holi
deed and gentl manner fill the town of dwith a sort of tender
and filial rever even hi conduct toward napoleon had been
accept and tacitli pardon as it were by the peopl the good and
weakli flock who ador their emperor but love their bishop

chapter xiiiwhat he believ
we ar not oblig to sound the bishop of d on the score of
orthodoxi in the presenc of such a soul we feel ourselv in no mood
but respect the conscienc of the just man should be accept on hi
word moreov certain natur be given we admit the possibl
develop of all beauti of human virtu in a belief that differ
from our own
what did he think of thi dogma or of that mysteri these secret of
the inner tribun of the conscienc ar known onli to the tomb where
soul enter nake the point on which we ar certain is that the
difficulti of faith never resolv themselv into hypocrisi in hi
case no decai is possibl to the diamond he believ to the extent of
hi power credo in patrem he often exclaim moreov he drew
from good work that amount of satisfact which suffic to the
conscienc and which whisper to a man thou art with god
the point which we consid it our duti to note is that outsid of and
beyond hi faith as it were the bishop possess an excess of love
it wa in that quarter quia multum amavitbecaus he love
muchthat he wa regard as vulner by seriou men grave
person and reason peopl favorit locut of our sad world
where egot take it word of command from pedantri what wa thi
excess of love it wa a seren benevol which overflow men as we
have alreadi point out and which on occas extend even to
thing he live without disdain he wa indulg toward god
creation everi man even the best ha within him a thoughtless
harsh which he reserv for anim the bishop of d had none of
that harsh which is peculiar to mani priest nevertheless he did
not go as far as the brahmin but he seem to have weigh thi sai
of ecclesiast who knoweth whither the soul of the anim goeth
hideous of aspect deform of instinct troubl him not and did
not arous hi indign he wa touch almost soften by them it
seem as though he went thoughtfulli awai to seek beyond the bound of
life which is appar the caus the explan or the excus for
them he seem at time to be ask god to commut these penalti
he examin without wrath and with the ey of a linguist who is
deciph a palimpsest that portion of chao which still exist in
natur thi reveri sometim caus him to utter odd sai on
morn he wa in hi garden and thought himself alon but hi sister
wa walk behind him unseen by him suddenli he paus and gaze at
someth on the ground it wa a larg black hairi fright
spider hi sister heard him sai
poor beast it is not it fault
why not mention these almost divin childish sai of kind
pueril thei mai be but these sublim pueril were peculiar to
saint franci dassisi and of marcu aureliu on dai he sprain hi
ankl in hi effort to avoid step on an ant thu live thi just
man sometim he fell asleep in hi garden and then there wa noth
more vener possibl
monseigneur bienvenu had formerli been if the stori anent hi youth
and even in regard to hi manhood were to be believ a passion
and possibl a violent man hi univers suaviti wa less an
instinct of natur than the result of a grand convict which had
filter into hi heart through the medium of life and had trickl
there slowli thought by thought for in a charact as in a rock
there mai exist apertur made by drop of water these hollow ar
uneffac these format ar indestruct
in 1815 as we think we have alreadi said he reach hi seventyfifth
birthdai but he did not appear to be more than sixti he wa not tall
he wa rather plump and in order to combat thi tendenc he wa fond
of take long stroll on foot hi step wa firm and hi form wa but
slightli bent a detail from which we do not pretend to draw ani
conclus gregori xvi at the ag of eighti held himself erect and
smile which did not prevent him from be a bad bishop monseigneur
welcom had what the peopl term a fine head but so amiabl wa he
that thei forgot that it wa fine
when he convers with that infantil gayeti which wa on of hi
charm and of which we have alreadi spoken peopl felt at their eas
with him and joi seem to radiat from hi whole person hi fresh
and ruddi complexion hi veri white teeth all of which he had
preserv and which were displai by hi smile gave him that open
and easi air which caus the remark to be made of a man he a good
fellow and of an old man he is a fine man that it will be
recal wa the effect which he produc upon napoleon on the first
encount and to on who saw him for the first time he wa noth
in fact but a fine man but if on remain near him for a few hour
and beheld him in the least degre pensiv the fine man becam
gradual transfigur and took on some impos qualiti i know not
what hi broad and seriou brow render august by hi white lock
becam august also by virtu of medit majesti radiat from hi
good though hi good ceas not to be radiant on experienc
someth of the emot which on would feel on behold a smile
angel slowli unfold hi wing without ceas to smile respect an
unutter respect penetr you by degre and mount to your
heart and on felt that on had befor him on of those strong
thoroughli tri and indulg soul where thought is so grand that it
can no longer be anyth but gentl
as we have seen prayer the celebr of the offic of religion
almsgiv the consol of the afflict the cultiv of a bit
of land fratern frugal hospit renunci confid
studi work fill everi dai of hi life fill is exactli the
word certainli the bishop dai wa quit full to the brim of good
word and good deed nevertheless it wa not complet if cold or
raini weather prevent hi pass an hour or two in hi garden befor
go to bed and after the two women had retir it seem to be a
sort of rite with him to prepar himself for slumber by medit in
the presenc of the grand spectacl of the nocturn heaven
sometim if the two old women were not asleep thei heard him pace
slowli along the walk at a veri advanc hour of the night he wa
there alon commun with himself peac ador compar the
seren of hi heart with the seren of the ether move amid the
dark by the visibl splendor of the constel and the
invis splendor of god open hi heart to the thought which fall
from the unknown at such moment while he offer hi heart at the
hour when nocturn flower offer their perfum illumin like a
lamp amid the starri night as he pour himself out in ecstasi in the
midst of the univers radianc of creation he could not have told
himself probabl what wa pass in hi spirit he felt someth
take it flight from him and someth descend into him mysteri
exchang of the abyss of the soul with the abyss of the univers
he thought of the grandeur and presenc of god of the futur etern
that strang mysteri of the etern past a mysteri still more
strang of all the infin which pierc their wai into all hi
sens beneath hi ey and without seek to comprehend the
incomprehens he gaze upon it he did not studi god he wa
dazzl by him he consid those magnific conjunct of atom
which commun aspect to matter reveal forc by verifi them
creat individu in uniti proport in extent the innumer
in the infinit and through light produc beauti these conjunct
ar form and dissolv incessantli henc life and death
he seat himself on a wooden bench with hi back against a decrepit
vine he gaze at the star past the puni and stunt silhouett of
hi fruittre thi quarter of an acr so poorli plant so
encumb with mean build and shed wa dear to him and
satisfi hi want
what more wa need by thi old man who divid the leisur of hi
life where there wa so littl leisur between garden in the
daytim and contempl at night wa not thi narrow enclosur with
the heaven for a ceil suffici to enabl him to ador god in hi
most divin work in turn doe not thi comprehend all in fact and
what is there left to desir beyond it a littl garden in which to
walk and immens in which to dream at on feet that which can be
cultiv and pluck over head that which on can studi and medit
upon some flower on earth and all the star in the sky
chapter xivwhat he thought
on last word
sinc thi sort of detail might particularli at the present moment
and to us an express now in fashion give to the bishop of d a
certain pantheist physiognomi and induc the belief either to
hi credit or discredit that he entertain on of those person
philosophi which ar peculiar to our centuri which sometim spring
up in solitari spirit and there take on a form and grow until thei
usurp the place of religion we insist upon it that not on of those
person who knew monseigneur welcom would have thought himself
author to think anyth of the sort that which enlighten thi
man wa hi heart hi wisdom wa made of the light which come from
there
no system mani work abstrus specul contain vertigo no
there is noth to indic that he risk hi mind in apocalyps
the apostl mai be dare but the bishop must be timid he would
probabl have felt a scrupl at sound too far in advanc certain
problem which ar in a manner reserv for terribl great mind
there is a sacr horror beneath the porch of the enigma those
gloomi open stand yawn there but someth tell you you a
passerbi in life that you must not enter woe to him who penetr
thither
genius in the impenetr depth of abstract and pure
specul situat so to speak abov all dogma propos their
idea to god their prayer audaci offer discuss their
ador interrog thi is direct religion which is full of
anxieti and respons for him who attempt it steep cliff
human medit ha no limit at hi own risk and peril it analyz
and dig deep into it own bedazzl on might almost sai that by
a sort of splendid reaction it with it dazzl natur the mysteri
world which surround us render back what it ha receiv it is
probabl that the contempl ar contempl howev that mai be
there ar on earth men whoar thei menperc distinctli at the
verg of the horizon of reveri the height of the absolut and who
have the terribl vision of the infinit mountain monseigneur welcom
wa on of these men monseigneur welcom wa not a geniu he would
have fear those sublim whenc some veri great men even like
swedenborg and pascal have slip into insan certainli these
power reveri have their moral util and by these arduou path
on approach to ideal perfect as for him he took the path which
shortensth gospel
he did not attempt to impart to hi chasubl the fold of elijah
mantl he project no rai of futur upon the dark groundswel of
event he did not see to condens in flame the light of thing he had
noth of the prophet and noth of the magician about him thi
humbl soul love and that wa all
that he carri prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspir is
probabl but on can no more prai too much than on can love too much
and if it is a heresi to prai beyond the text saint theresa and saint
jerom would be heret
he inclin toward all that groan and all that expiat the univers
appear to him like an immens maladi everywher he felt fever
everywher he heard the sound of suffer and without seek to
solv the enigma he strove to dress the wound the terribl spectacl

priest a perman subject of sad which sought consol
there ar men who toil at extract gold he toil at the extract
of piti univers miseri wa hi mine the sad which reign
everywher wa but an excus for unfail kind love each other
he declar thi to be complet desir noth further and that wa
the whole of hi doctrin on dai that man who believ himself to be
a philosoph the senat who ha alreadi been allud to said to
the bishop just survei the spectacl of the world all war against

nonsensewel repli monseigneur welcom without contest
the point if it is nonsens the soul should shut itself up in it
as the pearl in the oyster thu he shut himself up he live there
he wa absolut satisfi with it leav on on side the prodigi

wait for him shut hi book rose from hi tabl and enter the
diningroom
the diningroom wa an oblong apart with a fireplac which had a
door open on the street as we have said and a window open on
the garden
madam magloir wa in fact just put the last touch to the
tabl
as she perform thi servic she wa convers with mademoisel
baptistin
a lamp stood on the tabl the tabl wa near the fireplac a wood

crab and imperi look so long as monseigneur held hi peac she
talk to him resolut with a mixtur of respect and freedom but as
soon as monseigneur began to speak as we have seen she obei
passiv like her mistress mademoisel baptistin did not even

who still recal the most minut detail
at the moment when the bishop enter madam magloir wa talk with
consider vivac she wa harangu mademoisel baptistin on a
subject which wa familiar to her and to which the bishop wa also
accustom the question concern the lock upon the entranc door
it appear that while procur some provis for supper madam

thi willing to interrog encourag madam magloir it seem
to her to indic that the bishop wa on the point of becom

in the meantim madam magloir had serv supper soup made with
water oil bread and salt a littl bacon a bit of mutton fig a
fresh chees and a larg loaf of rye bread she had of her own
accord ad to the bishop ordinari fare a bottl of hi old mauv

the bishop face at onc assum that express of gayeti which is
peculiar to hospit natur to tabl he cri vivaci as

took her seat at hi left
the bishop ask a bless then help the soup himself accord to
hi custom the man began to eat with avid
all at onc the bishop said it strike me there is someth miss
on thi tabl
madam magloir had in fact onli place the three set of fork and
spoon which were absolut necessari now it wa the usag of the
hous when the bishop had ani on to supper to lai out the whole six
set of silver on the tableclothan innoc ostent thi
grace semblanc of luxuri wa a kind of child plai which wa full
of charm in that gentl and sever household which rais poverti into
digniti
madam magloir understood the remark went out without sai a word
and a moment later the three set of silver fork and spoon demand
by the bishop were glitter upon the cloth symmetr arrang
befor the three person seat at the tabl
chapter ivdetail concern the cheesedairi of pontarli
now in order to convei an idea of what pass at that tabl we cannot
do better than to transcrib here a passag from on of mademoisel
baptistin letter to madam boischevron wherein the convers
between the convict and the bishop is describ with ingeni
minut
thi man paid no attent to ani on he at with the vorac
of a starv man howev after supper he said
monsieur le cur of the good god all thi is far too good for me
but i must sai that the carter who would not allow me to eat with them
keep a better tabl than you do
between ourselv the remark rather shock me my brother repli
thei ar more fatigu than i
no return the man thei have more monei you ar poor i see
that plainli you cannot be even a curat ar you realli a cur ah
if the good god were but just you certainli ought to be a cur
the good god is more than just said my brother
a moment later he ad
monsieur jean valjean is it to pontarli that you ar go
with my road mark out for me
i think that is what the man said then he went on
i must be on my wai by daybreak tomorrow travel is hard if the
night ar cold the dai ar hot
you ar go to a good countri said my brother dure the
revolut my famili wa ruin i took refug in franchecomt at
first and there i live for some time by the toil of my hand my will
wa good i found plenti to occupi me on ha onli to choos there
ar paper mill tanneri distilleri oil factori watch
factori on a larg scale steel mill copper work twenti iron
foundri at least four of which situat at lod at chtillon at
audincourt and at beur ar toler larg
i think i am not mistaken in sai that those ar the name which my
brother mention then he interrupt himself and address me
have we not some rel in those part my dear sister
i repli
we did have some among other m de lucenet who wa captain of the
gate at pontarli under the old rgime
ye resum my brother but in 93 on had no longer ani
rel on had onli on arm i work thei have in the countri
of pontarli whither you ar go monsieur valjean a truli
patriarch and truli charm industri my sister it is their
cheesedairi which thei call fruitir
then my brother while urg the man to eat explain to him with
great minut what these fruitir of pontarli were that thei
were divid into two class the big barn which belong to the
rich and where there ar forti or fifti cow which produc from seven
to eight thousand chees each summer and the associ fruitir
which belong to the poor these ar the peasant of midmountain who
hold their cow in common and share the proce thei engag the
servic of a cheesemak whom thei call the grurin the grurin
receiv the milk of the associ three time a dai and mark the
quantiti on a doubl talli it is toward the end of april that the
work of the cheesedairi begin it is toward the middl of june
that the cheesemak drive their cow to the mountain
the man recov hi anim as he at my brother made him drink
that good mauv wine which he doe not drink himself becaus he sai
that wine is expens my brother impart all these detail with that
easi gayeti of hi with which you ar acquaint interspers hi
word with grace attent to me he recur frequent to that
comfort trade of grurin as though he wish the man to
understand without advis him directli and harshli that thi would
afford him a refug on thing struck me thi man wa what i have told
you well neither dure supper nor dure the entir even did my
brother utter a singl word with the except of a few word about
jesu when he enter which could remind the man of what he wa nor
of what my brother wa to all appear it wa an occas for
preach him a littl sermon and of impress the bishop on the
convict so that a mark of the passag might remain behind thi might
have appear to ani on els who had thi unfortun man in hi
hand to afford a chanc to nourish hi soul as well as hi bodi and
to bestow upon him some reproach season with moral and advic
or a littl commiser with an exhort to conduct himself
better in the futur my brother did not even ask him from what countri
he came nor what wa hi histori for in hi histori there is a fault
and my brother seem to avoid everyth which could remind him of it
to such a point did he carri it that at on time when my brother wa
speak of the mountain of pontarli who exercis a gentl
labor near heaven and who he ad ar happi becaus thei ar
innoc he stop short fear lest in thi remark there might
have escap him someth which might wound the man by dint of
reflect i think i have comprehend what wa pass in my
brother heart he wa think no doubt that thi man whose name
is jean valjean had hi misfortun onli too vividli present in hi
mind that the best thing wa to divert him from it and to make him
believ if onli momentarili that he wa a person like ani other by
treat him just in hi ordinari wai is not thi inde to
understand chariti well is there not dear madam someth truli
evangel in thi delicaci which abstain from sermon from
moral from allus and is not the truest piti when a man ha
a sore point not to touch it at all it ha seem to me that thi
might have been my brother privat thought in ani case what i can
sai is that if he entertain all these idea he gave no sign of
them from begin to end even to me he wa the same as he is everi
even and he sup with thi jean valjean with the same air and in
the same manner in which he would have sup with m gdon le
prvost or with the curat of the parish
toward the end when he had reach the fig there came a knock at
the door it wa mother gerbaud with her littl on in her arm my
brother kiss the child on the brow and borrow fifteen sou which i
had about me to give to mother gerbaud the man wa not pai much
heed to anyth then he wa no longer talk and he seem veri
much fatigu after poor old gerbaud had taken her departur my
brother said grace then he turn to the man and said to him you
must be in great need of your bed madam magloir clear the tabl
veri promptli i understood that we must retir in order to allow thi
travel to go to sleep and we both went upstair nevertheless i
sent madam magloir down a moment later to carri to the man bed a
goat skin from the black forest which wa in my room the night ar
frigid and that keep on warm it is a piti that thi skin is old
all the hair is fall out my brother bought it while he wa in
germani at tottlingen near the sourc of the danub as well as the
littl ivoryhandl knife which i us at tabl
madam magloir return immedi we said our prayer in the
drawingroom where we hang up the linen and then we each retir to
our own chamber without sai a word to each other
chapter vtranquil
after bid hi sister good night monseigneur bienvenu took on of
the two silver candlestick from the tabl hand the other to hi
guest and said to him
monsieur i will conduct you to your room
the man follow him
as might have been observ from what ha been said abov the hous
wa so arrang that in order to pass into the oratori where the alcov
wa situat or to get out of it it wa necessari to travers the
bishop bedroom
at the moment when he wa cross thi apart madam magloir wa
put awai the silverwar in the cupboard near the head of the bed
thi wa her last care everi even befor she went to bed
the bishop instal hi guest in the alcov a fresh white bed had
been prepar there the man set the candl down on a small tabl
well said the bishop mai you pass a good night tomorrow morn
befor you set out you shall drink a cup of warm milk from our cow
thank monsieur labb said the man
hardli had he pronounc these word full of peac when all of a
sudden and without transit he made a strang movement which would
have frozen the two saint women with horror had thei wit it
even at thi dai it is difficult for us to explain what inspir him at
that moment did he intend to convei a warn or to throw out a
menac wa he simpli obei a sort of instinct impuls which wa
obscur even to himself he turn abruptli to the old man fold hi
arm and bend upon hi host a savag gaze he exclaim in a hoars
voic
ah realli you lodg me in your hous close to yourself like thi
he broke off and ad with a laugh in which there lurk someth
monstrou
have you realli reflect well how do you know that i have not been
an assassin
the bishop repli
that is the concern of the good god
then grave and move hi lip like on who is prai or talk to
himself he rais two finger of hi right hand and bestow hi
benedict on the man who did not bow and without turn hi head
or look behind him he return to hi bedroom
when the alcov wa in us a larg serg curtain drawn from wall to
wall conceal the altar the bishop knelt befor thi curtain as he
pass and said a brief prayer a moment later he wa in hi garden
walk medit contempl hi heart and soul wholli absorb
in those grand and mysteri thing which god show at night to the

himself forgot them in that heart where there had been a wound there
wa a scar that is all onli onc dure all the time which he spent
at toulon did he hear hi sister mention thi happen i think
toward the end of the fourth year of hi captiv i know not through

for the school to open for an houron hour of a winter night in the

thei talk to him about it for on dai it wa a moment a flash as
though a window had suddenli been open upon the destini of those
thing whom he had love then all close again he heard noth more

of absenc three year for those four hour nineteen year in
octob 1815 he wa releas he had enter there in 1796 for
have broken a pane of glass and taken a loaf of bread
room for a brief parenthesi thi is the second time dure hi
studi on the penal question and damnat by law that the author of
thi book ha come across the theft of a loaf of bread as the point of
departur for the disast of a destini claud gaux had stolen a loaf
jean valjean had stolen a loaf english statist prove the fact that
four theft out of five in london have hunger for their immedi
caus
jean valjean had enter the gallei sob and shudder he emerg
impass he had enter in despair he emerg gloomi
what had taken place in that soul
chapter viith interior of despair
let us try to sai it
it is necessari that societi should look at these thing becaus it is
itself which creat them
he wa as we have said an ignor man but he wa not a fool the
light of natur wa ignit in him unhappi which also possess a
clear of vision of it own augment the small amount of daylight
which exist in thi mind beneath the cudgel beneath the chain in
the cell in hardship beneath the burn sun of the gallei upon the
plank bed of the convict he withdrew into hi own conscious and
medit
he constitut himself the tribun
he began by put himself on trial
he recogn the fact that he wa not an innoc man unjustli
punish he admit that he had commit an extrem and blameworthi
act that that loaf of bread would probabl not have been refus to
him had he ask for it that in ani case it would have been better
to wait until he could get it through compass or through work that
it is not an unanswer argument to sai can on wait when on is
hungri that in the first place it is veri rare for ani on to die
of hunger liter and next that fortun or unfortun man
is so constitut that he can suffer long and much both moral and
physic without dy that it is therefor necessari to have
patienc that that would even have been better for those poor littl
children that it had been an act of mad for him a miser
unfortun wretch to take societi at larg violent by the collar
and to imagin that on can escap from miseri through theft that that
is in ani case a poor door through which to escap from miseri through
which infami enter in short that he wa in the wrong
then he ask himself
whether he had been the onli on in fault in hi fatal histori whether
it wa not a seriou thing that he a labor out of work that he
an industri man should have lack bread and whether the fault
onc commit and confess the chastis had not been feroci
and disproport whether there had not been more abus on the part
of the law in respect to the penalti than there had been on the part
of the culprit in respect to hi fault whether there had not been an
excess of weight in on balanc of the scale in the on which
contain expiat whether the overweight of the penalti wa not
equival to the annihil of the crime and did not result in
revers the situat of replac the fault of the delinqu by
the fault of the repress of convert the guilti man into the
victim and the debtor into the creditor and of rang the law
definit on the side of the man who had violat it
whether thi penalti complic by success aggrav for
attempt at escap had not end in becom a sort of outrag
perpetr by the stronger upon the feebler a crime of societi
against the individu a crime which wa be commit afresh everi
dai a crime which had last nineteen year
he ask himself whether human societi could have the right to forc
it member to suffer equal in on case for it own unreason lack
of foresight and in the other case for it pitiless foresight and to
seiz a poor man forev between a defect and an excess a default of
work and an excess of punish
whether it wa not outrag for societi to treat thu precis those
of it member who were the least well endow in the divis of good
made by chanc and consequ the most deserv of consider
these question put and answer he judg societi and condemn it
he condemn it to hi hatr
he made it respons for the fate which he wa suffer and he said
to himself that it might be that on dai he should not hesit to call
it to account he declar to himself that there wa no equilibrium
between the harm which he had caus and the harm which wa be done
to him he final arriv at the conclus that hi punish wa
not in truth unjust but that it most assuredli wa iniquit
anger mai be both foolish and absurd on can be irrit wrongfulli
on is exasper onli when there is some show of right on on side
at bottom jean valjean felt himself exasper
and besid human societi had done him noth but harm he had never
seen anyth of it save that angri face which it call justic and
which it show to those whom it strike men had onli touch him to
bruis him everi contact with them had been a blow never sinc hi
infanc sinc the dai of hi mother of hi sister had he ever
encount a friendli word and a kindli glanc from suffer to
suffer he had gradual arriv at the convict that life is a
war and that in thi war he wa the conquer he had no other weapon
than hi hate he resolv to whet it in the gallei and to bear it
awai with him when he depart
there wa at toulon a school for the convict kept by the ignorantin
friar where the most necessari branch were taught to those of the
unfortun men who had a mind for them he wa of the number who had a
mind he went to school at the ag of forti and learn to read to
write to cipher he felt that to fortifi hi intellig wa to
fortifi hi hate in certain case educ and enlighten can
serv to ek out evil
thi is a sad thing to sai after have judg societi which had
caus hi unhappi he judg provid which had made societi
and he condemn it also
thu dure nineteen year of tortur and slaveri thi soul mount
and at the same time fell light enter it on on side and dark
on the other
jean valjean had not as we have seen an evil natur he wa still
good when he arriv at the gallei he there condemn societi and
felt that he wa becom wick he there condemn provid and
wa consciou that he wa becom impiou
it is difficult not to indulg in medit at thi point
doe human natur thu chang utterli and from top to bottom can the
man creat good by god be render wick by man can the soul be
complet made over by fate and becom evil fate be evil can the
heart becom misshapen and contract incur deform and
infirm under the oppress of a disproportion unhappi as
the vertebr column beneath too low a vault is there not in everi
human soul wa there not in the soul of jean valjean in particular a
first spark a divin element incorrupt in thi world immort in
the other which good can develop fan ignit and make to glow with
splendor and which evil can never wholli extinguish
grave and obscur question to the last of which everi physiologist
would probabl have respond no and that without hesit had he
beheld at toulon dure the hour of repos which were for jean
valjean hour of reveri thi gloomi galleyslav seat with fold
arm upon the bar of some capstan with the end of hi chain thrust
into hi pocket to prevent it drag seriou silent and
thought a pariah of the law which regard the man with wrath
condemn by civil and regard heaven with sever
certainlyand we make no attempt to dissimul the factth
observ physiologist would have beheld an irremedi miseri he
would perchanc have piti thi sick man of the law make but
he would not have even essai ani treatment he would have turn
asid hi gaze from the cavern of which he would have caught a glimps
within thi soul and like dant at the portal of hell he would have
effac from thi exist the word which the finger of god ha
nevertheless inscrib upon the brow of everi manhop
wa thi state of hi soul which we have attempt to analyz as
perfectli clear to jean valjean as we have tri to render it for those
who read us did jean valjean distinctli perceiv after their
format and had he seen distinctli dure the process of their
format all the element of which hi moral miseri wa compos had
thi rough and unlett man gather a perfectli clear percept of
the success of idea through which he had by degre mount and
descend to the lugubri aspect which had for so mani year
form the inner horizon of hi spirit wa he consciou of all that
pass within him and of all that wa work there that is someth
which we do not presum to state it is someth which we do not even
believ there wa too much ignor in jean valjean even after hi
misfortun to prevent much vagu from still linger there at
time he did not rightli know himself what he felt jean valjean wa in
the shadow he suffer in the shadow he hate in the shadow on
might have said that he hate in advanc of himself he dwelt
habitu in thi shadow feel hi wai like a blind man and a
dreamer onli at interv there suddenli came to him from without
and from within an access of wrath a surcharg of suffer a livid
and rapid flash which illumin hi whole soul and caus to appear
abruptli all around him in front behind amid the gleam of a
fright light the hideou precipic and the sombr perspect of
hi destini
the flash pass the night close in again and where wa he he no
longer knew the peculiar of pain of thi natur in which that
which is pitilessthat is to sai that which is
brutalizingpredomin is to transform a man littl by littl by a
sort of stupid transfigur into a wild beast sometim into a
feroci beast
jean valjean success and obstin attempt at escap would alon
suffic to prove thi strang work of the law upon the human soul
jean valjean would have renew these attempt utterli useless and
foolish as thei were as often as the opportun had present itself
without reflect for an instant on the result nor on the experi
which he had alreadi gone through he escap impetu like the
wolf who find hi cage open instinct said to him flee reason
would have said remain but in the presenc of so violent a
temptat reason vanish noth remain but instinct the beast
alon act when he wa recaptur the fresh sever inflict on
him onli serv to render him still more wild
on detail which we must not omit is that he possess a physic
strength which wa not approach by a singl on of the denizen of
the gallei at work at pai out a cabl or wind up a capstan
jean valjean wa worth four men he sometim lift and sustain
enorm weight on hi back and when the occas demand it he
replac that implement which is call a jackscrew and wa formerli

requir to wring from him onc or twice a year that lugubri laugh
of the convict which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon to all
appear he seem to be occupi in the constant contempl of
someth terribl

in thi situat jean valjean medit and what could be the natur
of hi medit
if the grain of millet beneath the millston had thought it would
doubtless think that same thing which jean valjean thought
all these thing realiti full of spectr phantasmagori full of
realiti had eventu creat for him a sort of interior state
which is almost indescrib
at time amid hi convict toil he paus he fell to think hi
reason at on and the same time riper and more troubl than of yore
rose in revolt everyth which had happen to him seem to him
absurd everyth that surround him seem to him imposs he
said to himself it is a dream he gaze at the galleyserg

to sum up in conclus that which can be sum up and translat
into posit result in all that we have just point out we will
confin ourselv to the statement that in the cours of nineteen
year jean valjean the inoffens treeprun of faverol the
formid convict of toulon had becom capabl thank to the manner
in which the gallei had mould him of two sort of evil action
firstli of evil action which wa rapid unpremedit dash

which if it be not arrest in it develop by some providenti
incid becom within a given time the hatr of societi then the
hatr of the human race then the hatr of creation and which
manifest itself by a vagu incess and brutal desir to do harm to
some live be no matter whom it will be perceiv that it wa not
without reason that jean valjean passport describ him as a veri
danger man
from year to year thi soul had dri awai slowli but with fatal

when the hour came for him to take hi departur from the gallei when
jean valjean heard in hi ear the strang word thou art free the

of the true light of the live suddenli penetr within him but it
wa not long befor thi rai pale jean valjean had been dazzl by
the idea of liberti he had believ in a new life he veri speedili
perceiv what sort of liberti it is to which a yellow passport is
provid
and thi wa encompass with much bitter he had calcul that
hi earn dure hi sojourn in the gallei ought to amount to a
hundr and seventyon franc it is but just to add that he had
forgotten to includ in hi calcul the forc repos of sundai
and festiv dai dure nineteen year which entail a diminut of
about eighti franc at all event hi hoard had been reduc by

attitud and becam motionless onc more
throughout thi hideou medit the thought which we have abov
indic move incessantli through hi brain enter withdrew
reenter and in a manner oppress him and then he thought also
without know why and with the mechan persist of reveri of
a convict name brevet whom he had known in the gallei and whose
trouser had been upheld by a singl suspend of knit cotton the
checker pattern of that suspend recur incessantli to hi mind
he remain in thi situat and would have so remain indefinit
even until daybreak had not the clock struck oneth half or quarter
hour it seem to him that that stroke said to him come on
he rose to hi feet hesit still anoth moment and listen all
wa quiet in the hous then he walk straight ahead with short
step to the window of which he caught a glimps the night wa not
veri dark there wa a full moon across which cours larg cloud
driven by the wind thi creat outdoor altern shadow and gleam
of light eclips then bright open of the cloud and indoor a
sort of twilight thi twilight suffici to enabl a person to see
hi wai intermitt on account of the cloud resembl the sort of
livid light which fall through an airhol in a cellar befor which
the passersbi come and go on arriv at the window jean valjean
examin it it had no grate it open in the garden and wa
fasten accord to the fashion of the countri onli by a small pin
he open it but as a rush of cold and pierc air penetr the
room abruptli he close it again immedi he scrutin the
garden with that attent gaze which studi rather than look the
garden wa enclos by a toler low white wall easi to climb far
awai at the extrem he perceiv top of tree space at regular
interv which indic that the wall separ the garden from an
avenu or lane plant with tree

the bed put hi shoe into on of hi pocket shut the whole thing up
again threw the knapsack on hi shoulder put on hi cap drew the
visor down over hi ey felt for hi cudgel went and place it in
the angl of the window then return to the bed and resolut
seiz the object which he had deposit there it resembl a short
bar of iron point like a pike at on end it would have been
difficult to distinguish in that dark for what employ that bit
of iron could have been design perhap it wa a lever possibl it
wa a club
in the daytim it would have been possibl to recogn it as noth
more than a miner candlestick convict were at that period
sometim emploi in quarri stone from the lofti hill which
environ toulon and it wa not rare for them to have miner tool at
their command these miner candlestick ar of massiv iron
termin at the lower extrem by a point by mean of which thei
ar stuck into the rock
he took the candlestick in hi right hand hold hi breath and
try to deaden the sound of hi tread he direct hi step to the
door of the adjoin room occupi by the bishop as we alreadi know
on arriv at thi door he found it ajar the bishop had not close

he gave the door a push
he push it gentli with the tip of hi finger lightli with the
furtiv and uneasi gentl of a cat which is desir of enter
the door yield to thi pressur and made an impercept and silent
movement which enlarg the open a littl
he wait a moment then gave the door a second and a bolder push
it continu to yield in silenc the open wa now larg enough to
allow him to pass but near the door there stood a littl tabl which
form an embarrass angl with it and bar the entranc
jean valjean recogn the difficulti it wa necessari at ani cost
to enlarg the apertur still further
he decid on hi cours of action and gave the door a third push
more energet than the two preced thi time a badli oil hing
suddenli emit amid the silenc a hoars and prolong cry
jean valjean shudder the nois of the hing rang in hi ear with
someth of the pierc and formid sound of the trump of the dai
of judgment
in the fantast exagger of the first moment he almost imagin
that that hing had just becom anim and had suddenli assum a
terribl life and that it wa bark like a dog to arous everi on
and warn and to wake those who were asleep he halt shudder
bewild and fell back from the tip of hi toe upon hi heel he
heard the arteri in hi templ beat like two forg hammer and
it seem to him that hi breath issu from hi breast with the roar
of the wind issu from a cavern it seem imposs to him that the
horribl clamor of that irrit hing should not have disturb the
entir household like the shock of an earthquak the door push by
him had taken the alarm and had shout the old man would rise at
onc the two old women would shriek out peopl would come to their
assist in less than a quarter of an hour the town would be in an
uproar and the gendarmeri on hand for a moment he thought himself

open he ventur to peep into the next room noth had stir
there he lent an ear noth wa move in the hous the nois made
by the rusti hing had not awaken ani on
thi first danger wa past but there still reign a fright tumult
within him nevertheless he did not retreat even when he had thought
himself lost he had not drawn back hi onli thought now wa to finish
as soon as possibl he took a step and enter the room
thi room wa in a state of perfect calm here and there vagu and
confus form were distinguish which in the daylight were paper
scatter on a tabl open folio volum pile upon a stool an
armchair heap with cloth a priedieu and which at that hour were

precaut take care not to knock against the furnitur he could
hear at the extrem of the room the even and tranquil breath of
the sleep bishop
he suddenli came to a halt he wa near the bed he had arriv there
sooner than he had thought for
natur sometim mingl her effect and her spectacl with our
action with sombr and intellig appropri as though she

deed and so mani holi action wa hang over the edg of the bed
hi whole face wa illumin with a vagu express of satisfact

that slumber in that isol and with a neighbor like himself had
about it someth sublim of which he wa vagu but imperi
consciou
no on could have told what wa pass within him not even himself
in order to attempt to form an idea of it it is necessari to think of
the most violent of thing in the presenc of the most gentl even on
hi visag it would have been imposs to distinguish anyth with
certainti it wa a sort of haggard astonish he gaze at it and
that wa all but what wa hi thought it would have been imposs

indecis on would have said that he wa hesit between the two
abyssesth on in which on lose on self and that in which on
save on self he seem prepar to crush that skull or to kiss

jean valjean left the town as though he were flee from it he set
out at a veri hasti pace through the field take whatev road and
path present themselv to him without perceiv that he wa
incessantli retrac hi step he wander thu the whole morn
without have eaten anyth and without feel hungri he wa the
prei of a throng of novel sensat he wa consciou of a sort of
rage he did not know against whom it wa direct he could not have
told whether he wa touch or humili there came over him at
moment a strang emot which he resist and to which he oppos the
hard acquir dure the last twenti year of hi life thi state
of mind fatigu him he perceiv with dismai that the sort of
fright calm which the injustic of hi misfortun had confer upon
him wa give wai within him he ask himself what would replac
thi at time he would have actual prefer to be in prison with
the gendarm and that thing should not have happen in thi wai it
would have agit him less although the season wa toler far
advanc there were still a few late flower in the hedgerow here
and there whose odor as he pass through them in hi march recal
to him memori of hi childhood these memori were almost
intoler to him it wa so long sinc thei had recur to him
unutter thought assembl within him in thi manner all dai long
as the sun declin to it set cast long shadow athwart the
soil from everi pebbl jean valjean sat down behind a bush upon a
larg ruddi plain which wa absolut desert there wa noth on
the horizon except the alp not even the spire of a distant villag
jean valjean might have been three leagu distant from d a path
which intersect the plain pass a few pace from the bush
in the middl of thi medit which would have contribut not a
littl to render hi rag terrifi to ani on who might have
encount him a joyou sound becam audibl
he turn hi head and saw a littl savoyard about ten year of ag
come up the path and sing hi hurdygurdi on hi hip and hi
marmotbox on hi back
on of those gai and gentl children who go from land to land
afford a view of their knee through the hole in their trouser
without stop hi song the lad halt in hi march from time to

toss up hi hand of sou which up to that time he had caught
with a good deal of adroit on the back of hi hand
thi time the fortys piec escap him and went roll toward the
brushwood until it reach jean valjean
jean valjean set hi foot upon it
in the meantim the child had look after hi coin and had caught
sight of him
he show no astonish but walk straight up to the man
the spot wa absolut solitari as far as the ey could see there wa
not a person on the plain or on the path the onli sound wa the tini
feebl cri of a flock of bird of passag which wa travers the
heaven at an immens height the child wa stand with hi back to
the sun which cast thread of gold in hi hair and empurpl with it
bloodr gleam the savag face of jean valjean

compos of ignor and innoc my monei

him by the collar of hi blous and shook him at the same time he made
an effort to displac the big ironshod shoe which rest on hi
treasur

the child wept jean valjean rais hi head he still remain seat
hi ey were troubl he gaze at the child in a sort of amaz
then he stretch out hi hand toward hi cudgel and cri in a
terribl voic who there

feet hi foot still rest on the silver piec he ad
will you take yourself off
the frighten child look at him then began to trembl from head to
foot and after a few moment of stupor he set out run at the top
of hi speed without dare to turn hi neck or to utter a cry
nevertheless lack of breath forc him to halt after a certain
distanc and jean valjean heard him sob in the midst of hi own
reveri
at the end of a few moment the child had disappear
the sun had set
the shadow were descend around jean valjean he had eaten noth
all dai it is probabl that he wa feverish
he had remain stand and had not chang hi attitud after the
child flight the breath heav hi chest at long and irregular
interv hi gaze fix ten or twelv pace in front of him seem
to be scrutin with profound attent the shape of an ancient
fragment of blue earthenwar which had fallen in the grass all at onc
he shiver he had just begun to feel the chill of even
he settl hi cap more firmli on hi brow sought mechan to
cross and button hi blous advanc a step and stop to pick up hi
cudgel
at that moment he caught sight of the fortys piec which hi foot
had half ground into the earth and which wa shine among the
pebbl it wa as though he had receiv a galvan shock what is
thi he mutter between hi teeth he recoil three pace then
halt without be abl to detach hi gaze from the spot which hi
foot had trodden but an instant befor as though the thing which lai
glitter there in the gloom had been an open ey rivet upon him
at the expir of a few moment he dart convuls toward the
silver coin seiz it and straighten himself up again and began to
gaze afar off over the plain at the same time cast hi ey toward
all point of the horizon as he stood there erect and shiver like
a terrifi wild anim which is seek refug
he saw noth night wa fall the plain wa cold and vagu great
bank of violet haze were rise in the gleam of the twilight
he said ah and set out rapidli in the direct in which the child
had disappear after about thirti pace he paus look about him
and saw noth
then he shout with all hi might
littl gervai littl gervai
he paus and wait
there wa no repli
the landscap wa gloomi and desert he wa encompass by space
there wa noth around him but an obscur in which hi gaze wa
lost and a silenc which engulf hi voic
an ici north wind wa blow and impart to thing around him a sort
of lugubri life the bush shook their thin littl arm with
incred furi on would have said that thei were threaten and
pursu some on
he set out on hi march again then he began to run and from time to
time he halt and shout into that solitud with a voic which wa
the most formid and the most disconsol that it wa possibl to
hear littl gervai littl gervai
assuredli if the child had heard him he would have been alarm and
would have taken good care not to show himself but the child wa no
doubt alreadi far awai
he encount a priest on horseback he step up to him and said
monsieur le cur have you seen a child pass
no said the priest
on name littl gervai
i have seen no on
he drew two fivefranc piec from hi moneybag and hand them to the
priest
monsieur le cur thi is for your poor peopl monsieur le cur he
wa a littl lad about ten year old with a marmot i think and a
hurdygurdi on of those savoyard you know
i have not seen him
littl gervai there ar no villag here can you tell me
if he is like what you sai my friend he is a littl stranger such
person pass through these part we know noth of them
jean valjean seiz two more coin of five franc each with violenc
and gave them to the priest
for your poor he said
then he ad wildli
monsieur labb have me arrest i am a thief
the priest put spur to hi hors and fled in hast much alarm
jean valjean set out on a run in the direct which he had first
taken
in thi wai he travers a toler long distanc gaze call
shout but he met no on two or three time he ran across the plain
toward someth which convei to him the effect of a human be
reclin or crouch down it turn out to be noth but brushwood
or rock nearli on a level with the earth at length at a spot where
three path intersect each other he stop the moon had risen he
sent hi gaze into the distanc and shout for the last time littl
gervai littl gervai littl gervai hi shout di awai in the
mist without even awaken an echo he murmur yet onc more
littl gervai but in a feebl and almost inarticul voic it wa
hi last effort hi leg gave wai abruptli under him as though an
invis power had suddenli overwhelm him with the weight of hi
evil conscienc he fell exhaust on a larg stone hi fist
clench in hi hair and hi face on hi knee and he cri i am a
wretch
then hi heart burst and he began to cry it wa the first time that
he had wept in nineteen year
when jean valjean left the bishop hous he wa as we have seen
quit thrown out of everyth that had been hi thought hitherto he
could not yield to the evid of what wa go on within him he
harden himself against the angel action and the gentl word of the
old man you have promis me to becom an honest man i bui your
soul i take it awai from the spirit of pervers i give it to the
good god
thi recur to hi mind unceasingli to thi celesti kind he
oppos pride which is the fortress of evil within us he wa
indistinctli consciou that the pardon of thi priest wa the greatest
assault and the most formid attack which had move him yet that
hi obduraci wa final settl if he resist thi clemenc that if
he yield he should be oblig to renounc that hatr with which the
action of other men had fill hi soul through so mani year and
which pleas him that thi time it wa necessari to conquer or to be
conquer and that a struggl a coloss and final struggl had been
begun between hi vicious and the good of that man
in the presenc of these light he proceed like a man who is
intox as he walk thu with haggard ey did he have a
distinct percept of what might result to him from hi adventur at
d did he understand all those mysteri murmur which warn or
importun the spirit at certain moment of life did a voic whisper in
hi ear that he had just pass the solemn hour of hi destini that
there no longer remain a middl cours for him that if he were not
henceforth the best of men he would be the worst that it behoov him
now so to speak to mount higher than the bishop or fall lower than
the convict that if he wish to becom good he must becom an angel
that if he wish to remain evil he must becom a monster
here again some question must be put which we have alreadi put to
ourselv elsewher did he catch some shadow of all thi in hi
thought in a confus wai misfortun certainli as we have said doe
form the educ of the intellig nevertheless it is doubt
whether jean valjean wa in a condit to disentangl all that we have
here indic if these idea occur to him he but caught glimps
of rather than saw them and thei onli succeed in throw him into
an unutter and almost pain state of emot on emerg from
that black and deform thing which is call the gallei the bishop
had hurt hi soul as too vivid a light would have hurt hi ey on
emerg from the dark the futur life the possibl life which
offer itself to him henceforth all pure and radiant fill him with
tremor and anxieti he no longer knew where he realli wa like an
owl who should suddenli see the sun rise the convict had been dazzl
and blind as it were by virtu
that which wa certain that which he did not doubt wa that he wa no
longer the same man that everyth about him wa chang that it wa
no longer in hi power to make it as though the bishop had not spoken
to him and had not touch him
in thi state of mind he had encount littl gervai and had rob
him of hi forti sou why he certainli could not have explain it
wa thi the last effect and the suprem effort as it were of the
evil thought which he had brought awai from the galleysa remnant of
impuls a result of what is call in static acquir forc it
wa that and it wa also perhap even less than that let us sai it

noth is more common than a cart or a truck at the door of a

painter who had pass that wai
it wa the forecarriag of on of those truck which ar us in

onli look at some men to distrust them for on feel that thei ar
dark in both direct thei ar uneasi in the rear and threaten in
front there is someth of the unknown about them on can no more
answer for what thei have done than for what thei will do the shadow
which thei bear in their glanc denounc them from mere hear

thi thnardier if he himself wa to be believ had been a soldiera

howev we will remark by the wai everyth wa not ridicul and
superfici in that curiou epoch to which we ar allud and which
mai be design as the anarchi of baptism name by the side of
thi romant element which we have just indic there is the social

there were two vast workroom on for the men and the other for

of find employ and bread father madelein requir of the men

father madelein gave employ to everi on he exact but on

as we have said in the midst of thi activ of which he wa the
caus and the pivot father madelein made hi fortun but a singular
thing in a simpl man of busi it did not seem as though that were
hi chief care he appear to be think much of other and littl
of himself in 1820 he wa known to have a sum of six hundr and
thirti thousand franc lodg in hi name with laffitt but befor

countri befor he enrich himself the good soul said he is an
ambiti man thi seem all the more probabl sinc the man wa
religi and even practis hi religion to a certain degre a thing
which wa veri favor view at that epoch he went regularli to low
mass everi sundai the local deputi who nose out all rivalri
everywher soon began to grow uneasi over thi religion thi deputi
had been a member of the legisl bodi of the empir and share the
religi idea of a father of the oratoir known under the name of
fouch duc dotrant whose creatur and friend he had been he
indulg in gentl railleri at god with close door but when he
beheld the wealthi manufactur madelein go to low mass at seven
oclock he perceiv in him a possibl candid and resolv to

vesper ambit wa at that time in the direct accept of the
word a race to the steepl the poor profit by thi terror as well
as the good god for the honor deputi also found two bed in the

we have seen that the countri ow much to him the poor ow him
everyth he wa so us and he wa so gentl that peopl had been
oblig to honor and respect him hi workmen in particular ador
him and he endur thi ador with a sort of melancholi graviti
when he wa known to be rich peopl in societi bow to him and he

black and with crape on hi hat
thi mourn wa notic in the town and comment on it seem to
throw a light on m madelein origin it wa conclud that some
relationship exist between him and the vener bishop he ha
gone into mourn for the bishop of d said the drawingroom thi

by the more numer courtesi of the old women and the more plenti

he said no madam
but resum the dowag you ar wear mourn for him
he repli it is becaus i wa a servant in hi famili in my youth
anoth thing which wa remark wa that everi time that he

1821 the moment arriv when the word monsieur le mair wa
pronounc at m sur m with almost the same accent as monseigneur the
bishop had been pronounc in d in 1815 peopl came from a distanc
of ten leagu around to consult m madelein he put an end to
differ he prevent lawsuit he reconcil enemi everi on
took him for the judg and with good reason it seem as though he
had for a soul the book of the natur law it wa like an epidem of

possess of the whole district
on singl man in the town in the arrondiss absolut escap
thi contagion and whatev father madelein did remain hi
oppon as though a sort of incorrupt and imperturb instinct
kept him on the alert and uneasi it seem in fact as though there
exist in certain men a verit bestial instinct though pure and
upright like all instinct which creat antipathi and sympathi
which fatal separ on natur from anoth natur which doe not
hesit which feel no disquiet which doe not hold it peac and
which never beli itself clear in it obscur infal

it frequent happen that when m madelein wa pass along a
street calm affection surround by the bless of all a man
of lofti statur clad in an irongrai frockcoat arm with a heavi
cane and wear a batter hat turn round abruptli behind him and
follow him with hi ey until he disappear with fold arm and a
slow shake of the head and hi upper lip rais in compani with hi
lower to hi nose a sort of signific grimac which might be
translat by what is that man after all i certainli have seen him
somewher in ani case i am not hi dupe
thi person grave with a graviti which wa almost menac wa on of
those men who even when onli seen by a rapid glimps arrest the

when javert arriv at m sur m the fortun of the great manufactur
wa alreadi made and father madelein had becom monsieur madelein
certain polic offic have a peculiar physiognomi which is
complic with an air of base mingl with an air of author
javert possess thi physiognomi minu the base
it is our convict that if soul were visibl to the ey we should
be abl to see distinctli that strang thing that each on individu
of the human race correspond to some on of the speci of the anim
creation and we could easili recogn thi truth hardli perceiv by
the thinker that from the oyster to the eagl from the pig to the
tiger all anim exist in man and that each on of them is in a man
sometim even sever of them at a time
anim ar noth els than the figur of our virtu and our vice
strai befor our ey the visibl phantom of our soul god show
them to us in order to induc us to reflect onli sinc anim ar
mere shadow god ha not made them capabl of educ in the full
sens of the word what is the us on the contrari our soul be
realiti and have a goal which is appropri to them god ha
bestow on them intellig that is to sai the possibl of

soul of whatev sort it mai be the util which it contain
thi be it said is of cours from the restrict point of view of the
terrestri life which is appar and without prejudg the profound
question of the anterior or ulterior person of the be which
ar not man the visibl i in nowis author the thinker to deni
the latent i have made thi reserv let us pass on
now if the reader will admit for a moment with us that in everi man
there is on of the anim speci of creation it will be easi for us
to sai what there wa in polic offic javert
the peasant of asturia ar convinc that in everi litter of wolv
there is on dog which is kill by the mother becaus otherwis as
he grew up he would devour the other littl on
give to thi dogson of a wolf a human face and the result will be
javert
javert had been born in prison of a fortunetel whose husband wa
in the gallei as he grew up he thought that he wa outsid the pale
of societi and he despair of ever reenter it he observ that
societi unpardoningli exclud two class of menthos who attack it
and those who guard it he had no choic except between these two
class at the same time he wa consciou of an indescrib
foundat of rigid regular and probiti complic with an
inexpress hatr for the race of bohemian whenc he wa sprung he
enter the polic he succeed there at forti year of ag he wa an
inspector
dure hi youth he had been emploi in the convict establish of
the south
befor proceed further let us come to an understand as to the
word human face which we have just appli to javert
the human face of javert consist of a flat nose with two deep
nostril toward which enorm whisker ascend on hi cheek on
felt ill at eas when he saw these two forest and these two cavern
for the first time when javert laughedand hi laugh wa rare and
terriblehi thin lip part and reveal to view not onli hi teeth
but hi gum and around hi nose there form a flatten and savag
fold as on the muzzl of a wild beast javert seriou wa a
watchdog when he laugh he wa a tiger as for the rest he had veri
littl skull and a great deal of jaw hi hair conceal hi forehead
and fell over hi eyebrow between hi ey there wa a perman
central frown like an imprint of wrath hi gaze wa obscur hi
mouth purs up and terribl hi air that of feroci command
thi man wa compos of two veri simpl and two veri good sentiment
compar but he render them almost bad by dint of exagger
themrespect for author hatr of rebellion and in hi ey
murder robberi all crime ar onli form of rebellion he envelop
in a blind and profound faith everi on who had a function in the
state from the prime minist to the rural policeman he cover with
scorn avers and disgust everi on who had onc cross the legal
threshold of evil he wa absolut and admit no except on the
on hand he said the functionari can make no mistak the magistr
is never the wrong on the other hand he said these men ar
irremedi lost noth good can come from them he fulli share
the opinion of those extrem mind which attribut to human law i know
not what power of make or if the reader will have it so of
authent demon and who place a styx at the base of societi he
wa stoical seriou auster a melancholi dreamer humbl and
haughti like fanat hi glanc wa like a gimlet cold and
pierc hi whole life hung on these two word watch and
supervis he had introduc a straight line into what is the most
crook thing in the world he possess the conscienc of hi
us the religion of hi function and he wa a spy as other
men ar priest woe to the man who fell into hi hand he would have
arrest hi own father if the latter had escap from the gallei
and would have denounc hi mother if she had broken her ban and he
would have done it with that sort of inward satisfact which is
confer by virtu and withal a life of privat isol
abneg chastiti with never a divers it wa implac duti
the polic understood as the spartan understood sparta a pitiless
ly in wait a feroci honesti a marbl inform brutu in
vidocq
javert whole person wa express of the man who spi and who
withdraw himself from observ the mystic school of joseph de
maistr which at that epoch season with lofti cosmogoni those thing
which were call the ultra newspap would not have fail to
declar that javert wa a symbol hi brow wa not visibl it
disappear beneath hi hat hi ey were not visibl sinc thei were
lost under hi eyebrow hi chin wa not visibl for it wa plung
in hi cravat hi hand were not visibl thei were drawn up in hi
sleev and hi cane wa not visibl he carri it under hi coat
but when the occas present itself there wa suddenli seen to
emerg from all thi shadow as from an ambuscad a narrow and angular
forehead a bale glanc a threaten chin enorm hand and a
monstrou cudgel
in hi leisur moment which were far from frequent he read although
he hate book thi caus him to be not wholli illiter thi could
be recogn by some emphasi in hi speech
as we have said he had no vice when he wa pleas with himself he
permit himself a pinch of snuff therein lai hi connect with
human
the reader will have no difficulti in understand that javert wa the
terror of that whole class which the annual statist of the ministri
of justic design under the rubric vagrant the name of javert
rout them by it mere utter the face of javert petrifi them at
sight
such wa thi formid man
javert wa like an ey constantli fix on m madelein an ey full of
suspicion and conjectur m madelein had final perceiv the fact
but it seem to be of no import to him he did not even put a
question to javert he neither sought nor avoid him he bore that
embarrass and almost oppress gaze without appear to notic it
he treat javert with eas and courtesi as he did all the rest of the
world
it wa divin from some word which escap javert that he had
secretli investig with that curios which belong to the race
and into which there enter as much instinct as will all the anterior
trace which father madelein might have left elsewher he seem to
know and he sometim said in covert word that some on had glean
certain inform in a certain district about a famili which had
disappear onc he chanc to sai as he wa talk to himself i
think i have him then he remain pensiv for three dai and utter
not a word it seem that the thread which he thought he held had
broken
moreov and thi furnish the necessari correct for the too
absolut sens which certain word might present there can be noth
realli infal in a human creatur and the peculiar of instinct
is that it can becom confus thrown off the track and defeat
otherwis it would be superior to intellig and the beast would be
found to be provid with a better light than man
javert wa evid somewhat disconcert by the perfect natur
and tranquil of m madelein
on dai nevertheless hi strang manner appear to produc an
impress on m madelein it wa on the follow occas
chapter vifath fauchelev
on morn m madelein wa pass through an unpav allei of m sur
m he heard a nois and saw a group some distanc awai he
approach an old man name father fauchelev had just fallen
beneath hi cart hi hors have tumbl down
thi fauchelev wa on of the few enemi whom m madelein had at
that time when madelein arriv in the neighborhood fauchelev an
exnotari and a peasant who wa almost educ had a busi which
wa begin to be in a bad wai fauchelev had seen thi simpl
workman grow rich while he a lawyer wa be ruin thi had
fill him with jealousi and he had done all he could on everi
occas to injur madelein then bankruptci had come and as the old
man had noth left but a cart and a hors and neither famili nor
children he had turn carter
the hors had two broken leg and could not rise the old man wa
caught in the wheel the fall had been so unlucki that the whole
weight of the vehicl rest on hi breast the cart wa quit heavili
laden father fauchelev wa rattl in the throat in the most
lament manner thei had tri but in vain to drag him out an
unmethod effort aid awkwardli given a wrong shake might kill
him it wa imposs to disengag him otherwis than by lift the
vehicl off of him javert who had come up at the moment of the
accid had sent for a jackscrew
m madelein arriv peopl stood asid respectfulli
help cri old fauchelev who will be good and save the old
man
m madelein turn toward those present
is there a jackscrew to be had
on ha been sent for answer the peasant
how long will it take to get it
thei have gone for the nearest to flachot place where there is a
farrier but it make no differ it will take a good quarter of an
hour
a quarter of an hour exclaim madelein
it had rain on the preced night the soil wa soak
the cart wa sink deeper into the earth everi moment and crush
the old carter breast more and more it wa evid that hi rib
would be broken in five minut more
it is imposs to wait anoth quarter of an hour said madelein
to the peasant who were stare at him
we must
but it will be too late then dont you see that the cart is sink
well
listen resum madelein there is still room enough under the cart
to allow a man to crawl beneath it and rais it with hi back onli
half a minut and the poor man can be taken out is there ani on here
who ha stout loin and heart there ar five loui dor to be earn
not a man in the group stir
ten loui said madelein
the person present drop their ey on of them mutter a man
would need to be devilish strong and then he run the risk of get
crush
come began madelein again twenti loui
the same silenc
it is not the will which is lack said a voic
m madelein turn round and recogn javert he had not notic
him on hi arriv
javert went on

memori in that town that a seriou gap would exist in thi book if we
did not narrat them in their most minut detail among these detail

other servic she wa a nun as other women ar cook thi type is not
so veri rare the monast order gladli accept thi heavi peasant
earthenwar which is easili fashion into a capuchin or an ursulin
these rustic ar util for the rough work of devot the
transit from a drover to a carmelit is not in the least violent
the on turn into the other without much effort the fund of ignor
common to the villag and the cloister is a prepar readi at hand
and place the boor at onc on the same foot as the monk a littl
more amplitud in the smock and it becom a frock sister perptu
wa a robust nun from marin near pontois who chatter her patoi
drone grumbl sugar the potion accord to the bigotri or the
hypocrisi of the invalid treat her patient abruptli roughli wa

death agoni with prayer mumbl in a rage wa bold honest and
ruddi
sister simplic wa white with a waxen pallor besid sister perptu
she wa the taper besid the candl vincent de paul ha divin

the town and the ward of the hospit for enclosur onli obedi
for grate onli the fear of god for veil onli modesti thi ideal
wa realiz in the live person of sister simplic she had never
been young and it seem as though she would never grow old no on
could have told sister simplic ag she wa a personw dare not sai
a womanwho wa gentl auster wellbr cold and who had never

solid than granit she touch the unhappi with finger that were
charmingli pure and fine there wa so to speak silenc in her
speech she said just what wa necessari and she possess a tone of
voic which would have equal edifi a confession or enchant a
drawingroom thi delicaci accommod itself to the serg gown
find in thi harsh contact a continu remind of heaven and of
god let us emphas on detail never to have li never to have
said for ani interest whatev even in indiffer ani singl thing
which wa not the truth the sacr truth wa sister simplic
distinct trait it wa the accent of her virtu she wa almost
renown in the congreg for thi imperturb verac the abb
sicard speak of sister simplic in a letter to the deafmut massieu
howev pure and sincer we mai be we all bear upon our candor the
crack of the littl innoc lie she did not littl lie innoc

the result wa the white which we have mentioneda white which
cover even her lip and her ey with radianc her smile wa white
her glanc wa white there wa not a singl spider web not a grain
of dust on the glass window of that conscienc on enter the order
of saint vincent de paul she had taken the name of simplic by special
choic simplic of sicili as we know is the saint who prefer to
allow both her breast to be torn off rather than to sai that she had
been born at segesta when she had been born at syracusea lie which
would have save her thi patron saint suit thi soul
sister simplic on her entranc into the order had had two fault
which she had gradual correct she had a tast for dainti and
she like to receiv letter she never read anyth but a book of
prayer print in latin in coars type she did not understand latin
but she understood the book
thi piou woman had conceiv an affect for fantin probabl

meanwhil m madelein had return home he had taken the longest wai
to return from master scaufflair as though the parsonag door had
been a temptat for him and he had wish to avoid it he ascend
to hi room and there he shut himself up which wa a veri simpl act
sinc he like to go to bed earli nevertheless the portress of the
factori who wa at the same time m madelein onli servant
notic that the latter light wa extinguish at halfpast eight
and she mention it to the cashier when he came home ad
is monsieur le mair ill i thought he had a rather singular air
thi cashier occupi a room situat directli under m madelein
chamber he paid no heed to the portresss word but went to bed and
to sleep toward midnight he woke up with a start in hi sleep he had
heard a nois abov hi head he listen it wa a footstep pace
back and forth as though some on were walk in the room abov him
he listen more attent and recogn m madelein step thi
struck him as strang usual there wa no nois in m madelein
chamber until he rose in the morn a moment later the cashier heard
a nois which resembl that of a cupboard be open and then shut
again then a piec of furnitur wa disarrang then a paus ensu
then the step began again the cashier sat up in bed quit awak now
and stare and through hi windowpan he saw the reddish gleam of a
light window reflect on the opposit wall from the direct of
the rai it could onli come from the window of m madelein chamber
the reflect waver as though it came rather from a fire which had
been light than from a candl the shadow of the windowfram wa not
shown which indic that the window wa wide open the fact that
thi window wa open in such cold weather wa surpris the cashier
fell asleep again an hour or two later he wake again the same step
wa still pass slowli and regularli back and forth overhead
the reflect wa still visibl on the wall but now it wa pale and
peac like the reflect of a lamp or of a candl the window wa
still open
thi is what had taken place in m madelein room
chapter iiia tempest in a skull
the reader ha no doubt alreadi divin that m madelein is no other
than jean valjean
we have alreadi gaze into the depth of thi conscienc the moment
ha now come when we must take anoth look into it we do so not
without emot and trepid there is noth more terribl in
exist than thi sort of contempl the ey of the spirit can
nowher find more dazzl brillianc and more shadow than in man it
can fix itself on no other thing which is more formid more
complic more mysteri and more infinit there is a spectacl
more grand than the sea it is heaven there is a spectacl more grand
than heaven it is the inmost recess of the soul
to make the poem of the human conscienc were it onli with refer
to a singl man were it onli in connect with the basest of men
would be to blend all epic into on superior and definit epic
conscienc is the chao of chimra of lust and of temptat the
furnac of dream the lair of idea of which we ar asham it is the
pandemonium of sophism it is the battlefield of the passion
penetr at certain hour past the livid face of a human be who
is engag in reflect and look behind gaze into that soul gaze
into that obscur there beneath that extern silenc battl of
giant like those record in homer ar in progress skirmish of
dragon and hydra and swarm of phantom as in milton visionari
circl as in dant what a solemn thing is thi infin which everi
man bear within him and which he measur with despair against the
capric of hi brain and the action of hi life
alighieri on dai met with a sinisterlook door befor which he
hesit here is on befor us upon whose threshold we hesit let
us enter nevertheless
we have but littl to add to what the reader alreadi know of what had
happen to jean valjean after the adventur with littl gervai from
that moment forth he wa as we have seen a total differ man
what the bishop had wish to make of him that he carri out it wa
more than a transform it wa a transfigur
he succeed in disappear sold the bishop silver reserv onli
the candlestick as a souvenir crept from town to town travers
franc came to m sur m conceiv the idea which we have mention
accomplish what we have relat succeed in render himself safe
from seizur and inaccess and thenceforth establish at m sur
m happi in feel hi conscienc sadden by the past and the first
half of hi exist beli by the last he live in peac reassur
and hope have henceforth onli two thoughtsto conceal hi name
and to sanctifi hi life to escap men and to return to god
these two thought were so close intertwin in hi mind that thei
form but a singl on there both were equal absorb and
imper and rule hi slightest action in gener thei conspir
to regul the conduct of hi life thei turn him toward the gloom
thei render him kindli and simpl thei counsel him to the same
thing sometim howev thei conflict in that case as the
reader will rememb the man whom all the countri of m sur m call
m madelein did not hesit to sacrific the first to the secondhi
secur to hi virtu thu in spite of all hi reserv and all hi
prudenc he had preserv the bishop candlestick worn mourn for
him summon and interrog all the littl savoyard who pass that
wai collect inform regard the famili at faverol and
save old fauchelev life despit the disquiet insinu of
javert it seem as we have alreadi remark as though he thought
follow the exampl of all those who have been wise holi and just
that hi first duti wa not toward himself
at the same time it must be confess noth just like thi had yet
present itself
never had the two idea which govern the unhappi man whose suffer
we ar narrat engag in so seriou a struggl he understood thi
confusedli but profoundli at the veri first word pronounc by javert
when the latter enter hi studi at the moment when that name which
he had buri beneath so mani layer wa so strang articul he
wa struck with stupor and as though intox with the sinist
eccentr of hi destini and through thi stupor he felt that
shudder which preced great shock he bent like an oak at the
approach of a storm like a soldier at the approach of an assault he
felt shadow fill with thunder and lightn descend upon hi
head as he listen to javert the first thought which occur to him
wa to go to run and denounc himself to take that champmathieu out
of prison and place himself there thi wa as pain and as poignant
as an incis in the live flesh then it pass awai and he said to
himself we will see we will see he repress thi first gener
instinct and recoil befor heroism
it would be beauti no doubt after the bishop holi word after
so mani year of repent and abneg in the midst of a penit
admir begun if thi man had not flinch for an instant even in
the presenc of so terribl a conjectur but had continu to walk
with the same step toward thi yawn precipic at the bottom of
which lai heaven that would have been beauti but it wa not thu
we must render an account of the thing which went on in thi soul and
we can onli tell what there wa there he wa carri awai at first
by the instinct of selfpreserv he ralli all hi idea in
hast stifl hi emot took into consider javert presenc
that great danger postpon all decis with the firm of terror
shook off thought as to what he had to do and resum hi calm as
a warrior pick up hi buckler
he remain in thi state dure the rest of the dai a whirlwind
within a profound tranquil without he took no preserv
measur as thei mai be call everyth wa still confus and
jostl togeth in hi brain hi troubl wa so great that he could
not perceiv the form of a singl idea distinctli and he could have
told noth about himself except that he had receiv a great blow
he repair to fantin bed of suffer as usual and prolong hi
visit through a kindli instinct tell himself that he must behav
thu and recommend her well to the sister in case he should be
oblig to be absent himself he had a vagu feel that he might be
oblig to go to arra and without have the least in the world made
up hi mind to thi trip he said to himself that be as he wa
beyond the shadow of ani suspicion there could be noth out of the
wai in be a wit to what wa to take place and he engag the
tilburi from scaufflair in order to be prepar in ani event
he dine with a good deal of appetit
on return to hi room he commun with himself
he examin the situat and found it unpreced so unpreced
that in the midst of hi reveri he rose from hi chair move by some
inexplic impuls of anxieti and bolt hi door he fear lest
someth more should enter he wa barricad himself against
possibl
a moment later he extinguish hi light it embarrass him
it seem to him as though he might be seen
by whom
ala that on which he desir to close the door had alreadi enter
that which he desir to blind wa stare him in the facehi
conscienc
hi conscienc that is to sai god
nevertheless he delud himself at first he had a feel of secur
and of solitud the bolt onc drawn he thought himself impregn
the candl extinguish he felt himself invis then he took
possess of himself he set hi elbow on the tabl lean hi head
on hi hand and began to medit in the dark
where do i stand am not i dream what have i heard is it realli
true that i have seen that javert and that he spoke to me in that
manner who can that champmathieu be so he resembl me is it
possibl when i reflect that yesterdai i wa so tranquil and so far
from suspect anyth what wa i do yesterdai at thi hour what
is there in thi incid what will the end be what is to be done
thi wa the torment in which he found himself hi brain had lost it
power of retain idea thei pass like wave and he clutch hi
brow in both hand to arrest them
noth but anguish extric itself from thi tumult which
overwhelm hi will and hi reason and from which he sought to draw
proof and resolut
hi head wa burn he went to the window and threw it wide open
there were no star in the sky he return and seat himself at the
tabl
the first hour pass in thi manner
gradual howev vagu outlin began to take form and to fix
themselv in hi medit and he wa abl to catch a glimps with
precis of the realitynot the whole situat but some of the
detail he began by recogn the fact that critic and
extraordinari as wa thi situat he wa complet master of it
thi onli caus an increas of hi stupor
independ of the sever and religi aim which he had assign to
hi action all that he had made up to that dai had been noth but a
hole in which to buri hi name that which he had alwai fear most of
all in hi hour of selfcommunion dure hi sleepless night wa to
ever hear that name pronounc he had said to himself that that would
be the end of all thing for him that on the dai when that name made
it reappear it would caus hi new life to vanish from about him
andwho knowsperhap even hi new soul within him also he shudder
at the veri thought that thi wa possibl assuredli if ani on had
said to him at such moment that the hour would come when that name
would ring in hi ear when the hideou word jean valjean would
suddenli emerg from the dark and rise in front of him when that
formid light capabl of dissip the mysteri in which he had
envelop himself would suddenli blaze forth abov hi head and that
that name would not menac him that that light would but produc an
obscur more dens that thi rent veil would but increas the
mysteri that thi earthquak would solidifi hi edific that thi
prodigi incid would have no other result so far as he wa
concern if so it seem good to him than that of render hi
exist at onc clearer and more impenetr and that out of hi
confront with the phantom of jean valjean the good and worthi
citizen monsieur madelein would emerg more honor more peac
and more respect than everif ani on had told him that he would
have toss hi head and regard the word as those of a madman well
all thi wa precis what had just come to pass all that
accumul of imposs wa a fact and god had permit these
wild fanci to becom real thing
hi reveri continu to grow clearer he came more and more to an
understand of hi posit
it seem to him that he had but just wake up from some inexplic
dream and that he found himself slip down a decliv in the
middl of the night erect shiver hold back all in vain on the
veri brink of the abyss he distinctli perceiv in the dark a
stranger a man unknown to him whom destini had mistaken for him and
whom she wa thrust into the gulf in hi stead in order that the
gulf might close onc more it wa necessari that some on himself or
that other man should fall into it he had onli let thing take their
cours
the light becam complet and he acknowledg thi to himself that
hi place wa empti in the gallei that do what he would it wa still
await him that the theft from littl gervai had led him back to
it that thi vacant place would await him and draw him on until he
fill it that thi wa inevit and fatal and then he said to
himself that at thi moment he had a substitut that it appear
that a certain champmathieu had that ill luck and that as regard
himself be present in the gallei in the person of that
champmathieu present in societi under the name of m madelein he had
noth more to fear provid that he did not prevent men from seal
over the head of that champmathieu thi stone of infami which like the
stone of the sepulchr fall onc never to rise again
all thi wa so strang and so violent that there suddenli took place
in him that indescrib movement which no man feel more than two or
three time in the cours of hi life a sort of convuls of the
conscienc which stir up all that there is doubt in the heart
which is compos of ironi of joi and of despair and which mai be
call an outburst of inward laughter
he hastili relight hi candl
well what then he said to himself what am i afraid of what is
there in all that for me to think about i am safe all is over i had
but on partli open door through which my past might invad my life
and behold that door is wall up forev that javert who ha been
annoi me so long that terribl instinct which seem to have
divin me which had divin megood god and which follow me
everywher that fright huntingdog alwai make a point at me is
thrown off the scent engag elsewher absolut turn from the
trail henceforth he is satisfi he will leav me in peac he ha
hi jean valjean who know it is even probabl that he will wish to
leav town and all thi ha been brought about without ani aid from
me and i count for noth in it ah but where is the misfortun in
thi upon my honor peopl would think to see me that some
catastroph had happen to me after all if it doe bring harm to
some on that is not my fault in the least it is provid which ha
done it all it is becaus it wish it so to be evid have i the
right to disarrang what it ha arrang what do i ask now why should
i meddl it doe not concern me what i am not satisfi but what
more do i want the goal to which i have aspir for so mani year the
dream of my night the object of my prayer to heavensecurityi
have now attain it is god who will it i can do noth against the
will of god and why doe god will it in order that i mai continu
what i have begun that i mai do good that i mai on dai be a grand
and encourag exampl that it mai be said at last that a littl
happi ha been attach to the penanc which i have undergon and
to that virtu to which i have return realli i do not understand
why i wa afraid a littl while ago to enter the hous of that good
cur and to ask hi advic thi is evid what he would have said
to me it is settl let thing take their cours let the good god do
as he like
thu did he address himself in the depth of hi own conscienc
bend over what mai be call hi own abyss he rose from hi chair
and began to pace the room come said he let us think no more
about it my resolv is taken but he felt no joi
quit the revers
on can no more prevent thought from recur to an idea than on can
the sea from return to the shore the sailor call it the tide the
guilti man call it remors god upheav the soul as he doe the
ocean
after the expir of a few moment do what he would he resum the
gloomi dialogu in which it wa he who spoke and he who listen
sai that which he would have prefer to ignor and listen to
that which he would have prefer not to hear yield to that
mysteri power which said to him think as it said to anoth
condemn man two thousand year ago march on
befor proceed further and in order to make ourselv fulli
understood let us insist upon on necessari observ
it is certain that peopl do talk to themselv there is no live
be who ha not done it it mai even be said that the word is never a
more magnific mysteri than when it goe from thought to conscienc
within a man and when it return from conscienc to thought it is in
thi sens onli that the word so often emploi in thi chapter he
said he exclaim must be understood on speak to on self
talk to on self exclaim to on self without break the
extern silenc there is a great tumult everyth about us talk
except the mouth the realiti of the soul ar nonetheless realiti
becaus thei ar not visibl and palpabl
so he ask himself where he stood he interrog himself upon that
settl resolv he confess to himself that all that he had just
arrang in hi mind wa monstrou that to let thing take their
cours to let the good god do as he like wa simpli horribl to
allow thi error of fate and of men to be carri out not to hinder
it to lend himself to it through hi silenc to do noth in short
wa to do everyth that thi wa hypocrit base in the last
degre that it wa a base cowardli sneak abject hideou crime
for the first time in eight year the wretch man had just tast the
bitter savor of an evil thought and of an evil action
he spit it out with disgust
he continu to question himself he ask himself sever what he had
meant by thi my object is attain he declar to himself that hi
life realli had an object but what object to conceal hi name to
deceiv the polic wa it for so petti a thing that he had done all
that he had done had he not anoth and a grand object which wa the
true oneto save not hi person but hi soul to becom honest and
good onc more to be a just man wa it not that abov all that
alon which he had alwai desir which the bishop had enjoin upon
himto shut the door on hi past but he wa not shut it great
god he wa reopen it by commit an infam action he wa
becom a thief onc more and the most odiou of thiev he wa
rob anoth of hi exist hi life hi peac hi place in the
sunshin he wa becom an assassin he wa murder moral
murder a wretch man he wa inflict on him that fright
live death that death beneath the open sky which is call the
gallei on the other hand to surrend himself to save that man
struck down with so melancholi an error to resum hi own name to
becom onc more out of duti the convict jean valjean that wa in
truth to achiev hi resurrect and to close forev that hell
whenc he had just emerg to fall back there in appear wa to
escap from it in realiti thi must be done he had done noth if he
did not do all thi hi whole life wa useless all hi penit wa
wast there wa no longer ani need of sai what is the us he
felt that the bishop wa there that the bishop wa present all the
more becaus he wa dead that the bishop wa gaze fixedli at him
that henceforth mayor madelein with all hi virtu would be
abomin to him and that the convict jean valjean would be pure and
admir in hi sight that men beheld hi mask but that the bishop
saw hi face that men saw hi life but that the bishop beheld hi
conscienc so he must go to arra deliv the fals jean valjean and
denounc the real on ala that wa the greatest of sacrific the
most poignant of victori the last step to take but it must be done
sad fate he would enter into sanctiti onli in the ey of god when he
return to infami in the ey of men
well said he let us decid upon thi let us do our duti let us
save thi man he utter these word aloud without perceiv that
he wa speak aloud
he took hi book verifi them and put them in order he flung in
the fire a bundl of bill which he had against petti and embarrass
tradesmen he wrote and seal a letter and on the envelop it might
have been read had there been ani on in hi chamber at the moment
to monsieur laffitt banker rue dartoi pari he drew from hi
secretari a pocketbook which contain sever banknot and the
passport of which he had made us that same year when he went to the
elect
ani on who had seen him dure the execut of these variou act
into which there enter such grave thought would have had no
suspicion of what wa go on within him onli occasion did hi
lip move at other time he rais hi head and fix hi gaze upon
some point of the wall as though there exist at that point someth
which he wish to elucid or interrog
when he had finish the letter to m laffitt he put it into hi
pocket togeth with the pocketbook and began hi walk onc more
hi reveri had not swerv from it cours he continu to see hi
duti clearli written in lumin letter which flame befor hi ey
and chang it place as he alter the direct of hi glanc
go tell your name denounc yourself
in the same wai he beheld as though thei had pass befor him in
visibl form the two idea which had up to that time form the
doubl rule of hi soulth conceal of hi name the
sanctif of hi life for the first time thei appear to him as
absolut distinct and he perceiv the distanc which separ
them he recogn the fact that on of these idea wa necessarili
good while the other might becom bad that the first wa
selfdevot and that the other wa person that the on said
my neighbour and that the other said myself that on eman
from the light and the other from dark
thei were antagonist he saw them in conflict in proport as he
medit thei grew befor the ey of hi spirit thei had now
attain coloss statur and it seem to him that he beheld within
himself in that infin of which we were recent speak in the
midst of the dark and the light a goddess and a giant contend
he wa fill with terror but it seem to him that the good thought
wa get the upper hand
he felt that he wa on the brink of the second decis crisi of hi
conscienc and of hi destini that the bishop had mark the first
phase of hi new life and that champmathieu mark the second after
the grand crisi the grand test
but the fever allai for an instant gradual resum possess of
him a thousand thought travers hi mind but thei continu to
fortifi him in hi resolut
on moment he said to himself that he wa perhap take the matter
too keenli that after all thi champmathieu wa not interest and
that he had actual been guilti of theft
he answer himself if thi man ha inde stolen a few appl
that mean a month in prison it is a long wai from that to the
gallei and who know did he steal ha it been prove the name of
jean valjean overwhelm him and seem to dispens with proof do not
the attornei for the crown alwai proce in thi manner he is
suppos to be a thief becaus he is known to be a convict
in anoth instant the thought had occur to him that when he
denounc himself the heroism of hi deed might perhap be taken
into consider and hi honest life for the last seven year and
what he had done for the district and that thei would have merci on
him
but thi supposit vanish veri quickli and he smile bitterli as
he rememb that the theft of the forti sou from littl gervai put
him in the posit of a man guilti of a second offenc after
convict that thi affair would certainli come up and accord to
the precis term of the law would render him liabl to penal
servitud for life
he turn asid from all illus detach himself more and more from
earth and sought strength and consol elsewher he told himself
that he must do hi duti that perhap he should not be more unhappi
after do hi duti than after have avoid it that if he allow
thing to take their own cours if he remain at m sur m hi
consider hi good name hi good work the defer and
vener paid to him hi chariti hi wealth hi popular hi
virtu would be season with a crime and what would be the tast of
all these holi thing when bound up with thi hideou thing while if
he accomplish hi sacrific a celesti idea would be mingl with
the gallei the post the iron necklet the green cap unceas toil
and pitiless shame
at length he told himself that it must be so that hi destini wa thu
allot that he had not author to alter the arrang made on
high that in ani case he must make hi choic virtu without and
abomin within or holi within and infami without
the stir up of these lugubri idea did not caus hi courag to
fail but hi brain grow weari he began to think of other thing of
indiffer matter in spite of himself
the vein in hi templ throb violent he still pace to and fro
midnight sound first from the parish church then from the townhal
he count the twelv stroke of the two clock and compar the
sound of the two bell he recal in thi connect the fact that
a few dai previous he had seen in an ironmong shop an ancient
clock for sale upon which wa written the name antoinealbin de
romainvil
he wa cold he light a small fire it did not occur to him to close
the window
in the meantim he had relaps into hi stupor he wa oblig to make
a toler vigor effort to recal what had been the subject of hi
thought befor midnight had struck he final succeed in do
thi
ah ye he said to himself i had resolv to inform against
myself
and then all of a sudden he thought of fantin
hold said he and what about that poor woman
here a fresh crisi declar itself
fantin by appear thu abruptli in hi reveri produc the effect
of an unexpect rai of light it seem to him as though everyth
about him were undergo a chang of aspect he exclaim
ah but i have hitherto consid no on but myself it is proper for
me to hold my tongu or to denounc myself to conceal my person or to

which weigh onli on myself thi evil action which compromis my soul
alon in that li selfsacrific in that alon there is virtu
he rose and resum hi march thi time he seem to be content
diamond ar found onli in the dark place of the earth truth ar
found onli in the depth of thought it seem to him that after
have descend into these depth after have long grope among the
darkest of these shadow he had at last found on of these diamond
on of these truth and that he now held it in hi hand and he wa
dazzl as he gaze upon it

it turn out that some on is jean valjean at the present moment let
him look out for himself that doe not concern me it is a fatal name
which wa float abroad in the night if it halt and descend on a
head so much the wors for that head
he look into the littl mirror which hung abov hi chimneypiec
and said
hold it ha reliev me to come to a decis i am quit anoth man

he proceed a few pace further then he stop short
come he said i must not flinch befor ani of the consequ of
the resolut which i have onc adopt there ar still thread which
attach me to that jean valjean thei must be broken in thi veri room
there ar object which would betrai me dumb thing which would bear
wit against me it is settl all these thing must disappear
he fumbl in hi pocket drew out hi purs open it and took out a
small kei he insert the kei in a lock whose apertur could hardli be
seen so hidden wa it in the most sombr tone of the design which
cover the wallpap a secret receptacl open a sort of fals
cupboard construct in the angl between the wall and the
chimneypiec in thi hidingplac there were some ragsa blue linen
blous an old pair of trouser an old knapsack and a huge thorn
cudgel shod with iron at both end those who had seen jean valjean at
the epoch when he pass through d in octob 1815 could easili
have recogn all the piec of thi miser outfit
he had preserv them as he had preserv the silver candlestick in
order to remind himself continu of hi startingpoint but he had
conceal all that came from the gallei and he had allow the
candlestick which came from the bishop to be seen
he cast a furtiv glanc toward the door as though he fear that it
would open in spite of the bolt which fasten it then with a quick
and abrupt movement he took the whole in hi arm at onc without
bestow so much as a glanc on the thing which he had so religi
and so peril preserv for so mani year and flung them all
rag cudgel knapsack into the fire
illustr candlestick into the fire
he close the fals cupboard again and with redoubl precaut
henceforth unnecessari sinc it wa now empti he conceal the door
behind a heavi piec of furnitur which he push in front of it
after the laps of a few second the room and the opposit wall were
light up with a fierc red tremul glow everyth wa on fire
the thorn cudgel snap and threw out spark to the middl of the
chamber
as the knapsack wa consum togeth with the hideou rag which it
contain it reveal someth which sparkl in the ash by
bend over on could have readili recogn a coinno doubt the
fortys piec stolen from the littl savoyard
he did not look at the fire but pace back and forth with the same
step
all at onc hi ey fell on the two silver candlestick which shone
vagu on the chimneypiec through the glow
hold he thought the whole of jean valjean is still in them thei
must be destroi also
he seiz the two candlestick
there wa still fire enough to allow of their be put out of shape
and convert into a sort of unrecogniz bar of metal
he bent over the hearth and warm himself for a moment he felt a
sens of real comfort how good warmth is said he
he stir the live coal with on of the candlestick
a minut more and thei were both in the fire
at that moment it seem to him that he heard a voic within him
shout jean valjean jean valjean
hi hair rose upright he becam like a man who is listen to some
terribl thing
ye that it finish said the voic complet what you ar about
destroi these candlestick annihil thi souvenir forget the
bishop forget everyth destroi thi champmathieu do that is
right applaud yourself so it is settl resolv fix agre
here is an old man who doe not know what is want of him who ha
perhap done noth an innoc man whose whole misfortun li in
your name upon whom your name weigh like a crime who is about to be
taken for you who will be condemn who will finish hi dai in
abject and horror that is good be an honest man yourself remain
monsieur le mair remain honor and honor enrich the town
nourish the indig rear the orphan live happi virtuou and
admir and dure thi time while you ar here in the midst of joi
and light there will be a man who will wear your red blous who will
bear your name in ignomini and who will drag your chain in the
gallei ye it is well arrang thu ah wretch
the perspir stream from hi brow he fix a haggard ey on the
candlestick but that within him which had spoken had not finish
the voic continu
jean valjean there will be around you mani voic which will make a
great nois which will talk veri loud and which will bless you and
onli on which no on will hear and which will curs you in the dark
well listen infam man all those benedict will fall back
befor thei reach heaven and onli the maledict will ascend to god
thi voic feebl at first and which had proceed from the most
obscur depth of hi conscienc had gradual becom startl and
formid and he now heard it in hi veri ear it seem to him that
it had detach itself from him and that it wa now speak outsid
of him he thought that he heard the last word so distinctli that he
glanc around the room in a sort of terror
is there ani on here he demand aloud in utter bewilder
then he resum with a laugh which resembl that of an idiot
how stupid i am there can be no on
there wa some on but the person who wa there wa of those whom the
human ey cannot see
he place the candlestick on the chimneypiec
then he resum hi monoton and lugubri tramp which troubl the
dream of the sleep man beneath him and awok him with a start
thi tramp to and fro sooth and at the same time intox him
it sometim seem on suprem occas as though peopl move about
for the purpos of ask advic of everyth that thei mai encount
by chang of place after the laps of a few minut he no longer knew
hi posit
he now recoil in equal terror befor both the resolut at which he
had arriv in turn the two idea which counsel him appear to him
equal fatal what a fatal what conjunct that that champmathieu
should have been taken for him to be overwhelm by precis the
mean which provid seem to have emploi at first to strengthen
hi posit
there wa a moment when he reflect on the futur denounc himself
great god deliv himself up with immens despair he face all that
he should be oblig to leav all that he should be oblig to take up
onc more he should have to bid farewel to that exist which wa
so good so pure so radiant to the respect of all to honor to
liberti he should never more stroll in the field he should never
more hear the bird sing in the month of mai he should never more
bestow alm on the littl children he should never more experi the
sweet of have glanc of gratitud and love fix upon him he
should quit that hous which he had built that littl chamber
everyth seem charm to him at that moment never again should he
read those book never more should he write on that littl tabl of
white wood hi old portress the onli servant whom he kept would
never more bring him hi coffe in the morn great god instead of
that the convict gang the iron necklet the red waistcoat the chain
on hi ankl fatigu the cell the camp bed all those horror which
he knew so well at hi ag after have been what he wa if he were
onli young again but to be address in hi old ag as thou by ani
on who pleas to be search by the convictguard to receiv the
galleyserg cudgel to wear ironbound shoe on hi bare
feet to have to stretch out hi leg night and morn to the hammer of
the roundsman who visit the gang to submit to the curios of
stranger who would be told that man yonder is the famou jean
valjean who wa mayor of m sur m and at night drip with
perspir overwhelm with lassitud their green cap drawn over
their ey to remount two by two the ladder staircas of the gallei
beneath the sergeant whip oh what miseri can destini then be as
malici as an intellig be and becom as monstrou as the human
heart
and do what he would he alwai fell back upon the heartrend dilemma
which lai at the foundat of hi reveri should he remain in
paradis and becom a demon should he return to hell and becom an
angel
what wa to be done great god what wa to be done
the torment from which he had escap with so much difficulti wa
unchain afresh within him hi idea began to grow confus onc
more thei assum a kind of stupefi and mechan qualiti which is
peculiar to despair the name of romainvil recur incessantli to
hi mind with the two vers of a song which he had heard in the past
he thought that romainvil wa a littl grove near pari where young
lover go to pluck lilac in the month of april
he waver outwardli as well as inwardli he walk like a littl child
who is permit to toddl alon
at interv as he combat hi lassitud he made an effort to
recov the masteri of hi mind he tri to put to himself for the
last time and definit the problem over which he had in a manner
fallen prostrat with fatigu ought he to denounc himself ought he
to hold hi peac he could not manag to see anyth distinctli the
vagu aspect of all the cours of reason which had been sketch
out by hi medit quiver and vanish on after the other into
smoke he onli felt that to whatev cours of action he made up hi
mind someth in him must die and that of necess and without hi
be abl to escap the fact that he wa enter a sepulchr on the
right hand as much as on the left that he wa pass through a death
agonyth agoni of hi happi or the agoni of hi virtu
ala all hi resolut had again taken possess of him he wa no
further advanc than at the begin
thu did thi unhappi soul struggl in it anguish eighteen hundr
year befor thi unfortun man the mysteri be in whom ar
sum up all the sanctiti and all the suffer of human had
also long thrust asid with hi hand while the olivetre quiver in
the wild wind of the infinit the terribl cup which appear to him
drip with dark and overflow with shadow in the depth all
stud with star
chapter ivform assum by suffer dure sleep
three oclock in the morn had just struck and he had been walk
thu for five hour almost uninterruptedli when he at length allow
himself to drop into hi chair
there he fell asleep and had a dream
thi dream like the major of dream bore no relat to the
situat except by it pain and heartrend charact but it

we were convers and we met some passersbi we were talk of a
neighbor of our in former dai who had alwai work with her window

wa earth color the man had no hair we could see hi skull and the
vein on it in hi hand he held a switch which wa as suppl as a
vineshoot and as heavi as iron thi horseman pass and said noth

each door behind each tree stood a silent man onli on wa to be

after the laps of some time i turn back and saw a great crowd
come up behind me i recogn all the men whom i had seen in that
town thei had strang head thei did not seem to be in a hurri yet

chapter vhindranc
the post servic from arra to m sur m wa still oper at thi
period by small mailwagon of the time of the empir these
mailwagon were twowheel cabriolet upholst insid with
fawncolor leather hung on spring and have but two seat on
for the postboi the other for the travel the wheel were arm
with those long offens axl which keep other vehicl at a
distanc and which mai still be seen on the road in germani the
despatch box an immens oblong coffer wa place behind the vehicl
and form a part of it thi coffer wa paint black and the
cabriolet yellow
these vehicl which have no counterpart nowadai had someth
distort and hunchback about them and when on saw them pass in
the distanc and climb up some road to the horizon thei resembl
the insect which ar call i think termit and which though with
but littl corselet drag a great train behind them but thei travel
at a veri rapid rate the postwagon which set out from arra at on
oclock everi night after the mail from pari had pass arriv at
m sur m a littl befor five oclock in the morn
that night the wagon which wa descend to m sur m by the hesdin
road collid at the corner of a street just as it wa enter the
town with a littl tilburi har to a white hors which wa go
in the opposit direct and in which there wa but on person a man
envelop in a mantl the wheel of the tilburi receiv quit a
violent shock the postman shout to the man to stop but the
travel paid no heed and pursu hi road at full gallop
that man is in a devilish hurri said the postman
the man thu hasten on wa the on whom we have just seen struggl
in convuls which ar certainli deserv of piti
whither wa he go he could not have told why wa he hasten he
did not know he wa drive at random straight ahead whither to
arra no doubt but he might have been go elsewher as well at
time he wa consciou of it and he shudder he plung into the
night as into a gulf someth urg him forward someth drew him
on no on could have told what wa take place within him everi on
will understand it what man is there who ha not enter at least
onc in hi life into that obscur cavern of the unknown
howev he had resolv on noth decid noth form no plan
done noth none of the action of hi conscienc had been decis
he wa more than ever as he had been at the first moment
why wa he go to arra
he repeat what he had alreadi said to himself when he had hire
scaufflair cabriolet that whatev the result wa to be there wa
no reason why he should not see with hi own ey and judg of matter
for himself that thi wa even prudent that he must know what took
place that no decis could be arriv at without have observ and
scrutin that on made mountain out of everyth from a distanc
that at ani rate when he should have seen that champmathieu some
wretch hi conscienc would probabl be greatli reliev to allow him
to go to the gallei in hi stead that javert would inde be there
and that brevet that chenildieu that cochepail old convict who
had known him but thei certainli would not recogn himbah what an
idea that javert wa a hundr leagu from suspect the truth that
all conjectur and all supposit were fix on champmathieu and
that there is noth so headstrong as supposit and conjectur
that accordingli there wa no danger
that it wa no doubt a dark moment but that he should emerg from
it that after all he held hi destini howev bad it might be in
hi own hand that he wa master of it he clung to thi thought
at bottom to tell the whole truth he would have prefer not to go
to arra
nevertheless he wa go thither
as he medit he whip up hi hors which wa proceed at that
fine regular and even trot which accomplish two leagu and a half
an hour
in proport as the cabriolet advanc he felt someth within him
draw back
at daybreak he wa in the open countri the town of m sur m lai far
behind him he watch the horizon grow white he stare at all the
chilli figur of a winter dawn as thei pass befor hi ey but
without see them the morn ha it spectr as well as the
even he did not see them but without hi be awar of it and by
mean of a sort of penetr which wa almost physic these black
silhouett of tree and of hill ad some gloomi and sinist
qualiti to the violent state of hi soul
each time that he pass on of those isol dwell which
sometim border on the highwai he said to himself and yet there ar
peopl there within who ar sleep
the trot of the hors the bell on the har the wheel on the
road produc a gentl monoton nois these thing ar charm
when on is joyou and lugubri when on is sad
it wa broad daylight when he arriv at hesdin he halt in front of
the inn to allow the hors a breath spell and to have him given
some oat
the hors belong as scaufflair had said to that small race of the
boulonnai which ha too much head too much belli and not enough
neck and shoulder but which ha a broad chest a larg crupper thin
fine leg and solid hoofsa home but a robust and healthi race the
excel beast had travel five leagu in two hour and had not a
drop of sweat on hi loin
he did not get out of the tilburi the stableman who brought the oat
suddenli bent down and examin the left wheel
ar you go far in thi condit said the man
he repli with an air of not have rous himself from hi reveri
why
have you come from a great distanc went on the man
five leagu
ah
why do you sai ah
the man bent down onc more wa silent for a moment with hi ey
fix on the wheel then he rose erect and said
becaus though thi wheel ha travel five leagu it certainli
will not travel anoth quarter of a leagu
he sprang out of the tilburi
what is that you sai my friend
i sai that it is a miracl that you should have travel five leagu
without you and your hors roll into some ditch on the highwai just
see here
the wheel realli had suffer seriou damag the shock administ by
the mailwagon had split two spoke and strain the hub so that the
nut no longer held firm
my friend he said to the stableman is there a wheelwright here
certainli sir

master bourgaillard the wheelwright wa stand on hi own
threshold he came examin the wheel and made a grimac like a

an old calash under the shed yonder which belong to a bourgeoi of
the town who gave it to me to take care of and who onli us it on
the thirtysixth of the monthnev that is to sai i might let that

the stableman and the wheelwright repli in concert with a toss of
the head
no
he felt an immens joi
it wa evid that provid wa interven that it wa it who had
broken the wheel of the tilburi and who wa stop him on the road
he had not yield to thi sort of first summon he had just made
everi possibl effort to continu the journei he had loyal and
scrupul exhaust all mean he had been deter neither by the
season nor fatigu nor by the expens he had noth with which to
reproach himself if he went no further that wa no fault of hi it
did not concern him further it wa no longer hi fault it wa not the
act of hi own conscienc but the act of provid
he breath again he breath freeli and to the full extent of hi
lung for the first time sinc javert visit it seem to him that
the hand of iron which had held hi heart in it grasp for the last
twenti hour had just releas him
it seem to him that god wa for him now and wa manifest himself
he said to himself that he had done all he could and that now he had
noth to do but retrac hi step quietli
if hi convers with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber
of the inn it would have had no wit no on would have heard
him thing would have rest there and it is probabl that we should
not have had to relat ani of the occurr which the reader is about
to perus but thi convers had taken place in the street ani
colloqui in the street inevit attract a crowd there ar alwai
peopl who ask noth better than to becom spectat while he wa
question the wheelwright some peopl who were pass back and
forth halt around them after listen for a few minut a young
lad to whom no on had paid ani heed detach himself from the group
and ran off
at the moment when the travel after the inward deliber which
we have just describ resolv to retrac hi step thi child
return he wa accompani by an old woman
monsieur said the woman my boi tell me that you wish to hire a
cabriolet
these simpl word utter by an old woman led by a child made the
perspir trickl down hi limb he thought that he beheld the hand
which had relax it grasp reappear in the dark behind him readi
to seiz him onc more
he answer
ye my good woman i am in search of a cabriolet which i can hire
and he hasten to add
but there is none in the place
certainli there is said the old woman
where interpol the wheelwright
at my hous repli the old woman
he shudder the fatal hand had grasp him again
the old woman realli had in her shed a sort of basket springcart the
wheelwright and the stableman in despair at the prospect of the
travel escap their clutch interf
it wa a fright old trap it rest flat on the axl it is an
actual fact that the seat were suspend insid it by leather thong
the rain came into it the wheel were rust and eaten with moistur
it would not go much further than the tilburi a regular ramshackl old
stagewagon the gentleman would make a great mistak if he trust
himself to it etc etc
all thi wa true but thi trap thi ramshackl old vehicl thi
thing whatev it wa ran on it two wheel and could go to arra
he paid what wa ask left the tilburi with the wheelwright to be
repair intend to reclaim it on hi return had the white hors
put to the cart climb into it and resum the road which he had
been travel sinc morn
at the moment when the cart move off he admit that he had felt a
moment previous a certain joi in the thought that he should not go
whither he wa now proceed he examin thi joi with a sort of
wrath and found it absurd why should he feel joi at turn back
after all he wa take thi trip of hi own free will no on wa
forc him to it
and assuredli noth would happen except what he should choos
as he left hesdin he heard a voic shout to him stop stop he
halt the cart with a vigor movement which contain a feverish and
convuls element resembl hope
it wa the old woman littl boi
monsieur said the latter it wa i who got the cart for you
well
you have not given me anyth
he who gave to all so readili thought thi demand exorbit and almost
odiou
ah it you you scamp said he you shall have noth
he whip up hi hors and set off at full speed
he had lost a great deal of time at hesdin he want to make it good
the littl hors wa courag and pull for two but it wa the
month of februari there had been rain the road were bad and then
it wa no longer the tilburi the cart wa veri heavi and in addit
there were mani ascent
he took nearli four hour to go from hesdin to saintpol four hour
for five leagu
at saintpol he had the hors unhar at the first inn he came to
and led to the stabl as he had promis scaufflair he stood besid
the manger while the hors wa eat he thought of sad and confus
thing
the innkeep wife came to the stabl
doe not monsieur wish to breakfast
come that is true i even have a good appetit
he follow the woman who had a rosi cheer face she led him to
the public room where there were tabl cover with wax cloth
make hast said he i must start again i am in a hurri
a big flemish servantmaid place hi knife and fork in all hast he
look at the girl with a sensat of comfort
that is what ail me he thought i had not breakfast
hi breakfast wa serv he seiz the bread took a mouth and
then slowli replac it on the tabl and did not touch it again
a carter wa eat at anoth tabl he said to thi man
why is their bread so bitter here
the carter wa a german and did not understand him
he return to the stabl and remain near the hors
an hour later he had quit saintpol and wa direct hi cours
toward tinqu which is onli five leagu from arra
what did he do dure thi journei of what wa he think as in the
morn he watch the tree the thatch roof the till field
pass by and the wai in which the landscap broken at everi turn of
the road vanish thi is a sort of contempl which sometim
suffic to the soul and almost reliev it from thought what is more
melancholi and more profound than to see a thousand object for the
first and the last time to travel is to be born and to die at everi
instant perhap in the vaguest region of hi mind he did make
comparison between the shift horizon and our human exist all
the thing of life ar perpetu flee befor us the dark and
bright interv ar intermingl after a dazzl moment an eclips
we look we hasten we stretch out our hand to grasp what is pass
each event is a turn in the road and all at onc we ar old we feel
a shock all is black we distinguish an obscur door the gloomi hors
of life which ha been draw us halt and we see a veil and
unknown person unhar amid the shadow
twilight wa fall when the children who were come out of school
beheld thi travel enter tinqu it is true that the dai were
still short he did not halt at tinqu as he emerg from the
villag a labor who wa mend the road with stone rais hi
head and said to him
that hors is veri much fatigu
the poor beast wa in fact go at a walk
ar you go to arra ad the roadmend
ye
if you go on at that rate you will not arriv veri earli
he stop hi hors and ask the labor
how far is it from here to arra
nearli seven good leagu
how is that the post guid onli sai five leagu and a quarter
ah return the roadmend so you dont know that the road is
under repair you will find it bar a quarter of an hour further on
there is no wai to proce further
realli
you will take the road on the left lead to carenc you will cross
the river when you reach camblin you will turn to the right that is
the road to montsaintloi which lead to arra
but it is night and i shall lose my wai

reach arra tomorrow
i must be there thi even
that is differ but go to the inn all the same and get an extra
hors the stableboi will guid you through the crossroad
he follow the roadmend advic retrac hi step and half an
hour later he pass the same spot again but thi time at full speed
with a good hors to aid a stableboi who call himself a postilion
wa seat on the shaft of the cariol
still he felt that he had lost time
night had fulli come
thei turn into the crossroad the wai becam frightfulli bad the
cart lurch from on rut to the other he said to the postilion
keep at a trot and you shall have a doubl fee
in on of the jolt the whiffletre broke
there the whiffletre broken sir said the postilion i dont
know how to har my hors now thi road is veri bad at night if
you wish to return and sleep at tinqu we could be in arra earli
tomorrow morn
he repli have you a bit of rope and a knife
ye sir
he cut a branch from a tree and made a whiffletre of it
thi caus anoth loss of twenti minut but thei set out again at a
gallop
the plain wa gloomi lowhang black crisp fog crept over the
hill and wrench themselv awai like smoke there were whitish
gleam in the cloud a strong breez which blew in from the sea
produc a sound in all quarter of the horizon as of some on move
furnitur everyth that could be seen assum attitud of terror
how mani thing shiver beneath these vast breath of the night
he wa stiff with cold he had eaten noth sinc the night befor he
vagu recal hi other nocturn trip in the vast plain in the
neighborhood of d eight year previous and it seem but
yesterdai
the hour struck from a distant tower he ask the boi
what time is it
seven oclock sir we shall reach arra at eight we have but three
leagu still to go
at that moment he for the first time indulg in thi reflect
think it odd the while that it had not occur to him sooner that
all thi troubl which he wa take wa perhap useless that he did
not know so much as the hour of the trial that he should at least
have inform himself of that that he wa foolish to go thu straight
ahead without know whether he would be of ani servic or not then
he sketch out some calcul in hi mind that ordinarili the
sit of the court of assiz began at nine oclock in the morn
that it could not be a long affair that the theft of the appl would
be veri brief that there would then remain onli a question of
ident four or five deposit and veri littl for the lawyer to
sai that he should arriv after all wa over
the postilion whip up the hors thei had cross the river and
left montsaintloi behind them
the night grew more profound

the usher had left him alon the suprem moment had arriv he sought
to collect hi faculti but could not it is chiefli at the moment
when there is the greatest need for attach them to the pain

apart where so mani live had been broken which wa soon to ring
with hi name and which hi fate wa at that moment travers he
stare at the wall then he look at himself wonder that it should
be that chamber and that it should be he
he had eaten noth for four and twenti hour he wa worn out by the
jolt of the cart but he wa not consciou of it it seem to him
that he felt noth
he approach a black frame which wa suspend on the wall and which
contain under glass an ancient autograph letter of jean nicola
pach mayor of pari and minist and date through an error no
doubt the 9th of june of the year ii and in which pach forward
to the commun the list of minist and deputi held in arrest by
them ani spectat who had chanc to see him at that moment and who
had watch him would have imagin doubtless that thi letter
struck him as veri curiou for he did not take hi ey from it and
he read it two or three time he read it without pai ani attent
to it and unconsci he wa think of fantin and cosett
as he dream he turn round and hi ey fell upon the brass knob
of the door which separ him from the court of assiz he had
almost forgotten that door hi glanc calm at first paus there
remain fix on that brass handl then grew terrifi and littl by
littl becam impregn with fear bead of perspir burst forth
among hi hair and trickl down upon hi templ
at a certain moment he made that indescrib gestur of a sort of
author mingl with rebellion which is intend to convei and
which doe so well convei pardieu who compel me to thi then he
wheel briskli round caught sight of the door through which he had
enter in front of him went to it open it and pass out he wa
no longer in that chamber he wa outsid in a corridor a long narrow
corridor broken by step and grate make all sort of angl
light here and there by lantern similar to the night taper of
invalid the corridor through which he had approach he breath he
listen not a sound in front not a sound behind him and he fled as
though pursu
when he had turn mani angl in thi corridor he still listen the
same silenc reign and there wa the same dark around him he
wa out of breath he stagger he lean against the wall the stone
wa cold the perspir lai icecold on hi brow he straighten
himself up with a shiver
then there alon in the dark trembl with cold and with
someth els too perchanc he medit
he had medit all night long he had medit all the dai he heard
within him but on voic which said ala
a quarter of an hour pass thu at length he bow hi head sigh
with agoni drop hi arm and retrac hi step he walk slowli
and as though crush it seem as though some on had overtaken him
in hi flight and wa lead him back
he reenter the councilchamb the first thing he caught sight of
wa the knob of the door thi knob which wa round and of polish
brass shone like a terribl star for him he gaze at it as a lamb
might gaze into the ey of a tiger
he could not take hi ey from it from time to time he advanc a
step and approach the door
had he listen he would have heard the sound of the adjoin hall
like a sort of confus murmur but he did not listen and he did not
hear
suddenli without himself know how it happen he found himself
near the door he grasp the knob convuls the door open
he wa in the courtroom
chapter ixa place where convict ar in process of format
he advanc a pace close the door mechan behind him and
remain stand contempl what he saw
it wa a vast and badli light apart now full of uproar now full
of silenc where all the apparatu of a crimin case with it petti
and mourn graviti in the midst of the throng wa in process of

is call the law and that grand divin thing which is call justic
no on in all that throng paid ani attent to him all glanc were
direct toward a singl point a wooden bench place against a small
door in the stretch of wall on the presid left on thi bench
illumin by sever candl sat a man between two gendarm
thi man wa the man
he did not seek him he saw him hi ey went thither natur as
though thei had known beforehand where that figur wa
he thought he wa look at himself grown old not absolut the
same in face of cours but exactli similar in attitud and aspect
with hi bristl hair with that wild and uneasi ey with that
blous just as it wa on the dai when he enter d full of hatr
conceal hi soul in that hideou mass of fright thought which he
had spent nineteen year in collect on the floor of the prison
he said to himself with a shudder good god shall i becom like that
again
thi creatur seem to be at least sixti there wa someth
indescrib coars stupid and frighten about him
at the sound made by the open door peopl had drawn asid to make
wai for him the presid had turn hi head and understand that
the personag who had just enter wa the mayor of m sur m he had

monstrou aspect of hi past reappear and live onc more around him
with all that there is formid in realiti
all thi wa yawn befor him
he wa horrifi by it he shut hi ey and exclaim in the deepest
recess of hi soul never
and by a tragic plai of destini which made all hi idea trembl and
render him nearli mad it wa anoth self of hi that wa there all
call that man who wa be tri jean valjean
under hi veri ey unheardof vision he had a sort of represent
of the most horribl moment of hi life enact by hi spectr
everyth wa there the apparatu wa the same the hour of the
night the face of the judg of soldier and of spectat all
were the same onli abov the presid head there hung a crucifix
someth which the court had lack at the time of hi condemn
god had been absent when he had been judg
there wa a chair behind him he drop into it terrifi at the
thought that he might be seen when he wa seat he took advantag of
a pile of cardboard box which stood on the judg desk to conceal
hi face from the whole room he could now see without be seen he
had fulli regain conscious of the realiti of thing gradual he
recov he attain that phase of composur where it is possibl to

m bamataboi wa on of the juror
he look for javert but did not see him the seat of the wit
wa hidden from him by the clerk tabl and then as we have just
said the hall wa spare light
at the moment of thi entranc the defend lawyer had just
finish hi plea
the attent of all wa excit to the highest pitch the affair had
last for three hour for three hour that crowd had been watch a
strang man a miser specimen of human either profoundli stupid
or profoundli subtl gradual bend beneath the weight of a
terribl like thi man as the reader alreadi know wa a
vagabond who had been found in a field carri a branch laden with
ripe appl broken in the orchard of a neighbor call the pierron
orchard who wa thi man an examin had been made wit had
been heard and thei were unanim light had abound throughout the
entir debat the accus said we have in our grasp not onli a

old offend who ha broken hi ban an exconvict a miscreant of the
most danger descript a malefactor name jean valjean whom
justic ha long been in search of and who eight year ago on
emerg from the gallei at toulon commit a highwai robberi
accompani by violenc on the person of a child a savoyard name
littl gervai a crime provid for by articl 383 of the penal code
the right to try him for which we reserv hereaft when hi ident
shall have been judici establish he ha just commit a fresh
theft it is a case of a second offenc condemn him for the fresh
deed later on he will be judg for the old crime in the face of
thi accus in the face of the unanim of the wit the
accus appear to be astonish more than anyth els he made
sign and gestur which were meant to convei no or els he stare at
the ceil he spoke with difficulti repli with embarrass but
hi whole person from head to foot wa a denial he wa an idiot in
the presenc of all these mind rang in order of battl around him
and like a stranger in the midst of thi societi which wa seiz fast
upon him nevertheless it wa a question of the most menac futur
for him the like increas everi moment and the entir crowd
survei with more anxieti than he did himself that sentenc
freight with calam which descend ever closer over hi head
there wa even a glimps of a possibl afford besid the
gallei a possibl death penalti in case hi ident were
establish and the affair of littl gervai were to end thereaft in
condemn who wa thi man what wa the natur of hi apathi wa
it imbecil or craft did he understand too well or did he not
understand at all these were question which divid the crowd and
seem to divid the juri there wa someth both terribl and
puzzl in thi case the drama wa not onli melancholi it wa also
obscur
the counsel for the defenc had spoken toler well in that
provinci tongu which ha long constitut the eloqu of the bar
and which wa formerli emploi by all advoc at pari as well as
at romorantin or at montbrison and which todai have becom

to the theft of the applesan awkward matter couch in fine style
but bnign bossuet himself wa oblig to allud to a chicken in the
midst of a funer orat and he extric himself from the
situat in state fashion the lawyer establish the fact that the
theft of the appl had not been circumstanti prove hi client
whom he in hi charact of counsel persist in call
champmathieu had not been seen scale that wall nor break that
branch by ani on he had been taken with that branch which the lawyer
prefer to call a bough in hi possess but he said that he had
found it broken off and ly on the ground and had pick it up
where wa there ani proof to the contrari no doubt that branch had
been broken off and conceal after the scale of the wall then
thrown awai by the alarm maraud there wa no doubt that there had
been a thief in the case but what proof wa there that that thief had
been champmathieu on thing onli hi charact as an exconvict the
lawyer did not deni that that charact appear to be unhappili well
attest the accus had resid at faverol the accus had
exercis the call of a treeprun there the name of champmathieu
might well have had it origin in jean mathieu all that wa truein
short four wit recogn champmathieu posit and without
hesit as that convict jean valjean to these sign to thi
testimoni the counsel could oppos noth but the denial of hi
client the denial of an interest parti but suppos that he wa
the convict jean valjean did that prove that he wa the thief of the
appl that wa a presumpt at the most not a proof the prison
it wa true and hi counsel in good faith wa oblig to admit it
had adopt a bad system of defenc he obstin deni
everyth the theft and hi charact of convict an admiss upon
thi last point would certainli have been better and would have won

with an orator turn calcul to rais the enthusiasm of the

extrem regret that he wa releas at the expir of hi term he

explain to you the affair of waterloo
chapter iiith eighteenth of june 1815
let us turn backthat is on of the storytel rightsand put
ourselv onc more in the year 1815 and even a littl earlier than
the epoch when the action narrat in the first part of thi book took
place
if it had not rain in the night between the 17th and the 18th of
june 1815 the fate of europ would have been differ a few drop
of water more or less decid the downfal of napoleon all that
provid requir in order to make waterloo the end of austerlitz wa
a littl more rain and a cloud travers the sky out of season
suffic to make a world crumbl
the battl of waterloo could not be begun until halfpast eleven
oclock and that gave blcher time to come up why becaus the ground
wa wet the artilleri had to wait until it becam a littl firmer
befor thei could manuvr
napoleon wa an artilleri offic and felt the effect of thi the
foundat of thi wonder captain wa the man who in the report to
the directori on aboukir said such a on of our ball kill six
men all hi plan of battl were arrang for projectil the kei to
hi victori wa to make the artilleri converg on on point he treat
the strategi of the hostil gener like a citadel and made a breach
in it he overwhelm the weak point with grapeshot he join and
dissolv battl with cannon there wa someth of the sharpshoot
in hi geniu to beat in squar to pulver regiment to break
line to crush and dispers massesfor him everyth lai in thi to
strike strike strike incessantlyand he intrust thi task to the
cannonbal a redoubt method and on which unit with geniu
render thi gloomi athlet of the pugil of war invinc for the
space of fifteen year
on the 18th of june 1815 he reli all the more on hi artilleri
becaus he had number on hi side wellington had onli on hundr and
fiftynin mouth of fire napoleon had two hundr and forti
suppos the soil dry and the artilleri capabl of move the action
would have begun at six oclock in the morn the battl would have
been won and end at two oclock three hour befor the chang of
fortun in favor of the prussian what amount of blame attach to
napoleon for the loss of thi battl is the shipwreck due to the
pilot
wa it the evid physic declin of napoleon that complic thi
epoch by an inward diminut of forc had the twenti year of war
worn out the blade as it had worn the scabbard the soul as well as the
bodi did the veteran make himself disastr felt in the leader in
a word wa thi geniu as mani historian of note have thought
suffer from an eclips did he go into a frenzi in order to disguis
hi weaken power from himself did he begin to waver under the
delus of a breath of adventur had he becomea grave matter in a
generalunconsci of peril is there an ag in thi class of
materi great men who mai be call the giant of action when geniu
grow shortsight old ag ha no hold on the genius of the ideal
for the dant and michael angelo to grow old is to grow in great
is it to grow less for the hannib and the bonapart had napoleon
lost the direct sens of victori had he reach the point where he
could no longer recogn the reef could no longer divin the snare
no longer discern the crumbl brink of abyss had he lost hi power
of scent out catastroph he who had in former dai known all the
road to triumph and who from the summit of hi chariot of lightn
point them out with a sovereign finger had he now reach that state
of sinist amaz when he could lead hi tumultu legion
har to it to the precipic wa he seiz at the ag of
fortysix with a suprem mad wa that titan chariot of
destini no longer anyth more than an immens daredevil
we do not think so
hi plan of battl wa by the confess of all a masterpiec to go
straight to the centr of the alli line to make a breach in the
enemi to cut them in two to drive the british half back on hal and
the prussian half on tongr to make two shatter fragment of
wellington and blcher to carri montsaintjean to seiz brussel to
hurl the german into the rhine and the englishman into the sea all
thi wa contain in that battl accord to napoleon afterward
peopl would see
of cours we do not here pretend to furnish a histori of the battl of
waterloo on of the scene of the foundat of the stori which we ar
relat is connect with thi battl but thi histori is not our
subject thi histori moreov ha been finish and finish in a
masterli manner from on point of view by napoleon and from anoth
point of view by a whole pleiad of historians7
as for us we leav the historian at loggerhead we ar but a distant
wit a passerbi on the plain a seeker bend over that soil all
made of human flesh take appear for realiti perchanc we
have no right to oppos in the name of scienc a collect of fact
which contain illus no doubt we possess neither militari practic
nor strateg abil which author a system in our opinion a chain
of accid domin the two leader at waterloo and when it becom
a question of destini that mysteri culprit we judg like that

chapter iva
those person who wish to gain a clear idea of the battl of waterloo
have onli to place mental on the ground a capit a the left limb
of the a is the road to nivel the right limb is the road to
genapp the tie of the a is the hollow road to ohain from
brainelalleud the top of the a is montsaintjean where wellington
is the lower left tip is hougomont where reill is station with
jrme bonapart the right tip is the bellealli where napoleon
wa at the centr of thi chord is the precis point where the final
word of the battl wa pronounc it wa there that the lion ha been
place the involuntari symbol of the suprem heroism of the imperi
guard
the triangl includ in the top of the a between the two limb and
the tie is the plateau of montsaintjean the disput over thi
plateau constitut the whole battl the wing of the two armi

behind the tip of the a behind the plateau of montsaintjean is the
forest of soign

undul sweep of ground each rise command the next rise and all
the undul mount toward montsaintjean and there end in the

with the sagac of foresight had examin it as the possibl seat of
a great battl upon thi spot and for thi duel on the 18th of june
wellington had the good post napoleon the bad post the english armi
wa station abov the french armi below
it is almost superflu here to sketch the appear of napoleon on
horseback glass in hand upon the height of rossomm at daybreak on

chapter vthe quid obscurum of battl
everi on is acquaint with the first phase of thi battl a
begin which wa troubl uncertain hesit menac to both
armi but still more so for the english than for the french
it had rain all night the earth had been cut up by the downpour the
water had accumul here and there in the hollow of the plain as if
in cask at some point the gear of the artilleri carriag wa buri
up to the axl the circingl of the hors were drip with liquid
mud if the wheat and rye trampl down by thi cohort of transport on
the march had not fill in the rut and strewn a litter beneath the
wheel all movement particularli in the vallei in the direct of
papelott would have been imposs
the affair began late napoleon as we have alreadi explain wa in
the habit of keep all hi artilleri well in hand like a pistol
aim it now at on point now at anoth of the battl and it had
been hi wish to wait until the hors batteri could move and gallop
freeli in order to do that it wa necessari that the sun should come
out and dry the soil but the sun did not make it appear it wa
no longer the rendezv of austerlitz when the first cannon wa
fire the english gener colvil look at hi watch and note
that it wa thirtyf minut past eleven
the action wa begun furious with more furi perhap than the
emperor would have wish by the left wing of the french rest on
hougomont at the same time napoleon attack the centr by hurl
quiot brigad on la haiesaint and nei push forward the right
wing of the french against the left wing of the english which rest
on papelott
the attack on hougomont wa someth of a feint the plan wa to draw
wellington thither and to make him swerv to the left thi plan would
have succeed if the four compani of the english guard and the
brave belgian of perponch divis had not held the posit
solidli and wellington instead of mass hi troop there could
confin himself to despatch thither as reinforc onli four
more compani of guard and on battalion from brunswick
the attack of the right wing of the french on papelott wa calcul
in fact to overthrow the english left to cut off the road to
brussel to bar the passag against possibl prussian to forc
montsaintjean to turn wellington back on hougomont thenc on
brainelalleud thenc on hal noth easier with the except of a
few incid thi attack succeed papelott wa taken la

wa equal to ten nevertheless some hanoverian battalion yield
wellington perceiv it and thought of hi cavalri had napoleon at

thi forget wa hi great and fatal mistak
all at onc the cuirassi who had been the assail found
themselv assail the english cavalri wa at their back befor them
two squar behind them somerset somerset meant fourteen hundr
dragoon of the guard on the right somerset had dornberg with the

there were a dozen assault nei had four hors kill under him half

wellington felt that he wa yield the crisi wa at hand
the cuirassi had not succeed sinc the centr wa not broken

and in fact it remain to a great extent with the english
wellington held the villag and the culmin plain nei had onli the

that which must be admir in the battl of waterloo is england the
english firm the english resolut the english blood the superb
thing about england there no offenc to her wa herself it wa not
her captain it wa her armi
wellington oddli ungrat declar in a letter to lord bathurst
that hi armi the armi which fought on the 18th of june 1815 wa a
detest armi what doe that sombr intermingl of bone buri
beneath the furrow of waterloo think of that
england ha been too modest in the matter of wellington to make
wellington so great is to belittl england wellington is noth but a
hero like mani anoth those scotch grai those hors guard those
regiment of maitland and of mitchel that infantri of pack and kempt
that cavalri of ponsonbi and somerset those highland plai the
pibroch under the shower of grapeshot those battalion of rylandt
those utterli raw recruit who hardli knew how to handl a musket
hold their own against essl and rivoli old troopsthat is
what wa grand wellington wa tenaci in that lai hi merit and we
ar not seek to lessen it but the least of hi footsoldi and of
hi cavalri would have been as solid as he the iron soldier is worth
as much as the iron duke as for us all our glorif goe to the
english soldier to the english armi to the english peopl if trophi
there be it is to england that the trophi is due the column of
waterloo would be more just if instead of the figur of a man it
bore on high the statu of a peopl
but thi great england will be angri at what we ar sai here she
still cherish after her own 1688 and our 1789 the feudal illus
she believ in hered and hierarchi thi peopl surpass by none
in power and glori regard itself as a nation and not as a peopl
and as a peopl it willingli subordin itself and take a lord for
it head as a workman it allow itself to be disdain as a soldier
it allow itself to be flog
it will be rememb that at the battl of inkermann a sergeant who
had it appear save the armi could not be mention by lord paglan
as the english militari hierarchi doe not permit ani hero below the
grade of an offic to be mention in the report
that which we admir abov all in an encount of the natur of
waterloo is the marvel clever of chanc a nocturn rain the
wall of hougomont the hollow road of ohain grouchi deaf to the
cannon napoleon guid deceiv him blow guid enlighten

which is all the more curiou and all the more preciou becaus a
popular superstit in the vicin of pari is like an alo in
siberia we ar among those who respect everyth which is in the
natur of a rare plant here then is the superstit of montfermeil
it is thought that the devil from time immemori ha select the
forest as a hidingplac for hi treasur goodwiv affirm that it is
no rariti to encount at nightfal in seclud nook of the forest a
black man with the air of a carter or a woodchopp wear wooden
shoe clad in trouser and a blous of linen and recogniz by the
fact that instead of a cap or hat he ha two immens horn on hi
head thi ought in fact to render him recogniz thi man is
habitu engag in dig a hole there ar three wai of profit
by such an encount the first is to approach the man and speak to
him then it is seen that the man is simpli a peasant that he appear
black becaus it is nightfal that he is not dig ani hole
whatev but is cut grass for hi cow and that what had been
taken for horn is noth but a dungfork which he is carri on hi
back and whose teeth thank to the perspect of even seem to
spring from hi head the man return home and di within the week
the second wai is to watch him to wait until he ha dug hi hole
until he ha fill it and ha gone awai then to run with great speed
to the trench to open it onc more and to seiz the treasur which
the black man ha necessarili place there in thi case on di
within the month final the last method is not to speak to the black
man not to look at him and to flee at the best speed of on leg
on then di within the year
as all three method ar attend with their special inconveni
the second which at all event present some advantag among other
that of possess a treasur if onli for a month is the on most
gener adopt so bold men who ar tempt by everi chanc have
quit frequent as we ar assur open the hole excav by the
black man and tri to rob the devil the success of the oper
appear to be but moder at least if the tradit is to be
believ and in particular the two enigmat line in barbar
latin which an evil norman monk a bit of a sorcer name tryphon

accordingli enorm effort ar made such trench ar ordinarili
extrem deep a man sweat dig toil all nightfor it must be done
at night he wet hi shirt burn out hi candl break hi mattock
and when he arriv at the bottom of the hole when he lai hi hand on
the treasur what doe he find what is the devil treasur a sou

now a veri short time after the epoch when it seem to the
prosecut attornei that the liber convict jean valjean dure hi
flight of sever dai had been prowl around montfermeil it wa
remark in that villag that a certain old roadlabor name
boulatruel had peculiar wai in the forest peopl thereabout
thought thei knew that thi boulatruel had been in the gallei he
wa subject to certain polic supervis and as he could find work
nowher the administr emploi him at reduc rate as a
roadmend on the crossroad from gagni to lagni
thi boulatruel wa a man who wa view with disfavor by the
inhabit of the district as too respect too humbl too prompt
in remov hi cap to everi on and trembl and smile in the
presenc of the gendarmesprob affili to robber band thei
said suspect of ly in ambush at verg of cops at nightfal the
onli thing in hi favor wa that he wa a drunkard
thi is what peopl thought thei had notic
of late boulatruel had taken to quit hi task of stonebreak
and care of the road at a veri earli hour and to betak himself to
the forest with hi pickax he wa encount toward even in the
most desert clear in the wildest thicket and he had the
appear of be in search of someth and sometim he wa
dig hole the goodwiv who pass took him at first for
beelzebub then thei recogn boulatruel and were not in the least
reassur therebi these encount seem to caus boulatruel a
live displeasur it wa evid that he sought to hide and that
there wa some mysteri in what he wa do
it wa said in the villag it is clear that the devil ha appear
boulatruel ha seen him and is on the search in sooth he is
cun enough to pocket lucif hoard
the voltairian ad will boulatruel catch the devil or will the
devil catch boulatruel the old women made a great mani sign of the
cross
in the meantim boulatruel manuvr in the forest ceas and he
resum hi regular occup of roadmend and peopl gossip of
someth els
some person howev were still curiou surmis that in all thi
there wa probabl no fabul treasur of the legend but some fine
windfal of a more seriou and palpabl sort than the devil
bankbil and that the roadmend had half discov the secret
the most puzzl were the schoolmast and thnardier the proprietor
of the tavern who wa everybodi friend and had not disdain to
alli himself with boulatruel
he ha been in the gallei said thnardier eh good god no on
know who ha been there or will be there
on even the schoolmast affirm that in former time the law
would have institut an inquiri as to what boulatruel did in the
forest and that the latter would have been forc to speak and that
he would have been put to the tortur in case of need and that
boulatruel would not have resist the water test for exampl let
us put him to the wine test said thnardier
thei made an effort and got the old roadmend to drink
boulatruel drank an enorm amount but said veri littl he
combin with admir art and in masterli proport the thirst of
a gormand with the discret of a judg nevertheless by dint of
return to the charg and of compar and put togeth the few
obscur word which he did allow to escap him thi is what thnardier
and the schoolmast imagin that thei had made out
on morn when boulatruel wa on hi wai to hi work at daybreak
he had been surpris to see at a nook of the forest in the
underbrush a shovel and a pickax conceal as on might sai
howev he might have suppos that thei were probabl the shovel and
pick of father sixfour the watercarri and would have thought no
more about it but on the even of that dai he saw without be
seen himself as he wa hidden by a larg tree a person who did not
belong in those part and whom he boulatruel knew well direct
hi step toward the densest part of the wood translat by
thnardier a comrad of the gallei boulatruel obstin
refus to reveal hi name thi person carri a packagesometh
squar like a larg box or a small trunk surpris on the part of
boulatruel howev it wa onli after the expir of seven or
eight minut that the idea of follow that person had occur to
him but it wa too late the person wa alreadi in the thicket night
had descend and boulatruel had not been abl to catch up with him
then he had adopt the cours of watch for him at the edg of the
wood it wa moonlight two or three hour later boulatruel had
seen thi person emerg from the brushwood carri no longer the
coffer but a shovel and pick boulatruel had allow the person to
pass and had not dream of accost him becaus he said to himself
that the other man wa three time as strong as he wa and arm with
a pickax and that he would probabl knock him over the head on
recogn him and on perceiv that he wa recogn touch
effus of two old comrad on meet again but the shovel and pick
had serv as a rai of light to boulatruel he had hasten to the
thicket in the morn and had found neither shovel nor pick from
thi he had drawn the infer that thi person onc in the forest
had dug a hole with hi pick buri the coffer and reclos the hole
with hi shovel now the coffer wa too small to contain a bodi
therefor it contain monei henc hi research boulatruel had
explor sound search the entir forest and the thicket and had
dug wherev the earth appear to him to have been recent turn up
in vain
he had ferret out noth no on in montfermeil thought ani more
about it there were onli a few brave gossip who said you mai be
certain that the mender on the gagni road did not take all that troubl

some new thing had come into hi soul
jean valjean had never love anyth for twentyf year he had
been alon in the world he had never been father lover husband

and shy the heart of that exconvict wa full of virgin hi sister
and hi sister children had left him onli a vagu and faroff memori
which had final almost complet vanish he had made everi effort
to find them and not have been abl to find them he had forgotten
them human natur is made thu the other tender emot of hi
youth if he had ever had ani had fallen into an abyss
when he saw cosett when he had taken possess of her carri her
off and deliv her he felt hi heart move within him
all the passion and affect within him awok and rush toward that
child he approach the bed where she lai sleep and trembl with
joi he suffer all the pang of a mother and he knew not what it
meant for that great and singular movement of a heart which begin to
love is a veri obscur and a veri sweet thing
poor old man with a perfectli new heart
onli as he wa five and fifti and cosett eight year of ag all
that might have been love in the whole cours of hi life flow

it wa the second white apparit which he had encount the bishop
had caus the dawn of virtu to rise on hi horizon cosett caus
the dawn of love to rise

cosett on her side had also unknown to herself becom anoth

that she no longer rememb her like all children who resembl

love she had not succeed all had repuls herth thnardier
their children other children she had love the dog and he had di
after which noth and nobodi would have anyth to do with her it
is a sad thing to sai and we have alreadi intim it that at eight
year of ag her heart wa cold it wa not her fault it wa not the
faculti of love that she lack ala it wa the possibl thu

as the color reflect of happi on a garret we all have in our

jean valjean and cosett destini fill in thi gulf destini suddenli
unit and wed with it irresist power these two uproot
exist differ in ag alik in sorrow on in fact complet
the other cosett instinct sought a father as jean valjean
instinct sought a child to meet wa to find each other at the
mysteri moment when their hand touch thei were weld togeth
when these two soul perceiv each other thei recogn each other
as necessari to each other and embrac each other close
take the word in their most comprehens and absolut sens we mai
sai that separ from everi on by the wall of the tomb jean
valjean wa the widow and cosett wa the orphan thi situat
caus jean valjean to becom cosett father after a celesti
fashion
and in truth the mysteri impress produc on cosett in the
depth of the forest of chell by the hand of jean valjean grasp
her in the dark wa not an illus but a realiti the entranc of
that man into the destini of that child had been the advent of god
moreov jean valjean had chosen hi refug well there he seem
perfectli secur
the chamber with a dressingroom which he occupi with cosett wa
the on whose window open on the boulevard thi be the onli
window in the hous no neighbor glanc were to be fear from
across the wai or at the side
the ground floor of number 5052 a sort of dilapid penthous
serv as a wagonhous for marketgarden and no commun
exist between it and the first stori it wa separ by the
floor which had neither trap nor stair and which form the
diaphragm of the build as it were the first stori contain as we
have said numer chamber and sever attic onli on of which wa
occupi by the old woman who took charg of jean valjean
housekeep all the rest wa uninhabit
it wa thi old woman ornament with the name of the princip
lodger and in realiti intrust with the function of portress who
had let him the lodg on christma ev he had repres himself to
her as a gentleman of mean who had been ruin by spanish bond who
wa come there to live with hi littl daughter he had paid her six
month in advanc and had commiss the old woman to furnish the
chamber and dressingroom as we have seen it wa thi good woman who
had light the fire in the stove and prepar everyth on the
even of their arriv
week follow week these two be led a happi life in that hovel
cosett laugh chatter and sang from daybreak children have their
morn song as well as bird
it sometim happen that jean valjean clasp her tini red hand all
crack with chilblain and kiss it the poor child who wa us to
be beaten did not know the mean of thi and ran awai in
confus
at time she becam seriou and stare at her littl black gown
cosett wa no longer in rag she wa in mourn she had emerg
from miseri and she wa enter into life
jean valjean had undertaken to teach her to read sometim as he made
the child spell he rememb that it wa with the idea of do evil
that he had learn to read in prison thi idea had end in teach
a child to read then the exconvict smile with the pensiv smile of
the angel
he felt in it a premedit from on high the will of some on who
wa not man and he becam absorb in reveri good thought have
their abyss as well as evil on
to teach cosett to read and to let her plai thi constitut nearli
the whole of jean valjean exist and then he talk of her
mother and he made her prai
she call him father and knew no other name for him
he pass hour in watch her dress and undress her doll and
in listen to her prattl life henceforth appear to him to be
full of interest men seem to him good and just he no longer
reproach ani on in thought he saw no reason why he should not live
to be a veri old man now that thi child love him he saw a whole
futur stretch out befor him illumin by cosett as by a
charm light the best of us ar not exempt from egotist
thought at time he reflect with a sort of joi that she would be
ugli
thi is onli a person opinion but to utter our whole thought at
the point where jean valjean had arriv when he began to love cosett
it is by no mean clear to us that he did not need thi encourag
in order that he might persever in welldo he had just view the
malic of men and the miseri of societi under a new aspectincomplet
aspect which unfortun onli exhibit on side of the truth the
fate of woman as sum up in fantin and public author as
personifi in javert he had return to prison thi time for have
done right he had quaf fresh bitter disgust and lassitud were
overpow him even the memori of the bishop probabl suffer a
temporari eclips though sure to reappear later on lumin and
triumphant but after all that sacr memori wa grow dim who
know whether jean valjean had not been on the ev of grow
discourag and of fall onc more he love and grew strong again
ala he walk with no less indecis than cosett he protect her
and she strengthen him thank to him she could walk through life
thank to her he could continu in virtu he wa that child stai
and she wa hi prop oh unfathom and divin mysteri of the
balanc of destini
chapter ivth remark of the princip tenant
jean valjean wa prudent enough never to go out by dai everi even
at twilight he walk for an hour or two sometim alon often with
cosett seek the most desert side allei of the boulevard and
enter church at nightfal he like to go to saintmdard which
is the nearest church when he did not take cosett with him she
remain with the old woman but the child delight wa to go out with
the good man she prefer an hour with him to all her raptur
ttett with catherin he held her hand as thei walk and
said sweet thing to her
it turn out that cosett wa a veri gai littl person
the old woman attend to the housekeep and cook and went to
market
thei live soberli alwai have a littl fire but like peopl in
veri moder circumst jean valjean had made no alter in
the furnitur as it wa the first dai he had mere had the glass door
lead to cosett dressingroom replac by a solid door
he still wore hi yellow coat hi black breech and hi old hat in
the street he wa taken for a poor man it sometim happen that
kindheart women turn back to bestow a sou on him jean valjean
accept the sou with a deep bow it also happen occasion that he
encount some poor wretch ask alm then he look behind him to

a few dai afterwardsit might have been at eight oclock in the
eveningh wa in hi room and engag in make cosett spell aloud
when he heard the hous door open and then shut again thi struck him
as singular the old woman who wa the onli inhabit of the hous
except himself alwai went to bed at nightfal so that she might not
burn out her candl jean valjean made a sign to cosett to be quiet
he heard some on ascend the stair it might possibl be the old
woman who might have fallen ill and have been out to the apothecari
jean valjean listen
the step wa heavi and sound like that of a man but the old woman
wore stout shoe and there is noth which so strongli resembl the
step of a man as that of an old woman nevertheless jean valjean blew
out hi candl
he had sent cosett to bed sai to her in a low voic get into bed
veri softli and as he kiss her brow the step paus
jean valjean remain silent motionless with hi back toward the
door seat on the chair from which he had not stir and hold
hi breath in the dark
after the expir of a rather long interv he turn round as he
heard noth more and as he rais hi ey toward the door of hi
chamber he saw a light through the keyhol thi light form a sort
of sinist star in the black of the door and the wall there wa
evid some on there who wa hold a candl in hi hand and
listen
sever minut elaps thu and the light retreat but he heard no
sound of footstep which seem to indic that the person who had
been listen at the door had remov hi shoe
jean valjean threw himself all dress as he wa on hi bed and
could not close hi ey all night
at daybreak just as he wa fall into a doze through fatigu he wa
awaken by the creak of a door which open on some attic at the
end of the corridor then he heard the same masculin footstep which
had ascend the stair on the preced even the step wa
approach he sprang off the bed and appli hi ey to the keyhol
which wa toler larg hope to see the person who had made hi
wai by night into the hous and had listen at hi door as he pass
it wa a man in fact who pass thi time without paus in front
of jean valjean chamber the corridor wa too dark to allow of the
person face be distinguish but when the man reach the
staircas a rai of light from without made it stand out like a
silhouett and jean valjean had a complet view of hi back the man
wa of lofti statur clad in a long frockcoat with a cudgel under
hi arm the formid neck and shoulder belong to javert
jean valjean might have attempt to catch anoth glimps of him
through hi window open on the boulevard but he would have been
oblig to open the window he dare not
it wa evid that thi man had enter with a kei and like himself
who had given him that kei what wa the mean of thi
when the old woman came to do the work at seven oclock in the
morn jean valjean cast a penetr glanc on her but he did not
question her the good woman appear as usual
as she swept up she remark to him
possibl monsieur mai have heard some on come in last night
at that ag and on that boulevard eight oclock in the even wa
the dead of the night
that is true by the wai he repli in the most natur tone
possibl who wa it
it wa a new lodger who ha come into the hous said the old woman
and what is hi name
i dont know exactli dumont or daumont or some name of that sort
and who is thi monsieur dumont
the old woman gaze at him with her littl polecat ey and answer
a gentleman of properti like yourself
perhap she had no ulterior mean jean valjean thought he perceiv
on
when the old woman had taken her departur he did up a hundr franc
which he had in a cupboard into a roll and put it in hi pocket in
spite of all the precaut which he took in thi oper so that he
might not be heard rattl silver a hundreds piec escap from
hi hand and roll noisili on the floor
when dark came on he descend and carefulli scrutin both

the author of thi book who regret the necess of mention
himself ha been absent from pari for mani year pari ha been
transform sinc he quit it a new citi ha arisen which is after
a fashion unknown to him there is no need for him to sai that he
love pari pari is hi mind natal citi in consequ of
demolit and reconstruct the pari of hi youth that pari
which he bore awai religi in hi memori is now a pari of dai
gone by he must be permit to speak of that pari as though it still
exist it is possibl that when the author conduct hi reader to a
spot and sai in such a street there stand such and such a hous
neither street nor hous will ani longer exist in that local
reader mai verifi the fact if thei care to take the troubl for hi
own part he is unacquaint with the new pari and he write with the
old pari befor hi ey in an illus which is preciou to him it
is a delight to him to dream that there still linger behind him
someth of that which he beheld when he wa in hi own countri and
that all ha not vanish so long as you go and come in your nativ
land you imagin that those street ar a matter of indiffer to
you that those window those roof and those door ar noth to
you that those wall ar stranger to you that those tree ar mere
the first encount haphazard that those hous which you do not
enter ar useless to you that the pavement which you tread ar
mere stone later on when you ar no longer there you perceiv
that the street ar dear to you that you miss those roof those
door and that those wall ar necessari to you those tree ar well
belov by you that you enter those hous which you never enter
everi dai and that you have left a part of your heart of your blood
of your soul in those pavement all those place which you no longer
behold which you mai never behold again perchanc and whose memori
you have cherish take on a melancholi charm recur to your mind with
the melancholi of an apparit make the holi land visibl to you and
ar so to speak the veri form of franc and you love them and you
call them up as thei ar as thei were and you persist in thi and
you will submit to no chang for you ar attach to the figur of
your fatherland as to the face of your mother
mai we then be permit to speak of the past in the present that
said we beg the reader to take note of it and we continu
jean valjean instantli quit the boulevard and plung into the

return on hi track at time to make sure that he wa not be

the moon wa full that night jean valjean wa not sorri for thi the
moon still veri close to the horizon cast great mass of light and
shadow in the street jean valjean could glide along close to the
hous on the dark side and yet keep watch on the light side he did
not perhap take suffici into consider the fact that the
dark side escap him still in the desert lane which lie near the
rue poliveau he thought he felt certain that no on wa follow him
cosett walk on without ask ani question the suffer of the
first six year of her life had instil someth passiv into her
natur moreoverand thi is a remark to which we shall frequent
have occas to recursh had grown us without be herself awar
of it to the peculiar of thi good man and to the freak of
destini and then she wa with him and she felt safe
jean valjean knew no more where he wa go than did cosett he
trust in god as she trust in him it seem as though he also were
cling to the hand of some on greater than himself he thought he
felt a be lead him though invis howev he had no settl
idea no plan no project he wa not even absolut sure that it wa
javert and then it might have been javert without javert know that
he wa jean valjean wa not he disguis wa not he believ to be
dead still queer thing had been go on for sever dai he want
no more of them he wa determin not to return to the gorbeau hous
like the wild anim chase from it lair he wa seek a hole in
which he might hide until he could find on where he might dwell
jean valjean describ mani and vari labyrinth in the mouffetard
quarter which wa alreadi asleep as though the disciplin of the
middl ag and the yoke of the curfew still exist he combin in
variou manner with cun strategi the rue censier and the rue
copeau the rue du battoirsaintvictor and the rue du puit lermit
there ar lodg hous in thi local but he did not even enter
on find noth which suit him he had no doubt that if ani on
had chanc to be upon hi track thei would have lost it
as eleven oclock struck from sainttiennedumont he wa travers
the rue de pontois in front of the offic of the commissari of
polic situat at no 14 a few moment later the instinct of which
we have spoken abov made him turn round at that moment he saw
distinctli thank to the commissari lantern which betrai them
three men who were follow him close pass on after the other
under that lantern on the dark side of the street on of the three
enter the allei lead to the commissari hous the on who
march at their head struck him as decidedli suspici
come child he said to cosett and he made hast to quit the rue
pontois
he took a circuit turn into the passag de patriarch which wa
close on account of the hour strode along the rue de lpedeboi
and the rue de larbalt and plung into the rue de post
at that time there wa a squar form by the intersect of street
where the colleg rollin stand todai and where the rue
neuvesaintegenev turn off
it is understood of cours that the rue neuvesaintegenev is an
old street and that a postingchais doe not pass through the rue de
post onc in ten year in the thirteenth centuri thi rue de post
wa inhabit by potter and it real name is rue de pot
the moon cast a livid light into thi open space jean valjean went
into ambush in a doorwai calcul that if the men were still
follow him he could not fail to get a good look at them as thei
travers thi illumin space
in point of fact three minut had not elaps when the men made their
appear there were four of them now all were tall dress in
long brown coat with round hat and huge cudgel in their hand
their great statur and their vast fist render them no less alarm
than did their sinist stride through the dark on would have
pronounc them four spectr disguis as bourgeoi
thei halt in the middl of the space and form a group like men in
consult thei had an air of indecis the on who appear to be
their leader turn round and point hastili with hi right hand in
the direct which jean valjean had taken anoth seem to indic
the contrari direct with consider obstinaci at the moment when
the first man wheel round the moon fell full in hi face jean
valjean recogn javert perfectli
chapter iiit is lucki that the pont dausterlitz bear carriag
uncertainti wa at an end for jean valjean fortun it still last
for the men he took advantag of their hesit it wa time lost
for them but gain for him he slip from under the gate where he
had conceal himself and went down the rue de post toward the
region of the jardin de plant cosett wa begin to be tire he
took her in hi arm and carri her there were no passersbi and the
street lantern had not been light on account of there be a moon
he redoubl hi pace
in a few stride he had reach the goblet potteri on the front of
which the moonlight render distinctli legibl the ancient
inscript
de goblet fil cest ici la fabriqu
venez choisir de cruch et de broc
de pot fleur de tuyaux de la briqu
tout venant le cur vend de carreaux14
he left behind him the rue de la clef then the fountain saintvictor
skirt the jardin de plant by the lower street and reach the
quai there he turn round the quai wa desert the street were
desert there wa no on behind him he drew a long breath
he gain the pont dausterlitz
toll were still collect there at that epoch
he present himself at the toll offic and hand over a sou
it is two sou said the old soldier in charg of the bridg you
ar carri a child who can walk pai for two
he paid vex that hi passag should have arous remark everi
flight should be an impercept slip awai
a heavi cart wa cross the sein at the same time as himself and on
it wai like him to the right bank thi wa of us to him he could
travers the bridg in the shadow of the cart
toward the middl of the bridg cosett whose feet were benumb
want to walk he set her on the ground and took her hand again
the bridg onc cross he perceiv some timberyard on hi right
he direct hi cours thither in order to reach them it wa
necessari to risk himself in a toler larg unshelt and
illumin space he did not hesit those who were on hi track had
evid lost the scent and jean valjean believ himself to be out
of danger hunt ye follow no
a littl street the rue du cheminvertsaintantoin open out
between two timberyard enclos in wall thi street wa dark and
narrow and seem made expressli for him befor enter it he cast a
glanc behind him
from the point where he stood he could see the whole extent of the pont
dausterlitz
four shadow were just enter on the bridg
these shadow had their back turn to the jardin de plant and were
on their wai to the right bank
these four shadow were the four men
jean valjean shudder like the wild beast which is recaptur
on hope remain to him it wa that the men had not perhap
step on the bridg and had not caught sight of him while he wa
cross the larg illumin space hold cosett by the hand
in that case by plung into the littl street befor him he might
escap if he could reach the timberyard the marsh the
marketgarden the uninhabit ground which wa not built upon
it seem to him that he might commit himself to that silent littl
street he enter it
chapter iiito wit the plan of pari in 1727
three hundr pace further on he arriv at a point where the street
fork it separ into two street which ran in a slant line
on to the right and the other to the left
jean valjean had befor him what resembl the two branch of a y
which should he choos he did not hesit but took the on on the
right
why
becaus that to the left ran toward a suburb that is to sai toward
inhabit region and the right branch toward the open countri that
is to sai toward desert region
howev thei no longer walk veri fast cosett pace retard jean
valjean
he took her up and carri her again cosett laid her head on the
shoulder of the good man and said not a word
he turn round from time to time and look behind him he took care
to keep alwai on the dark side of the street the street wa straight
in hi rear the first two or three time that he turn round he saw
noth the silenc wa profound and he continu hi march somewhat
reassur all at onc on turn round he thought he perceiv in
the portion of the street which he had just pass through far off in
the obscur someth which wa move
he rush forward precipit rather than walk hope to find some
sidestreet to make hi escap through it and thu to break hi scent
onc more
he arriv at a wall
thi wall howev did not absolut prevent further progress it wa
a wall which border a transvers street in which the on he had
taken end
here again he wa oblig to come to a decis should he go to the
right or to the left
he glanc to the right the fragmentari lane wa prolong between
build which were either shed or barn then end at a blind
allei the extrem of the culdesac wa distinctli visiblea lofti
white wall
he glanc to the left on that side the lane wa open and about two
hundr pace further on ran into a street of which it wa the
affluent on that side lai safeti
at the moment when jean valjean wa medit a turn to the left in
an effort to reach the street which he saw at the end of the lane he
perceiv a sort of motionless black statu at the corner of the lane
and the street toward which he wa on the point of direct hi
step
it wa some on a man who had evid just been post there and
who wa bar the passag and wait
jean valjean recoil
the point of pari where jean valjean found himself situat between
the faubourg saintantoin and la rpe is on of those which recent

just mention a y of street form by the rue du

the left the name of littl picpu street and on the right the name of
the rue polonceau the two limb of the y were connect at the apex as
by a bar thi bar wa call rue droitmur the rue polonceau end
there rue petitpicpu pass on and ascend toward the lenoir

a right angl in front of him the wall of that street and on hi
right a truncat prolong of the rue droitmur which had no issu

it wa here that jean valjean stood
as we have just said on catch sight of that black silhouett
stand on guard at the angl of the rue droitmur and the rue
petitpicpu he recoil there could be no doubt of it that phantom
wa ly in wait for him
what wa he to do
the time for retreat wa pass that which he had perceiv in
movement an instant befor in the distant dark wa javert and hi
squad without a doubt javert wa probabl alreadi at the commenc
of the street at whose end jean valjean stood javert to all
appear wa acquaint with thi littl labyrinth and had taken
hi precaut by send on of hi men to guard the exit these
surmis which so close resembl proof whirl suddenli like a
hand of dust caught up by an unexpect gust of wind through jean
valjean mourn brain he examin the culdesac genrot there he
wa cut off he examin the rue petitpicpu there stood a sentinel
he saw that black form stand out in relief against the white
pavement illumin by the moon to advanc wa to fall into thi
man hand to retreat wa to fling himself into javert arm jean
valjean felt himself caught as in a net which wa slowli contract
he gaze heavenward in despair
chapter ivth grope of flight
in order to understand what follow it is requisit to form an exact
idea of the droitmur lane and in particular of the angl which on
leav on the left when on emerg from the rue polonceau into thi
lane droitmur lane wa almost entir border on the right as far
as the rue petitpicpu by hous of mean aspect on the left by a
solitari build of sever outlin compos of numer part which
grew gradual higher by a stori or two as thei approach the rue
petitpicpu side so that thi build which wa veri lofti on the
rue petitpicpu side wa toler low on the side adjoin the rue
polonceau there at the angl of which we have spoken it descend to
such a degre that it consist of mere a wall thi wall did not
abut directli on the street it form a deepli retreat nich
conceal by it two corner from two observ who might have been
on in the rue polonceau the other in the rue droitmur
begin with these angl of the nich the wall extend along the
rue polonceau as far as a hous which bore the number 49 and along the
rue droitmur where the fragment wa much shorter as far as the
gloomi build which we have mention and whose gabl it intersect
thu form anoth retreat angl in the street thi gabl wa
sombr of aspect onli on window wa visibl or to speak more
correctli two shutter cover with a sheet of zinc and kept
constantli close
the state of the place of which we ar here give a descript is
rigor exact and will certainli awaken a veri precis memori in
the mind of old inhabit of the quarter
the nich wa entir fill by a thing which resembl a coloss and
wretch door it wa a vast formless assemblag of perpendicular
plank the upper on be broader than the lower bound togeth by
long transvers strip of iron at on side there wa a carriag gate
of the ordinari dimens and which had evid not been cut more
than fifti year previous
a lindentre show it crest abov the nich and the wall wa
cover with ivi on the side of the rue polonceau
in the immin peril in which jean valjean found himself thi sombr
build had about it a solitari and uninhabit look which tempt
him he ran hi ey rapidli over it he said to himself that if he
could contriv to get insid it he might save himself first he
conceiv an idea then a hope
in the central portion of the front of thi build on the rue
droitmur side there were at all the window of the differ stori
ancient cistern pipe of lead the variou branch of the pipe which
led from on central pipe to all these littl basin sketch out a
sort of tree on the front these ramif of pipe with their
hundr elbow imit those old leafless vinestock which writh
over the front of old farmhous
thi odd espali with it branch of lead and iron wa the first
thing that struck jean valjean he seat cosett with her back against
a stone post with an injunct to be silent and ran to the spot
where the conduit touch the pavement perhap there wa some wai of
climb up by it and enter the hous but the pipe wa dilapid
and past servic and hardli hung to it fasten moreov all the
window of thi silent dwell were grate with heavi iron bar even
the attic window in the roof and then the moon fell full upon that
faad and the man who wa watch at the corner of the street would
have seen jean valjean in the act of climb and final what wa to
be done with cosett how wa she to be drawn up to the top of a
threestori hous
he gave up all idea of climb by mean of the drainpip and crawl
along the wall to get back into the rue polonceau
when he reach the slant of the wall where he had left cosett he
notic that no on could see him there as we have just explain he
wa conceal from all ey no matter from which direct thei were
approach besid thi he wa in the shadow final there were
two door perhap thei might be forc the wall abov which he saw
the lindentre and the ivi evid abut on a garden where he
could at least hide himself although there were as yet no leav on
the tree and spend the remaind of the night
time wa pass he must act quickli
he felt over the carriag door and immedi recogn the fact
that it wa impractic outsid and in
he approach the other door with more hope it wa frightfulli
decrepit it veri immens render it less solid the plank were
rotten the iron bandsther were onli three of themwer rust it
seem as though it might be possibl to pierc thi wormeaten
barrier
on examin it he found that the door wa not a door it had neither
hing crossbar lock nor fissur in the middl the iron band
travers it from side to side without ani break through the crevic
in the plank he caught a view of unhewn slab and block of stone
roughli cement togeth which passersbi might still have seen there
ten year ago he wa forc to acknowledg with constern that
thi appar door wa simpli the wooden decor of a build
against which it wa place it wa easi to tear off a plank but then
on found on self face to face with a wall
chapter vwhich would be imposs with ga lantern
at that moment a heavi and measur sound began to be audibl at some
distanc jean valjean risk a glanc round the corner of the street
seven or eight soldier drawn up in a platoon had just debouch into
the rue polonceau he saw the gleam of their bayonet thei were
advanc toward him these soldier at whose head he distinguish
javert tall figur advanc slowli and cautious thei halt
frequent it wa plain that thei were search all the nook of the
wall and all the embrasur of the door and allei
thi wa some patrol that javert had encounteredther could be no
mistak as to thi surmiseand whose aid he had demand
javert two acolyt were march in their rank
at the rate at which thei were march and in consider of the
halt which thei were make it would take them about a quarter of an
hour to reach the spot where jean valjean stood it wa a fright
moment a few minut onli separ jean valjean from that terribl
precipic which yawn befor him for the third time and the gallei
now meant not onli the gallei but cosett lost to him forev that
is to sai a life resembl the interior of a tomb
there wa but on thing which wa possibl
jean valjean had thi peculiar that he carri as on might sai

alarm that corner of the wall of the conciergeri of pari by which

jean valjean measur with hi ey the wall abov which he espi the

thi mass wa about five feet in height the space abov the summit of
thi mass which it wa necessari to climb wa not more than fourteen
feet
the wall wa surmount by a flat stone without a cope
cosett wa the difficulti for she did not know how to climb a wall
should he abandon her jean valjean did not onc think of that it wa
imposs to carri her a man whole strength is requir to
successfulli carri out these singular ascent the least burden would
disturb hi centr of graviti and pull him downward
a rope would have been requir jean valjean had none where wa he to
get a rope at midnight in the rue polonceau certainli if jean
valjean had had a kingdom he would have given it for a rope at that
moment
all extrem situat have their lightn flash which sometim
dazzl sometim illumin us
jean valjean despair glanc fell on the street lanternpost of the
blind allei genrot
at that epoch there were no gasjet in the street of pari at
nightfal lantern place at regular distanc were light thei were
ascend and descend by mean of a rope which travers the street
from side to side and wa adjust in a groov of the post the pullei
over which thi rope ran wa fasten underneath the lantern in a
littl iron box the kei to which wa kept by the lamplight and the
rope itself wa protect by a metal case
jean valjean with the energi of a suprem struggl cross the street
at on bound enter the blind allei broke the latch of the littl
box with the point of hi knife and an instant later he wa besid
cosett onc more he had a rope these gloomi inventor of expedi
work rapidli when thei ar fight against fatal
we have alreadi explain that the lantern had not been light that
night the lantern in the culdesac genrot wa thu natur extinct
like the rest and on could pass directli under it without even
notic that it wa no longer in it place
nevertheless the hour the place the dark jean valjean
absorpt hi singular gestur hi go and come all had
begun to render cosett uneasi ani other child than she would have
given vent to loud shriek long befor she content herself with
pluck jean valjean by the skirt of hi coat thei could hear the
sound of the patrol approach ever more and more distinctli
father said she in a veri low voic i am afraid who is come
yonder
hush repli the unhappi man it is madam thnardier
cosett shudder he ad
sai noth dont interfer with me if you cry out if you weep the
thnardier is ly in wait for you she is come to take you back
then without hast but without make a useless movement with firm
and curt precis the more remark at a moment when the patrol and
javert might come upon him at ani moment he undid hi cravat pass
it round cosett bodi under the armpit take care that it should
not hurt the child fasten thi cravat to on end of the rope by
mean of that knot which seafar men call a swallow knot took the
other end of the rope in hi teeth pull off hi shoe and stock
which he threw over the wall step upon the mass of masonri and
began to rais himself in the angl of the wall and the gabl with as
much solid and certainti as though he had the round of a ladder
under hi feet and elbow half a minut had not elaps when he wa
rest on hi knee on the wall
cosett gaze at him in stupid amaz without utter a word jean
valjean injunct and the name of madam thnardier had chill
her blood
all at onc she heard jean valjean voic cry to her though in a
veri low tone
put your back against the wall
she obei
dont sai a word and dont be alarm went on jean valjean
and she felt herself lift from the ground
befor she had time to recov herself she wa on the top of the wall
jean valjean grasp her put her on hi back took her two tini hand
in hi larg left hand lai down flat on hi stomach and crawl along
on top of the wall as far as the cant as he had guess there stood a
build whose roof start from the top of the wooden barricad and
descend to within a veri short distanc of the ground with a gentl
slope which graze the lindentre a lucki circumst for the wall
wa much higher on thi side than on the street side jean valjean
could onli see the ground at a great depth below him
he had just reach the slope of the roof and had not yet left the
crest of the wall when a violent uproar announc the arriv of the
patrol the thunder voic of javert wa audibl
search the blind allei the rue droitmur is guard so is the rue
petitpicpu ill answer for it that he is in the blind allei
the soldier rush into the genrot allei
jean valjean allow himself to slide down the roof still hold fast
to cosett reach the lindentre and leap to the ground whether
from terror or courag cosett had not breath a sound though her
hand were a littl abrad
chapter vith begin of an enigma
jean valjean found himself in a sort of garden which wa veri vast and
of singular aspect on of those melancholi garden which seem made to
be look at in winter and at night thi garden wa oblong in shape
with an allei of larg poplar at the further end toler tall
forest tree in the corner and an unshad space in the centr where
could be seen a veri larg solitari tree then sever fruittre
gnarl and bristl like bush bed of veget a melon patch
whose glass frame sparkl in the moonlight and an old well here and
there stood stone bench which seem black with moss the allei were
border with gloomi and veri erect littl shrub the grass had half
taken possess of them and a green mould cover the rest
jean valjean had besid him the build whose roof had serv him as a
mean of descent a pile of fagot and behind the fagot directli
against the wall a stone statu whose mutil face wa no longer
anyth more than a shapeless mask which loom vagu through the
gloom
the build wa a sort of ruin where dismantl chamber were
distinguish on of which much encumb seem to serv as a
shed
the larg build of the rue droitmur which had a wing on the rue
petitpicpu turn two faad at right angl toward thi garden
these interior faad were even more tragic than the exterior all the
window were grate not a gleam of light wa visibl at ani on of
them the upper stori had scuttl like prison on of those faad
cast it shadow on the other which fell over the garden like an
immens black pall
no other hous wa visibl the bottom of the garden wa lost in mist
and dark nevertheless wall could be confusedli made out which
intersect as though there were more cultiv land beyond and the
low roof of the rue polonceau
noth more wild and solitari than thi garden could be imagin
there wa no on in it which wa quit natur in view of the hour
but it did not seem as though thi spot were made for ani on to walk
in even in broad daylight
jean valjean first care had been to get hold of hi shoe and put
them on again then to step under the shed with cosett a man who is
flee never think himself suffici hidden the child whose
thought were still on the thnardier share hi instinct for
withdraw from sight as much as possibl
cosett trembl and press close to him thei heard the tumultu
nois of the patrol search the blind allei and the street the
blow of their gunstock against the stone javert appeal to the
polic spi whom he had post and hi imprec mingl with
word which could not be distinguish
at the expir of a quarter of an hour it seem as though that
speci of stormi roar were becom more distant jean valjean held
hi breath
he had laid hi hand lightli on cosett mouth
howev the solitud in which he stood wa so strang calm that
thi fright uproar close and furiou as it wa did not disturb him
by so much as the shadow of a misgiv it seem as though those
wall had been built of the deaf stone of which the scriptur speak
all at onc in the midst of thi profound calm a fresh sound aros a
sound as celesti divin ineff ravish as the other had been
horribl it wa a hymn which issu from the gloom a dazzl burst
of prayer and harmoni in the obscur and alarm silenc of the night
women voic but voic compos at on and the same time of the
pure accent of virgin and the innoc accent of childrenvoic
which ar not of the earth and which resembl those that the newborn
infant still hear and which the dy man hear alreadi thi song
proceed from the gloomi edific which tower abov the garden at
the moment when the hubbub of demon retreat on would have said
that a choir of angel wa approach through the gloom
cosett and jean valjean fell on their knee
thei knew not what it wa thei knew not where thei were but both of
them the man and the child the penit and the innoc felt that
thei must kneel
these voic had thi strang characterist that thei did not prevent
the build from seem to be desert it wa a supernatur chant
in an uninhabit hous
while these voic were sing jean valjean thought of noth he no
longer beheld the night he beheld a blue sky it seem to him that he
felt those wing which we all have within us unfold
the song di awai it mai have last a long time jean valjean could
not have told hour of ecstasi ar never more than a moment
all fell silent again there wa no longer anyth in the street
there wa noth in the garden that which had menac that which had
reassur himal had vanish the breez swai a few dry weed on
the crest of the wall and thei gave out a faint sweet melancholi
sound
chapter viicontinu of the enigma
the night wind had risen which indic that it must be between on
and two oclock in the morn poor cosett said noth as she had
seat herself besid him and lean her head against him jean valjean
had fanci that she wa asleep he bent down and look at her
cosett ey were wide open and her thought air pain jean
valjean
she wa still trembl
ar you sleepi said jean valjean
i am veri cold she repli
a moment later she resum
is she still there
who said jean valjean
madam thnardier
jean valjean had alreadi forgotten the mean which he had emploi to
make cosett keep silent
ah said he she is gone you need fear noth further
the child sigh as though a load had been lift from her breast
the ground wa damp the shed open on all side the breez grew more
keen everi instant the goodman took off hi coat and wrap it round
cosett
ar you less cold now said he
oh ye father
well wait for me a moment i will soon be back
he quit the ruin and crept along the larg build seek a
better shelter he came across door but thei were close there were
bar at all the window of the ground floor
just after he had turn the inner angl of the edific he observ
that he wa come to some arch window where he perceiv a light
he stood on tipto and peep through on of these window thei all
open on a toler vast hall pave with larg flagston cut up by
arcad and pillar where onli a tini light and great shadow were
visibl the light came from a taper which wa burn in on corner
the apart wa desert and noth wa stir in it
nevertheless by dint of gaze intent he thought he perceiv on the
ground someth which appear to be cover with a windingsheet and
which resembl a human form thi form wa ly face downward flat
on the pavement with the arm extend in the form of a cross in the
immobl of death on would have said judg from a sort of
serpent which undul over the floor that thi sinist form had a
rope round it neck
the whole chamber wa bath in that mist of place which ar spare
illumin which add to horror
jean valjean often said afterward that although mani funer
spectr had cross hi path in life he had never beheld anyth
more bloodcurdl and terribl than that enigmat form
accomplish some inexplic mysteri in that gloomi place and
beheld thu at night it wa alarm to suppos that that thing wa
perhap dead and still more alarm to think that it wa perhap
aliv
he had the courag to plaster hi face to the glass and to watch
whether the thing would move in spite of hi remain thu what
seem to him a veri long time the outstretch form made no movement
all at onc he felt himself overpow by an inexpress terror and
he fled he began to run toward the shed not dare to look behind
him it seem to him that if he turn hi head he should see that
form follow him with great stride and wave it arm
he reach the ruin all out of breath hi knee were give wai
beneath him the perspir wa pour from him
where wa he who could ever have imagin anyth like that sort of
sepulchr in the midst of pari what wa thi strang hous an
edific full of nocturn mysteri call to soul through the
dark with the voic of angel and when thei came offer them
abruptli that terribl vision promis to open the radiant portal of
heaven and then open the horribl gate of the tomb and it
actual wa an edific a hous which bore a number on the street it
wa not a dream he had to touch the stone to convinc himself that
such wa the fact
cold anxieti uneasi the emot of the night had given him a
genuin fever and all these idea were clash togeth in hi brain
he step up to cosett she wa asleep
chapter viiith enigma becom doubli mysteri
the child had laid her head on a stone and fallen asleep
he sat down besid her and began to think littl by littl as he
gaze at her he grew calm and regain possess of hi freedom of
mind
he clearli perceiv thi truth the foundat of hi life henceforth
that so long as she wa there so long as he had her near him he
should need noth except for her he should fear noth except for
her he wa not even consciou that he wa veri cold sinc he had
taken off hi coat to cover her
nevertheless athwart thi reveri into which he had fallen he had
heard for some time a peculiar nois it wa like the tinkl of a
bell thi sound proceed from the garden it could be heard
distinctli though faintli it resembl the faint vagu music produc
by the bell of cattl at night in the pastur
thi nois made valjean turn round
he look and saw that there wa some on in the garden
a be resembl a man wa walk amid the bellglass of the melon
bed rise stoop halt with regular movement as though he
were drag or spread out someth on the ground thi person
appear to limp
jean valjean shudder with the continu tremor of the unhappi for
them everyth is hostil and suspici thei distrust the dai
becaus it enabl peopl to see them and the night becaus it aid in
surpris them a littl while befor he had shiver becaus the
garden wa desert and now he shiver becaus there wa some on
there
he fell back from chimer terror to real terror he said to
himself that javert and the spi had perhap not taken their
departur that thei had no doubt left peopl on the watch in the
street that if thi man should discov him in the garden he would
cry out for help against thiev and deliv him up he took the
sleep cosett gentli in hi arm and carri her behind a heap of
old furnitur which wa out of us in the most remot corner of the
shed cosett did not stir
from that point he scrutin the appear of the be in the melon
patch the strang thing about it wa that the sound of the bell
follow each of thi man movement when the man approach the
sound approach when the man retreat the sound retreat if he
made ani hasti gestur a tremolo accompani the gestur when he
halt the sound ceas it appear evid that the bell wa
attach to that man but what could that signifi who wa thi man who
had a bell suspend about him like a ram or an ox
as he put these question to himself he touch cosett hand thei
were ici cold
ah good god he cri
he spoke to her in a low voic
cosett
she did not open her ey
he shook her vigor
she did not wake
is she dead he said to himself and sprang to hi feet quiver
from head to foot
the most fright thought rush pellmel through hi mind there
ar moment when hideou surmis assail us like a cohort of furi
and violent forc the partit of our brain when those we love
ar in question our prudenc invent everi sort of mad he
rememb that sleep in the open air on a cold night mai be fatal
cosett wa pale and had fallen at full length on the ground at hi
feet without a movement
he listen to her breath she still breath but with a
respir which seem to him weak and on the point of extinct
how wa he to warm her back to life how wa he to rous her all that
wa not connect with thi vanish from hi thought he rush
wildli from the ruin
it wa absolut necessari that cosett should be in bed and besid a
fire in less than a quarter of an hour
chapter ixth man with the bell
he walk straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden he had
taken in hi hand the roll of silver which wa in the pocket of hi
waistcoat
the man head wa bent down and he did not see him approach in a
few stride jean valjean stood besid him
jean valjean accost him with the cry

the moon shone full upon jean valjean terrifi counten

by that strang man made jean valjean start back
he had expect anyth but that the person who thu address him

the event of which we have just beheld the revers side so to speak
had come about in the simplest possibl manner
when jean valjean on the even of the veri dai when javert had
arrest him besid fantin deathb had escap from the town jail
of m sur m the polic had suppos that he had betaken himself to
pari pari is a maelstrom where everyth is lost and everyth
disappear in thi belli of the world as in the belli of the sea no

thi thei go to pari as to an abyss there ar gulf which save the
polic know it also and it is in pari that thei seek what thei have
lost elsewher thei sought the exmayor of m sur m javert wa
summon to pari to throw light on their research javert had in
fact render power assist in the recaptur of jean valjean
javert zeal and intellig on that occas had been remark by m
chabouillet secretari of the prefectur under comt angl m
chabouillet who had moreov alreadi been javert patron had the
inspector of m sur m attach to the polic forc of pari there
javert render himself us in diver and though the word mai seem
strang for such servic honor manner
he no longer thought of jean valjeanth wolf of todai caus these
dog who ar alwai on the chase to forget the wolf of yesterdaywhen
in decemb 1823 he read a newspap he who never read newspap
but javert a monarch man had a desir to know the particular of
the triumphal entri of the princ generalissimo into bayonn just as
he wa finish the articl which interest him a name the name of
jean valjean attract hi attent at the bottom of a page the
paper announc that the convict jean valjean wa dead and publish
the fact in such formal term that javert did not doubt it he confin
himself to the remark that a good entri then he threw asid the
paper and thought no more about it
some time afterward it chanc that a polic report wa transmit
from the prefectur of the seineetois to the prefectur of polic in

thi report came under javert ey and set him to think
the name of fantin wa well known to him he rememb that jean
valjean had made him javert burst into laughter by ask him for a
respit of three dai for the purpos of go to fetch that
creatur child he recal the fact that jean valjean had been

coach for montfermeil some sign had made him suspect at the time that
thi wa the second occas of hi enter that coach and that he
had alreadi on the previou dai made an excurs to the neighborhood
of that villag for he had not been seen in the villag itself what
had he been intend to do in that region of montfermeil it could not
even be surmis javert understood it now fantin daughter wa
there jean valjean wa go there in search of her and now thi
child had been stolen by a stranger who could that stranger be could
it be jean valjean but jean valjean wa dead javert without sai
anyth to anybodi took the coach from the pewter platter
culdesac de la planchett and made a trip to montfermeil
he expect to find a great deal of light on the subject there he
found a great deal of obscur
for the first few dai the thnardier had chatter in their rage the
disappear of the lark had creat a sensat in the villag he
immedi obtain numer version of the stori which end in the
abduct of a child henc the polic report but their first vexat
have pass off thnardier with hi wonder instinct had veri
quickli comprehend that it is never advis to stir up the
prosecutor of the crown and that hi complaint with regard to the
abduct of cosett would have as their first result to fix upon
himself and upon mani dark affair which he had on hand the
glitter ey of justic the last thing that owl desir is to have a
candl brought to them and in the first place how explain the fifteen
hundr franc which he had receiv he turn squar round put a
gag on hi wife mouth and feign astonish when the stolen
child wa mention to him he understood noth about it no doubt
he had grumbl for awhil at have that dear littl creatur taken
from him so hastili he should have like to keep her two or three
dai longer out of tender but her grandfath had come for her
in the most natur wai in the world he ad the grandfath which
produc a good effect thi wa the stori that javert hit upon when he
arriv at montfermeil the grandfath caus jean valjean to vanish
nevertheless javert drop a few question like plummet into
thnardier histori who wa that grandfath and what wa hi
name thnardier repli with simplic he is a wealthi farmer i
saw hi passport i think hi name wa m guillaum lambert
lambert is a respect and extrem reassur name thereupon
javert return to pari
jean valjean is certainli dead said he and i am a ninni
he had again begun to forget thi histori when in the cours of

order to get a close look at thi fantast gentleman without alarm
him he borrow the beadl outfit for a dai and the place where the
old spy wa in the habit of crouch everi even whine orison
through hi nose and plai the spy under cover of prayer
the suspect individu did inde approach javert thu disguis
and bestow alm on him at that moment javert rais hi head and the
shock which jean valjean receiv on recogn javert wa equal to
the on receiv by javert when he thought he recogn jean valjean
howev the dark might have misl him jean valjean death wa
offici javert cherish veri grave doubt and when in doubt
javert the man of scrupl never laid a finger on ani on collar
he follow hi man to the gorbeau hous and got the old woman to
talk which wa no difficult matter the old woman confirm the
fact regard the coat line with million and narrat to him the
episod of the thousandfranc bill she had seen it she had handl

javert had demand assist at the prefectur but he had not
mention the name of the individu whom he hope to seiz that wa
hi secret and he had kept it for three reason in the first place
becaus the slightest indiscret might put jean valjean on the alert
next becaus to lai hand on an exconvict who had made hi escap
and wa reput dead on a crimin whom justic had formerli class
forev as among malefactor of the most danger sort wa a
magnific success which the old member of the parisian polic would
assuredli not leav to a newcom like javert and he wa afraid of
be depriv of hi convict and lastli becaus javert be an
artist had a tast for the unforeseen he hate those wellherald
success which ar talk of long in advanc and have had the bloom
brush off he prefer to elabor hi masterpiec in the dark and
to unveil them suddenli at the last
javert had follow jean valjean from tree to tree then from corner to
corner of the street and had not lost sight of him for a singl
instant even at the moment when jean valjean believ himself to be
the most secur javert ey had been on him why had not javert
arrest jean valjean becaus he wa still in doubt
it must be rememb that at that epoch the polic wa not precis
at it eas the free press embarrass it sever arbitrari arrest
denounc by the newspap had echo even as far as the chamber
and had render the prefectur timid interfer with individu
liberti wa a grave matter the polic agent were afraid of make a
mistak the prefect laid the blame on them a mistak meant dismiss
the reader can imagin the effect which thi brief paragraph
reproduc by twenti newspap would have caus in pari
yesterdai an ag grandfath with white hair a respect and
welltodo gentleman who wa walk with hi grandchild ag eight
wa arrest and conduct to the agenc of the prefectur as an
escap convict
let us repeat in addit that javert had scrupl of hi own
injunct of hi conscienc were ad to the injunct of the
prefect he wa realli in doubt
jean valjean turn hi back on him and walk in the dark
sad uneasi anxieti depress thi fresh misfortun of
be forc to flee by night to seek a chanc refug in pari for
cosett and himself the necess of regul hi pace to the pace
of the childal thi without hi be awar of it had alter jean
valjean walk and impress on hi bear such senil that the
polic themselv incarn in the person of javert might and did in
fact make a mistak the imposs of approach too close hi
costum of an migr preceptor the declar of thnardier which
made a grandfath of him and final the belief in hi death in
prison ad still further to the uncertainti which gather thick in
javert mind
for an instant it occur to him to make an abrupt demand for hi
paper but if the man wa not jean valjean and if thi man wa not a
good honest old fellow live on hi incom he wa probabl some
merri blade deepli and cunningli implic in the obscur web of
parisian misde some chief of a danger band who gave alm to
conceal hi other talent which wa an old dodg he had trusti
fellow accomplic retreat in case of emerg in which he
would no doubt take refug all these turn which he wa make
through the street seem to indic that he wa not a simpl and
honest man to arrest him too hastili would be to kill the hen that
laid the golden egg where wa the inconveni in wait javert
wa veri sure that he would not escap
thu he proceed in a toler perplex state of mind put to
himself a hundr question about thi enigmat personag
it wa onli quit late in the rue de pontois that thank to the
brilliant light thrown from a dramshop he decidedli recogn jean
valjean
there ar in thi world two be who give a profound startth
mother who recov her child and the tiger who recov hi prei
javert gave that profound start
as soon as he had posit recogn jean valjean the formid
convict he perceiv that there were onli three of them and he ask
for reinforc at the polic station of the rue de pontois on
put on glove befor grasp a thorn cudgel
thi delai and the halt at the carrefour rollin to consult with hi
agent came near caus him to lose the trail he speedili divin
howev that jean valjean would want to put the river between hi
pursuer and himself he bent hi head and reflect like a bloodhound
who put hi nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the right
scent javert with hi power rectitud of instinct went straight
to the bridg of austerlitz a word with the tollkeep furnish him
with the inform which he requir have you seen a man with a
littl girl i made him pai two sou repli the tollkeep
javert reach the bridg in season to see jean valjean travers the
small illumin spot on the other side of the water lead cosett
by the hand he saw him enter the rue du cheminvertsaintantoin he
rememb the culdesac genrot arrang there like a trap and of the
sole exit of the rue droitmur into the rue petitpicpu he made sure
of hi back burrow as huntsmen sai he hastili despatch on of hi
agent by a roundabout wai to guard that issu a patrol which wa
return to the arsen post have pass him he made a requisit
on it and caus it to accompani him in such game soldier ar ac
moreov the principl is that in order to get the best of a wild
boar on must emploi the scienc of veneri and plenti of dog these
combin have been effect feel that jean valjean wa caught
between the blind allei genrot on the right hi agent on the left and
himself javert in the rear he took a pinch of snuff
then he began the game he experienc on ecstat and infern
moment he allow hi man to go on ahead know that he had him
safe but desir of postpon the moment of arrest as long as
possibl happi at the thought that he wa taken and yet at see him
free gloat over him with hi gaze with that voluptu of the
spider which allow the fly to flutter and of the cat which let the
mous run claw and talon possess a monstrou sensualityth obscur
movement of the creatur imprison in their pincer what a delight
thi strangl is
javert wa enjoi himself the mesh of hi net were stoutli
knot he wa sure of success all he had to do now wa to close hi
hand
accompani as he wa the veri idea of resist wa imposs
howev vigor energet and desper jean valjean might be
illustr javert on the hunt
javert advanc slowli sound search on hi wai all the nook of
the street like so mani pocket of thiev
when he reach the centr of the web he found the fly no longer there
hi exasper can be imagin
he interrog hi sentinel of the rue droitmur and petitpicpu
that agent who had remain imperturb at hi post had not seen
the man pass
it sometim happen that a stag is lost head and horn that is to
sai he escap although he ha the pack on hi veri heel and then
the oldest huntsmen know not what to sai duvivi lignivil and
desprez halt short in a discomfitur of thi sort artong exclaim
it wa not a stag but a sorcer javert would have like to utter
the same cry
hi disappoint border for a moment on despair and rage
it is certain that napoleon made mistak dure the war with russia
that alexand commit blunder in the war in india that csar made
mistak in the war in africa that cyru wa at fault in the war in
scythia and that javert blunder in thi campaign against jean
valjean he wa wrong perhap in hesit in hi recognit of the
exconvict the first glanc should have suffic him he wa wrong in
not arrest him pure and simpli in the old build he wa wrong
in not arrest him when he posit recogn him in the rue de
pontois he wa wrong in take counsel with hi auxiliari in the
full light of the moon in the carrefour rollin advic is certainli
us it is a good thing to know and to interrog those of the dog
who deserv confid but the hunter cannot be too cautiou when he
is chase uneasi anim like the wolf and the convict javert by
take too much thought as to how he should set the bloodhound of the
pack on the trail alarm the beast by give him wind of the dart
and so made him run abov all he wa wrong in that after he had
pick up the scent again on the bridg of austerlitz he plai that
formid and pueril game of keep such a man at the end of a
thread he thought himself stronger than he wa and believ that he
could plai at the game of the mous and the lion at the same time he
reckon himself as too weak when he judg it necessari to obtain
reinforc fatal precaut wast of preciou time javert
commit all these blunder and nonetheless wa on of the cleverest
and most correct spi that ever exist he wa in the full forc of
the term what is call in veneri a know dog but what is there
that is perfect
great strategist have their eclips
the greatest folli ar often compos like the largest rope of a
multitud of strand take the cabl thread by thread take all the
petti determin motiv separ and you can break them on after
the other and you sai that is all there is of it braid them twist
them togeth the result is enorm it is attila hesit between
marcian on the east and valentinian on the west it is hannib
tarri at capua it is danton fall asleep at arcissuraub
howev that mai be even at the moment when he saw that jean valjean
had escap him javert did not lose hi head sure that the convict
who had broken hi ban could not be far off he establish sentinel
he organ trap and ambuscad and beat the quarter all that night
the first thing he saw wa the disord in the street lantern whose
rope had been cut a preciou sign which howev led him astrai
sinc it caus him to turn all hi research in the direct of the
culdesac genrot in thi blind allei there were toler low wall
which abut on garden whose bound adjoin the immens stretch of
wast land jean valjean evid must have fled in that direct
the fact is that had he penetr a littl further in the culdesac
genrot he would probabl have done so and have been lost javert
explor these garden and these wast stretch as though he had been
hunt for a needl
at daybreak he left two intellig men on the outlook and return to
the prefectur of polic as much asham as a polic spy who had been

window on that discreet retreat the reader will permit us on other
littl digress utterli foreign to thi book but characterist and
us sinc it show that the cloister even ha it origin figur
in the littl convent there wa a centenarian who came from the abbei
of fontevrault she had even been in societi befor the revolut she
talk a great deal of m de miromesnil keeper of the seal under
loui xvi and of a presidentess duplat with whom she had been veri
intim it wa her pleasur and her vaniti to drag in these name on
everi pretext she told wonder of the abbei of fontevraultthat it
wa like a citi and that there were street in the monasteri
she talk with a picard accent which amus the pupil everi year
she solemnli renew her vow and at the moment of take the oath
she said to the priest monseigneur saintfranoi gave it to
monseigneur saintjulien monseigneur saintjulien gave it to
monseigneur sainteusebiu monseigneur sainteusebiu gave it to
monseigneur saintprocopiu etc etc and thu i give it to you
father and the schoolgirl would begin to laugh not in their
sleev but under their veil charm littl stifl laugh which
made the vocal mother frown
on anoth occas the centenarian wa tell stori she said that
in her youth the bernardin monk were everi whit as good as the
mousquetair it wa a centuri which spoke through her but it wa
the eighteenth centuri she told about the custom of the four wine
which exist befor the revolut in champagn and bourgogn when a
great personag a marshal of franc a princ a duke and a peer
travers a town in burgundi or champagn the citi father came out to
harangu him and present him with four silver gondola into which
thei had pour four differ sort of wine on the first goblet thi
inscript could be read monkei wine on the second lion wine
on the third sheep wine on the fourth hog wine these four
legend express the four stage descend by the drunkard the first
intox which enliven the second that which irrit the
third that which dull and the fourth that which brutal
in a cupboard under lock and kei she kept a mysteri object of
which she thought a great deal the rule of fontevrault did not forbid
thi she would not show thi object to anyon she shut herself up
which her rule allow her to do and hid herself everi time that she
desir to contempl it if she heard a footstep in the corridor she
close the cupboard again as hastili as it wa possibl with her ag
hand as soon as it wa mention to her she becam silent she who
wa so fond of talk the most curiou were baffl by her silenc
and the most tenaci by her obstinaci thu it furnish a subject of
comment for all those who were unoccupi or bore in the convent what
could that treasur of the centenarian be which wa so preciou and so
secret some holi book no doubt some uniqu chaplet some authent
relic thei lost themselv in conjectur when the poor old woman
di thei rush to her cupboard more hastili than wa fit
perhap and open it thei found the object beneath a tripl linen
cloth like some consecr paten it wa a faenza platter
repres littl love flit awai pursu by apothecari lad
arm with enorm syring the chase abound in grimac and in
comic postur on of the charm littl love is alreadi fairli
spit he is resist flutter hi tini wing and still make
an effort to fly but the dancer is laugh with a satan air
moral love conquer by the colic thi platter which is veri
curiou and which had possibl the honor of furnish molir with
an idea wa still in exist in septemb 1845 it wa for sale by
a bricbrac merchant in the boulevard beaumarchai
thi good old woman would not receiv ani visit from outsid
becaus said she the parlor is too gloomi
chapter xorigin of the perpetu ador
howev thi almost sepulchr parlor of which we have sought to
convei an idea is a pure local trait which is not reproduc with
the same sever in other convent at the convent of the rue du
templ in particular which belong in truth to anoth order the
black shutter were replac by brown curtain and the parlor itself
wa a salon with a polish wood floor whose window were drape in
white muslin curtain and whose wall admit all sort of frame a
portrait of a benedictin nun with unveil face paint bouquet and
even the head of a turk
it is in that garden of the templ convent that stood that famou
chestnuttre which wa renown as the finest and the largest in
franc and which bore the reput among the good peopl of the
eighteenth centuri of be the father of all the chestnut tree of
the realm
as we have said thi convent of the templ wa occupi by
benedictin of the perpetu ador benedictin quit differ
from those who depend on cteaux thi order of the perpetu
ador is not veri ancient and doe not go back more than two
hundr year in 1649 the holi sacrament wa profan on two occas
a few dai apart in two church in pari at saintsulpic and at
saintjean en grve a rare and fright sacrileg which set the whole
town in an uproar m the prior and vicargener of saintgermain de
pr order a solemn process of all hi clergi in which the pope
nuncio offici but thi expiat did not satisfi two saint
women madam courtin marquis de bouc and the comtess de
chteauvieux thi outrag commit on the most holi sacrament of the
altar though but temporari would not depart from these holi soul
and it seem to them that it could onli be extenu by a perpetu
ador in some femal monasteri both of them on in 1652 the
other in 1653 made donat of notabl sum to mother catherin de
bar call of the holi sacrament a benedictin nun for the purpos
of found to thi piou end a monasteri of the order of
saintbenot the first permiss for thi foundat wa given to
mother catherin de bar by m de metz abb of saintgermain on
condit that no woman could be receiv unless she contribut three
hundr livr incom which amount to six thousand livr to the
princip after the abb of saintgermain the king accord
letterspat and all the rest abbati charter and royal letter
wa confirm in 1654 by the chamber of account and the parliament
such is the origin of the legal consecr of the establish of
the benedictin of the perpetu ador of the holi sacrament at
pari their first convent wa a new build in the rue cassett
out of the contribut of mesdam de bouc and de chteauvieux
thi order as it will be seen wa not to be confound with the
benedictin nun of cteaux it mount back to the abb of
saintgermain de pr in the same manner that the ladi of the
sacr heart go back to the gener of the jesuit and the sister of
chariti to the gener of the lazarist
it wa also total differ from the bernardin of the petitpicpu
whose interior we have just shown in 1657 pope alexand vii had
author by a special brief the bernardin of the rue
petitpicpu to practis the perpetu ador like the benedictin
nun of the holi sacrament but the two order remain distinct
nonetheless
chapter xiend of the petitpicpu
at the begin of the restor the convent of the petitpicpu
wa in it decai thi form a part of the gener death of the order
which after the eighteenth centuri ha been disappear like all the
religi order contempl is like prayer on of human
need but like everyth which the revolut touch it will be
transform and from be hostil to social progress it will becom
favor to it
the hous of the petitpicpu wa becom rapidli depopul in
1840 the littl convent had disappear the school had disappear
there were no longer ani old women nor young girl the first were
dead the latter had taken their departur volaverunt
the rule of the perpetu ador is so rigid in it natur that it
alarm vocat recoil befor it the order receiv no recruit in
1845 it still obtain laysist here and there but of profess
nun none at all forti year ago the nun number nearli a hundr
fifteen year ago there were not more than twentyeight of them how
mani ar there todai in 1847 the prioress wa young a sign that the
circl of choic wa restrict she wa not forti year old in
proport as the number diminish the fatigu increas the servic
of each becom more pain the moment could then be seen draw
near when there would be but a dozen bent and ach shoulder to bear
the heavi rule of saintbenot the burden is implac and remain
the same for the few as for the mani it weigh down it crush thu
thei die at the period when the author of thi book still live in
pari two di on wa twentyf year old the other twentythre
thi latter can sai like julia alpinula hic jaceo vixi anno
viginti et tre it is in consequ of thi decai that the convent
gave up the educ of girl
we have not felt abl to pass befor thi extraordinari hous without
enter it and without introduc the mind which accompani us and
which ar listen to our tale to the profit of some perchanc of
the melancholi histori of jean valjean we have penetr into thi
commun full of those old practic which seem so novel todai it
is the close garden hortu conclusu we have spoken of thi
singular place in detail but with respect in so far at least as
detail and respect ar compat we do not understand all but we
insult noth we ar equal far remov from the hosanna of joseph
de maistr who wound up by anoint the execution and from the
sneer of voltair who even goe so far as to ridicul the cross
an illog act on voltair part we mai remark by the wai for
voltair would have defend jesu as he defend cala and even for
those who deni superhuman incarn what doe the crucifix
repres the assassin sage
in thi nineteenth centuri the religi idea is undergo a crisi
peopl ar unlearn certain thing and thei do well provid that
while unlearn them thei learn thi there is no vacuum in the human
heart certain demolit take place and it is well that thei do but
on condit that thei ar follow by reconstruct
in the meantim let us studi thing which ar no more it is necessari
to know them if onli for the purpos of avoid them the
counterfeit of the past assum fals name and gladli call themselv

passport let us inform ourselv of the trap let us be on our guard
the past ha a visag superstit and a mask hypocrisi let us
denounc the visag and let us tear off the mask

with regard to the mode of prayer all ar good provid that thei

behold god on fanci he hear a mole cry i piti them with

we blame the church when she is satur with intrigu we despis
the spiritu which is harsh toward the tempor but we everywher
honor the thought man
we salut the man who kneel

the law of the sage and it is the law of the ascet in thi respect
the ascet and the sage converg there is a materi growth we admit
it there is a moral grandeur we hold to that thoughtless and
vivaci spirit sai
what is the good of those motionless figur on the side of mysteri
what purpos do thei serv what do thei do
ala in the presenc of the dark which environ us and which
await us in our ignor of what the immens dispers will make of
us we repli there is probabl no work more divin than that
perform by these soul and we add there is probabl no work which

there certainli must be some who prai constantli for those who never

in our opinion the whole question li in the amount of thought that is
mingl with prayer

the femal convent in particularfor in our centuri it is woman who
suffer the most and in thi exil of the cloister there is someth
of protestationth femal convent ha incontest a certain
majesti
thi cloister exist which is so auster so depress a few of
whose featur we have just trace is not life for it is not liberti
it is not the tomb for it is not plenitud it is the strang place

the abyss where we ar on the other the abyss whither we shall go it
is the narrow and misti frontier separ two world illumin and
obscur by both at the same time where the rai of life which ha
becom enfeebl is mingl with the vagu rai of death it is the half
obscur of the tomb
we who do not believ what these women believ but who like them
live by faithw have never been abl to think without a sort of

toward the gulf and the unknown their ey fix motionless on the
dark kneel bewild stupefi shudder half lift at
time by the deep breath of etern
book eighthcemeteri take that which is commit them
chapter iwhich treat of the manner of enter a convent
it wa into thi hous that jean valjean had as fauchelev express
it fallen from the sky
he had scale the wall of the garden which form the angl of the rue
polonceau that hymn of the angel which he had heard in the middl of
the night wa the nun chant matin that hall of which he had
caught a glimps in the gloom wa the chapel that phantom which he
had seen stretch on the ground wa the sister who wa make
repar that bell the sound of which had so strang surpris
him wa the garden bell attach to the knee of father
fauchelev
cosett onc put to bed jean valjean and fauchelev had as we have
alreadi seen sup on a glass of wine and a bit of chees befor a
good crackl fire then the onli bed in the hut be occupi by
cosett each threw himself on a truss of straw
befor he shut hi ey jean valjean said i must remain here
henceforth thi remark trot through fauchelev head all night
long
to tell the truth neither of them slept
jean valjean feel that he wa discov and that javert wa on hi
scent understood that he and cosett were lost if thei return to
pari then the new storm which had just burst upon him had strand
him in thi cloister jean valjean had henceforth but on thoughtto
remain there now for an unfortun man in hi posit thi convent
wa both the safest and the most danger of place the most
danger becaus as no men might enter there if he were discov
it wa a flagrant offenc and jean valjean would find but on step
interven between the convent and prison the safest becaus if he
could manag to get himself accept there and remain there who would
ever seek him in such a place to dwell in an imposs place wa
safeti
on hi side fauchelev wa cudgel hi brain he began by
declar to himself that he understood noth of the matter how had
m madelein got there when the wall were what thei were cloister
wall ar not to be step over how did he get there with a child
on cannot scale a perpendicular wall with a child in on arm who
wa that child where did thei both come from sinc fauchelev had
live in the convent he had heard noth of m sur m and he knew
noth of what had taken place there father madelein had an air
which discourag question and besid fauchelev said to himself
on doe not question a saint m madelein had preserv all hi
prestig in fauchelev ey onli from some word which jean
valjean had let fall the garden thought he could draw the infer
that m madelein had probabl becom bankrupt through the hard time
and that he wa pursu by hi creditor or that he had compromis
himself in some polit affair and wa in hide which last did not
displeas fauchelev who like mani of our peasant of the north
had an old fund of bonapart about him while in hide m madelein
had select the convent as a refug and it wa quit simpl that he
should wish to remain there but the inexplic point to which
fauchelev return constantli and over which he weari hi brain
wa that m madelein should be there and that he should have that
littl girl with him fauchelev saw them touch them spoke to
them and still did not believ it possibl the incomprehens had
just made it entranc into fauchelev hut fauchelev grope
about amid conjectur and could see noth clearli but thi m
madelein save my life thi certainti alon wa suffici and
decid hi cours he said to himself it is my turn now he ad
in hi conscienc m madelein did not stop to deliber when it wa
a question of thrust himself under the cart for the purpos of
drag me out he made up hi mind to save m madelein
nevertheless he put mani question to himself and made himself diver
repli after what he did for me would i save him if he were a
thief just the same if he were an assassin would i save him just
the same sinc he is a saint shall i save him just the same
but what a problem it wa to manag to have him remain in the convent
fauchelev did not recoil in the face of thi almost chimer
undertak thi poor peasant of picardi without ani other ladder than
hi selfdevot hi good will and a littl of that old rustic
cun on thi occas enlist in the servic of a gener
enterpris undertook to scale the difficulti of the cloister and
the steep escarp of the rule of saintbenot father fauchelev
wa an old man who had been an egoist all hi life and who toward
the end of hi dai halt infirm with no interest left to him in the
world found it sweet to be grate and perceiv a gener action
to be perform flung himself upon it like a man who at the moment
when he is dy should find close to hi hand a glass of good wine
which he had never tast and should swallow it with avid we mai
add that the air which he had breath for mani year in thi convent
had destroi all person in him and had end by render a good
action of some kind absolut necessari to him
so he took hi resolv to devot himself to m madelein
we have just call him a poor peasant of picardi that descript
is just but incomplet at the point of thi stori which we have now
reach a littl of father fauchelev physiolog becom us
he wa a peasant but he had been a notari which ad trickeri to hi
cun and penetr to hi ingenu have through variou
caus fail in hi busi he had descend to the call of a
carter and a labor but in spite of oath and lash which hors
seem to requir someth of the notari had linger in him he had
some natur wit he talk good grammar he convers which is a rare
thing in a villag and the other peasant said of him he talk
almost like a gentleman with a hat fauchelev belong in fact to
that speci which the impertin and flippant vocabulari of the last
centuri qualifi as demibourgeoi demilout and which the
metaphor shower by the chteau upon the thatch cottag ticket in
the pigeonhol of the plebeian rather rustic rather citifi
pepper and salt fauchelev though sore tri and harshli us by
fate worn out a sort of poor threadbar old soul wa nevertheless
an impuls man and extrem spontan in hi action a preciou
qualiti which prevent on from ever be wick hi defect and hi
vice for he had some were all superfici in short hi physiognomi
wa of the kind which succe with an observ hi ag face had none
of those disagre wrinkl at the top of the forehead which
signifi malic or stupid
at daybreak father fauchelev open hi ey after have done an
enorm deal of think and beheld m madelein seat on hi truss
of straw and watch cosett slumber fauchelev sat up and
said
now that you ar here how ar you go to contriv to enter
thi remark sum up the situat and arous jean valjean from hi
reveri
the two men took counsel togeth
in the first place said fauchelev you will begin by not set
foot outsid of thi chamber either you or the child on step in the
garden and we ar done for
that is true
monsieur madelein resum fauchelev you have arriv at a veri
auspici moment i mean to sai a veri inauspici moment on of the

wall it is hidden by a sort of ruin there ar tree it is not
visibl from the convent
and i add that the nun never come near it

the interrog mark which accentu thi well signifi it

churchyou see thei plai at recreat hour it suffic to have a
ball roll asid to send them all hither in spite of prohibit to

fauchelev recoil and crack hi fingerjoint
but that is imposs
bah imposs to take a hammer and drive some nail in a plank
what seem unpreced to fauchelev wa we repeat a simpl
matter to jean valjean jean valjean had been in wors strait than
thi ani man who ha been a prison understand how to contract
himself to fit the diamet of the escap the prison is subject to
flight as the sick man is subject to a crisi which save or kill him
an escap is a cure what doe not a man undergo for the sake of a
cure to have himself nail up in a case and carri off like a bale
of good to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is
none to econom hi breath for hour to know how to stifl without
dyingthi wa on of jean valjean gloomi talent
moreov a coffin contain a live beingthat convict
expedienti also an imperi expedi if we ar to credit the monk
austin castillejo thi wa the mean emploi by charl the fifth
desir of see the plomb for the last time after hi abdic
he had her brought into and carri out of the monasteri of saintyust
in thi manner
fauchelev who had recov himself a littl exclaim
but how will you manag to breath
i will breath
in that box the mere thought of it suffoc me
you sure must have a gimlet you will make a few hole here and
there around my mouth and you will nail the top plank on loos
good and what if you should happen to cough or to sneez
a man who is make hi escap doe not cough or sneez
and jean valjean ad
father fauchelev we must come to a decis i must either be
caught here or accept thi escap through the hears
everi on ha notic the tast which cat have for paus and
loung between the two leav of a halfshut door who is there who
ha not said to a cat do come in there ar men who when an
incid stand halfopen befor them have the same tendenc to halt
in indecis between two resolut at the risk of get crush
through the abrupt close of the adventur by fate the overprud
cat as thei ar and becaus thei ar cat sometim incur more
danger than the audaci fauchelev wa of thi hesit natur
but jean valjean cool prevail over him in spite of himself he
grumbl
well sinc there is no other mean
jean valjean resum
the onli thing which troubl me is what will take place at the
cemeteri
that is the veri point that is not troublesom exclaim
fauchelev if you ar sure of come out of the coffin all right i
am sure of get you out of the grave the gravedigg is a
drunkard and a friend of mine he is father mestienn an old fellow
of the old school the gravedigg put the corps in the grave and
i put the gravedigg in my pocket i will tell you what will take
place thei will arriv a littl befor dusk threequart of an hour
befor the gate of the cemeteri ar close the hears will drive
directli up to the grave i shall follow that is my busi i shall
have a hammer a chisel and some pincer in my pocket the hears
halt the undertak men knot a rope around your coffin and lower
you down the priest sai the prayer make the sign of the cross
sprinkl the holi water and take hi departur i am left alon with
father mestienn he is my friend i tell you on of two thing will
happen he will either be sober or he will not be sober if he is not
drunk i shall sai to him come and drink a bout while the bon co
the good quinc is open i carri him off i get him drunkit doe
not take long to make father mestienn drunk he alwai ha the
begin of it about himi lai him under the tabl i take hi card
so that i can get into the cemeteri again and i return without him
then you have no longer ani on but me to deal with if he is drunk i
shall sai to him be off i will do your work for you off he goe
and i drag you out of the hole
jean valjean held out hi hand and fauchelev precipit himself
upon it with the touch effus of a peasant
that is settl father fauchelev all will go well
provid noth goe wrong thought fauchelev in that case it
would be terribl
chapter vit is not necessari to be drunk in order to be immort
on the follow dai as the sun wa declin the veri rare
passersbi on the boulevard du main pull off their hat to an
oldfashion hears ornament with skull crossbon and tear
thi hears contain a coffin cover with a white cloth over which

mourningcoach in which could be seen a priest in hi surplic and a
choir boi in hi red cap follow two undertak men in grai
uniform trim with black walk on the right and the left of the

the inter of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the
exit of cosett the introduct of jean valjean to the deadroomal
had been execut without difficulti and there had been no hitch
let us remark in pass that the burial of mother crucifixion under
the altar of the convent is a perfectli venial offenc in our sight it

not onli without difficulti but even with the applaus of their own

he like fauchelev count on father mestienn he had no doubt as
to the end never wa there a more critic situat never more
complet composur
the four plank of the coffin breath out a kind of terribl peac it
seem as though someth of the repos of the dead enter into jean
valjean tranquil
from the depth of that coffin he had been abl to follow and he had
follow all the phase of the terribl drama which he wa plai
with death
shortli after fauchelev had finish nail on the upper plank
jean valjean had felt himself carri out then driven off he knew
from the diminut in the jolt when thei left the pavement and
reach the earth road he had divin from a dull nois that thei
were cross the bridg of austerlitz at the first halt he had
understood that thei were enter the cemeteri at the second halt he
said to himself
here is the grave
suddenli he felt hand seiz the coffin then a harsh grate against
the plank he explain it to himself as the rope which wa be
fasten round the casket in order to lower it into the caviti
then he experienc a giddi
the undertak man and the gravedigg had probabl allow the
coffin to lose it balanc and had lower the head befor the foot
he recov himself fulli when he felt himself horizont and
motionless he had just touch the bottom
he had a certain sensat of cold
a voic rose abov him glacial and solemn he heard latin word which
he did not understand pass over him so slowli that he wa abl to
catch them on by on
qui dormiunt in terr pulver evigilabunt alii in vitam ternam et
alii in approbrium ut videant semper
a child voic said
de profundi
the grave voic began again
requiem ternam dona ei domin
the child voic respond
et lux perpetua luceat ei
he heard someth like the gentl patter of sever drop of rain on
the plank which cover him it wa probabl the holi water
he thought thi will be over soon now patienc for a littl while
longer the priest will take hi departur fauchelev will take
mestienn off to drink i shall be left then fauchelev will return
alon and i shall get out that will be the work of a good hour
the grave voic resum
requiescat in pace
and the child voic said
amen
jean valjean strain hi ear and heard someth like retreat
footstep
there thei ar go now thought he i am alon
all at onc he heard over hi head a sound which seem to him to be a
clap of thunder
it wa a shovel of earth fall on the coffin
a second shovel fell
on of the hole through which he breath had just been stop up
a third shovel of earth fell
then a fourth
there ar thing which ar too strong for the strongest man jean
valjean lost conscious

valjean
when the hears had driven off when the priest and the choir boi had
enter the carriag again and taken their departur fauchelev who
had not taken hi ey from the gravedigg saw the latter bend over

thei were fauchelev jean valjean and cosett
the two old men had gone to fetch cosett from the fruiter in the
rue du cheminvert where fauchelev had deposit her on the
preced dai cosett had pass these twentyfour hour trembl
silent and understand noth she trembl to such a degre that
she wept she had neither eaten nor slept the worthi fruitsel had
pli her with a hundr question without obtain ani other repli
than a melancholi and unvari gaze cosett had betrai noth of
what she had seen and heard dure the last two dai she divin that
thei were pass through a crisi she wa deepli consciou that it
wa necessari to be good who ha not experienc the sovereign power
of those two word pronounc with a certain accent in the ear of a
terrifi littl be sai noth fear is mute moreov no on
guard a secret like a child
but when at the expir of these lugubri twentyfour hour she
beheld jean valjean again she gave vent to such a cry of joi that ani
thought person who had chanc to hear that cry would have guess
that it issu from an abyss
fauchelev belong to the convent and knew the password all the
door open
thu wa solv the doubl and alarm problem of how to get out and
how to get in
the porter who had receiv hi instruct open the littl
servant door which connect the courtyard with the garden and which
could still be seen from the street twenti year ago in the wall at
the bottom of the court which face the carriag entranc
the porter admit all three of them through thi door and from that
point thei reach the inner reserv parlor where fauchelev on
the preced dai had receiv hi order from the prioress
the prioress rosari in hand wa wait for them a vocal mother
with her veil lower stood besid her
a discreet candl light on might almost sai made a show of

the vocal mother said to the prioress in a low voic
he answer well
jean valjean had not utter a singl word
the prioress look attent at cosett and said half aloud to the
vocal mother
she will grow up ugli
the two mother consult for a few moment in veri low tone in the

in the first men ar bound onli with chain in the other chain by
faith
what flow from the first an immens curs the gnash of teeth
hatr desper vicious a cry of rage against human societi a
sarcasm against heaven
what result flow from the second bless and love
and in these two place so similar yet so unlik these two speci of
be who were so veri unlik were undergo the same work
expiat
jean valjean understood thoroughli the expiat of the former that
person expiat the expiat for on self but he did not
understand that of these last that of creatur without reproach and
without stain and he trembl as he ask himself the expiat of
what what expiat
a voic within hi conscienc repli the most divin of human
generos the expiat for other
here all person theori is withheld we ar onli the narrat we
place ourselv at jean valjean point of view and we translat hi
impress
befor hi ey he had the sublim summit of abneg the highest
possibl pitch of virtu the innoc which pardon men their fault
and which expiat in their stead servitud submit to tortur
accept punish claim by soul which have not sin for the
sake of spare it to soul which have fallen the love of human
swallow up in the love of god but even there preserv it distinct
and mediatori charact sweet and feebl be possess the
miseri of those who ar punish and the smile of those who ar
recompens
and he rememb that he had dare to murmur
often in the middl of the night he rose to listen to the grate
song of those innoc creatur weigh down with sever and the
blood ran cold in hi vein at the thought that those who were justli
chastis rais their voic heavenward onli in blasphemi and that
he wretch that he wa had shaken hi fist at god
there wa on strike thing which caus him to medit deepli like
a warn whisper from provid itself the scale of that wall the
pass of those barrier the adventur accept even at the risk of
death the pain and difficult ascent all those effort even which
he had made to escap from that other place of expiat he had made
in order to gain entranc into thi on wa thi a symbol of hi
destini thi hous wa a prison likewis and bore a melancholi
resembl to that other on whenc he had fled and yet he had never
conceiv an idea of anyth similar
again he beheld grate bolt iron barsto guard whom angel
these lofti wall which he had seen around tiger he now beheld onc
more around lamb
thi wa a place of expiat and not of punish and yet it wa
still more auster more gloomi and more pitiless than the other
these virgin were even more heavili burden than the convict a
cold harsh wind that wind which had chill hi youth travers the
bar and padlock grate of the vultur a still harsher and more
bite breez blew in the cage of these dove
why
when he thought on these thing all that wa within him wa lost in
amaz befor thi mysteri of sublim
in these medit hi pride vanish he scrutin hi own heart
in all manner of wai he felt hi petti and mani a time he wept
all that had enter into hi life for the last six month had led him
back toward the bishop holi injunct cosett through love the
convent through humil
sometim at eventid in the twilight at an hour when the garden wa
desert he could be seen on hi knee in the middl of the walk which
skirt the chapel in front of the window through which he had gaze
on the night of hi arriv and turn toward the spot where as he
knew the sister wa make repar prostrat in prayer thu he
prai as he knelt befor the sister
it seem as though he dare not kneel directli befor god
everyth that surround him that peac garden those fragrant

simpl women that silent cloister slowli permeat him and littl by
littl hi soul becam compound of silenc like the cloister of

which had receiv him in success at two critic moment in hi
life the first when all door were close and when human societi
reject him the second at a moment when human societi had again set
out in pursuit of him and when the gallei were again yawn and
that had it not been for the first he should have relaps into

mariu might have set out that veri even and have been with hi
father on the follow morn a dilig from the rue du bouloi
took the trip to rouen by night at that date and pass through
vernon neither mariu nor m gillenormand thought of make inquiri
about it
the next dai at twilight mariu reach vernon peopl were just

restor and like it did not recogn hi father claim to the
titl of either colonel or baron

then he perceiv that she wa weep

kneel and on ly at full length on the floor in hi shirt the

by the dim light of the candl a larg tear could be distinguish on
the pale and prostrat colonel cheek where it had trickl from hi

tear wa hi son delai
mariu gaze upon that man whom he beheld for the first time on that
vener and manli face on those open ey which saw not on those
white lock those robust limb on which here and there brown line
mark swordthrust and a sort of red star which indic
bullethol were visibl he contempl that gigant sear which
stamp heroism on that counten upon which god had imprint
good he reflect that thi man wa hi father and that thi man
wa dead and a chill ran over him
the sorrow which he felt wa the sorrow which he would have felt in the
presenc of ani other man whom he had chanc to behold stretch out
in death
anguish poignant anguish wa in that chamber the servantwoman wa
lament in a corner the cur wa prai and hi sob were audibl
the doctor wa wipe hi ey the corps itself wa weep
the doctor the priest and the woman gaze at mariu in the midst of
their afflict without utter a word he wa the stranger there
mariu who wa far too littl affect felt asham and embarrass
at hi own attitud he held hi hat in hi hand and he drop it on
the floor in order to produc the impress that grief had depriv
him of the strength to hold it
at the same time he experienc remors and he despis himself for
behav in thi manner but wa it hi fault he did not love hi
father why should he

not know where to stop mon dieu a man is not a monster becaus he wa
at waterloo a father is not separ from hi child for such a reason
as that he wa on of bonapart colonel he is dead i believ he

the old warden clasp hi hand and exclaim
ah you ar the child ye that true he must be a man by thi
time well poor child you mai sai that you had a father who love you

and he said to hi daughter in a low tone and with a wink some love
affair
chapter vith consequ of have met a warden
where it wa that mariu went will be disclos a littl further on
mariu wa absent for three dai then he return to pari went
straight to the librari of the lawschool and ask for the file of
the moniteur
he read the moniteur he read all the histori of the republ and
the empir the memori de saintehln all the memoir all the
newspap the bulletin the proclam he devour everyth
the first time that he came across hi father name in the bulletin
of the grand armi he had a fever for a week he went to see the
gener under whom georg pontmerci had serv among other comt
h churchwarden mabeuf whom he went to see again told him about the
life at vernon the colonel retreat hi flower hi solitud
mariu came to a full knowledg of that rare sweet and sublim man
that speci of lionlamb who had been hi father
in the meanwhil occupi as he wa with thi studi which absorb all
hi moment as well as hi thought he hardli saw the gillenormand at
all he made hi appear at meal then thei search for him and
he wa not to be found father gillenormand smile bah bah he is
just of the ag for the girl sometim the old man ad the
deuc i thought it wa onli an affair of gallantri it seem that it
is an affair of passion
it wa a passion in fact mariu wa on the high road to ador hi
father
at the same time hi idea underw an extraordinari chang the
phase of thi chang were numer and success as thi is the
histori of mani mind of our dai we think it will prove us to
follow these phase step by step and to indic them all
that histori upon which he had just cast hi ey appal him
the first effect wa to dazzl him
up to that time the republ the empir had been to him onli
monstrou word the republ a guillotin in the twilight the
empir a sword in the night he had just taken a look at it and where
he had expect to find onli a chao of shadow he had beheld with a
sort of unpreced surpris mingl with fear and joi star
sparkl mirabeau vergniaud saintjust robespierr camil
desmoulin danton and a sun aris napoleon he did not know where he
stood he recoil blind by the brilliant light littl by littl
when hi astonish had pass off he grew accustom to thi
radianc he contempl these deed without dizzi he examin
these personag without terror the revolut and the empir
present themselv lumin in perspect befor hi mind ey
he beheld each of these group of event and of men sum up in two
tremend fact the republ in the sovereignti of civil right
restor to the mass the empir in the sovereignti of the french
idea impos on europ he beheld the grand figur of the peopl emerg
from the revolut and the grand figur of franc spring forth from
the empir he assert in hi conscienc that all thi had been good
what hi dazzl state neglect in thi hi first far too synthet
estim we do not think it necessari to point out here it is the
state of a mind on the march that we ar record progress is not
accomplish in on stage that state onc for all in connect
with what preced as well as with what is to follow we continu
he then perceiv that up to that moment he had comprehend hi
countri no more than he had comprehend hi father he had not known
either the on or the other and a sort of voluntari night had obscur
hi ey now he saw and on the on hand he admir while on the
other he ador
he wa fill with regret and remors and he reflect in despair that
all he had in hi soul could now be said onli to the tomb oh if hi
father had still been in exist if he had still had him if god in
hi compass and hi good had permit hi father to be still
among the live how he would have run how he would have precipit
himself how he would have cri to hi father father here i am it
is i i have the same heart as thou i am thy son how he would have
embrac that white head bath hi hair in tear gaze upon hi
scar press hi hand ador hi garment kiss hi feet oh why
had hi father di so earli befor hi time befor the justic the
love of hi son had come to him mariu had a continu sob in hi
heart which said to him everi moment ala at the same time he
becam more truli seriou more truli grave more sure of hi thought
and hi faith at each instant gleam of the true came to complet hi
reason an inward growth seem to be in progress within him he wa
consciou of a sort of natur enlarg which gave him two thing
that were new to himhi father and hi countri
as everyth open when on ha a kei so he explain to himself that
which he had hate he penetr that which he had abhor
henceforth he plainli perceiv the providenti divin and human
sens of the great thing which he had been taught to detest and of
the great men whom he had been instruct to curs when he reflect
on hi former opinion which were but those of yesterdai and which
nevertheless seem to him alreadi so veri ancient he grew indign
yet he smile
from the rehabilit of hi father he natur pass to the
rehabilit of napoleon
but the latter we will confess wa not effect without labor
from hi infanc he had been imbu with the judgment of the parti of
1814 on bonapart now all the prejudic of the restor all it
interest all it instinct tend to disfigur napoleon it execr
him even more than it did robespierr it had veri cleverli turn to
suffici good account the fatigu of the nation and the hatr of
mother bonapart had becom an almost fabul monster and in order
to paint him to the imagin of the peopl which as we late
point out resembl the imagin of children the parti of 1814
made him appear under all sort of terrifi mask in success from
that which is terribl though it remain grandios to that which is
terribl and becom grotesqu from tiberiu to the bugaboo thu in
speak of bonapart on wa free to sob or to puff up with laughter
provid that hatr lai at the bottom mariu had never
entertainedabout that man as he wa calledani other idea in hi
mind thei had combin with the tenac which exist in hi natur
there wa in him a headstrong littl man who hate napoleon
on read histori on studi him especi in the document and
materi for histori the veil which conceal napoleon from the ey
of mariu wa gradual rent he caught a glimps of someth immens
and he suspect that he had been deceiv up to that moment on the
score of bonapart as about all the rest each dai he saw more
distinctli and he set about mount slowli step by step almost
regretfulli in the begin then with intox and as though
attract by an irresist fascin first the sombr step then
the vagu illumin step at last the lumin and splendid step
of enthusiasm
on night he wa alon in hi littl chamber near the roof hi candl
wa burn he wa read with hi elbow rest on hi tabl close
to the open window all sort of reveri reach him from space and
mingl with hi thought what a spectacl is the night on hear
dull sound without know whenc thei proce on behold jupit
which is twelv hundr time larger than the earth glow like a
firebrand the azur is black the star shine it is formid
he wa perus the bulletin of the grand armi those heroic stroph
pen on the field of battl there at interv he beheld hi
father name alwai the name of the emperor the whole of that great
empir present itself to him he felt a flood swell and rise
within him it seem to him at moment that hi father pass close to
him like a breath and whisper in hi ear he gradual got into a
singular state he thought that he heard drum cannon trumpet the
measur tread of battalion the dull and distant gallop of the
cavalri from time to time hi ey were rais heavenward and gaze
upon the coloss constel as thei gleam in the measureless
depth of space then thei fell upon hi book onc more and there thei
beheld other coloss thing move confusedli hi heart contract
within him he wa in a transport trembl pant all at onc
without himself know what wa in him and what impuls he wa
obei he sprang to hi feet stretch both arm out of the window
gaze intent into the gloom the silenc the infinit dark the
etern immens and exclaim long live the emperor
from that moment forth all wa over the ogr of corsicath
usurperth tyrantth monster who wa the lover of hi own
sistersth actor who took lesson of talmath poison of
jaffath tigerbuonaparteal thi vanish and gave place in hi
mind to a vagu and brilliant radianc in which shone at an
inaccess height the pale marbl phantom of csar the emperor had
been for hi father onli the wellbelov captain whom on admir for
whom on sacrific on self he wa someth more to mariu he wa
the predestin constructor of the french group succeed the roman
group in the domin of the univers he wa a prodigi architect
of a destruct the continu of charlemagn of loui xi of henri
iv of richelieu of loui xiv and of the committe of public
safeti have hi spot no doubt hi fault hi crime even be
a man that is to sai but august in hi fault brilliant in hi
spot power in hi crime
he wa the predestin man who had forc all nation to sai the
great nation he wa better than that he wa the veri incarn of
franc conquer europ by the sword which he grasp and the world
by the light which he shed mariu saw in bonapart the dazzl
spectr which will alwai rise upon the frontier and which will guard
the futur despot but dictat a despot result from a republ and
sum up a revolut napoleon becam for him the manpeopl as
jesu christ is the mangod
it will be perceiv that like all new convert to a religion hi
convers intox him he hurl himself headlong into adhes
and he went too far hi natur wa so construct onc on the
downward slope it wa almost imposs for him to put on the drag
fanatic for the sword took possess of him and complic in hi
mind hi enthusiasm for the idea he did not perceiv that along with
geniu and pellmel he wa admit forc that is to sai that he
wa instal in two compart of hi idolatri on the on hand
that which is divin on the other that which is brutal in mani
respect he had set about deceiv himself otherwis he admit
everyth there is a wai of encount error while on on wai to
the truth he had a violent sort of good faith which took everyth in
the lump in the new path which he had enter on in judg the
mistak of the old regim as in measur the glori of napoleon he
neglect the attenu circumst
at all event a tremend step had been taken where he had formerli
beheld the fall of the monarchi he now saw the advent of franc hi
orient had chang what had been hi east becam the west he had
turn squar round
all these revolut were accomplish within him without hi famili
obtain an inkl of the case
when dure thi mysteri labor he had entir shed hi old
bourbon and ultra skin when he had cast off the aristocrat the
jacobit and the royalist when he had becom thoroughli a
revolutionist profoundli democrat and republican he went to an
engrav on the quai de orfvr and order a hundr card bear
thi name le baron mariu pontmerci
thi wa onli the strictli logic consequ of the chang which had
taken place in him a chang in which everyth gravit round hi
father
onli as he did not know ani on and could not sow hi card with ani
porter he put them in hi pocket
by anoth natur consequ in proport as he drew nearer to hi
father to the latter memori and to the thing for which the colonel
had fought five and twenti year befor he reced from hi
grandfath we have long ago said that m gillenormand temper did
not pleas him there alreadi exist between them all the disson
of the grave young man and the frivol old man the gayeti of gront
shock and exasper the melancholi of werther so long as the same
polit opinion and the same idea had been common to them both
mariu had met m gillenormand there as on a bridg when the bridg
fell an abyss wa form and then over and abov all mariu
experienc unutter impuls to revolt when he reflect that it
wa m gillenormand who had from stupid motiv torn him ruthlessli
from the colonel thu depriv the father of the child and the child
of the father
by dint of piti for hi father mariu had nearli arriv at avers
for hi grandfath
noth of thi sort howev wa betrai on the exterior as we have
alreadi said onli he grew colder and colder lacon at meal and
rare in the hous when hi aunt scold him for it he wa veri gentl
and alleg hi studi hi lectur the examin etc as a
pretext hi grandfath never depart from hi infal diagnosi
in love i know all about it
from time to time mariu absent himself
where is it that he goe off like thi said hi aunt
on on of these trip which were alwai veri brief he went to
montfermeil in order to obei the injunct which hi father had left
him and he sought the old sergeant to waterloo the innkeep
thnardier thnardier had fail the inn wa close and no on knew
what had becom of him mariu wa awai from the hous for four dai on
thi quest
he is get decidedli wild said hi grandfath
thei thought thei had notic that he wore someth on hi breast
under hi shirt which wa attach to hi neck by a black ribbon
chapter viisom petticoat
we have mention a lancer
he wa a greatgrandnephew of m gillenormand on the patern side
who led a garrison life outsid the famili and far from the domest
hearth lieuten thodul gillenormand fulfil all the condit

he is pretti deepli in love thought thodul
mariu direct hi step toward the church

wa disciplin in thi retreat death appear to him with larg
epaulet and he almost made the militari salut to him not know
what to write to hi aunt he decid not to write at all and it is
probabl that noth would have result from the discoveri made by
thodul as to the love affair of mariu if by on of those
mysteri arrang which ar so frequent in chanc the scene at

mariu return from vernon on the third dai in the middl of the

had heard hi entranc and had made hast to climb as quickli as hi
old leg permit the stair to the upper stori where mariu live
in order to embrac him and to question him while so do and to
find out where he had been

the entranc wa a triumphant on
m gillenormand held in on hand the greatcoat and in the other the
neckribbon and exclaim

colonel and mariu made it a matter of honor to pai it what he
thought when my father lai dy on the field of battl did
thnardier contriv to find him amid the smoke and the grapeshot and
bear him off on hi shoulder and yet he ow him noth and i who
ow so much to thnardier cannot join him in thi shadow where he is
ly in the pang of death and in my turn bring him back from death
to life oh i will find him to find thnardier in fact mariu
would have given on of hi arm to rescu him from hi miseri he
would have sacrif all hi blood to see thnardier to render
thnardier some servic to sai to him you do not know me well i do
know you here i am dispos of me thi wa mariu sweetest and most
magnific dream
chapter iiimariu grown up
at thi epoch mariu wa twenti year of ag it wa three year sinc
he had left hi grandfath both parti had remain on the same
term without attempt to approach each other and without seek
to see each other besid what wa the us of see each other
mariu wa the brass vase while father gillenormand wa the iron pot
we admit that mariu wa mistaken as to hi grandfath heart he had
imagin that m gillenormand had never love him and that that
crusti harsh and smile old fellow who curs shout and storm
and brandish hi cane cherish for him at the most onli that
affect which is at onc slight and sever of the dotard of
comedi mariu wa in error there ar father who do not love their
children there exist no grandfath who doe not ador hi grandson
at bottom as we have said m gillenormand idol mariu he
idol him after hi own fashion with an accompani of
snappish and box on the ear but thi child onc gone he felt a
black void in hi heart he would allow no on to mention the child to
him and all the while secretli regret that he wa so well obei
at first he hope that thi buonapartist thi jacobin thi
terrorist thi septembrist would return but the week pass by
year pass to m gillenormand great despair the blooddrink
did not make hi appear i could not do otherwis than turn him
out said the grandfath to himself and he ask himself if the
thing were to do over again would i do it hi pride instantli
answer ye but hi ag head which he shook in silenc repli
sadli no he had hi hour of depress he miss mariu old men
need affect as thei need the sun it is warmth strong as hi natur
wa the absenc of mariu had wrought some chang in him noth in
the world could have induc him to take a step toward that rogu
but he suffer he never inquir about him but he thought of him
incessantli he live in the marai in a more and more retir manner
he wa still merri and violent as of old but hi merriment had a
convuls harsh and hi violenc alwai termin in a sort of
gentl and gloomi deject he sometim said oh if he onli would
return what a good box on the ear i would give him
as for hi aunt she thought too littl to love much mariu wa no
longer for her much more than a vagu black form and she eventu
came to occupi herself with him much less than with the cat or the
paroquet which she probabl had what augment father gillenormand
secret suffer wa that he lock it all up within hi breast and
did not allow it exist to be divin hi sorrow wa like those
recent invent furnac which consum their own smoke it sometim
happen that offici busybodi spoke to him of mariu and ask
him what is your grandson do what ha becom of him the old
bourgeoi repli with a sigh that he wa a sad case and give a
fillip to hi cuff if he wish to appear gai monsieur le baron de
pontmerci is practis pettifog in some corner or other
while the old man regret mariu applaud himself as is the case
with all goodheart peopl misfortun had erad hi bitter
he onli thought of m gillenormand in an amiabl light but he had set
hi mind on not receiv anyth more from the man who had been
unkind to hi father thi wa the mitig translat of hi first
indign moreov he wa happi at have suffer and at
suffer still it wa for hi father sake the hard of hi life
satisfi and pleas him he said to himself with a sort of joi that
it wa certainli the least he could do that it wa an
expiationthat had it not been for that he would have been punish
in some other wai and later on for hi impiou indiffer toward hi
father and such a father that it would not have been just that hi
father should have all the suffer and he none of it and that in
ani case what were hi toil and hi destitut compar with the
colonel heroic life that in short the onli wai for him to approach
hi father and resembl him wa to be brave in the face of indig
as the other had been valiant befor the enemi and that that wa no
doubt what the colonel had meant to impli by the word he will be
worthi of it word which mariu continu to wear not on hi breast
sinc the colonel write had disappear but in hi heart
and then on the dai when hi grandfath had turn him out of door
he had been onli a child now he wa a man he felt it miseri we
repeat had been good for him poverti in youth when it succe ha
thi magnific properti about it that it turn the whole will
toward effort and the whole soul toward aspir poverti
instantli lai materi life bare and render it hideou henc
inexpress bound toward the ideal life the wealthi young man ha

occup for the baser side of the soul at the expens of the
loftier and more delic side the poor young man win hi bread with
difficulti he eat when he ha eaten he ha noth more but
medit he goe to the spectacl which god furnish grati he
gaze at the sky space the star flower children the human
among which he is suffer the creation amid which he beam he gaze
so much on human that he perceiv it soul he gaze upon creation
to such an extent that he behold god he dream he feel himself
great he dream on and feel himself tender from the egot of the
man who suffer he pass to the compass of the man who medit
an admir sentiment break forth in him forget of self and
piti for all as he think of the innumer enjoy which natur
offer give and lavish to soul which stand open and refus to
soul that ar close he come to piti he the millionnair of the
mind the millionnair of monei all hatr depart from hi heart in

himself afresh to the task of earn hi bread and while hi hand
earn hi bread hi dorsal column gain pride hi brain gather idea
hi task finish he return to ineff ecstasi to contempl
to joi he behold hi feet set in afflict in obstacl on the
pavement in the nettl sometim in the mire hi head in the light
he is firm seren gentl peac attent seriou content with
littl kindli and he thank god for have bestow on him those two
form of rich which mani a rich man lack work which make him
free and thought which make him dignifi
thi is what had happen with mariu to tell the truth he inclin a
littl too much to the side of contempl from the dai when he had
succeed in earn hi live with some approach to certainti he had
stop think it good to be poor and retrench time from hi
work to give to thought that is to sai he sometim pass entir
dai in medit absorb engulf like a visionari in the mute
voluptu of ecstasi and inward radianc he had thu propound
the problem of hi life to toil as littl as possibl at materi
labor in order to toil as much as possibl at the labor which is
impalp in other word to bestow a few hour on real life and to
cast the rest to the infinit as he believ that he lack noth
he did not perceiv that contempl thu understood end by
becom on of the form of idl that he wa content himself
with conquer the first necess of life and that he wa rest
from hi labor too soon
it wa evid that for thi energet and enthusiast natur thi
could onli be a transitori state and that at the first shock against
the inevit complic of destini mariu would awaken
in the meantim although he wa a lawyer and whatev father
gillenormand thought about the matter he wa not practis he wa
not even pettifog medit had turn him asid from plead
to haunt attornei to follow the court to hunt up caseswhat a bore
why should he do it he saw no reason for chang the manner of
gain hi livelihood the obscur and illpaid publish
establish had come to mean for him a sure sourc of work which did
not involv too much labor as we have explain and which suffic
for hi want
on of the publish for whom he work m magimel i think offer
to take him into hi own hous to lodg him well to furnish him with
regular occup and to give him fifteen hundr franc a year to
be well lodg fifteen hundr franc no doubt but renounc hi
liberti be on fix wage a sort of hire man of letter accord
to mariu opinion if he accept hi posit would becom both
better and wors at the same time he acquir comfort and lost hi
digniti it wa a fine and complet unhappi convert into a
repuls and ridicul state of tortur someth like the case of a
blind man who should recov the sight of on ey he refus
mariu dwelt in solitud ow to hi tast for remain outsid of

place within him to him he wa indebt for have known and love hi
father he oper on me for a cataract he said
the churchwarden had certainli plai a decis part
it wa not howev that m mabeuf had been anyth but the calm and
impass agent of provid in thi connect he had enlighten
mariu by chanc and without be awar of the fact as doe a candl
which some on bring he had been the candl and not the some on
as for mariu inward polit revolut m mabeuf wa total
incap of comprehend it of will or of direct it

chapter ivm mabeuf
on the dai when m mabeuf said to mariu certainli i approv of
polit opinion he express the real state of hi mind all
polit opinion were matter of indiffer to him and he approv
them all without distinct provid thei left him in peac as the

at that time but he wa neither a royalist a bonapartist a chartist
an orleanist nor an anarchist he wa a bouquinist a collector of
old book he did not understand how men could busi themselv with
hate each other becaus of silli stuff like the charter democraci
legitimaci monarchi the republ etc when there were in the world
all sort of moss grass and shrub which thei might be look
at and heap of folio and even of 32mo which thei might turn over
he took good care not to becom useless have book did not prevent
hi read be a botanist did not prevent hi be a garden
when he made pontmerci acquaint thi sympathi had exist
between the colonel and himselfthat what the colonel did for flower
he did for fruit m mabeuf had succeed in produc seedl pear

went to mass rather from gentl than from pieti and becaus as he
love the face of men but hate their nois he found them assembl

peopl rang hi bell in the rue msire two or three time a dai to
ask for it he drew as much as two thousand franc a year from it thi
constitut nearli the whole of hi fortun although poor he had had
the talent to form for himself by dint of patienc privat and
time a preciou collect of rare copi of everi sort he never went
out without a book under hi arm and he often return with two the

count over the linen in her chest and in spread out on her bed
the dress in the piec which she bought and never had made up she
knew how to read m mabeuf had nicknam her mother plutarqu
m mabeuf had taken a fanci to mariu becaus mariu be young and
gentl warm hi ag without startl hi timid youth combin
with gentl produc on old peopl the effect of the sun without
wind when mariu wa satur with militari glori with gunpowd
with march and countermarch and with all those prodigi battl
in which hi father had given and receiv such tremend blow of the
sword he went to see m mabeuf and m mabeuf talk to him of hi
hero from the point of view of flower
hi brother the cur di about 1830 and almost immedi as when
the night is draw on the whole horizon grew dark for m mabeuf a
notari failur depriv him of the sum of ten thousand franc which
wa all that he possess in hi brother right and hi own the
revolut of juli brought a crisi to publish in a period of
embarrass the first thing which doe not sell is a flora the
flora of the environ of cauteretz stop short week pass by
without a singl purchas sometim m mabeuf start at the sound of
the bell monsieur said mother plutarqu sadli it is the
watercarri in short on dai m mabeuf quit the rue msire
abdic the function of warden gave up saintsulpic sold not a
part of hi book but of hi printsthat to which he wa the least
attachedand instal himself in a littl hous on the rue
montparnass where howev he remain but on quarter for two
reason in the first place the ground floor and the garden cost three
hundr franc and he dare not spend more than two hundr franc on
hi rent in the second be near faton shootinggalleri he could
hear the pistolshot which wa intoler to him
he carri off hi flora hi copperpl hi herbarium hi
portfolio and hi book and establish himself near the
salptrir in a sort of thatch cottag of the villag of
austerlitz where for fifti crown a year he got three room and a
garden enclos by a hedg and contain a well he took advantag of
thi remov to sell off nearli all hi furnitur on the dai of hi
entranc into hi new quarter he wa veri gai and drove the nail on
which hi engrav and herbarium were to hang with hi own hand
dug in hi garden the rest of the dai and at night perceiv that
mother plutarqu had a melancholi air and wa veri thought he
tap her on the shoulder and said to her with a smile we have the
indigo
onli two visitor the booksel of the portesaintjacqu and
mariu were admit to view the thatch cottag at austerlitz a
brawl name which wa to tell the truth extrem disagre to
him
howev as we have just point out brain which ar absorb in some
bit of wisdom or folli or as it often happen in both at onc ar
but slowli access to the thing of actual life their own destini
is a faroff thing to them there result from such concentr a
passiv which if it were the outcom of reason would resembl
philosophi on declin descend trickl awai even crumbl awai
and yet is hardli consciou of it on self it alwai end it is
true in an awaken but the awaken is tardi in the meantim it
seem as though we held ourselv neutral in the game which is go on
between our happi and our unhappi we ar the stake and we
look on at the game with indiffer
it is thu that athwart the cloud which form about him when all hi
hope were extinguish on after the other m mabeuf remain rather
pueril but profoundli seren hi habit of mind had the regular
swing of a pendulum onc mount on an illus he went for a veri
long time even after the illus had disappear a clock doe not
stop short at the precis moment when the kei is lost
m mabeuf had hi innoc pleasur these pleasur were inexpens
and unexpect the merest chanc furnish them on dai mother
plutarqu wa read a romanc in on corner of the room she wa
read aloud find that she understood better thu to read aloud
is to assur on self of what on is read there ar peopl who
read veri loud and who have the appear of give themselv their
word of honor as to what thei ar perus
it wa with thi sort of energi that mother plutarqu wa read the
romanc which she had in hand m mabeuf heard her without listen to
her
in the cours of her read mother plutarqu came to thi phrase it
wa a question of an offic of dragoon and a beauti
the beauti pout and the dragoon
here she interrupt herself to wipe her glass
bouddha and the dragon struck in m mabeuf in a low voic ye it
is true that there wa a dragon which from the depth of it cave
spout flame through hi maw and set the heaven on fire mani star
had alreadi been consum by thi monster which besid had the
claw of a tiger bouddha went into it den and succeed in convert
the dragon that is a good book that you ar read mother plutarqu
there is no more beauti legend in exist
and m mabeuf fell into a delici reveri
chapter vpoverti a good neighbor for miseri
mariu like thi candid old man who saw himself gradual fall into
the clutch of indig and who came to feel astonish littl by
littl without howev be made melancholi by it mariu met
courfeyrac and sought out m mabeuf veri rare howev twice a
month at most
mariu pleasur consist in take long walk alon on the outer
boulevard or in the champsdemar or in the least frequent allei
of the luxembourg he often spent half a dai in gaze at a market
garden the bed of lettuc the chicken on the dungheap the hors
turn the waterwheel the passersbi stare at him in surpris and
some of them thought hi attir suspici and hi mien sinist he
wa onli a poor young man dream in an objectless wai
it wa dure on of hi stroll that he had hit upon the gorbeau
hous and tempt by it isol and it cheap had taken up
hi abod there he wa known there onli under the name of m mariu
some of hi father old gener or old comrad had invit him to go
and see them when thei learn about him mariu had not refus their
invit thei afford opportun of talk about hi father
thu he went from time to time to comt pajol to gener bellavesn
to gener fririon to the invalid there wa music and danc
there on such even mariu put on hi new coat but he never went
to these even parti or ball except on dai when it wa freez
cold becaus he could not afford a carriag and he did not wish to
arriv with boot otherwis than like mirror
he said sometim but without bitter men ar so made that in a
drawingroom you mai be soil everywher except on your shoe in
order to insur a good recept there onli on irreproach thing
is ask of you your conscienc no your boot
all passion except those of the heart ar dissip by reveri
mariu polit fever vanish thu the revolut of 1830 assist
in the process by satisfi and calm him he remain the same
set asid hi fit of wrath he still held the same opinion onli
thei had been temper to speak accur he had no longer ani
opinion he had sympathi to what parti did he belong to the parti
of human out of human he chose franc out of the nation he
chose the peopl out of the peopl he chose the woman it wa to that
point abov all that hi piti wa direct now he prefer an idea
to a deed a poet to a hero and he admir a book like job more than
an event like marengo and then when after a dai spent in medit
he return in the even through the boulevard and caught a glimps
through the branch of the tree of the fathomless space beyond the
nameless gleam the abyss the shadow the mysteri all that which is
onli human seem veri pretti inde to him
he thought that he had and he realli had in fact arriv at the
truth of life and of human philosophi and he had end by gaze at
noth but heaven the onli thing which truth can perceiv from the
bottom of her well
thi did not prevent him from multipli hi plan hi combin
hi scaffold hi project for the futur in thi state of
reveri an ey which could have cast a glanc into mariu interior
would have been dazzl with the puriti of that soul in fact had it
been given to our ey of the flesh to gaze into the conscienc of
other we should be abl to judg a man much more sure accord to
what he dream than accord to what he think there is will in
thought there is none in dream reveri which is utterli
spontan take and keep even in the gigant and the ideal the
form of our spirit noth proce more directli and more sincer
from the veri depth of our soul than our unpremedit and boundless
aspir toward the splendor of destini in these aspir
much more than in deliber ration coordin idea is the real
charact of a man to be found our chimra ar the thing which the
most resembl us each on of us dream of the unknown and the
imposs in accord with hi natur
toward the middl of thi year 1831 the old woman who wait on
mariu told him that hi neighbor the wretch jondrett famili had
been turn out of door mariu who pass nearli the whole of hi

hi whole counten hi profil all of whose line were round
without therebi lose their firm had a certain german
sweet which ha made it wai into the french physiognomi by wai of
alsac and lorrain and that complet absenc of angl which render
the sicambr so easili recogniz among the roman and which
distinguish the leonin from the aquilin race he wa at that period
of life when the mind of men who think is compos in nearli equal
part of depth and ingenu a grave situat be given he
had all that is requir to be stupid on more turn of the kei and he
might be sublim hi manner were reserv cold polish not veri
genial as hi mouth wa charm hi lip the reddest and hi teeth
the whitest in the world hi smile correct the sever of hi face
as a whole at certain moment that pure brow and that voluptu
smile present a singular contrast hi ey were small but hi
glanc wa larg
at the period of hi most abject miseri he had observ that young
girl turn round when he pass by and he fled or hid with death in
hi soul he thought that thei were stare at him becaus of hi old
cloth and that thei were laugh at them the fact is that thei
stare at him becaus of hi grace and that thei dream of him
thi mute misunderstand between him and the pretti passersbi had
made him shy he chose none of them for the excel reason that he
fled from all of them he live thu indefinitelystupidli as
courfeyrac said
courfeyrac also said to him do not aspir to be vener thei
call each other thou it is the tendenc of youth friendship to
slip into thi mode of address let me give you a piec of advic my

when courfeyrac had address to him some remark of thi natur mariu
avoid women both young and old more than ever for a week to come
and he avoid courfeyrac to boot
nevertheless there exist in all the immens of creation two women
whom mariu did not flee and to whom he paid no attent whatev in
truth he would have been veri much amaz if he had been inform that
thei were women on wa the beard old woman who swept out hi
chamber and caus courfeyrac to sai see that hi servant woman
wear hi beard mariu doe not wear hi own beard the other wa a
sort of littl girl whom he saw veri often and whom he never look
at
for more than a year mariu had notic in on of the walk of the
luxembourg the on which skirt the parapet of the ppinir a man
and a veri young girl who were almost alwai seat side by side on
the same bench at the most solitari end of the allei on the rue de
louest side everi time that that chanc which meddl with the
stroll of person whose gaze is turn inward led mariu to that
walkand it wa nearli everi dayh found thi coupl there the man
appear to be about sixti year of ag he seem sad and seriou hi
whole person present the robust and weari aspect peculiar to militari
men who have retir from the servic if he had worn a decor
mariu would have said he is an exoffic he had a kindli but
unapproach air and he never let hi glanc linger on the ey of
ani on he wore blue trouser a blue frock coat and a broadbrim
hat which alwai appear to be new a black cravat a quaker shirt
that is to sai it wa dazzlingli white but of coars linen a
grisett who pass near him on dai said here a veri tidi
widow hi hair wa veri white
the first time that the young girl who accompani him came and seat
herself on the bench which thei seem to have adopt she wa a sort
of child thirteen or fourteen year of ag so thin as to be almost
home awkward insignific and with a possibl promis of handsom
ey onli thei were alwai rais with a sort of displeas
assur her dress wa both ag and childish like the dress of the
scholar in a convent it consist of a badli cut gown of black
merino thei had the air of be father and daughter
mariu scan thi old man who wa not yet ag and thi littl
girl who wa not yet a person for a few dai and thereaft paid no
attent to them thei on their side did not appear even to see him
thei convers togeth with a peac and indiffer air the girl
chatter incessantli and merrili the old man talk but littl and
at time he fix on her ey overflow with an ineff patern
mariu had acquir the mechan habit of stroll in that walk he
invari found them there
thi is the wai thing went
mariu like to arriv by the end of the allei which wa furthest from
their bench he walk the whole length of the allei pass in front
of them then return to the extrem whenc he had come and began
again thi he did five or six time in the cours of hi promenad
and the promenad wa taken five or six time a week without it
have occur to him or to these peopl to exchang a greet that
personag and that young girl although thei appearedand perhap
becaus thei appearedto shun all glanc had natur caus some
attent on the part of the five or six student who stroll along
the ppinir from time to time the studiou after their lectur the
other after their game of billiard courfeyrac who wa among the
last had observ them sever time but find the girl home he
had speedili and carefulli kept out of the wai he had fled
discharg at them a sobriquet like a parthian dart impress sole
with the child gown and the old man hair he had dub the
daughter mademoisel lanoir and the father monsieur leblanc so
that as no on knew them under ani other titl thi nicknam becam a
law in the default of ani other name the student said ah monsieur
leblanc is on hi bench and mariu like the rest had found it
conveni to call thi unknown gentleman monsieur leblanc
we shall follow their exampl and we shall sai m leblanc in order to
facilit thi tale
so mariu saw them nearli everi dai at the same hour dure the first
year he found the man to hi tast but the girl insipid
chapter iilux facta est
dure the second year precis at the point in thi histori which
the reader ha now reach it chanc that thi habit of the
luxembourg wa interrupt without mariu himself be quit awar
why and nearli six month elaps dure which he did not set foot in
the allei on dai at last he return thither onc more it wa a
seren summer morn and mariu wa in joyou mood as on is when
the weather is fine it seem to him that he had in hi heart all the
song of the bird that he wa listen to and all the bit of blue
sky of which he caught glimps through the leav of the tree
he went straight to hi allei and when he reach the end of it he
perceiv still on the same bench that wellknown coupl onli when
he approach it certainli wa the same man but it seem to him that
it wa no longer the same girl the person whom he now beheld wa a
tall and beauti creatur possess of all the most charm line
of a woman at the precis moment when thei ar still combin with all
the most ingenu grace of the child a pure and fugit moment
which can be express onli by these two wordsfifteen year she
had wonder brown hair shade with thread of gold a brow that
seem made of marbl cheek that seem made of roseleaf a pale
flush an agit white an exquisit mouth whenc smile dart
like sunbeam and word like music a head such as raphael would have
given to mari set upon a neck that jean goujon would have attribut
to a venu and in order that noth might be lack to thi
bewitch face her nose wa not handsomeit wa pretti neither
straight nor curv neither italian nor greek it wa the parisian
nose that is to sai spiritu delic irregular purewhich
drive painter to despair and charm poet
when mariu pass near her he could not see her ey which were
constantli lower he saw onli her long chestnut lash permeat
with shadow and modesti
thi did not prevent the beauti child from smile as she listen
to what the whitehair old man wa sai to her and noth could
be more fascin than that fresh smile combin with those droop
ey
for a moment mariu thought that she wa anoth daughter of the same
man a sister of the former no doubt but when the invari habit of
hi stroll brought him for the second time near the bench and he had
examin her attent he recogn her as the same in six month
the littl girl had becom a young maiden that wa all noth is
more frequent than thi phenomenon there is a moment when girl
blossom out in the twinkl of an ey and becom rose all at onc
on left them children but yesterdai todai on find them disquiet
to the feel
thi child had not onli grown she had becom ideal as three dai

suffic to cloth her with beauti her april had arriv

that is the result of have pocket an incom a note fell due
yesterdai the young girl had receiv her quarterli incom
and then she wa no longer the schoolgirl with her felt hat her
merino gown her scholar shoe and red hand tast had come to her
with beauti she wa a welldress person clad with a sort of rich
and simpl eleg and without affect she wore a dress of black
damask a cape of the same materi and a bonnet of white crape her
white glove displai the delicaci of the hand which toi with the
carv chines ivori handl of a parasol and her silken shoe outlin
the small of her foot when on pass near her her whole toilett
exhal a youth and penetr perfum
as for the man he wa the same as usual
the second time that mariu approach her the young girl rais her
eyelid her ey were of a deep celesti blue but in that veil
azur there wa as yet noth but the glanc of a child she look
at mariu indiffer as she would have stare at the brat run
beneath the sycamor or the marbl vase which cast a shadow on the
bench and mariu on hi side continu hi promenad and thought
about someth els
he pass near the bench where the young girl sat five or six time
but without even turn hi ey in her direct
on the follow dai he return as wa hi wont to the luxembourg
as usual he found there the father and daughter but he paid no
further attent to them he thought no more about the girl now that
she wa beauti than he had when she wa home he pass veri near
the bench where she sat becaus such wa hi habit
chapter iiieffect of the spring
on dai the air wa warm the luxembourg wa inund with light and
shade the sky wa as pure as though the angel had wash it that
morn the sparrow were give vent to littl twitter in the depth
of the chestnuttre mariu had thrown open hi whole soul to natur
he wa not think of anyth he simpli live and breath he
pass near the bench the young girl rais her ey to him the two
glanc met
what wa there in the young girl glanc on thi occas mariu
could not have told there wa noth and there wa everyth it wa
a strang flash
she drop her ey and he pursu hi wai
what he had just seen wa no longer the ingenu and simpl ey of a
child it wa a mysteri gulf which had half open then abruptli
close again
there come a dai when the young girl glanc in thi manner woe to
him who chanc to be there
that first gaze of a soul which doe not as yet know itself is like
the dawn in the sky it is the awaken of someth radiant and
strang noth can give ani idea of the danger charm of that
unexpect gleam which flash suddenli and vagu forth from
ador shadow and which is compos of all the innoc of the
present and of all the passion of the futur it is a sort of
undecid tender which reveal itself by chanc and which wait
it is a snare which the innoc maiden set unknown to herself and in
which she captur heart without either wish or know it it is a
virgin look like a woman
it is rare that a profound reveri doe not spring from that glanc
where it fall all puriti and all candor meet in that celesti and
fatal gleam which more than all the bestplan tender glanc of
coquett possess the magic power of caus the sudden blossom
in the depth of the soul of that sombr flower impregn with
perfum and with poison which is call love
that even on hi return to hi garret mariu cast hi ey over
hi garment and perceiv for the first time that he had been so
slovenli indecor and inconceiv stupid as to go for hi walk in
the luxembourg with hi everydai cloth that is to sai with a hat
batter near the band coars carter boot black trouser which
show white at the knee and a black coat which wa pale at the
elbow
chapter ivbegin of a great maladi
on the follow dai at the accustom hour mariu drew from hi

boot he cloth himself in thi complet panopli put on hi glove
a tremend luxuri and set off for the luxembourg
on the wai thither he encount courfeyrac and pretend not to see
him courfeyrac on hi return home said to hi friend
i have just met mariu new hat and new coat with mariu insid them
he wa go to pass an examin no doubt he look utterli
stupid
on arriv at the luxembourg mariu made the tour of the fountain
basin and stare at the swan then he remain for a long time in
contempl befor a statu whose head wa perfectli black with
mould and on of whose hip wa miss near the basin there wa a
bourgeoi forti year of ag with a promin stomach who wa hold
by the hand a littl urchin of five and sai to him shun excess
my son keep at an equal distanc from despot and from anarchi
mariu listen to thi bourgeoi then he made the circuit of the
basin onc more at last he direct hi cours toward hi allei
slowli and as if with regret on would have said that he wa both
forc to go there and withheld from do so he did not perceiv it
himself and thought that he wa do as he alwai did
on turn into the walk he saw m leblanc and the young girl at the
other end on their bench he button hi coat up to the veri top
pull it down on hi bodi so that there might be no wrinkl
examin with a certain complais the lustrou gleam of hi
trouser and march on the bench thi march savor of an attack
and certainli of a desir for conquest so i sai that he march on the
bench as i should sai hannib march on rome
howev all hi movement were pure mechan and he had
interrupt none of the habitu preoccup of hi mind and labor
at that moment he wa think that the manuel du baccalaurat wa a
stupid book and that it must have been drawn up by rare idiot to
allow of three tragedi of racin and onli on comedi of molir be
analyz therein as masterpiec of the human mind there wa a
pierc whistl go on in hi ear as he approach the bench he
held fast to the fold in hi coat and fix hi ey on the young
girl it seem to him that she fill the entir extrem of the
allei with a vagu blue light
in proport as he drew near hi pace slacken more and more on
arriv at some littl distanc from the bench and long befor he had
reach the end of the walk he halt and could not explain to
himself why he retrac hi step he did not even sai to himself that
he would not go as far as the end it wa onli with difficulti that the
young girl could have perceiv him in the distanc and note hi fine
appear in hi new cloth nevertheless he held himself veri
erect in case ani on should be look at him from behind
he attain the opposit end then came back and thi time he
approach a littl nearer to the bench he even got to within three
interv of tree but there he felt an indescrib imposs of
proceed further and he hesit he thought he saw the young
girl face bend toward him but he exert a manli and violent
effort subdu hi hesit and walk straight ahead a few
second later he rush in front of the bench erect and firm
redden to the veri ear without dare to cast a glanc either to
the right or to the left with hi hand thrust into hi coat like a
statesman at the moment when he passedund the cannon of the
placeh felt hi heart beat wildli as on the preced dai she wore
her damask gown and her crape bonnet he heard an ineff voic
which must have been her voic she wa talk tranquilli she wa
veri pretti he felt it although he made no attempt to see her she
could not howev he thought help feel esteem and consider
for me if she onli knew that i am the verit author of the
dissert on marco obrgon de la rond which m franoi de
neufchteau put as though it were hi own at the head of hi edit
of gil bla he went beyond the bench as far as the extrem of the
walk which wa veri near then turn on hi heel and pass onc more
in front of the love girl thi time he wa veri pale moreov all
hi emot were disagre as he went further from the bench and
the young girl and while hi back wa turn to her he fanci that
she wa gaze after him and that made him stumbl
he did not attempt to approach the bench again he halt near the
middl of the walk and there a thing which he never did he sat down
and reflect in the most profoundli indistinct depth of hi spirit
that after all it wa hard that person whose white bonnet and black
gown he admir should be absolut insens to hi splendid
trouser and hi new coat
at the expir of a quarter of an hour he rose as though he were
on the point of again begin hi march toward that bench which wa
surround by an aureol but he remain stand there motionless
for the first time in fifteen month he said to himself that that
gentleman who sat there everi dai with hi daughter had on hi side
notic him and probabl consid hi assidu singular
for the first time also he wa consciou of some irrever in
design that stranger even in hi secret thought by the
sobriquet of m leblanc
he stood thu for sever minut with droop head trace figur
in the sand with the cane which he held in hi hand
then he turn abruptli in the direct opposit to the bench to m
leblanc and hi daughter and went home
that dai he forgot to dine at eight oclock in the even he
perceiv thi fact and as it wa too late to go down to the rue
saintjacqu he said never mind and at a bit of bread
he did not go to bed until he had brush hi coat and fold it up
with great care

further advanc than befor
in the first place not on of the signer gave hi address
then thei seem to come from four differ individu don alvar
mistress balizard the poet genflot and dramat artist fabant but
the singular thing about these letter wa that all four were written
by the same hand
what conclus wa to be drawn from thi except that thei all come
from the same person
moreov and thi render the conjectur all the more probabl the
coars and yellow paper wa the same in all four the odor of tobacco
wa the same and although an attempt had been made to vari the style
the same orthograph fault were reproduc with the greatest
tranquil and the man of letter genflot wa no more exempt from
them than the spanish captain
it wa wast of troubl to try to solv thi petti mysteri had it not
been a chanc find it would have born the air of a mystif
mariu wa too melancholi to take even a chanc pleasantri well and to
lend himself to a game which the pavement of the street seem desir
of plai with him it seem to him that he wa plai the part of
the blind man in blind man buff between the four letter and that
thei were make sport of him
noth howev indic that these letter belong to the two
young girl whom mariu had met on the boulevard after all thei were
evid paper of no valu mariu replac them in their envelop
flung the whole into a corner and went to bed about seven oclock in
the morn he had just risen and breakfast and wa try to
settl down to work when there came a soft knock at hi door
as he own noth he never lock hi door unless occasion
though veri rare when he wa engag in some press work even
when absent he left hi kei in the lock you will be rob said

what do you want maam bougon ask mariu without rais hi
ey from the book and manuscript on hi tabl
a voic which did not belong to maam bougon repli

man roughen with brandi and liquor
mariu turn round hastili and beheld a young girl
chapter iva rose in miseri
illustr rose in miseri
a veri young girl wa stand in the halfopen door the dormer window
of the garret through which the light fell wa precis opposit the
door and illumin the figur with a wan light she wa a frail
emaci slender creatur there wa noth but a chemis and a
petticoat upon that chill and shiver naked her girdl wa a
string her head ribbon a string her point shoulder emerg from
her chemis a blond and lymphat pallor earthcolor collarbon
red hand a halfopen and degrad mouth miss teeth dull bold
base ey she had the form of a young girl who ha miss her youth
and the look of a corrupt old woman fifti year mingl with fifteen
on of those be which ar both feebl and horribl and which caus
those to shudder whom thei do not caus to weep
mariu had risen and wa stare in a sort of stupor at thi be
who wa almost like the form of the shadow which travers dream
the most heartbreak thing of all wa that thi young girl had not
come into the world to be home in her earli childhood she must even
have been pretti the grace of her ag wa still struggl against the
hideou prematur decrepitud of debaucheri and poverti the remain
of beauti were dy awai in that face of sixteen like the pale
sunlight which is extinguish under hideou cloud at dawn on a
winter dai
that face wa not wholli unknown to mariu he thought he rememb
have seen it somewher
what do you wish mademoisel he ask
the young girl repli in her voic of a drunken convict

she call mariu by hi name he could not doubt that he wa the
person whom she want but who wa thi girl how did she know hi

heart bleed at the whole room and the unmad bed her feet were bare
larg hole in her petticoat permit glimps of her long leg and
her thin knee she wa shiver

mariu as he open the letter notic that the enorm wafer which
seal it wa still moist the messag could not have come from a

ps my eldest daughter will await your order dear monsieur mariu
thi letter come in the veri midst of the mysteri adventur which
had occupi mariu thought ever sinc the preced even wa
like a candl in a cellar all wa suddenli illumin
thi letter came from the same place as the other four there wa the
same write the same style the same orthographi the same paper the
same odor of tobacco
there were five missiv five histori five signatur and a singl
signer the spanish captain don alvar the unhappi mistress balizard
the dramat poet genflot the old comedian fabant were all four
name jondrett if inde jondrett himself were name jondrett
mariu had live in the hous for a toler long time and he had
had as we have said but veri rare occas to see to even catch a
glimps of hi extrem mean neighbor hi mind wa elsewher and
where the mind is there the ey ar also he had been oblig more
than onc to pass the jondrett in the corridor or on the stair but
thei were mere form to him he had paid so littl heed to them that
on the preced even he had jostl the jondrett girl on the
boulevard without recogn them for it had evid been thei
and it wa with great difficulti that the on who had just enter hi
room had awaken in him in spite of disgust and piti a vagu
recollect of have met her elsewher
now he saw everyth clearli he understood that hi neighbor
jondrett in hi distress exercis the industri of specul on
the chariti of benevol person that he procur address and that
he wrote under feign name to peopl whom he judg to be wealthi and
compassion letter which hi daughter deliv at their risk and
peril for thi father had come to such a pass that he risk hi
daughter he wa plai a game with fate and he us them as the
stake mariu understood that probabl judg from their flight on
the even befor from their breathless condit from their terror
and from the word of slang which he had overheard these unfortun
creatur were ply some inexplic sad profess and that the
result of the whole wa in the midst of human societi as it is now
constitut two miser be who were neither girl nor women a
speci of impur and innoc monster produc by miseri
sad creatur without name or sex or ag to whom neither good nor
evil were ani longer possibl and who on emerg from childhood

respons soul which blossom out yesterdai and ar fade
todai like those flower let fall in the street which ar soil
with everi sort of mire while wait for some wheel to crush them
nevertheless while mariu bent a pain and astonish gaze on her
the young girl wa wander back and forth in the garret with the
audac of a spectr she kick about without troubl herself as
to her naked occasion her chemis which wa unti and torn
fell almost to her waist she move the chair about she disarrang

lugubri
an indescrib constraint weari and humili were
percept beneath thi hardihood effronteri is a disgrac
noth could be more melancholi than to see her sport about the room
and so to speak flit with the movement of a bird which is frighten
by the daylight or which ha broken it wing on felt that under
other condit of educ and destini the gai and overfre mien
of thi young girl might have turn out sweet and charm never
even among anim doe the creatur born to be a dove chang into an
osprei that is onli to be seen among men
mariu reflect and allow her to have her wai

mariu had in fact seen jondrett pass along the rue mouffetard
and wa spy on hi proceed
jondrett walk straight ahead without a suspicion that he wa
alreadi held by a glanc
he quit the rue mouffetard and mariu saw him enter on of the most
terribl hovel in the rue gracieus he remain there about a quarter
of an hour then return to the rue mouffetard he halt at an
ironmong shop which then stood at the corner of the rue
pierrelombard and a few minut later mariu saw him emerg from the
shop hold in hi hand a huge cold chisel with a white wood handl
which he conceal beneath hi greatcoat at the top of the rue
petitgentilli he turn to the left and proceed rapidli to the rue
du petitbanqui the dai wa declin the snow which had ceas
for a moment had just begun again mariu post himself on the watch
at the veri corner of the rue du petitbanqui which wa desert as
usual and did not follow jondrett into it it wa lucki that he did
so for on arriv in the vicin of the wall where mariu had heard
the longhair man and the beard man convers jondrett turn
round made sure that no on wa follow him did not see him then
sprang across the wall and disappear
the wast land border by thi wall commun with the back yard of
an exliveri stablekeep of bad reput who had fail and who still
kept a few old singles berlin under hi shed
mariu thought that it would be wise to profit by jondrett absenc
to return home moreov it wa grow late everi even maam
bougon when she set out for her dishwash in town had a habit of
lock the door which wa alwai close at dusk mariu had given hi
kei to the inspector of polic it wa import therefor that he
should make hast
even had arriv night had almost close in on the horizon and in
the immens of space there remain but on spot illumin by the
sun and that wa the moon
it wa rise in a ruddi glow behind the low dome of salptrir
mariu return to no 5052 with great stride the door wa still
open when he arriv he mount the stair on tipto and glide along
the wall of the corridor to hi chamber thi corridor as the reader
will rememb wa border on both side by attic all of which were
for the moment empti and to let maam bougon wa in the habit of
leav all the door open as he pass on of these attic mariu
thought he perceiv in the uninhabit cell the motionless head of
four men vagu light up by a remnant of daylight fall through
a dormer window
mariu made no attempt to see not wish to be seen himself he
succeed in reach hi chamber without be seen and without make
ani nois it wa high time a moment later he heard maam bougon take
her departur lock the door of the hous behind her
chapter xviin which will be found the word to an english air which
wa in fashion in 1832
mariu seat himself on hi bed it might have been halfpast five
oclock onli half an hour separ him from what wa about to happen
he heard the beat of hi arteri as on hear the tick of a
watch in the dark he thought of the doubl march which wa go on at
that moment in the darkcrim advanc on on side justic come up
on the other he wa not afraid but he could not think without a
shudder of what wa about to take place as is the case with all those
who ar suddenli assail by an unforeseen adventur the entir dai
produc upon him the effect of a dream and in order to persuad
himself that he wa not the prei of a nightmar he had to feel the
cold barrel of the steel pistol in hi trouser pocket
it wa no longer snow the moon disengag itself more and more
clearli from the mist and it light mingl with the white reflect
of the snow which had fallen commun to the chamber a sort of
twilight aspect
there wa a light in the jondrett den mariu saw the hole in the wall
shine with a reddish glow which seem bloodi to him
it wa true that the light could not be produc by a candl howev
there wa not a sound in the jondrett quarter not a soul wa move
there not a soul speak not a breath the silenc wa glacial and
profound and had it not been for that light he might have thought
himself next door to a sepulchr
mariu softli remov hi boot and push them under hi bed
sever minut elaps mariu heard the lower door turn on it
hing a heavi step mount the staircas and hasten along the
corridor the latch of the hovel wa noisili lift it wa jondrett

candl in her hand she wa as she had been in the morn onli still
more repuls in thi light
she walk straight up to the bed mariu endur an indescrib
moment of anxieti but near the bed there wa a mirror nail to the
wall and it wa thither that she wa direct her step she rais
herself on tipto and look at herself in it in the neighbor room

she smooth her hair with the palm of her hand and smile into the
mirror hum with her crack and sepulchr voic

in the meantim mariu trembl it seem imposs to him that she
should not hear hi breath
she step to the window and look out with the halffoolish wai she

she return to the mirror and began again to put on air befor it

she cast a part glanc in the mirror and went out shut the door
behind her
a moment more and mariu heard the sound of the two young girl bare
feet in the corridor and jondrett voic shout to them
pai strict heed on on the side of the barrier the other at the
corner of the rue du petitbanqui dont lose sight for a moment of
the door of thi hous and the moment you see anyth rush here on

the father
thei ran downstair and a few second later the shock of the outer
door as it bang to announc that thei were outsid
there now remain in the hous onli mariu the jondrett and
probabl also the mysteri person of whom mariu had caught a
glimps in the twilight behind the door of the unus attic
chapter xviith us made of mariu fivefranc piec
mariu decid that the moment had now arriv when he must resum hi
post at hi observatori in a twinkl and with the agil of hi
ag he had reach the hole in the partit
he look
the interior of the jondrett apart present a curiou aspect and
mariu found an explan of the singular light which he had notic
a candl wa burn in a candlestick cover with verdigri but that
wa not what realli light the chamber the hovel wa complet
illumin as it were by the reflect from a rather larg
sheetiron brazier stand in the fireplac and fill with burn
charcoal the brazier prepar by the jondrett woman that morn the
charcoal wa glow hot and the brazier wa red a blue flame
flicker over it and help him to make out the form of the chisel
purchas by jondrett in the rue pierrelombard where it had been
thrust into the brazier to heat in on corner near the door and as
though prepar for some definit us two heap were visibl which
appear to be the on a heap of old iron the other a heap of rope
all thi would have caus the mind of a person who knew noth of
what wa in prepar to waver between a veri sinist and a veri
simpl idea the lair thu light up more resembl a forg than a
mouth of hell but jondrett in thi light had rather the air of a
demon than of a smith
the heat of the brazier wa so great that the candl on the tabl wa
melt on the side next the chafingdish and wa droop over an
old darklantern of copper worthi of diogen turn cartouch stood
on the chimneypiec
the brazier place in the fireplac itself besid the nearli extinct
brand sent it vapor up the chimnei and gave out no odor
the moon enter through the four pane of the window cast it
white into the crimson and flame garret and to the poetic spirit
of mariu who wa dreami even in the moment of action it wa like a
thought of heaven mingl with the misshapen reveri of earth
a breath of air which made it wai in through the open pane help to
dissip the smell of the charcoal and to conceal the presenc of the
brazier
the jondrett lair wa if the reader recal what we have said of the
gorbeau build admir chosen to serv as the theatr of a violent

rapid glanc around the room he had jondrett on hi left on the side
next the window and the jondrett woman and the four men on hi right
on the side next the door the four men did not stir and did not even

jondrett had again begun to speak in a plaintiv tone with so vagu
an ey and so lament an inton that m leblanc might have
suppos that what he had befor him wa a man who had simpli gone mad
with miseri

chapter xxthe trap
the door of the garret had just open abruptli and allow a view of
three men clad in blue linen blous and mask with mask of black

handl with the blade downward a butcher poleax for slaughter
cattl the third a man with thickset shoulder not so slender as
the first held in hi hand an enorm kei stolen from the door of
some prison
it appear that the arriv of these men wa what jondrett had been

m leblanc wa veri pale he wa scrutin everyth around him in
the den like a man who understand what he ha fallen into and hi
head direct in turn toward all the head which surround him move
on hi neck with an astonish and attent slow but there wa
noth in hi air which resembl fear he had improvis an
intrench out of the tabl and the man who but an instant
previous had born mere the appear of a kindli old man had
suddenli becom a sort of athlet and place hi robust fist on the
back of hi chair with a formid and surpris gestur
thi old man who wa so firm and so brave in the presenc of such a
danger seem to possess on of those natur which ar as courag
as thei ar kind both easili and simpli the father of a woman whom we
love is never a stranger to us mariu felt proud of that unknown man
three of the men of whom jondrett had said thei ar
chimneybuild had arm themselv from the pile of old iron on
with a heavi pair of shear the second with weighingtong the third
with a hammer and had place themselv across the entranc without
utter a syllabl the old man had remain on the bed and had
mere open hi ey the jondrett woman had seat herself besid
him
mariu decid that in a few second more the moment for intervent
would arriv and he rais hi right hand toward the ceil in the
direct of the corridor in readi to discharg hi pistol
jondrett have termin hi colloqui with the man with the cudgel
turn onc more to m leblanc and repeat hi question accompani
it with that low repress and terribl laugh which wa peculiar to
him
so you do not recogn me
m leblanc look him full in the face and repli
no
then jondrett advanc to the tabl he lean across the candl
cross hi arm put hi angular and feroci jaw close to m
leblanc calm face and advanc as far as possibl without forc
m leblanc to retreat and in thi postur of a wild beast who is
about to bite he exclaim

thnardier i am the innkeep of montfermeil do you understand
thnardier now do you know me
an almost impercept flush cross m leblanc brow and he repli
with a voic which neither trembl nor rose abov it ordinari level
with hi accustom placid
no more than befor
mariu did not hear thi repli ani on who had seen him at that moment
through the dark would have perceiv that he wa haggard stupid
thunderstruck at the moment when jondrett said my name is
thnardier mariu had trembl in everi limb and had lean against
the wall as though he felt the cold of a steel blade through hi
heart then hi right arm all readi to discharg the signal shot
drop slowli and at the moment when jondrett repeat thnardier
do you understand mariuss falter finger had come near let
the pistol fall jondrett by reveal hi ident had not move m
leblanc but he had quit upset mariu that name of thnardier with
which m leblanc did not seem to be acquaint mariu knew well let
the reader recal what that name meant to him that name he had worn on
hi heart inscrib in hi father testament he bore it at the
bottom of hi mind in the depth of hi memori in that sacr
injunct a certain thnardier save my life if my son encount
him he will do him all the good that li in hi power that name it
will be rememb wa on of the pieti of hi soul he mingl it
with the name of hi father in hi worship what thi man wa that
thnardier that innkeep of montfermeil whom he had so long and so
vainli sought he had found him at last and how hi father saviour
wa a ruffian that man to whose servic mariu wa burn to devot
himself wa a monster that liber of colonel pontmerci wa on the
point of commit a crime whose scope mariu did not as yet clearli
comprehend but which resembl an assassin and against whom
great god what a fatal what a bitter mockeri of fate hi father
had command him from the depth of hi coffin to do all the good in
hi power to thi thnardier and for four year mariu had cherish
no other thought than to acquit thi debt of hi father and at the
moment when he wa on the ev of have a brigand seiz in the veri
act of crime by justic destini cri to him thi is thnardier he
could at last repai thi man for hi father life save amid a
hailstorm of grapeshot on the heroic field of waterloo and repai it
with the scaffold he had sworn to himself that if ever he found that
thnardier he would address him onli by throw himself at hi feet
and now he actual had found him but it wa onli to deliv him over
to the execution hi father said to him succor thnardier and he
repli to that ador and saint voic by crush thnardier he wa
about to offer to hi father in hi grave the spectacl of that man who
had torn him from death at the peril of hi own life execut on the
place saintjacqu through the mean of hi son of that mariu to
whom he had entrust that man by hi will and what a mockeri to have
so long worn on hi breast hi father last command written in hi
own hand onli to act in so horribl contrari a sens but on the
other hand now look on that trap and not prevent it condemn the
victim and to spare the assassin could on be held to ani gratitud
toward so miser a wretch all the idea which mariu had cherish
for the last four year were pierc through and through as it were
by thi unforeseen blow
he shudder everyth depend on him unknown to themselv he
held in hi hand all those be who were move about there befor
hi ey if he fire hi pistol m leblanc wa save and thnardier
lost if he did not fire m leblanc would be sacrif and who
know thnardier would escap should he dash down the on or allow
the other to fall remors await him in either case
what wa he to do what should he choos be fals to the most
imperi souvenir to all those solemn vow to himself to the most
sacr duti to the most vener text should he ignor hi father
testament or allow the perpetr of a crime on the on hand it
seem to him that he heard hi ursul supplic for her father
and on the other the colonel commend thnardier to hi care he
felt that he wa go mad hi knee gave wai beneath him and he had
not even the time for deliber so great wa the furi with which
the scene befor hi ey wa hasten to it catastroph it wa like
a whirlwind of which he had thought himself the master and which wa
now sweep him awai he wa on the verg of swoon
in the meantim thnardier whom we shall henceforth call by no other
name wa pace up and down in front of the tabl in a sort of frenzi
and wild triumph
he seiz the candl in hi fist and set it on the chimneypiec with
so violent a bang that the wick came near be extinguish and the
tallow bespatt the wall
then he turn to m leblanc with a horribl look and spit out these
word
done for smoke brown cook spitchcock

phantom had risen there mariu heard hi heart beat in hi templ
he had the cannon of waterloo in hi ear hi bleed father vagu
depict on that sinist panel terrifi him and it seem to him
that the misshapen spectr wa gaze intent at him
when thnardier had recov hi breath he turn hi bloodshot ey

what have you to sai befor we put the handcuff on you
m leblanc held hi peac
in the midst of thi silenc a crack voic launch thi lugubri
sarcasm from the corridor
if there ani wood to be split im there
it wa the man with the ax who wa grow merri
at the same moment an enorm bristl and clayei face made it
appear at the door with a hideou laugh which exhibit not teeth
but fang
it wa the face of the man with the butcher ax
why have you taken off your mask cri thnardier in a rage
for fun retort the man
for the last few minut m leblanc had appear to be watch and

corridor the old man on the bed who seem under the influenc of
wine descend from the pallet and came reel up with a
stonebreak hammer in hi hand
on of the chimneybuild whose smirch face wa light up by
the candl and in whom mariu recogn in spite of hi daub
panchaud alia printani alia bigrenail lift abov m
leblanc head a sort of bludgeon made of two ball of lead at the two
end of a bar of iron
mariu could not resist thi sight my father he thought forgiv
me
and hi finger sought the trigger of hi pistol
the shot wa on the point of be discharg when thnardier voic
shout
dont harm him
thi desper attempt of the victim far from exasper thnardier
had calm him there exist in him two men the feroci man and the
adroit man up to that moment in the excess of hi triumph in the
presenc of the prei which had been brought down and which did not
stir the feroci man had prevail when the victim struggl and
tri to resist the adroit man reappear and took the upper hand
dont hurt him he repeat and without suspect it hi first
success wa to arrest the pistol in the act of be discharg and to
paralyz mariu in whose opinion the urgenc of the case disappear
and who in the face of thi new phase saw no inconveni in wait
a while longer
who know whether some chanc would not aris which would deliv him
from the horribl altern of allow ursul father to perish or
of destroi the colonel saviour
a herculean struggl had begun with on blow full in the chest m
leblanc had sent the old man tumbl roll in the middl of the
room then with two backward sweep of hi hand he had overthrown two
more assail and he held on under each of hi knee the wretch
were rattl in the throat beneath thi pressur as under a granit
millston but the other four had seiz the formid old man by both
arm and the back of hi neck and were hold him doubl up over the
two chimneybuild on the floor
thu the master of some and master by the rest crush those
beneath him and stifl under those on top of him endeavor in vain
to shake off all the effort which were heap upon him m leblanc
disappear under the horribl group of ruffian like the wild boar
beneath a howl pile of dog and hound
thei succeed in overthrow him upon the bed nearest the window and
there thei held him in aw the thnardier woman had not releas her
clutch on hi hair
dont you mix yourself up in thi affair said thnardier youll
tear your shawl
the thnardier obei as the femal wolf obei the male wolf with a
growl
now said thnardier search him you other fellow
m leblanc seem to have renounc the idea of resist
thei search him
he had noth on hi person except a leather purs contain six
franc and hi handkerchief
thnardier put the handkerchief into hi own pocket

never mind murmur the mask man who carri the big kei in the
voic of a ventriloquist he a tough old fellow
thnardier went to the corner near the door pick up a bundl of
rope and threw them at the men
tie him to the leg of the bed said he
and catch sight of the old man who had been stretch across the
room by the blow from m leblanc fist and who made no movement he
ad
is boulatruel dead

sweep him into a corner said thnardier
two of the chimneybuild push the drunken man into the corner
near the heap of old iron with their feet

did you bring so mani thei were not need
what can you do repli the man with the cudgel thei all want to
be in it thi is a bad season there no busi go on
the pallet on which m leblanc had been thrown wa a sort of hospit
bed elev on four coars wooden leg roughli hewn
m leblanc let them take their own cours
the ruffian bound him secur in an upright attitud with hi feet
on the ground at the head of the bed the end which wa most remot
from the window and nearest to the fireplac
when the last knot had been ti thnardier took a chair and seat
himself almost face m leblanc
thnardier no longer look like himself in the cours of a few
moment hi face had pass from unbridl violenc to tranquil and
cun sweet
mariu found it difficult to recogn in that polish smile of a man
in offici life the almost bestial mouth which had been foam but a
moment befor he gaze with amaz on that fantast and alarm
metamorphosi and he felt as a man might feel who should behold a
tiger convert into a lawyer
monsieur said thnardier
and dismiss with a gestur the ruffian who still kept their hand
on m leblanc
stand off a littl and let me have a talk with the gentleman
all retir toward the door
he went on
monsieur you did wrong to try to jump out of the window you might
have broken your leg now if you will permit me we will convers
quietli in the first place i must commun to you an observ
which i have made which is that you have not utter the faintest
cry
thnardier wa right thi detail wa correct although it had escap
mariu in hi agit m leblanc had bare pronounc a few word
without rais hi voic and even dure hi struggl with the six
ruffian near the window he had preserv the most profound and
singular silenc
thnardier continu
mon dieu you might have shout stop thief a bit and i should not
have thought it improp murder that too is said occasion
and so far as i am concern i should not have taken it in bad part
it is veri natur that you should make a littl row when you find
yourself with person who dont inspir you with suffici confid
you might have done that and no on would have troubl you on that
account you would not even have been gag and i will tell you why
thi room is veri privat that it onli recommend but it ha
that in it favor you might fire off a mortar and it would produc
about as much nois at the nearest polic station as the snore of a
drunken man here a cannon would make a boum and the thunder would
make a pouf it a handi lodg but in short you did not shout
and it is better so i present you my compliment and i will tell you
the conclus that i draw from that fact my dear sir when a man
shout who come the polic and after the polic justic well you
have not made an outcri that is becaus you dont care to have the
polic and the court come in ani more than we do it is becausei
have long suspect ityou have some interest in hide someth on
our side we have the same interest so we can come to an
understand
as he spoke thu it seem as though thnardier who kept hi ey
fix on m leblanc were try to plung the sharp point which
dart from the pupil into the veri conscienc of hi prison
moreov hi languag which wa stamp with a sort of moder
subdu insol and crafti insol wa reserv and almost choic

cry all thi it must be confess now that hi attent had been
call to it troubl mariu and affect him with pain
astonish
thnardier wellground observ still further obscur for
mariu the dens mysteri which envelop that grave and singular person
on whom courfeyrac had bestow the sobriquet of monsieur leblanc
but whoever he wa bound with rope surround with execution
half plung so to speak in a grave which wa close in upon him to
the extent of a degre with everi moment that pass in the presenc
of thnardier wrath as in the presenc of hi sweet thi man
remain impass and mariu could not refrain from admir at such
a moment the superbl melancholi visag
here evid wa a soul which wa inaccess to terror and which
did not know the mean of despair here wa on of those men who
command amaz in desper circumst extrem as wa the
crisi inevit as wa the catastroph there wa noth here of
the agoni of the drown man who open hi horrorfil ey under

thnardier rose in an unpretend manner went to the fireplac
shove asid the screen which he lean against the neighbor
pallet and thu unmask the brazier full of glow coal in which
the prison could plainli see the chisel whitehot and spot here
and there with tini scarlet star

thnardier warm hi feet
the prison had relaps into hi taciturn a sombr calm had

while hi exasper wife vocifer thnardier had seat himself

befor the seven men had time to collect their sens and dash forward
he had bent down into the fireplac had stretch out hi hand to the
brazier and had then straighten himself up again and now
thnardier the femal thnardier and the ruffian huddl in

unscrew it and us it as a saw to cut the cord which fasten him
which would explain the faint nois and almost impercept movement

1831 and 1832 the two year which ar immedi connect with the
revolut of juli form on of the most peculiar and strike moment
of histori these two year rise like two mountain midwai between
those which preced and those which follow them thei have a
revolutionari grandeur precipic ar to be distinguish there the
social mass the veri assiz of civil the solid group of
superpos and adher interest the centuryold profil of the
ancient french format appear and disappear in them everi instant
athwart the storm cloud of system of passion and of theori
these appear and disappear have been design as movement
and resist at interv truth that daylight of the human soul
can be descri shine there
thi remark epoch is decidedli circumscrib and is begin to be
suffici distant from us to allow of our grasp the princip
line even at the present dai
we shall make the attempt
the restor had been on of those intermedi phase hard to
defin in which there is fatigu buzz murmur sleep tumult and
which ar noth els than the arriv of a great nation at a
haltingplac
these epoch ar peculiar and mislead the politician who desir to
convert them to profit in the begin the nation ask noth but
repos it thirst for but on thing peac it ha but on ambit
to be small which is the translat of remain tranquil of great
event great hazard great adventur great men thank god we have
seen enough we have them heap higher than our head we would
exchang csar for prusia and napoleon for the king of yvetot what
a good littl king wa he we have march sinc daybreak we have
reach the even of a long and toilsom dai we have made our first
chang with mirabeau the second with robespierr the third with
bonapart we ar worn out each on demand a bed
devot which is weari heroism which ha grown old ambit which
ar sate fortun which ar made seek demand implor solicit
what a shelter thei have it thei take possess of peac of
tranquil of leisur behold thei ar content but at the same
time certain fact aris compel recognit and knock at the door in
their turn these fact ar the product of revolut and war thei
ar thei exist thei have the right to instal themselv in societi
and thei do instal themselv therein and most of the time fact ar
the steward of the household and fouriers32 who do noth but prepar
lodg for principl
thi then is what appear to philosoph politician
at the same time that weari men demand repos accomplish fact
demand guarante guarante ar the same to fact that repos is to
men
thi is what england demand of the stuart after the protector thi
is what franc demand of the bourbon after the empir
these guarante ar a necess of the time thei must be accord
princ grant them but in realiti it is the forc of thing which
give them a profound truth and on us to know which the stuart
did not suspect in 1662 and which the bourbon did not even obtain a
glimps of in 1814
the predestin famili which return to franc when napoleon fell
had the fatal simplic to believ that it wa itself which bestow
and that what it had bestow it could take back again that the hous
of bourbon possess the right divin that franc possess noth
and that the polit right conced in the charter of loui xviii
wa mere a branch of the right divin wa detach by the hous of
bourbon and gracious given to the peopl until such dai as it should
pleas the king to reassum it still the hous of bourbon should have
felt from the displeasur creat by the gift that it did not come
from it
thi hous wa churlish to the nineteenth centuri it put on an
illtemp look at everi develop of the nation to make us of a
trivial word that is to sai of a popular and a true word it look
glum the peopl saw thi
it thought it possess strength becaus the empir had been carri
awai befor it like a theatric stageset it did not perceiv
that it had itself been brought in in the same fashion it did not
perceiv that it also lai in that hand which had remov napoleon
it thought that it had root becaus it wa the past it wa mistaken
it form a part of the past but the whole past wa franc the root
of french societi were not fix in the bourbon but in the nation
these obscur and live root constitut not the right of a famili
but the histori of a peopl thei were everywher except under the
throne
the hous of bourbon wa to franc the illustri and bleed knot in
her histori but wa no longer the princip element of her destini
and the necessari base of her polit she could get along without the
bourbon she had done without them for two and twenti year there had
been a break of continu thei did not suspect the fact and how
should thei have suspect it thei who fanci that loui xvii
reign on the 9th of thermidor and that loui xviii wa reign at
the battl of marengo never sinc the origin of histori had princ
been so blind in the presenc of fact and the portion of divin
author which fact contain and promulg never had that pretens
here below which is call the right of king deni to such a point
the right from on high
a capit error which led thi famili to lai it hand onc more on the
guarante grant in 1814 on the concess as it term them
sad a sad thing what it term it concess were our conquest
what it term our encroach were our right
when the hour seem to it to have come the restor suppos
itself victori over bonapart and wellroot in the countri that
is to sai believ itself to be strong and deep abruptli decid on
it plan of action and risk it stroke on morn it drew itself
up befor the face of franc and elev it voic it contest
the collect titl and the individu right of the nation to
sovereignti of the citizen to liberti in other word it deni to
the nation that which made it a nation and to the citizen that which
made him a citizen
thi is the foundat of those famou act which ar call the
ordin of juli the restor fell
it fell justli but we admit it had not been absolut hostil to
all form of progress great thing had been accomplish with it
alongsid
under the restor the nation had grown accustom to calm
discuss which had been lack under the republ and to grandeur
in peac which had been want under the empir franc free and
strong had offer an encourag spectacl to the other peopl of
europ the revolut had had the word under robespierr the cannon
had had the word under bonapart it wa under loui xviii and charl

light of mind could be seen flicker a magnific us and

the fall of the bourbon wa full of grandeur not on their side but
on the side of the nation thei quit the throne with graviti but
without author their descent into the night wa not on of those

neither the spectral calm of charl i nor the eagl scream of

sensibl of the collabor of some on who is work abov man
the revolut of juli is the triumph of right overthrow the fact a
thing which is full of splendor
right overthrow the fact henc the brillianc of the revolut of
1830 henc also it mild right triumphant ha no need of be
violent
right is the just and the true
the properti of right is to remain etern beauti and pure the
fact even when most necessari to all appear even when most
thoroughli accept by contemporari if it exist onli as a fact and
if it contain onli too littl of right or none at all is infal
destin to becom in the cours of time deform impur perhap
even monstrou if on desir to learn at on blow to what degre of
hideous the fact can attain view at the distanc of centuri
let him look at machiavelli machiavelli is not an evil geniu nor a
demon nor a miser and cowardli writer he is noth but the fact
and he is not onli the italian fact he is the european fact the fact
of the sixteenth centuri he seem hideou and so he is in the
presenc of the moral idea of the nineteenth
thi conflict of right and fact ha been go on ever sinc the origin
of societi to termin thi duel to amalgam the pure idea with
the human realiti to caus right to penetr pacif into the
fact and the fact into right that is the task of sage
chapter iibadli sew
but the task of sage is on thing the task of clever men is anoth
the revolut of 1830 came to a sudden halt
as soon as a revolut ha made the coast the skil make hast to
prepar the shipwreck
the skil in our centuri have confer on themselv the titl of
statesmen so that thi word statesmen ha end by becom
somewhat of a slang word it must be born in mind in fact that
wherev there is noth but skill there is necessarili petti to
sai the skil amount to sai the mediocr
in the same wai to sai statesmen is sometim equival to sai
traitor if then we ar to believ the skil revolut like
the revolut of juli ar sever arteri a prompt ligatur is
indispens the right too grandli proclaim is shaken also
right onc firmli fix the state must be strengthen liberti onc
assur attent must be direct to power
here the sage ar not as yet separ from the skil but thei
begin to be distrust power veri good but in the first place
what is power in the second whenc come it the skil do not seem
to hear the murmur object and thei continu their manuvr
accord to the politician who ar ingeni in put the mask of
necess on profit fiction the first requir of a peopl
after a revolut when thi peopl form part of a monarch
contin is to procur for itself a dynasti in thi wai sai thei
peac that is to sai time to dress our wound and to repair the
hous can be had after a revolut the dynasti conceal the
scaffold and cover the ambul now it is not alwai easi to
procur a dynasti
if it is absolut necessari the first man of geniu or even the
first man of fortun who come to hand suffic for the manufactur
of a king you have in the first case napoleon in the second
iturbid
but the first famili that come to hand doe not suffic to make a
dynasti there is necessarili requir a certain modicum of antiqu
in a race and the wrinkl of the centuri cannot be improvis
if we place ourselv at the point of view of the statesmen after
make all allow of cours after a revolut what ar the
qualiti of the king which result from it he mai be and it is us
for him to be a revolutionari that is to sai a particip in hi own
person in that revolut that he should have lent a hand to it that
he should have either compromis or distinguish himself therein
that he should have touch the ax or wield the sword in it
what ar the qualiti of a dynasti it should be nation that is to
sai revolutionari at a distanc not through act commit but by
reason of idea accept it should be compos of past and be
histor be compos of futur and be sympathet
all thi explain why the earli revolut content themselv with
find a man cromwel or napoleon and why the second absolut
insist on find a famili the hous of brunswick or the hous of
orlean
royal hous resembl those indian figtre each branch of which
bend over to the earth take root and becom a figtre itself
each branch mai becom a dynasti on the sole condit that it shall
bend down to the peopl
such is the theori of the skil
here then li the great art to make a littl render to success the
sound of a catastroph in order that those who profit by it mai trembl
from it also to season with fear everi step that is taken to augment
the curv of the transit to the point of retard progress to dull
that aurora to denounc and retrench the harsh of enthusiasm to
cut all angl and nail to wad triumph to muffl up right to
envelop the giantpeopl in flannel and to put it to bed veri
speedili to impos a diet on that excess of health to put hercul on
the treatment of a convalesc to dilut the event with the
expedi to offer to spirit thirst for the ideal that nectar
thin out with a potion to take on precaut against too much
success to garnish the revolut with a shade

the attempt ha been made and wrongli to make a class of the

on is not a class becaus on ha commit a fault selfish is

moreov we must be just to selfish the state to which that part
of the nation which is call the bourgeoisi aspir after the shock
of 1830 wa not the inertia which is complic with indiffer and
lazi and which contain a littl shame it wa not the slumber
which presuppos a momentari forget access to dream it
wa the halt
the halt is a word form of a singular doubl and almost contradictori

the halt is the restor of forc it is repos arm and on the
alert it is the accomplish fact which post sentinel and hold
itself on it guard
the halt presuppos the combat of yesterdai and the combat of

it is the partit between 1830 and 1848

in short a lofti and origin figur a princ who understood how to
creat author in spite of the uneasi of franc and power in
spite of the jealousi of europ loui philipp will be class among
the emin men of hi centuri and would be rank among the most
illustri governor of histori had he love glori but a littl and
if he had had the sentiment of what is great to the same degre as the
feel for what is us
loui philipp had been handsom and in hi old ag he remain
grace not alwai approv by the nation he alwai wa so by the
mass he pleas he had that gift of charm he lack majesti he
wore no crown although a king and no white hair although an old man
hi manner belong to the old regim and hi habit to the new a
mixtur of the nobl and the bourgeoi which suit 1830 loui
philipp wa transit reign he had preserv the ancient
pronunci and the ancient orthographi which he place at the
servic of opinion modern he love poland and hungari but he wrote
le polonoi and he pronounc le hongrai he wore the uniform
of the nation guard like charl x and the ribbon of the legion of
honor like napoleon
he went a littl to chapel not at all to the chase never to the
opera incorrupt by sacristan by whippersin by balletdanc
thi made a part of hi bourgeoi popular he had no heart he went
out with hi umbrella under hi arm and thi umbrella long form a

someth of a doctor he bled a postilion who had tumbl from hi
hors loui philipp no more went about without hi lancet than did
henri iv without hi poniard the royalist jeer at thi ridicul
king the first who had ever shed blood with the object of heal
for the grievanc against loui philipp there is on deduct to be
made there is that which accus royalti that which accus the

nation wa the do of the king
as will be seen the proper deduct have been made the king
charg is decreas
thi is hi great fault he wa modest in the name of franc
whenc aris thi fault
we will state it
loui philipp wa rather too much of a patern king that incub
of a famili with the object of found a dynasti is afraid of
everyth and doe not like to be disturb henc excess timid
which is displeas to the peopl who have the 14th of juli in their
civil and austerlitz in their militari tradit
moreov if we deduct the public duti which requir to be fulfil
first of all that deep tender of loui philipp toward hi famili
wa deserv by the famili that domest group wa worthi of
admir virtu there dwelt side by side with talent on of loui
philipp daughter mari dorlean place the name of her race
among artist as charl dorlean had place it among poet she made
of her soul a marbl which she name jeann darc two of loui
philipp daughter elicit from metternich thi eulogium thei ar
young peopl such as ar rare seen and princ such as ar never
seen
thi without ani dissimul and also without ani exagger is
the truth about loui philipp
to be princ equal to bear in hi own person the contradict of
the restor and the revolut to have that disquiet side of
the revolutionari which becom reassur in govern power therein
lai the fortun of loui philipp in 1830 never wa there a more
complet adapt of a man to an event the on enter into the
other and the incarn took place loui philipp is 1830 made man
moreov he had in hi favor that great recommend to the throne
exil he had been proscrib a wander poor he had live by hi
own labor in switzerland thi heir to the richest princ domain in
franc had sold an old hors in order to obtain bread at reichenau he
gave lesson in mathemat while hi sister adelaid did wool work
and sew these souvenir connect with a king render the
bourgeoisi enthusiast he had with hi own hand demolish the
iron cage of montsaintmichel built by loui xi and us by loui
xv he wa the companion of dumouriez he wa the friend of lafayett
he had belong to the jacobin club mirabeau had slap him on the
shoulder danton had said to him young man at the ag of four and
twenti in 93 be then m de chartr he had wit from the
depth of a box the trial of loui xvi so well name that poor
tyrant the blind clairvoy of the revolut break royalti in
the king and the king with royalti did so almost without notic the
man in the fierc crush of the idea the vast storm of the
assemblytribun the public wrath interrog capet not know
what to repli the alarm stupefi vacil by that royal head
beneath that sombr breath the rel innoc of all in that
catastroph of those who condemn as well as of the man condemnedh
had look on those thing he had contempl that giddi he had
seen the centuri appear befor the bar of the assemblyconvent he
had beheld behind loui xvi that unfortun passerbi who wa made
respons the terribl culprit the monarchi rise through the
shadow and there had linger in hi soul the respect fear of
these immens justic of the populac which ar almost as imperson
as the justic of god
the trace left in him by the revolut wa prodigi it memori wa
like a live imprint of those great year minut by minut on dai
in the presenc of a wit whom we ar not permit to doubt he
rectifi from memori the whole of the letter a in the alphabet
list of the constitu assembl
loui philipp wa a king of the broad daylight while he reign the
press wa free the tribun wa free conscienc and speech were free
the law of septemb ar open to sight although fulli awar of the
gnaw power of light on privileg he left hi throne expos to the
light histori will do justic to him for thi loyalti
loui philipp like all histor men who have pass from the scene
is todai put on hi trial by the human conscienc hi case is as
yet onli in the lower court
the hour when histori speak with it free and vener accent ha
not yet sound for him the moment ha not come to pronounc a
definit judgment on thi king the auster and illustri historian
loui blanc ha himself recent soften hi first verdict loui
philipp wa elect by those two almost which ar call the 221
and 1830 that is to sai by a halfparlia and a halfrevolut
and in ani case from the superior point of view where philosophi must
place itself we cannot judg him here as the reader ha seen abov
except with certain reserv in the name of the absolut democrat
principl in the ey of the absolut outsid these two right the
right of man in the first place the right of the peopl in the second
all is usurp but what we can sai even at the present dai that
after make these reserv is that to sum up the whole and in
whatev manner he is consid loui philipp taken in himself and
from the point of view of human good will remain to us the
antiqu languag of ancient histori on of the best princ who ever
sat on a throne
what is there against him that throne take awai loui philipp the
king there remain the man and the man is good he is good at time
even to the point of be admir often in the midst of hi
gravest souvenir after a dai of conflict with the whole diplomaci of
the contin he return at night to hi apart and there
exhaust with fatigu overwhelm with sleep what did he do he took
a death sentenc and pass the night in revis a crimin suit
consid it someth to hold hi own against europ but that it
wa a still greater matter to rescu a man from the execution he
obstin maintain hi opinion against hi keeper of the seal he
disput the ground with the guillotin foot by foot against the crown
attornei those chatter of the law as he call them sometim
the pile of sentenc cover hi tabl he examin them all it wa
anguish to him to abandon these miser condemn head on dai he
said to the same wit to whom we have recent refer i won
seven last night dure the earli year of hi reign the death
penalti wa as good as abolish and the erect of a scaffold wa a
violenc commit against the king the grve have disappear with
the elder branch a bourgeoi place of execut wa institut under
the name of the barriresaintjacqu practic men felt the
necess of a quasilegitim guillotin and thi wa on of the
victori of casimir prier who repres the narrow side of the
bourgeoisi over loui philipp who repres it liber side
loui philipp annot beccaria with hi own hand after the fieschi
machin he exclaim what a piti that i wa not wound then i
might have pardon on anoth occas allud to the resist
offer by hi ministri he wrote in connect with a polit
crimin who is on of the most gener figur of our dai hi
pardon is grant it onli remain for me to obtain it loui philipp
wa as gentl as loui ix and as kindli as henri iv
now to our mind in histori where kind is the rarest of pearl
the man who is kindli almost take preced of the man who is great
loui philipp have been sever judg by some harshli perhap
by other it is quit natur that a man himself a phantom at the
present dai who knew that king should come and testifi in hi favor
befor histori thi deposit whatev els it mai be is evid
and abov all thing entir disinterest an epitaph pen by a
dead man is sincer on shade mai consol anoth shade the share
of the same shadow confer the right to prais it it is not greatli

chapter ivcrack beneath the foundat
at the moment when the drama which we ar narrat is on the point of
penetr into the depth of on of the tragic cloud which envelop
the begin of loui philipp reign it wa necessari that there
should be no equivoqu and it becam requisit that thi book should
offer some explan with regard to thi king
loui philipp had enter into possess of hi royal author
without violenc without ani direct action on hi part by virtu of a
revolutionari chang evid quit distinct from the real aim of the
revolut but in which he the duc dorlan exercis no person
initi he had been born a princ and he believ himself to have
been elect king he had not serv thi mandat on himself he had
not taken it it had been offer to him and he had accept it
convinc wrongli to be sure but convinc nevertheless that the
offer wa in accord with right and that the accept of it wa in
accord with duti henc hi possess wa in good faith now we
sai it in good conscienc loui philipp be in possess in
perfect good faith and the democraci be in good faith in it
attack the amount of terror discharg by the social conflict weigh
neither on the king nor on the democraci a clash of principl
resembl a clash of element the ocean defend the water the
hurrican defend the air the king defend royalti the democraci
defend the peopl the rel which is the monarchi resist the
absolut which is the republ societi bleed in thi conflict but
that which constitut it suffer todai will constitut it safeti
later on and in ani case those who combat ar not to be blame on
of the two parti is evid mistaken the right is not like the
colossu of rhode on two shore at onc with on foot on the
republ and on in royalti it is indivis and all on on side
but those who ar in error ar so sincer a blind man is no more a
crimin than a vendean is a ruffian let us then imput to the
fatal of thing alon these formid collis whatev the
natur of these tempest mai be human irrespons is mingl with

there ar in revolut swimmer who go against the current thei
ar the old parti
for the old parti who clung to hered by the grace of god think
that revolut have sprung from the right to revolt on ha the
right to revolt against them error for in these revolut the on
who revolt is not the peopl it is the king revolut is precis
the contrari of revolt everi revolut be a normal outcom
contain within itself it legitimaci which fals revolutionist
sometim dishonor but which remain even when soil which surviv
even when stain with blood
revolut spring not from an accid but from necess a
revolut is a return from the fictiti to the real it is becaus
it must be that it is
nonetheless did the old legitimist parti assail the revolut of
1830 with all the vehem which aris from fals reason error
make excel projectil thei strike it cleverli in it vulner
spot in default of a cuirass in it lack of logic thei attack thi
revolut in it royalti thei shout to it revolut why thi
king faction ar blind men who aim correctli
thi cry wa utter equal by the republican but come from them
thi cry wa logic what wa blind in the legitimist wa
clear of vision in the democrat 1830 had bankrupt the peopl

the reader will not be surpris if for variou reason we do not

the question rais by social we confin ourselv to indic

all the problem that the socialist propos to themselv cosmogon
vision reveri and mystic be cast asid can be reduc to two
princip problem
first problem to produc wealth
second problem to share it
the first problem contain the question of work
the second contain the question of salari
in the first problem the employ of forc is in question
in the second the distribut of enjoy
from the proper employ of forc result public power
from a good distribut of enjoy result individu happi
by a good distribut not an equal but an equit distribut must
be understood
from these two thing combin the public power without individu
happi within result social prosper
social prosper mean the man happi the citizen free the nation

chapter ith lark meadow
mariu had wit the unexpect termin of the ambush upon
whose track he had set javert but javert had no sooner quit the
build bear off hi prison in three hackneycoach than
mariu also glide out of the hous it wa onli nine oclock in the
even mariu betook himself to courfeyrac courfeyrac wa no longer
the imperturb inhabit of the latin quarter he had gone to live
in the rue de la verreri for polit reason thi quarter wa on
where at that epoch insurrect like to instal itself mariu said
to courfeyrac i have come to sleep with you courfeyrac drag a
mattress off hi bed which wa furnish with two spread it out on
the floor and said there
at seven oclock on the follow morn mariu return to the
hovel paid the quarter rent which he ow to maam bougon had hi
book hi bed hi tabl hi commod and hi two chair load on a
handcart and went off without leav hi address so that when javert
return in the cours of the morn for the purpos of question
mariu as to the event of the preced even he found onli maam
bougon who answer move awai
maam bougon wa convinc that mariu wa to some extent an accomplic
of the robber who had been seiz the night befor who would ever
have said it she exclaim to the portress of the quarter a young
man like that who had the air of a girl
mariu had two reason for thi prompt chang of resid the first
wa that he now had a horror of that hous where he had beheld so
close at hand and in it most repuls and most feroci
develop a social deform which is perhap even more terribl
than the wick rich man the wick poor man the second wa that he
did not wish to figur in the lawsuit which would insu in all
probabl and be brought in to testifi against thnardier
javert thought that the young man whose name he had forgotten wa
afraid and had fled or perhap had not even return home at the
time of the ambush he made some effort to find him howev but
without success
a month pass then anoth mariu wa still with courfeyrac he had
learn from a young licenti in law an habitu frequent of the
court that thnardier wa in close confin everi mondai mariu
had five franc hand in to the clerk offic of la forc for
thnardier
as mariu had no longer ani monei he borrow the five franc from
courfeyrac it wa the first time in hi life that he had ever borrow
monei these period five franc were a doubl riddl to courfeyrac
who lent and to thnardier who receiv them to whom can thei go
thought courfeyrac whenc can thi come to me thnardier ask
himself
moreov mariu wa heartbroken everyth had plung through a
trapdoor onc more he no longer saw anyth befor him hi life wa
again buri in mysteri where he wander fumblingli he had for a
moment beheld veri close at hand in that obscur the young girl
whom he love the old man who seem to be her father those unknown
be who were hi onli interest and hi onli hope in thi world
and at the veri moment when he thought himself on the point of
grasp them a gust had swept all these shadow awai not a spark of
certainti and truth had been emit even in the most terribl of
collis no conjectur wa possibl he no longer knew even the name
that he thought he knew it certainli wa not ursul and the lark wa
a nicknam and what wa he to think of the old man wa he actual in
hide from the polic the whitehair workman whom mariu had
encount in the vicin of the invalid recur to hi mind it
now seem probabl that that workingman and m leblanc were on and
the same person so he disguis himself that man had hi heroic and
hi equivoc side why had he not call for help why had he fled
wa he or wa he not the father of the young girl wa he in short
the man whom thnardier thought that he recogn thnardier might
have been mistaken these form so mani insolubl problem all thi
it is true detract noth from the angel charm of the young girl
of the luxembourg heartrend distress mariu bore a passion in hi
heart and night over hi ey he wa thrust onward he wa drawn and
he could not stir all had vanish save love of love itself he had
lost the instinct and the sudden illumin ordinarili thi flame
which burn us light us also a littl and cast some us gleam
without but mariu no longer even heard these mute counsel of
passion he never said to himself what if i were to go to such a
place what if i were to try such and such a thing the girl whom he
could no longer call ursul wa evid somewher noth warn
mariu in what direct he should seek her hi whole life wa now
sum up in two word absolut uncertainti within an impenetr
fog to see her onc again he still aspir to thi but he no longer
expect it
to crown all hi poverti had return he felt that ici breath close
to him on hi heel in the midst of hi torment and long befor
thi he had discontinu hi work and noth is more danger than
discontinu work it is a habit which vanish a habit which is easi
to get rid of and difficult to take up again
a certain amount of dream is good like a narcot in discreet
dose it lull to sleep the fever of the mind at labor which ar
sometim sever and produc in the spirit a soft and fresh vapor
which correct the overharsh contour of pure thought fill in gap
here and there bind togeth and round off the angl of the idea
but too much dream sink and drown woe to the brainwork who
allow himself to fall entir from thought into reveri he think
that he can reascend with equal eas and he tell himself that after
all it is the same thing error
thought is the toil of the intellig reveri it voluptu to
replac thought with reveri is to confound a poison with a food
mariu had begun in that wai as the reader will rememb passion had
superven and had finish the work of precipit him into chimra
without object or bottom on no longer emerg from on self except
for the purpos of go off to dream idl product tumultu and
stagnant gulf and in proport as labor diminish need increas
thi is a law man in a state of reveri is gener prodig and
slack the unstrung mind cannot hold life within close bound
there is in that mode of life good mingl with evil for if
enerv is bale generos is good and health but the poor
man who is gener and nobl and who doe not work is lost
resourc ar exhaust need crop up
fatal decliv down which the most honest and the firmest as well as
the most feebl and most viciou ar drawn and which end in on of
two hold suicid or crime
by dint of go outdoor to think the dai come when on goe out to
throw on self in the water
excess of reveri breed men like escouss and lebra
mariu wa descend thi decliv at a slow pace with hi ey
fix on the girl whom he no longer saw what we have just written
seem strang and yet it is true the memori of an absent be
kindl in the dark of the heart the more it ha disappear the
more it beam the gloomi and despair soul see thi light on it
horizon the star of the inner night shethat wa mariu whole
thought he medit of noth els he wa confusedli consciou that
hi old coat wa becom an imposs coat and that hi new coat wa
grow old that hi shirt were wear out that hi hat wa wear
out that hi boot were give out and he said to himself if i
could but see her onc again befor i die
on sweet idea alon wa left to him that she had love him that her
glanc had told him so that she did not know hi name but that she
did know hi soul and that wherev she wa howev mysteri the
place she still love him perhap who know whether she were not
think of him as he wa think of her sometim in those
inexplic hour such as ar experienc by everi heart that love
though he had no reason for anyth but sad and yet felt an
obscur quiver of joi he said to himself it is her thought that ar
come to me then he ad perhap my thought reach her also
thi illus at which he shook hi head a moment later wa
suffici nevertheless to throw beam which at time resembl
hope into hi soul from time to time especi at that even hour
which is the most depress to even the dreami he allow the purest
the most imperson the most ideal of the reveri which fill hi
brain to fall upon a notebook which contain noth els he call
thi write to her
it must not be suppos that hi reason wa derang quit the
contrari he had lost the faculti of work and of move firmli
toward ani fix goal but he wa endow with more clearsighted
and rectitud than ever mariu survei by a calm and real although
peculiar light what pass befor hi ey even the most indiffer
deed and men he pronounc a just critic on everyth with a sort
of honest deject and candid disinterested hi judgment which
wa almost wholli disassoci from hope held itself aloof and soar
on high
in thi state of mind noth escap him noth deceiv him and
everi moment he wa discov the foundat of life of human
and of destini happi even in the midst of anguish is he to whom god
ha given a soul worthi of love and of unhappi he who ha not
view the thing of thi world and the heart of man under thi doubl
light ha seen noth and know noth of the true

what he repeat to himself shall i not see her again befor
then
when you have ascend the rue saintjacqu left the barrier on on
side and follow the old inner boulevard for some distanc you reach
the rue de la sant then the glacir and a littl while befor
arriv at the littl river of the gobelin you come to a sort of
field which is the onli spot in the long and monoton chain of the
boulevard of pari where ruysdael would be tempt to sit down
there is someth indescrib there which exhal grace a green
meadow travers by tightli stretch line from which flutter rag
dry in the wind and an old marketgarden hous built in the

the lark wa the appel which had replac ursul in the depth of

peculiar to these mysteri asid thi is her meadow i shall know

it wa absurd but irresist

the brujon of 1811 wa the father of the brujon of 1832
the latter of whom the reader caught but a glimps at the gorbeau

bewild and plaintiv air it wa in consequ of thi plaintiv
air that the magistr had releas him think him more us in
the charlemagn yard than in close confin
robber do not interrupt their profess becaus thei ar in the hand
of justic thei do not let themselv be put out by such a trifl as
that to be in prison for on crime is no reason for not begin on
anoth crime thei ar artist who have on pictur in the salon and
who toil nonetheless on a new work in their studio
brujon seem to be stupefi by prison he could sometim be seen
stand by the hour togeth in front of the sutler window in the
charlemagn yard stare like an idiot at the sordid list of price
which began with garlic 62 centim and end with cigar 5
centim or he pass hi time in trembl chatter hi teeth
sai that he had a fever and inquir whether on of the eight and
twenti bed in the fever ward wa vacant

bed and write someth by the light of the halllamp the guardian
enter brujon wa put in a solitari cell for a month but thei were
not abl to seiz what he had written the polic learn noth
further about it
what is certain is that on the follow morn a postilion wa
flung from the charlemagn yard into the lion ditch over the
fivestori build which separ the two courtyard
what prison call a postilion is a pallet of bread artist
mould which is sent into ireland that is to sai over the roof
of a prison from on courtyard to anoth etymolog over england

prison and fox in the gallei the note is taken to the offic and
hand over to the polic
on thi occas the postilion reach it address although the
person to whom it wa address wa at that moment in solitari
confin thi person wa no other than babet on of the four head
of patron minett
the postilion contain a roll of paper on which onli these two line
were written
babet there is an affair in the rue plumet a gate on a garden
thi is what brujon had written the night befor
in spite of male and femal searcher babet manag to pass the note
on from la forc to the salptrir to a good friend whom he had and
who wa shut up there thi woman in turn transmit the note to
anoth woman of her acquaint a certain magnon who wa strongli
suspect by the polic though not yet arrest thi magnon whose
name the reader ha alreadi seen had relat with the thnardier
which will be describ in detail later on and she could by go to
see ponin serv as a bridg between the salptrir and le

it happen that at precis that moment as proof were want in
the investig direct against thnardier in the matter of hi

magnon who wa watch the gate of the madelonett hand her
brujon note to babet charg her to look into the matter
ponin went to the rue plumet recogn the gate and the garden

of pari have a mistress and conceal the fact for at that period
the grand seignor displai their mistress and the bourgeoi
conceal them had a littl hous built in the faubourg
saintgermain in the desert rue blomet which is now call rue
plumet not far from the spot which wa then design as combat de
animaux
thi hous wa compos of a singlestori pavilion two room on the
ground floor two chamber on the first floor a kitchen downstair a
boudoir upstair an attic under the roof the whole preced by a
garden with a larg gate open on the street thi garden wa about
an acr and a half in extent thi wa all that could be seen by
passersbi but behind the pavilion there wa a narrow courtyard and
at the end of the courtyard a low build consist of two room and
a cellar a sort of prepar destin to conceal a child and nurs
in case of need thi build commun in the rear by a mask
door which open by a secret spring with a long narrow pave
wind corridor open to the sky hem in with two lofti wall
which hidden with wonder art and lost as it were between garden
enclosur and cultiv land all of whose angl and detour it
follow end in anoth door also with a secret lock which open a
quarter of a leagu awai almost in anoth quarter at the solitari
extrem of the rue du babylon
through thi the chief justic enter so that even those who were
spy on him and follow him would mere have observ that the
justic betook himself everi dai in a mysteri wai somewher and
would never have suspect that to go to the rue de babylon wa to go
to the rue blomet thank to clever purchas of land the magistr
had been abl to make a secret sewerlik passag on hi own properti
and consequ without interfer later on he had sold in littl
parcel for garden and market garden the lot of ground adjoin
the corridor and the proprietor of these lot on both side thought
thei had a parti wall befor their ey and did not even suspect the
long pave ribbon wind between two wall amid their flowerb and
their orchard onli the bird beheld thi curios it is probabl
that the linnet and tomtit of the last centuri gossip a great deal
about the chief justic
the pavilion built of stone in the tast of mansard wainscot and

fifteen year ago in 93 a coppersmith had purchas the hous with
the idea of demolish it but had not been abl to pai the price the
nation made him bankrupt so that it wa the hous which demolish the

gentli incit everi dai that thu the convent wa henceforth the
univers for her as it wa for him that he should grow old there and

possibl on reflect upon thi he fell into perplex he
interrog himself he ask himself if all that happi were
realli hi if it were not compos of the happi of anoth of the
happi of that child which he an old man wa confisc and
steal if that were not theft he said to himself that thi child
had a right to know life befor renounc it that to depriv her in
advanc and in some sort without consult her of all joi under
the pretext of save her from all trial to take advantag of her
ignor of her isol in order to make an artifici vocat
germin in her wa to rob a human creatur of it natur and to lie
to god and who know if when she came to be awar of all thi some
dai and found herself a nun to her sorrow cosett would not come to
hate him a last almost selfish thought and less heroic than the
rest but which wa intoler to him he resolv to quit the
convent
he resolv on thi he recogn with anguish the fact that it wa
necessari as for object there were none five year sojourn
between these four wall and of disappear had necessarili destroi
or dispers the element of fear he could return tranquilli among
men he had grown old and all had undergon a chang who would
recogn him now and then to face the worst there wa danger onli
for himself and he had no right to condemn cosett to the cloister for
the reason that he had been condemn to the gallei besid what is
danger in comparison with the right final noth prevent hi
be prudent and take hi precaut

vow should have receiv her educ gratuit he humbl beg
the reverend prioress to see fit that he should offer to the commun

of five thousand franc
it wa thu that jean valjean quit the convent of the perpetu
ador
on leav the convent he took in hi own arm the littl valis the
kei to which he still wore on hi person and would permit no porter to

nevertheless jean valjean did not reappear in the open air without
profound anxieti
he discov the hous in the rue plumet and hid himself from sight
there henceforth he wa in the possess of the nameultim
fauchelev
at the same time he hire two other apart in pari in order that
he might attract less attent than if he were to remain alwai in the
same quarter and so that he could at need take himself off at the
slightest disquietud which should assail him and in short so that he
might not again be caught unprovid as on the night when he had so
miracul escap from javert these two apart were veri
pitiabl poor in appear and in two quarter which were far remot
from each other the on in the rue de louest the other in the rue de

cosett had been taught housekeep in the convent and she regul
their expenditur which wa veri modest everi dai jean valjean put
hi arm through cosett and took her for a walk he led her to the
luxembourg to the least frequent walk and everi sundai he took her
to mass at saintjacquesduhautpa becaus that wa a long wai off

himself for water to a fountain nearbi on the boulevard their wood and
wine were put into a halfsubterranean hollow line with rockwork
which lai near the rue de babylon and which had formerli serv the

hous no love wa without a grotto
in the door open on the rue de babylon there wa a box destin
for the recept of letter and paper onli as the three inhabit

the entir us of that box formerli the gobetween of a love

had not been abl to escap through the fine mesh of the censu of

neither jean valjean nor cosett nor toussaint ever enter or emerg
except by the door on the rue de babylon unless seen through the

cosett had left the convent when she wa still almost a child she wa
a littl more than fourteen and she wa at the ungrat ag we
have alreadi said that with the except of her ey she wa home
rather than pretti she had no ungrac featur but she wa awkward
thin timid and bold at onc a grownup littl girl in short
her educ wa finish that is to sai she ha been taught
religion and even and abov all devot then histori that is to
sai the thing that bear that name in convent geographi grammar the
participl the king of franc a littl music a littl draw
etc but in all other respect she wa utterli ignor which is a
great charm and a great peril the soul of a young girl should not be
left in the dark later on mirag that ar too abrupt and too live

discreetli enlighten rather with the reflect of realiti than
with their harsh and direct light a us and gracious auster

noth suppli the place of thi instinct all the nun in the world
ar not worth as much as on mother in the format of a young girl

cosett had had no mother she had onli had mani mother in the
plural
as for jean valjean he wa inde all tender all solicitud
but he wa onli an old man and he knew noth at all
now in thi work of educ in thi grave matter of prepar a
woman for life what scienc is requir to combat that vast ignor
which is call innoc

obscur of the mind sombr and secret abod where the passion
immedi find a lodgement as soon as the open gate permit them to
enter the convent is a compress which in order to triumph over the
human heart should last dure the whole life
on quit the convent cosett could have found noth more sweet
and more danger than the hous in the rue plumet it wa the
continu of solitud with the begin of liberti a garden that
wa close but a natur that wa acrid rich voluptu and
fragrant the same dream as in the convent but with glimps of young
men a grate but on that open on the street
still when she arriv there we repeat she wa onli a child jean
valjean gave thi neglect garden over to her do what you like with
it he said to her thi amus cosett she turn over all the
clump and all the stone she hunt for beast she plai in it
while await the time when she would dream in it she love thi
garden for the insect that she found beneath her feet amid the grass
while await the dai when she would love it for the star that she
would see through the bough abov her head
and then she love her father that is to sai jean valjean with all
her soul with an innoc filial passion which made the goodman a
belov and charm companion to her it will be rememb that m
madelein had been in the habit of read a great deal jean valjean
had continu thi practic he had come to convers well he possess
the secret rich and the eloqu of a true and humbl mind which ha

and again she said to him
father why do you eat horribl bread like that
becaus my daughter
well if you eat it i will eat it too
then in order to prevent cosett eat black bread jean valjean at
white bread
cosett had but a confus recollect of her childhood she prai
morn and even for her mother whom she had never known the
thnardier had remain with her as two hideou figur in a dream
she rememb that she had gone on dai at night to fetch water in
a forest she thought that it had been veri far from pari it seem
to her that she had begun to live in an abyss and that it wa jean
valjean who had rescu her from it her childhood produc upon her
the effect of a time when there had been noth around her but
millep spider and serpent when she medit in the even
befor fall asleep as she had not a veri clear idea that she wa
jean valjean daughter and that he wa her father she fanci that
the soul of her mother had pass into that good man and had come to
dwell near her
when he wa seat she lean her cheek against hi white hair and
drop a silent tear sai to herself perhap thi man is my

silent if she repeat her question he respond with a smile onc
she insist the smile end in a tear
thi silenc on the part of jean valjean cover fantin with dark
wa it prudenc wa it respect wa it a fear that he should deliv
thi name to the hazard of anoth memori than hi own
so long as cosett had been small jean valjean had been will to
talk to her of her mother when she becam a young girl it wa
imposs for him to do so it seem to him that he no longer dare
wa it becaus of cosett wa it becaus of fantin he felt a certain
religi horror at let that shadow enter cosett thought and of
place a third in their destini the more sacr thi shade wa to
him the more did it seem that it wa to be fear he thought of
fantin and felt himself overwhelm with silenc
through the dark he vagu perceiv someth which appear to
have it finger on it lip had all the modesti which had been in

howev jean valjean wa happi
when cosett went out with him she lean on hi arm proud and happi

on dai cosett chanc to look at herself in her mirror and she said
to herself realli it seem to her almost that she wa pretti thi
threw her in a singularli troubl state of mind up to that moment she
had never thought of her face she saw herself in her mirror but she
did not look at herself and then she had so often been told that she
wa home jean valjean alon said gentli no inde no inde at
all event cosett had alwai thought herself home and had grown up
in that belief with the easi resign of childhood and here all at
onc wa her mirror sai to her as jean valjean had said no
inde that night she did not sleep what if i were pretti she
thought how odd it would be if i were pretti and she recal those
of her companion whose beauti had produc a sensat in the convent
and she said to herself what am i to be like mademoisel
soandso
the next morn she look at herself again not by accid thi
time and she wa assail with doubt where did i get such an idea
said she no i am ugli she had not slept well that wa all her
ey were sunken and she wa pale she had not felt veri joyou on the
preced even in the belief that she wa beauti but it made her
veri sad not to be abl to believ in it ani longer she did not look
at herself again and for more than a fortnight she tri to dress her
hair with her back turn to the mirror
in the even after dinner she gener embroid in wool or did
some convent needlework in the drawingroom and jean valjean read
besid her onc she rais her ey from her work and wa render
quit uneasi by the manner in which her father wa gaze at her

her that some on behind her whom she did not see said a pretti
woman but badli dress bah she thought he doe not mean me i
am well dress and ugli she wa then wear a plush hat and her
merino gown
at last on dai when she wa in the garden she heard poor old

had spoken there could no longer be ani doubt of that she descend
to the garden again think herself a queen imagin that she heard
the bird sing though it wa winter see the sky gild the sun
among the tree flower in the thicket distract wild in
inexpress delight
jean valjean on hi side experienc a deep and undefin
oppress at heart
in fact he had for some time past been contempl with terror
that beauti which seem to grow more radiant everi dai on cosett
sweet face the dawn that wa smile for all wa gloomi for him
cosett had been beauti for a toler long time befor she becam
awar of it herself but from the veri first dai that unexpect
light which wa rise slowli and envelop the whole of the young
girl person wound jean valjean sombr ey he felt that it wa a
chang in a happi life a life so happi that he did not dare to move
for fear of disarrang someth thi man who had pass through
all manner of distress who wa still all bleed from the bruis
of fate who had been almost wick and who had becom almost a saint
who after have drag the chain of the gallei wa now drag
the invis but heavi chain of indefinit miseri thi man whom the
law had not releas from it grasp and who could be seiz at ani
moment and brought back from the obscur of hi virtu to the broad
daylight of public opprobrium thi man accept all excus all
pardon all and mere ask of provid of man of the law of
societi of natur of the world on thing that cosett might love
him
that cosett might continu to love him that god would not prevent the
heart of the child from come to him and from remain with him
belov by cosett he felt that he wa heal rest appeas

well with him he ask noth more had ani on said to him do you
want anyth better he would have answer no god might have
said to him do you desir heaven and he would have repli i

everyth which could affect thi situat if onli on the surfac
made him shudder like the begin of someth new he had never
known veri distinctli himself what the beauti of a woman mean but he
understood instinct that it wa someth terribl
he gaze with terror on thi beauti which wa blossom out ever more
triumphant and superb besid him beneath hi veri ey on the

whole scienc of the bonnet the gown the mantl the boot the cuff
the stuff which is in fashion the color which is becom that
scienc which make of the parisian woman someth so charm so
deep and so danger the word headi woman were invent for the
parisienn
in less than a month littl cosett in that thebaid of the rue de
babylon wa not onli on of the prettiest but on of the best
dress women in pari which mean a great deal more
she would have like to encount her passerbi to see what he would
sai and to teach him a lesson the truth is that she wa ravish
in everi respect and that she distinguish the differ between a
bonnet from grard and on from herbaut in the most marvel wai
jean valjean watch these ravag with anxieti he who felt that he
could never do anyth but crawl walk at the most beheld wing
sprout on cosett
moreov from the mere inspect of cosett toilet a woman would
have recogn the fact that she had no mother certain littl
proprieti certain special convention were not observ by
cosett a mother for instanc would have told her that a young girl
doe not dress in damask
the first dai that cosett went out in her black damask gown and
mantl and her white crape bonnet she took jean valjean arm gai
radiant rosi proud dazzl father she said how do you like me
in thi guis jean valjean repli in a voic which resembl the
bitter voic of an enviou man charm he wa the same as usual
dure their walk on their return home he ask cosett

heretofor ask to remain at home sai father i enjoi myself
more here with you now wa alwai ask to go out in fact what is
the us of have a handsom face and a delici costum if on doe

he also notic that cosett had no longer the same tast for the back
garden now she prefer the garden and did not dislik to promenad
back and forth in front of the rail fenc jean valjean who wa shy
never set foot in the garden he kept to hi back yard like a dog
cosett in gain the knowledg that she wa beauti lost the
grace of ignor it an exquisit grace for beauti enhanc by
ingenu is ineff and noth is so ador as a dazzl
and innoc creatur who walk along hold in her hand the kei to
paradis without be consciou of it but what she had lost in
ingenu grace she gain in pensiv and seriou charm her whole
person permeat with the joi of youth of innoc and of beauti
breath forth a splendid melancholi
it wa at thi epoch that mariu after the laps of six month saw
her onc more at the luxembourg
chapter vith battl begun
cosett in her shadow like mariu in hi wa all readi to take fire
destini with it mysteri and fatal patienc slowli drew togeth
these two be all charg and all languish with the stormi
electr of passion these two soul which were laden with love as
two cloud ar laden with lightn and which were bound to overflow
and mingl in a look like the cloud in a flash of fire
the glanc ha been so much abus in love romanc that it ha final
fallen into disreput on hardli dare to sai nowadai that two
be fell in love becaus thei look at each other that is the wai
peopl do fall in love nevertheless and the onli wai the rest is
noth but the rest come afterward noth is more real than these
great shock which two soul convei to each other by the exchang of
that spark
at that particular hour when cosett unconsci dart that glanc
which troubl mariu mariu had no suspicion that he had also
launch a look which disturb cosett
he caus her the same good and the same evil
she had been in the habit of see him for a long time and she had
scrutin him as girl scrutin and see while look elsewher
mariu still consid cosett ugli when she had alreadi begun to
think mariu handsom but as he paid no attent to her the young
man wa noth to her
still she could not refrain from sai to herself that he had
beauti hair beauti ey handsom teeth a charm tone of
voic when she heard him convers with hi comrad that he held
himself badli when he walk if you like but with a grace that wa
all hi own that he did not appear to be at all stupid that hi whole
person wa nobl gentl simpl proud and that in short though he
seem to be poor yet hi air wa fine
on the dai when their ey met at last and said to each other those
first obscur and ineff thing which the glanc lisp cosett
did not immedi understand she return thoughtfulli to the hous
in the rue de louest where jean valjean accord to hi custom had
come to spend six week the next morn on wake she thought of
that strang young man so long indiffer and ici who now seem to
pai attent to her and it did not appear to her that thi attent
wa the least in the world agreeabl to her she wa on the contrari
somewhat incens at thi handsom and disdain individu a
substratum of war stir within her it struck her and the idea
caus her a wholli childish joi that she wa go to take her
reveng at last
know that she wa beauti she wa thoroughli consciou though in
an indistinct fashion that she possess a weapon women plai with
their beauti as children do with a knife thei wound themselv
the reader will recal mariu hesit hi palpit hi
terror he remain on hi bench and did not approach thi vex
cosett on dai she said to jean valjean father let us stroll
about a littl in that direct see that mariu did not come to
her she went to him in such case all women resembl mahomet and
then strang to sai the first symptom of true love in a young man is
timid in a young girl it is bold thi is surpris and yet
noth is more simpl it is the two sex tend to approach each
other and assum each the other qualiti
that dai cosett glanc drove mariu besid himself and mariu
glanc set cosett to trembl mariu went awai confid and
cosett uneasi from that dai forth thei ador each other
the first thing that cosett felt wa a confus and profound
melancholi it seem to her that her soul had becom black sinc the
dai befor she no longer recogn it the white of soul in young
girl which is compos of cold and gayeti resembl snow it
melt in love which is it sun
cosett did not know what love wa she had never heard the word
utter in it terrestri sens on the book of profan music which
enter the convent amour love wa replac by tambour drum or
pandour thi creat enigma which exercis the imagin of the
big girl such as ah how delight is the drum or piti is
not a pandour but cosett had left the convent too earli to have
occupi herself much with the drum therefor she did not know what
name to give to what she now felt is ani on the less ill becaus on
doe not know the name of on maladi
she love with all the more passion becaus she love ignorantli she
did not know whether it wa a good thing or a bad thing us or
danger etern or temporari allow or prohibit she love
she would have been greatli astonish had ani on said to her you
do not sleep but that is forbidden you do not eat why that is veri
bad you have oppress and palpit of the heart that must not
be you blush and turn pale when a certain be clad in black appear
at the end of a certain green walk but that is abomin she would
not have understood and she would have repli what fault is there
of mine in a matter in which i have no power and of which i know
noth
it turn out that the love which present itself wa exactli suit
to the state of her soul it wa a sort of admir at a distanc a
mute contempl the deific of a stranger it wa the
apparit of youth to youth the dream of night becom a realiti yet
remain a dream the longedfor phantom realiz and made flesh at
last but have as yet neither name nor fault nor spot nor
exig nor defect in a word the distant lover who linger in the
ideal a chimra with a form ani nearer and more palpabl meet
would have alarm cosett at thi first stage when she wa still half
immers in the exagger mist of the cloister she had all the
fear of children and all the fear of nun combin the spirit of the
convent with which she had been permeat for the space of five year
wa still in the process of slow evapor from her person and made
everyth trembl around her in thi situat he wa not a lover he
wa not even an admir he wa a vision she set herself to ador
mariu as someth charm lumin and imposs
as extrem innoc border on extrem coquetri she smile at him
with all frank
everi dai she look forward to the hour for their walk with
impati she found mariu there she felt herself unspeak happi
and thought in all sincer that she wa express her whole thought
when she said to jean valjean
what a delici garden that luxembourg is
mariu and cosett were in the dark as to on anoth thei did not
address each other thei did not salut each other thei did not know
each other thei saw each other and like star of heaven which ar
separ by million of leagu thei live by gaze at each other
it wa thu that cosett gradual becam a woman and develop
beauti and love with a conscious of her beauti and in
ignor of her love she wa a coquett to boot through her
ignor

is the properti of grief to caus the childish side of man to reappear
he had an unconquer convict that cosett wa escap from him
he would have like to resist to retain her to arous her enthusiasm
by some extern and brilliant matter these idea pueril as we have
just said and at the same time senil convei to him by their veri
childish a toler just notion of the influenc of gold lace on
the imagin of young girl he onc chanc to see a gener on
horseback in full uniform pass along the street comt coutard the
command of pari he envi that gild man what happi it would
be he said to himself if he could put on that suit which wa an
incontest thing and if cosett could behold him thu she would be
dazzl and when he had cosett on hi arm and pass the gate of the
tuileri the guard would present arm to him and that would suffic
for cosett and would dispel her idea of look at young men
an unforeseen shock wa ad to these sad reflect
in the isol life which thei led and sinc thei had come to dwell
in the rue plumet thei had contract on habit thei sometim took a
pleasur trip to see the sun rise a mild speci of enjoy which

there it meant solitud to him and liberti to her there she becam a
littl girl onc more she could run and almost plai she took off her
hat laid it on jean valjean knee and gather bunch of flower
she gaze at the butterfli on the flower but did not catch them
gentl and tender ar born with love and the young girl who
cherish within her breast a trembl and fragil ideal ha merci on
the wing of a butterfli she wove garland of poppi which she place
on her head and which cross and penetr with sunlight glow
until thei flame form for her rosi face a crown of burn ember
even after their life had grown sad thei kept up their custom of earli
stroll
on morn in octob therefor tempt by the seren perfect of
the autumn of 1831 thei set out and found themselv at break of dai
near the barrir du main it wa not dawn it wa daybreak a
delight and stern moment a few constel here and there in the
deep pale azur the earth all black the heaven all white a quiver
amid the blade of grass everywher the mysteri chill of twilight
a lark which seem mingl with the star wa carol at a
prodigi height and on would have declar that that hymn of
petti calm immens in the east the valdegrc project it
dark mass on the clear horizon with the sharp of steel venu
dazzlingli brilliant wa rise behind that dome and had the air of a
soul make it escap from a gloomi edific
all wa peac and silenc there wa no on on the road a few strai
labor of whom thei caught bare a glimps were on their wai to
their work along the sidepath
jean valjean wa sit in a crosswalk on some plank deposit at
the gate of a timberyard hi face wa turn toward the highwai hi
back toward the light he had forgotten the sun which wa on the point
of rise he had sunk into on of those profound absorpt in which
the mind becom concentr which imprison even the ey and which
ar equival to four wall there ar medit which mai be call
vertic when on is at the bottom of them time is requir to return
to earth jean valjean had plung into on of these reveri he wa
think of cosett of the happi that wa possibl if noth came
between him and her of the light with which she fill hi life a
light which wa but the eman of her soul he wa almost happi in
hi reveri cosett who wa stand besid him wa gaze at the
cloud as thei turn rosi
all at onc cosett exclaim father i should think some on wa
come yonder jean valjean rais hi ey
cosett wa right the causewai which lead to the ancient barrir du
main is a prolong as the reader know of the rue de svre and
is cut at right angl by the inner boulevard at the elbow of the
causewai and the boulevard at the spot where it branch thei heard a
nois which it wa difficult to account for at that hour and a sort of
confus pile made it appear some shapeless thing which wa
come from the boulevard wa turn into the road
it grew larger it seem to move in an orderli manner though it wa
bristl and quiver it seem to be a vehicl but it load could
not be distinctli made out there were hors wheel shout whip
were crack by degre the outlin becam fix although bath in
shadow it wa a vehicl in fact which had just turn from the
boulevard into the highwai and which wa direct it cours toward
the barrier near which sat jean valjean a second of the same aspect
follow then a third then a fourth seven chariot made their
appear in success the head of the hors touch the rear of
the wagon in front figur were move on these vehicl flash were
visibl through the dusk as though there were nake sword there a
clank becam audibl which resembl the rattl of chain and as
thi someth advanc the sound of voic wax louder and it
turn into a terribl thing such as emerg from the cave of dream
as it drew nearer it assum a form and wa outlin behind the tree
with the pallid hue of an apparit the mass grew white the dai
which wa slowli dawn cast a wan light on thi swarm heap which
wa at onc both sepulchr and live the head of the figur turn
into the face of corps and thi is what it prove to be
seven wagon were drive in a file along the road the first six were
singularli construct thei resembl cooper drai thei consist
of long ladder place on two wheel and form barrow at their rear
extrem each drai or rather let us sai each ladder wa attach
to four hors har tandem on these ladder strang cluster of
men were be drawn in the faint light these men were to be divin
rather than seen twentyfour on each vehicl twelv on a side back
to back face the passersbi their leg dangl in the airthi
wa the manner in which these men were travel and behind their
back thei had someth which clank and which wa a chain and on
their neck someth which shone and which wa an iron collar each
man had hi collar but the chain wa for all so that if these four
and twenti men had occas to alight from the drai and walk thei were
seiz with a sort of inexor uniti and were oblig to wind over
the ground with the chain for a backbon somewhat after the fashion of
millep in the back and front of each vehicl two men arm with
musket stood erect each hold on end of the chain under hi foot
the iron necklet were squar the seventh vehicl a huge racksid
baggag wagon without a hood had four wheel and six hors and
carri a sonor pile of iron boiler castiron pot brazier and
chain among which were mingl sever men who were pinion and
stretch at full length and who seem to be ill thi wagon all
latticework wa garnish with dilapid hurdl which appear to
have serv for former punish these vehicl kept to the middl
of the road on each side march a doubl hedg of guard of infam
aspect wear threecorn hat like the soldier under the
directori shabbi cover with spot and hole muffl in uniform of
veteran and the trouser of undertak men half grai half blue
which were almost hang in rag with red epaulet yellow shoulder
belt short sabr musket and cudgel thei were a speci of
soldierblackguard these myrmidon seem compos of the abject

appear to be their chief held a postilion whip in hi hand all
these detail blur by the dim of dawn becam more and more
clearli outlin as the light increas at the head and in the rear of
the convoi rode mount gendarm seriou and with sword in fist
thi process wa so long that when the first vehicl reach the
barrier the last wa bare debauch from the boulevard a throng
sprung it is imposs to sai whenc and form in a twinkl as
is frequent the case in pari press forward from both side of the
road and look on in the neighbor lane the shout of peopl
call to each other and the wooden shoe of marketgarden
hasten up to gaze were audibl
the men mass upon the drai allow themselv to be jolt along in
silenc thei were livid with the chill of morn thei all wore linen
trouser and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoe the rest
of their costum wa a fantasi of wretched their accoutr
were horribl incongru noth is more funer than the harlequin
in rag batter felt hat tarpaulin cap hideou woollen nightcap
and side by side with a short blous a black coat broken at the
elbow mani wore women headgear other had basket on their head
hairi breast were visibl and through the rent in their garment
tattoo design could be descri templ of love flame heart
cupid erupt and unhealthi red blotch could also be seen two or
three had a straw rope attach to the crossbar of the drai and
suspend under them like a stirrup which support their feet on of
them held in hi hand and rais to hi mouth someth which had the
appear of a black stone and which he seem to be gnaw it wa
bread which he wa eat there were no ey there which were not
either dry dull or flame with an evil light the escort troop

were terribl their feet hung down their shoulder oscil their
head clash togeth their fetter clank their ey glare

with laughter
thi file of vehicl whatev it natur wa wa mourn it wa

descend that it might be follow by anoth and anoth and that
their dilapid garment would be drench that onc soak these
men would not get dry again that onc chill thei would not again

the downpour that the water would fill their shoe that no lash
from the whip would be abl to prevent their jaw from chatter
that the chain would continu to bind them by the neck that their leg
would continu to dangl and it wa imposs not to shudder at the
sight of these human be thu bound and passiv beneath the cold
cloud of autumn and deliv over to the rain to the blast to all

some dai later on morn when the sun wa shine brightli and
thei were both on the step lead to the garden anoth infract
of the rule which jean valjean seem to have impos upon himself
and to the custom of remain in her chamber which melancholi had

mani littl children cosett wa rather merri in the even it wa
at thi epoch that thei paid their visit to the jondrett den
on the dai follow that visit jean valjean made hi appear in
the pavilion in the morn calm as wa hi wont but with a larg
wound on hi left arm which wa much inflam and veri angri which

after a fashion glide over him unnot he had succeed in make
hi escap all trace of him wa lostwhat more did he care for he
onli thought of those wretch be to piti them here thei ar in

he thought but what a lament famili in distress
as for the hideou vision of the barrir du main cosett had not

song which delight jean valjean
spring came the garden wa so delight at that season of the year
that jean valjean said to cosett
you never go there i want you to stroll in it
as you like father said cosett
and for the sake of obei her father she resum her walk in the
garden gener alon for as we have mention jean valjean who

she did not perceiv that she laugh everi moment and that she wa

then by wai of dinner he tri to sleep
it wa a catnap with on ey open while he doze gavroch kept on
the watch

a livid line between two row of dark bush
all at onc in thi whitish band two figur made their appear
on wa in front the other some distanc in the rear
there come two creatur mutter gavroch
the first form seem to be some elderli bourgeoi who wa bent and
thought dress more than plainli and who wa walk slowli
becaus of hi ag and stroll about in the open even air
the second wa straight firm slender it regul it pace by that
of the first but in the voluntari slow of it gait suppl and
agil were discern thi figur had also someth fierc and
disquiet about it the whole shape wa that of what wa then call
an eleg the hat wa of good shape the coat black well cut
probabl of fine cloth and well fit in at the waist the head wa
held erect with a sort of robust grace and beneath the hat the pale
profil of a young man could be made out in the dim light the profil
had a rose in it mouth thi second form wa well known to gavroch
it wa montparnass
he could have told noth about the other except that he wa a
respect old man
gavroch immedi began to take observ
on of these two pedestrian evid had a project connect with the
other gavroch wa well place to watch the cours of event the
bedroom had turn into a hidingplac at a veri opportun moment
montparnass on the hunt at such an hour in such a place betoken
someth threaten gavroch felt hi gamin heart move with
compass for the old man
what wa he to do interfer on weak come to the aid of
anoth it would be mere a laugh matter for montparnass
gavroch did not shut hi ey to the fact that the old man in the
first place and the child in the second would make but two mouth
for that redoubt ruffian eighteen year of ag
while gavroch wa deliber the attack took place abruptli and
hideous the attack of the tiger on the wild ass the attack of the
spider on the fly montparnass suddenli toss awai hi rose bound
upon the old man seiz him by the collar grasp and clung to him
and gavroch with difficulti restrain a scream a moment later on of
these men wa underneath the other groan struggl with a knee
of marbl upon hi breast onli it wa not just what gavroch had
expect the on who lai on the earth wa montparnass the on who
wa on top wa the old man all thi took place a few pace distant
from gavroch
the old man had receiv the shock had return it and that in such a
terribl fashion that in a twinkl the assail and the assail
had exchang rle

were each by the other as their breath mingl in the struggl
silenc ensu montparnass ceas hi struggl gavroch indulg in
thi asid can he be dead
the goodman had not utter a word nor given vent to a cry he rose to
hi feet and gavroch heard him sai to montparnass
get up
montparnass rose but the goodman held him fast montparnass
attitud wa the humili and furiou attitud of the wolf who ha
been caught by a sheep
gavroch look on and listen make an effort to reinforc hi ey
with hi ear he wa enjoi himself immens
he wa repaid for hi conscienti anxieti in the charact of a
spectat he wa abl to catch on the wing a dialogu which borrow
from the dark an indescrib tragic accent the goodman

stood motionless and did not relax hi hold on montparnass
everi moment the vigor and agil young ruffian indulg in the
twitch of a wild beast caught in a snare he gave a jerk tri a
crook of the knee twist hi limb desper and made effort to
escap
the old man did not appear to notic it and held both hi arm with
on hand with the sovereign indiffer of absolut forc
the old man reveri last for some time then look steadili at

to the rue de babylon it wa usual when monei wa lack in the
hous that jean valjean took these littl trip
so jean valjean wa absent he had said i shall return in three
dai
that even cosett wa alon in the drawingroom in order to get
rid of her ennui she had open her pianoorgan and had begun to
sing accompani herself the while the choru from euryanth
hunter astrai in the wood which is probabl the most beauti
thing in all the sphere of music when she had finish she remain
wrap in thought
all at onc it seem to her that she heard the sound of footstep in
the garden
it could not be her father he wa absent it could not be toussaint
she wa in bed and it wa ten oclock at night
she step to the shutter of the drawingroom which wa close and
laid her ear against it
it seem to her that it wa the tread of a man and that he wa
walk veri softli
she mount rapidli to the first floor to her own chamber open a
small wicket in her shutter and peep into the garden the moon wa
at the full everyth could be seen as plainli as by dai
there wa no on there
she open the window the garden wa absolut calm and all that wa
visibl wa that the street wa desert as usual
cosett thought that she had been mistaken she thought that she had
heard a nois it wa a hallucin produc by the melancholi and
magnific choru of weber which lai open befor the mind terrifi
depth which trembl befor the gaze like a dizzi forest and in
which on hear the crackl of dead branch beneath the uneasi tread
of the huntsmen of whom on catch a glimps through the twilight
she thought no more about it
moreov cosett wa not veri timid by natur there flow in her
vein some of the blood of the bohemian and the adventuress who run
barefoot it will be rememb that she wa more of a lark than a
dove there wa a foundat of wild and braveri in her
on the follow dai at an earlier hour toward nightfal she wa
stroll in the garden in the midst of the confus thought which
occupi her she fanci that she caught for an instant a sound
similar to that of the preced even as though some on were
walk beneath the tree in the dusk and not veri far from her but
she told herself that noth so close resembl a step on the grass
as the friction of two branch which have move from side to side and
she paid no heed to it besid she could see noth
she emerg from the thicket she had still to cross a small lawn to
regain the step
the moon which had just risen behind her cast cosett shadow in
front of her upon thi lawn as she came out from the shrubberi
cosett halt in alarm
besid her shadow the moon outlin distinctli upon the turf anoth
shadow which wa particularli startl and terribl a shadow which
had a round hat
it wa the shadow of a man who must have been stand on the border
of the clump of shrubberi a few pace in the rear of cosett
she stood for a moment without the power to speak or cry or call or
stir or turn her head
then she summon up all her courag and turn round resolut
there wa no on there
she glanc on the ground the figur had disappear
she reenter the thicket search the corner boldli went as far as
the gate and found noth
she felt herself absolut chill with terror wa thi anoth
hallucin what two dai in success on hallucin might
pass but two hallucin the disquiet point about it wa that
the shadow had assuredli not been a phantom phantom do not wear round
hat
on the follow dai jean valjean return cosett told him what she
thought she had heard and seen she want to be reassur and to see
her father shrug hi shoulder and sai to her you ar a littl
goos
jean valjean grew anxiou
it cannot be anyth said he
he left her under some pretext and went into the garden and she saw
him examin the gate with great attent
dure the night she woke up thi time she wa sure and she
distinctli heard some on walk close to the flight of step beneath
her window she ran to her littl wicket and open it in point of
fact there wa a man in the garden with a larg club in hi hand
just as she wa about to scream the moon light up the man profil
it wa her father she return to her bed sai to herself he is
veri uneasi
jean valjean pass that night and the two succeed night in the
garden cosett saw him through the hole in her shutter
on the third night the moon wa on the wane and had begun to rise
later at on oclock in the morn possibl she heard a loud burst
of laughter and her father voic call her
cosett
she jump out of bed threw on her dressinggown and open her
window
her father wa stand on the grassplot below
i have wake you for the purpos of reassur you said he look
there is your shadow with the round hat
and he point out to her on the turf a shadow cast by the moon and
which did inde bear consider resembl to the spectr of a man
wear a round hat it wa the shadow produc by a chimneypip of
sheet iron with a hood which rose abov a neighbor roof
cosett join in hi laughter all her lugubri supposit were
allai and the next morn as she wa at breakfast with her father
she made merri over the sinist garden haunt by the shadow of iron
chimneypot
jean valjean becam quit tranquil onc more as for cosett she did
not pai much attent to the question whether the chimneypot wa
realli in the direct of the shadow which she had seen or thought
she had seen and whether the moon had been in the same spot in the
sky
she did not question herself as to the peculiar of a chimneypot
which is afraid of be caught in the act and which retir when some
on look at it shadow for the shadow had taken the alarm when
cosett had turn round and cosett had thought herself veri sure of
thi cosett seren wa fulli restor the proof appear to her
to be complet and it quit vanish from her mind whether there
could possibl be ani on walk in the garden dure the even or
at night

fact but she could not refrain from ad

assassin befor we had time to sai ouf and monsieur doe not
sleep in the hous to boot but fear noth miss i fasten the
shutter up like prison lone women that is enough to make on
shudder i believ you just imagin what if you were to see men enter

chamber bolt her door look under her couch went to bed and slept
badli all night long she saw that big stone as larg as a mountain
and full of cavern
at sunriseth properti of the rise sun is to make us laugh at all
our terror of the past night and our laughter is in direct proport
to our terror which thei have causedat sunris cosett when she
woke view her fright as a nightmar and said to herself what have
i been think of it is like the footstep that i thought i heard a
week or two ago in the garden at night it is like the shadow of the
chimneypot am i becom a coward the sun which wa glow
through the crevic in her shutter and turn the damask curtain
crimson reassur her to such an extent that everyth vanish from
her thought even the stone
there wa no more a stone on the bench than there wa a man in a round
hat in the garden i dream about the stone as i did all the rest
she dress herself descend to the garden ran to the bench and
broke out in a cold perspir the stone wa there
but thi last onli for a moment that which is terror by night is
curios by dai
bah said she come let us see what it is
she lift the stone which wa toler larg beneath it wa
someth which resembl a letter it wa a white envelop cosett
seiz it there wa no address on on side no seal on the other yet
the envelop though unseal wa not empti paper could be seen
insid
cosett examin it it wa no longer alarm it wa no longer
curios it wa a begin of anxieti
cosett drew from the envelop it content a littl notebook of
paper each page of which wa number and bore a few line in a veri
fine and rather pretti handwrit as cosett thought
cosett look for a name there wa none to whom wa thi address
to her probabl sinc a hand had deposit the packet on her bench
from whom did it come an irresist fascin took possess of
her she tri to turn awai her ey from the leaflet which were
trembl in her hand she gaze at the sky the street the acacia
all bath in light the pigeon flutter over a neighbor roof
and then her glanc suddenli fell upon the manuscript and she said to
herself that she must know what it contain
thi is what she read
chapter iva heart beneath a stone
illustr cosett with letter
the reduct of the univers to a singl be the expans of a
singl be even to god that is love
love is the salut of the angel to the star
how sad is the soul when it is sad through love
what a void in the absenc of the be who by herself alon fill the
world oh how true it is that the belov be becom god on could
comprehend that god might be jealou of thi had not god the father of
all evid made creation for the soul and the soul for love
the glimps of a smile beneath a white crape bonnet with a lilac
curtain is suffici to caus the soul to enter into the palac of
dream
god is behind everyth but everyth hide god thing ar black
creatur ar opaqu to love a be is to render that be
transpar
certain thought ar prayer there ar moment when whatev the
attitud of the bodi mai be the soul is on it knee
part lover beguil absenc by a thousand chimer devic which
possess howev a realiti of their own thei ar prevent from
see each other thei cannot write to each other thei discov a
multitud of mysteri mean to correspond thei send each other the
song of the bird the perfum of the flower the smile of children
the light of the sun the sigh of the breez the rai of star
all creation and why not all the work of god ar made to serv love
love is suffici potent to charg all natur with it messag
oh spring thou art a letter that i write to her
the futur belong to heart even more than it doe to mind love
that is the onli thing that can occupi and fill etern in the
infinit the inexhaust is requisit
love particip of the soul itself it is of the same natur like
it it is the divin spark like it it is incorrupt indivis
imperish it is a point of fire that exist within us which is
immort and infinit which noth can confin and which noth can
extinguish we feel it burn even to the veri marrow of our bone
and we see it beam in the veri depth of heaven
oh love ador voluptu of two mind which understand each
other of two heart which exchang with each other of two glanc
which penetr each other you will come to me will you not bliss
stroll by two in the solitud bless and radiant dai i have
sometim dream that from time to time hour detach themselv from
the live of the angel and came here below to travers the destini
of men
god can add noth to the happi of those who love except to give
them endless durat after a life of love an etern of love is in
fact an augment but to increas in intens even the ineff
felic which love bestow on the soul even in thi world is
imposs even to god god is the plenitud of heaven love is the
plenitud of man
you look at a star for two reason becaus it is lumin and becaus
it is impenetr you have besid you a sweeter radianc and a
greater mysteri woman
all of us whoever we mai be have our respir be we lack air
and we stifl then we die to die for lack of love is horribl
suffoc of the soul
when love ha fuse and mingl two be in a sacr and angel
uniti the secret of life ha been discov so far as thei ar
concern thei ar no longer anyth more than the two boundari of
the same destini thei ar no longer anyth but the two wing of the
same spirit love soar
on the dai when a woman as she pass befor you emit light as she
walk you ar lost you love but on thing remain for you to do to
think of her so intent that she is constrain to think of you
what love commenc can be finish by god alon
true love is in despair and is enchant over a glove lost or a
handkerchief found and etern is requir for it devot and it
hope it is compos both of the infinit great and the infinit
littl
if you ar a stone be adam if you ar a plant be the sensit
plant if you ar a man be love
noth suffic for love we have happi we desir paradis we
possess paradis we desir heaven
oh ye who love each other all thi is contain in love understand
how to find it there love ha contempl as well as heaven and
more than heaven it ha voluptu
doe she still come to the luxembourg no sir thi is the church
where she attend mass is it not she no longer come here doe
she still live in thi hous she ha move awai where ha she
gone to dwell
she did not sai
what a melancholi thing not to know the address of on soul
love ha it childish other passion have their petti shame
on the passion which belittl man honor to the on which make a
child of him
there is on strang thing do you know it i dwell in the night there
is a be who carri off my sky when she went awai
oh would that we were ly side by side in the same grave hand in
hand and from time to time in the dark gentli caress a
fingerthat would suffic for my etern
ye who suffer becaus ye love love yet more to die of love is to
live in it
love a sombr and starri transfigur is mingl with thi tortur
there is ecstasi in agoni
oh joi of the bird it is becaus thei have nest that thei sing
love is a celesti respir of the air of paradis
deep heart sage mind take life as god ha made it it is a long
trial an incomprehens prepar for an unknown destini thi
destini the true on begin for a man with the first step insid the
tomb then someth appear to him and he begin to distinguish the
definit the definit medit upon that word the live
perceiv the infinit the definit permit itself to be seen onli by
the dead in the meanwhil love and suffer hope and contempl woe
ala to him who shall have love onli bodi form appear
death will depriv him of all try to love soul you will find them
again
i encount in the street a veri poor young man who wa in love hi
hat wa old hi coat wa worn hi elbow were in hole water
trickl through hi shoe and the star through hi soul
what a grand thing it is to be love what a far grander thing it is to
love the heart becom heroic by dint of passion it is no longer
compos of anyth but what is pure it no longer rest on anyth
that is not elev and great an unworthi thought can no more
germin in it than a nettl on a glacier the seren and lofti soul
inaccess to vulgar passion and emot domin the cloud and
the shade of thi world it folli it li it hatr it
vaniti it miseri inhabit the blue of heaven and no longer
feel anyth but profound and subterranean shock of destini as the
crest of mountain feel the shock of earthquak
if there did not exist some on who love the sun would becom
extinct

flung upon her a hand of rai of light in these few line she felt
a passion ardent gener honest natur a sacr will an
immens sorrow and an immens despair a suffer heart an ecstasi
fulli expand what wa thi manuscript a letter a letter without
name without address without date without signatur press and
disinterest an enigma compos of truth a messag of love made to
be brought by an angel and read by a virgin an appoint made beyond
the bound of earth the lovelett of a phantom to a shade it wa an
absent on tranquil and deject who seem readi to take refug in
death and who sent to the absent love hi ladi the secret of fate
the kei of life love thi had been written with on foot in the grave
and on finger in heaven these line which had fallen on by on on
the paper were what might be call drop of soul
now from whom could these page come who could have pen them
cosett did not hesit a moment on man onli
he
dai had dawn onc more in her spirit all had reappear she felt an
unheardof joi and a profound anguish it wa he he who had written
he wa there it wa he whose arm had been thrust through that rail
while she wa forget of him he had found her again but had she
forgotten him no never she wa foolish to have thought so for a
singl moment she had alwai love him alwai ador him the fire
had been smother and had smoulder for a time but she saw all
plainli now it had but made headwai and now it had burst forth
afresh and had inflam her whole be thi notebook wa like a
spark which had fallen from that other soul into her she felt the
conflagr start up onc more
she imbu herself thoroughli with everi word of the manuscript oh

alreadi read in hi ey as she wa finish it for the third time
lieuten thodul pass the gate onc more and rattl hi spur
upon the pavement cosett wa forc to rais her ey she thought
him insipid silli stupid useless foppish displeas impertin
and extrem ugli the offic thought it hi duti to smile at her
she turn awai as in shame and indign she would gladli have
thrown someth at hi head
she fled reenter the hous and shut herself up in her chamber to
perus the manuscript onc more to learn it by heart and to dream
when she had thoroughli master it she kiss it and put it in her
bosom
all wa over cosett had fallen back into deep seraph love the
abyss of eden had yawn onc more
all dai long cosett remain in a sort of bewilder she scarc
thought her idea were in the state of a tangl skein in her brain
she could not manag to conjectur anyth she hope through a
tremor what vagu thing she dare make herself no promis and she
did not wish to refus herself anyth flash of pallor pass over
her counten and shiver ran through her frame it seem to her
at interv that she wa enter the land of chimra she said to
herself is thi realiti then she felt of the dear paper within her
bosom under her gown she press it to her heart she felt it angl
against her flesh and if jean valjean had seen her at the moment he
would have shudder in the presenc of that lumin and unknown joi
which overflow from beneath her eyelidsoh ye she thought it
is certainli he thi come from him and is for me
and she told herself that an intervent of the angel a celesti
chanc had given him back to her
oh transfigur of love oh dream that celesti chanc that
intervent of the angel wa a pellet of bread toss by on thief
to anoth thief from the charlemagn courtyard to the lion ditch

when even came jean valjean went out cosett dress herself she
arrang her hair in the most becom manner and she put on a dress

movement
fragment which had fallen from the eleph back into hi belli had
fill up the caviti so that it wa possibl to walk upon it as on a

hole a row of veri heavi stone kept thi network down to the floor
so that noth could pass under it thi grate wa noth els than
a piec of the brass screen with which aviari ar cover in
menageri gavroch bed stood as in a cage behind thi net the
whole resembl an esquimaux tent
thi trelliswork took the place of curtain
gavroch move asid the stone which fasten the net down in front

labor it cant wet us and that make it kick up a row old
watercarri that it is
thi allus to the thunder all the consequ of which gavroch
in hi charact of a philosoph of the nineteenth centuri accept
wa follow by a broad flash of lightn so dazzl that a hint of
it enter the belli of the eleph through the crack almost at the
same instant the thunder rumbl with great furi the two littl
creatur utter a shriek and start up so eagerli that the network
came near be displac but gavroch turn hi bold face to them
and took advantag of the clap of thunder to burst into a laugh
calm down children dont toppl over the edific that fine
firstclass thunder all right that no slouch of a streak of
lightn bravo for the good god deuc take it it almost as good

and he snuf out hi tini light
hardli had the light been extinguish when a peculiar trembl began
to affect the net under which the three children lai
it consist of a multitud of dull scratch which produc a metal
sound as if claw and teeth were gnaw at the copper wire thi wa
accompani by all sort of littl pierc cri
the littl fiveyearold boi on hear thi hubbub overhead and
chill with terror jog hi brother elbow but the elder brother
had alreadi shut hi peeper as gavroch had order then the littl
on who could no longer control hi terror question gavroch but
in a veri low tone and with bate breath
sir
hei said gavroch who had just close hi ey
what is that

and he laid hi head down on the mat again
the rat in fact who swarm by thousand in the carcass of the
eleph and who were the live black spot which we have alreadi
mention had been held in aw by the flame of the candl so long as
it had been light but as soon as the cavern which wa the same as
their citi had return to dark scent what the good
storytel perrault call fresh meat thei had hurl themselv in
throng on gavroch tent had climb to the top of it and had begun

still the littl on could not sleep
sir he began again
hei said gavroch

at the same time gavroch grasp the littl fellow hand across hi
brother the child press the hand close to him and felt reassur
courag and strength have these mysteri wai of commun
themselv silenc reign round them onc more the sound of their
voic had frighten off the rat at the expir of a few minut
thei came rage back but in vain the three littl fellow were fast
asleep and heard noth more
the hour of the night fled awai dark cover the vast place de la
bastil a wintri gale which mingl with the rain blew in gust
the patrol search all the doorwai allei enclosur and obscur
nook and in their search for nocturn vagabond thei pass in
silenc befor the eleph the monster erect motionless stare
openei into the shadow had the appear of dream happili over
hi good deed and shelter from heaven and from men the three poor
sleep children
in order to understand what is about to follow the reader must
rememb that at that epoch the bastil guardhous wa situat at
the other end of the squar and that what took place in the vicin
of the eleph could neither be seen nor heard by the sentinel
toward the end of that hour which immedi preced the dawn a man
turn from the rue saintantoin at a run made the circuit of the
enclosur of the column of juli and glide between the pale until
he wa underneath the belli of the eleph if ani light had
illumin that man it might have been divin from the thorough
manner in which he wa soak that he had pass the night in the rain
arriv beneath the eleph he utter a peculiar cry which did not
belong to ani human tongu and which a paroquet alon could have
imit twice he repeat thi cry of whose orthographi the
follow bare convei an idea
kirikiki
at the second cry a clear young merri voic respond from the belli
of the eleph
ye
almost immedi the plank which close the hole wa drawn asid
and gave passag to a child who descend the eleph leg and fell
briskli near the man it wa gavroch the man wa montparnass
as for hi cry of kirikikiouthat wa doubtless what the child had
meant when he said
you will ask for monsieur gavroch
on hear it he had wake with a start had crawl out of hi
alcov push apart the net a littl and carefulli draw it
togeth again then he had open the trap and descend
the man and the child recogn each other silent amid the gloom
montparnass confin himself to the remark
we need you come lend us a hand
the lad ask for no further enlighten
im with you said he
and both took their wai toward the rue saintantoin whenc
montparnass had emerg wind rapidli through the long file of
marketgarden cart which descend toward the market at that hour
the marketgarden crouch halfasleep in their wagon amid the
salad and veget envelop to their veri ey in their muffler
on account of the beat rain did not even glanc at these strang

chapter iiith vicissitud of flight
thi is what had taken place that same night at the la forc
an escap had been plan between babet brujon guelem and
thnardier although thnardier wa in close confin babet had
arrang the matter for hi own benefit on the same dai as the reader
ha seen from montparnass account to gavroch montparnass wa to
help them from outsid
brujon after have pass a month in the punish cell had had
time in the first place to weav a rope in the second to matur a
plan in former time those sever place where the disciplin of the

courtyard he wa place in the new build the first thing he found
in the new build wa guelem the second wa a nail guelem that
is to sai crime a nail that is to sai liberti brujon of whom it
is high time that the reader should have a complet idea wa with an
appear of delic health and a profoundli premedit languor a

smile from hi natur hi first studi in hi art had been direct
to roof he had made great progress in the industri of the men who
tear off lead who plunder the roof and despoil the gutter by the
process call doubl pick
the circumst which put the finish touch on the moment peculiarli
favor for an attempt at escap wa that the roofer were relai
and rejoint at that veri moment a portion of the slate on the
prison the saintbernard courtyard wa no longer absolut isol
from the charlemagn and the saintloui court up abov there were
scaffold and ladder in other word bridg and stair in the

the new build which wa the most crack and decrepit thing to be
seen anywher in the world wa the weak point in the prison the wall

thnardier had been in solitari confin in on of these cage sinc
the night of the 3d of februari no on wa ever abl to discov how

there ar in mani prison treacher employe halfjail
halfthiev who assist in escap who sell to the polic an

on that same night then when littl gavroch pick up the two lost
children brujon and guelem who knew that babet who had escap
that morn wa wait for them in the street as well as
montparnass rose softli and with the nail which brujon had found
began to pierc the chimnei against which their bed stood the rubbish
fell on brujon bed so that thei were not heard shower mingl with
thunder shook the door on their hing and creat in the prison a
terribl and opportun uproar those of the prison who woke
pretend to fall asleep again and left guelem and brujon to their
own devic brujon wa adroit guelem wa vigor befor ani sound
had reach the watcher who wa sleep in the grate cell which
open into the dormitori the wall had been pierc the chimnei

forc and the two redoubt ruffian were on the roof the wind and
rain redoubl the roof wa slipperi

an abyss six feet broad and eighti feet deep separ them from the
surround wall at the bottom of thi abyss thei could see the
musket of a sentinel gleam through the gloom thei fasten on end
of the rope which brujon had spun in hi dungeon to the stump of the
iron bar which thei had just wrench off flung the other over the
outer wall cross the abyss at on bound clung to the cope of the
wall got astrid of it let themselv slip on after the other
along the rope upon a littl roof which touch the bathhous pull
their rope after them jump down into the courtyard of the
bathhous travers it push open the porter wicket besid which
hung hi rope pull thi open the portecochr and found
themselv in the street
threequart of an hour had not elaps sinc thei had risen in bed
in the dark nail in hand and their project in their head
a few moment later thei had join babet and montparnass who were
prowl about the neighborhood
thei had broken their rope in pull it after them and a bit of it
remain attach to the chimnei on the roof thei had sustain no
other damag howev than that of scratch nearli all the skin off
their hand
that night thnardier wa warn without ani on be abl to
explain how and wa not asleep
toward on oclock in the morn the night be veri dark he saw
two shadow pass along the roof in the rain and squall in front of
the dormerwindow which wa opposit hi cage on halt at the
window long enough to dart in a glanc thi wa brujon
thnardier recogn him and understood thi wa enough
thnardier rate as a burglar and detain as a measur of precaut
under the charg of organ a nocturn ambush with arm forc
wa kept in sight the sentri who wa reliev everi two hour
march up and down in front of hi cage with load musket the
fineair wa light by a skylight the prison had on hi feet
fetter weigh fifti pound everi dai at four oclock in the
afternoon a jailer escort by two dogsthi wa still in vogu at
that timeent hi cage deposit besid hi bed a loaf of black
bread weigh two pound a jug of water a bowl fill with rather
thin bouillon in which swam a few mayagan bean inspect hi iron
and tap the bar thi man and hi dog made two visit dure the
night
thnardier had obtain permiss to keep a sort of iron bolt which he
us to spike hi bread into a crack in the wall in order to preserv
it from the rat as he said as thnardier wa kept in sight no
object had been made to thi spike still it wa rememb
afterward that on of the jailer had said it would be better to
let him have onli a wooden spike
at two oclock in the morn the sentinel who wa an old soldier
wa reliev and replac by a conscript a few moment later the man
with the dog paid hi visit and went off without notic anyth
except possibl the excess youth and the rustic air of the raw
recruit two hour afterward at four oclock when thei came to
reliev the conscript he wa found asleep on the floor ly like a
log near thnardier cage as for thnardier he wa no longer there
there wa a hole in the ceil of hi cage and abov it anoth
hole in the roof on of the plank of hi bed had been wrench off
and probabl carri awai with him as it wa not found thei also
seiz in hi cell a halfempti bottl which contain the remain of
the stupefi wine with which the soldier had been drug the
soldier bayonet had disappear
at the moment when thi discoveri wa made it wa assum that
thnardier wa out of reach the truth is that he wa no longer in the
new build but that he wa still in great danger
thnardier on reach the roof of the new build had found the
remain of brujon rope hang to the bar of the upper trap of the
chimnei but as thi broken fragment wa much too short he had not
been abl to escap by the outer wall as brujon and guelem had done
when on turn from the rue de ballet into the rue du roidesicil
on almost immedi encount a repuls ruin there stood on that
spot in the last centuri a hous of which onli the back wall now
remain a regular wall of masonri which rise to the height of the
third stori between the adjoin build thi ruin can be
recogn by two larg squar window which ar still to be seen
there the middl on that nearest the right gabl is bar with a
wormeaten beam adjust like a prop through these window there wa
formerli visibl a lofti and lugubri wall which wa a fragment of
the outer wall of la forc
the empti space on the street left by the demolish hous is
halffil by a fenc of rotten board shore up by five stone post
in thi recess li conceal a littl shanti which lean against the
portion of the ruin which ha remain stand the fenc ha a gate
which a few year ago wa fasten onli by a latch
it wa the crest of thi ruin that thnardier had succeed in
reach a littl after on oclock in the morn
how had he got there that is what no on ha ever been abl to explain
or understand the lightn must at the same time have hinder and
help him had he made us of the ladder and scaffold of the
slater to get from roof to roof from enclosur to enclosur from
compart to compart to the build of the charlemagn court
then to the build of the saintloui court to the outer wall and
thenc to the hut on the rue du roidesicil but in that itinerari
there exist break which seem to render it an imposs had he
place the plank from hi bed like a bridg from the roof of the
fineair to the outer wall and crawl flat on hi belli on the
cope of the outer wall the whole distanc round the prison as far as
the hut but the outer wall of la forc form a crenel and
unequ line it mount and descend it drop at the firemen
barrack it rose toward the bathhous it wa cut in twain by
build it wa not even of the same height on the hotel lamoignon as
on the rue pave everywher occur fall and right angl and then
the sentinel must have espi the dark form of the fugit henc
the rout taken by thnardier still remain rather inexplic in two
manner flight wa imposs had thnardier spur on by that
thirst for liberti which chang precipic into ditch iron bar
into wattl of osier a legless man into an athlet a gouti man into
a bird stupid into instinct instinct into intellig and
intellig into geniu had thnardier invent a third mode no on
ha ever found out
the marvel of escap cannot alwai be account for the man who make
hi escap we repeat is inspir there is someth of the star and
of the lightn in the mysteri gleam of flight the effort toward
deliver is no less surpris than the flight toward the sublim
and on sai of the escap thief how did he contriv to scale that
wall in the same wai that on sai of corneil where did he find
the mean of dy
at all event drip with perspir drench with rain with hi
cloth hang in ribbon hi hand flai hi elbow bleed hi
knee torn thnardier had reach what children in their figur
languag call the edg of the wall of the ruin there he had
stretch himself out at full length and there hi strength had fail
him a steep escarp three stori high separ him from the
pavement of the street
the rope which he had wa too short
there he wait pale exhaust desper with all the despair which
he had undergon still hidden by the night but tell himself that
the dai wa on the point of dawn alarm at the idea of hear the
neighbor clock of saintpaul strike four within a few minut an
hour when the sentinel wa reliev and when the latter would be found
asleep under the pierc roof stare in horror at a terribl depth
at the light of the street lantern the wet black pavement that
pavement long for yet fright which meant death and which meant
liberti
he ask himself whether hi three accomplic in flight had succeed
if thei had heard him and if thei would come to hi assist he
listen with the except of the patrol no on had pass through
the street sinc he had been there nearli the whole of the descent of
the marketgarden from montreuil from charonn from vincenn and
from berci to the market wa accomplish through the rue
saintantoin
four oclock struck thnardier shudder a few moment later that
terrifi and confus uproar which follow the discoveri of an escap
broke forth in the prison the sound of door open and shut the
creak of grate on their hing a tumult in the guardhous the
hoars shout of the turnkei the shock of musketbutt on the
pavement of the court reach hi ear light ascend and descend
past the grate window of the dormitori a torch ran along the
ridgepol of the top stori of the new build the firemen belong
in the barrack on the right had been summon their helmet which
the torch light up in the rain went and came along the roof at the
same time thnardier perceiv in the direct of the bastil a wan
white light up the edg of the sky in dole wise
he wa on top of a wall ten inch wide stretch out under the heavi
rain with two gulf to right and left unabl to stir subject to the
giddi of a possibl fall and to the horror of a certain arrest
and hi thought like the pendulum of a clock swung from on of these
idea to the other dead if i fall caught if i stai in the midst of
thi anguish he suddenli saw the street be still dark a man who
wa glide along the wall and come from the rue pave halt in the
recess abov which thnardier wa as it were suspend here thi man
wa join by a second who walk with the same caution then by a
third then by a fourth when these men were reunit on of them
lift the latch of the gate in the fenc and all four enter the
enclosur in which the shanti stood thei halt directli under
thnardier these men had evid chosen thi vacant space in order
that thei might consult without be seen by the passersbi or by the
sentinel who guard the wicket of la forc a few pace distant it must
be ad that the rain kept thi sentinel block in hi box
thnardier not be abl to distinguish their visag lent an ear to
their word with the desper attent of a wretch who feel himself
lost
thnardier saw someth resembl a gleam of hope flash befor hi
eyesthes men convers in slang
the first said in a low but distinct voic
let cut what ar we up to here
the second repli it rain hard enough to put out the veri
devil fire and the bobbi will be along instant there a

about the nocturn adventur in the hovel about thnardier about the

mariu had momentarili forgotten all thi in the even he did not
even know that there had been a morn what he had done where he had

into each other arm without perceiv that their lip met while
their uplift ey overflow with raptur and full of tear gaze
upon the star
when mariu went forth the street wa desert thi wa the moment
when ponin wa follow the ruffian to the boulevard
while mariu had been dream with hi head press to the tree an
idea had cross hi mind an idea ala that he himself judg to be
senseless and imposs he had come to a desper decis
chapter viith old heart and the young heart in the presenc of each
other
at that epoch father gillenormand wa well past hi ninetyfirst
birthdai he still live with mademoisel gillenormand in the rue de
fillesducalvair no 6 in the old hous which he own he wa as
the reader will rememb on of those antiqu old men who await death
perfectli erect whom ag bear down without bend and whom even
sorrow cannot curv
still hi daughter had been sai for some time my father is
sink he no longer box the maid ear he no longer thump the
landingplac so vigor with hi cane when basqu wa slow in
open the door the revolut of juli had exasper him for the
space of bare six month he had view almost tranquilli that
coupl of word in the moniteur m humblotcont peer of franc
the fact is that the old man wa deepli deject he did not bend he
did not yield thi wa no more a characterist of hi physic than
of hi moral natur but he felt himself give wai intern for
four year he had been wait for mariu with hi foot firmli
plant that is the exact word in the convict that that
goodfornoth young scamp would ring at hi door some dai or other
now he had reach the point where at certain gloomi hour he said
to himself that if mariu made him wait much longerit wa not death
that wa insupport to him it wa the idea that perhap he should
never see mariu again the idea of never see mariu again had never
enter hi brain until that dai now the thought began to recur to
him and it chill him absenc as is alwai the case in genuin and
natur sentiment had onli serv to augment the grandfath love
for the ungrat child who had gone off like a flash it is dure
decemb night when the cold stand at ten degre that on think
oftenest of the son
m gillenormand wa or thought himself abov all thing incap of
take a singl step heth grandfath toward hi grandson i
would die rather he said to himself he did not consid himself as
the least to blame but he thought of mariu onli with profound
tender and the mute despair of an elderli kindli old man who is
about to vanish in the dark
he began to lose hi teeth which ad to hi sad
m gillenormand without howev acknowledg it to himself for it
would have render him furiou and asham had never love a mistress
as he love mariu
he had had place in hi chamber opposit the head of hi bed so that
it should be the first thing on which hi ey fell on wake an old
portrait of hi other daughter who wa dead madam pontmerci a
portrait which had been taken when she wa eighteen he gaze
incessantli at that portrait on dai he happen to sai as he gaze
upon it
i think the like is strong
to my sister inquir mademoisel gillenormand ye certainli
the old man ad
and to him also
onc as he sat with hi knee press togeth and hi ey almost
close in a despond attitud hi daughter ventur to sai to him
father ar you as angri with him as ever
she paus not dare to proce further
with whom he demand
with that poor mariu
he rais hi ag head laid hi wither and emaci fist on the

scoundrel a vain littl ingrat a heartless soulless haughti and
wick man
and he turn awai so that hi daughter might not see the tear that
stood in hi ey
three dai later he broke a silenc which had last four hour to sai
to hi daughter pointblank
i had the honor to ask mademoisel gillenormand never to mention him

aunt gillenormand renounc everi effort and pronounc thi acut
diagnosi my father never care veri much for my sister after her

gillenormand had fail in her attempt to substitut her favorit the
offic of lancer for mariu the substitut thodul had not been
a success m gillenormand had not accept the quid pro quo a
vacanc in the heart doe not accommod itself to a stopgap
thodul on hi side though he scent the inherit wa disgust
at the task of pleas the goodman bore the lancer and the lancer
shock the goodman lieuten thodul wa gai no doubt but a
chatterbox frivol but vulgar a high liver but a frequent of
bad compani he had mistress it is true and he had a great deal to
sai about them it is true also but he talk badli all hi good
qualiti had a defect m gillenormand wa worn out with hear him
tell about the love affair that he had in the vicin of the barrack

jean valjean had made up hi mind to quit pari and even franc and
go over to england
he had warn cosett he wish to set out befor the end of the week
he had seat himself on the slope in the champdemar turn over

if we ar to believ certain oracl of crafti polit view a

revolt strengthen those govern which it doe not overthrow it
put the armi to the test it consecr the bourgeoisi it draw out

it ha been calcul that the first dai of a riot cost franc twenti

cost on hundr and twenti million that is to sai if onli the

for our part we reject thi word upris as too larg and

whether an upris cost as much as a battl why a battl in the
first place here the question of war come up is war less of a

father hucheloup had possibl been born a chemist but the fact is
that he wa a cook peopl did not confin themselv to drink alon

the journal of the dai which said that that nearli impregn
structur of the barricad of the rue de la chanvreri as thei call
it reach to the level of the first floor were mistaken the fact
is that it did not exce an averag height of six or seven feet it
wa built in such a manner that the combat could at their will
either disappear behind it or domin the barrier and even scale it
crest by mean of a quadrupl row of pavingston place on top of
each other and arrang as step in the interior on the outsid the
front of the barricad compos of pile of pavingston and cask
bound togeth by beam and plank which were entangl in the wheel
of anceau drai and of the overturn omnibu had a bristl and
inextric aspect
an apertur larg enough to allow a man to pass through had been made
between the wall of the hous and the extrem of the barricad which
wa furthest from the wineshop so that an exit wa possibl at thi
point the pole of the omnibu wa place upright and held up with
rope and a red flag fasten to thi pole float over the
barricad
the littl mondtour barricad hidden behind the wineshop build
wa not visibl the two barricad unit form a verit redoubt
enjolra and courfeyrac had not thought fit to barricad the other
fragment of the rue mondtour which open through the rue de prcheur
an issu into the hall wish no doubt to preserv a possibl
commun with the outsid and not entertain much fear of an
attack through the danger and difficult street of the rue de
prcheur
with the except of thi issu which wa left free and which
constitut what folard in hi strateg style would have term a
branch and take into account also the narrow cut arrang on
the rue de la chanvreri the interior of the barricad where the
wineshop form a salient angl present an irregular squar close
on all side there exist an interv of twenti pace between the
grand barrier and the lofti hous which form the background of the
street so that on might sai that the barricad rest on these
hous all inhabit but close from top to bottom
all thi work wa perform without ani hindranc in less than an
hour and without thi hand of bold men see a singl bearskin
cap or a singl bayonet make their appear the veri bourgeoi who
still ventur at thi hour of riot to enter the rue saintdeni cast a
glanc at the rue de la chanvreri caught sight of the barricad and
redoubl their pace
the two barricad be finish and the flag run up a tabl wa
drag out of the wineshop and courfeyrac mount on the tabl
enjolra brought the squar coffer and courfeyrac open it thi
coffer wa fill with cartridg when the mob saw the cartridg a
tremor ran through the bravest and a momentari silenc ensu
courfeyrac distribut them with a smile
each on receiv thirti cartridg mani had powder and set about
make other with the bullet which thei had run as for the barrel of
powder it stood on a tabl on on side near the door and wa held in
reserv
the alarm beat which ran through all pari did not ceas but it had
final come to be noth more than a monoton nois to which thei
no longer paid ani attent thi nois retreat at time and again
drew near with melancholi undul
thei load the gun and carbin all togeth without hast with
solemn graviti enjolra went and station three sentinel outsid the

chapter viiimani interrog point with regard to a certain le
cabuc whose name mai not have been le cabuc
the tragic pictur which we have undertaken would not be complet the
reader would not see those grand moment of social birthpang in a
revolutionari birth which contain convuls mingl with effort in
their exact and real relief were we to omit in the sketch here
outlin an incid full of epic and savag horror which occur
almost immedi after gavroch departur
mob as the reader know ar like a snowbal and collect as thei
roll along a throng of tumultu men these men do not ask each other
whenc thei come among the passersbi who had join the rabbl led by
enjolra combeferr and courfeyrac there had been a person wear
the jacket of a street porter which wa veri threadbar on the
shoulder who gesticul and vocifer and who had the look of a
drunken savag thi man whose name or nicknam wa le cabuc and who
wa moreov an utter stranger to those who pretend to know him
wa veri drunk or assum the appear of be so and had seat
himself with sever other at a tabl which thei had drag outsid
of the wineshop thi cabuc while make those who vi with him
drunk seem to be examin with a thought air the larg hous at
the extrem of the barricad whose five stori command the whole
street and face the rue saintdeni all at onc he exclaim
do you know comrad it is from that hous yonder that we must fire
when we ar at the window the deuc is in it if ani on can advanc
into the street
ye but the hous is close said on of the drinker
let us knock
thei will not open
let us break in the door
le cabuc run to the door which had a veri massiv knocker and
knock the door open not he strike a second blow no on answer a
third stroke the same silenc
is there ani on here shout cabuc
noth stir
then he seiz a gun and begin to batter the door with the butt end
it wa an ancient allei door low vault narrow solid entir of
oak line on the insid with a sheet of iron and iron stai a genuin
prison postern the blow from the butt end of the gun made the hous
trembl but did not shake the door
nevertheless it is probabl that the inhabit were disturb for a
tini squar window wa final seen to open on the third stori and at
thi apertur appear the reverend and terrifi face of a grayhair
old man who wa the porter and who held a candl
the man who wa knock paus
gentlemen said the porter what do you want
open said cabuc
that cannot be gentlemen
open nevertheless
imposs gentlemen
le cabuc took hi gun and aim at the porter but as he wa below and
as it wa veri dark the porter did not see him
will you open ye or no
no gentlemen
do you sai no
i sai no my goo
the porter did not finish the shot wa fire the ball enter under
hi chin and came out at the nape of hi neck after travers the
jugular vein
the old man fell back without a sigh the candl fell and wa
extinguish and noth more wa to be seen except a motionless head
ly on the sill of the small window and a littl whitish smoke which
float off toward the roof
there said le cabuc drop the butt end of hi gun to the
pavement
he had hardli utter thi word when he felt a hand laid on hi
shoulder with the weight of an eagl talon and he heard a voic
sai to him
on your knee
the murder turn round and saw befor him enjolra cold white
face
enjolra held a pistol in hi hand
he had hasten up at the sound of the discharg
he had seiz cabuc collar blous shirt and suspend with hi
left hand
on your knee he repeat
and with an imperi motion the frail young man of twenti year bent
the thickset and sturdi porter like a reed and brought him to hi
knee in the mire
le cabuc attempt to resist but he seem to have been seiz by a
superhuman hand
enjolra pale with bare neck and dishevel hair and hi woman
face had about him at that moment someth of the antiqu themi hi
dilat nostril hi downcast ey gave to hi implac greek
profil that express of wrath and that express of chastiti which
as the ancient world view the matter befit justic
the whole barricad hasten up then all rang themselv in a circl
at a distanc feel that it wa imposs to utter a word in the
presenc of the thing which thei were about to behold
le cabuc vanquish no longer tri to struggl and trembl in
everi limb
enjolra releas him and drew out hi watch
collect yourself said he think or prai you have on minut
merci murmur the murder then he drop hi head and stammer
a few inarticul oath
enjolra never took hi ey off of him he allow a minut to pass
then he replac hi watch in hi fob that done he grasp le cabuc
by the hair as the latter coil himself into a ball at hi knee and
shriek and place the muzzl of the pistol to hi ear mani of those
intrepid men who had so tranquilli enter upon the most terribl of
adventur turn asid their head
an explos wa heard the assassin fell to the pavement face
downward
enjolra straighten himself up and cast a convinc and sever
glanc around him then he spurn the corps with hi foot and said
throw that outsid
three men rais the bodi of the unhappi wretch which wa still
agit by the last mechan convuls of the life that had fled
and flung it over the littl barricad into the rue mondtour
enjolra wa thought it is imposs to sai what grandios shadow
slowli spread over hi redoubt seren all at onc he rais hi
voic
a silenc fell upon them
citizen said enjolra what that man did is fright what i have
done is horribl he kill therefor i kill him i had to do it
becaus insurrect must have it disciplin assassin is even
more of a crime here than elsewher we ar under the ey of the
revolut we ar the priest of the republ we ar the victim of
duti and must not be possibl to slander our combat i have
therefor tri that man and condemn him to death as for myself
constrain as i am to do what i have done and yet abhor it i
have judg myself also and you shall soon see to what i have
condemn myself
those who listen to him shudder
we will share thy fate cri combeferr
so be it repli enjolra on word more in execut thi man i
have obei necess but necess is a monster of the old world
necess name is fatal now the law of progress is that
monster shall disappear befor the angel and that fatal shall
vanish befor fratern it is a bad moment to pronounc the word
love no matter i do pronounc it and i glorifi it love the futur
is thine death i make us of thee but i hate thee citizen in the
futur there will be neither dark nor thunderbolt neither
feroci ignor nor bloodi retali as there will be no more
satan there will be no more michael in the futur no on will kill
ani on els the earth will beam with radianc the human race will
love the dai will come citizen when all will be concord harmoni
light joi and life it will come and it is in order that it mai come
that we ar about to die
enjolra ceas hi virgin lip close and he remain for some time
stand on the spot where he had shed blood in marbl immobl hi
stare ey caus those about him to speak in low tone
jean prouvair and combeferr press each other hand silent and
lean against each other in an angl of the barricad thei watch
with an admir in which there wa some compass that grave young
man execution and priest compos of light like crystal and also
of rock
let us sai at onc that later on after the action when the bodi
were taken to the morgu and search a polic agent card wa found
on le cabuc the author of thi book had in hi hand in 1848 the
special report on thi subject made to the prefect of polic in 1832
we will add that if we ar to believ a tradit of the polic which
is strang but probabl well found le cabuc wa claques the fact
is that date from the death of le cabuc there wa no longer ani
question of claques claques had nowher left ani trace of hi

a be who could have hover over pari that night with the wing of
the bat or the owl would have had beneath hi ey a gloomi spectacl
all that old quarter of the hall which is like a citi within a citi
through which run the rue saintdeni and saintmartin where a
thousand lane cross and of which the insurg had made their
redoubt and their stronghold would have appear to him like a dark
and enorm caviti hollow out in the centr of pari there the
glanc fell into an abyss thank to the broken lantern thank to the
close window there all radianc all life all sound all movement
ceas the invis polic of the insurrect were on the watch
everywher and maintain order that is to sai night the necessari
tactic of insurrect ar to drown small number in a vast obscur
to multipli everi combat by the possibl which that obscur
contain at dusk everi window where a candl wa burn receiv a
shot the light wa extinguish sometim the inhabit wa kill
henc noth wa stir there wa noth but fright mourn
stupor in the hous and in the street a sort of sacr horror not
even the long row of window and store the indent of the
chimnei and the roof and the vagu reflect which ar cast back
by the wet and muddi pavement were visibl an ey cast upward at
that mass of shadow might perhap have caught a glimps here and
there at interv of indistinct gleam which brought out broken and
eccentr line and profil of singular build someth like the
light which go and come in ruin it wa at such point that the
barricad were situat the rest wa a lake of obscur foggi
heavi and funer abov which in motionless and melancholi
outlin rose the tower of saintjacqu the church of saintmerri
and two or three more of those grand edific of which man make giant
and the night make phantom
all around thi desert and disquiet labyrinth in the quarter
where the parisian circul had not been annihil and where a
few street lantern still burn the aerial observ might have
distinguish the metal gleam of sword and bayonet the dull
rumbl of artilleri and the swarm of silent battalion whose rank
were swell from minut to minut a formid girdl which wa
slowli draw in and around the insurrect
the invest quarter wa no longer anyth more than a monstrou
cavern everyth there appear to be asleep or motionless and as
we have just seen ani street which on might come to offer noth
but dark
a wild dark full of trap full of unseen and formid shock
into which it wa alarm to penetr and in which it wa terribl
to remain where those who enter shiver befor those whom thei
await where those who wait shudder befor those who were come
invis combat were entrench at everi corner of the street
snare of the sepulchr conceal in the densiti of night all wa
over no more light wa to be hope for henceforth except the
lightn of gun no further encount except the abrupt and rapid
apparit of death where how when no on knew but it wa certain
and inevit in thi place which had been mark out for the
struggl the govern and the insurrect the nation guard and
popular societi the bourgeoi and the upris grope their wai
were about to come into contact the necess wa the same for both
the onli possibl issu thenceforth wa to emerg thenc kill or
conqueror a situat so extrem an obscur so power that the
most timid felt themselv seiz with resolut and the most dare
with terror
moreov on both side the furi the rage and the determin were
equal for the on parti to advanc meant death and no on dream of
retreat for the other to remain meant death and no on dream of
flight
it wa indispens that all should be end on the follow dai
that triumph should rest either here or there that the insurrect
should prove itself a revolut or a skirmish the govern
understood thi as well as the parti the most insignific
bourgeoi felt it henc a thought of anguish which mingl with the
impenetr gloom of thi quarter where all wa at the point of be
decid henc a redoubl anxieti around that silenc whenc a
catastroph wa on the point of emerg here onli on sound wa
audibl a sound as heartrend as the death rattl as menac as a
maledict the tocsin of saintmerri noth could be more
bloodcurdl than the clamor of that wild and desper bell wail
amid the shadow
as it often happen natur seem to have fallen into accord with what
men were about to do noth disturb the harmoni of the whole
effect the star had disappear heavi cloud fill the horizon with
their melancholi fold a black sky rest on these dead street as

tomb
while a battl that wa still wholli polit wa in prepar in
the same local which had alreadi wit so mani revolutionari
event while youth the secret associ the school in the name
of principl and the middl class in the name of interest were
approach preparatori to dash themselv togeth clasp and

quarter in the most profound depth of the unfathom caviti of
that wretch old pari which disappear under the splendor of happi

utter to a dull roar
a fear and sacr voic which is compos of the roar of the brute
and of the word of god which terrifi the weak and which warn the

chapter iiith extrem edg
mariu had reach the hall
there everyth wa still calmer more obscur and more motionless
than in the neighbor street on would have said that the glacial
peac of the sepulchr had sprung forth from the earth and had spread
over the heaven
nevertheless a red glow brought out against thi black background the
lofti roof of the hous which bar the rue de la chanvreri on the
sainteustach side it wa the reflect of the torch which wa
burn in the corinth barricad mariu direct hi step toward
that red light it had drawn him to the marchauxpoir and he
caught a glimps of the dark mouth of the rue de prcheur he enter
it the insurg sentinel who wa guard the other end did not
see him he felt that he wa veri close to that which he had come in
search of and he walk on tipto in thi manner he reach the elbow
of that short section of the rue mondtour which wa as the reader
will rememb the onli commun which enjolra had preserv with
the outsid world at the corner of the last hous on hi left he
thrust hi head forward and look into the fragment of the rue
mondtour
a littl beyond the angl of the lane and the rue de la chanvreri
which cast a broad curtain of shadow in which he wa himself engulf
he perceiv some light on the pavement a bit of the wineshop and
beyond a flicker lamp within a sort of shapeless wall and men
crouch down with gun on their knee all thi wa ten fathom
distant from him it wa the interior of the barricad
the hous which border the lane on the right conceal the rest of
the wineshop the larg barricad and the flag from him
mariu had but a step more to take
then the unhappi young man seat himself on a post fold hi arm
and fell to think about hi father
he thought of that heroic colonel pontmerci who had been so proud a
soldier who had guard the frontier of franc under the republ and
had touch the frontier of asia under napoleon who had beheld genoa
alexandria milan turin madrid vienna dresden berlin moscow who
had left on all the victori battlefield of europ drop of that
same blood which he mariu had in hi vein who had grown grai
befor hi time in disciplin and command who had live with hi
swordbelt buckl hi epaulet fall on hi breast hi cockad
blacken with powder hi brow furrow with hi helmet in barrack
in camp in the bivouac in ambul and who at the expir of
twenti year had return from the great war with a scar cheek a
smile counten tranquil admir pure as a child have done
everyth for franc and noth against her
he said to himself that hi dai had also come now that hi hour had
struck that follow hi father he too wa about to show himself
brave intrepid bold to run to meet the bullet to offer hi breast
to bayonet to shed hi blood to seek the enemi to seek death that
he wa about to wage war in hi turn and descend to the field of
battl and that the field of battl upon which he wa to descend wa
the street and that the war in which he wa about to engag wa civil
war
he beheld civil war laid open like a gulf befor him and into thi he
wa about to fall then he shudder
he thought of hi father sword which hi grandfath had sold to a
secondhand dealer and which he had so mournfulli regret he said
to himself that that chast and valiant sword had done well to escap
from him and to depart in wrath into the gloom that if it had thu
fled it wa becaus it wa intellig and becaus it had foreseen the
futur that it had had a presenti of thi rebellion the war of
the gutter the war of the pavement fusillad through
cellarwindow blow given and receiv in the rear it wa becaus
come from marengo and friedland it did not wish to go to the rue de
la chanvreri it wa becaus after what it had done with the father
it did not wish to do thi for the son he told himself that if that
sword were there if after take possess of it at hi father
pillow he had dare to take it and carri it off for thi combat of
dark between frenchmen in the street it would assuredli have
scorch hi hand and burst out aflam befor hi ey like the sword
of the angel he told himself that it wa fortun that it wa not
there and that it had disappear that that wa well that that wa
just that hi grandfath had been the true guardian of hi father
glori and that it wa far better that the colonel sword should be
sold at auction sold to the oldcloth man thrown among the old
junk than that it should todai wound the side of hi countri
and then he fell to weep bitterli
thi wa horribl but what wa he to do live without cosett he could
not sinc she wa gone he must need die had he not given her hi
word of honor that he would die she had gone know that thi meant
that it pleas her that mariu should die and then it wa clear that
she no longer love him sinc she had depart thu without warn
without a word without a letter although she knew hi address what
wa the good of live and why should he live now and then what
should he retreat after go so far should he flee from danger after
have approach it should he slip awai after have come and peep
into the barricad slip awai all in a trembl sai after all i
have had enough of it as it is i have seen it that suffic thi is
civil war and i shall take my leav should he abandon hi friend
who were expect him who were in need of him possibl who were a
mere hand against an armi should he be untru at onc to hi love
to countri to hi word should he give to hi cowardic the pretext of
patriot but thi wa imposs and if the phantom of hi father
wa there in the gloom and beheld him retreat he would beat him on
the loin with the flat of hi sword and shout to him march on you
poltroon
thu a prei to the conflict movement of hi thought he drop
hi head
all at onc he rais it a sort of splendid rectif had just
been effect in hi mind there is a widen of the sphere of thought
which is peculiar to the vicin of the grave it make on see
clearli to be near death the vision of the action into which he felt
that he wa perhap on the point of enter appear to him no more
as lament but as superb the war of the street wa suddenli
transfigur by some unfathom inward work of hi soul befor
the ey of hi thought all the tumultu interrog point of
reveri recur to him in throng but without troubl him he left
none of them unansw
let us see why should hi father be indign ar there not case
where insurrect rise to the digniti of duti what wa there that
wa degrad for the son of colonel pontmerci in the combat which wa
about to begin it is no longer montmirail nor champaubert it is
someth quit differ the question is no longer on of sacr
territorybut of a holi idea the countri wail that mai be but
human applaud but is it true that the countri doe wail franc
bleed but liberti smile and in the presenc of liberti smile
franc forget her wound and then if we look at thing from a still
more lofti point of view why do we speak of civil war
civil warwhat doe that mean is there a foreign war is not all war
between men war between brother war is qualifi onli by it object
there is no such thing as foreign or civil war there is onli just and
unjust war until that dai when the grand human agreement is conclud
war that at least which is the effort of the futur which is
hasten on against the past which is lag in the rear mai be
necessari what have we to reproach that war with war doe not becom
a disgrac the sword doe not becom a disgrac except when it is
us for assassin the right progress reason civil
truth then war whether foreign or civil is iniquit it is call
crime outsid the pale of that holi thing justic by what right doe

which fill the entrench enclosur to glide along the barricad as
far as that cage of pavingston where the torch wa fix to tear it
from the torch to replac it by the barrel of powder to thrust the

reform man had yield up hi liberti risk hi head lost
everyth suffer everyth and he had remain disinterest and
stoical to such a point that he might have been thought to be absent
from himself like a martyr hi conscienc inur to everi assault of
destini might have appear to be forev impregn well ani on
who had beheld hi spiritu self would have been oblig to conced
that it weaken at that moment it wa becaus of all the tortur
which he had undergon in the cours of thi long inquisit to which
destini had doom him thi wa the most terribl never had such
pincer seiz him hitherto he felt the mysteri stir of all hi
latent sensibl he felt the pluck at the strang chord ala
the suprem trial let us sai rather the onli trial is the loss of
the belov be
poor old jean valjean certainli did not love cosett otherwis than as
a father but we have alreadi remark abov that into thi patern
the widowhood of hi life had introduc all the shade of love he
love cosett as hi daughter and he love her as hi mother and he
love her as hi sister and as he had never had either a woman to
love or a wife as natur is a creditor who accept no protest that
sentiment also the most imposs to lose wa mingl with the rest
vagu ignor pure with the puriti of blind unconsci
celesti angel divin less like a sentiment than like an
instinct less like an instinct than like an impercept and
invis but real attract and love properli speak wa in hi
immens tender for cosett like the thread of gold in the
mountain conceal and virgin
let the reader recal the situat of heart which we have alreadi
indic no marriag wa possibl between them not even that of
soul and yet it is certain that their destini were wed with
the except of cosett that is to sai with the except of a
childhood jean valjean had never in the whole of hi long life known
anyth of that which mai be love the passion and love which
succe each other had not produc in him those success green
growth tender green or dark green which can be seen in foliag which
pass through the winter and in men who pass fifti in short and we
have insist on it more than onc all thi interior fusion all thi
whole of which the sum total wa a lofti virtu end in render
jean valjean a father to cosett a strang father forg from the
grandfath the son the brother and the husband that exist in
jean valjean a father in whom there wa includ even a mother a
father who love cosett and ador her and who held that child as hi
light hi home hi famili hi countri hi paradis
thu when he saw that the end had absolut come that she wa
escap from him that she wa slip from hi hand that she wa
glide from him like a cloud like water when he had befor hi ey
thi crush proof anoth is the goal of her heart anoth is the
wish of her life there is a dearest on i am no longer anyth but
her father i no longer exist when he could no longer doubt when he
said to himself she is go awai from me the grief which he felt
surpass the bound of possibl to have done all that he had done
for the purpos of end like thi and the veri idea of be
noth then as we have just said a quiver of revolt ran through him
from head to foot he felt even in the veri root of hi hair the
immens reawaken of egot and the i in thi man abyss howl
there is such a thing as the sudden give wai of the inward subsoil a
despair certainti doe not make it wai into a man without thrust
asid and break certain profound element which in some case ar
the veri man himself grief when it attain thi shape is a headlong
flight of all the forc of the conscienc these ar fatal crise few
among us emerg from them still like ourselv and firm in duti when
the limit of endur is overstep the most imperturb virtu is
disconcert jean valjean took the blotter again and convinc
himself afresh he remain bow and as though petrifi and with
stare ey over those four unobjection line and there aros
within him such a cloud that on might have thought that everyth in
thi soul wa crumbl awai
he examin thi revel athwart the exagger of reveri with
an appar and terrifi calm for it is a fear thing when a
man calm reach the cold of the statu
he measur the terribl step which hi destini had taken without hi
have a suspicion of the fact he recal hi fear of the preced
summer so foolishli dissip he recogn the precipic it wa
still the same onli jean valjean wa no longer on the brink he wa
at the bottom of it
the unpreced and heartrend thing about it wa that he had
fallen without perceiv it all the light of hi life had depart
while he still fanci that he beheld the sun
hi instinct did not hesit he put togeth certain circumst
certain date certain blush and certain pallor on cosett part
and he said to himself it is he
the divin of despair is a sort of mysteri bow which never
miss it aim he struck mariu with hi first conjectur he did not
know the name but he found the man instantli he distinctli perceiv
in the background of the implac conjur of hi memori the
unknown prowler of the luxembourg that wretch seeker of love
adventur that idler of romanc that idiot that coward for it is
cowardli to come and make ey at young girl who have besid them a
father who love them
after he had thoroughli verifi the fact that thi young man wa at
the bottom of thi situat and that everyth proceed from that
quarter he jean valjean the regener man the man who had so
labor over hi soul the man who had made so mani effort to resolv
all life all miseri and all unhappi into love look into hi
own breast and there beheld a spectr hate
great grief contain someth of deject thei discourag on with
exist the man into whom thei enter feel someth within him
withdraw from him in hi youth their visit ar lugubri later on
thei ar sinist ala if despair is a fear thing when the blood
is hot when the hair is black when the head is erect on the bodi like
the flame on the torch when the roll of destini still retain it full
thick when the heart full of desir love still possess
beat which can be return to it when on ha time for redress when
all women and all smile and all the futur and all the horizon ar
befor on when the forc of life is complet what is it in old ag
when the year hasten on grow ever paler to that twilight hour
when on begin to behold the star of the tomb
while he wa medit toussaint enter jean valjean rose and ask
her

return home hardli saw him each on for himself in time of peril
the lamplight came as usual to light the lantern which wa situat
precis opposit the door of no 7 and then went awai jean valjean
would not have appear like a live man to ani on who had examin
him in that shadow he sat there on the post of hi door motionless as
a form of ic there is congeal in despair the alarm bell and a
vagu and stormi uproar were audibl in the midst of all these
convuls of the bell mingl with the revolt the clock of
saintpaul struck eleven grave and without hast for the tocsin is
man the hour is god the passag of the hour produc no effect on
jean valjean jean valjean did not stir still at about that moment a
brusqu report burst forth in the direct of the hall a second yet
more violent follow it wa probabl that attack on the barricad in
the rue de la chanvreri which we have just seen repuls by mariu at
thi doubl discharg whose furi seem augment by the stupor of the
night jean valjean start he rose turn toward the quarter

hi mind had just been illumin by thi flash of light
how bulli that cart would look on our barricad
the auvergnat wa snore

gavroch habitu to face the unexpect in all quarter had
everyth about him he fumbl in on of hi pocket and pull from
it a scrap of paper and a bit of red pencil filch from some
carpent
he wrote

and he sign it gavroch
that done he put the paper in the pocket of the still snore
auvergnat velvet vest seiz the cart shaft in both hand and set
off in the direct of the hall push the cart befor him at a
hard gallop with a gloriou and triumphant uproar
thi wa peril there wa a post at the royal print
establish gavroch did not think of thi thi post wa occupi
by the nation guard of the suburb the squad began to wake up and
head were rais from camp bed two street lantern broken in

for the last hour that boi had been creat an uproar in that
peaceabl arrondiss the uproar of a fly in a bottl the sergeant
of the banlieu lent an ear he wait he wa a prudent man
the mad rattl of the cart fill to overflow the possibl measur
of wait and decid the sergeant to make a reconnais
there a whole band of them there said he let us proce gentli
it wa clear that the hydra of anarchi had emerg from it box and
that it wa stalk abroad through the quarter
and the sergeant ventur out of the post with cautiou tread
all at onc gavroch push hi cart in front of him and at the
veri moment when he wa about to turn into the rue de

the masterstrok of strong men consist in save themselv by the
veri mean that have ruin them gavroch took in the whole situat
at a glanc it wa the cart which had told against him it wa the
cart place to protect him
at the moment when the sergeant wa on the point of make hi descent
on gavroch the cart convert into a projectil and launch with
all the latter might roll down upon him furious and the
sergeant struck full in the stomach tumbl over backward into the
gutter while hi gun went off in the air
the men of the post had rush out pellmel at the sergeant shout

sixteen year count in the subterranean educ of insurrect and
june 1848 knew a great deal more about it than june 1832 so the
barricad of the rue de la chanvreri wa onli an outlin and an
embryo compar to the two coloss barricad which we have just
sketch but it wa formid for that epoch
the insurg under the ey of enjolra for mariu no longer look

rubbish brought and ad from all direct complic the extern
confus the redoubt had been cleverli made over into a wall on the
insid and a thicket on the outsid
the staircas of pavingston which permit on to mount it like the

feuilli emploi these two hour in engrav thi inscript on the
wall which face the tavern

these four word hollow out in the rough stone with a nail could be
still read on the wall in 1848
the three women had profit by the respit of the night to vanish
definit which allow the insurg to breath more freeli
thei had found mean of take refug in some neighbor hous
the greater part of the wound were abl and wish to fight still
on a litter of mattress and truss of straw in the kitchen which
had been convert into an ambul there were five men grave
wound two of whom were municip guardsmen the municip guardsmen
were attend to first
in the taproom there remain onli mabeuf under hi black cloth and
javert bound to hi post

of vast vagu cross result from javert erect and mabeuf ly prone
the pole of the omnibu although snap off by the fusillad wa
still suffici upright to admit of their fasten the flag to it
enjolra who possess that qualiti of a leader of alwai do what
he said attach to thi staff the bulletridden and bloodi coat of
the old man
no repast had been possibl there wa neither bread nor meat the
fifti men in the barricad had speedili exhaust the scanti provis

chapter iiilight and shadow
enjolra had been to make a reconnaiss he had made hi wai out
through mondtour lane glide along close to the hous
the insurg we will remark were full of hope the manner in which
thei had repuls the attack of the preced night had caus them to
almost disdain in advanc the attack at dawn thei wait for it with a
smile thei had no more doubt as to their success than as to their
caus moreov succor wa evid on the wai to them thei
reckon on it with that facil of triumphant propheci which is on
of the sourc of strength in the french combat thei divid the
dai which wa at hand into three distinct phase at six oclock in the
morn a regiment which had been labor with would turn at noon
the insurrect of all pari at sunset revolut
thei heard the alarm bell of saintmerri which had not been silent for
an instant sinc the night befor a proof that the other barricad
the great on jeann still held out
all these hope were exchang between the differ group in a sort
of gai and formid whisper which resembl the warlik hum of a hive
of bee
enjolra reappear he return from hi sombr eagl flight into
outer dark he listen for a moment to all thi joi with fold
arm and on hand on hi mouth then fresh and rosi in the grow
white of the dawn he said
the whole armi of pari is to strike a third of the armi is bear
down upon the barricad in which you now ar there is the nation

these word fell upon the buzz of the group and produc on them
the effect caus on a swarm of bee by the first drop of a storm a
moment of indescrib silenc ensu in which death might have been
heard flit by
thi moment wa brief
a voic from the obscurest depth of the group shout to enjolra
so be it let us rais the barricad to a height of twenti feet and
let us all remain in it citizen let us offer the protest of
corps let us show that if the peopl abandon the republican the
republican do not abandon the peopl
these word freed the thought of all from the pain cloud of
individu anxieti it wa hail with an enthusiast acclam
no on ever ha known the name of the man who spoke thu he wa some
unknown blousewear a stranger a man forgotten a pass hero
that great anonym alwai mingl in human crise and in social
genes who at a given moment utter in a suprem fashion the
decis word and who vanish into the shadow after have
repres for a minut in a lightn flash the peopl and god
thi inexor resolut so thoroughli impregn the air of the 6th
of june 1832 that almost at the veri same hour on the barricad
saintmerri the insurg were rais that clamor which ha becom a
matter of histori and which ha been consign to the document in the

us get ourselv kill here to the veri last man
as the reader see the two barricad though materi isol

chapter ivminu five plu on
after the man who decre the protest of corps had spoken and had
given thi formula of their common soul there issu from all mouth a
strang satisfi and terribl cry funer in sens and triumphant

let those who ar afraid of not number more than thirti sai so
the murmur redoubl
besid observ a voic in on group it is easi enough to talk
about leav the barricad is hem in
not on the side of the hall said enjolra the rue mondtour is

there wa someth to be heard a mysteri movement wa go on at
a certain distanc it wa evid that the critic moment wa
approach as on the previou even the sentinel had come in but
thi time all had come
the barricad wa stronger than on the occas of the first attack
sinc the departur of the five thei had increas it height still
further
on the advic of the sentinel who had examin the region of the

courfeyrac with a laugh
enjolra had about thirti pavingston torn up in excess said
bossuet pile up near the door of the wineshop
the silenc wa now so profound in the quarter whenc the attack must

gavroch produc a greater sensat in the barricad than the

mariu drew him asid with a shudder

and he stare at mariu intent with hi epic effronteri hi ey
grew larger with the proud light within them
it wa with an accent of sever that mariu continu
who told you to come back did you deliv my letter at the address
gavroch wa not without some compunct in the matter of that
letter in hi hast to return to the barricad he had got rid of it
rather than deliv it he wa forc to acknowledg to himself that
he had confid it rather lightli to that stranger whose face he had
not been abl to make out it is true that the man wa barehead but
that wa not suffici in short he had been administ to himself
littl inward remonstr and he fear mariu reproach in order
to extric himself from the predica he took the simplest cours
he li abomin

mariu had had two object in send that letter to bid farewel to

the despatch of hi letter and the presenc of m fauchelev in the

fauchelev to gavroch
do you know that man
no said gavroch
gavroch had in fact as we have just mention seen jean valjean

courfeyrac had it return to him
gavroch warn hi comrad as he call them that the barricad

wa face them in front
thi inform given gavroch ad
i author you to hit em a tremend whack
meanwhil enjolra wa strain hi ear and watch at hi

the assail dissatisfi no doubt with their shot had not
repeat it
a compani of infantri of the line had come up and occupi the end of
the street behind the piec of ordnanc the soldier were tear up
the pavement and construct with the stone a small low wall a sort
of sidework not more than eighteen inch high and face the
barricad in the angl at the left of thi epaul there wa
visibl the head of the column of a battalion from the suburb mass
in the rue saintdeni
enjolra on the watch thought he distinguish the peculiar sound
which is produc when the shell of grapeshot ar drawn from the
caisson and he saw the command of the piec chang the elev
and inclin the mouth of the cannon slightli to the left then the
cannon began to load the piec the chief seiz the lintstock
himself and lower it to the vent
down with your head hug the wall shout enjolra and all on
your knee along the barricad
the insurg who were straggl in front of the wineshop and who
had quit their post of combat on gavroch arriv rush
pellmel toward the barricad but befor enjolra order could be
execut the discharg took place with the terrifi rattl of a
round of grapeshot thi is what it wa in fact
the charg had been aim at the cut in the redoubt and had there
rebound from the wall and thi terribl rebound had produc two
dead and three wound
if thi were continu the barricad wa no longer tenabl the
grapeshot made it wai in
a murmur of constern aros
let us prevent the second discharg said enjolra
and lower hi rifl he took aim at the captain of the gun who at
that moment wa bear down on the breach of hi gun and rectifi
and definit fix it point
the captain of the piec wa a handsom sergeant of artilleri veri
young blond with a veri gentl face and the intellig air peculiar
to that predestin and redoubt weapon which by dint of perfect
itself in horror must end in kill war
combeferr who wa stand besid enjolra scrutin thi young
man
what a piti said combeferr what hideou thing these butcheri
ar come when there ar no more king there will be no more war
enjolra you ar take aim at that sergeant you ar not look at
him fanci he is a charm young man he is intrepid it is evid
that he is thought those young artillerymen ar veri well
educ he ha a father a mother a famili he is probabl in love
he is not more than five and twenti at the most he might be your

ye repli combeferr he is mine too well let us not kill him
let me alon it must be done
and a tear trickl slowli down enjolra marbl cheek
at the same moment he press the trigger of hi rifl the flame
leap forth the artilleryman turn round twice hi arm extend
in front of him hi head uplift as though for breath then he fell
with hi side on the gun and lai there motionless thei could see hi

infal marksmanship which influenc the condemn of 1796
opinion were exchang in the barricad the fire from the gun wa
about to begin again against that grapeshot thei could not hold out
a quarter of an hour longer it wa absolut necessari to deaden the
blow
enjolra issu thi command
we must place a mattress there
we have none said combeferr the wound ar ly on them
jean valjean who wa seat apart on a stone post at the corner of
the tavern with hi gun between hi knee had up to that moment
taken no part in anyth that wa go on he did not appear to hear
the combat sai around him here is a gun that is do
noth
at the order issu by enjolra he rose
it will be rememb that on the arriv of the rabbl in the rue de
la chanvreri an old woman forese the bullet had place her
mattress in front of her window thi window an attic window wa on
the roof of a sixstori hous situat a littl beyond the barricad
the mattress place crosswis support at the bottom on two pole
for dry linen wa upheld at the top by two rope which at that
distanc look like two thread and which were attach to two nail
plant in the window frame these rope were distinctli visibl like
hair against the sky
can some on lend me a doublebarrel rifl said jean valjean
enjolra who had just reload hi hand it to him
jean valjean took aim at the attic window and fire

of the attic window the mattress slip between the two pole and
fell into the street

the mattress had in fact fallen outsid the barricad between
besieg and besieg now the death of the sergeant of artilleri
have exasper the troop the soldier had for sever minut
been ly flat on their stomach behind the line of pavingston
which thei had erect and in order to suppli the forc silenc of
the piec which wa quiet while it servic wa in cours of
reorgan thei had open fire on the barricad the insurg
did not repli to thi musketri in order to spare their ammunit the
fusillad broke against the barricad but the street which it fill
wa terribl
jean valjean step out of the cut enter the street travers the
storm of bullet walk up to the mattress hoist it upon hi back
and return to the barricad
he place the mattress in the cut with hi own hand he fix it there
against the wall in such a manner that the artillerymen should not see
it
that done thei await the next discharg of grapeshot
it wa not long in come
the cannon vomit forth it packag of buckshot with a roar but there
wa no rebound the effect which thei had foreseen had been attain
the barricad wa save
citizen said enjolra to jean valjean the republ thank you
bossuet admir and laugh he exclaim
it is immor that a mattress should have so much power triumph of
that which yield over that which strike with lightn but never
mind glori to the mattress which annul a cannon

thoroughli reassur like jean valjean she had a few hour
previous pass through that reaction of the soul which absolut
will not hear of unhappi she began to cherish hope with all her
might without know why then she felt a pang at her heart it wa

she felt that she could not live without mariu and that
consequ that wa suffici and that mariu would come no
object wa valid all thi wa certain it wa monstrou enough
alreadi to have suffer for three dai mariu absent three dai thi

the object of thi mode of fire wa to drive the insurg from the

he wa a bourgeoi the same person perhap whom mariu had on dai
heard through hi love fever near the same grand basin counsel
hi son to avoid excess he had an affabl and haughti air and a

smile produc by too much jaw and too littl skin show the teeth
rather than the soul the child with hi brioch which he had bitten
into but had not finish eat seem satiat the child wa
dress as a nation guardsman ow to the insurrect and the
father had remain clad as a bourgeoi out of prudenc
father and son halt near the fountain where two swan were sport
thi bourgeoi appear to cherish a special admir for the swan
he resembl them in thi sens that he walk like them
for the moment the swan were swim which is their princip
talent and thei were superb
if the two poor littl be had listen and if thei had been of an

the child hesit a person mai not want ani more of hi cake but
that is no reason for give it awai
the father went on

and take the cake from hi son he flung it into the basin
the cake fell veri near the edg
the swan were far awai in the centr of the basin and busi with some
prei thei had seen neither the bourgeoi nor the brioch
the bourgeoi feel that the cake wa in danger of be wast and
move by thi useless shipwreck enter upon a telegraph agit
which final attract the attent of the swan
thei perceiv someth float steer for the edg like ship as
thei ar and slowli direct their cours toward the brioch with the

jean valjean had the pistol in hi hand
in thi manner thei cross the inner trapezium of the barricad the

and the two pistol which the latter had hand to him and which he
mariu had us in thi veri barricad and not onli did he recal hi
face but hi name as well
thi recollect wa misti and troubl howev like all hi idea
it wa not an affirm that he made but a question which he put to
himself

journei toward the celesti and the divin it ha it halt place
where it ralli the laggard troop it ha it station where it
medit in the presenc of some splendid canaan suddenli unveil on
it horizon it ha it night when it sleep and it is on of the
poignant anxieti of the thinker that he see the shadow rest on
the human soul and that he grope in dark without be abl to
awaken that slumber progress
god is dead perhap said gerard de nerval on dai to the writer of
these line confound progress with god and take the interrupt
of movement for the death of be
he who despair is in the wrong progress infal awak and in
short we mai sai that it march on even when it is asleep for it
ha increas in size when we behold it erect onc more we find it
taller to be alwai peac doe not depend on progress ani more than
it doe on the stream erect no barrier cast in no boulder
obstacl make water froth and human boil henc aris troubl but
after these troubl we recogn the fact that ground ha been
gain until order which is noth els than univers peac ha
been establish until harmoni and uniti reign progress will have
revolut as it haltingplac
what then is progress we have just enunci it the perman life
of the peopl
now it sometim happen that the momentari life of individu
offer resist to the etern life of the human race
let us admit without bitter that the individu ha hi distinct
interest and can without forfeitur stipul for hi interest and
defend it the present ha it pardon dose of egot momentari
life ha it right and is not bound to sacrific itself constantli to
the futur the gener which is pass in it turn over the earth
is not forc to abridg it for the sake of the gener it equal
after all who will have their turn later oni exist murmur that
some on whose name is all i am young and in love i am old and i
wish to repos i am the father of a famili i toil i prosper i am
success in busi i have hous to leas i have monei in the
govern fund i am happi i have a wife and children i have all
thi i desir to live leav me in peaceh at certain hour a
profound cold brood over the magnanim vanguard of the human race
utopia moreov we must admit quit it radiant sphere when it make
war it the truth of tomorrow borrow it mode of procedur battl
from the lie of yesterdai it the futur behav like the past it
pure idea becom a deed of violenc it complic it heroism with
a violenc for which it is just that it should be held to answer a
violenc of occas and expedi contrari to principl and for
which it is fatal punish the utopia insurrect fight with the
old militari code in it fist it shoot spi it execut traitor
it suppress live be and fling them into unknown dark it
make us of death a seriou matter it seem as though utopia had no
longer ani faith in radianc it irresist and incorrupt forc
it strike with the sword now no sword is simpl everi blade ha two
edg he who wound with the on is wound with the other
have made thi reserv and made it with all sever it is
imposs for us not to admir whether thei succe or not those the
gloriou combat of the futur the confessor of utopia even when
thei miscarri thei ar worthi of vener and it is perhap in
failur that thei possess the most majesti victori when it is in
accord with progress merit the applaus of the peopl but a heroic
defeat merit their tender compass the on is magnific the
other sublim for our own part we prefer martyrdom to success john
brown is greater than washington and pisacan is greater than
garibaldi
it certainli is necessari that some on should take the part of the
vanquish
we ar unjust toward these great men who attempt the futur when thei
fail
revolutionist ar accus of sow fear abroad everi barricad seem
a crime their theori ar incrimin their aim suspect their
ulterior motiv is fear their conscienc denounc thei ar
reproach with rais erect and heap up against the reign
social state a mass of miseri of grief of iniqu of wrong
of despair and of tear from the lowest depth block of shadow in
order therein to embattl themselv and to combat peopl shout to
them you ar tear up the pavement of hell thei might repli
that is becaus our barricad is made of good intent
the best thing assuredli is the pacif solut in short let us
agre that when we behold the pavement we think of the bear and it is
a good will which render societi uneasi but it depend on societi to
save itself it is to it own good will that we make our appeal no
violent remedi is necessari to studi evil amiabl to prove it
exist then to cure it it is to thi that we invit it
howev that mai be even when fallen abov all when fallen these
men who at everi point of the univers with their ey fix on
franc ar strive for the grand work with the inflex logic of
the ideal ar august thei give their life a free offer to
progress thei accomplish the will of provid thei perform a
religi act at the appoint hour with as much disinterested as
an actor who answer to hi cue in obedi to the divin
stagemanag thei enter the tomb and thi hopeless combat thi
stoical disappear thei accept in order to bring about the suprem
and univers consequ the magnific and irresist human
movement begun on the 14th of juli 1789 these soldier ar priest
the french revolut is an act of god
moreov there ar and it is proper to add thi distinct to the
distinct alreadi point out in anoth chapterther ar accept
revolut revolut which ar call revolut there ar
refus revolut which ar call riot
an insurrect which break out is an idea which is pass it
examin befor the peopl if the peopl let fall a black ball
the idea is dri fruit the insurrect is a mere skirmish
wage war at everi summon and everi time that utopia desir it is
not the thing for the peopl nation have not alwai and at everi
hour the tempera of hero and martyr
thei ar posit a priori insurrect is repugn to them in
the first place becaus it often result in a catastroph in the
second place becaus it alwai ha an abstract as it point of
departur
becaus and thi is a nobl thing it is alwai for the ideal and for
the ideal alon that those who sacrific themselv do thu sacrific
themselv an insurrect is an enthusiasm enthusiasm mai wax wroth
henc the appeal to arm but everi insurrect which aim at a
govern or a rgime aim higher thu for instanc and we insist
upon it what the chief of the insurrect of 1832 and in
particular the young enthusiast of the rue de la chanvreri were
combat wa not precis loui philipp the major of them when
talk freeli did justic to thi king who stood midwai between
monarchi and revolut no on hate him but thei attack the
younger branch of the divin right in loui philipp as thei had
attack it elder branch in charl x and that which thei wish to
overturn in overturn royalti in franc wa as we have explain
the usurp of man over man and of privileg over right in the
entir univers pari without a king ha as result the world without
despot thi is the manner in which thei reason their aim wa
distant no doubt vagu perhap and it retreat in the face of their
effort but it wa great
thu it is and we sacrific ourselv for these vision which ar
almost alwai illus for the sacrif but illus with which
after all the whole of human certainti is mingl we throw ourselv
into these tragic affair and becom intox with that which we ar
about to do who know we mai succe we ar few in number we have a
whole armi arrai against us but we ar defend right the natur
law the sovereignti of each on over himself from which no abdic
is possibl justic and truth and in case of need we die like the
three hundr spartan we do not think of don quixot but of leonida
and we march straight befor us and onc pledg we do not draw back
and we rush onward with head held low cherish as our hope an
unpreced victori revolut complet progress set free again
the aggrandiz of the human race univers deliver and in the
event of the worst thermopyl
these passag of arm for the sake of progress often suffer shipwreck
and we have just explain why the crowd is restiv in the presenc of
the impuls of paladin heavi mass the multitud which ar
fragil becaus of their veri weight fear adventur and there is a
touch of adventur in the ideal
moreov and we must not forget thi interest which ar not veri
friendli to the ideal and the sentiment ar in the wai sometim the
stomach paralyz the heart
the grandeur and beauti of franc li in thi that she take less
from the stomach than other nation she more easili knot the rope
about her loin she is the first awak the last asleep she march
forward she is a seeker
thi aris from the fact that she is an artist
the ideal is noth but the culmin point of logic the same as
the beauti is noth but the summit of the true artist peopl
ar also consist peopl to love beauti is to see the light that
is why the torch of europ that is to sai of civil wa first
born by greec who pass it on to itali who hand it on to franc
divin illumin nation of scout vitlampada tradunt
it is an admir thing that the poetri of a peopl is the element of

imagin onli a civil peopl should remain a manli peopl
corinth ye sybari no whoever becom effemin make himself a
bastard he must be neither a dilettant nor a virtuoso but he must be
artist in the matter of civil he must not refin but he
must sublim on thi condit on give to the human race the
pattern of the ideal
the modern ideal ha it type in art and it mean is scienc it is
through scienc that it will realiz that august vision of the poet
the social beauti eden will be reconstruct by ab at the point
which civil ha now reach the exact is a necessari element of
the splendid and the artist sentiment is not onli serv but
complet by the scientif organ dream must be calcul art
which is the conqueror should have for support scienc which is the

the modern spirit is the geniu of greec with the geniu of india as

franc is in the same qualiti of race as greec and itali she is
athenian in the matter of beauti and roman in her great moreov
she is good she give herself often than is the case with other
race is she in the humor for selfdevot and sacrific onli thi
humor seiz upon her and again abandon her and therein li the
great peril for those who run when she desir onli to walk or who
walk on when she desir to halt franc ha her relaps into

sublim brain have no longer anyth which recal french great

let us state these fact calmli death on the barricad or the tomb in
exil is an accept occas for devot the real name of
devot is disinterested let the abandon allow themselv to be
abandon let the exil allow themselv to be exil and let us
confin ourselv to entreat great nation not to retreat too far
when thei do retreat on must not push too far in descent under
pretext of a return to reason
matter exist the minut exist interest exist the stomach exist
but the stomach must not be the sole wisdom the life of the moment ha
it right we admit but perman life ha it right also ala the
fact that on is mount doe not preclud a fall thi can be seen in

the ideal then it bite the mire and find it good and if it be
ask how it happen that it ha abandon socrat for falstaff it

on word more befor return to our subject the conflict
a battl like the on which we ar engag in describ is noth
els than a convuls toward the ideal progress trammel is
sickli and is subject to these tragic epilepsi with that maladi of
progress civil war we have been oblig to come in contact in our
passag thi is on of the fatal phase at onc act and entract of

the cry to which we frequent give utter is our whole thought

allow it light to shine through

from it cluster of lightn the barricad wa underneath it
on both side the resolut wa equal the braveri exhibit there

there ar peopl who observ the rule of honor as on observ the

the interior of the barricad wa so strewn with torn cartridg that

then there burst forth on that heap of pavingston in that rue de la

chapter xxivprison
mariu wa in fact a prison
the hand which had seiz him from behind and whose grasp he had felt
at the moment of hi fall and hi loss of conscious wa that of
jean valjean
jean valjean had taken no other part in the combat than to expos
himself in it had it not been for him no on in that suprem phase
of agoni would have thought of the wound thank to him everywher
present in the carnag like a provid those who fell were pick
up transport to the taproom and care for in the interv he
reappear on the barricad but noth which could resembl a blow
an attack or even person defenc proceed from hi hand he held
hi peac and lent succor moreov he had receiv onli a few
scratch the bullet would have none of him if suicid form part
of what he had medit on come to thi sepulchr to that spot he
had not succeed but we doubt whether he had thought of suicid an
irreligi act
jean valjean in the thick cloud of the combat did not appear to see
mariu the truth is that he never took hi ey from the latter when
a shot laid mariu low jean valjean leap forward with the agil of
a tiger fell upon him as on hi prei and bore him off
the whirlwind of the attack wa at that moment so violent
concentr upon enjolra and upon the door of the wineshop that no
on saw jean valjean sustain the faint mariu in hi arm
travers the unpav field of the barricad and disappear behind the
angl of the corinth build
the reader will recal thi angl which form a sort of cape on the
street it afford shelter from the bullet the grapeshot and all
ey and a few squar feet of space there is sometim a chamber
which doe not burn in the midst of a conflagr and in the midst
of rage sea beyond a promontori or at the extrem of a blind
allei of shoal a tranquil nook it wa in thi sort of fold in the
interior trapezium of the barricad that ponin had breath her
last
there jean valjean halt let mariu slide to the ground place hi
back against the wall and cast hi ey about him
the situat wa alarm
for an instant for two or three perhap thi bit of wall wa a
shelter but how wa he to escap from thi massacr he recal the
anguish which he had suffer in the rue polonceau eight year befor
and in what manner he had contriv to make hi escap it wa
difficult then todai it wa imposs he had befor him that deaf
and implac hous six stori in height which appear to be
inhabit onli by a dead man lean out of hi window he had on hi
right the rather low barricad which shut off the rue de la petit
truanderi to pass thi obstacl seem easi but beyond the crest of
the barrier a line of bayonet wa visibl the troop of the line were
post on the watch behind that barricad it wa evid that to pass
the barricad wa to go in quest of the fire of the platoon and that
ani head which should run the risk of lift itself abov the top of
that wall of stone would serv as a target for sixti shot on hi
left he had the field of battl death lurk round the corner of that
wall
what wa to be done
onli a bird could have extric itself from thi predica
and it wa necessari to decid on the instant to devis some
expedi to come to some decis fight wa go on a few pace
awai fortun all were rage around a singl point the door of
the wineshop but if it should occur to on soldier to on singl
soldier to turn the corner of the hous or to attack him on the
flank all wa over
jean valjean gaze at the hous face him he gaze at the barricad
at on side of him then he look at the ground with the violenc of
the last extrem bewild and as though he would have like to
pierc a hole there with hi ey
by dint of stare someth vagu strike in such an agoni began
to assum form and outlin at hi feet as though it had been a power
of glanc which made the thing desir unfold a few pace distant he
perceiv at the base of the small barrier so pitilessli guard and
watch on the exterior beneath a disord mass of pavingston
which partli conceal it an iron grate place flat and on a level
with the soil thi grate made of stout transvers bar wa about
two feet squar the frame of pavingston which support it had been
torn up and it wa as it were unfasten
through the bar a view could be had of a dark apertur someth like
the flue of a chimnei or the pipe of a cistern jean valjean dart
forward hi old art of escap rose to hi brain like an illumin
to thrust asid the stone to rais the grate to lift mariu who
wa as inert as a dead bodi upon hi shoulder to descend with thi
burden on hi loin and with the aid of hi elbow and knee into that
sort of well fortun not veri deep to let the heavi trap upon
which the loosen stone roll down afresh fall into it place
behind him to gain hi foot on a flag surfac three metr below
the surfaceal thi wa execut like that which on doe in dream
with the strength of a giant and the rapid of an eagl thi took
onli a few minut
jean valjean found himself with mariu who wa still unconsci in a
sort of long subterranean corridor
there reign profound peac absolut silenc night
the impress which he had formerli experienc when fall from the
wall into the convent recur to him onli what he wa carri
todai wa not cosett it wa mariu he could bare hear the

it wa in the sewer of pari that jean valjean found himself
still anoth resembl between pari and the sea as in the ocean
the diver mai disappear there
the transit wa an unheardof on in the veri heart of the citi
jean valjean had escap from the citi and in the twinkl of an
ey in the time requir to lift the cover and to replac it he had
pass from broad daylight to complet obscur from middai to
midnight from tumult to silenc from the whirlwind of thunder to the
stagnat of the tomb and by a vicissitud far more tremend even
than that of the rue polonceau from the most extrem peril to the most
absolut obscur
an abrupt fall into a cavern a disappear into the secret trapdoor
of pari to quit that street where death wa on everi side for that
sort of sepulchr where there wa life wa a strang instant he
remain for sever second as though bewild listen
stupefi the wastetrap of safeti had suddenli yawn beneath him
celesti good had in a manner captur him by treacheri
ador ambuscad of provid
onli the wound man did not stir and jean valjean did not know
whether that which he wa carri in that grave wa a live be or
a dead corps
hi first sensat wa on of blind all of a sudden he could see
noth it seem to him too that in on instant he had becom
deaf he no longer heard anyth the frantic storm of murder which
had been let loos a few feet abov hi head did not reach him thank
to the thick of the earth which separ him from it as we have
said otherwis than faintli and indistinctli and like a rumbl in
the depth he felt that the ground wa solid under hi feet that wa
all but that wa enough he extend on arm and then the other
touch the wall on both side and perceiv that the passag wa
narrow he slip and thu perceiv that the pavement wa wet he
cautious put forward on foot fear a hole a sink some gulf he
discov that the pave continu a gust of fetid inform him
of the place in which he stood
after the laps of a few minut he wa no longer blind a littl
light fell through the manhol through which he had descend and hi
ey becam accustom to thi cavern he began to distinguish
someth the passag in which he had burrowedno other word can
better express the situationwa wall in behind him it wa on of
those blind allei which the special jargon term branch in front
of him there wa anoth wall a wall like night the light of the
airhol di out ten or twelv pace from the point where jean valjean
stood and bare cast a wan pallor on a few metr of the damp wall
of the sewer beyond the opaqu wa massiv to penetr thither
seem horribl an entranc into it appear like an engulf a man
could howev plung into that wall of fog and it wa necessari so to
do hast wa even requisit it occur to jean valjean that the
grate which he had caught sight of under the flagston might also
catch the ey of the soldieri and that everyth hung upon thi
chanc thei also might descend into that well and search it there wa
not a minut to be lost he had deposit mariu on the ground he
pick him up againthat is the real word for itplac him on hi
shoulder onc more and set out he plung resolut into the gloom
the truth is that thei were less safe than jean valjean fanci
peril of anoth sort and no less seriou were await them
perchanc after the lightningcharg whirlwind of the combat the
cavern of miasma and trap after chao the sewer jean valjean had
fallen from on circl of hell into anoth
when he had advanc fifti pace he wa oblig to halt a problem
present itself the passag termin in anoth gut which he
encount across hi path there two wai present themselv which
should he take ought he to turn to the left or to the right how wa
he to find hi bear in that black labyrinth thi labyrinth to
which we have alreadi call the reader attent ha a clue which
is it slope to follow to the slope is to arriv at the river
thi jean valjean instantli comprehend
he said to himself that he wa probabl in the sewer de hall that
if he were to choos the path to the left and follow the slope he
would arriv in less than a quarter of an hour at some mouth on the
sein between the pont au chang and the pontneuf that is to sai he
would make hi appear in broad daylight on the most dens peopl
spot in pari perhap he would come out on some manhol at the
intersect of street amaz of the passersbi at behold two
bleed men emerg from the earth at their feet arriv of the
polic a call to arm of the neighbor post of guard thu thei
would be seiz befor thei had even got out it would be better to
plung into that labyrinth to confid themselv to that black gloom
and to trust to provid for the outcom
he ascend the inclin and turn to the right
when he had turn the angl of the galleri the distant glimmer of an
airhol disappear the curtain of obscur fell upon him onc more
and he becam blind again nevertheless he advanc as rapidli as
possibl mariu two arm were pass round hi neck and the former
feet drag behind him he held both these arm with on hand and
grope along the wall with the other mariu cheek touch hi and
clung there bleed he felt a warm stream which came from mariu
trickl down upon him and make it wai under hi cloth but a
humid warmth near hi ear which the mouth of the wound man touch
indic respir and consequ life the passag along which
jean valjean wa now proceed wa not so narrow as the first jean
valjean walk through it with consider difficulti the rain of the
preced dai had not as yet entir run off and it creat a
littl torrent in the centr of the bottom and he wa forc to hug
the wall in order not to have hi feet in the water
thu he proceed in the gloom he resembl the be of the night
grope in the invis and lost beneath the earth in vein of shadow
still littl by littl whether it wa that the distant airhol
emit a littl waver light in thi opaqu gloom or whether hi
ey had becom accustom to the obscur some vagu vision return
to him and he began onc more to gain a confus idea now of the wall
which he touch now of the vault beneath which he wa pass the
pupil dilat in the dark and the soul dilat in misfortun and end
by find god there
it wa not easi to direct hi cours
the line of the sewer reecho so to speak the line of the street
which lie abov it there were then in pari two thousand two hundr
street let the reader imagin himself beneath that forest of gloomi
branch which is call the sewer the system of sewer exist at
that epoch place end to end would have given a length of eleven
leagu we have said abov that the actual network thank to the
special activ of the last thirti year wa no less than sixti
leagu in extent
jean valjean began by commit a blunder he thought that he wa
beneath the rue saintdeni and it wa a piti that it wa not so
under the rue saintdeni there is an old stone sewer which date from
loui xiii and which run straight to the collect sewer call the
grand sewer with but a singl elbow on the right on the elev of
the ancient cour de miracl and a singl branch the saintmartin
sewer whose four arm describ a cross but the gut of the
petitetruanderi the entranc to which wa in the vicin of the
corinth wineshop ha never commun with the sewer of the rue
saintdeni it end at the montmartr sewer and it wa in thi that
jean valjean wa entangl there opportun of lose oneself
abound the montmartr sewer is on of the most labyrinthin of the
ancient network fortun jean valjean had left behind him the
sewer of the market whose geometr plan present the appear of
a multitud of parrot roost pile on top of each other but he had
befor him more than on embarrass encount and more than on
street cornerfor thei ar streetspres itself in the gloom like
an interrog point first on hi left the vast sewer of the
pltrire a sort of chines puzzl thrust out and entangl it
chao of ts and zs under the postoffic and under the rotunda of the
wheat market as far as the sein where it termin in a y
secondli on hi right the curv corridor of the rue du cadran with
it three teeth which ar also blind court thirdli on hi left the
branch of the mail complic almost at it incept with a sort

de jeneur without count littl duct here and there befor
reach the belt sewer which alon could conduct him to some issu
suffici distant to be safe
had jean valjean had ani idea of all that we have here point out he
would speedili have perceiv mere by feel the wall that he wa
not in the subterranean galleri of the rue saintdeni instead of the
ancient stone instead of the antiqu architectur haughti and royal
even in the sewer with pavement and string cours of granit and

he advanc with anxieti but with calm see noth know
noth buri in chanc that is to sai engulf in provid
by degre we will admit a certain horror seiz upon him the gloom
which envelop him penetr hi spirit he walk in an enigma thi
aqueduct of the sewer is formid it interlac in a dizzi fashion
it is a melancholi thing to be caught in thi pari of shadow jean
valjean wa oblig to find and even to invent hi rout without see
it in thi unknown everi step that he risk might be hi last how
wa he to get out should he find an issu should he find it in time
would that coloss subterranean spong with it stone caviti allow
itself to be penetr and pierc should he there encount some
unexpect knot in the dark should he arriv at the inextric
and the impass would mariu die there of hemorrhag and he of
hunger should thei end by both get lost and by furnish two
skeleton in a nook of that night he did not know he put all these
question to himself without repli to them the intestin of pari
form a precipic like the prophet he wa in the belli of the monster
all at onc he had a surpris at the most unforeseen moment and
without have ceas to walk in a straight line he perceiv that he
wa no longer ascend the water of the rivulet wa beat against
hi heel instead of meet him at hi toe the sewer wa now
descend why wa he about to arriv suddenli at the sein thi
danger wa a great on but the peril of retreat wa still greater
he continu to advanc
it wa not toward the sein that he wa proceed the ridg which
the soil of pari form on it right bank empti on of it watersh
into the sein and the other into the grand sewer the crest of thi
ridg which determin the divis of the water describ a veri
caprici line the culmin point which is the point of
separ of the current is in the sainteavoy sewer beyond the
rue michellecomt in the sewer of the louvr near the boulevard
and in the montmartr sewer near the hall it wa thi culmin
point that jean valjean had reach he wa direct hi cours
toward the belt sewer he wa on the right path but he did not know
it
everi time that he encount a branch he felt of it angl and if
he found that the open which present itself wa smaller than the
passag in which he wa he did not enter but continu hi rout
rightli judg that everi narrow wai must need termin in a blind
allei and could onli lead him further from hi goal that is to sai
the outlet thu he avoid the quadrupl trap which wa set for him in
the dark by the four labyrinth which we have just enumer
at a certain moment he perceiv that he wa emerg from beneath the
pari which wa petrifi by the upris where the barricad had
suppress circul and that he wa enter beneath the live and
normal pari overhead he suddenli heard a nois as of thunder distant
but continu it wa the rumbl of vehicl
he had been walk for about half an hour at least accord to the
calcul which he made in hi own mind and he had not yet thought
of rest he had mere chang the hand with which he wa hold
mariu the dark wa more profound than ever but it veri depth
reassur him
all at onc he saw hi shadow in front of him it wa outlin on a
faint almost indistinct reddish glow which vagu empurpl the
floor vault underfoot and the vault overhead and gild to hi
right and to hi left the two viscou wall of the passag stupefi
he turn round
behind him in the portion of the passag which he had just pass
through at a distanc which appear to him immens pierc the

direct of the belt sewer thei were in fact the step of jean
valjean the sergeant in command of the patrol had rais hi lantern
and the squad had begun to gaze into the mist in the direct whenc
the sound proceed
thi wa an indescrib moment for jean valjean
happili if he saw the lantern well the lantern saw him but ill it
wa light and he wa shadow he wa veri far off and mingl with the
dark of the place he hug the wall and halt moreov he did
not understand what it wa that wa move behind him the lack of
sleep and food and hi emot had caus him also to pass into the
state of a visionari he beheld a gleam and around that gleam form
what wa it he did not comprehend
jean valjean have paus the sound ceas
the men of the patrol listen and heard noth thei look and saw
noth thei held a consult
there exist at that epoch at thi point of the montmartr sewer a
sort of crossroad call de servic which wa afterward
suppress on account of the littl interior lake which form there
swallow up the torrent of rain in heavi storm the patrol could
form a cluster in thi open space jean valjean saw these spectr form
a sort of circl these bulldog head approach each other close
and whisper togeth
the result of thi council held by the watch dog wa that thei had
been mistaken that there had been no nois that it wa useless to get
entangl in the belt sewer that it would onli be a wast of time but
that thei ought to hasten toward saintmerri that if there wa
anyth to do and ani bousingot to track out it wa in that
quarter
from time to time parti resol their old insult in 1832 the word
bousingot form the interim between the word jacobin which had becom
obsolet and the word demagogu which ha sinc render such
excel servic
the sergeant gave order to turn to the left toward the watersh of
the sein
if it had occur to them to separ into two squad and to go in
both direct jean valjean would have been captur all hung on
that thread it is probabl that the instruct of the prefectur
forese a possibl of combat and insurg in forc had
forbidden the patrol to part compani the patrol resum it march
leav jean valjean behind it of all thi movement jean valjean
perceiv noth except the eclips of the lantern which suddenli
wheel round
befor take hi departur the sergeant in order to acquit hi
policeman conscienc discharg hi gun in the direct of jean
valjean the deton roll from echo to echo in the crypt like the
rumbl of that titan entrail a bit of plaster which fell into the
stream and splash up the water a few pace awai from jean valjean
warn him that the ball had struck the arch over hi head
slow and measur step resound for some time on the timber work
gradual dy awai as thei retreat to a greater distanc the group
of black form vanish a glimmer of light oscil and float
commun to the vault a reddish glow which grew fainter then
disappear the silenc becam profound onc more the obscur
becam complet blind and deaf resum possess of the
shadow and jean valjean not dare to stir as yet remain for a
long time lean with hi back against the wall with strain ear
and dilat pupil watch the disappear of that phantom patrol
chapter iiith spun man
thi justic must be render to the polic of that period that even
in the most seriou public junctur it imperturb fulfil it
duti connect with the sewer and surveil a revolt wa in it
ey no pretext for allow malefactor to take the bit in their own
mouth and for neglect societi for the reason that the govern
wa in peril the ordinari servic wa perform correctli in compani
with the extraordinari servic and wa not troubl by the latter in
the midst of an incalcul polit event alreadi begun under the
pressur of a possibl revolut a polic agent spun a thief
without allow himself to be distract by insurrect and
barricad
it wa someth precis parallel which took place on the afternoon
of the 6th of june on the bank of the sein on the slope of the right
shore a littl beyond the pont de invalid
there is no longer ani bank there now the aspect of the local ha
chang
on that bank two men separ by a certain distanc seem to be
watch each other while mutual avoid each other the on who wa
in advanc wa try to get awai the on in the rear wa try to
overtak the other
it wa like a game of checker plai at a distanc and in silenc
neither seem to be in ani hurri and both walk slowli as though
each of them fear by too much hast to make hi partner redoubl hi
pace
on would have said that it wa an appetit follow it prei and
purpos without wear the air of do so the prei wa crafti and
on it guard
the proper relat between the hunt polecat and the hunt dog
were observ the on who wa seek to escap had an insignific
mien and not an impress appear the on who wa seek to seiz
him wa rude of aspect and must have been rude to encount
the first consciou that he wa the more feebl avoid the second
but he avoid him in a manner which wa deepli furiou ani on who
could have observ him would have discern in hi ey the sombr
hostil of flight and all the menac that fear contain
the shore wa desert there were no passersbi not even a boatman
nor a lighterman wa in the skiff which were moor here and there
it wa not easi to see these two men except from the quai opposit
and to ani person who had scrutin them at that distanc the man
who wa in advanc would have appear like a bristl tatter and
equivoc be who wa uneasi and trembl beneath a rag blous
and the other like a classic and offici personag wear the
frockcoat of author button to the chin
perchanc the reader might recogn these two men if he were to see
them closer at hand
what wa the object of the second man
probabl to succe in cloth the first more warmli
when a man cloth by the state pursu a man in rag it is in order
to make of him a man who is also cloth by the state onli the whole
question li in the color to be dress in blue is gloriou to be
dress in red is disagre
there is a purpl from below
it is probabl some unpleas and some purpl of thi sort which
the first man is desir of shirk
if the other allow him to walk on and had not seiz him as yet it
wa judg from all appear in the hope of see him lead up to
some signific meetingplac and to some group worth catch thi
delic oper is call spin
what render thi conjectur entir probabl is that the buttonedup
man on catch sight from the shore of a hackneycoach on the quai as
it wa pass along empti made a sign to the driver the driver
understood evid recogn the person with whom he had to deal
turn about and began to follow the two men at the top of the quai at
a footpac thi wa not observ by the slouch and tatter
personag who wa in advanc
the hackneycoach roll along the tree of the champslys the
bust of the driver whip in hand could be seen move along abov the
parapet
on of the secret instruct of the polic author to their
agent contain thi articl alwai have on hand a hackneycoach in
case of emerg
while these two men were manuvr each on hi own side with
irreproach strategi thei approach an inclin plane on the quai
which descend to the shore and which permit cabdriv arriv
from passi to come to the river and water their hors thi inclin
plane wa suppress later on for the sake of symmetri hors mai die
of thirst but the ey is gratifi
it is probabl that the man in the blous had intend to ascend thi
inclin plane with a view to make hi escap into the
champslys a place ornament with tree but in return much
infest with policemen and where the other could easili exercis
violenc
thi point on the quai is not veri far distant from the hous brought
to pari from moret in 1824 by colonel brack and design as the
hous of franoi i a guard hous is situat close at hand
to the great surpris of hi watcher the man who wa be track did
not mount by the inclin plane for water he continu to advanc
along the quai on the shore
hi posit wa visibl becom critic
what wa he intend to do if not to throw himself into the sein
henceforth there exist no mean of ascend to the quai there wa
no other inclin plane no staircas and thei were near the spot
mark by the bend in the sein toward the pont de jna where the
bank grow constantli narrow end in a slender tongu and wa
lost in the water there he would inevit find himself block
between the perpendicular wall on hi right the river on hi left and
in front of him and the author on hi heel
it is true that thi termin of the shore wa hidden from sight by
a heap of rubbish six or seven feet in height produc by some
demolit or other but did thi man hope to conceal himself
effectu behind that heap of rubbish which on need but skirt the
expedi would have been pueril he certainli wa not dream of
such a thing the innoc of thiev doe not extend to that point
the pile of rubbish form a sort of project at the water edg
which wa prolong in a promontori as far as the wall of the quai
the man who wa be follow arriv at thi littl mound and went
round it so that he ceas to be seen by the other
the latter as he did not see could not be seen he took advantag of
thi fact to abandon all dissimul and to walk veri rapidli in a
few moment he had reach the rubbish heap and pass round it there
he halt in sheer amaz the man whom he had been pursu wa no
longer there
total eclips of the man in the blous
the shore begin with the rubbish heap wa onli about thirti pace
long then it plung into the water which beat against the wall of the
quai the fugit could not have thrown himself into the sein without
be seen by the man who wa follow him what had becom of him
the man in the buttonedup coat walk to the extrem of the shore
and remain there in thought for a moment hi fist clench hi
ey search all at onc he smote hi brow he had just perceiv
at the point where the land came to an end and the water began a larg
iron grate low arch garnish with a heavi lock and with three
massiv hing thi grate a sort of door pierc at the base of the
quai open on the river as well as on the shore a blackish stream
pass under it thi stream discharg into the sein
beyond the heavi rusti iron bar a sort of dark and vault corridor
could be descri the man fold hi arm and stare at the grate
with an air of reproach
as thi gaze did not suffic he tri to thrust it asid he shook it
it resist solidli it is probabl that it had just been open
although no sound had been heard a singular circumst in so rusti a
grate but it is certain that it had been close again thi
indic that the man befor whom that door had just open had not a
hook but a kei
thi evid suddenli burst upon the mind of the man who wa try to
move the grate and evok from him thi indign ejacul
that is too much a govern kei
then immedi regain hi composur he express a whole world
of interior idea by thi outburst of monosyl accent almost
iron come come come come
that said and in the hope of someth or other either that he should
see the man emerg or other men enter he post himself on the watch
behind a heap of rubbish with the patient rage of a pointer
the hackneycoach which regul all it movement on hi had in
it turn halt on the quai abov him close to the parapet the
coachman forese a prolong wait encas hi hors muzzl in

chapter ivh also bear hi cross
jean valjean had resum hi march and had not again paus
thi march becam more and more labori the level of these vault
vari the averag height is about five feet six inch and ha been
calcul for the statur of a man jean valjean wa forc to bend
over in order not to strike mariu against the vault at everi step he
had to bend then to rise and to feel incessantli of the wall the
moistur of the stone and the viscou natur of the timber framework
furnish but poor support to which to cling either for hand or foot
he stumbl along in the hideou dungheap of the citi the
intermitt gleam from the airhol onli appear at veri long
interv and were so wan that the full sunlight seem like the light
of the moon all the rest wa mist miasma opaqu black jean
valjean wa both hungri and thirsti especi thirsti and thi like
the sea wa a place full of water where a man cannot drink hi
strength which wa prodigi as the reader know and which had been
but littl decreas by ag thank to hi chast and sober life began
to give wai nevertheless fatigu began to gain on him and as hi
strength decreas it made the weight of hi burden increas mariu
who wa perhap dead weigh him down as inert bodi weigh jean
valjean held him in such a manner that hi chest wa not oppress and
so that respir could proce as well as possibl between hi leg
he felt the rapid glide of the rat on of them wa frighten to
such a degre that he bit him from time to time a breath of fresh air
reach him through the venthol of the mouth of the sewer and
reanim him
it might have been three hour past middai when he reach the
beltsew
he wa at first astonish at thi sudden widen he found himself
all at onc in a galleri where hi outstretch hand could not reach
the two wall and beneath a vault which hi head did not touch the
grand sewer is in fact eight feet wide and seven feet high
at the point where the montmartr sewer join the grand sewer two
other subterranean galleri that of the rue de provenc and that of
the abattoir form a squar between these four wai a less sagaci
man would have remain undecid jean valjean select the broadest
that is to sai the beltsew but here the question again came
upshould he descend or ascend he thought that the situat requir
hast and that he must now gain the sein at ani risk in other term
he must descend he turn to the left
it wa well that he did so for it is an error to suppos that the
beltsew ha two outlet the on in the direct of berci the
other toward passi and that it is as it name indic the
subterranean girdl of the pari on the right bank the grand sewer
which is it must be rememb noth els than the old brook of
mnilmont termin if on ascend it in a blind sack that is
to sai at it ancient point of departur which wa it sourc at the
foot of the knoll of mnilmont there is no direct commun
with the branch which collect the water of pari begin with the
quartier popincourt and which fall into the sein through the amelot
sewer abov the ancient isl louvier thi branch which complet the
collect sewer is separ from it under the rue mnilmont
itself by a pile which mark the divid point of the water between
upstream and downstream if jean valjean had ascend the galleri he
would have arriv after a thousand effort and broken down with
fatigu and in an expir condit in the gloom at a wall he
would have been lost
in case of necess by retrac hi step a littl wai and enter
the passag of the fillesducalvair on condit that he did not
hesit at the subterranean cross of the carrefour boucherat and
by take the corridor saintloui then the saintgil gut on the
left then turn to the right and avoid the saintsebastian
galleri he might have reach the amelot sewer and thenc provid
that he did not go astrai in the sort of f which li under the
bastil he might have attain the outlet on the sein near the
arsen but in order to do thi he must have been thoroughli familiar
with the enorm madrepor of the sewer in all it ramif and
in all it open now we must again insist that he knew noth of
that fright drain which he wa travers and had ani on ask him
in what he wa he would have answer in the night
hi instinct serv him well to descend wa in fact possibl safeti
he left on hi right the two narrow passag which branch out in the
form of a claw under the rue laffitt and the rue saintgeorg and the
long bifurc corridor of the chauss dantin
a littl beyond an affluent which wa probabl the madelein branch
he halt he wa extrem weari a passabl larg airhol probabl
the manhol in the rue danjou furnish a light that wa almost
vivid jean valjean with the gentl of movement which a brother
would exercis toward hi wound brother deposit mariu on the
banquett of the sewer mariu bloodstain face appear under the
wan light of the airhol like the ash at the bottom of a tomb hi

cold and blood wa clot at the corner of hi mouth hi shirt had
thrust itself into hi wound the cloth of hi coat wa chafe the

breast hi heart wa still beat jean valjean tore up hi shirt
bandag the young man wound as well as he wa abl and stop the
flow blood then bend over mariu who still lai unconsci and
almost without breath in that half light he gaze at him with
inexpress hatr
on disarrang mariu garment he had found two thing in hi
pocket the roll which had been forgotten there on the preced
even and mariu pocketbook he at the roll and open the
pocketbook on the first page he found the four line written by
mariu the reader will recal them
my name is mariu pontmerci carri my bodi to my grandfath m
gillenormand rue de fillesducalvair no 6 in the marai
jean valjean read these four line by the light of the airhol and
remain for a moment as though absorb in thought repeat in a low
tone rue de fillesducalvair number 6 monsieur gillenormand he
replac the pocketbook in mariu pocket he had eaten hi strength
had return to him he took mariu up onc more upon hi back place
the latter head carefulli on hi right shoulder and resum hi
descent of the sewer
the grand sewer direct accord to the cours of the vallei of
mnilmont is about two leagu long it is pave throughout a
notabl portion of it extent
thi torch of the name of the street of pari with which we ar
illumin for the reader jean valjean subterranean march jean
valjean himself did not possess noth told him what zone of the citi
he wa travers nor what wai he had made onli the grow pallor of
the pool of light which he encount from time to time indic to
him that the sun wa withdraw from the pavement and that the dai
would soon be over and the roll of vehicl overhead have becom

conclud that he wa no longer under central pari and that he wa
approach some solitari region in the vicin of the outer

jean valjean nevertheless he continu to advanc grope hi wai in

suddenli thi dark becam terribl

he felt that he wa enter the water and that he no longer had a

jean valjean found himself in the presenc of a fonti
thi sort of quagmir wa common at that period in the subsoil of the
champslys difficult to handl in the hydraul work and a bad
preserv of the subterranean construct on account of it
excess fluiditi thi fluiditi exce even the inconsist of the
sand of the quartier saintgeorg which could onli be conquer by a
stone construct on a concret foundat and the clayei strata
infect with ga of the quartier de martyr which ar so liquid
that the onli wai in which a passag wa effect under the galleri de
martyr wa by mean of a castiron pipe when in 1836 the old stone
sewer beneath the faubourg sainthonor in which we now see jean
valjean wa demolish for the purpos of reconstruct it the
quicksand which form the subsoil of the champslys as far as the
sein present such an obstacl that the oper last nearli six
month to the great clamor of the dweller on the riversid
particularli those who had hotel and carriag the work wa more than
unhealthi it wa danger it is true that thei had four month and a
half of rain and three flood of the sein
the fonti which jean valjean had encount wa caus by the
downpour of the preced dai the pavement badli sustain by the
subjac sand had given wai and had produc a stoppag of the water
infiltr had taken place a slip had follow the disloc
bottom had sunk into the ooz to what extent imposs to sai the

jean valjean felt the pavement vanish beneath hi feet he enter
thi slime there wa water on the surfac slime at the bottom he
must pass it to retrac hi step wa imposs mariu wa dy

advanc moreov the pit seem for the first few step not to be

soon he had the slime up to hi calv and water abov hi knee he
walk on rais mariu in hi arm as far abov the water as he
could the mire now reach to hi knee and the water to hi waist
he could no longer retreat thi mud dens enough for on man could
not obvious uphold two mariu and jean valjean would have stood a
chanc of extric themselv singli jean valjean continu to
advanc support the dy man who wa perhap a corps
the water came up to hi armpit he felt that he wa sink it wa
onli with difficulti that he could move in the depth of ooz which he
had now reach the densiti which wa hi support wa also an
obstacl he still held mariu on high and with an unheardof
expenditur of forc he advanc still but he wa sink he had
onli hi head abov the water now and hi two arm hold up mariu
in the old paint of the delug there is a mother hold her child

he sank still deeper he turn hi face to the rear to escap the

he straighten himself up and root himself upon that point of
support with a sort of furi thi produc upon him the effect of the
first step in a staircas lead back to life
the point of support thu encount in the mire at the suprem
moment wa the begin of the other watersh of the pavement which
had bent but had not given wai and which had curv under the water

on thi plane he wa safe jean valjean mount thi inclin plane
and reach the other side of the quagmir
as he emerg from the water he came in contact with a stone and fell
upon hi knee he reflect that thi wa but just and he remain

have left hi strength behind him there that suprem effort had
exhaust him hi lassitud wa now such that he wa oblig to paus
for breath everi three or four step and lean against the wall onc
he wa forc to seat himself on the banquett in order to alter
mariu posit and he thought that he should have to remain there
but if hi vigor wa dead hi energi wa not he rose again
he walk on desper almost fast proceed thu for a hundr
pace almost without draw breath and suddenli came in contact with
the wall he had reach an elbow of the sewer and arriv at the
turn with head bent down he had struck the wall he rais hi ey
and at the extrem of the vault far veri far awai in front of him
he perceiv a light thi time it wa not that terribl light it wa
good white light it wa daylight jean valjean saw the outlet
a damn soul who in the midst of the furnac should suddenli
perceiv the outlet of gehenna would experi what jean valjean
felt it would fly wildli with the stump of it burn wing toward
that radiant portal jean valjean wa no longer consciou of fatigu
he no longer felt mariu weight he found hi leg onc more of steel
he ran rather than walk as he approach the outlet becam more and
more distinctli defin it wa a point arch lower than the vault
which gradual narrow and narrow than the galleri which close
in as the vault grew lower the tunnel end like the interior of a
funnel a faulti construct imit from the wicket of
penitentiari logic in a prison illog in a sewer and which
ha sinc been correct
jean valjean reach the outlet
there he halt
it certainli wa the outlet but he could not get out
the arch wa close by a heavi grate and the grate which to all
appear rare swung on it rusti hing wa clamp to it stone
jamb by a thick lock which red with rust seem like an enorm
brick the keyhol could be seen and the robust latch deepli sunk in
the iron stapl the door wa plainli doublelock it wa on of

the grandcail fli were enter and emerg through the bar of
the grate
it might have been halfpast eight oclock in the even the dai wa

jean valjean laid mariu down along the wall on the dry portion of the
vault then he went to the grate and clench both fist round the
bar the shock which he gave it wa frenzi but it did not move the
grate did not stir jean valjean seiz the bar on after the other
in the hope that he might be abl to tear awai the least solid and to
make of it a lever wherewith to rais the door or to break the lock
not a bar stir the teeth of a tiger ar not more firmli fix in

must he then stop there what wa he to do what wa to becom of him
he had not the strength to retrac hi step to recomm the journei
which he had alreadi taken besid how wa he to again travers that

all wa over everyth that jean valjean had done wa useless
exhaust had end in failur
thei were both caught in the immens and gloomi web of death and jean
valjean felt the terribl spider run along those black strand and
quiver in the shadow he turn hi back to the grate and fell
upon the pavement hurl to earth rather than seat close to mariu
who still made no movement and with hi head bent between hi knee
thi wa the last drop of anguish

thnardier resum
let settl up how much did the stiff have in hi bag
jean valjean search hi pocket
it wa hi habit as the reader will rememb to alwai have some

thnardier help jean valjean to replac mariu on hi shoulder then
he betook himself to the grate on tipto and barefoot make jean

thnardier open the gate a littl wai allow just suffici space
for jean valjean to pass out close the grate again gave the kei a

a moment later that hideou provid had retreat into the

it wa that exquisit and undecid hour which sai neither ye nor no
night wa alreadi suffici advanc to render it possibl to lose
oneself at a littl distanc and yet there wa suffici daylight to

for sever second jean valjean wa irresist overcom by that

not refrain from contempl that vast clear shadow which rest
over him thoughtfulli he bath in the sea of ecstasi and prayer in
the majest silenc of the etern heaven then he bent down swiftli
to mariu as though the sentiment of duti had return to him and
dip up water in the hollow of hi hand he gentli sprinkl a few
drop on the latter face mariu eyelid did not open but hi

jean valjean wa on the point of dip hi hand in the river onc

he turn round
some on wa in fact behind him as there had been a short while
befor
a man of lofti statur envelop in a long coat with fold arm and
bear in hi right fist a bludgeon of which the leaden head wa
visibl stood a few pace in the rear of the spot where jean valjean
wa crouch over mariu
with the aid of the dark it seem a sort of apparit an
ordinari man would have been alarm becaus of the twilight a
thought man on account of the bludgeon jean valjean recogn
javert
the reader ha divin no doubt that thnardier pursuer wa no
other than javert javert after hi unlookedfor escap from the

thu it will be easili understood that that grate so obligingli
open to jean valjean wa a bit of clever on thnardier part
thnardier intuit felt that javert wa still there the man spi
upon ha a scent which never deceiv him it wa necessari to fling a
bone to that sleuthhound an assassin what a godsend such an
opportun must never be allow to slip thnardier by put jean

wa concern on escap with the aid of thi divers
jean valjean had fallen from on danger upon anoth
these two encount thi fall on after the other from thnardier
upon javert wa a rude shock
javert did not recogn jean valjean who as we have state no
longer look like himself he did not unfold hi arm he made sure of
hi bludgeon in hi fist by an impercept movement and said in a
curt calm voic

javert thrust hi bludgeon between hi teeth bent hi knee inclin
hi bodi laid hi two power hand on the shoulder of jean valjean
which were clamp within them as in a coupl of vice scrutin

javert pass slowli down the rue de lhomm arm
he walk with droop head for the first time in hi life and
likewis for the first time in hi life with hi hand behind hi

up to that dai javert had borrow from napoleon attitud onli
that which is express of resolut with arm fold across the
chest that which is express of uncertaintywith the hand behind
the backhad been unknown to him now a chang had taken place hi
whole person slow and sombr wa stamp with anxieti
he plung into the silent street
nevertheless he follow on given direct
he took the shortest cut to the sein reach the quai de orm
skirt the quai pass the grve and halt at some distanc from
the post of the place du chtelet at the angl of the pont notredam
there between the notredam and the pont au chang on the on hand
and the quai de la mgisseri and the quai aux fleur on the other the
sein form a sort of squar lake travers by a rapid
thi point of the sein is dread by marin noth is more
danger than thi rapid hem in at that epoch and irrit by

liquid rope men who fall in there never reappear the best of
swimmer ar drown there
javert lean both elbow on the parapet hi chin rest in both
hand and while hi nail were mechan twine in the abund
of hi whisker he medit
a novelti a revolut a catastroph had just taken place in the
depth of hi be and he had someth upon which to examin
himself
javert wa undergo horribl suffer
for sever hour javert had ceas to be simpl he wa troubl
that brain so limpid in it blind had lost it transpar that
crystal wa cloud javert felt duti divid within hi conscienc
and he could not conceal the fact from himself when he had so
unexpectedli encount jean valjean on the bank of the sein there
had been in him someth of the wolf which regain hi grip on hi
prei and of the dog who find hi master again
he beheld befor him two path both equal straight but he beheld
two and that terrifi him him who had never in all hi life known
more than on straight line and the poignant anguish lai in thi
that the two path were contrari to each other on of these straight
line exclud the other which of the two wa the true on
hi situat wa indescrib
to ow hi life to a malefactor to accept that debt and to repai it
to be in spite of himself on a level with a fugit from justic
and to repai hi servic with anoth servic to allow it to be said
to him go and to sai to the latter in hi turn be free to
sacrific to person motiv duti that gener oblig and to be
consciou in those person motiv of someth that wa also
gener and perchanc superior to betrai societi in order to remain
true to hi conscienc that all these absurd should be realiz
and should accumul upon himthi wa what overwhelm him
on thing had amaz himthi wa that jean valjean should have done
him a favor and on thing petrifi himthat he javert should have
done jean valjean a favor
where did he stand he sought to comprehend hi posit and could no
longer find hi bear
what wa he to do now to deliv up jean valjean wa bad to leav
jean valjean at liberti wa bad in the first case the man of
author fell lower than the man of the gallei in the second a
convict rose abov the law and set hi foot upon it in both case
dishonor for him javert there wa disgrac in ani resolut at which
he might arriv destini ha some extrem which rise
perpendicularli from the imposs and beyond which life is no longer
anyth but a precipic javert had reach on of those extrem
on of hi anxieti consist in be constrain to think the veri
violenc of all these conflict emot forc him to it thought
wa someth to which he wa unus and which wa peculiarli pain
in thought there alwai exist a certain amount of intern rebellion
and it irrit him to have that within him
thought on ani subject whatev outsid of the restrict circl of
hi function would have been for him in ani case useless and a
fatigu thought on the dai which had just pass wa a tortur
nevertheless it wa indispens that he should take a look into hi
conscienc after such shock and render to himself an account of
himself
what he had just done made him shudder he javert had seen fit to
decid contrari to all the regul of the polic contrari to the
whole social and judici organ contrari to the entir code
upon a releas thi had suit him he had substitut hi own affair
for the affair of the public wa not thi unjustifi everi time
that he brought himself face to face with thi deed without a name
which he had commit he trembl from head to foot upon what should
he decid on sole resourc remain to him to return in all hast to
the rue de lhomm arm and commit jean valjean to prison it wa
clear that that wa what he ought to do he could not
someth bar hi wai in that direct
someth what is there in the world anyth outsid of the
tribun executori sentenc the polic and the author javert
wa overwhelm
a galleyslav sacr a convict who could not be touch by the law
and that the deed of javert
wa it not a fear thing that javert and jean valjean the man made
to proce with vigor the man made to submitthat these two men who
were both the thing of the law should have come to such a pass that
both of them had set themselv abov the law what then such
enorm were to happen and no on wa to be punish jean valjean
stronger than the whole social order wa to remain at liberti and he
javert wa to go on eat the govern bread
hi reveri gradual becam terribl
he might athwart thi reveri have also reproach himself on the
subject of that insurg who had been taken to the rue de
fillesducalvair but he never even thought of that the lesser fault
wa lost in the greater besid that insurg wa obvious a dead
man and legal death put an end to pursuit
jean valjean wa the load which weigh upon hi spirit
jean valjean disconcert him all the axiom which had serv him as
point of support all hi life long had crumbl awai in the presenc
of thi man jean valjean generos toward him javert crush
him other fact which he now recal and which he had formerli
treat as li and folli now recur to him as realiti m
madelein reappear behind jean valjean and the two figur were
superpos in such fashion that thei now form but on which wa
vener javert felt that someth terribl wa penetr hi
souladmir for a convict respect for a galleyslavei that a
possibl thing he shudder at it yet could not escap from it in
vain did he struggl he wa reduc to confess in hi inmost heart
the sublim of that wretch thi wa odiou
a benevol malefactor merci gentl help clement a convict
return good for evil give back pardon for hatr prefer piti
to vengeanc prefer to ruin himself rather than to ruin hi enemi
save him who had smitten him kneel on the height of virtu more
nearli akin to an angel than to a man javert wa constrain to admit
to himself that thi monster exist
thing could not go on in thi manner
certainli and we insist upon thi point he had not yield without
resist to that monster to that infam angel to that hideou
hero who enrag almost as much as he amaz him twenti time as he
sat in that carriag face to face with jean valjean the legal tiger
had roar within him a score of time he had been tempt to fling
himself upon jean valjean to seiz him and devour him that is to sai
to arrest him what more simpl in fact to cry out at the first post
that thei passedher is a fugit from justic who ha broken hi
ban to summon the gendarm and sai to them thi man is your
then to go off leav that condemn man there to ignor the rest
and not to meddl further in the matter thi man is forev a prison
of the law the law mai do with him what it will what could be more
just javert had said all thi to himself he had wish to pass
beyond to act to apprehend the man and then as at present he had
not been abl to do it and everi time that hi arm had been rais
convuls toward jean valjean collar hi hand had fallen back
again as beneath an enorm weight and in the depth of hi thought
he had heard a voic a strang voic cry to himit is well
deliv up your savior then have the basin of pontiu pilat brought
and wash your claw
then hi reflect revert to himself and besid jean valjean
glorifi he beheld himself javert degrad
a convict wa hi benefactor
but then why had he permit that man to leav him aliv he had the
right to be kill in that barricad he should have assert that
right it would have been better to summon the other insurg to hi
succor against jean valjean to get himself shot by forc
hi suprem anguish wa the loss of certainti he felt that he had been
uproot the code wa no longer anyth more than a stump in hi
hand he had to deal with scrupl of an unknown speci there had
taken place within him a sentiment revel entir distinct from
legal affirm hi onli standard of measur hitherto to remain
in hi former upright did not suffic a whole order of unexpect
fact had crop up and subjug him a whole new world wa dawn
on hi soul kind accept and repaid devot merci indulg
violenc commit by piti on auster respect for person no more
definit condemn no more convict the possibl of a tear
in the ey of the law no on know what justic accord to god
run in invers sens to justic accord to men he perceiv amid
the shadow the terribl rise of an unknown moral sun it horrifi
and dazzl him an owl forc to the gaze of an eagl
he said to himself that it wa true that there were except case
that author might be put out of counten that the rule might be
inadequ in the presenc of a fact that everyth could not be
frame within the text of the code that the unforeseen compel
obedi that the virtu of a convict might set a snare for the
virtu of the functionari that destini did indulg in such ambush
and he reflect with despair that he himself had not even been
fortifi against a surpris
he wa forc to acknowledg that good did exist thi convict had
been good and he himself unpreced circumst had just been
good also so he wa becom deprav
he found that he wa a coward he conceiv a horror of himself
javert ideal wa not to be human to be grand to be sublim it wa
to be irreproach
now he had just fail in thi
how had he come to such a pass how had all thi happen he could not
have told himself he clasp hi head in both hand but in spite of
all that he could do he could not contriv to explain it to himself
he had certainli alwai entertain the intent of restor jean
valjean to the law of which jean valjean wa the captiv and of which
he javert wa the slave not for a singl instant while he held him
in hi grasp had he confess to himself that he entertain the idea
of releas him it wa in some sort without hi conscious that
hi hand had relax and had let him go free
all sort of interrog point flash befor hi ey he put
question to himself and made repli to himself and hi repli
frighten him he ask himself what ha that convict done that
desper fellow whom i have pursu even to persecut and who ha
had me under hi foot and who could have aveng himself and who ow
it both to hi rancor and to hi safeti in leav me my life in
show merci upon me hi duti no someth more and i in show

it is requisit that at least two agent should never lose sight of

the grate of the sewer which abut on the bank of the river had
open that a man had emerg therefrom bear on hi shoulder
anoth man who seem to be dead that the agent who wa on the
watch at that point had arrest the live man and had seiz the
dead man that at the order of the policeag he the coachman had
taken all those folk into hi carriag that thei had first driven
to the rue de fillesducalvair that thei had there deposit the
dead man that the dead man wa monsieur mariu and that he the
coachman recogn him perfectli although he wa aliv thi time
that afterward thei had enter the vehicl again that he had
whip up hi hors a few pace from the gate of the archiv thei
had call to him to halt that there in the street thei had paid him
and left him and that the policeag had led the other man awai
that he knew noth more that the night had been veri dark
mariu as we have said recal noth he onli rememb that he
had been seiz from behind by an energet hand at the moment when he
wa fall backward into the barricad then everyth vanish so
far as he wa concern

he wa lost in conjectur
he could not doubt hi own ident still how had it come to pass
that have fallen in the rue de la chanvreri he had been pick up
by the policeag on the bank of the sein near the pont de

some on had carri him from the quartier de hall to the
champslys and how through the sewer unheardof devot
some on who
thi wa the man for whom mariu wa search
of thi man who wa hi savior noth not a trace not the faintest

the prefectur knew less about the matter than did the
hackneycoachman thei had no knowledg of ani arrest have been made
on the 6th of june at the mouth of the grand sewer
no report of ani agent had been receiv there upon thi matter which
wa regard at the prefectur as a fabl the invent of thi fabl
wa attribut to the coachman
a coachman who want a gratuiti is capabl of anyth even of
imagin the fact wa assur nevertheless and mariu could not
doubt it unless he doubt hi own ident as we have just said
everyth about thi singular enigma wa inexplic
what had becom of that man that mysteri man whom the coachman had
seen emerg from the grate of the grand sewer bear upon hi back
the unconsci mariu and whom the policeag on the watch had
arrest in the veri act of rescu an insurg what had becom of
the agent himself
why had thi agent preserv silenc had the man succeed in make
hi escap had he bribe the agent why did thi man give no sign of
life to mariu who ow everyth to him hi disinterested wa
no less tremend than hi devot why had not that man appear
again perhap he wa abov compens but no on is abov
gratitud wa he dead who wa the man what sort of a face had he no
on could tell him thi
the coachman answer the night wa veri dark basqu and nicolett
all in a flutter had look onli at their young master all cover
with blood
the porter whose candl had light the tragic arriv of mariu had
been the onli on to take note of the man in question and thi is the
descript that he gave
that man wa terribl
mariu had the bloodstain cloth which he had worn when he had
been brought back to hi grandfath preserv in the hope that it
would prove of servic in hi research
on examin the coat it wa found that on skirt had been torn in a
singular wai a piec wa miss
on even mariu wa speak in the presenc of cosett and jean
valjean of the whole of that singular adventur of the innumer
inquiri which he had made and of the fruitless of hi effort
the cold counten of monsieur fauchelev anger him
he exclaim with a vivac which had someth of wrath in it
ye that man whoever he mai have been wa sublim do you know what
he did sir he interven like an archangel he must have flung
himself into the midst of the battl have stolen me awai have open
the sewer have drag me into it and have carri me through it he

and that corps i wa he said to himself there mai still be a
glimps of life there perchanc i will risk my own exist for that
miser spark and hi exist he risk not onc but twenti

strang to sai at that epoch peopl still imagin that a wed wa
a privat and social festiv that a patriarch banquet doe not
spoil a domest solemn that gayeti even in excess provid it be
honest and decent doe happi no harm and that in short it is a
good and a vener thing that the fusion of these two destini
whenc a famili is destin to spring should begin at home and that
the household should thenceforth have it nuptial chamber as it
wit
and peopl were so immodest as to marri in their own home
the marriag took place therefor in accord with thi now

the old and formid struggl of which we have alreadi wit so
mani phase began onc more
jacob struggl with the angel but on night ala how mani time have
we beheld jean valjean seiz bodili by hi conscienc in the
dark and struggl desper against it
unheardof conflict at certain moment the foot slip at other
moment the ground crumbl awai underfoot how mani time had that
conscienc mad for the good clasp and overthrown him how mani
time had the truth set her knee inexor upon hi breast how mani
time hurl to earth by the light had he beg for merci how mani
time had that implac spark light within him and upon him by
the bishop dazzl him by forc when he had wish to be blind how
mani time had he risen to hi feet in the combat held fast to the
rock lean against sophism drag in the dust now get the
upper hand of hi conscienc again overthrown by it how mani time
after an equivoqu after the speciou and treacher reason of
egot had he heard hi irrit conscienc cry in hi ear a trip
you wretch how mani time had hi refractori thought rattl
convuls in hi throat under the evid of duti resist to
god funer sweat what secret wound which he alon felt bleed
what excori in hi lament exist how mani time he had
risen bleed bruis broken enlighten despair in hi heart
seren in hi soul and vanquish he had felt himself the
conqueror and after have disloc broken and rent hi
conscienc with redhot pincer it had said to him as it stood over
him formid lumin and tranquil now go in peac
but on emerg from so melancholi a conflict what a lugubri peac
ala
nevertheless that night jean valjean felt that he wa pass through
hi final combat
a heartrend question present itself
predestin ar not all direct thei do not open out in a straight
avenu befor the predestin man thei have blind court impass
allei obscur turn disturb crossroad offer the choic of
mani wai jean valjean had halt at that moment at the most peril
of these crossroad
he had come to the suprem cross of good and evil he had that
gloomi intersect beneath hi ey on thi occas onc more as
had happen to him alreadi in other sad vicissitud two road open
out befor him the on tempt the other alarm
which wa he to take
he wa counsel to the on which alarm him by that mysteri index
finger which we all perceiv whenev we fix our ey on the dark
onc more jean valjean had the choic between the terribl port and
the smile ambush
is it then true the soul mai recov but not fate fright thing
an incur destini
thi is the problem which present itself to him
in what manner wa jean valjean to behav in relat to the happi
of cosett and mariu it wa he who had will that happi it wa
he who had brought it about he had himself buri it in hi
entrail and at that moment when he reflect on it he wa abl to
enjoi the sort of satisfact which an armor would experi on
recogn hi factori mark on a knife on withdraw it all
smoke from hi own breast
cosett had mariu mariu possess cosett thei had everyth even
rich and thi wa hi do
but what wa he jean valjean to do with thi happi now that it
exist now that it wa there should he forc himself on thi
happi should he treat it as belong to him no doubt cosett
did belong to anoth but should he jean valjean retain of cosett
all that he could retain should he remain the sort of father half
seen but respect which he had hitherto been should he without
sai a word bring hi past to that futur should he present himself
there as though he had a right and should he seat himself veil at
that lumin firesid should he take those innoc hand into hi
tragic hand with a smile should he place upon the peac fender of
the gillenormand drawingroom those feet of hi which drag behind
them the disgrac shadow of the law should he enter into
particip in the fair fortun of cosett and mariu should he
render the obscur on hi brow and the cloud upon their still more
dens should he place hi catastroph as a third associ in their
felic should he continu to hold hi peac in a word should he be
the sinist mute of destini besid these two happi be
we must have becom habitu to fatal and to encount with it
in order to have the dare to rais our ey when certain question
appear to us in all their horribl naked good or evil stand
behind thi sever interrog point what ar you go to do
demand the sphinx
thi habit of trial jean valjean possess he gaze intent at the
sphinx
he examin the pitiless problem under all it aspect
cosett that charm exist wa the raft of thi shipwreck what
wa he to do to cling fast to it or to let go hi hold
if he clung to it he should emerg from disast he should ascend
again into the sunlight he should let the bitter water drip from hi
garment and hi hair he wa save he should live
and if he let go hi hold
then the abyss
thu he took sad council with hi thought or to speak more
correctli he fought he kick furious intern now against hi
will now against hi convict
happili for jean valjean that he had been abl to weep that reliev
him possibl but the begin wa savag a tempest more furiou
than the on which had formerli driven him to arra broke loos within
him the past surg up befor him face the present he compar them
and sob the silenc of tear onc open the despair man
writh
he felt that he had been stop short
ala in thi fight to the death between our egot and our duti when
we thu retreat step by step befor our immut ideal bewild
furiou exasper at have to yield disput the ground hope
for a possibl flight seek an escap what an abrupt and sinist
resist doe the foot of the wall offer in our rear
to feel the sacr shadow which form an obstacl
the invis inexor what an obsess
then on is never done with conscienc make your choic brutu make
your choic cato it is fathomless sinc it is god on fling into

somewher in the fog of the ancient hell there is a tun like that
is not on pardon if on at last refus can the inexhaust
have ani right ar not chain which ar endless abov human strength
who would blame sisyphu and jean valjean for sai it is enough
the obedi of matter is limit by friction is there no limit to
the obedi of the soul if perpetu motion is imposs can
perpetu selfsacrific be exact
the first step is noth it is the last which is difficult what wa
the champmathieu affair in comparison with cosett marriag and of
that which it entail what is a reentranc into the gallei
compar to entranc into the void
oh first step that must be descend how sombr art thou oh second
step how black art thou
how could he refrain from turn asid hi head thi time
martyrdom is sublim corros sublim it is a tortur which
consecr on can consent to it for the first hour on seat
oneself on the throne of glow iron on place on on head the

at length jean valjean enter into the peac of exhaust

decid to open which side of hi life did he resolv upon close and
condemn among all the unfathom precipic which surround him
which wa hi choic what extrem did he accept to which of the

jean valjean paus mariu listen such chain of idea and of
anguish cannot be interrupt jean valjean lower hi voic onc
more but it wa no longer a dull voiceit wa a sinist voic
you ask why i speak i am neither denounc nor pursu nor track
you sai ye i am denounc ye i am track by whom by myself it
is i who bar the passag to myself and i drag myself and i push
myself and i arrest myself and i execut myself and when on hold
oneself on is firmli held
and seiz a hand of hi own coat by the nape of the neck and
extend it toward mariu
do you see that fist he continu dont you think that it hold
that collar in such a wise as not to releas it well conscienc is
anoth grasp if on desir to be happi sir on must never
understand duti for as soon as on ha comprehend it it is
implac on would sai that it punish you for comprehend it
but no it reward you for it place you in a hell where you feel god
besid you on ha no sooner lacer hi own entrail than he is at
peac with himself
and with a poignant accent he ad
monsieur pontmerci thi is not common sens i am an honest man it
is by degrad myself in your ey that i elev myself in my own
thi ha happen to me onc befor but it wa less pain then it
wa a mere noth ye an honest man i should not be so if through
my fault you had continu to esteem me now that you despis me i am
so i have that fatal hang over me that not be abl to ever
have anyth but stolen consider that consider humili
me and crush me inwardli and in order that i mai respect myself
it is necessari that i should be despis then i straighten up again
i am a galleyslav who obei hi conscienc i know well that that is
most improb but what would you have me do about it it is the
fact i have enter into engag with myself i keep them there
ar encount which bind us there ar chanc which involv us in
duti you see monsieur pontmerci variou thing have happen to me
in the cours of my life
again jean valjean paus swallow hi saliva with an effort as
though hi word had a bitter aftertast and then he went on
when on ha such a horror hang over on on ha not the right to
make other share it without their knowledg on ha not the right to
make them slip over on own precipic without their perceiv it
on ha not the right to let on red blous drag upon them on ha
no right to slyli encumb with on miseri the happi of other
it is hideou to approach those who ar healthi and to touch them in
the dark with on ulcer in spite of the fact that fauchelev lent
me hi name i have no right to us it he could give it to me but i
could not take it a name is an i you see sir that i have thought
somewhat i have read a littl although i am a peasant and you see
that i express myself properli i understand thing i have procur
myself an educ well ye to abstract a name and to place oneself
under it is dishonest letter of the alphabet can be filch like a
purs or a watch to be a fals signatur in flesh and blood to be a
live fals kei to enter the hous of honest peopl by pick their
lock never more to look straightforward to forev ey askanc to be
infam within the i no no no no no it is better to suffer to
bleed to weep to tear on skin from the flesh with on nail to
pass night writh in anguish to devour oneself bodi and soul that
is why i have just told you all thi wantonli as you sai
he drew a pain breath and hurl thi final word
in dai gone by i stole a loaf of bread in order to live todai in
order to live i will not steal a name

live
ah i understand the matter said jean valjean rais and lower
hi head sever time in success
a silenc ensu both held their peac each plung in a gulf of
thought mariu wa sit near a tabl and rest the corner of hi
mouth on on of hi finger which wa fold back jean valjean wa
pace to and fro he paus befor a mirror and remain motionless
then as though repli to some inward cours of reason he said
as he gaze at the mirror which he did not see
while at present i am reliev
he took up hi march again and walk to the other end of the
drawingroom at the moment when he turn round he perceiv that
mariu wa watch hi walk then he said with an inexpress
inton

her is it not enough that you should know it i have been abl to sai
it myself without be forc to it i could have told it to the
univers to the whole worldit wa all on to me but she she doe
not know what it is it would terrifi her what a convict we should
be oblig to explain matter to her to sai to her he is a man who
ha been in the gallei she saw the chaingang pass by on dai oh
my god he drop into an armchair and hid hi face in hi
hand
hi grief wa not audibl but from the quiver of hi shoulder it
wa evid that he wa weep silent tear terribl tear
there is someth of suffoc in the sob he wa seiz with a sort
of convuls he threw himself against the back of the chair as though
to gain breath let hi arm fall and allow mariu to see hi
face inund with tear and mariu heard him murmur so low that hi
voic seem to issu from fathomless depth
oh would that i could die
be at your eas said mariu i will keep your secret for myself
alon
and less touch perhap than he ought to have been but forc for
the last hour to familiar himself with someth as unexpect as
it wa dread gradual behold the convict superpos befor hi
veri ey upon m fauchelev overcom littl by littl by that
lugubri realiti and led by the natur inclin of the
situat to recogn the space which had just been place between
that man and himself mariu ad
it is imposs that i should not speak a word to you with regard to
the deposit which you have so faithfulli and honestli remit that is
an act of probiti it is just that some recompens should be bestow
on you fix the sum yourself it shall be count out to you do not
fear to set it veri high
i thank you sir repli jean valjean gentli
he remain in thought for a moment mechan pass the tip of
hi forefing across hi thumbnail then he lift up hi voic
all is nearli over but on last thing remain for me
what is it
jean valjean struggl with what seem a last hesit and without
voic without breath he stammer rather than said
now that you know do you think sir you who ar the master that i
ought not to see cosett ani more
i think that would be better repli mariu coldli
i shall never see her more murmur jean valjean and he direct
hi step toward the door
he laid hi hand on the knob the latch yield the door open jean
valjean push it open far enough to pass through stood motionless for
a second then close the door again and turn to mariu
he wa no longer pale he wa livid there were no longer ani tear in
hi ey but onli a sort of tragic flame hi voic had regain a
strang composur
stai sir he said if you will allow it i will come to see her i
assur you that i desir it greatli if i had not care to see cosett
i should not have made to you the confess that i have made i should
have gone awai but as i desir to remain in the place where cosett
is and to continu to see her i had to tell you about it honestli
you follow my reason do you not it is a matter easili understood
you see i have had her with me for more than nine year we live
first in that hut on the boulevard then in the convent then near the
luxembourg that wa where you saw her for the first time you rememb
her blue plush hat then we went to the quartier de invalid where
there wa a rail on a garden the rue plumet i live in a littl
back courtyard whenc i could hear her piano that wa my life we
never left each other that last for nine year and some month i
wa like her own father and she wa my child i do not know whether
you understand monsieur pontmerci but to go awai now never to see
her again never to speak to her again to no longer have anyth
would be hard if you do not disapprov of it i will come to see
cosett from time to time i will not come often i will not remain
long you shall give order that i am to be receiv in the littl
waitingroom on the ground floor i could enter perfectli well by the
back door but that might creat surpris perhap and it would be
better i think for me to enter by the usual door truli sir i
should like to see a littl more of cosett as rare as you pleas
put yourself in my place i have noth left but that and then we
must be cautiou if i no longer come at all it would produc a bad
effect it would be consid singular what i can do by the wai is
to come in the afternoon when night is begin to fall
you shall come everi even said mariu and cosett will be
wait for you
you ar kind sir said jean valjean
mariu salut jean valjean happi escort despair to the door
and these two men part
chapter iith obscur which a revel can contain
mariu wa quit upset
the sort of estrang which he had alwai felt toward the man
besid whom he had seen cosett wa now explain to him there wa
someth enigmat about that person of which hi instinct had warn
him
thi enigma wa the most hideou of disgrac the gallei thi m
fauchelev wa the convict jean valjean
to abruptli find such a secret in the midst of on happi
resembl the discoveri of a scorpion in a nest of turtledov
wa the happi of mariu and cosett thenceforth condemn to such a
neighborhood wa thi an accomplish fact did the accept of that
man form a part of the marriag now consumm wa there noth to
be done
had mariu wed the convict as well
in vain mai on be crown with light and joi in vain mai on tast
the grand purpl hour of life happi love such shock would forc even
the archangel in hi ecstasi even the demigod in hi glori to
shudder
as is alwai the case in chang of view of thi natur mariu ask
himself whether he had noth with which to reproach himself had he
been want in divin had he been want in prudenc had he
involuntarili dull hi wit a littl perhap had he enter upon
thi love affair which had end in hi marriag to cosett without
take suffici precaut to throw light upon the surround he
admittedit is thu by a seri of success admiss of ourselv
in regard to ourselv that life amend us littl by littleh
admit the chimer and visionari side of hi natur a sort of
intern cloud peculiar to mani organ and which in paroxysm
of passion and sorrow dilat as the temperatur of the soul chang
and invad the entir man to such a degre as to render him noth
more than a conscienc bath in a mist we have more than onc
indic thi characterist element of mariu individu
he recal that in the intox of hi love in the rue plumet
dure those six or seven ecstat week he had not even spoken to
cosett of that drama in the gorbeau hovel where the victim had taken
up such a singular line of silenc dure the struggl and the ensu
flight how had it happen that he had not mention thi to cosett
yet it wa so near and so terribl how had it come to pass that he had
not even name the thnardier and particularli on the dai when he
had encount ponin he now found it almost difficult to explain
hi silenc of that time nevertheless he could account for it he
recal hi benumb state hi intox with cosett love
absorb everyth that catch awai of each other into the ideal
and perhap also like the impercept quantiti of reason mingl
with thi violent and charm state of the soul a vagu dull
instinct impel him to conceal and abolish in hi memori that
redoubt adventur contact with which he dread in which he did
not wish to plai ani part hi agenc in which he had kept secret and
in which he could be neither narrat nor wit without be an
accus
moreov these few week had been a flash of lightn there had been
no time for anyth except love
in short have weigh everyth turn everyth over in hi
mind examin everyth whatev might have been the consequ if
he had told cosett about the gorbeau ambush even if he had discov
that jean valjean wa a convict would that have chang him mariu
would that have chang her cosett would he have drawn back would
he have ador her ani the less would he have refrain from marri
her no then there wa noth to regret noth with which he need
reproach himself all wa well there is a deiti for those drunken men
who ar call lover mariu blind had follow the path which he
would have chosen had he been in full possess of hi sight love had
bandag hi ey in order to lead him whither to paradis
but thi paradis wa henceforth complic with an infern
accompani
mariu ancient estrang toward thi man toward thi
fauchelev who had turn into jean valjean wa at present mingl
with horror
in thi horror let us state there wa some piti and even a certain
surpris
thi thief thi thief guilti of a second offenc had restor that
deposit and what a deposit six hundr thousand franc
he alon wa in the secret of that deposit he might have kept it all
he had restor it all
moreov he had himself reveal hi situat noth forc him to
thi if ani on learn who he wa it wa through himself in thi
avow there wa someth more than accept of humili there
wa accept of peril for a condemn man a mask is not a mask it
is a shelter a fals name is secur and he had reject that fals
name he the galleyslav might have hidden himself forev in an
honest famili he had withstood thi temptat and with what motiv
through a conscienti scrupl he himself explain thi with the
irresist accent of truth in short whatev thi jean valjean
might be he wa undoubtedli a conscienc which wa awaken there
exist some mysteri rehabilit which had begun and to all
appear scrupl had for a long time alreadi control thi man
such fit of justic and good ar not characterist of vulgar
natur an awaken of conscienc is grandeur of soul
jean valjean wa sincer thi sincer visibl palpabl
irrefrag evid from the veri grief that it caus him render
inquiri useless and confer author on all that that man had
said
here for mariu there wa a strang revers of situat what
breath from m fauchelev distrust what did jean valjean inspir
confid
in the mysteri balanc of thi jean valjean which the pensiv mariu
struck he admit the activ principl he admit the passiv
principl and he tri to reach a balanc
but all thi went on as in a storm mariu while endeavor to form a
clear idea of thi man and while pursu jean valjean so to speak
in the depth of hi thought lost him and found him again in a fatal
mist
the deposit honestli restor the probiti of the confessionthes were
good thi produc a lighten of the cloud then the cloud becam
black onc more
troubl as were mariu memori a shadow of them return to him
after all what wa that adventur in the jondrett attic why had that
man taken to flight on the arriv of the polic instead of enter a
complaint
here mariu found the answer becaus that man wa a fugit from
justic who had broken hi ban
anoth question why had that man come to the barricad
for mariu now onc more distinctli beheld that recollect which had
reappear in hi emot like sympathet ink at the applic of
heat thi man had been in the barricad he had not fought there what
had he come there for in the presenc of thi question a spectr
sprang up and repli javert
mariu recal perfectli now that funer sight of jean valjean
drag the pinion javert out of the barricad and he still heard
behind the corner of the littl rue mondtour that fright pistol
shot obvious there wa hatr between that polic spy and the
galleyslav the on wa in the other wai jean valjean had gone to
the barricad for the purpos of reveng himself he had arriv
late he probabl knew that javert wa a prison there the corsican
vendetta ha penetr to certain lower strata and ha becom the law
there it is so simpl that it doe not astonish soul which ar but
half turn toward good and those heart ar so constitut that a
crimin who is in the path of repent mai be scrupul in the
matter of theft and unscrupul in the matter of vengeanc jean
valjean had kill javert at least that seem to be evid
thi wa the final question to be sure but to thi there wa no
repli thi question mariu felt like pincer how had it come to pass
that jean valjean exist had elbow that of cosett for so long a
period
what melancholi sport of provid wa that which had place that
child in contact with that man ar there then chain for two which ar
forg on high and doe god take pleasur in coupl the angel with
the demon so a crime and an innoc can be roommat in the
mysteri gallei of wretched in that defil of condemn
person which is call human destini can two brow pass side by side
the on ingenu the other formid the on all bath in the
divin white of dawn the other forev blemish by the flash of
an etern lightn who could have arrang that inexplic pair
off in what manner in consequ of what prodigi had ani commun
of life been establish between thi celesti littl creatur and
that old crimin
who could have bound the lamb to the wolf and what wa still more
incomprehens have attach the wolf to the lamb for the wolf
love the lamb for the fierc creatur ador the feebl on for
dure the space of nine year the angel had had the monster as her
point of support cosett childhood and girlhood her advent in the
daylight her virgin growth toward life and light had been
shelter by that hideou devot here question exfoli so to
speak into innumer enigma abyss yawn at the bottom of
abyss and mariu could no longer bend over jean valjean without
becom dizzi what wa thi manprecipic
the old symbol of genesi ar etern in human societi such as it
now exist and until a broader dai shall effect a chang in it there
will alwai be two men the on superior the other subterranean the
on which is accord to good is abel the other which is accord to
evil is cain what wa thi tender cain what wa thi ruffian
religi absorb in the ador of a virgin watch over her
rear her guard her dignifi her and envelop her impur
as he wa himself with puriti
what wa that cesspool which had vener that innoc to such a
point as not to leav upon it a singl spot what wa thi jean valjean
educ cosett what wa thi figur of the shadow which had for
it onli object the preserv of the rise of a star from everi
shadow and from everi cloud
that wa jean valjean secret that wa also god secret
in the presenc of thi doubl secret mariu recoil the on in
some sort reassur him as to the other god wa as visibl in thi
affair as wa jean valjean god ha hi instrument he make us of
the tool which he will he is not respons to men do we know how
god set about the work jean valjean had labor over cosett he had
to some extent made that soul that wa incontest well what
then the workman wa horribl but the work wa admir god
produc hi miracl as seem good to him he had construct that
charm cosett and he had emploi jean valjean it had pleas him
to choos thi strang collabor for himself what account have we
to demand of him is thi the first time that the dungheap ha aid
the spring to creat the rose
mariu made himself these repli and declar to himself that thei
were good he had not dare to press jean valjean on all the point
which we have just indic but he did not confess to himself that he
did not dare to do it he ador cosett he possess cosett cosett
wa splendidli pure that wa suffici for him what enlighten
did he need cosett wa a light doe light requir enlighten he
had everyth what more could he desir alli not that enough
jean valjean person affair did not concern him
and bend over the fatal shadow of that man he clung fast
convuls to the solemn declar of that unhappi wretch i am
noth to cosett ten year ago i did not know that she wa in
exist
jean valjean wa a passerbi he had said so himself well he had
pass whatev he wa hi part wa finish
henceforth there remain mariu to fulfil the part of provid to
cosett cosett had sought the azur in a person like herself in her
lover her husband her celesti male cosett as she took her
flight wing and transfigur left behind her on the earth her
hideou and empti chrysali jean valjean
in whatev circl of idea mariu revolv he alwai return to a
certain horror for jean valjean a sacr horror perhap for as we
have just point out he felt a quid divinum in that man but do
what he would and seek what extenu he would he wa certainli
forc to fall back upon thi the man wa a convict that is to sai a
be who ha not even a place in the social ladder sinc he is lower
than the veri lowest rung after the veri last of men come the
convict the convict is no longer so to speak in the semblanc of the
live the law ha depriv him of the entir quantiti of human of
which it can depriv a man
mariu on penal question still held to the inexor system though
he wa a democrat and he entertain all the idea of the law on the
subject of those whom the law strike he had not yet accomplish all
progress we admit he had not yet come to distinguish between that
which is written by man and that which is written by god between law
and right he had not examin and weigh the right which man take to
dispos of the irrevoc and the irrepar he wa not shock by
the word vindict he found it quit simpl that certain breach of
the written law should be follow by etern suffer and he
accept as the process of civil social damnat he still
stood at thi point though safe to advanc infal later on sinc
hi natur wa good and at bottom wholli form of latent progress
in thi stage of hi idea jean valjean appear to him hideou and
repuls he wa a man reprov he wa the convict that word wa for
him like the sound of the trump on the dai of judgment and after
have reflect upon jean valjean for a long time hi final gestur
had been to turn awai hi head vade retro
mariu if we must recogn and even insist upon the fact while
interrog jean valjean to such a point that jean valjean had said
you ar confess me had not nevertheless put to him two or three
decis question
it wa not that thei had not present themselv to hi mind but that
he had been afraid of them the jondrett attic the barricad javert
who know where these revel would have stop jean valjean did
not seem like a man who would draw back and who know whether mariu
after have urg him on would not have himself desir to hold him
back
ha it not happen to all of us in certain suprem conjunctur to
stop our ear in order that we mai not hear the repli after we have
ask a question it is especi when on love that on give wai to
these exhibit of cowardic it is not wise to question sinist
situat to the last point particularli when the indissolubl side
of our life is fatal intermingl with them what a terribl light
might have proceed from the despair explan of jean valjean
and who know whether that hideou glare would not have dart forth as
far as cosett who know whether a sort of infern glow would not
have linger behind it on the brow of that angel the spatter of a
lightningflash is of the thunder also fatal ha point of junctur
where innoc itself is stamp with crime by the gloomi law of the
reflect which give color the purest figur mai forev preserv
the reflect of a horribl associ rightli or wrongli mariu
had been afraid he alreadi knew too much he sought to dull hi sens
rather than to gain further light
in dismai he bore off cosett in hi arm and shut hi ey to jean
valjean
that man wa the night the live and horribl night how should he
dare to seek the bottom of it it is a terribl thing to interrog
the shadow who know what it repli will be the dawn mai be blacken
forev by it
in thi state of mind the thought that that man would henceforth come
into ani contact whatev with cosett wa a heartrend perplex to
mariu
he now almost reproach himself for not have put those formid
question befor which he had recoil and from which an implac
and definit decis might have sprung he felt that he wa too
good too gentl too weak if we must sai the word thi weak had
led him to an imprud concess he had allow himself to be
touch he had been in the wrong he ought to have simpli and pure
reject jean valjean jean valjean plai the part of fire and that
is what he should have done and have freed hi hous from that man
he wa vex with himself he wa angri with that whirlwind of emot
which had deafen blind and carri him awai he wa displeas
with himself
what wa he to do now jean valjean visit were profoundli repugn
to him what wa the us in have that man in hi hous what did the
man want here he becam dismai he did not wish to dig down he did
not wish to penetr deepli he did not wish to sound himself he had
promis he had allow himself to be drawn into a promis jean
valjean held hi promis on must keep on word even to a convict
abov all to a convict still hi first duti wa to cosett in short
he wa carri awai by the repugn which domin him
mariu turn over all thi confus of idea in hi mind pass
from on to the other and move by all of them henc aros a profound
troubl
it wa not easi for him to hide thi troubl from cosett but love is
a talent and mariu succeed in do it
howev without ani appar object he question cosett who wa as
candid as a dove is white and who suspect noth he talk of her
childhood and her youth and he becam more and more convinc that
that convict had been everyth good patern and respect that a
man can be toward cosett all that mariu had caught a glimps of and
had surmis wa real that sinist nettl had love and protect
that lili

let us sai howev that the reader would do wrong were he to blame
mariu
mariu as we have explain befor hi marriag had put no question
to m fauchelev and sinc that time he had fear to put ani to
jean valjean he had regret the promis into which he had allow
himself to be drawn he had often said to himself that he had done
wrong in make that concess to despair he had confin himself to
gradual estrang jean valjean from hi hous and to effac him
as much as possibl from cosett mind he had in a manner alwai
place himself between cosett and jean valjean sure that in thi
wai she would not perceiv nor think of the latter it wa more than
effac it wa an eclips
mariu did what he consid necessari and just he thought that he
had seriou reason which the reader ha alreadi seen and other which
will be seen later on for get rid of jean valjean without
harsh but without weak
chanc have ordain that he should encount in a case which he had
argu a former employe of the laffitt establish he had
acquir mysteri inform without seek it which he had not
been abl it is true to probe out of respect for the secret which he
had promis to guard and out of consider for jean valjean
peril posit he believ at that moment that he had a grave duti
to perform the restitut of the six hundr thousand franc to some
on whom he sought with all possibl discret in the meanwhil he
abstain from touch that monei
as for cosett she had not been initi into ani of these secret
but it would be harsh to condemn her also
there exist between mariu and her an allpow magnet which
caus her to do instinct and almost mechan what mariu
wish she wa consciou of mariu will in the direct of monsieur
jean she conform to it her husband had not been oblig to sai
anyth to her she yield to the vagu but clear pressur of hi
tacit intent and obei blindli her obedi in thi instanc
consist in not rememb what mariu forgot she wa not oblig to
make ani effort to accomplish thi without her know why herself
and without hi have ani caus to accus her of it her soul had
becom so wholli her husband that that which wa shroud in gloom in
mariu mind becam overcast in her
let us not go too far howev in what concern jean valjean thi
forget and obliter were mere superfici she wa rather
heedless than forget at bottom she wa sincer attach to the
man whom she had so long call her father but she love her husband
still more dearli thi wa what had somewhat disturb the balanc of
her heart which lean to on side onli
it sometim happen that cosett spoke of jean valjean and express
her surpris then mariu calm her he is absent i think did not
he sai that he wa set out on a journeythat is true thought
cosett he had a habit of disappear in thi fashion but not for
so long two or three time she despatch nicolett to inquir in the
rue de lhomm arm whether m jean had return from hi journei jean
valjean caus the answer no to be given
cosett ask noth more sinc she had but on need on earth
mariu
let us also sai that on their side cosett and mariu had also been
absent thei had been to vernon mariu had taken cosett to hi
father grave
mariu gradual won cosett awai from jean valjean cosett allow

and mariu drew a banknot from hi pocket and flung it in hi face
thank pardon me five hundr franc monsieur le baron
and the man overcom bow seiz the note and examin it
five hundr franc he began again taken aback and he stammer in
a low voic an honest rustler69
then brusqu
well so be it he exclaim let us put ourselv at our eas
and with the agil of a monkei fling back hi hair tear off
hi spectacl and withdraw from hi nose by sleight of hand the
two quill of which mention wa recent made and which the reader ha
also met with on anoth page of thi book he took off hi face as the
man take off hi hat
hi ey light up hi uneven brow with hollow in some place and
bump in other hideous wrinkl at the top wa laid bare hi nose
had becom as sharp as a beak the fierc and sagaci profil of the
man of prei reappear
monsieur le baron is infal he said in a clear voic whenc all
nasal twang had disappear i am thnardier
and he straighten up hi crook back
thnardier for it wa realli he wa strang surpris he would
have been troubl had he been capabl of such a thing he had come to
bring astonish and it wa he who had receiv it thi humili
had been worth five hundr franc to him and take it all in all
he accept it but he wa nonetheless bewild
he beheld thi baron pontmerci for the first time and in spite of hi
disguis thi baron pontmerci recogn him and recogn him
thoroughli and not onli wa thi baron perfectli inform as to
thnardier but he seem well post as to jean valjean who wa thi
almost beardless young man who wa so glacial and so gener who
knew peopl name who knew all their name and who open hi purs
to them who bulli rascal like a judg and who paid them like a
dupe
thnardier the reader will rememb although he had been mariu
neighbor had never seen him which is not unusu in pari he had
formerli in a vagu wai heard hi daughter talk of a veri poor young
man name mariu who live in the hous he had written to him without
know him the letter with which the reader is acquaint
no connect between that mariu and m le baron pontmerci wa
possibl in hi mind
as for the name pontmerci it will be recal that on the battlefield
of waterloo he had onli heard the last two syllabl for which he
alwai entertain the legitim scorn which on ow to what is
mere an express of thank
howev through hi daughter azelma who had start on the scent of
the marri pair on the 16th of februari and through hi own person
research he had succeed in learn mani thing and from the
depth of hi own gloom he had contriv to grasp more than on
mysteri clew he had discov by dint of industri or at least
by dint of induct he had guess who the man wa whom he had
encount on a certain dai in the grand sewer from the man he had
easili reach the name he knew that madam la baronn pontmerci wa
cosett but he meant to be discreet in that quarter
who wa cosett he did not know exactli himself he did inde catch
an inkl of illegitimaci the histori of fantin had alwai seem to
him equivoc but what wa the us of talk about that in order to
caus himself to be paid for hi silenc he had or thought he had
better ware than that for sale and accord to all appear if
he were to come and make to the baron pontmerci thi revelationand
without proof your wife is a bastard the onli result would be to
attract the boot of the husband toward the loin of the reveal
from thnardier point of view the convers with mariu had not
yet begun he ought to have drawn back to have modifi hi strategi
to have abandon hi posit to have chang hi front but noth
essenti had been compromis as yet and he had five hundr franc
in hi pocket moreov he had someth decis to sai and even
against thi veri wellinform and wellarm baron pontmerci he felt
himself strong for men of thnardier natur everi dialogu is a
combat in the on in which he wa about to engag what wa hi
situat he did not know to whom he wa speak but he did know of
what he wa speak he made thi rapid review of hi inner forc
and after have said i am thnardier he wait
mariu had becom thought so he had hold of thnardier at last
that man whom he had so greatli desir to find wa befor him he
could honor colonel pontmerci recommend
he felt humili that that hero should have own anyth to thi
villain and that the letter of chang drawn from the depth of the
tomb by hi father upon him mariu had been protest up to that dai
it also seem to him in the complex state of hi mind toward
thnardier that there wa occas to aveng the colonel for the
misfortun of have been save by such a rascal in ani case he wa
content he wa about to deliv the colonel shade from thi unworthi
creditor at last and it seem to him that he wa on the point of
rescu hi father memori from the debtor prison by the side of
thi duti there wa anotherto elucid if possibl the sourc of
cosett fortun the opportun appear to present itself perhap
thnardier knew someth it might prove us to see the bottom of
thi man
he commenc with thi
thnardier had caus the honest rustler to disappear in hi fob and
wa gaze at mariu with a gentl that wa almost tender
mariu broke the silenc
thnardier i have told you your name now would you like to have me
tell you your secretth on that you came here to reveal to me i have
inform of my own also you shall see that i know more about it
than you do jean valjean as you have said is an assassin and a
thief a thief becaus he rob a wealthi manufactur whose ruin he
brought about an assassin becaus he assassin policeag
javert
i dont understand sir ejacul thnardier
i will make myself intellig in a certain arrondiss of the
pa de calai there wa in 1822 a man who had fallen out with
justic and who under the name of m madelein had regain hi
statu and rehabilit himself thi man had becom a just man in the
full forc of the term in a trade the manufactur of black glass
good he made the fortun of an entir citi as far as hi person
fortun wa concern he made that also but as a secondari matter and
in some sort by accid he wa the fosterfath of the poor he
found hospit open school visit the sick dower young
girl support widow and adopt orphan he wa like the guardian
angel of the countri he refus the cross he wa appoint mayor a
liber convict knew the secret of a penalti incur by thi man in
former dai he denounc him and had him arrest and profit by
the arrest to come to pari and caus the banker laffittei have the
fact from the cashier himselfbi mean of a fals signatur to hand
over to him the sum of over half a million which belong to m
madelein thi convict who rob m madelein wa jean valjean as
for the other fact you have noth to tell me about it either jean
valjean kill the agent javert he shot him with a pistol i the
person who is speak to you wa present
thnardier cast upon mariu the sovereign glanc of a conquer man who
lai hi hand onc more upon the victori and who ha just regain in
on instant all the ground which he ha lost but the smile return
instantli the inferior triumph in the presenc of hi superior must
be wheedl
thnardier content himself with sai to mariu
monsieur le baron we ar on the wrong track
and he emphas thi phrase by make hi bunch of seal execut an
express whirl
what broke forth mariu do you disput that these ar fact
thei ar chimra the confid with which monsieur le baron honor
me render it my duti to tell him so truth and justic befor all
thing i do not like to see folk accus unjustli monsieur le baron
jean valjean did not rob m madelein and jean valjean did not kill
javert
thi is too much how is thi
for two reason
what ar thei speak
thi is the first he did not rob m madelein becaus it is jean
valjean himself who wa m madelein
what tale ar you tell me
and thi is the second he did not assassin javert becaus the
person who kill javert wa javert
what do you mean to sai
that javert commit suicid
prove it prove it cri mariu besid himself
thnardier resum scan hi phrase after the manner of the ancient
alexandrin measur
policeagentjavertwasfounddrownedunderaboatofthepontau
chang
but prove it
thnardier drew from hi pocket a larg envelop of grai paper which
seem to contain sheet fold in differ size
i have my paper he said calmli
and he ad
monsieur le baron in your interest i desir to know jean valjean
thoroughli i sai that jean valjean and m madelein ar on and the
same man and i sai that javert had no other assassin than javert if i
speak it is becaus i have proof not manuscript proofswrit is
suspici handwrit is complaisantbut print proof
as he spoke thnardier extract from the envelop two copi of
newspap yellow fade and strongli satur with tobacco on of
these two newspap broken at everi fold and fall into rag
seem much older than the other
two fact two proof remark thnardier and he offer the two
newspap unfold to mariu
the reader is acquaint with these two paper on the most ancient
a number of the drapeau blanc of the 25th of juli 1823 the text of
which can be seen in the first volum establish the ident of m
madelein and jean valjean
the other a moniteur of the 15th of june 1832 announc the
suicid of javert ad that it appear from a verbal report of
javert to the prefect that have been taken prison in the barricad
of the rue de la chanvreri he had ow hi life to the magnanim of
an insurg who hold him under hi pistol had fire into the air
instead of blow out hi brain
mariu read he had evid a certain date irrefrag proof these
two newspap had not been print expressli for the purpos of
back up thnardier statement the note print in the moniteur
had been an administr commun from the prefectur of polic
mariu could not doubt
the inform of the cashierclerk had been fals and he himself had
been deceiv
jean valjean who had suddenli grown grand emerg from hi cloud
mariu could not repress a cry of joi
well then thi unhappi wretch is an admir man the whole of that
fortun realli belong to him he is madelein the provid of a
whole countrysid he is jean valjean javert savior he is a hero
he is a saint
he not a saint and he not a hero said thnardier he an
assassin and a robber
and he ad in the tone of a man who begin to feel that he possess
some author
let us be calm
robber assassinthos word which mariu thought had disappear and
which return fell upon him like an icecold showerbath
again said he
alwai ejacul thnardier jean valjean did not rob madelein
but he is a thief he did not kill javert but he is a murder
will you speak retort mariu of that miser theft commit
forti year ago and expiat as your own newspap prove by a whole
life of repent of selfabneg and of virtu

unknown it belong to unpublish matter and perhap you will find in
it the sourc of the fortun so skilfulli present to madam la

natur it would not be so veri unskil to slip into an honor
hous whose comfort on would then share and at the same stroke to
conceal on crime and to enjoi on theft to buri on name and
to creat for oneself a famili

troubl to get thi on
that done he cross hi leg and stretch himself out on the back of

such a thing as for the theft that is understood on doe not kill a
man grati thi convict wa on hi wai to fling the bodi into the
river on fact is to be notic that befor reach the exit
grate thi convict who had come a long distanc in the sewer must
necessarili have encount a fright quagmir where it seem as
though he might have left the bodi but the sewermen would have found
the assassin man the veri next dai while at work on the quagmir
and that did not suit the assassin plan he had prefer to
travers that quagmir with hi burden and hi exert must have
been terribl for it is imposs to risk on life more complet
i dont understand how he could have come out of that aliv
mariu chair approach still nearer thnardier took advantag of

you ar right sir when you tell me that le misrabl is written
for all nation i do not know whether it will be read by all but i
wrote it for all it is address to england as well as to spain to
itali as well as to franc to germani as well as to ireland to
republ which have slave as well as to empir which have serf
social problem overstep frontier the sore of the human race those
great sore which cover the globe do not halt at the red or blue line
trace upon the map in everi place where man is ignor and
despair in everi place where woman is sold for bread wherev the
child suffer for lack of the book which should instruct him and of the
hearth which should warm him the book of le misrabl knock at
the door and sai open to me i come for you
at the hour of civil through which we ar now pass and which
is still so sombr the miser name is man he is agon in
all clime and he is groan in all languag
your itali is no more exempt from the evil than is our franc your
admir itali ha all miseri on the face of it doe not bandit

doe not prevent rag on man
like us you have prejudic superstit tyranni fanatic
blind law lend assist to ignor custom you tast noth of
the present nor of the futur without a flavor of the past be
mingl with it you have a barbarian the monk and a savag the
lazzaron the social question is the same for you as for us there ar
a few less death from hunger with you and a few more from fever your
social hygien is not much better than our shadow which ar
protest in england ar cathol in itali but under differ
name the vescovo is ident with the bishop and it alwai
mean night and of pretti nearli the same qualiti to explain the
bibl badli amount to the same thing as to understand the gospel

extrem of fire upon garibaldi that is to sai upon the live honor
of itali let us subject your social order to examin let us take
it where it stand and as it stand let us view it flagrant offenc
show me the woman and the child it is by the amount of protect with
which these two feebl creatur ar surround that the degre of
civil is to be measur is prostitut less heartrend in
napl than in pari what is the amount of truth that spring from
your law and what amount of justic spring from your tribun do
you chanc to be so fortun as to be ignor of the mean of those
gloomi word public prosecut legal infami prison the scaffold

from the depth of the gloom wherein you dwell you do not see much
more distinctli than we the radiant and distant portal of eden onli
the priest ar mistaken these holi portal ar befor and not behind

i resum thi book le misrabl is no less your mirror than
our certain men certain cast rise in revolt against thi booki
understand that mirror those reveal of the truth ar hate that
doe not prevent them from be of us
as for myself i have written for all with a profound love for my own
countri but without be engross by franc more than by ani other
nation in proport as i advanc in life i grow more simpl and i
becom more and more patriot for human
thi is moreov the tendenc of our ag and the law of radianc of
the french revolut book must ceas to be exclus french
italian german spanish or english and becom european i sai more
human if thei ar to correspond to the enlarg of civil
henc a new logic of art and of certain requir of composit
which modifi everyth even the condit formerli narrow of tast
and languag which must grow broader like all the rest
in franc certain critic have reproach me to my great delight
with have transgress the bound of what thei call french tast i
should be glad if thi eulogium were merit
in short i am do what i can i suffer with the same univers
suffer and i try to assuag it i possess onli the puni forc of a
man and i cry to all help me
thi sir is what your letter prompt me to sai i sai it for you and
for your countri if i have insist so strongli it is becaus of on
phrase in your letter you write
there ar italian and thei ar numer who sai thi book le
misrabl is a french book it doe not concern us let the french
read it as a histori we read it as a romanceala i repeat
whether we be italian or frenchmen miseri concern us all ever sinc

ha been the garment of the human race the moment ha at length
arriv for tear off that rag and for replac upon the nake
