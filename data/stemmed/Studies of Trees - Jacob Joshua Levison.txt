befor the public it is believ howev that there is still need for
an allround book adapt to the beginn which give in a brief and
not too technic wai the most import fact concern the
identif structur and us of our more common tree and which
consid their habit enemi and care both when grow alon and
when grow in group or forest
in the chapter on the identif of tree the aim ha been to
bring befor the student onli such charact and fact as shall help
him to distinguish the tree readili dure all season of the year
special stress is laid in each case on the most strike peculiar
possibl confus with other tree of similar appear is prevent
as far as possibl through comparison with tree of like form or habit
onli such inform is given concern the structur and requir
of tree as will enabl the reader better to understand the subsequ
chapter in the second half of the book practic applic is made
of the student gener knowledg thu acquir and he is acquaint
with the fundament principl of plant care forestri wood
identif and natur studi
the author recogn the vast of the field he is attempt to
cover and the imposs of even touch in a small handbook of
thi charact on everi phase of tree studi he presum no further
yet he hope that by adher to what is salient and by elimin the
less import though possibl interest fact he is abl to offer
a gener and elementari rsum of the whole subject of valu to
student privat owner farmer and teacher

introduct
a good mani popular book on tree have been publish in the unit
state in recent year the continu increas demand for book of
thi charact indic the grow public interest not onli in the
tree that we pass in our daili walk but also in the forest consid
as a commun of tree becaus of it aesthet and protect valu
and it us as a sourc of import econom product
as a nation we ar think more about tree and wood than we were
wont to do in the year gone by we ar grow to love the tree and
forest as we turn more and more to outdoor life for recreat and
sport in our rambl along shadi street through grassi park over
wood vallei and in mountain wilder we find that much more than
formerli we ar ask ourselv what ar these tree what ar the
leaf flower twig wood and habit characterist which distinguish
them from other tree how larg do thei grow under what condit of
soil and climat do thei thrive best what ar their enemi and how can
thei be overcom what is their valu for wood and other us
product what is their protect valu ar thei us for plant
along street and in park and in regener forest how can the
tree of our street and lawn be preserv and repair as thei begin
to fail from old ag or other caus all these question and mani more
relat to the import nativ and exot tree commonli found in the
state east of the great lake and north of maryland mr levison ha
briefli answer in thi book the author train as a forest and
hi experi as a profession arboriculturist ha peculiarli fit
him to speak in an authorit and interest wai about tree and
wood
the valu of thi book is not in new knowledg but in the simpl
statement of the most import fact relat to some of our common
tree individu and collect consid a knowledg of tree
and forest add vastli to the pleasur of outdoor life the more we
studi tree and the more intim our knowledg of the forest as a unit
of veget in which each tree each flower each anim and insect
ha it part to plai in the complet structur the greater will be our

chapter i
how to identifi tree
there ar mani wai in which the problem of identifi tree mai be
approach the major attempt to recogn tree by their leaf
charact leaf charact howev do not differenti the tree
dure the other half of the year when thei ar bare in thi chapter
the character ar base as far as possibl on peculiar
that ar evid all year round in almost everi tree there is some on
trait that mark it individu and separ it at a glanc from
all other tree it mai be the gener form of the tree it mode of
branch bark bud or fruit it mai be some variat in color or in
case of the evergreen tree it mai be the number and posit of the
needl or leav the speci includ in the follow page have thu
been arrang in group base on these perman charact the
individu speci ar further describ by a distinguish paragraph
in which the main charact of the tree is emphas in heavi type
the last paragraph under each speci is also import becaus it
classifi all relat speci and distinguish those that ar liabl
to be confus with the particular tree under consider
group i the pine
illustr fig 1twig of the austrian pine
how to tell them from other tree the pine belong to the conifer
class of tree that is tree which bear cone the pine mai be
told from the other conifer tree by their leav which ar in
the form of needl two inch or more in length these needl
keep green throughout the entir year thi is characterist of all
conifer tree except the larch and cypress which shed their
leav in winter
illustr fig 2twig of the white pine
the pine ar wide distribut throughout the northern hemispher
and includ about 80 distinct speci with over 600 varieti the
speci enumer here ar especi common in the eastern part of
the unit state grow either nativ in the forest or under
cultiv in the park the pine form a veri import class of
timber tree and produc beauti effect when plant in group
in the park
how to tell them from each other the pine needl ar arrang in
cluster see fig 1 each speci ha a certain characterist
number of needl to the cluster and thi fact gener provid
the simplest and most direct wai of distinguish the differ
pine
in the white pine there ar five needl to each cluster in the
pitch pine three and in the scotch pine two the austrian pine
also ha two needl to the cluster but the differ in size and
charact of the needl will distinguish thi speci from the
scotch pine
the white pine pinu strobu
distinguish charact the tree can be told at close rang by the
number of needl to each cluster fig 2 there ar five needl
to each cluster of the white pine thei ar bluish green slender
and about four inch in length
at a distanc the tree mai be told by the right angl which the
branch form with the main trunk fig 3 no other pine show thi
charact
form and size a tall tree the stateliest of the evergreen
rang eastern north america
soil and locat prefer a deep sandi soil but will grow in almost
ani soil
enemi suck insect form white downi patch on the bark and
twig the white pine weevil a bore insect and the white pine
blister rust a fungu ar among it princip enemi
illustr fig 3the white pine
valu for plant asid from it valu as an ornament tree the
white pine is an excel tree to plant on abandon farm and for
woodland and windbreak throughout the new england state new
york pennsylvania and the lake state
commerci valu the wood is easili work light durabl and will
not warp it is us for naval construct lumber shingl
lath interior finish wooden ware etc
other charact the fruit is a cone four to six inch long
comparison the tree is apt to be confus with the bhotan pine
pinu excelsa which is commonli grown as an ornament tree
the bhotan pine howev ha needl much longer and more droop
in appear
the pitch pine pinu rigida
distinguish charact here there ar three needl to each
cluster fig 4 thei ar dark yellowishgreen needl about four
inch long the roughlook branch of the tree mai be seen
stud with cone throughout the year and cluster of leav
mai be seen sprout directli from the trunk of the tree see
fig 5 the last two ar veri characterist and will distinguish
the tree at a glanc
form and size it is a low tree of uncertain habit and extrem rough
look at everi stage of it life it is constantli full of dead
branch and old cone which persist on the tree throughout the
year
rang eastern unit state
soil and locat grow in the poorest and sandiest soil where few
other tree will grow in new jersei and on long island where it is
nativ it prove so hardi and persist that it often form pure
stand exclud other tree
illustr fig 4twig of the pitch pine
enemi none of import
valu for plant well adapt for the sea coast and other expos
place it is of extrem uncertain habit and is subject to the
loss of the lower limb it frequent present a certain
picturesqu of outlin but it could not be us as a specimen
tree on the lawn
illustr fig 5the pitch pine
commerci valu the wood is coars grain and is us for rough
lumber fuel and charcoal
other charact the fruit is a cone on to three
inch long persist on the tree for sever year
the scotch pine pinu sylvestri
distinguish charact there ar two needl to each cluster and
these ar short compar with those of the white pine and
slightli twist see fig 6 the bark especi along the
upper portion of the trunk is reddish in color
form and size a mediums tree with a short crown
rang europ asia and eastern unit state
soil and locat will do best on a deep rich sandi soil but will
also grow on a dry porou soil
enemi in europ the scotch pine ha sever insect enemi but in
america it appear to be free from injuri
valu for plant suitabl for windbreak and woodland plant mani
excel specimen mai also be found in our park
commerci valu in the unit state the wood is chiefli us for
fuel though slightli us for barrel box and carpentri in
europ the scotch pine is an import timber tree
comparison the scotch pine is apt to be confus with the austrian
pine pinu austriaca becaus thei both have two needl to
each cluster the needl of the austrian pine howev ar much
longer coarser straighter and darker than those of the scotch
pine fig 1 the form of the austrian pine too is more
symmetr and compact
illustr fig 6twig of the scotch pine
the red pine pinu resinosa is anoth tree that ha two
needl to each cluster but these ar much longer than those of the
scotch pine five to six inch and ar straighter the bark which
is reddish in color also differenti the red pine from the
austrian pine the posit of the cone on the red pine which
point outward and downward at matur will also help to
distinguish thi tree from the scotch and the austrian varieti
group ii the spruce and hemlock
how to tell them from other tree the spruce and hemlock belong to the
evergreen class and mai be told from the other tree by their
leav the characterist leav of the spruce ar shown in fig
9 those of the hemlock in fig 10 these ar much shorter than the
needl of the pine but ar longer than the leav of the red cedar
or arbor vita thei ar neither arrang in cluster like those of
the larch nor in featheri layer like those of the cypress thei
adher to the tree throughout the year while the leav of the
larch and cypress shed in the fall
the spruce ar pyramidalshap tree with tall and taper
trunk thickli cover with branch form a compact crown thei
ar wide distribut throughout the cold and temper region of
the northern hemispher where thei often form thick forest over
extend area
there ar eighteen recogn speci of spruce the norwai spruce
ha been chosen as a type for thi group becaus it is so commonli
plant in the northeastern part of the unit state
the hemlock is repres by seven speci confin to temper
north america japan and central and western china
illustr fig 7the norwai spruce
how to tell them from each other the needl and branch of the spruce
ar coars those of the hemlock ar flat and grace the
individu leav of the spruce fig 9 ar foursid and green or
blue on the under side while those of the hemlock fig 10 ar
flat and ar mark by two white line on the under side
the norwai spruce picea excelsa
distinguish charact the characterist appear of the
fullgrown tree is due to the droop branchlet carri on main
branch which bend upward fig 7
leaf the leav ar dark green in color and ar arrang spiral
thu make the twig coarser to the touch than the twig of the
hemlock or fir in crosssect the individu leaflet is
quadrilater while that of the pine is triangular

soil and locat grow in cool moist situat
enemi the foliag of the spruce is sometim affect by red
spider but is apt to be more serious injur by drought wind
and late frost
valu for plant commonli plant as an ornament tree and for
hedg it doe well for thi purpos in a cool northern climat
but in the vicin of new york citi and further south it doe not
do as well lose it lower branch at an earli ag and becom
gener scraggli in appear
illustr fig 8a group of hemlock
commerci valu the wood is light and soft and is us for
construct timber paper pulp and fuel
other charact the fruit is a larg slender cone four to seven
inch long
comparison the white spruce picea canadensi mai be told from
the norwai spruce by the whitish color on the under side of it
leav and the unpleas pungent odor emit from the needl
when bruis the cone of the white spruce about two inch long
ar shorter than these of the norwai spruce but ar longer than
those of the black spruce
it is essenti a northern tree grow in all sort of locat
along the stream and on rocki mountain slope as far north as the
arctic sea and alaska it often appear as an ornament tree as far
south as new york and pennsylvania
the black spruce picea mariana mai be told from the other
spruce by it small cone which is usual onli about on inch in
length in new england it seldom grow to as larg a size as the
other spruce tree
it cover larg area in variou part of northern north america and
grow to it largest size in manitoba the black spruce ha littl
valu as an ornament tree
the colorado blue spruce picea parryana or picea pungen
which is commonli us as an ornament tree on lawn and in park
can be told from the other spruce by it paleblu or sagegreen
color and it sharppoint coarsefeel twig it small size
and sharppoint conic form ar also characterist
it grow to a larg size in colorado and the middl west in the
eastern state and in northern europ where it is plant as an
ornament tree it is usual much smaller

state
soil and locat grow on all sort of soil in the deepest wood as
well as on high mountain slope
enemi none of import
valu for plant the hemlock make an excel hedg becaus it
retain it lowest branch and will stand shear in thi respect
it is prefer to the spruce it make a fair tree for the lawn
and is especi desir for underpl in woodland where
the shade from the surround tree is heavi in thi respect it is
like the beech
commerci valu the wood is soft brittl and coarsegrain and is
therefor us mainli for coars lumber it bark is so rich in
tannin that it form on of the chief commerci product of the
tree
other charact the fruit is a small cone about of an inch long
which gener hang on the tree all winter

group iii the red cedar and arborvita
how to tell them from other tree the red cedar junip and
arborvita mai be told from other tree by their leav which
remain on the tree and keep green throughout the entir year these
leav differ from those of the other evergreen in be much
shorter and of a distinct shape as shown in fig 12 and 13 the
tree themselv ar much smaller than the other evergreen
enumer in thi book altogeth there ar thirtyf speci
of junip recogn and four of arborvita the junip ar
wide distribut over the northern hemispher from the arctic
region down to mexico in the new world and in northern africa
china and japan in the old world the arborvita is found in
northeastern and northwestern america china and japan the speci
mention here ar those commonli found in america
how to tell them from each other the twig of the arborvita ar
flat and fanlik as in fig 13 the twig of the red cedar ar
needleshap or scalelik as in fig 12 the foliag of the
arborvita is of a lighter color than that of the red cedar which
is sombr green the arborvita will gener be found grow in
moist locat while the red cedar will grow in dry place as
well the arborvita gener retain it lower branch in open
place while the branch of the red cedar start at some distanc
from the ground

the structur and requir of tree
to be abl fulli to appreci tree their mode of life
their enemi and their care on must know someth of
their structur and life requir
structur of tree among the lower form of plant there is veri littl
distinct between the variou partsno differenti into root
stem or crown often the lower form of anim and veget life
ar so similar that on cannot discrimin between them but as we
ascend in the scale the variou plant form becom more and more
complex until we reach the tree which is the largest and highest
form of all plant the tree is a live organ compos of cell
like ani other live organ it ha mani part everi on of
which ha a definit purpos the three princip part ar the
stem the crown and the root
the stem if we examin the crosssect of a tree fig 86 we will
notic that it is made up of numer ring arrang in section of
differ color and structur the central part is known as the
pith around the pith come a dark closegrain seri of ring
known as the heartwood and outsid the heartwood come a lighter
layer the sapwood the cambium layer surround the sapwood and
the bark cover all the cambium layer is the most import
tissu of the tree and togeth with part of the sapwood
transport the water and food of the tree it is for thi reason
that a tree mai be hollow without heart and sapwood and still
produc foliag and fruit
illustr fig 86the crosssect of a tree
the crown the crown vari in form in differ speci and is
develop by the growth of new shoot from bud the bud grow out
to a certain length and form the branch afterward it thicken
onli and doe not increas in length new branch will then form
from other bud on the same branch thi explain in part the
characterist branch of tree fig 87
illustr fig 87characterist form and branch of tree
the tree in the photograph ar pin oak
the leav ar the stomach and lung of the tree their broad
blade ar a devic to catch the sunlight which is need in the
process of digest the food of the tree the leav ar arrang
on the twig in such a wai as to catch the most sunlight the leav
take up the carbon acid ga from the air decompos it under the
influenc of light and combin it with the miner and water
brought up by the root from the soil the result chemic
combin ar the sugar and starch us by the cambium layer
in build up the bodi of the tree a green pigment chlorophyl
in the leaf is the medium by which with the aid of sunlight the
sugar ar manufactur
illustr fig 88root of a hemlock tree in their search for
water
the chlorophyl give the leaf it green color and thi explain
why a tree pale when it is in a dy condit or when it life
process ar interf with the other color of the leafth
red brown and yellow of the fall or springar due to other
pigment these ar angular crystal of differ hue which at
certain time of the year becom more conspicu than at other a
phenomenon which explain the variat in the color of the leav
dure the differ season
it is evid that a tree is greatli depend upon it leav for
the manufactur of food and on can therefor readili see why it
is import to prevent destruct of the leav by insect or
through overtrim
the root the root develop in much the same manner as the crown it
depth and spread will vari with the speci but will also depend
somewhat upon the condit of the soil around it a deep or a dry
soil will tend to develop a deep root while a shallow or moist soil
will produc a shallow root fig 88
the numer fine hair which cover the root serv the purpos of
take up food and water from the soil while the heavi root help
to support the tree the roothair ar extrem tender ar easili
dri out when expos to the sun and wind and ar apt to becom
overh when permit to remain tightli pack for ani length of
time these consider ar of practic import in the
plant of tree and in the applic of fertil it is these
fine rootlet far awai from the trunk of the tree that have to be
fed and all fertil must therefor be appli at point some
distanc from the trunk and not close to it where mere the larg
support root ar locat in the cultiv of tree the same
principl hold true
requir of tree tree ar depend upon certain soil and
atmospher condit which influenc their growth and develop
1 influenc of moistur the form of the tree and it growth and
structur depend greatli upon the suppli of moistur botanist
have taken the moistur factor as the basi of classif and
have subdivid tree into those that grow in moist place
hydrophyt those that grow in medium soil mesophyt and
those that grow in dry place xerophyt water is taken up by
the root of the tree from the soil the liquid absorb by the
root carri in solut the miner saltsth food of the
treeand no food can be taken up unless it is in solut much of
the water is us by the tree and an enorm amount is given off in
the process of evapor
illustr fig 89dead branch at the top caus by insuffici
water
these fact will explain some of the fundament principl in the
care of tree to a tree grow on a citi street or on a lawn where
natur fail to suppli the requisit amount of water the latter
must be suppli artifici especi dure the hot summer
month or els dead branch mai result as seen in fig 89 too
much thin out of the crown caus excess evapor and too
much cut out in woodland caus the soil to dry and the tree
to suffer for the want of moistur thi also explain why it is
essenti in wood area to retain on the ground the fallen
leav in decompos and mix with the soil the fallen leav
not onli suppli the tree with food materi but also tend to
conserv moistur in the ground and to prevent the dry out of the
soil rake off the leav from wood area a practic common in
park and on privat estateshurt the tree serious some soil
mai have plenti of moistur but mai also be so heavili satur
with acid or salt that the tree cannot util the moistur and
it suffer from drought just the same as if there had been no
moistur at all in the soil such soil ar said to be
physiolog dry and need treatment
in the develop of diseas moistur is a contribut factor
and therefor in caviti or underneath bandag where there is
like to be an accumul of moistur decai will do more damag
than in place that ar dry and expos to the sun
2 influenc of soil soil is made up of fine particl of sand and
rock and of veget matter call humu a tree will requir a
certain soil and unsuit soil can be veri often modifi to
suit the need of the tree a deep moder loos sandi loam
howev which is suffici aerat and well suppli with
water will support almost ani tree too much of ani on constitu
will make a soil unfit for the product of tree if too much clai
is present the soil becom stiff if too much veget matter is
present the soil becom sour the physic charact of the soil
is also import by physic charact is meant the poros which
result from break up the soil thi is accomplish by plough
or cultiv in natur worm help to do thi for the soil but
on street an occasion dig up of the soil about the base of
the tree is essenti
humu or the organ matter in the soil is compos of litter
leav and anim ingredi that have decai under the influenc
of bacteria the more veget matter in the humu the darker the
soil and therefor a good soil such as on find on the upper
surfac of a welltil farm ha quit a dark color when howev
a soil contain an unusu quantiti of humu it is known as muck
and when there is still more humu present we find peat neither
of these two soil is suitabl for proper tree growth
illustr fig 90a tree in the open note the full develop
of the wide crown with branch start near the ground the tree is
the european larch
3 influenc of light light is requir by the leav in the process
of assimil cut off some of the light from a tree affect
it form thi is why tree grown in the open have widespread
crown with branch start near the ground as in fig 90 while
the same speci grow in the forest produc tall lanki tree
free from branch to but a few feet from the top as in fig 91
some tree can endur more shade than other but all will grow in
full light thi explain why tree like the beech hemlock sugar
mapl spruce holli and dogwood can grow in the shade while the
poplar birch and willow requir light it also explain why in
the forest the lower branch die and fall offa process known in
forestri as natur prune the influenc of light on the form of
tree should be well understood by all those who plant tree and by
those design landscap effect
illustr fig 91a tree in the forest note the tall stem free
from branch and the small narrow crown
4 influenc of heat tree requir a certain amount of heat thei
receiv it partli from the sun and partli from the soil evapor
prevent the overh of the crown the main stem of the tree is
heat by water from the soil therefor tree in the open begin
growth in the spring earlier than tree in the forest becaus the
soil in the open is warmer shrub begin their growth earlier than
tree becaus of the near of their crown to their root system
thi also explain why a warm rain will start veget quickli
too much heat will natur caus excess dry of the root or
excess evapor from the leav and therefor more water is
need by the tree in summer than in winter
5 influenc of season and frost the life process of a tree ar
check when the temperatur sink below a certain point the tree
is thu dure the winter in a period of rest and onli a few
chemic chang take place which lead up to the start of
veget in eastern unit state growth start in april and
ceas dure the latter part of august or in earli septemb the
differ part of a tree mai freez solid dure the winter without
injuri provid the tree is a nativ on exot tree mai suffer
greatli from extrem cold thi is on of the main reason why it is
alwai advis to plant nativ tree rather than those that ar
import and have not yet been acclimat frost dure
midwint ar not quit as injuri as earli and late frost and
therefor if on is go to protect plant from the winter cold
it is well to appli the cover earli enough and to keep it on
late enough to overcom thi difficulti
the mechan injuri from frost ar also import snow and
sleet will weigh down branch but rare break them while frost
will caus them to becom brittl and to break easili those who
climb and prune tree should be especi cautiou on frosti dai
6 influenc of air on the under side of leav and on other
surfac of a tree littl pore known as stomata mai be found in
the bark of birch and cherri tree these open ar veri
conspicu and ar there known as lenticel these pore ar
necessari for the breath of the tree respir wherebi
carbon acid ga is taken in from the air and oxygen given out the
process of assimil depend upon thi breath process and it
is therefor evid that when the stomata ar clog as mai occur
where a tree is subject to smoke or dust the life process of
the tree will be interf with the same injuri effect result
when the stomata of the root ar interf with such interfer
mai occur in case where a heavi layer of soil is pile around the
base of a tree where the soil about the base of a tree is allow
to becom compact where a tree is plant too deep or where the
root ar submerg under water for ani length of time in ani case
the air cannot get to the root and the tree suffer natur take
special cogniz of thi import requir in the case of
cypress tree which habitu grow under water here the tree ar
provid with special woodi protuber known as cypress knee
which emerg abov water and take the necessari air see fig 18
conclus from the forego it will be seen that tree have certain
need that natur or man must suppli these requir differ
with the differ speci and in all work of plant and care as
well as in the natur distribut of tree it is both interest
and necessari to observ these individu want to select speci
in accord with local condit and to care for tree in
conform with their natur need

through dry for lawn plant the branch should reach low to
the ground while for street purpos the branch should start at
about seven feet from the ground for street plant it is also
import that the stem should be perfectli straight and about two
inch in diamet for woodland plant the form of the tree is
of minor consider though it is well to have the leader well
defin here as well as in the other case see fig 95
when and how to procur the tree the tree should be select in the
nurseri person some person prefer to seal the more valuabl
specimen with leaden seal fall is the best time to make the
select becaus at that time on can have a wider choic of
materi select thu earli will also prevent delai in deliveri
at the time when it is desir to plant
when to plant the best time to plant tree is earli spring just befor
growth begin and after the frost is out of the ground from the
latter part of march to the earli part of mai is gener the
plant period in the eastern state
where on ha to plant both conifer and decidu tree it is
best to get the decidu in first and then the conif
how to plant the locat of the tree with relat to each other
should be carefulli consid on the lawn thei should be
separ far enough to allow for the full spread of the tree on
street tree should be plant thirti to thirtyf feet apart
and in case of the elm forti to fifti feet in woodland it is
well to plant as close as six feet apart where small seedl ar
us and about twelv feet apart in the case of tree an inch or
more in diamet an abund of good soil on to two cubic yard
is essenti with each tree where the specimen us ar an inch or
two in diamet a rich mellow loam such as on find on the
surfac of a welltil farm is the ideal soil manur should
never be place in direct contact with the root or stem of the
tree
protect of the root from dry is the chief precaut to be
observ dure the plant process and for thi reason a cloudi
dai is prefer to a sunni dai for plant in case of
evergreen the least exposur of the root is liabl to result
disastr even more so than in case of decidu tree thi is
why evergreen ar lift from the nurseri with a ball of soil
around the root all bruis root should be cut off befor the
tree is plant and the crown of the tree of the decidu speci
should be slightli trim in order to equal the loss of root by
a correspond decreas in leaf surfac
the tree should be set into the tree hole at the same depth that it
stood in the nurseri it root where there is no ball of soil
around them should be carefulli spread out and good soil should be
work in carefulli with the finger among the fine rootlet everi
root fibr is thu brought into close contact with the soil more
good soil should be ad in layer and firmli pack about the
root the last layer should remain loos so that it mai act as a
mulch or as an absorb of moistur the tree should then be
thoroughli water
illustr fig 95specif for a street tree
after care dure the first season the tree should be water and the
soil around it base slightli loosen at least onc a week
especi on hot summer dai where tree ar plant on street

chapter vi
the care of tree
studi i insect injuri to tree and how to combat them
in a gener wai tree ar attack by three class of insect and
the remedi to be emploi in each case depend upon the class to which
the insect belong the three class of insect ar
1 those that chew and swallow some portion of the leaf as for
exampl the elm leaf beetl and the tussock gipsi and browntail
moth
2 those that suck the plant juic from the leaf or bark such as the
san jo scale oystershel and scurfi scale the cottoni mapl
scale the mapl phenacoccu on the sugar mapl and the variou
aphid on beech norwai mapl etc
3 those that bore insid of the wood or inner bark the princip
member of thi class ar the leopard moth the hickorybark borer the
sugarmapl borer the elm borer and the bronzebirch borer
the chew insect ar destroi by sprai the leav with arsen
of lead or pari green the insect feed upon the poison foliag and
thu ar themselv poison
the suck insect ar kill by a contact poison that is by sprai
or wash the affect part of the tree with a solut which act
extern on the bodi of the insect smother or stifl them
the standard solut for thi purpos ar kerosen emuls soap and
water tobacco extract or limesulfur wash
illustr fig 97a gaspow sprai apparatu
the bore insect ar elimin by cut out the insect with a
knife by inject carbon bisulphid into the burrow and clog the
orific immedi after inject with putti or soap or in some case
where the tree is hopelessli infest by cut down and burn the
entir tree
illustr fig 98a barrel handpump sprai outfit
for inform regard the on of these three class to which ani
particular insect belong and for specif instruct on the
applic of a remedi the reader is advis to write to hi state
entomologist or to the us bureau of entomolog at washington dc the
letter should state the name of the tree affect togeth with the
charact of the injuri and should be accompani by a specimen of the
insect or by a piec of the affect leaf or bark prefer by both
the advic receiv will be authent and will be given without charg
illustr fig 99eggmass of the tussock moth
when to sprai in the case of chew insect the latter part of mai
is the time to sprai the caterpillar hatch from their egg and
the elm leaf beetl leav it winter quarter at that time in the
case of suck insect the instruct will have to be more
specif depend upon the particular insect in question some
suck insect can best be handl in mai or earli june when their
young emerg other can be effect treat in the fall or
winter when the tree ar dormant
how to sprai thorough is the essenti principl in all sprai
in the case of leafeat insect thi mean cover everi leaf
with the poison and appli it to the under side of the leav
where the insect gener feed in the case of suck insect
thorough mean an effort to touch everi insect with the sprai
it should be born in mind that the insect can be kill onli when
hit with the chemic the solut should be well stir and
should be appli by mean of a nozzl that will coat everi leaf
with a fine mistlik sprai mere drench or too prolong an
applic will caus the solut to run off special precaut
should be taken with contact poison to see that the formula is
correct too strong a solut will burn the foliag and tender
bark
sprai apparatu there ar variou form of sprai apparatu in the
market includ small knapsack pump barrel handpump and
gasolen and gaspow sprayer fig 97 and 98 hose and nozzl
ar essenti accessori onehalf inch threepli hose of the best
qualiti is necessari to stand the heavi pressur and wear two
50foot length is the usual quantiti requir for us with a barrel
handpump each line of hose should be suppli with a bamboo pole
10 feet long have a brass tube pass through it to carri the
nozzl the vermorel nozzl is the best type to us the cost of a
barrel outfit includ two line of hose nozzl and truck
should be from 30 to 40 power sprayer cost from 150 to 300 or
more
sprai materi
arsen of lead should be us in the proport of 4 pound of the
chemic to 50 gallon of water a brand of arsen of lead
contain at least 14 per cent of arsen oxid with not more than
50 per cent of water should be insist upon thi sprai mai be us
successfulli against caterpillar and other leafeat insect in
the spring or summer
whaleoil soap should be us at the rate of 1 pound of the soap
to 1 gallon of hot water if appli to the tree in winter as a
sprai in summer us 1 pound of the soap to 5 gallon of water thi
treatment is us for most suck insect
limesulfur wash is an excel materi to us against suck
insect such as the san jo scale and other armor scale the
applic of a limesulfur wash when put on dure the dormant
season is not like to harm a tree and ha such an excel
cleans effect that the benefit to be deriv in thi direct
alon ar often suffici to meet the cost of the treatment
limesulfur wash consist of a mixtur boil on hour of 40
pound of lime and 80 pound of sulfur in 50 gallon of water it
mai be had in prepar form and should then be us at the rate of 1
gallon to about 9 gallon of water in winter or earli spring befor
the bud open at other time of the year and for the softerbodi
insect a more dilut mixtur possibl 1 part to 30 or 40 part of
water should be us vari with each case separ
kerosen emuls consist of onehalf pound of hard soap 1 gallon
of boil water and 2 gallon of kerosen it mai be obtain in
prepar form and is then to be us at the rate of on part of the
solut to nine part of water when appli in winter or to the
bark onli in summer us 2 gallon of the solut to a 40gallon
barrel of water when appli it to the leav in the summer
kerosen emuls is us as a treatment for scale insect
tobacco water should be prepar by steep onehalf pound of
tobacco stem or leav in a gallon of boil water and later
dilut the product with 5 to 10 gallon of water it is
particularli us for plant lice in the summer
the life histori of an insect in a gener wai all insect have four
stage of transform befor a new gener is produc it is
import to consid the natur of these four stage in order that
the habit of ani particular insect and the remedi applic in
combat it mai be understood
all insect develop from egg fig 99 the egg then hatch into
caterpillar or grub which is the larva stage in which most
insect do the greatest damag to tree the caterpillar or grub
grow and develop rapidli and henc their feed is most raven
follow the larva stage come the third or pupa stage which is
the dormant stage of the insect in thi stage the insect curl
itself up under the protect of a silken cocoon like the tussock
moth or of a curl leaf like the browntail moth or it mai be
entir unshelt like the pupa of the elm leaf beetl after the
pupa stage come the adult insect which mai be a moth or a
beetl
a studi of the four stage of ani particular insect is known as a
studi of it life histori the import fact to know about the
life histori of an insect ar the stage in which it doe most of it
feed and the period of the year in which thi occur it is also
import to know how the insect spend the winter in order to
decid upon a winter treatment
import insect
the elm leaf beetl
life histori the elm leaf beetl fig 100 is annual caus the
defoli of thousand of elm tree throughout the unit state
sever success defoli ar liabl to kill a tree the
insect pass the winter in the beetl form hide themselv in
attic and wherev els thei can secur shelter in the middl of
mai when the bud of the elm tree unfold the beetl emerg from
their winter quarter mate and commenc eat the leav thu
produc littl hole through them while thi feed is go on
the femal deposit littl bright yellow egg on the under side of
the leav which soon hatch into small larva or grub the grub
then eat awai the soft portion of the leaf caus it to look like
lacework the grub becom full grown in twenti dai crawl down to
the base of the tree and there transform into nake orangecolor
pupa thi occur in the earli part of august after remain in
the pupa stage about a week thei chang into beetl again which
either begin feed or go to winter quarter
remedi there ar three wai of combat thi insect first by
sprai the foliag with arsen of lead in the latter part of
mai while the beetl ar feed and repeat the sprai in
june when the larva emerg the sprai method is the on most to
be reli on in fight thi insect a second though less
import remedi consist in destroi the pupa when thei
gather in larg quantiti at the base of the tree thi mai be
accomplish by gather them bodili and destroi them or by
pour hot water or a solut of kerosen over them in larg
tree it mai be necessari to climb to the crotch of the main limb
to get some of them the third remedi li in gather and
destroi the adult beetl when found in their winter quarter
the applic of band of burlap or tanglefoot or of other
substanc often seen on the trunk of elm tree is useless sinc
these band onli prevent the larva from crawl down from the
leav to the base and serv to prevent noth from crawl up
scrape the trunk of elm tree is also a wast of effort

studi ii tree diseas
becaus tree have want analog to those of human be thei also
have diseas similar to those which afflict human be in mani case
these diseas act like cancer growth upon the human bodi in some
instanc the ailment mai be a gener fail due to improp feed
and in other case it mai be due to interfer with the life process
of the tree
how to tell an ail tree whatev the caus an ail tree will
manifest it ailment by on or more symptom
a chang of color in the leav at a time when thei should be
perfectli green indic that the tree is not grow under normal
condit possibl becaus of an insuffici of moistur or
light or an overdos of foreign gase or salt wither of the
leav is anoth sign of irregular in water suppli dead top
point to some difficulti in the soil condit or to some diseas
of the root or branch spot leav and mushroomlik growth
or bracket protrud from the bark as in fig 108 ar sure sign
of diseas
in attempt to find out whether a tree is healthi or not on
would therefor do well to consid whether the condit under
which it is grow ar normal or not whether the tree is suitabl
for the locat whether the soil is too dry or too wet whether
the root ar depriv of their necessari water and air by an
impenetr cover of concret or soil whether the soil is well
drain and free from foreign gase and salt whether the tree is
receiv plenti of light or is too much expos and whether it is
free from insect and fungi
if after a thorough examin it is found that the ailment ha
gone too far it mai not be wise to try to save the tree a time
remov of a tree badli infest with insect or fungi mai often be
the best procedur and mai save mani neighbor tree from
contagi infect for thi howev no rule can be laid down
and much will depend on the local condit and the judgment and
knowledg of the person concern

diseas but now the diseas ha advanc over the whole chestnut
area in the unit state reach as far south as virginia and as
far west as buffalo fig 111 show the result of the chestnut
diseas
the fungu attack the cambium tissu underneath the bark it enter
through a wound in the bark and send it fungou thread from the
point of infect all around the trunk until the latter is girdl
and kill thi mai all happen within on season it is not until
the tree ha practic been destroi that the diseas make it
appear on the surfac of the bark in the form of brown patch
stud with littl pustul that carri the spore when onc
girdl the tree is kill abov the point of infect and
everyth abov di while some of the twig below mai live until
thei ar attack individu by the diseas or until the trunk

tree ar veri much like human be in their requir mode of
life and diseas and the gener principl applic to the care of
on ar equal import to the intellig treatment of the other the
remov of limb from tree as well as from human be must be done
sparingli and judici wound in both tree and human be must
be disinfect and dress to keep out all fungu or diseas germ
fungou growth of tree ar similar to human cancer both in the
manner of their develop and the surgic treatment which thei
requir improp prune will invit fungi and insect to the tree
henc the import of a knowledg of fundament principl in thi
branch of tree care
illustr fig 112a tree prune improperli and too sever
time too much prune at on time should never be practic fig 112
and no branch should be remov from a tree without good reason for
so do dead and broken branch should be remov as soon as
observ regardless of ani special prune season becaus thei ar
danger unsightli and carri insect and diseas into the heart of
the tree but all other prune whether it be for the purpos of
perfect the form in shade tree or for increas the product
of fruit in orchard tree should be confin to certain season
shade and ornament tree can best be prune in the fall while the
leav ar still on the tree and while the tree itself is in
practic a dormant state
proper cut all prune should be commenc at the top of the tree
and finish at the bottom a shorten branch except in poplar
and willow which should be cut in close should termin in
small twig which mai draw the sap to the freshli cut wound where a
branch is remov entir the cut should be madeclos and even
with the trunk as in fig 113 wherev there is a stub left after
cut off a branch the grow tissu of the tree cannot cover it
and the stub eventu decai fall out and leav a hole see
fig 114 which serv to carri diseas and insect to the heart of
the tree thi idea of close cut cannot be overemphas
where larg branch have to be remov the split and rip
of the bark along the trunk is prevent by make on cut beneath
the branch about a foot or two awai from the trunk and then
anoth abov close to the trunk
illustr fig 113branch properli cut close to the trunk
too sever prune in prune tree mani peopl have a tendenc to cut
them back so sever as to remov everyth but the bare trunk and
a few of the main branch thi process is known as head
back it is a method howev which should not be resort to
except in tree that ar veri old and fail and even there onli
with certain speci like the silver mapl sycamor linden and
elm tree like the sugar mapl will not stand thi treatment at
all the willow is a tree that will stand the process veri readili
and the carolina poplar must be cut back everi few year in order
to keep it crown from becom too tall scraggi and unsaf

cover wound the import of immedi cover all wound with
coal tar cannot be overst if the wound is not tar the

coal tar is by far prefer to paint and other substanc for
cover the wound the tar penetr the expos wood produc
an antisept as well as a protect effect paint onli form a
cover which mai peel off in cours of time and which will later
protrud from the cut thu form between the paint and the wood
a suitabl breed place for the develop of destruct fungi

where tree have been properli care for from their earli start wound
and caviti and their subsequ elabor treatment have no place but
where tree have been neglect or improperli care for wound and
caviti ar bound to occur and earli treatment becom a necess
there ar two kind of wound on tree 1 surfac wound which do not
extend beyond the inner bark and 2 deep wound or caviti which mai
rang from a small hole in a crotch to the hollow of an entir trunk
surfac wound surfac wound fig 116 ar due to bruis bark and a
tree thu injur can no longer produc the proper amount of foliag
or remain healthi veri long the reason for thi becom veri
appar when on look into the natur of the live or activ
tissu of a tree and note how thi tissu becom affect by such
injuri
illustr fig 116a surfac wound properli freed from decai
wood and cover with coal tar
thi live or activ tissu is known as the cambium layer and is
a thin tissu situat immedi under the bark it must
complet envelop the stem root and branch of the tree the
outer bark is a protect cover to thi live layer while the
entir interior wood tissu chiefli serv as a skeleton or support
for the tree the cambium layer is the real activ part of the
tree it is the part which transmit the sap from the base of the
tree to it crown it is the part which caus the tree to grow by
the format of new cell pile up in the form of ring around the
heart of the tree and it is also the part which prevent the
entranc of insect and diseas to the inner wood from thi it is
quit evid that ani injuri to the bark and consequ to thi
cambium layer alongsid of it will not onli cut off a portion of
the sap suppli and hinder the growth of the tree to an extent
proport to the size of the wound but will also expos the
inner wood to the action of decai the wound mai at first appear
insignific but if neglect it will soon commenc to decai
and thu to carri diseas and insect into the tree the tree then
becom hollow and danger and it life is doom
injuri to the cambium layer result in surfac wound mai be due
to the improp cut of a branch to the bite of a hors to the
cut of a knife or the careless wield of an ax to the bore of
an insect or to the decai of a fungou diseas see fig 117
whatev the caus the remedi li in clean out all decai
wood remov the loos bark and cover the expos wood with
coal tar
in cut off the loos bark the edg should be made smooth
befor the coal tar is appli loos bark put back against a tree
will never grow and will onli tend to harbor insect and diseas
bandag too ar hurt becaus underneath the bandag diseas
will develop more rapidli than where the wound is expos to the sun
and wind the applic of tin or manur to wound is often
indulg in and is equal injuri to the tree the secret of all
wound treatment is to keep the wound smooth clean to the live
tissu and well cover with coal tar
the chisel or goug is the best tool to emploi in thi work a sharp
hawkbil knife will be us in cut off the loos bark coal
tar is the best materi for cover wound becaus it ha both an
antisept and a protect effect on the wood tissu paint which
is veri often us as a substitut for coal tar is not as
effect becaus the paint is apt to peel in time thu allow
moistur and diseas to enter the crevic between the paint and the
wood
illustr fig 117a neglect surfac wound note the rough
surfac of the wound the want of a coal tar cover and the fungou
growth that follow
caviti deep wound and caviti ar gener the result of stub
that have been permit to rot and fall out surfac wound allow
to decai will deepen in cours of time and produc caviti
caviti in tree ar especi suscept to the attack of
diseas becaus in a caviti there is bound to exist an
accumul of moistur with thi there is also consider
dark and protect from wind and cold and these ar all ideal
condit for the develop of diseas
the success applic of a remedi in all caviti treatment
hing on thi princip conditionthat all trace of diseas
shall be entir elimin befor treatment is commenc
fungou diseas attack a caviti produc a mass of fiber known
as the mycelium that penetr the bodi of the tree or limb on
which the caviti is locat in elimin diseas from a caviti
it is therefor essenti to go beyond the mere decai surfac
and to cut out all fungou fiber that radiat into the interior of
the tree where these fiber have penetr so deepli that it
becom imposs to remov everi on of them the tree or limb
thu affect had better be cut down fig 118 the presenc of
the mycelium in wood tissu can readili be told by the discolor
and disintegr appear of the wood
the fill in a caviti moreov should serv to prevent the
accumul of water and where a caviti is perpendicular and so
locat that the water can be drain off without the fill the
latter should be avoid and the caviti should mere be clean out
and tar fig 116 where the diseas can be entir
elimin where the caviti is not too larg and where a fill
will serv the practic purpos of prevent the accumul of
moistur the work of fill should be resort to
illustr fig 118a caviti fill in a tree that should have
been cut down note how the entir interior is decai and how the tree
fell apart soon after treatment
fill should be done in the follow manner first the interior
should be thoroughli freed from diseas wood and insect the
chisel goug mall and knife ar the tool and it is better to
cut deep and remov everi trace of decai wood than it is to leav
a smaller hole in an unhealthi state the inner surfac of the
caviti should then be cover with a coat of white lead paint which
act as a disinfect and help to hold the fill corros
sublim or bordeaux mixtur mai be us as a substitut for the
white lead paint a coat of coal tar over the paint is the next
step the caviti is then solidli pack with brick stone and
mortar as in fig 119 and finish with a layer of cement at the
mouth of the orific thi surfac layer of cement should not be
brought out to the same plane with the outer bark of the tree but
should rather reced a littl beyond the grow tissu cambium
layer which is situat immedi below the bark fig 120 in
thi wai the grow tissu will be enabl to roll over the cement
and to cover the whole caviti if it be a small on or els to grow
out suffici to overlap the fill and hold it as a frame hold
a pictur the cement is us in mixtur with sand in the proport
of onethird of cement to twothird of sand when dry the outer
layer of cement should be cover with coal tar to prevent crack

tree that tend to split certain speci of tree like the linden and
elm often tend to split gener in the crotch of sever limb
and sometim in a fissur along the trunk of the tree midwint is
the period when thi usual occur and time action will save the
tree the remedi li in fasten togeth the variou part of the
tree by mean of bolt or chain
a veri injuri method of accomplish thi end is frequent
resort to where each of the branch is bound by an iron band and
the band ar then join by a bar the branch eventu outgrow
the diamet of the band caus the latter to cut through the
bark of the limb and to destroi them
anoth method of brace limb togeth consist in run a
singl bolt through them and fasten each end of the bolt with a
washer and nut thi method is prefer to the first becaus it
allow for the growth of the limb in thick
illustr fig 121diagram show the triplebar method of
fasten limb
a still better method howev consist in us a bar compos of
three part as shown in fig 121 each of the two branch ha a
short bolt pass through it horizont and the two short bolt
ar then connect by a third bar thi arrang will shift all
the pressur caus by the swai of the limb to the middl
connectingbar in case of a windstorm the middl bar will be the
on to bend while the bolt which pass through the limb will
remain intact the outer end of the short bolt should have their
washer and nut slightli embed in the wood of the tree so that
the live tissu of the tree mai eventu grow over them in such
a wai as to hold the bar firmli in place and to exclud moistur
and diseas the washer and nut on the inner side of the limb
should also be embed
a chain is sometim advantag substitut for the middl
section of the bar and in some case where more than two branch
have to be join togeth a ring might take the place of the
middl bar or chain
bolt on a tree detract consider from it natur beauti and
should therefor be us onli where thei ar absolut necessari
for the safeti of the tree thei should be place as high up in the
tree as possibl without weaken the limb

forestri
studi i what forestri is and what it doe
although forestri is not a new idea but as a scienc and an art ha
been appli for nearli two thousand year there ar mani person who
still need an explan of it aim and principl
forestri deal with the establish protect and util of
forest
by establish is meant the plant of new forest and the cut
of matur forest in such a wai as to encourag a natur growth of new
tree without artifici plant or seed the plant mai consist
of sow seed or of set out young tree the establish of a
forest by cut mai consist of the remov of all matur tree and
depend upon the remain stump to reproduc the forest from
sprout or it mai consist of the remov of onli a portion of the
matur tree thu give the young seedl on the ground room in
which to grow
by protect is meant the safeguard of the forest from fire wind
insect diseas and injuri for which man is directli respons here
the forest also prevent injuri to the tree from the graze and
brows of sheep and goat and keep hi forest so well stock that
no wind can uproot the tree nor can the sun dry up the moist forest
soil
illustr fig 122a forest of bull pine cut on forestri

by util is meant the conserv and intellig harvest of
the forest with the aim of obtain the greatest amount of product
from a given area with the least wast in the quickest time and
without the slightest deterior of the forest as a whole the
forest cut hi matur tree onli and gener leav a suffici

but in thi strife there is also mutual aid each tree help to
protect it neighbor against the danger of be uproot by the
wind and against the sun which is liabl to dry up the rich soil
around the root thi soil is differ from the soil on the open
lawn it consist of an accumul of decai leav mix with
inorgan matter form togeth a rich composit known as
humu the tree also aid each other in form a close canopi
that prevent the rapid evapor of water from the ground
the intens of these condit will vari a great deal with the
composit of the forest and the natur and habit of the
individu tree by composit or type of forest is meant the
proport in which the variou speci of tree ar group ie
whether a certain section of woodland is compos of on speci or
of a mixtur of speci by habit is meant the requir of the

first by sow the seed directli on the land
second by first rais young tree in nurseri and later set
them out in their perman locat in the forest thi method is
applic where quick result ar desir where the area is not
too larg or in treeless region and larg open gap where there
is littl chanc for new tree to spring up from seed furnish by

engag in thi work the fundament principl of start and
maintain a nurseri have alreadi been refer to in the chapter
on what tree to plant and how
the third method of establish a forest from seed is by cut
the tree in the exist forest so that the seed fall from the
remain tree will with the addit of light and space readili
take root and fill in the gap with a vigor growth of tree
without artifici seed or plant thi give rise to sever
method of cut or harvest forest for the purpos of
encourag natur reproduct the cut mai extend to singl
tree over the whole area or over onli a part of the whole area
where the cut is confin to singl tree the system is known
as the select system becaus the tree ar select
individu with a view to retain the best and most vigor
stock and remov the overcrowd specimen and those that ar
fulli matur or infest with diseas or insect
fig 130 is a diagrammat illustr of the oper of thi
system in anoth system the cut is done in group or in
strip and the number of area of the group or strip is extend
from time to time until the whole forest is clear thi system is
illustr in fig 131 still anoth method consist in
encourag tree which will thrive in the shade such as the beech
spruce and hemlock to grow under lightdemand tree like the

the usual idea that it cost a great deal to plant sever thousand
young tree is erron an ordinari woodlot mai be stock with a
wellselect number of young tree at a cost less than the price
gener paid for a dozen good specimen tree for the front lawn
it is not necessari to underpl the woodlot with big tree the
exist big tree ar there to give charact to the forest and the
new plant should be done princip as a futur invest and
as a mean of perpetu the life of the woodlot young tree ar
even more desir for such plant than the older and more
expens on the young tree will adapt themselv to the local
soil and climat condit more easili than the older on their
demand for food and moistur is more easili satisfi and becaus
of their small cost on can even afford to lose a larg percentag
of them after plant
the young plant should be twoyearold seedl or threeyearold
transplant
twoyearold seedl ar tree that have been grown from the seed
in seed bed until thei reach that ag thei run from two to fifteen
inch in height depend upon the speci
threeyearold transplant have been grown from the seed in seed
bed and at the end of the first or second year have been taken up
and transplant into row where thei grow a year or two longer
thei ar usual a littl taller than the twoyearold seedl
ar much stockier and have a better root system for thi reason
threeyearold transplant ar a littl more desir as stock for
plant thei will withstand drought better than seedl
the best result from woodland plant ar obtain with
nativegrown materi such stock is stronger hardier and better

million of littl tree ar grown for reforest purpos in
order to encourag privat tree plant the forestri commiss
ar usual will to sell some of these tree at cost price under
certain condit to privat land owner inquiri should be
made to the state forestri commiss
great care must be taken to select the speci most suitabl for the
particular soil climat and light condit of the woodlot the
tree which ar nativ to the local and ar found grow
thriftili on the woodlot ar the on that have proven their
adapt to the local condit and should therefor be the
princip speci us for underpl a list from which to
select the main stock would therefor vari with the local in
the eastern state it would compris the usual hardi tree like the
red pin and scarlet oak the beech the red and sugar mapl the
white ash the tulip tree sycamor sweet gum and locust among the
decidu tree the white austrian red pitch and scotch pine
the hemlock and the yew among the conif
with the main stock well select on mai add a number of tree and
shrub that will give to the woodland scene a pleas appear at
all season the brilliant autumn tint of the sassafra
pepperidg blue beech viburnum juneberri and sumach ar
strikingli attract the flower dogwood along the drive and
path will add a charm in june as well as in autumn and an
occasion group of white birch will have the same effect if plant
among group of evergreen addit undergrowth of nativ
woodland shrub such as new jersei tea redberri elder and
blueberri for the eastern state will augment the natur of
the scene and help to conserv the moistur in the soil
two or three year growth will rais these plant abov all grass
and low veget and a sprinkl of laurel rhododendron hardi
fern and a few intermingl coloni of nativ wild flower such
as bloodroot fals solomon seal and columbin for the east as
a ground cover will put the finish touch to the forest scene
as to method of plant the littl tree the follow
suggest mai prove of valu as soon as the plant ar receiv
thei should be taken from the box and dip in a thick puddl of
water and loam the root must be thoroughli cover with the mud
then the bundl into which the littl tree ar ti should be
loosen and the tree place in a trench dug on a slant the dirt
should be place over the root and the expos part of the plant
cover with brush or burlap to keep awai the rai of the sun
when readi for plant a few plant ar dug up set in a pail with
thin mud at the bottom and carri to the place of plant the
most econom method of plant is for on man to make the hole
with a mattock these hole ar made about a foot in diamet by
scrape off the sod with the mattock and then dig a littl hole
in the dirt underneath a second man follow with a pail of plant
and set a singl plant in thi hole with hi hand see fig 129
make sure that the root ar straight and spread out on the bottom
of the hole the dirt should then be pack firmli around the plant
and press down with the foot
improv by cut the remov of certain tree in a grove is often
necessari to improv the qualiti of the better tree increas their
growth make the place access and enhanc it beauti cut
in a wood area should be confin to suppress tree dead and
dy tree and tree badli infest with insect and diseas in
case of farm woodland matur tree of market valu mai be cut but
in park and on privat estat these have a greater valu when left
stand the cut should leav a clean stand of wellselect
specimen which will thrive under the favor influenc of more
light and grow space consider care is requir to prevent
injuri to the young tree when the older specimen ar cut and
haul out of the wood the mark of the tree to be remov can
best be done in summer when the dead and live tree can be
distinguish with eas and when the requisit grow space for
each tree can be judg better from the densiti of the crown the
cut howev can be done most advantag in winter
immedi after cut all diseas and infest wood should be
destroi the sound wood mai be util for variou purpos the
bigger log mai be sold to the local lumber dealer and the smaller
materi mai be us for firewood the remain brush should be
withdrawn from the woodlot to prevent fire dure the dry summer
month
in mark tree for remov a number of consider ar to be
born in mind besid the elimin of dead diseas and
suppress tree when the marker is work among crowd tree of
equal height he should save those that ar most like to grow into
fine specimen tree and cut out all those that interfer with them
the select must also favor tree which ar best adapt to the
local soil and climat condit and those which will add to the
beauti of the place in thi respect the method of mark will be
differ from that us in commerci forestri where the aim is to
net the greatest profit from the timber in pure forestri practic
on see no valu in such speci as dogwood ironwood juneberri
sumac and sassafra and will therefor never allow those to grow up
in abund and crowd out other tree of a higher market valu but
on privat estat and in park woodland where beauti is an
import consider such speci add wonder color and
attract to the forest scene especi along the road and
path and should be favor as much as the other hardier tree on
must not mark too sever in on spot or the soil will be dri out
from exposur to sun and wind when the gap between the tree ar
too larg the tree will grow more slowli and the trunk will
becom cover with numer shoot or sucker which depriv the
crown of their necessari food and caus them to die back where
the tree ar tall and slim or on short and steep hillsid it is
also import to be conserv in mark in order that the stand
mai not be expos to the danger of windfal no hardandfast rule
can be laid down as to what would constitut a conserv
percentag of tree to cut down thi depend entir on the local
condit and on the exposur of the woodlot but in gener it is
not well to remov more than twenti per cent of the stand nor to
repeat the cut on the same spot often than onc in five or six
year the first cut will of cours be the heaviest and all
subsequ cut will becom lighter and lighter until the
woodlot is put in good grow condit on privat estat and
park where beauti is the chief aim the woodland should be kept as
natur inform and as thick as possibl where the woodland is
cut up by mani path and drive densiti of veget will add to
the impress of depth and distanc
protect thi subject ha alreadi been discuss consider in the

guard woodland from fire is the most import form of
protect surfac fire ar veri common on small woodland hold
and the damag done to the stand veget is gener
underestim an ordinari ground or surfac fire on a woodland

shown in fig 143 often help to prevent fire it is also help to
institut strict rule against drop light match or tobacco
or burn brush when the ground is veri dry or leav smoulder
wood without wait to see that the fire is complet out there
should be mani road and footpath wind through the woodland in
order that thei mai serv as check or fire lane in time of fire
these road and path should be kept free from brush and leav and
should be frequent patrol when made not too wide
unpretenti and in conform with the natur surround such

wind through the woodland expos it charm and afford
opportun for pleasant drive and walk the border of the
path can be given special attent by place the more beauti
nativ shrub in promin posit where thei can lend increas
attract
in case of fire it should be possibl to call for aid by telephon
directli from the woodland and to find within easi reach the tool
necessari to combat fire it is also import to obtain the
cooper of on neighbor in protect the adjoin
woodland becaus the danger from insect diseas and fire
threaten on bit of woodland area ar more or less depend upon

how to judg the qualiti of wood to know the name of a piec of wood
mean in a gener wai to know certain qualiti that ar common
to all other piec of wood of that speci but it doe not explain
the special peculiar of the piec in question or why that
particular piec is more suitabl or unsuit for a particular
purpos than anoth piec of the same speci the mere
identif of the wood doe not explain why a particular piec
is tougher stronger or of darker color than anoth piec of the
same speci or even of the same tree the reason for these special
differ li in the fact that wood is not a homogen materi
like metal within the same tree differ part vari in qualiti
the heartwood is gener heavier and of deeper color than the
sapwood the butt is superior to the top wood and the manner in
which the wood wa saw and dri will affect it qualiti knot
split check and discolor due to incipi decai ar defect
worth consid wood that look lusterless is usual defect
becaus the lack of luster is gener due to diseas wood that
ar hard wear best hard can be determin readili by strike
the wood with a hammer and note the sound produc a clear
ring sound is a sign of hard the strength of a piec of wood
can be judg by it weight after it is well dri heavi wood ar
usual strong a larg amount of late wood is an indic of
strength and the product of a clear sound when struck with a
hammer is also an evid of strength
chapter ix
an outdoor lesson on tree
the import of natur studi in the train of the child is now well
recogn the influenc of such studi from the hygien moral and
aesthet point of view ar far reach and cannot be express in
dollar and cent in hi associ with natur the child is led to
observ more close and to know and to be fond of what is truli
beauti in lifebeauti surround beauti thought and
beauti deed he is inspir with rever for law order and truth
becaus he see it constantli reflect in all work of natur the
social instinct is highli develop and even the parent ar often
better through the agenc of their children
the onli wai howev to studi natureespeci plantsi to studi
it out of door our present tendenc to gather in citi demand the
upbuild influenc of trip into the open in order to equip the child
mental and physic to face the world and it work with the strength
and tenac characterist of the countrybr moreov the studi of
object rather than book is an axiom in modern educ and here too
we can readili see that the best wai to studi tree is to take the pupil
to the tree such studi ar more last than book studi becaus thei
emphas the spirit and the goal rather than the petti fact
educ and parent ar now recogn the valu of outdoor trip
for their children and ar begin to indulg in them quit
frequent in mani instanc teacher about to take out their children
for a dai have inquir of the writer how to go about give a gener
field lesson when thei reach the park or woodland the purpos of thi
chapter is to answer such a question and yet it is evid that it
cannot be answer complet what to observ out door and how to
present on impress is a broad question and vari with the
knowledg and abil of the teacher as well as with the ag and
experi of the children the how and the what in natur studi is of
greater import than the hard dry fact and that must be left entir
to the teacher a few suggest howev mai not be amiss
1 gener observ with a view to charact build first of all
it is import to rememb that the great valu of all tree and
natur studi is the inculc in the mind of the children of an
appreci and love for the beauti inspir them to love
tree gener mean more than teach them to know tree mere
fact about tree taught in an academ wai ar often no more
last than the formula in trigonometri which most of us have long
ago forgotten the import thing is that perman result be left
and noth els will produc such last impress as the studi
of tree out of door
illustr fig 153tree have individu
gener observ about tree can be made by point out the
beauti and charact of the individu form and branch their
harmoni in their relat to each other as factor of a beauti
composit and the wealth of shade and color in their leav
bark and flower compar for instanc the intric ramif
of an american elm with the simpl branch of a sugar mapl the
sturdi of a white oak with the tender of a soft mapl the
wide spread of a beech with the slender form of a lombardi poplar
the upward point branch of a gingko with the droop form of a
weep willow at close rang each of these tree reveal itself
as an individu with a charact quit it own at littl distanc
you mai see them group togeth subordin their individu
and help to blend into a beauti composit with a charact
all it own there is noth more inspir than the varieti of
green in the spring foliag the divers of color in the spring
blossom and the wonder displai of autumn tint offer by the
sweet gum sassafra dogwood black gum red mapl sugar mapl
scarlet oak blue beech sorrel tree ash and gingko the white bark
of the grai birch the dark bark of the black oak the grai of the
beech the golden yellow of the mulberri and the mottl bark of the
sycamor ar interest comparison the smooth bark of the
mockernut hickori contrast greatli with the shaggi bark of the
shagbark hickorymemb of the same famili and yet how differ
a wonder opportun is thu offer for a compar studi of
human natureindividu and commun life all reflect in
tree
with thi preliminari studi and with the addit of some remark on
the valu of tree as health giver and moral uplift the child
is interest and attract the lesson so far ha attain it aim
2 specif observ with a view to train the observ power
the child train in close of observ and scientif
precis mai be the next consider hi enthusiasm will now
prompt him to lend hi interest for greater detail we can teach him
to recogn a few of the common tree by their gener
charactersan american elm by it fanshap form a grai birch by
it white bark a white pine by the five needl to each cluster a
horsechestnut by it opposit branch and big sticki bud and a
willow by it droop habit after that we mai introduc if the
ag of the pupil justifi more detail extend to greater
differ which distinguish on speci from anoth
the lesson might continu by point out the requir of tree
for water and light find a tree on some slope where the root ar
expos and anoth which is be encroach upon by it neighbor
and show how in on case the root travel in search of water and
food and in the other the branch bend toward the light grow
more vigor on that side compar the tree on the open lawn
with those in the grove and show how those in the open have grown
with branch near the ground while those in the woodland ar
slender tall and free from branch to some distanc abov the
ground point out the lenticel on the bark of birch and sweet
cherri tree and explain how tree breath compar thi process
with that of the human bodi you mai now come across an old stump
and here you can point out the structur of the woodth sapwood
cambium and bark you can illustr the annual ring and count the
ag of the tree at anoth point you mai find a tree with a wound
or bruis bark and here you can readili make a closer studi of the
cambium layer and it manner of growth
the adapt of plant to the season chang open anoth
interest field of studi for beginn if the season is the fall
or winter note how the tree have prepar themselv for the
winter cold by termin the flow of sap by drop their
leav too tender to resist the winter cold and by cover their
bud with scale line with down on the insid observ how the
insect have spun for themselv silken nest or remain preserv in
the egg state over the winter if the season is spring or summer the
opposit mai be note see how everyth turn to life how the
bud ar open the leav emerg the sap run seed
germin and flower bloom
the soil condit on the lawn and in the grove furnish anoth
interest featur of comparison and studi in the grove you can
demonstr the decomposit of the fallen leav the format of
humu and it valu to the tree the import of the forest soil
as a conserv of water and it relat to stream flow and soil
eros can be brought out at thi junctur an erod bank and a
slope cover with tree and shrub would provid excel model
for thi studi a consider of the econom valu of the tree
would also be in place
3 civic lesson reflect in tree the commun life of tree in the
grove their growth struggl for light and food and their mutual
aid can be brought out and compar with the commun life among
peopl the tree mai here be seen struggl with each other for
light and food forc each other growth upward some win out
and develop into stalwart and thrifti specimen and other
becom suppress or entir kill on the other hand thei mai
be seen help each other in their commun growth by protect
each other from windfal and by contribut to the fertil of the
forest soil in drop their leav and shade the ground so that
these fallen leav mai decompos readili
illustr fig 154tree also grow in commun
4 enemi of tree an old stump or tree mai be seen crumbl awai
under the influenc of fungi and here the children mai be shown the
effect of tree diseas both as destroy of life and as
upbuild becaus fungi turn to dust the live tree and build
up other by furnish them with the decompos wood matter
insect too mai be invad the old dead tree and someth of
their natur habit and influenc mai be gone into thei mai be
shown as wood borer leaf eater or sap sucker all injuri to
the tree on the other hand thei mai be shown as seed dissemin
and as parasit on other injuri insect all benefactor
forest fire as an enemi of tree might be touch upon by note
how easili the leav mai be ignit and a surfac fire start when
the season is dry top and ground fire eman from surfac fire
can then be readili explain
illustr fig 155tree blend togeth to form a beauti
composit
5 express the pupil have by thi time been taught to feel the
beauti to observ carefulli and to reason intellig and thei
mai now be train to express themselv properli thi mai be
accomplish by ask them to rememb their observ and to
write about them in the classroom the lesson mai be supplement
with effect read about tree and forest interest read
matter of thi sort can be found in abund in children reader
in special book on the subject and in arbor dai manual publish
by the variou state educ depart
6 prepar in order to save time look for object of interest
and for the purpos of correl the variou observ so that
all will follow in orderli sequenc it is well for the teacher or
leader to go over the ground beforehand and note the special
featur of interest the variou topic can then be given some
thought and a brief synopsi can be drawn up to serv as a
memorandum and guid on the trip
it is also well to be provid with a hatchet to cut into some
decai stump a trowel to dig up the forest soil a knife for
cut off twig and a hand read glass for examin the
structur part of the variou object under observ a camera
is alwai a valuabl asset becaus the photograph hung in the
classroom becom record of great interest to all particip
7 suggest for form tree club a good wai to interest children
in tree and natur studi is to form among them a tree club the
idea ha been fulli develop in brooklyn ny newark nj and
other citi and consist of form club of children in the public
school and privat institut for the purpos of interest them
in the tree around their school and their home the member of
these club ar each given the tree warden badg of author and
assign to some special duti in the preserv of the local
tree a plan of studi and of outdoor trip is laid out for them by
their director and at state period thei ar given illustr
lectur on tree and taken to the neighbor park or woodland
