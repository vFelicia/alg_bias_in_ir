the present book is intend as far as possibl to give an exact
insight into the theori of rel to those reader who from a
gener scientif and philosoph point of view ar interest in
the theori but who ar not convers with the mathemat apparatu
of theoret physic the work presum a standard of educ
correspond to that of a univers matricul examin and
despit the short of the book a fair amount of patienc and forc
of will on the part of the reader the author ha spare himself no
pain in hi endeavour to present the main idea in the simplest and
most intellig form and on the whole in the sequenc and
connect in which thei actual origin in the interest of
clear it appear to me inevit that i should repeat myself
frequent without pai the slightest attent to the eleg of
the present i adher scrupul to the precept of that
brilliant theoret physicist l boltzmann accord to whom matter
of eleg ought to be left to the tailor and to the cobbler i make
no pretenc of have withheld from the reader difficulti which ar
inher to the subject on the other hand i have purpos treat
the empir physic foundat of the theori in a stepmotherli
fashion so that reader unfamiliar with physic mai not feel like the
wander who wa unabl to see the forest for the tree mai the book
bring some on a few happi hour of suggest thought

physic mean of geometr proposit
in your schooldai most of you who read thi book made acquaint
with the nobl build of euclid geometri and you rememberperhap
with more respect than loveth magnific structur on the lofti
staircas of which you were chase about for uncount hour by
conscienti teacher by reason of our past experi you would
certainli regard everyon with disdain who should pronounc even the
most outofthewai proposit of thi scienc to be untru but
perhap thi feel of proud certainti would leav you immedi if
some on were to ask you what then do you mean by the assert
that these proposit ar true let us proce to give thi question
a littl consider
geometri set out from certain concept such as plane point
and straight line with which we ar abl to associ more or less
definit idea and from certain simpl proposit axiom which in
virtu of these idea we ar inclin to accept as true then on
the basi of a logic process the justif of which we feel
ourselv compel to admit all remain proposit ar shown to
follow from those axiom ie thei ar proven a proposit is then
correct true when it ha been deriv in the recognis manner from
the axiom the question of truth of the individu geometr
proposit is thu reduc to on of the truth of the axiom now
it ha long been known that the last question is not onli unanswer
by the method of geometri but that it is in itself entir without
mean we cannot ask whether it is true that onli on straight line
goe through two point we can onli sai that euclidean geometri deal
with thing call straight line to each of which is ascrib the
properti of be uniqu determin by two point situat on it the
concept true doe not talli with the assert of pure geometri
becaus by the word true we ar eventu in the habit of
design alwai the correspond with a real object geometri
howev is not concern with the relat of the idea involv in it
to object of experi but onli with the logic connect of these
idea among themselv
it is not difficult to understand why in spite of thi we feel
constrain to call the proposit of geometri true geometr
idea correspond to more or less exact object in natur and these
last ar undoubtedli the exclus caus of the genesi of those idea
geometri ought to refrain from such a cours in order to give to it
structur the largest possibl logic uniti the practic for
exampl of see in a distanc two mark posit on a
practic rigid bodi is someth which is lodg deepli in our habit
of thought we ar accustom further to regard three point as be
situat on a straight line if their appar posit can be made to
coincid for observ with on ey under suitabl choic of our
place of observ
if in pursuanc of our habit of thought we now supplement the
proposit of euclidean geometri by the singl proposit that two
point on a practic rigid bodi alwai correspond to the same
distanc lineinterv independ of ani chang in posit to
which we mai subject the bodi the proposit of euclidean geometri
then resolv themselv into proposit on the possibl rel
posit of practic rigid bodies1 geometri which ha been
supplement in thi wai is then to be treat as a branch of physic
we can now legitim ask as to the truth of geometr
proposit interpret in thi wai sinc we ar justifi in ask
whether these proposit ar satisfi for those real thing we have
associ with the geometr idea in less exact term we can
express thi by sai that by the truth of a geometr proposit
in thi sens we understand it valid for a construct with rule
and compass
1 it follow that a natur object is associ also with a
straight line three point a b and c on a rigid bodi thu lie in
a straight line when the point a and c be given b is chosen
such that the sum of the distanc ab and bc is as short as
possibl thi incomplet suggest will suffic for the present
purpos
of cours the convict of the truth of geometr proposit in
thi sens is found exclus on rather incomplet experi for
the present we shall assum the truth of the geometr
proposit then at a later stage in the gener theori of
rel we shall see that thi truth is limit and we shall
consid the extent of it limit
ii
the system of coordin
on the basi of the physic interpret of distanc which ha been
indic we ar also in a posit to establish the distanc between
two point on a rigid bodi by mean of measur for thi purpos
we requir a distanc rod s which is to be us onc and for all
and which we emploi as a standard measur if now a and b ar two
point on a rigid bodi we can construct the line join them
accord to the rule of geometri then start from a we can
mark off the distanc s time after time until we reach b the
number of these oper requir is the numer measur of the
distanc ab thi is the basi of all measur of length2
2 here we have assum that there is noth left over ie that
the measur give a whole number thi difficulti is got over by
the us of divid measuringrod the introduct of which doe not
demand ani fundament new method
everi descript of the scene of an event or of the posit of an
object in space is base on the specif of the point on a rigid
bodi bodi of refer with which that event or object coincid
thi appli not onli to scientif descript but also to everydai
life if i analys the place specif trafalgar squar
london3 i arriv at the follow result the earth is the rigid
bodi to which the specif of place refer trafalgar squar
london is a welldefin point to which a name ha been assign and
with which the event coincid in space4
3
i have chosen thi as be more familiar to the english reader than
the potzdamm platz berlin which is refer to in the origin
r w l
4 it is not necessari here to investig further the signific
of the express coincid in space thi concept is
suffici obviou to ensur that differ of opinion ar
scarc like to aris as to it applic in practic
thi primit method of place specif deal onli with place on
the surfac of rigid bodi and is depend on the exist of
point on thi surfac which ar distinguish from each other but
we can free ourselv from both of these limit without alter
the natur of our specif of posit if for instanc a cloud
is hover over trafalgar squar then we can determin it posit
rel to the surfac of the earth by erect a pole perpendicularli
on the squar so that it reach the cloud the length of the pole
measur with the standard measuringrod combin with the
specif of the posit of the foot of the pole suppli us with
a complet place specif on the basi of thi illustr we
ar abl to see the manner in which a refin of the concept of
posit ha been develop
a we imagin the rigid bodi to which the place specif is
refer supplement in such a manner that the object whose posit
we requir is reach by the complet rigid bodi
b in locat the posit of the object we make us of a number
here the length of the pole measur with the measuringrod instead
of design point of refer
c we speak of the height of the cloud even when the pole which
reach the cloud ha not been erect by mean of optic
observ of the cloud from differ posit on the ground and
take into account the properti of the propag of light we
determin the length of the pole we should have requir in order to
reach the cloud
from thi consider we see that it will be advantag if in the
descript of posit it should be possibl by mean of numer
measur to make ourselv independ of the exist of mark
posit possess name on the rigid bodi of refer in the
physic of measur thi is attain by the applic of the
cartesian system of coordin
thi consist of three plane surfac perpendicular to each other and
rigidli attach to a rigid bodi refer to a system of coordin
the scene of ani event will be determin for the main part by the
specif of the length of the three perpendicular or
coordin x y z which can be drop from the scene of the
event to those three plane surfac the length of these three
perpendicular can be determin by a seri of manipul with
rigid measuringrod perform accord to the rule and method laid
down by euclidean geometri
in practic the rigid surfac which constitut the system of
coordin ar gener not avail furthermor the magnitud
of the coordin ar not actual determin by construct with
rigid rod but by indirect mean if the result of physic and
astronomi ar to maintain their clear the physic mean of
specif of posit must alwai be sought in accord with the
abov considerations5
5 a refin and modif of these view doe not becom
necessari until we come to deal with the gener theori of rel
treat in the second part of thi book
we thu obtain the follow result everi descript of event in
space involv the us of a rigid bodi to which such event have to be
refer the result relationship take for grant that the law of
euclidean geometri hold for distanc the distanc be
repres physic by mean of the convent of two mark on a
rigid bodi
iii
space and time in classic mechan
the purpos of mechan is to describ how bodi chang their
posit in space with time i should load my conscienc with grave
sin against the sacr spirit of lucid were i to formul the aim
of mechan in thi wai without seriou reflect and detail
explan let us proce to disclos these sin
it is not clear what is to be understood here by posit and
space i stand at the window of a railwai carriag which is
travel uniformli and drop a stone on the embank without
throw it then disregard the influenc of the air resist i
see the stone descend in a straight line a pedestrian who observ the
misde from the footpath notic that the stone fall to earth in a
parabol curv i now ask do the posit travers by the stone
lie in realiti on a straight line or on a parabola moreov what is
meant here by motion in space from the consider of the
previou section the answer is selfevid in the first place we
entir shun the vagu word space of which we must honestli
acknowledg we cannot form the slightest concept and we replac it
by motion rel to a practic rigid bodi of refer the
posit rel to the bodi of refer railwai carriag or
embank have alreadi been defin in detail in the preced
section if instead of bodi of refer we insert system of
coordin which is a us idea for mathemat descript we
ar in a posit to sai the stone travers a straight line rel
to a system of coordin rigidli attach to the carriag but
rel to a system of coordin rigidli attach to the ground
embank it describ a parabola with the aid of thi exampl it
is clearli seen that there is no such thing as an independ
exist trajectori lit pathcurve6 but onli a trajectori
rel to a particular bodi of refer
6 that is a curv along which the bodi move
in order to have a complet descript of the motion we must
specifi how the bodi alter it posit with time ie for everi
point on the trajectori it must be state at what time the bodi is
situat there these data must be supplement by such a definit of
time that in virtu of thi definit these timevalu can be
regard essenti as magnitud result of measur capabl of
observ if we take our stand on the ground of classic mechan
we can satisfi thi requir for our illustr in the follow
manner we imagin two clock of ident construct the man at the
railwaycarriag window is hold on of them and the man on the
footpath the other each of the observ determin the posit on
hi own referencebodi occupi by the stone at each tick of the clock
he is hold in hi hand in thi connect we have not taken account
of the inaccuraci involv by the finit of the veloc of
propag of light with thi and with a second difficulti prevail
here we shall have to deal in detail later
iv the galileian system of coordin
as is well known the fundament law of the mechan of
galileinewton which is known as the law of inertia can be state
thu a bodi remov suffici far from other bodi continu in a
state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line thi law not
onli sai someth about the motion of the bodi but it also
indic the referencebodi or system of coordin permiss
in mechan which can be us in mechan descript the visibl
fix star ar bodi for which the law of inertia certainli hold to
a high degre of approxim now if we us a system of coordin
which is rigidli attach to the earth then rel to thi system
everi fix star describ a circl of immens radiu in the cours of
an astronom dai a result which is oppos to the statement of the
law of inertia so that if we adher to thi law we must refer these
motion onli to system of coordin rel to which the fix
star do not move in a circl a system of coordin of which the
state of motion is such that the law of inertia hold rel to it is
call a galileian system of coordin the law of the mechan
of galileinewton can be regard as valid onli for a galileian system
of coordin
v
the principl of rel in the restrict sens
in order to attain the greatest possibl clear let us return to
our exampl of the railwai carriag suppos to be travel
uniformli we call it motion a uniform translat uniform becaus
it is of constant veloc and direct translat becaus
although the carriag chang it posit rel to the embank
yet it doe not rotat in so do let us imagin a raven fly
through the air in such a manner that it motion as observ from the
embank is uniform and in a straight line if we were to observ
the fly raven from the move railwai carriag we should find that
the motion of the raven would be on of differ veloc and
direct but that it would still be uniform and in a straight line
express in an abstract manner we mai sai if a mass m is move
uniformli in a straight line with respect to a coordin system k
then it will also be move uniformli and in a straight line rel
to a second coordin system k provid that the latter is
execut a uniform translatori motion with respect to k in
accord with the discuss contain in the preced section it
follow that
if k is a galileian coordin system then everi other coordin
system k is a galileian on when in relat to k it is in a
condit of uniform motion of translat rel to k the
mechan law of galileinewton hold good exactli as thei do with
respect to k
we advanc a step farther in our generalis when we express the
tenet thu if rel to k k is a uniformli move coordin
system devoid of rotat then natur phenomena run their cours with
respect to k accord to exactli the same gener law as with
respect to k thi statement is call the principl of rel
in the restrict sens
as long as on wa convinc that all natur phenomena were capabl of
represent with the help of classic mechan there wa no need
to doubt the valid of thi principl of rel but in view of
the more recent develop of electrodynam and optic it becam
more and more evid that classic mechan afford an insuffici
foundat for the physic descript of all natur phenomena at
thi junctur the question of the valid of the principl of
rel becam ripe for discuss and it did not appear imposs
that the answer to thi question might be in the neg
nevertheless there ar two gener fact which at the outset speak
veri much in favour of the valid of the principl of rel
even though classic mechan doe not suppli us with a suffici
broad basi for the theoret present of all physic phenomena
still we must grant it a consider measur of truth sinc it
suppli us with the actual motion of the heavenli bodi with a
delicaci of detail littl short of wonder the principl of
rel must therefor appli with great accuraci in the domain of
mechan but that a principl of such broad gener should hold
with such exact in on domain of phenomena and yet should be
invalid for anoth is a priori not veri probabl
we now proce to the second argument to which moreov we shall
return later if the principl of rel in the restrict sens
doe not hold then the galileian coordin system k k k
etc which ar move uniformli rel to each other will not be
equival for the descript of natur phenomena in thi case we
should be constrain to believ that natur law ar capabl of be
formul in a particularli simpl manner and of cours onli on
condit that from amongst all possibl galileian coordin
system we should have chosen on k0 of a particular state of
motion as our bodi of refer we should then be justifi becaus
of it merit for the descript of natur phenomena in call thi
system absolut at rest and all other galileian system k in
motion if for instanc our embank were the system k0 then our
railwai carriag would be a system k rel to which less simpl
law would hold than with respect to k0 thi diminish simplic
would be due to the fact that the carriag k would be in motion
ie reallywith respect to k0 in the gener law of natur
which have been formul with refer to k the magnitud and
direct of the veloc of the carriag would necessarili plai a
part we should expect for instanc that the note emit by an
organpip place with it axi parallel to the direct of travel
would be differ from that emit if the axi of the pipe were
place perpendicular to thi direct
now in virtu of it motion in an orbit round the sun our earth is
compar with a railwai carriag travel with a veloc of about
30 kilometr per second if the principl of rel were not valid
we should therefor expect that the direct of motion of the earth at
ani moment would enter into the law of natur and also that physic
system in their behaviour would be depend on the orient in
space with respect to the earth for ow to the alter in
direct of the veloc of revolut of the earth in the cours of a
year the earth cannot be at rest rel to the hypothet system
k0 throughout the whole year howev the most care observ
have never reveal such anisotrop properti in terrestri physic
space ie a physic nonequival of differ direct thi
is veri power argument in favour of the principl of rel
vi
the theorem of the addit of veloc emploi in classic
mechan
let us suppos our old friend the railwai carriag to be travel
along the rail with a constant veloc v and that a man travers
the length of the carriag in the direct of travel with a veloc
w how quickli or in other word with what veloc w doe the
man advanc rel to the embank dure the process the onli
possibl answer seem to result from the follow consider if
the man were to stand still for a second he would advanc rel to
the embank through a distanc v equal numer to the veloc
of the carriag as a consequ of hi walk howev he travers
an addit distanc w rel to the carriag and henc also
rel to the embank in thi second the distanc w be
numer equal to the veloc with which he is walk thu in
total he cover the distanc w v w rel to the embank in
the second consid we shall see later that thi result which
express the theorem of the addit of veloc emploi in
classic mechan cannot be maintain in other word the law that
we have just written down doe not hold in realiti for the time be
howev we shall assum it correct
vii
the appar incompat of the law of propag of light with
the principl of rel
there is hardli a simpler law in physic than that accord to which
light is propag in empti space everi child at school know or
believ he know that thi propag take place in straight line
with a veloc c 300000 kmsec at all event we know with great
exact that thi veloc is the same for all colour becaus if
thi were not the case the minimum of emiss would not be observ
simultan for differ colour dure the eclips of a fix star
by it dark neighbour by mean of similar consider base on
observ of doubl star the dutch astronom de sitter wa also
abl to show that the veloc of propag of light cannot depend on
the veloc of motion of the bodi emit the light the assumpt
that thi veloc of propag is depend on the direct in
space is in itself improb
in short let us assum that the simpl law of the constanc of the
veloc of light c in vacuum is justifi believ by the child
at school who would imagin that thi simpl law ha plung the
conscienti thought physicist into the greatest intellectu
difficulti let us consid how these difficulti aris
of cours we must refer the process of the propag of light and
inde everi other process to a rigid referencebodi coordin
system as such a system let us again choos our embank we shall
imagin the air abov it to have been remov if a rai of light be
sent along the embank we see from the abov that the tip of the
rai will be transmit with the veloc c rel to the
embank now let us suppos that our railwai carriag is again
travel along the railwai line with the veloc v and that it
direct is the same as that of the rai of light but it veloc of
cours much less let us inquir about the veloc of propag of
the rai of light rel to the carriag it is obviou that we can
here appli the consider of the previou section sinc the rai of
light plai the part of the man walk along rel to the
carriag the veloc w of the man rel to the embank is
here replac by the veloc of light rel to the embank w
is the requir veloc of light with respect to the carriag and we
have
w c v
the veloc of propag ot a rai of light rel to the carriag
thu come out smaller than c
but thi result come into conflict with the principl of rel
set forth in section v for like everi other gener law of natur
the law of the transmiss of light in vacuo in vacuum must
accord to the principl of rel be the same for the railwai
carriag as referencebodi as when the rail ar the bodi of refer
but from our abov consider thi would appear to be imposs
if everi rai of light is propag rel to the embank with the
veloc c then for thi reason it would appear that anoth law of
propag of light must necessarili hold with respect to the
carriagea result contradictori to the principl of rel
in view of thi dilemma there appear to be noth els for it than to
abandon either the principl of rel or the simpl law of the
propag of light in vacuo those of you who have carefulli
follow the preced discuss ar almost sure to expect that we
should retain the principl of rel which appeal so
convincingli to the intellect becaus it is so natur and simpl the
law of the propag of light in vacuo would then have to be
replac by a more complic law conform to the principl of
rel the develop of theoret physic show howev that
we cannot pursu thi cours the epochmak theoret
investig of h a lorentz on the electrodynam and optic
phenomena connect with move bodi show that experi in thi
domain lead conclus to a theori of electromagnet phenomena of
which the law of the constanc of the veloc of light in vacuo is a
necessari consequ promin theoret physicist were therefor
more inclin to reject the principl of rel in spite of the
fact that no empir data had been found which were contradictori to
thi principl
at thi junctur the theori of rel enter the arena as a
result of an analysi of the physic concept of time and space it
becam evid that in realiti there is not the least incompatibilitii
between the principl of rel and the law of propag of
light and that by systemat hold fast to both these law a
logic rigid theori could be arriv at thi theori ha been call
the special theori of rel to distinguish it from the extend
theori with which we shall deal later in the follow page we shall
present the fundament idea of the special theori of rel
viii
on the idea of time in physic
lightn ha struck the rail on our railwai embank at two place
a and b far distant from each other i make the addit
assert that these two lightn flash occur simultan if
i ask you whether there is sens in thi statement you will answer my
question with a decid ye but if i now approach you with the
request to explain to me the sens of the statement more precis you
find after some consider that the answer to thi question is not
so easi as it appear at first sight
after some time perhap the follow answer would occur to you the
signific of the statement is clear in itself and need no further
explan of cours it would requir some consider if i were to
be commiss to determin by observ whether in the actual case
the two event took place simultan or not i cannot be satisfi
with thi answer for the follow reason suppos that as a result
of ingeni consider an abl meteorologist were to discov that
the lightn must alwai strike the place a and b simultan
then we should be face with the task of test whether or not thi
theoret result is in accord with the realiti we encount the
same difficulti with all physic statement in which the concept
simultan plai a part the concept doe not exist for the
physicist until he ha the possibl of discov whether or not it
is fulfil in an actual case we thu requir a definit of
simultan such that thi definit suppli us with the method by
mean of which in the present case he can decid by experi
whether or not both the lightn stroke occur simultan as
long as thi requir is not satisfi i allow myself to be
deceiv as a physicist and of cours the same appli if i am not a
physicist when i imagin that i am abl to attach a mean to the
statement of simultan i would ask the reader not to proce
farther until he is fulli convinc on thi point
after think the matter over for some time you then offer the
follow suggest with which to test simultan by measur
along the rail the connect line ab should be measur up and an
observ place at the midpoint m of the distanc ab thi observ
should be suppli with an arrang eg two mirror inclin at
90 which allow him visual to observ both place a and b at
the same time if the observ perceiv the two flash of lightn
at the same time then thei ar simultan
i am veri pleas with thi suggest but for all that i cannot
regard the matter as quit settl becaus i feel constrain to rais
the follow object your definit would certainli be right if
onli i knew that the light by mean of which the observ at m
perceiv the lightn flash travel along the length a m with
the same veloc as along the length b m but an examin of
thi supposit would onli be possibl if we alreadi had at our
dispos the mean of measur time it would thu appear as though we
were move here in a logic circl
after further consider you cast a somewhat disdain glanc at
meand rightli soand you declar i maintain my previou definit
nevertheless becaus in realiti it assum absolut noth about
light there is onli on demand to be made of the definit of
simultan name that in everi real case it must suppli us with an
empir decis as to whether or not the concept that ha to be
defin is fulfil that my definit satisfi thi demand is
indisput that light requir the same time to travers the path
a m as for the path b m is in realiti neither a
supposit nor a hypothesi about the physic natur of light but
a stipul which i can make of my own freewil in order to arriv
at a definit of simultan
it is clear that thi definit can be us to give an exact mean
not onli to two event but to as mani event as we care to choos
and independ of the posit of the scene of the event with
respect to the bodi of reference7 here the railwai embank we
ar thu led also to a definit of time in physic for thi
purpos we suppos that clock of ident construct ar place at
the point a b and c of the railwai line coordin system and
that thei ar set in such a manner that the posit of their pointer
ar simultan in the abov sens the same under these
condit we understand by the time of an event the read
posit of the hand of that on of these clock which is in the
immedi vicin in space of the event in thi manner a timevalu
is associ with everi event which is essenti capabl of
observ
7 we suppos further that when three event a b and c occur in
differ place in such a manner that if a is simultan with
b and b is simultan with c simultan in the sens of
the abov definit then the criterion for the simultan of the
pair of event a c is also satisfi thi assumpt is a physic
hypothesi about the law of propag of light it must certainli be
fulfil if we ar to maintain the law of the constanc of the
veloc of light in vacuo
thi stipul contain a further physic hypothesi the valid
of which will hardli be doubt without empir evid to the
contrari it ha been assum that all these clock go at the same
rate if thei ar of ident construct state more exactli when
two clock arrang at rest in differ place of a referencebodi ar
set in such a manner that a particular posit of the pointer of
the on clock is simultan in the abov sens with the same
posit of the pointer of the other clock then ident set
ar alwai simultan in the sens of the abov definit
ix
the rel of simultan
up to now our consider have been refer to a particular bodi of
refer which we have style a railwai embank we suppos a
veri long train travel along the rail with the constant veloc v
and in the direct indic in fig 1 peopl travel in thi
train will with a vantag view the train as a rigid referencebodi
coordin system thei regard all event in refer to the train
then everi event which take place along the line also take place at a
particular point of the train also the definit of simultan can
be given rel to the train in exactli the same wai as with respect
to the embank as a natur consequ howev the follow
question aris
image001
ar two event eg the two stroke of lightn a and b which
ar simultan with refer to the railwai embank also
simultan rel to the train we shall show directli that the
answer must be in the neg
when we sai that the lightn stroke a and b ar simultan
with respect to be embank we mean the rai of light emit at
the place a and b where the lightn occur meet each other at
the midpoint m of the length a b of the embank but the
event a and b also correspond to posit a and b on the
train let m be the midpoint of the distanc a b on the
travel train just when the flash as judg from the embank
of lightn occur thi point m natur coincid with the point
m but it move toward the right in the diagram with the veloc v
of the train if an observ sit in the posit m in the train
did not possess thi veloc then he would remain perman at m
and the light rai emit by the flash of lightn a and b
would reach him simultan ie thei would meet just where he is
situat now in realiti consid with refer to the railwai
embank he is hasten toward the beam of light come from b
whilst he is ride on ahead of the beam of light come from a
henc the observ will see the beam of light emit from b earlier
than he will see that emit from a observ who take the railwai
train as their referencebodi must therefor come to the conclus
that the lightn flash b took place earlier than the lightn
flash a we thu arriv at the import result
event which ar simultan with refer to the embank ar not
simultan with respect to the train and vice versa rel of
simultan everi referencebodi coordin system ha it own
particular time unless we ar told the referencebodi to which the
statement of time refer there is no mean in a statement of the
time of an event
now befor the advent of the theori of rel it had alwai tacitli
been assum in physic that the statement of time had an absolut
signific ie that it is independ of the state of motion of
the bodi of refer but we have just seen that thi assumpt is
incompat with the most natur definit of simultan if we
discard thi assumpt then the conflict between the law of the
propag of light in vacuo and the principl of rel
develop in section vii disappear
we were led to that conflict by the consider of section vi which
ar now no longer tenabl in that section we conclud that the man in
the carriag who travers the distanc w per second rel to the
carriag travers the same distanc also with respect to the
embank in each second of time but accord to the forego
consider the time requir by a particular occurr with
respect to the carriag must not be consid equal to the durat of
the same occurr as judg from the embank as referencebodi
henc it cannot be contend that the man in walk travel the
distanc w rel to the railwai line in a time which is equal to
on second as judg from the embank
moreov the consider of section vi ar base on yet a second
assumpt which in the light of a strict consider appear to
be arbitrari although it wa alwai tacitli made even befor the
introduct of the theori of rel
x
on the rel of the concept of distanc
let us consid two particular point on the train 8 travel along
the embank with the veloc v and inquir as to their distanc
apart we alreadi know that it is necessari to have a bodi of refer
for the measur of a distanc with respect to which bodi the
distanc can be measur up it is the simplest plan to us the train
itself as referencebodi coordin system an observ in the train
measur the interv by mark off hi measuringrod in a straight
line eg along the floor of the carriag as mani time as is
necessari to take him from the on mark point to the other then the
number which tell us how often the rod ha to be laid down is the
requir distanc
8 eg the middl of the first and of the hundredth carriag
it is a differ matter when the distanc ha to be judg from the
railwai line here the follow method suggest itself if we call
a and b the two point on the train whose distanc apart is
requir then both of these point ar move with the veloc v
along the embank in the first place we requir to determin the
point a and b of the embank which ar just be pass by the
two point a and b at a particular time tjudg from the
embank these point a and b of the embank can be
determin by appli the definit of time given in section viii
the distanc between these point a and b is then measur by repeat
applic of the measuringrod along the embank
a priori it is by no mean certain that thi last measur will
suppli us with the same result as the first thu the length of the
train as measur from the embank mai be differ from that
obtain by measur in the train itself thi circumst lead us
to a second object which must be rais against the appar
obviou consider of section vi name if the man in the carriag
cover the distanc w in a unit of timemeasur from the
trainthen thi distancea measur from the embank is not
necessarili also equal to w
xi
the lorentz transform
the result of the last three section show that the appar
incompat of the law of propag of light with the principl
of rel section vii ha been deriv by mean of a
consider which borrow two unjustifi hypothes from
classic mechan these ar as follow
1 the timeinterv time between two event is independ of the
condit of motion of the bodi of refer
2 the spaceinterv distanc between two point of a rigid bodi is
independ of the condit of motion of the bodi of refer
if we drop these hypothes then the dilemma of section vii
disappear becaus the theorem of the addit of veloc deriv
in section vi becom invalid the possibl present itself that the
law of the propag of light in vacuo mai be compat with the
principl of rel and the question aris how have we to modifi
the consider of section vi in order to remov the appar
disagr between these two fundament result of experi thi
question lead to a gener on in the discuss of section vi we
have to do with place and time rel both to the train and to the
embank how ar we to find the place and time of an event in
relat to the train when we know the place and time of the event
with respect to the railwai embank is there a thinkabl answer to
thi question of such a natur that the law of transmiss of light
in vacuo doe not contradict the principl of rel in other
word can we conceiv of a relat between place and time of the
individu event rel to both referencebodi such that everi
rai of light possess the veloc of transmiss c rel to the
embank and rel to the train thi question lead to a quit
definit posit answer and to a perfectli definit transform
law for the spacetim magnitud of an event when chang over from
on bodi of refer to anoth
befor we deal with thi we shall introduc the follow incident
consider up to the present we have onli consid event take
place along the embank which had mathemat to assum the
function of a straight line in the manner indic in section ii we
can imagin thi referencebodi supplement later and in a
vertic direct by mean of a framework of rod so that an event
which take place anywher can be localis with refer to thi
framework similarli we can imagin the train travel with the
veloc v to be continu across the whole of space so that everi
event no matter how far off it mai be could also be localis with
respect to the second framework without commit ani fundament
error we can disregard the fact that in realiti these framework would
continu interfer with each other ow to the impenetr of
solid bodi in everi such framework we imagin three surfac
perpendicular to each other mark out and design as coordin
plane coordin system a coordin system k then
correspond to the embank and a coordin system k to the
train an event wherev it mai have taken place would be fix in
space with respect to k by the three perpendicular x y z on the
coordin plane and with regard to time by a time valu t
rel to k the same event would be fix in respect of space and
time by correspond valu x y z t which of cours ar not
ident with x y z t it ha alreadi been set forth in detail
how these magnitud ar to be regard as result of physic
measur
image002
obvious our problem can be exactli formul in the follow
manner what ar the valu x y z t of an event with respect
to k when the magnitud x y z t of the same event with
respect to k ar given the relat must be so chosen that the law
of the transmiss of light in vacuo is satisfi for on and the same
rai of light and of cours for everi rai with respect to k and
k for the rel orient in space of the coordin system
indic in the diagram fig 2 thi problem is solv by mean of
the equat
image003
y y
z z
image004
thi system of equat is known as the lorentz transformation9
9 a simpl deriv of the lorentz transform is given in
appendix i
if in place of the law of transmiss of light we had taken as our
basi the tacit assumpt of the older mechan as to the absolut
charact of time and length then instead of the abov we should
have obtain the follow equat
x x vt
y y
z z
t t
thi system of equat is often term the galilei transform
the galilei transform can be obtain from the lorentz
transform by substitut an infinit larg valu for the
veloc of light c in the latter transform
aid by the follow illustr we can readili see that in
accord with the lorentz transform the law of the transmiss
of light in vacuo is satisfi both for the referencebodi k and
for the referencebodi k a lightsign is sent along the posit
xaxi and thi lightstimulu advanc in accord with the
equat
x ct
ie with the veloc c accord to the equat of the lorentz
transform thi simpl relat between x and t involv a
relat between x and t in point of fact if we substitut for
x the valu ct in the first and fourth equat of the lorentz
transform we obtain
image005
from which by divis the express
x ct
immedi follow if refer to the system k the propag of
light take place accord to thi equat we thu see that the
veloc of transmiss rel to the referencebodi k is also
equal to c the same result is obtain for rai of light advanc
in ani other direct whatsoev of caus thi is not surpris
sinc the equat of the lorentz transform were deriv
conform to thi point of view
xii
the behaviour of measuringrod and clock in motion
place a metrerod in the xaxi of k in such a manner that on
end the begin coincid with the point x 0 whilst the other
end the end of the rod coincid with the point x 1 what is the
length of the metrerod rel to the system k in order to learn
thi we need onli ask where the begin of the rod and the end of
the rod lie with respect to k at a particular time t of the system
k by mean of the first equat of the lorentz transform the
valu of these two point at the time t 0 can be shown to be
image006
the distanc between the point be
image007
but the metrerod is move with the veloc v rel to k it
therefor follow that the length of a rigid metrerod move in the
direct of it length with a veloc v is
image008
of a metr the rigid rod is thu shorter when in motion than when at
rest and the more quickli it is move the shorter is the rod for
the veloc v c we should have
image009
and for still greater veloc the squareroot becom imaginari
from thi we conclud that in the theori of rel the veloc c
plai the part of a limit veloc which can neither be reach nor
exceed by ani real bodi
of cours thi featur of the veloc c as a limit veloc also
clearli follow from the equat of the lorentz transform for
these becam meaningless if we choos valu of v greater than c
if on the contrari we had consid a metrerod at rest in the
xaxi with respect to k then we should have found that the length
of the rod as judg from k would have been
image010
thi is quit in accord with the principl of rel which
form the basi of our consider
a priori it is quit clear that we must be abl to learn someth
about the physic behaviour of measuringrod and clock from the
equat of transform for the magnitud z y x t ar
noth more nor less than the result of measur obtain by
mean of measuringrod and clock if we had base our consider
on the galileian transform we should not have obtain a
contract of the rod as a consequ of it motion
let us now consid a secondsclock which is perman situat at
the origin x 0 of k t 0 and t 1 ar two success
tick of thi clock the first and fourth equat of the lorentz
transform give for these two tick
t 0
and
image011
as judg from k the clock is move with the veloc v as
judg from thi referencebodi the time which elaps between two
stroke of the clock is not on second but
image012
second ie a somewhat larger time as a consequ of it motion
the clock goe more slowli than when at rest here also the veloc
c plai the part of an unattain limit veloc
xiii
theorem of the addit of veloc the experi of fizeau
now in practic we can move clock and measuringrod onli with
veloc that ar small compar with the veloc of light henc we
shall hardli be abl to compar the result of the previou section
directli with the realiti but on the other hand these result must
strike you as be veri singular and for that reason i shall now draw
anoth conclus from the theori on which can easili be deriv
from the forego consider and which ha been most elegantli
confirm by experi
in section vi we deriv the theorem of the addit of veloc in
on direct in the form which also result from the hypothes of
classic mechan thi theorem can also be deduc readili from the
galilei transform section xi in place of the man walk insid
the carriag we introduc a point move rel to the coordin
system k in accord with the equat
x wt
by mean of the first and fourth equat of the galilei
transform we can express x and t in term of x and t
and we then obtain
x v wt
thi equat express noth els than the law of motion of the
point with refer to the system k of the man with refer to
the embank we denot thi veloc by the symbol w and we then
obtain as in section vi
w v w a
but we can carri out thi consider just as well on the basi of
the theori of rel in the equat
x wt
we must then express x and t in term of x and t make us
of the first and fourth equat of the lorentz transform
instead of the equat a we then obtain the equat
image013
which correspond to the theorem of addit for veloc in on
direct accord to the theori of rel the question now
aris as to which of these two theorem is the better in accord with
experi on thi point we ar enlighten by a most import
experi which the brilliant physicist fizeau perform more than
half a centuri ago and which ha been repeat sinc then by some of
the best experiment physicist so that there can be no doubt about
it result the experi is concern with the follow question
light travel in a motionless liquid with a particular veloc w
how quickli doe it travel in the direct of the arrow in the tube
t see the accompani diagram fig 3 when the liquid abov
mention is flow through the tube with a veloc v
image014
in accord with the principl of rel we shall certainli have
to take for grant that the propag of light alwai take place
with the same veloc w with respect to the liquid whether the
latter is in motion with refer to other bodi or not the veloc
of light rel to the liquid and the veloc of the latter rel
to the tube ar thu known and we requir the veloc of light
rel to the tube
it is clear that we have the problem of section vi again befor us the
tube plai the part of the railwai embank or of the coordin
system k the liquid plai the part of the carriag or of the
coordin system k and final the light plai the part of the
man walk along the carriag or of the move point in the present
section if we denot the veloc of the light rel to the tube by
w then thi is given by the equat a or b accord as the
galilei transform or the lorentz transform correspond to the
fact experiment10 decid in favour of equat b deriv from
the theori of rel and the agreement is inde veri exact
accord to recent and most excel measur by zeeman the
influenc of the veloc of flow v on the propag of light is
repres by formula b to within on per cent
10 fizeau found
image015
where
image016
is the index of refract of the liquid on the other hand ow to
the small of
image017
as compar with 1 we can replac b in the first place by
image018
or to the same order of approxim by
image019
which agre with fizeau result
nevertheless we must now draw attent to the fact that a theori of
thi phenomenon wa given by h a lorentz long befor the statement of
the theori of rel thi theori wa of a pure electrodynam
natur and wa obtain by the us of particular hypothes as to the
electromagnet structur of matter thi circumst howev doe
not in the least diminish the conclus of the experi as a
crucial test in favour of the theori of rel for the
electrodynam of maxwelllorentz on which the origin theori wa
base in no wai oppos the theori of rel rather ha the
latter been develop trom electrodynam as an astoundingli simpl
combin and generalis of the hypothes formerli independ
of each other on which electrodynam wa built
xiv
the heurist valu of the theori of rel
our train of thought in the forego page can be epitomis in the
follow manner experi ha led to the convict that on the on
hand the principl of rel hold true and that on the other hand
the veloc of transmiss of light in vacuo ha to be consid
equal to a constant c by unit these two postul we obtain
the law of transform for the rectangular coordin x y z
and the time t of the event which constitut the process of
natur in thi connect we did not obtain the galilei
transform but differ from classic mechan the lorentz
transform
the law of transmiss of light the accept of which is justifi
by our actual knowledg plai an import part in thi process of
thought onc in possess of the lorentz transform howev we
can combin thi with the principl of rel and sum up the
theori thu
everi gener law of natur must be so constitut that it is
transform into a law of exactli the same form when instead of the
spacetim variabl x y z t of the origin coordin system
k we introduc new spacetim variabl x y z t of a
coordin system k in thi connect the relat between the
ordinari and the accent magnitud is given by the lorentz
transform or in brief gener law of natur ar covari with
respect to lorentz transform
thi is a definit mathemat condit that the theori of rel
demand of a natur law and in virtu of thi the theori becom a
valuabl heurist aid in the search for gener law of natur if a
gener law of natur were to be found which did not satisfi thi
condit then at least on of the two fundament assumpt of the
theori would have been disprov let us now examin what gener
result the latter theori ha hitherto evinc
xv
gener result of the theori
it is clear from our previou consider that the special theori
of rel ha grown out of electrodynam and optic in these
field it ha not appreci alter the predict of theori but it
ha consider simplifi the theoret structur ie the
deriv of law andwhat is incompar more importantit ha
consider reduc the number of independ hypothes form the
basi of theori the special theori of rel ha render the
maxwelllorentz theori so plausibl that the latter would have been
gener accept by physicist even if experi had decid less
unequivoc in it favour
classic mechan requir to be modifi befor it could come into
line with the demand of the special theori of rel for the main
part howev thi modif affect onli the law for rapid
motion in which the veloc of matter v ar not veri small as
compar with the veloc of light we have experi of such rapid
motion onli in the case of electron and ion for other motion the
variat from the law of classic mechan ar too small to make
themselv evid in practic we shall not consid the motion of
star until we come to speak of the gener theori of rel in
accord with the theori of rel the kinet energi of a
materi point of mass m is no longer given by the wellknown
express
image020
but by the express
image021
thi express approach infin as the veloc v approach the
veloc of light c the veloc must therefor alwai remain less
than c howev great mai be the energi us to produc the
acceler if we develop the express for the kinet energi in
the form of a seri we obtain
image022
when
image023
is small compar with uniti the third of these term is alwai small
in comparison with the second which last is alon consid in
classic mechan the first term mc2 doe not contain the
veloc and requir no consider if we ar onli deal with the
question as to how the energi of a pointmass depend on the veloc
we shall speak of it essenti signific later
the most import result of a gener charact to which the special
theori of rel ha led is concern with the concept of mass
befor the advent of rel physic recognis two conserv
law of fundament import name the law of the conserv of
energi and the law of the conserv of mass these two fundament
law appear to be quit independ of each other by mean of the
theori of rel thei have been unit into on law we shall now
briefli consid how thi unif came about and what mean is
to be attach to it
the principl of rel requir that the law of the conserv
of energi should hold not onli with refer to a coordin system
k but also with respect to everi coordin system k which is in
a state of uniform motion of translat rel to k or briefli
rel to everi galileian system of coordin in contrast to
classic mechan the lorentz transform is the decid factor
in the transit from on such system to anoth
by mean of compar simpl consider we ar led to draw the
follow conclus from these premis in conjunct with the
fundament equat of the electrodynam of maxwel a bodi move
with the veloc v which absorbs11 an amount of energi e0 in
the form of radiat without suffer an alter in veloc in
the process ha as a consequ it energi increas by an amount
image024
11 e0 is the energi taken up as judg from a coordin system
move with the bodi
in consider of the express given abov for the kinet energi
of the bodi the requir energi of the bodi come out to be
image025
thu the bodi ha the same energi as a bodi of mass
image026
move with the veloc v henc we can sai if a bodi take up an
amount of energi e0 then it inerti mass increas by an amount
image027
the inerti mass of a bodi is not a constant but vari accord to
the chang in the energi of the bodi the inerti mass of a system of
bodi can even be regard as a measur of it energi the law of the
conserv of the mass of a system becom ident with the law of
the conserv of energi and is onli valid provid that the system
neither take up nor send out energi write the express for the
energi in the form
image028
we see that the term mc2 which ha hitherto attract our attent
is noth els than the energi possess by the body12 befor it
absorb the energi e0
12 as judg from a coordin system move with the bodi
a direct comparison of thi relat with experi is not possibl at
the present time 1920 seenot p 48 ow to the fact that the
chang in energi e0 to which we can subject a system ar not larg
enough to make themselv percept as a chang in the inerti mass
of the system
image027
is too small in comparison with the mass m which wa present befor
the alter of the energi it is ow to thi circumst that
classic mechan wa abl to establish successfulli the conserv
of mass as a law of independ valid
note the equat e mc2 ha been thoroughli prove time and again
sinc thi time
let me add a final remark of a fundament natur the success of the
faradaymaxwel interpret of electromagnet action at a distanc
result in physicist becom convinc that there ar no such thing
as instantan action at a distanc not involv an intermediari
medium of the type of newton law of gravit
accord to the theori of rel action at a distanc with the
veloc of light alwai take the place of instantan action at a
distanc or of action at a distanc with an infinit veloc of
transmiss thi is connect with the fact that the veloc c
plai a fundament role in thi theori in part ii we shall see in
what wai thi result becom modifi in the gener theori of
rel
xvi
experi and the special theori of rel
to what extent is the special theori of rel support by
experi thi question is not easili answer for the reason alreadi
mention in connect with the fundament experi of fizeau the
special theori of rel ha crystallis out from the
maxwelllorentz theori of electromagnet phenomena thu all fact of
experi which support the electromagnet theori also support the
theori of rel as be of particular import i mention here
the fact that the theori of rel enabl us to predict the
effect produc on the light reach us from the fix star these
result ar obtain in an exceedingli simpl manner and the effect
indic which ar due to the rel motion of the earth with
refer to those fix star ar found to be in accord with
experi we refer to the yearli movement of the appar posit of
the fix star result from the motion of the earth round the sun
aberr and to the influenc of the radial compon of the
rel motion of the fix star with respect to the earth on the
colour of the light reach us from them the latter effect manifest
itself in a slight displac of the spectral line of the light
transmit to us from a fix star as compar with the posit of
the same spectral line when thei ar produc by a terrestri sourc
of light doppler principl the experiment argument in favour of
the maxwelllorentz theori which ar at the same time argument in
favour of the theori of rel ar too numer to be set forth
here in realiti thei limit the theoret possibl to such an
extent that no other theori than that of maxwel and lorentz ha been
abl to hold it own when test by experi
but there ar two class of experiment fact hitherto obtain which
can be repres in the maxwelllorentz theori onli by the
introduct of an auxiliari hypothesi which in itselfi without
make us of the theori of relativityappear extran
it is known that cathod rai and the socal rai emit by
radioact substanc consist of neg electrifi particl
electron of veri small inertia and larg veloc by examin the
deflect of these rai under the influenc of electr and magnet
field we can studi the law of motion of these particl veri exactli
in the theoret treatment of these electron we ar face with the
difficulti that electrodynam theori of itself is unabl to give an
account of their natur for sinc electr mass of on sign repel
each other the neg electr mass constitut the electron
would necessarili be scatter under the influenc of their mutual
repuls unless there ar forc of anoth kind oper between
them the natur of which ha hitherto remain obscur to us13 if
we now assum that the rel distanc between the electr mass
constitut the electron remain unchang dure the motion of the
electron rigid connect in the sens of classic mechan we
arriv at a law of motion of the electron which doe not agre with
experi guid by pure formal point of view h a lorentz wa
the first to introduc the hypothesi that the form of the electron
experi a contract in the direct of motion in consequ of
that motion the contract length be proport to the express
image029
thi hypothesi which is not justifi by ani electrodynam
fact suppli us then with that particular law of motion which ha
been confirm with great precis in recent year
13 the gener theori of rel render it like that the
electr mass of an electron ar held togeth by gravit
forc
the theori of rel lead to the same law of motion without
requir ani special hypothesi whatsoev as to the structur and the
behaviour of the electron we arriv at a similar conclus in
section xiii in connect with the experi of fizeau the result of
which is foretold by the theori of rel without the necess of
draw on hypothes as to the physic natur of the liquid
the second class of fact to which we have allud ha refer to the
question whether or not the motion of the earth in space can be made
percept in terrestri experi we have alreadi remark in
section v that all attempt of thi natur led to a neg result
befor the theori of rel wa put forward it wa difficult to
becom reconcil to thi neg result for reason now to be
discuss the inherit prejudic about time and space did not allow
ani doubt to aris as to the prime import of the galileian
transform for chang over from on bodi of refer to anoth
now assum that the maxwelllorentz equat hold for a
referencebodi k we then find that thei do not hold for a
referencebodi k move uniformli with respect to k if we assum
that the relat of the galileian transform exist between the
coordin of k and k it thu appear that of all galileian
coordin system on k correspond to a particular state of
motion is physic uniqu thi result wa interpret physic by
regard k as at rest with respect to a hypothet ther of space
on the other hand all coordin system k move rel to k
were to be regard as in motion with respect to the ther to thi
motion of k against the ther therdrift rel to k were
attribut the more complic law which were suppos to hold
rel to k strictli speak such an therdrift ought also to
be assum rel to the earth and for a long time the effort of
physicist were devot to attempt to detect the exist of an
therdrift at the earth surfac
in on of the most notabl of these attempt michelson devis a method
which appear as though it must be decis imagin two mirror so
arrang on a rigid bodi that the reflect surfac face each other
a rai of light requir a perfectli definit time t to pass from on
mirror to the other and back again if the whole system be at rest with
respect to the ther it is found by calcul howev that a
slightli differ time t is requir for thi process if the bodi
togeth with the mirror be move rel to the ther and yet
anoth point it is shown by calcul that for a given veloc v
with refer to the ther thi time t is differ when the bodi
is move perpendicularli to the plane of the mirror from that
result when the motion is parallel to these plane although the
estim differ between these two time is exceedingli small
michelson and morlei perform an experi involv interfer in
which thi differ should have been clearli detect but the
experi gave a neg resulta fact veri perplex to physicist
lorentz and fitzgerald rescu the theori from thi difficulti by
assum that the motion of the bodi rel to the ther produc a
contract of the bodi in the direct of motion the amount of
contract be just suffici to compens for the differ in
time mention abov comparison with the discuss in section xii
show that also from the standpoint of the theori of rel thi
solut of the difficulti wa the right on but on the basi of the
theori of rel the method of interpret is incompar more
satisfactori accord to thi theori there is no such thing as a
special favour uniqu coordin system to occas the
introduct of the theridea and henc there can be no therdrift
nor ani experi with which to demonstr it here the contract
of move bodi follow from the two fundament principl of the
theori without the introduct of particular hypothes and as the
prime factor involv in thi contract we find not the motion in
itself to which we cannot attach ani mean but the motion with
respect to the bodi of refer chosen in the particular case in
point thu for a coordin system move with the earth the mirror
system of michelson and morlei is not shorten but it is shorten
for a coordin system which is at rest rel to the sun

minkowski fourdimension space
the nonmathematician is seiz by a mysteri shudder when he
hear of fourdimension thing by a feel not unlik that
awaken by thought of the occult and yet there is no more
commonplac statement than that the world in which we live is a
fourdimension spacetim continuum
space is a threedimension continuum by thi we mean that it is
possibl to describ the posit of a point at rest by mean of
three number coordin x y z and that there is an indefinit
number of point in the neighbourhood of thi on the posit of
which can be describ by coordin such as x1 y1 z1 which mai
be as near as we choos to the respect valu of the coordin
x y z of the first point in virtu of the latter properti we
speak of a continuum and ow to the fact that there ar three
coordin we speak of it as be threedimension
similarli the world of physic phenomena which wa briefli call
world by minkowski is natur four dimension in the spacetim
sens for it is compos of individu event each of which is
describ by four number name three space coordin x y z
and a time coordin the time valu t the world is in thi
sens also a continuum for to everi event there ar as mani
neighbour event realis or at least thinkabl as we care to
choos the coordin x1 y1 z1 t1 of which differ by an
indefinit small amount from those of the event x y z t
origin consid that we have not been accustom to regard the
world in thi sens as a fourdimension continuum is due to the fact
that in physic befor the advent of the theori of rel time
plai a differ and more independ rle as compar with the
space coordin it is for thi reason that we have been in the habit
of treat time as an independ continuum as a matter of fact
accord to classic mechan time is absolut ie it is
independ of the posit and the condit of motion of the system
of coordin we see thi express in the last equat of the
galileian transform t t
the fourdimension mode of consider of the world is natur on
the theori of rel sinc accord to thi theori time is rob
of it independ thi is shown by the fourth equat of the
lorentz transform
image030
moreov accord to thi equat the time differ t of two
event with respect to k doe not in gener vanish even when the
time differ t of the same event with refer to k vanish
pure spacedist of two event with respect to k result in
timedist of the same event with respect to k but the
discoveri of minkowski which wa of import for the formal
develop of the theori of rel doe not lie here it is to be
found rather in the fact of hi recognit that the fourdimension
spacetim continuum of the theori of rel in it most essenti
formal properti show a pronounc relationship to the
threedimension continuum of euclidean geometr space14 in
order to give due promin to thi relationship howev we must
replac the usual time coordin t by an imaginari magnitud
image031
proport to it under these condit the natur law satisfi
the demand of the special theori of rel assum mathemat
form in which the time coordin plai exactli the same role as the
three space coordin formal these four coordin correspond
exactli to the three space coordin in euclidean geometri it must
be clear even to the nonmathematician that as a consequ of thi
pure formal addit to our knowledg the theori perforc gain
clear in no mean measur
14 cf the somewhat more detail discuss in appendix ii
these inadequ remark can give the reader onli a vagu notion of the
import idea contribut by minkowski without it the gener theori
of rel of which the fundament idea ar develop in the
follow page would perhap have got no farther than it long
cloth minkowski work is doubtless difficult of access to anyon
inexperienc in mathemat but sinc it is not necessari to have a
veri exact grasp of thi work in order to understand the fundament
idea of either the special or the gener theori of rel i
shall leav it here at present and revert to it onli toward the end
of part ii
part ii the gener theori of rel
xviii
special and gener principl of rel
the basal principl which wa the pivot of all our previou
consider wa the special principl of rel ie the
principl of the physic rel of all uniform motion let as
onc more analys it mean carefulli
it wa at all time clear that from the point of view of the idea it
convei to us everi motion must be consid onli as a rel
motion return to the illustr we have frequent us of the
embank and the railwai carriag we can express the fact of the
motion here take place in the follow two form both of which ar
equal justifi
a the carriag is in motion rel to the embank
b the embank is in motion rel to the carriag
in a the embank in b the carriag serv as the bodi of
refer in our statement of the motion take place if it is simpli
a question of detect or of describ the motion involv it is in
principl immateri to what referencebodi we refer the motion as
alreadi mention thi is selfevid but it must not be confus
with the much more comprehens statement call the principl of
rel which we have taken as the basi of our investig
the principl we have made us of not onli maintain that we mai
equal well choos the carriag or the embank as our
referencebodi for the descript of ani event for thi too is
selfevid our principl rather assert what follow if we
formul the gener law of natur as thei ar obtain from
experi by make us of
a the embank as referencebodi
b the railwai carriag as referencebodi
then these gener law of natur eg the law of mechan or the
law of the propag of light in vacuo have exactli the same form
in both case thi can also be express as follow for the physic
descript of natur process neither of the refer bodi k
k is uniqu lit special mark out as compar with the other
unlik the first thi latter statement need not of necess hold a
priori it is not contain in the concept of motion and
referencebodi and deriv from them onli experi can decid
as to it correct or incorrect
up to the present howev we have by no mean maintain the
equival of all bodi of refer k in connect with the
formul of natur law our cours wa more on the follow
iin in the first place we start out from the assumpt that
there exist a referencebodi k whose condit of motion is such
that the galileian law hold with respect to it a particl left to
itself and suffici far remov from all other particl move
uniformli in a straight line with refer to k galileian
referencebodi the law of natur were to be as simpl as possibl
but in addit to k all bodi of refer k should be given
prefer in thi sens and thei should be exactli equival to k
for the formul of natur law provid that thei ar in a state
of uniform rectilinear and nonrotari motion with respect to k all
these bodi of refer ar to be regard as galileian
referencebodi the valid of the principl of rel wa
assum onli for these referencebodi but not for other eg
those possess motion of a differ kind in thi sens we speak of
the special principl of rel or special theori of rel
in contrast to thi we wish to understand by the gener principl of
rel the follow statement all bodi of refer k k
etc ar equival for the descript of natur phenomena
formul of the gener law of natur whatev mai be their
state of motion but befor proceed farther it ought to be point
out that thi formul must be replac later by a more abstract
on for reason which will becom evid at a later stage
sinc the introduct of the special principl of rel ha been
justifi everi intellect which strive after generalis must feel
the temptat to ventur the step toward the gener principl of
rel but a simpl and appar quit reliabl consider
seem to suggest that for the present at ani rate there is littl
hope of success in such an attempt let us imagin ourselv
transfer to our old friend the railwai carriag which is travel
at a uniform rate as long as it is move uniformli the occup of
the carriag is not sensibl of it motion and it is for thi reason
that he can without reluct interpret the fact of the case as
indic that the carriag is at rest but the embank in motion
moreov accord to the special principl of rel thi
interpret is quit justifi also from a physic point of view
if the motion of the carriag is now chang into a nonuniform motion
as for instanc by a power applic of the brake then the
occup of the carriag experi a correspondingli power jerk
forward the retard motion is manifest in the mechan behaviour
of bodi rel to the person in the railwai carriag the
mechan behaviour is differ from that of the case previous
consid and for thi reason it would appear to be imposs that
the same mechan law hold rel to the nonuniformli move
carriag as hold with refer to the carriag when at rest or in
uniform motion at all event it is clear that the galileian law doe
not hold with respect to the nonuniformli move carriag becaus of
thi we feel compel at the present junctur to grant a kind of
absolut physic realiti to nonuniform motion in opposit to the
gener principl of rel but in what follow we shall soon see
that thi conclus cannot be maintain
xix
the gravit field
if we pick up a stone and then let it go why doe it fall to the
ground the usual answer to thi question is becaus it is attract
by the earth modern physic formul the answer rather differ
for the follow reason as a result of the more care studi of
electromagnet phenomena we have come to regard action at a distanc
as a process imposs without the intervent of some intermediari
medium if for instanc a magnet attract a piec of iron we cannot
be content to regard thi as mean that the magnet act directli on
the iron through the intermedi empti space but we ar constrain
to imagineaft the manner of faradaythat the magnet alwai call
into be someth physic real in the space around it that
someth be what we call a magnet field in it turn thi
magnet field oper on the piec of iron so that the latter
strive to move toward the magnet we shall not discuss here the
justif for thi incident concept which is inde a
somewhat arbitrari on we shall onli mention that with it aid
electromagnet phenomena can be theoret repres much more
satisfactorili than without it and thi appli particularli to the
transmiss of electromagnet wave the effect of gravit also
ar regard in an analog manner
the action of the earth on the stone take place indirectli the earth
produc in it surround a gravit field which act on the
stone and produc it motion of fall as we know from experi the
intens of the action on a bodi dimish accord to a quit
definit law as we proce farther and farther awai from the earth
from our point of view thi mean the law govern the properti of
the gravit field in space must be a perfectli definit on in
order correctli to repres the diminut of gravit action
with the distanc from oper bodi it is someth like thi the
bodi eg the earth produc a field in it immedi neighbourhood
directli the intens and direct of the field at point farther
remov from the bodi ar thenc determin by the law which govern
the properti in space of the gravit field themselv
in contrast to electr and magnet field the gravit field
exhibit a most remark properti which is of fundament import
for what follow bodi which ar move under the sole influenc of a
gravit field receiv an acceler which doe not in the
least depend either on the materi or on the physic state of the
bodi for instanc a piec of lead and a piec of wood fall in
exactli the same manner in a gravit field in vacuo when
thei start off from rest or with the same initi veloc thi law
which hold most accur can be express in a differ form in
the light of the follow consider
accord to newton law of motion we have
forc inerti mass x acceler
where the inerti mass is a characterist constant of the
acceler bodi if now gravit is the caus of the acceler
we then have
forc gravit mass x intens of the gravit
field
where the gravit mass is likewis a characterist constant
for the bodi from these two relat follow
image032
if now as we find from experi the acceler is to be
independ of the natur and the condit of the bodi and alwai the
same for a given gravit field then the ratio of the
gravit to the inerti mass must likewis be the same for all
bodi by a suitabl choic of unit we can thu make thi ratio equal
to uniti we then have the follow law the gravit mass of a
bodi is equal to it inerti mass
it is true that thi import law had hitherto been record in
mechan but it had not been interpret a satisfactori
interpret can be obtain onli if we recognis the follow fact
the same qualiti of a bodi manifest itself accord to
circumst as inertia or as weight lit heavi in the
follow section we shall show to what extent thi is actual the
case and how thi question is connect with the gener postul of
rel
xx
the equal of inerti and gravit mass as an argument for the
gener postul of rel
we imagin a larg portion of empti space so far remov from star
and other appreci mass that we have befor us approxim the
condit requir by the fundament law of galilei it is then
possibl to choos a galileian referencebodi for thi part of space
world rel to which point at rest remain at rest and point in
motion continu perman in uniform rectilinear motion as
referencebodi let us imagin a spaciou chest resembl a room with
an observ insid who is equip with apparatu gravit
natur doe not exist for thi observ he must fasten himself with
string to the floor otherwis the slightest impact against the floor
will caus him to rise slowli toward the ceil of the room
to the middl of the lid of the chest is fix extern a hook with
rope attach and now a be what kind of a be is immateri to
us begin pull at thi with a constant forc the chest togeth
with the observ then begin to move upward with a uniformli
acceler motion in cours of time their veloc will reach
unheardof valuesprovid that we ar view all thi from anoth
referencebodi which is not be pull with a rope
but how doe the man in the chest regard the process the acceler
of the chest will be transmit to him by the reaction of the floor of
the chest he must therefor take up thi pressur by mean of hi leg
if he doe not wish to be laid out full length on the floor he is then
stand in the chest in exactli the same wai as anyon stand in a
room of a home on our earth if he releas a bodi which he previous
had in hi land the accelert of the chest will no longer be
transmit to thi bodi and for thi reason the bodi will approach
the floor of the chest with an acceler rel motion the
observ will further convinc himself that the acceler of the
bodi toward the floor of the chest is alwai of the same magnitud
whatev kind of bodi he mai happen to us for the experi
reli on hi knowledg of the gravit field as it wa
discuss in the preced section the man in the chest will thu
come to the conclus that he and the chest ar in a gravit
field which is constant with regard to time of cours he will be
puzzl for a moment as to why the chest doe not fall in thi
gravit field just then howev he discov the hook in the
middl of the lid of the chest and the rope which is attach to it
and he consequ come to the conclus that the chest is suspend
at rest in the gravit field
ought we to smile at the man and sai that he err in hi conclus i
do not believ we ought to if we wish to remain consist we must
rather admit that hi mode of grasp the situat violat neither
reason nor known mechan law even though it is be acceler
with respect to the galileian space first consid we can
nevertheless regard the chest as be at rest we have thu good
ground for extend the principl of rel to includ bodi of
refer which ar acceler with respect to each other and as a
result we have gain a power argument for a generalis postul
of rel
we must note carefulli that the possibl of thi mode of
interpret rest on the fundament properti of the gravit
field of give all bodi the same acceler or what come to the
same thing on the law of the equal of inerti and gravit
mass if thi natur law did not exist the man in the acceler
chest would not be abl to interpret the behaviour of the bodi around
him on the supposit of a gravit field and he would not be
justifi on the ground of experi in suppos hi referencebodi
to be at rest
suppos that the man in the chest fix a rope to the inner side of the
lid and that he attach a bodi to the free end of the rope the
result of thi will be to stretch the rope so that it will hang
vertic downward if we ask for an opinion of the caus of
tension in the rope the man in the chest will sai the suspend bodi
experi a downward forc in the gravit field and thi is
neutralis by the tension of the rope what determin the magnitud
of the tension of the rope is the gravit mass of the suspend
bodi on the other hand an observ who is pois freeli in space
will interpret the condit of thing thu the rope must perforc
take part in the acceler motion of the chest and it transmit thi
motion to the bodi attach to it the tension of the rope is just
larg enough to effect the acceler of the bodi that which
determin the magnitud of the tension of the rope is the inerti
mass of the bodi guid by thi exampl we see that our extens
of the principl of rel impli the necess of the law of
the equal of inerti and gravit mass thu we have obtain
a physic interpret of thi law
from our consider of the acceler chest we see that a gener
theori of rel must yield import result on the law of
gravit in point of fact the systemat pursuit of the gener
idea of rel ha suppli the law satisfi by the gravit
field befor proceed farther howev i must warn the reader
against a misconcept suggest by these consider a
gravit field exist for the man in the chest despit the fact
that there wa no such field for the coordin system first chosen
now we might easili suppos that the exist of a gravit field
is alwai onli an appar on we might also think that regardless
of the kind of gravit field which mai be present we could
alwai choos anoth referencebodi such that no gravit field
exist with refer to it thi is by no mean true for all
gravit field but onli for those of quit special form it is
for instanc imposs to choos a bodi of refer such that as
judg from it the gravit field of the earth in it entireti
vanish
we can now appreci why that argument is not convinc which we
brought forward against the gener principl of rel at the end
of section xviii it is certainli true that the observ in the railwai
carriag experi a jerk forward as a result of the applic of
the brake and that he recognis in thi the nonuniform of motion
retard of the carriag but he is compel by nobodi to refer
thi jerk to a real acceler retard of the carriag he
might also interpret hi experi thu my bodi of refer the
carriag remain perman at rest with refer to it howev
there exist dure the period of applic of the brake a
gravit field which is direct forward and which is variabl
with respect to time under the influenc of thi field the embank
togeth with the earth move nonuniformli in such a manner that their
origin veloc in the backward direct is continu reduc
xxi
in what respect ar the foundat of classic mechan and of the
special theori of rel unsatisfactori
we have alreadi state sever time that classic mechan start
out from the follow law materi particl suffici far remov
from other materi particl continu to move uniformli in a straight
line or continu in a state of rest we have also repeatedli emphasis
that thi fundament law can onli be valid for bodi of refer k
which possess certain uniqu state of motion and which ar in uniform
translat motion rel to each other rel to other
referencebodi k the law is not valid both in classic mechan
and in the special theori of rel we therefor differenti
between referencebodi k rel to which the recognis law of
natur can be said to hold and referencebodi k rel to which
these law do not hold
but no person whose mode of thought is logic can rest satisfi with
thi condit of thing he ask how doe it come that certain
referencebodi or their state of motion ar given prioriti over
other referencebodi or their state of motion what is the reason
for thi prefer in order to show clearli what i mean by thi
question i shall make us of a comparison
i am stand in front of a ga rang stand alongsid of each other
on the rang ar two pan so much alik that on mai be mistaken for
the other both ar half full of water i notic that steam is be
emit continu from the on pan but not from the other i am
surpris at thi even if i have never seen either a ga rang or a
pan befor but if i now notic a lumin someth of bluish colour
under the first pan but not under the other i ceas to be astonish
even if i have never befor seen a ga flame for i can onli sai that
thi bluish someth will caus the emiss of the steam or at least
possibl it mai do so if howev i notic the bluish someth in
neither case and if i observ that the on continu emit steam
whilst the other doe not then i shall remain astonish and
dissatisfi until i have discov some circumst to which i can
attribut the differ behaviour of the two pan
analog i seek in vain for a real someth in classic mechan
or in the special theori of rel to which i can attribut the
differ behaviour of bodi consid with respect to the refer
system k and k15 newton saw thi object and attempt to
invalid it but without success but e mach recognis it most
clearli of all and becaus of thi object he claim that mechan
must be place on a new basi it can onli be got rid of by mean of a
physic which is conform to the gener principl of rel
sinc the equat of such a theori hold for everi bodi of refer
whatev mai be it state of motion
15 the object is of import more especi when the state of
motion of the referencebodi is of such a natur that it doe not
requir ani extern agenc for it mainten eg in the case
when the referencebodi is rotat uniformli
xxii
a few infer from the gener principl of rel
the consider of section xx show that the gener principl of
rel put us in a posit to deriv properti of the
gravit field in a pure theoret manner let us suppos for
instanc that we know the spacetim cours for ani natur process
whatsoev as regard the manner in which it take place in the
galileian domain rel to a galileian bodi of refer k by
mean of pure theoret oper ie simpli by calcul
we ar then abl to find how thi known natur process appear as
seen from a referencebodi k which is acceler rel to k
but sinc a gravit field exist with respect to thi new bodi of
refer k our consider also teach us how the gravit
field influenc the process studi
for exampl we learn that a bodi which is in a state of uniform
rectilinear motion with respect to k in accord with the law of
galilei is execut an acceler and in gener curvilinear motion
with respect to the acceler referencebodi k chest thi
acceler or curvatur correspond to the influenc on the move
bodi of the gravit field prevail rel to k it is
known that a gravit field influenc the movement of bodi in
thi wai so that our consider suppli us with noth
essenti new
howev we obtain a new result of fundament import when we carri
out the analog consider for a rai of light with respect to the
galileian referencebodi k such a rai of light is transmit
rectilinearli with the veloc c it can easili be shown that the
path of the same rai of light is no longer a straight line when we
consid it with refer to the acceler chest referencebodi
k from thi we conclud that in gener rai of light ar
propag curvilinearli in gravit field in two respect thi
result is of great import
in the first place it can be compar with the realiti although a
detail examin of the question show that the curvatur of light
rai requir by the gener theori of rel is onli exceedingli
small for the gravit field at our dispos in practic it
estim magnitud for light rai pass the sun at graze incid
is nevertheless 17 second of arc thi ought to manifest itself in
the follow wai as seen from the earth certain fix star appear
to be in the neighbourhood of the sun and ar thu capabl of
observ dure a total eclips of the sun at such time these
star ought to appear to be displac outward from the sun by an
amount indic abov as compar with their appar posit in the
sky when the sun is situat at anoth part of the heaven the
examin of the correct or otherwis of thi deduct is a
problem of the greatest import the earli solut of which is to
be expect of astronomers16
16 by mean of the star photograph of two expedit equip by a
joint committe of the royal and royal astronom societi the
exist of the deflect of light demand by theori wa first
confirm dure the solar eclips of 29th mai 1919 cf appendix
iii
in the second place our result show that accord to the gener
theori of rel the law of the constanc of the veloc of light
in vacuo which constitut on of the two fundament assumpt in
the special theori of rel and to which we have alreadi
frequent refer cannot claim ani unlimit valid a curvatur
of rai of light can onli take place when the veloc of propag
of light vari with posit now we might think that as a consequ
of thi the special theori of rel and with it the whole theori
of rel would be laid in the dust but in realiti thi is not the
case we can onli conclud that the special theori of rel cannot
claim an unlimit domain of valid it result hold onli so long as
we ar abl to disregard the influenc of gravit field on the
phenomena eg of light
sinc it ha often been contend by oppon of the theori of
rel that the special theori of rel is overthrown by the
gener theori of rel it is perhap advis to make the fact
of the case clearer by mean of an appropri comparison befor the
develop of electrodynam the law of electrostat were look
upon as the law of electr at the present time we know that
electr field can be deriv correctli from electrostat
consider onli for the case which is never strictli realis in
which the electr mass ar quit at rest rel to each other
and to the coordin system should we be justifi in sai that
for thi reason electrostat is overthrown by the fieldequ of
maxwel in electrodynam not in the least electrostat is
contain in electrodynam as a limit case the law of the latter
lead directli to those of the former for the case in which the field
ar invari with regard to time no fairer destini could be allot
to ani physic theori than that it should of itself point out the wai
to the introduct of a more comprehens theori in which it live
on as a limit case
in the exampl of the transmiss of light just dealt with we have
seen that the gener theori of rel enabl us to deriv
theoret the influenc of a gravit field on the cours of
natur process the law of which ar alreadi known when a
gravit field is absent but the most attract problem to the
solut of which the gener theori of rel suppli the kei
concern the investig of the law satisfi by the gravit
field itself let us consid thi for a moment
we ar acquaint with spacetim domain which behav approxim
in a galileian fashion under suitabl choic of referencebodi
ie domain in which gravit field ar absent if we now
refer such a domain to a referencebodi k possess ani kind of
motion then rel to k there exist a gravit field which
is variabl with respect to space and time17 the charact of thi
field will of cours depend on the motion chosen for k accord to
the gener theori of rel the gener law of the gravit
field must be satisfi for all gravit field obtain in thi
wai even though by no mean all gravitationi field can be produc
in thi wai yet we mai entertain the hope that the gener law of
gravit will be deriv from such gravit field of a
special kind thi hope ha been realis in the most beauti manner
but between the clear vision of thi goal and it actual realis it
wa necessari to surmount a seriou difficulti and as thi li deep
at the root of thing i dare not withhold it from the reader we
requir to extend our idea of the spacetim continuum still farther
17 thi follow from a generalis of the discuss in section

behaviour of clock and measuringrod on a rotat bodi of refer
hitherto i have purpos refrain from speak about the physic
interpret of space and timedata in the case of the gener
theori of rel as a consequ i am guilti of a certain
slovenli of treatment which as we know from the special theori of
rel is far from be unimport and pardon it is now
high time that we remedi thi defect but i would mention at the
outset that thi matter lai no small claim on the patienc and on
the power of abstract of the reader
we start off again from quit special case which we have frequent
us befor let us consid a space time domain in which no
gravit field exist rel to a referencebodi k whose state
of motion ha been suitabl chosen k is then a galileian
referencebodi as regard the domain consid and the result of the
special theori of rel hold rel to k let us suppos the
same domain refer to a second bodi of refer k which is
rotat uniformli with respect to k in order to fix our idea we
shall imagin k to be in the form of a plane circular disc which
rotat uniformli in it own plane about it centr an observ who is
sit eccentr on the disc k is sensibl of a forc which
act outward in a radial direct and which would be interpret as
an effect of inertia centrifug forc by an observ who wa at rest
with respect to the origin referencebodi k but the observ on
the disc mai regard hi disc as a referencebodi which is at rest on
the basi of the gener principl of rel he is justifi in
do thi the forc act on himself and in fact on all other
bodi which ar at rest rel to the disc he regard as the effect
of a gravit field nevertheless the spacedistribut of thi
gravit field is of a kind that would not be possibl on newton
theori of gravitation18 but sinc the observ believ in the
gener theori of rel thi doe not disturb him he is quit in
the right when he believ that a gener law of gravit can be
formulateda law which not onli explain the motion of the star
correctli but also the field of forc experienc by himself
18 the field disappear at the centr of the disc and increas
proportion to the distanc from the centr as we proce outward
the observ perform experi on hi circular disc with clock and
measuringrod in do so it is hi intent to arriv at exact

hi observ what will be hi experi in thi enterpris
to start with he place on of two ident construct clock at
the centr of the circular disc and the other on the edg of the disc
so that thei ar at rest rel to it we now ask ourselv whether
both clock go at the same rate from the standpoint of the nonrot
galileian referencebodi k as judg from thi bodi the clock at
the centr of the disc ha no veloc wherea the clock at the edg
of the disc is in motion rel to k in consequ of the
rotat accord to a result obtain in section xii it follow
that the latter clock goe at a rate perman slower than that of
the clock at the centr of the circular disc ie as observ from
k it is obviou that the same effect would be note by an observ
whom we will imagin sit alongsid hi clock at the centr of the
circular disc thu on our circular disc or to make the case more
gener in everi gravit field a clock will go more quickli or
less quickli accord to the posit in which the clock is situat
at rest for thi reason it is not possibl to obtain a reason
definit of time with the aid of clock which ar arrang at rest
with respect to the bodi of refer a similar difficulti present
itself when we attempt to appli our earlier definit of simultan
in such a case but i do not wish to go ani farther into thi question
moreov at thi stage the definit of the space coordin also
present insurmount difficulti if the observ appli hi
standard measuringrod a rod which is short as compar with the
radiu of the disc tangenti to the edg of the disc then as
judg from the galileian system the length of thi rod will be less
than 1 sinc accord to section xii move bodi suffer a
shorten in the direct of the motion on the other hand the
measuringrod will not experi a shorten in length as judg
from k if it is appli to the disc in the direct of the radiu
if then the observ first measur the circumfer of the disc
with hi measuringrod and then the diamet of the disc on divid
the on by the other he will not obtain as quotient the familiar
number 314 but a larger number19 wherea of cours for
a disc which is at rest with respect to k thi oper would yield
exactli thi prove that the proposit of euclidean geometri
cannot hold exactli on the rotat disc nor in gener in a
gravit field at least if we attribut the length 1 to the rod
in all posit and in everi orient henc the idea of a straight
line also lose it mean we ar therefor not in a posit to
defin exactli the coordin x y z rel to the disc by mean
of the method us in discuss the special theori and as long as the
coordin and time of event have not been defin we cannot
assign an exact mean to the natur law in which these occur
19 throughout thi consider we have to us the galileian

euclidean and noneuclidean continuum
the surfac of a marbl tabl is spread out in front of me i can get
from ani on point on thi tabl to ani other point by pass
continu from on point to a neighbour on and repeat thi
process a larg number of time or in other word by go from
point to point without execut jump i am sure the reader will
appreci with suffici clear what i mean here by neighbour
and by jump if he is not too pedant we express thi properti of
the surfac by describ the latter as a continuum
let us now imagin that a larg number of littl rod of equal length
have been made their length be small compar with the dimens
of the marbl slab when i sai thei ar of equal length i mean that
on can be laid on ani other without the end overlap we next lai
four of these littl rod on the marbl slab so that thei constitut a
quadrilater figur a squar the diagon of which ar equal
long to ensur the equal of the diagon we make us of a littl
testingrod to thi squar we add similar on each of which ha on
rod in common with the first we proce in like manner with each of
these squar until final the whole marbl slab is laid out with
squar the arrang is such that each side of a squar belong to
two squar and each corner to four squar
it is a verit wonder that we can carri out thi busi without
get into the greatest difficulti we onli need to think of the
follow if at ani moment three squar meet at a corner then two
side of the fourth squar ar alreadi laid and as a consequ the
arrang of the remain two side of the squar is alreadi
complet determin but i am now no longer abl to adjust the
quadrilater so that it diagon mai be equal if thei ar equal of
their own accord then thi is an especi favour of the marbl slab
and of the littl rod about which i can onli be thankfulli surpris
we must experi mani such surpris if the construct is to be
success
if everyth ha realli gone smoothli then i sai that the point of
the marbl slab constitut a euclidean continuum with respect to the
littl rod which ha been us as a distanc lineinterv by
choos on corner of a squar as origin i can characteris everi
other corner of a squar with refer to thi origin by mean of two
number i onli need state how mani rod i must pass over when
start from the origin i proce toward the right and then
upward in order to arriv at the corner of the squar under
consider these two number ar then the cartesian coordin
of thi corner with refer to the cartesian coordin system
which is determin by the arrang of littl rod
by make us of the follow modif of thi abstract
experi we recognis that there must also be case in which the
experi would be unsuccess we shall suppos that the rod
expand by in amount proport to the increas of temperatur we
heat the central part of the marbl slab but not the peripheri in
which case two of our littl rod can still be brought into coincid
at everi posit on the tabl but our construct of squar must
necessarili come into disord dure the heat becaus the littl
rod on the central region of the tabl expand wherea those on the
outer part do not
with refer to our littl rodsdefin as unit lengthsth marbl
slab is no longer a euclidean continuum and we ar also no longer in
the posit of defin cartesian coordin directli with their
aid sinc the abov construct can no longer be carri out but
sinc there ar other thing which ar not influenc in a similar
manner to the littl rod or perhap not at all by the temperatur of
the tabl it is possibl quit natur to maintain the point of view
that the marbl slab is a euclidean continuum thi can be done in a
satisfactori manner by make a more subtl stipul about the
measur or the comparison of length
but if rod of everi kind ie of everi materi were to behav in
the same wai as regard the influenc of temperatur when thei ar on
the variabl heat marbl slab and if we had no other mean of
detect the effect of temperatur than the geometr behaviour of
our rod in experi analog to the on describ abov then our
best plan would be to assign the distanc on to two point on the
slab provid that the end of on of our rod could be made to
coincid with these two point for how els should we defin the
distanc without our proceed be in the highest measur grossli
arbitrari the method of cartesian coordin must then be discard
and replac by anoth which doe not assum the valid of euclidean
geometri for rigid bodies20 the reader will notic that the
situat depict here correspond to the on brought about by the
gener postul of rel section xxiii
20 mathematician have been confront with our problem in the
follow form if we ar given a surfac eg an ellipsoid in
euclidean threedimension space then there exist for thi surfac
a twodimension geometri just as much as for a plane surfac gauss
undertook the task of treat thi twodimension geometri from
first principl without make us of the fact that the surfac
belong to a euclidean continuum of three dimens if we imagin
construct to be made with rigid rod in the surfac similar to
that abov with the marbl slab we should find that differ law
hold for these from those result on the basi of euclidean plane
geometri the surfac is not a euclidean continuum with respect to the
rod and we cannot defin cartesian coordin in the surfac
gauss indic the principl accord to which we can treat the
geometr relationship in the surfac and thu point out the wai
to the method of riemann of treat multidimension noneuclidean
continuum thu it is that mathematician long ago solv the formal
problem to which we ar led by the gener postul of rel

gaussian coordin
image033
accord to gauss thi combin analyt and geometr mode of
handl the problem can be arriv at in the follow wai we imagin
a system of arbitrari curv see fig 4 drawn on the surfac of the
tabl these we design as ucurv and we indic each of them
by mean of a number the curv u 1 u 2 and u 3 ar drawn
in the diagram between the curv u 1 and u 2 we must imagin
an infinit larg number to be drawn all of which correspond to real
number ly between 1 and 2 we have then a system of ucurv and
thi infinit dens system cover the whole surfac of the tabl
these ucurv must not intersect each other and through each point
of the surfac on and onli on curv must pass thu a perfectli
definit valu of u belong to everi point on the surfac of the
marbl slab in like manner we imagin a system of vcurv drawn on
the surfac these satisfi the same condit as the ucurv thei
ar provid with number in a correspond manner and thei mai
likewis be of arbitrari shape it follow that a valu of u and a
valu of v belong to everi point on the surfac of the tabl we call
these two number the coordin of the surfac of the tabl
gaussian coordin for exampl the point p in the diagram ha
the gaussian coordin u 3 v 1 two neighbour point p
and p on the surfac then correspond to the coordin
p u v
p u du v dv
where du and dv signifi veri small number in a similar manner we
mai indic the distanc lineinterv between p and p as
measur with a littl rod by mean of the veri small number ds
then accord to gauss we have
ds2 g11du2 2g12du dv g22dv2
where g11 g12 g22 ar magnitud which depend in a perfectli
definit wai on u and v the magnitud g11 g12 and g22
determin the behaviour of the rod rel to the ucurv and
vcurv and thu also rel to the surfac of the tabl for the
case in which the point of the surfac consid form a euclidean
continuum with refer to the measuringrod but onli in thi case
it is possibl to draw the ucurv and vcurv and to attach
number to them in such a manner that we simpli have
ds2 du2 dv2
under these condit the ucurv and vcurv ar straight
line in the sens of euclidean geometri and thei ar perpendicular to
each other here the gaussian coordin ar simpli cartesian on it
is clear that gauss coordin ar noth more than an associ
of two set of number with the point of the surfac consid of
such a natur that numer valu differ veri slightli from each
other ar associ with neighbour point in space
so far these consider hold for a continuum of two dimens
but the gaussian method can be appli also to a continuum of three
four or more dimens if for instanc a continuum of four
dimens be suppos avail we mai repres it in the follow
wai with everi point of the continuum we associ arbitrarili four
number x1 x2 x3 x4 which ar known as coordin
adjac point correspond to adjac valu of the coordin if a
distanc ds is associ with the adjac point p and p thi
distanc be measur and well defin from a physic point of
view then the follow formula hold
ds2 g11dx12 2g12dx1dx2 g44dx42
where the magnitud g11 etc have valu which vari with the
posit in the continuum onli when the continuum is a euclidean on
is it possibl to associ the coordin x1 x4 with the
point of the continuum so that we have simpli
ds2 dx12 dx22 dx32 dx42
in thi case relat hold in the fourdimension continuum which ar
analog to those hold in our threedimension measur
howev the gauss treatment for ds2 which we have given abov is not
alwai possibl it is onli possibl when suffici small region of
the continuum under consider mai be regard as euclidean
continua for exampl thi obvious hold in the case of the marbl
slab of the tabl and local variat of temperatur the temperatur
is practic constant for a small part of the slab and thu the
geometr behaviour of the rod is almost as it ought to be
accord to the rule of euclidean geometri henc the imperfect
of the construct of squar in the previou section do not show
themselv clearli until thi construct is extend over a
consider portion of the surfac of the tabl
we can sum thi up as follow gauss invent a method for the
mathemat treatment of continua in gener in which
sizerel distanc between neighbour point ar defin
to everi point of a continuum ar assign as mani number gaussian
coordin as the continuum ha dimens thi is done in such a
wai that onli on mean can be attach to the assign and that
number gaussian coordin which differ by an indefinit small
amount ar assign to adjac point the gaussian coordin system
is a logic generalis of the cartesian coordin system it is
also applic to noneuclidean continua but onli when with respect
to the defin size or distanc small part of the continuum under
consider behav more nearli like a euclidean system the smaller
the part of the continuum under our notic
xxvi
the spacetim continuum of the special theori of rel consid
as a euclidean continuum
we ar now in a posit to formul more exactli the idea of
minkowski which wa onli vagu indic in section xvii in
accord with the special theori of rel certain coordin
system ar given prefer for the descript of the
fourdimension spacetim continuum we call these galileian
coordin system for these system the four coordin x y
z t which determin an event orin other wordsa point of the
fourdimension continuum ar defin physic in a simpl manner
as set forth in detail in the first part of thi book for the
transit from on galileian system to anoth which is move
uniformli with refer to the first the equat of the lorentz
transform ar valid these last form the basi for the deriv
of deduct from the special theori of rel and in themselv
thei ar noth more than the express of the univers valid of
the law of transmiss of light for all galileian system of
refer
minkowski found that the lorentz transform satisfi the follow
simpl condit let us consid two neighbour event the
rel posit of which in the fourdimension continuum is given
with respect to a galileian referencebodi k by the space coordin
differ dx dy dz and the timediffer dt with refer
to a second galileian system we shall suppos that the correspond
differ for these two event ar dx dy dz dt then these
magnitud alwai fulfil the condition21
21 cf appendix i and ii the relat which ar deriv there
for the coordin themselv ar valid also for coordin
differ and thu also for coordin differenti
indefinit small differ
dx2 dy2 dz2 c2dt2 dx2 dy2 dz2
c2dt2
the valid of the lorentz transform follow from thi condit
we can express thi as follow the magnitud
ds2 dx2 dy2 dz2 c2 dt2
which belong to two adjac point of the fourdimension spacetim
continuum ha the same valu for all select galileian
referencebodi if we replac x y z
image034
by x1 x2 x3 x4 we also obtain the result that
ds2 dx12 dx22 dx32 dx42
is independ of the choic of the bodi of refer we call the
magnitud ds the distanc apart of the two event or
fourdimension point
thu if we choos as timevari the imaginari variabl
image035
instead of the real quantiti t we can regard the spacetim
contintiumaccord with the special theori of relativitya a
euclidean fourdimension continuum a result which follow from the
consider of the preced section
xxvii
the spacetim continuum of the gener theori of rel is not a
euclidean continuum
in the first part of thi book we were abl to make us of spacetim
coordin which allow of a simpl and direct physic
interpret and which accord to section xxvi can be regard
as fourdimension cartesian coordin thi wa possibl on the
basi of the law of the constanc of the veloc of light but
accord to section xxi the gener theori of rel cannot retain
thi law on the contrari we arriv at the result that accord to
thi latter theori the veloc of light must alwai depend on the
coordin when a gravit field is present in connect with
a specif illustr in section xxiii we found that the presenc of
a gravit field invalid the definit of the coordin and
the time which led us to our object in the special theori of
rel
in view of the resuit of these consider we ar led to the
convict that accord to the gener principl of rel the
spacetim continuum cannot be regard as a euclidean on but that
here we have the gener case correspond to the marbl slab with
local variat of temperatur and with which we made acquaint as
an exampl of a twodimension continuum just as it wa there
imposs to construct a cartesian coordin system from equal rod
so here it is imposs to build up a system referencebodi from
rigid bodi and clock which shall be of such a natur that
measuringrod and clock arrang rigidli with respect to on
anoth shall indic posit and time directli such wa the
essenc of the difficulti with which we were confront in section
xxiii
but the consider of section xxv and xxvi show us the wai to
surmount thi difficulti we refer the fourdimension spacetim
continuum in an arbitrari manner to gauss coordin we assign to
everi point of the continuum event four number x1 x2 x3
x4 coordin which have not the least direct physic
signific but onli serv the purpos of number the point of the
continuum in a definit but arbitrari manner thi arrang doe not
even need to be of such a kind that we must regard x1 x2 x3 as
space coordin and x4 as a time coordin
the reader mai think that such a descript of the world would be
quit inadequ what doe it mean to assign to an event the
particular coordin x1 x2 x3 x4 if in themselv these
coordin have no signific more care consider show
howev that thi anxieti is unfound let us consid for instanc
a materi point with ani kind of motion if thi point had onli a
momentari exist without durat then it would to describ in
spacetim by a singl system of valu x1 x2 x3 x4 thu
it perman exist must be characteris by an infinit larg
number of such system of valu the coordin valu of which ar
so close togeth as to give continu correspond to the materi
point we thu have a unidimension line in the fourdimension
continuum in the same wai ani such line in our continuum correspond
to mani point in motion the onli statement have regard to these
point which can claim a physic exist ar in realiti the
statement about their encount in our mathemat treatment such
an encount is express in the fact that the two line which
repres the motion of the point in question have a particular
system of coordin valu x1 x2 x3 x4 in common after
matur consider the reader will doubtless admit that in realiti
such encount constitut the onli actual evid of a timespac
natur with which we meet in physic statement
when we were describ the motion of a materi point rel to a
bodi of refer we state noth more than the encount of thi
point with particular point of the referencebodi we can also
determin the correspond valu of the time by the observ of
encount of the bodi with clock in conjunct with the observ
of the encount of the hand of clock with particular point on the
dial it is just the same in the case of spacemeasur by mean
of measuringrod as a littl consider will show
the follow statement hold gener everi physic descript
resolv itself into a number of statement each of which refer to
the spacetim coincid of two event a and b in term of
gaussian coordin everi such statement is express by the
agreement of their four coordin x1 x2 x3 x4 thu in
realiti the descript of the timespac continuum by mean of gauss
coordin complet replac the descript with the aid of a bodi
of refer without suffer from the defect of the latter mode of
descript it is not ti down to the euclidean charact of the
continuum which ha to be repres
xxviii
exact formul of the gener principl of rel
we ar now in a posit to replac the provision formul of the
gener principl of rel given in section xviii by an exact
formul the form there us all bodi of refer k k
etc ar equival for the descript of natur phenomena
formul of the gener law of natur whatev mai be their
state of motion cannot be maintain becaus the us of rigid
referencebodi in the sens of the method follow in the special
theori of rel is in gener not possibl in spacetim
descript the gauss coordin system ha to take the place of the
bodi of refer the follow statement correspond to the
fundament idea of the gener principl of rel all gaussian
coordin system ar essenti equival for the formul of
the gener law of natur
we can state thi gener principl of rel in still anoth
form which render it yet more clearli intellig than it is when in
the form of the natur extens of the special principl of
rel accord to the special theori of rel the
equat which express the gener law of natur pass over into
equat of the same form when by make us of the lorentz
transform we replac the spacetim variabl x y z t of a
galileian referencebodi k by the spacetim variabl x y z
t of a new referencebodi k accord to the gener theori of
rel on the other hand by applic of arbitrari
substitut of the gauss variabl x1 x2 x3 x4 the
equat must pass over into equat of the same form for everi
transform not onli the lorentz transform correspond to the
transit of on gauss coordin system into anoth
if we desir to adher to our oldtim threedimension view of
thing then we can characteris the develop which is be
undergon by the fundament idea of the gener theori of rel
as follow the special theori of rel ha refer to galileian
domain ie to those in which no gravit field exist in
thi connect a galileian referencebodi serv as bodi of refer
ie a rigid bodi the state of motion of which is so chosen that the
galileian law of the uniform rectilinear motion of isol materi
point hold rel to it
certain consider suggest that we should refer the same galileian
domain to nongalileian referencebodi also a gravit field
of a special kind is then present with respect to these bodi cf
section xx and xxiii
in gravit field there ar no such thing as rigid bodi with
euclidean properti thu the fictiti rigid bodi of refer is of
no avail in the gener theori of rel the motion of clock is
also influenc by gravit field and in such a wai that a
physic definit of time which is made directli with the aid of
clock ha by no mean the same degre of plausibl as in the
special theori of rel
for thi reason nonrigid referencebodi ar us which ar as a
whole not onli move in ani wai whatsoev but which also suffer
alter in form ad lib dure their motion clock for which
the law of motion is of ani kind howev irregular serv for the
definit of time we have to imagin each of these clock fix at a
point on the nonrigid referencebodi these clock satisfi onli the
on condit that the read which ar observ simultan on
adjac clock in space differ from each other by an indefinit
small amount thi nonrigid referencebodi which might appropri
be term a referencemollusc is in the main equival to a
gaussian fourdimension coordin system chosen arbitrarili that
which give the mollusc a certain comprehens as compar with
the gauss coordin system is the realli unjustifi formal
retent of the separ exist of the
space coordin as oppos to the time coordin everi point on
the mollusc is treat as a spacepoint and everi materi point which
is at rest rel to it as at rest so long as the mollusc is
consid as referencebodi the gener principl of rel
requir that all these mollusc can be us as referencebodi with
equal right and equal success in the formul of the gener law of
natur the law themselv must be quit independ of the choic of
mollusc
the great power possess by the gener principl of rel li
in the comprehens limit which is impos on the law of natur
in consequ of what we have seen abov
xxix
the solut of the problem of gravit on the basi of the gener
principl of rel
if the reader ha follow all our previou consider he will
have no further difficulti in understand the method lead to the
solut of the problem of gravit
we start off on a consider of a galileian domain ie a domain
in which there is no gravit field rel to the galileian
referencebodi k the behaviour of measuringrod and clock with
refer to k is known from the special theori of rel
likewis the behaviour of isol materi point the latter move
uniformli and in straight line
now let us refer thi domain to a random gauss coordin system or to
a mollusc as referencebodi k then with respect to k there is
a gravit field g of a particular kind we learn the
behaviour of measuringrod and clock and also of freelymov
materi point with refer to k simpli by mathemat
transform we interpret thi behaviour as the behaviour of
measuringrod clock and materi point under the influenc of the
gravit field g hereupon we introduc a hypothesi that the
influenc of the gravit field on measuringrod clock and
freelymov materi point continu to take place accord to the
same law even in the case where the prevail gravit field is
not deriv from the galileian special case simpli by mean of a
transform of coordin
the next step is to investig the spacetim behaviour of the
gravit field g which wa deriv from the galileian special
case simpli by transform of the coordin thi behaviour is
formul in a law which is alwai valid no matter how the
referencebodi mollusc us in the descript mai be chosen
thi law is not yet the gener law of the gravit field sinc
the gravit field under consider is of a special kind in
order to find out the gener lawoffield of gravit we still
requir to obtain a generalis of the law as found abov thi can
be obtain without capric howev by take into consider the
follow demand
a the requir generalis must likewis satisfi the gener
postul of rel
b if there is ani matter in the domain under consider onli
it inerti mass and thu accord to section xv onli it energi is
of import for it effect in excit a field
c gravit field and matter togeth must satisfi the law of
the conserv of energi and of impuls
final the gener principl of rel permit us to determin
the influenc of the gravit field on the cours of all those
process which take place accord to known law when a gravit
field is absent ie which have alreadi been fit into the frame of
the special theori of rel in thi connect we proce in
principl accord to the method which ha alreadi been explain for
measuringrod clock and freeli move materi point
the theori of gravit deriv in thi wai from the gener
postul of rel excel not onli in it beauti nor in remov
the defect attach to classic mechan which wa brought to light
in section xxi nor in interpret the empir law of the equal
of inerti and gravit mass but it ha also alreadi explain a
result of observ in astronomi against which classic mechan
is powerless
if we confin the applic of the theori to the case where the
gravit field can be regard as be weak and in which all
mass move with respect to the coordin system with veloc which
ar small compar with the veloc of light we then obtain as a
first approxim the newtonian theori thu the latter theori is
obtain here without ani particular assumpt wherea newton had to
introduc the hypothesi that the forc of attract between mutual
attract materi point is invers proport to the squar of
the distanc between them if we increas the accuraci of the
calcul deviat from the theori of newton make their
appear practic all of which must nevertheless escap the test
of observ ow to their small
we must draw attent here to on of these deviat accord to
newton theori a planet move round the sun in an ellips which
would perman maintain it posit with respect to the fix
star if we could disregard the motion of the fix star themselv
and the action of the other planet under consider thu if we
correct the observ motion of the planet for these two influenc
and if newton theori be strictli correct we ought to obtain for the
orbit of the planet an ellips which is fix with refer to the
fix star thi deduct which can be test with great accuraci
ha been confirm for all the planet save on with the precis
that is capabl of be obtain by the delicaci of observ
attain at the present time the sole except is mercuri the
planet which li nearest the sun sinc the time of leverri it ha
been known that the ellips correspond to the orbit of mercuri
after it ha been correct for the influenc mention abov is not
stationari with respect to the fix star but that it rotat
exceedingli slowli in the plane of the orbit and in the sens of the
orbit motion the valu obtain for thi rotari movement of the
orbit ellips wa 43 second of arc per centuri an amount ensur to
be correct to within a few second of arc thi effect can be explain
by mean of classic mechan onli on the assumpt of hypothes
which have littl probabl and which were devis sole for thi
purpons
on the basi of the gener theori of rel it is found that the
ellips of everi planet round the sun must necessarili rotat in the
manner indic abov that for all the planet with the except of
mercuri thi rotat is too small to be detect with the delicaci of
observ possibl at the present time but that in the case of
mercuri it must amount to 43 second of arc per centuri a result which
is strictli in agreement with observ
apart from thi on it ha hitherto been possibl to make onli two
deduct from the theori which admit of be test by observ
to wit the curvatur of light rai by the gravit field of the
sun22 and a displac of the spectral line of light reach us
from larg star as compar with the correspond line for light
produc in an analog manner terrestri ie by the same kind
of atom23 these two deduct from the theori have both been

cosmolog difficulti of newton theori
part from the difficulti discuss in section xxi there is a second
fundament difficulti attend classic celesti mechan which
to the best of my knowledg wa first discuss in detail by the
astronom seelig if we ponder over the question as to how the
univers consid as a whole is to be regard the first answer
that suggest itself to us is sure thi as regard space and time
the univers is infinit there ar star everywher so that the
densiti of matter although veri variabl in detail is nevertheless on
the averag everywher the same in other word howev far we might
travel through space we should find everywher an attenu swarm of
fix star of approrim the same kind and densiti
thi view is not in harmoni with the theori of newton the latter
theori rather requir that the univers should have a kind of centr
in which the densiti of the star is a maximum and that as we proce
outward from thi centr the groupdens of the star should
diminish until final at great distanc it is succeed by an
infinit region of empti the stellar univers ought to be a finit
island in the infinit ocean of space24
24 proofaccord to the theori of newton the number of line
of forc which come from infin and termin in a mass m is
proport to the mass m if on the averag the mass densiti 0
is constant throughout the univers then a sphere of volum v will
enclos the averag mass 0v thu the number of line of forc
pass through the surfac f of the sphere into it interior is
proport to 0v for unit area of the surfac of the sphere the
number of line of forc which enter the sphere is thu proport
to 0vf or to 0r henc the intens of the field at the
surfac would ultim becom infinit with increas radiu r of
the sphere which is imposs
thi concept is in itself not veri satisfactori it is still less
satisfactori becaus it lead to the result that the light emit by
the star and also individu star of the stellar system ar
perpetu pass out into infinit space never to return and
without ever again come into interact with other object of
natur such a finit materi univers would be destin to becom
gradual but systemat impoverish
in order to escap thi dilemma seelig suggest a modif of
newton law in which he assum that for great distanc the forc of
attract between two mass diminish more rapidli than would result
from the invers squar law in thi wai it is possibl for the mean
densiti of matter to be constant everywher even to infin without
infinit larg gravit field be produc we thu free
ourselv from the distast concept that the materi univers
ought to possess someth of the natur of a centr of cours we
purchas our emancip from the fundament difficulti mention
at the cost of a modif and complic of newton law which
ha neither empir nor theoret foundat we can imagin
innumer law which would serv the same purpos without our be
abl to state a reason why on of them is to be prefer to the
other for ani on of these law would be found just as littl on
more gener theoret principl as is the law of newton

the possibl of a finit and yet unbound univers
but specul on the structur of the univers also move in quit
anoth direct the develop of noneuclidean geometri led to the
recognit of the fact that we can cast doubt on the infinit
of our space without come into conflict with the law of thought or
with experi riemann helmholtz these question have alreadi been
treat in detail and with unsurpass lucid by helmholtz and
poincar wherea i can onli touch on them briefli here
in the first place we imagin an exist in two dimension space
flat be with flat implement and in particular flat rigid
measuringrod ar free to move in a plane for them noth exist
outsid of thi plane that which thei observ to happen to themselv
and to their flat thing is the allinclus realiti of their plane
in particular the construct of plane euclidean geometri can be
carri out by mean of the rod eg the lattic construct
consid in section xxiv in contrast to our the univers of these
be is twodimension but like our it extend to infin in
their univers there is room for an infinit number of ident
squar made up of rod ie it volum surfac is infinit if
these be sai their univers is plane there is sens in the
statement becaus thei mean that thei can perform the construct of
plane euclidean geometri with their rod in thi connect the
individu rod alwai repres the same distanc independ of
their posit
let us consid now a second twodimension exist but thi time
on a spheric surfac instead of on a plane the flat be with
their measuringrod and other object fit exactli on thi surfac and
thei ar unabl to leav it their whole univers of observ
extend exclus over the surfac of the sphere ar these be
abl to regard the geometri of their univers as be plane geometri
and their rod withal as the realis of distanc thei cannot do
thi for if thei attempt to realis a straight line thei will obtain
a curv which we threedimension be design as a great
circl ie a selfcontain line of definit finit length which
can be measur up by mean of a measuringrod similarli thi
univers ha a finit area that can be compar with the area of a
squar construct with rod the great charm result from thi
consider li in the recognit of the fact that the univers of
these be is finit and yet ha no limit
but the sphericalsurfac be do not need to go on a worldtour in
order to perceiv that thei ar not live in a euclidean univers
thei can convinc themselv of thi on everi part of their world
provid thei do not us too small a piec of it start from a
point thei draw straight line arc of circl as judg in three
dimension space of equal length in all direct thei will call
the line join the free end of these line a circl for a plane
surfac the ratio of the circumfer of a circl to it diamet
both length be measur with the same rod is accord to
euclidean geometri of the plane equal to a constant valu which is
independ of the diamet of the circl on their spheric surfac
our flat be would find for thi ratio the valu
image036
ie a smaller valu than the differ be the more
consider the greater is the radiu of the circl in comparison
with the radiu r of the worldspher by mean of thi relat
the spheric be can determin the radiu of their univers
world even when onli a rel small part of their worldspher
is avail for their measur but if thi part is veri small
inde thei will no longer be abl to demonstr that thei ar on a
spheric world and not on a euclidean plane for a small part of a
spheric surfac differ onli slightli from a piec of a plane of the
same size
thu if the spheric surfac be ar live on a planet of which
the solar system occupi onli a neglig small part of the spheric
univers thei have no mean of determin whether thei ar live in
a finit or in an infinit univers becaus the piec of univers to
which thei have access is in both case practic plane or
euclidean it follow directli from thi discuss that for our
sphereb the circumfer of a circl first increas with the
radiu until the circumfer of the univers is reach and that
it thenceforward gradual decreas to zero for still further
increas valu of the radiu dure thi process the area of the
circl continu to increas more and more until final it becom
equal to the total area of the whole worldspher
perhap the reader will wonder why we have place our be on a
sphere rather than on anoth close surfac but thi choic ha it
justif in the fact that of all close surfac the sphere is
uniqu in possess the properti that all point on it ar equival
i admit that the ratio of the circumfer c of a circl to it
radiu r depend on r but for a given valu of r it is the same
for all point of the worldspher in other word the worldspher
is a surfac of constant curvatur
to thi twodimension sphereunivers there is a threedimension
analog name the threedimension spheric space which wa
discov by riemann it point ar likewis all equival it
possess a finit volum which is determin by it radiu
22r3 is it possibl to imagin a spheric space to imagin a
space mean noth els than that we imagin an epitom of our space
experi ie of experi that we can have in the movement of
rigid bodi in thi sens we can imagin a spheric space
suppos we draw line or stretch string in all direct from a
point and mark off from each of these the distanc r with a
measuringrod all the free endpoint of these length lie on a
spheric surfac we can special measur up the area f of thi
surfac by mean of a squar made up of measuringrod if the univers
is euclidean then f 4r2 if it is spheric then f is alwai
less than 4r2 with increas valu of r f increas from zero
up to a maximum valu which is determin by the worldradiu but
for still further increas valu of r the area gradual
diminish to zero at first the straight line which radiat from the
start point diverg farther and farther from on anoth but later
thei approach each other and final thei run togeth again at a
counterpoint to the start point under such condit thei have
travers the whole spheric space it is easili seen that the
threedimension spheric space is quit analog to the
twodimension spheric surfac it is finit ie of finit
volum and ha no bound
it mai be mention that there is yet anoth kind of curv space
ellipt space it can be regard as a curv space in which the
two counterpoint ar ident indistinguish from each other
an ellipt univers can thu be consid to some extent as a
curv univers possess central symmetri
it follow from what ha been said that close space without limit
ar conceiv from amongst these the spheric space and the
ellipt excel in it simplic sinc all point on it ar
equival as a result of thi discuss a most interest question
aris for astronom and physicist and that is whether the univers
in which we live is infinit or whether it is finit in the manner of
the spheric univers our experi is far from be suffici to
enabl us to answer thi question but the gener theori of rel
permit of our answer it with a moder degre of certainti and in
thi connect the difficulti mention in section xxx find it
solut
xxxii
the structur of space accord to the gener theori of rel
accord to the gener theori of rel the geometr
properti of space ar not independ but thei ar determin by
matter thu we can draw conclus about the geometr structur of
the univers onli if we base our consider on the state of the
matter as be someth that is known we know from experi that
for a suitabl chosen coordin system the veloc of the star
ar small as compar with the veloc of transmiss of light we
can thu as a rough approxim arriv at a conclus as to the
natur of the univers as a whole if we treat the matter as be at
rest
we alreadi know from our previou discuss that the behaviour of
measuringrod and clock is influenc by gravit field ie
by the distribut of matter thi in itself is suffici to exclud
the possibl of the exact valid of euclidean geometri in our
univers but it is conceiv that our univers differ onli slightli
from a euclidean on and thi notion seem all the more probabl
sinc calcul show that the metric of surround space is
influenc onli to an exceedingli small extent by mass even of the
magnitud of our sun we might imagin that as regard geometri our
univers behav analog to a surfac which is irregularli curv
in it individu part but which nowher depart appreci from a
plane someth like the rippl surfac of a lake such a univers
might fittingli be call a quasieuclidean univers as regard it
space it would be infinit but calcul show that in a
quasieuclidean univers the averag densiti of matter would
necessarili be nil thu such a univers could not be inhabit by
matter everywher it would present to us that unsatisfactori pictur
which we portrai in section xxx
if we ar to have in the univers an averag densiti of matter which
differ from zero howev small mai be that differ then the
univers cannot be quasieuclidean on the contrari the result of
calcul indic that if matter be distribut uniformli the
univers would necessarili be spheric or ellipt sinc in
realiti the detail distribut of matter is not uniform the real
univers will deviat in individu part from the spheric ie
the univers will be quasispher but it will be necessarili
finit in fact the theori suppli us with a simpl connection25
between the spaceexpans of the univers and the averag densiti of
matter in it
25 for the radiu r of the univers we obtain the equat

we obtain the equat

we should thu have the solut of our problem if the constant a

for the origin of k we have perman x 0 and henc
accord to the first of the equat 5
image041
if we call v the veloc with which the origin of k is move
rel to k we then have
image042
the same valu v can be obtain from equat 5 if we calcul
the veloc of anoth point of k rel to k or the veloc
direct toward the neg xaxi of a point of k with respect
to k in short we can design v as the rel veloc of the
two system
furthermor the principl of rel teach us that as judg
from k the length of a unit measuringrod which is at rest with
refer to k must be exactli the same as the length as judg
from k of a unit measuringrod which is at rest rel to k in
order to see how the point of the xaxi appear as view from k
we onli requir to take a snapshot of k from k thi mean that
we have to insert a particular valu of t time of k eg t

from thi we conclud that two point on the xaxi separ by the

in thi wai we satisfi the postul of the constanc of the veloc

the system k and for the system k thi mai be shown in the
follow manner
we suppos a lightsign sent out from the origin of k at the time

or if we squar thi equat accord to the equat
x2 y2 z2 c2t2 0 10
it is requir by the law of propag of light in conjunct with
the postul of rel that the transmiss of the signal in

or
x2 y2 z2 c2t2 0 10a
in order that equat 10a mai be a consequ of equat 10
we must have

sinc equat 8a must hold for point on the xaxi we thu

not essenti that the veloc of translat of k with respect to

show that we ar abl to construct the lorentz transform in thi

transform in the special sens and from pure spatial
transform which correspond to the replac of the
rectangular coordin system by a new system with it ax point
in other direct

that is by the aforement choic of coordin 11a see
the end of appendix ii is transform into thi equat
we see from 12 that the imaginari time coordin x4 enter into
the condit of transform in exactli the same wai as the space
coordin x1 x2 x3 it is due to thi fact that accord
to the theori of rel the time x4 enter into natur law
in the same form as the space co ordin x1 x2 x3
a fourdimension continuum describ by the coordin x1
x2 x3 x4 wa call world by minkowski who also term a

thi fourdimension world bear a close similar to the
threedimension space of euclidean analyt geometri if we
introduc into the latter a new cartesian coordin system x1
x2 x3 with the same origin then x1 x2 x3 ar
linear homogen function of x1 x2 x3 which ident
satisfi the equat
x12 x22 x32 x12 x22 x32
the analog with 12 is a complet on we can regard minkowski
world in a formal manner as a fourdimension euclidean space with
an imaginari time coordin the lorentz transform correspond
to a rotat of the coordin system in the fourdimension

the experiment confirm of the gener theori of rel

interest is avail in the provinc of biologi in the darwinian
theori of the develop of speci by select in the struggl for

we have anoth instanc of farreach agreement between the

so far that up to the present we have been abl to find onli a few
deduct from the gener theori of rel which ar capabl of
investig and to which the physic of prerel dai doe not
also lead and thi despit the profound differ in the fundament
assumpt of the two theori in what follow we shall again
consid these import deduct and we shall also discuss the
empir evid appertain to them which ha hitherto been
obtain
a motion of the perihelion of mercuri
accord to newtonian mechan and newton law of gravit a
planet which is revolv round the sun would describ an ellips round
the latter or more correctli round the common centr of graviti of
the sun and the planet in such a system the sun or the common centr
of graviti li in on of the foci of the orbit ellips in such a
manner that in the cours of a planetyear the distanc sunplanet
grow from a minimum to a maximum and then decreas again to a
minimum if instead of newton law we insert a somewhat differ law
of attract into the calcul we find that accord to thi new
law the motion would still take place in such a manner that the
distanc sunplanet exhibit period variat but in thi case the
angl describ by the line join sun and planet dure such a period
from perihelionclosest proxim to the sunto perihelion would
differ from 360 the line of the orbit would not then be a close on
but in the cours of time it would fill up an annular part of the
orbit plane viz between the circl of least and the circl of
greatest distanc of the planet from the sun
accord also to the gener theori of rel which differ of
cours from the theori of newton a small variat from the
newtonkepl motion of a planet in it orbit should take place and in
such awai that the angl describ by the radiu sunplanet between
on perhelion and the next should exce that correspond to on

dure the interv between on perihelion and the next in thi
express a repres the major semiaxi of the ellips e it
eccentr c the veloc of light and t the period of
revolut of the planet our result mai also be state as follow
accord to the gener theori of rel the major axi of the
ellips rotat round the sun in the same sens as the orbit motion
of the planet theori requir that thi rotat should amount to 43
second of arc per centuri for the planet mercuri but for the other
planet of our solar system it magnitud should be so small that it
would necessarili escap detection26
26 especi sinc the next planet venu ha an orbit that is
almost an exact circl which make it more difficult to locat the
perihelion with precis
in point of fact astronom have found that the theori of newton doe
not suffic to calcul the observ motion of mercuri with an
exact correspond to that of the delicaci of observ
attain at the present time after take account of all the
disturb influenc exert on mercuri by the remain planet it
wa found leverri 1859 and newcomb 1895 that an unexplain
periheli movement of the orbit of mercuri remain over the amount
of which doe not differ sensibl from the abov mention 43 second
of arc per centuri the uncertainti of the empir result amount to
a few second onli
b deflect of light by a gravit field
image052
in section xxii it ha been alreadi mention that accord to the
gener theori of rel a rai of light will experi a
curvatur of it path when pass through a gravit field thi
curvatur be similar to that experienc by the path of a bodi which
is project through a gravit field as a result of thi theori
we should expect that a rai of light which is pass close to a
heavenli bodi would be deviat toward the latter for a rai of light
which pass the sun at a distanc of sunradii from it centr the
angl of deflect should amount to
image053
it mai be ad that accord to the theori half of thi deflect
is produc by the newtonian field of attract of the sun and the
other half by the geometr modif curvatur of space
caus by the sun
thi result admit of an experiment test by mean of the photograph
registr of star dure a total eclips of the sun the onli
reason why we must wait for a total eclips is becaus at everi other
time the atmospher is so strongli illumin by the light from the
sun that the star situat near the sun disc ar invis the
predict effect can be seen clearli from the accompani diagram if
the sun s were not present a star which is practic infinit
distant would be seen in the direct d1 as observ front the
earth but as a consequ of the deflect of light from the star by
the sun the star will be seen in the direct d2 ie at a
somewhat greater distanc from the centr of the sun than correspond
to it real posit
in practic the question is test in the follow wai the star in
the neighbourhood of the sun ar photograph dure a solar eclips
in addit a second photograph of the same star is taken when the
sun is situat at anoth posit in the sky ie a few month
earlier or later as compar with the standard photograph the
posit of the star on the eclipsephotograph ought to appear
displac radial outward awai from the centr of the sun by an

c displac of spectral line toward the red
in section xxiii it ha been shown that in a system k which is in
rotat with regard to a galileian system k clock of ident
construct and which ar consid at rest with respect to the
rotat referencebodi go at rate which ar depend on the
posit of the clock we shall now examin thi depend
quantit a clock which is situat at a distanc r from the
centr of the disc ha a veloc rel to k which is given by
v r
where repres the angular veloc of rotat of the disc k
with respect to k if v0 repres the number of tick of the
clock per unit time rate of the clock rel to k when the
clock is at rest then the rate of the clock v when it is move
rel to k with a veloc v but at rest with respect to the
disc will in accord with section xii be given by
image055
or with suffici accuraci by
image056
thi express mai also be state in the follow form
image057
if we repres the differ of potenti of the centrifug forc
between the posit of the clock and the centr of the disc by
ie the work consid neg which must be perform on the
unit of mass against the centrifug forc in order to transport it
from the posit of the clock on the rotat disc to the centr of
the disc then we have
image058
from thi it follow that
image059
in the first place we see from thi express that two clock of
ident construct will go at differ rate when situat at
differ distanc from the centr of the disc thi result is also
valid from the standpoint of an observ who is rotat with the disc
now as judg from the disc the latter is in a gravit field of
potenti henc the result we have obtain will hold quit
gener for gravit field furthermor we can regard an atom
which is emit spectral line as a clock so that the follow
statement will hold
an atom absorb or emit light of a frequenc which is depend on
the potenti of the gravit field in which it is situat
the frequenc of an atom situat on the surfac of a heavenli bodi
will be somewhat less than the frequenc of an atom of the same element
which is situat in free space or on the surfac of a smaller
celesti bodi
now k mr where k is newton constant of gravit and
m is the mass of the heavenli bodi thu a displac toward the
red ought to take place for spectral line produc at the surfac of
star as compar with the spectral line of the same element produc
at the surfac of the earth the amount of thi displac be
image060
for the sun the displac toward the red predict by theori
amount to about two millionth of the wavelength a trustworthi
calcul is not possibl in the case of the star becaus in
gener neither the mass m nor the radiu r ar known
it is an open question whether or not thi effect exist and at the
present time 1920 astronom ar work with great zeal toward the
solut ow to the small of the effect in the case of the sun
it is difficult to form an opinion as to it exist wherea grebe
and bachem bonn as a result of their own measur and those of
eversh and schwarzschild on the cyanogen band have place the
exist of the effect almost beyond doubt while other investig
particularli st john have been led to the opposit opinion in
consequ of their measur
mean displac of line toward the less refrang end of the
spectrum ar certainli reveal by statist investig of the
fix star but up to the present the examin of the avail
data doe not allow of ani definit decis be arriv at as to
whether or not these displac ar to be refer in realiti to the
effect of gravit the result of observ have been collect

which ha been engag our attent here in a paper by e freundlich

at all event a definit decis will be reach dure the next few
year if the displac of spectral line toward the red by the
gravit potenti doe not exist then the gener theori of
rel will be unten on the other hand if the caus of the
displac of spectral line be definit trace to the
gravit potenti then the studi of thi displac will
furnish us with import inform as to the mass of the heavenli
bodies27

spectrum wa definit establish by adam in 1924 by observ
on the dens companion of siriu for which the effect is about thirti
time greater than for the sun rwltranslat
appendix iv
the structur of space accord to the gener theori of rel
supplementari to section xxxii
sinc the public of the first edit of thi littl book our
knowledg about the structur of space in the larg cosmolog
problem ha had an import develop which ought to be mention
even in a popular present of the subject
my origin consider on the subject were base on two hypothes
1 there exist an averag densiti of matter in the whole of space
which is everywher the same and differ from zero
2 the magnitud radiu of space is independ of time
both these hypothes prove to be consist accord to the gener
theori of rel but onli after a hypothet term wa ad to
the field equat a term which wa not requir by the theori as
such nor did it seem natur from a theoret point of view
cosmolog term of the field equat
hypothesi 2 appear unavoid to me at the time sinc i thought
that on would get into bottomless specul if on depart from
it
howev alreadi in the twenti the russian mathematician friedman
show that a differ hypothesi wa natur from a pure
theoret point of view he realiz that it wa possibl to preserv
hypothesi 1 without introduc the less natur cosmolog term
into the field equat of gravit if on wa readi to drop
hypothesi 2 name the origin field equat admit a solut
in which the world radiu depend on time expand space in that
sens on can sai accord to friedman that the theori demand an
expans of space
a few year later hubbl show by a special investig of the
extragalact nebula milki wai that the spectral line emit
show a red shift which increas regularli with the distanc of the
nebula thi can be interpret in regard to our present knowledg
onli in the sens of doppler principl as an expans motion of the
system of star in the largea requir accord to friedman by the
field equat of gravit hubbl discoveri can therefor be
consid to some extent as a confirm of the theori
there doe aris howev a strang difficulti the interpret of
the galact lineshift discov by hubbl as an expans which can
hardli be doubt from a theoret point of view lead to an origin
of thi expans which li onli about 109 year ago while physic
astronomi make it appear like that the develop of individu
star and system of star take consider longer it is in no wai
known how thi incongru is to be overcom
i further want to remark that the theori of expand space togeth
with the empir data of astronomi permit no decis to be reach
about the finit or infinit charact of threedimension space
while the origin static hypothesi of space yield the closur
finit of space
