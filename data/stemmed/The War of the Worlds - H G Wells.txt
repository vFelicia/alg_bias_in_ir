the ev of the war
no on would have believ in the last year of the nineteenth centuri
that thi world wa be watch keenli and close by intellig
greater than man and yet as mortal as hi own that as men busi
themselv about their variou concern thei were scrutinis and
studi perhap almost as narrowli as a man with a microscop might
scrutinis the transient creatur that swarm and multipli in a drop of
water with infinit complac men went to and fro over thi globe
about their littl affair seren in their assur of their empir
over matter it is possibl that the infusoria under the microscop do
the same no on gave a thought to the older world of space as sourc
of human danger or thought of them onli to dismiss the idea of life
upon them as imposs or improb it is curiou to recal some of
the mental habit of those depart dai at most terrestri men
fanci there might be other men upon mar perhap inferior to
themselv and readi to welcom a missionari enterpris yet across the
gulf of space mind that ar to our mind as our ar to those of the
beast that perish intellect vast and cool and unsympathet
regard thi earth with enviou ey and slowli and sure drew their
plan against us and earli in the twentieth centuri came the great
disillusion
the planet mar i scarc need remind the reader revolv about the
sun at a mean distanc of 140000000 mile and the light and heat it
receiv from the sun is bare half of that receiv by thi world it
must be if the nebular hypothesi ha ani truth older than our world
and long befor thi earth ceas to be molten life upon it surfac
must have begun it cours the fact that it is scarc on seventh of
the volum of the earth must have acceler it cool to the
temperatur at which life could begin it ha air and water and all
that is necessari for the support of anim exist
yet so vain is man and so blind by hi vaniti that no writer up to
the veri end of the nineteenth centuri express ani idea that
intellig life might have develop there far or inde at all
beyond it earthli level nor wa it gener understood that sinc
mar is older than our earth with scarc a quarter of the
superfici area and remot from the sun it necessarili follow that
it is not onli more distant from time begin but nearer it end
the secular cool that must somedai overtak our planet ha alreadi
gone far inde with our neighbour it physic condit is still
larg a mysteri but we know now that even in it equatori region
the middai temperatur bare approach that of our coldest winter
it air is much more attenu than our it ocean have shrunk until
thei cover but a third of it surfac and as it slow season chang
huge snowcap gather and melt about either pole and period
inund it temper zone that last stage of exhaust which to
us is still incred remot ha becom a presentdai problem for the
inhabit of mar the immedi pressur of necess ha brighten
their intellect enlarg their power and harden their heart and
look across space with instrument and intellig such as we
have scarc dream of thei see at it nearest distanc onli
35000000 of mile sunward of them a morn star of hope our own
warmer planet green with veget and grei with water with a cloudi
atmospher eloqu of fertil with glimps through it drift
cloud wisp of broad stretch of popul countri and narrow
navycrowd sea
and we men the creatur who inhabit thi earth must be to them at
least as alien and lowli as ar the monkei and lemur to us the
intellectu side of man alreadi admit that life is an incess
struggl for exist and it would seem that thi too is the belief
of the mind upon mar their world is far gone in it cool and thi
world is still crowd with life but crowd onli with what thei
regard as inferior anim to carri warfar sunward is inde their
onli escap from the destruct that gener after gener
creep upon them
and befor we judg of them too harshli we must rememb what ruthless
and utter destruct our own speci ha wrought not onli upon
anim such as the vanish bison and the dodo but upon it inferior
race the tasmanian in spite of their human like were entir
swept out of exist in a war of extermin wage by european
immigr in the space of fifti year ar we such apostl of merci
as to complain if the martian war in the same spirit
the martian seem to have calcul their descent with amaz
subtletytheir mathemat learn is evid far in excess of
oursand to have carri out their prepar with a wellnigh
perfect unanim had our instrument permit it we might have seen
the gather troubl far back in the nineteenth centuri men like
schiaparelli watch the red planetit is odd bytheby that for
countless centuri mar ha been the star of warbut fail to
interpret the fluctuat appear of the mark thei map so
well all that time the martian must have been get readi
dure the opposit of 1894 a great light wa seen on the illumin
part of the disk first at the lick observatori then by perrotin of
nice and then by other observ english reader heard of it first in
the issu of natur date august 2 i am inclin to think that thi
blaze mai have been the cast of the huge gun in the vast pit sunk
into their planet from which their shot were fire at us peculiar
mark as yet unexplain were seen near the site of that outbreak
dure the next two opposit
the storm burst upon us six year ago now as mar approach
opposit lavel of java set the wire of the astronom exchang
palpit with the amaz intellig of a huge outbreak of
incandesc ga upon the planet it had occur toward midnight of
the twelfth and the spectroscop to which he had at onc resort
indic a mass of flame ga chiefli hydrogen move with an
enorm veloc toward thi earth thi jet of fire had becom
invis about a quarter past twelv he compar it to a coloss
puff of flame suddenli and violent squirt out of the planet as
flame gase rush out of a gun
a singularli appropri phrase it prove yet the next dai there wa
noth of thi in the paper except a littl note in the daili
telegraph and the world went in ignor of on of the gravest
danger that ever threaten the human race i might not have heard of
the erupt at all had i not met ogilvi the wellknown astronom at
ottershaw he wa immens excit at the new and in the excess of
hi feel invit me up to take a turn with him that night in a
scrutini of the red planet
in spite of all that ha happen sinc i still rememb that vigil
veri distinctli the black and silent observatori the shadow lantern
throw a feebl glow upon the floor in the corner the steadi tick
of the clockwork of the telescop the littl slit in the roofan
oblong profund with the stardust streak across it ogilvi move
about invis but audibl look through the telescop on saw a
circl of deep blue and the littl round planet swim in the field
it seem such a littl thing so bright and small and still faintli
mark with transvers stripe and slightli flatten from the perfect
round but so littl it wa so silveri warma pin head of light it
wa as if it quiver but realli thi wa the telescop vibrat with
the activ of the clockwork that kept the planet in view
as i watch the planet seem to grow larger and smaller and to
advanc and reced but that wa simpli that my ey wa tire forti
million of mile it wa from usmor than forti million of mile of
void few peopl realis the immens of vacanc in which the dust of
the materi univers swim
near it in the field i rememb were three faint point of light
three telescop star infinit remot and all around it wa the
unfathom dark of empti space you know how that black look
on a frosti starlight night in a telescop it seem far profound
and invis to me becaus it wa so remot and small fly swiftli
and steadili toward me across that incred distanc draw nearer
everi minut by so mani thousand of mile came the thing thei were
send us the thing that wa to bring so much struggl and calam
and death to the earth i never dream of it then as i watch no on
on earth dream of that uner missil
that night too there wa anoth jet out of ga from the distant
planet i saw it a reddish flash at the edg the slightest project
of the outlin just as the chronomet struck midnight and at that i
told ogilvi and he took my place the night wa warm and i wa thirsti
and i went stretch my leg clumsili and feel my wai in the
dark to the littl tabl where the siphon stood while ogilvi
exclaim at the streamer of ga that came out toward us
that night anoth invis missil start on it wai to the earth
from mar just a second or so under twentyfour hour after the first
on i rememb how i sat on the tabl there in the black with
patch of green and crimson swim befor my ey i wish i had a
light to smoke by littl suspect the mean of the minut gleam i
had seen and all that it would present bring me ogilvi watch till
on and then gave it up and we lit the lantern and walk over to hi
hous down below in the dark were ottershaw and chertsei and all
their hundr of peopl sleep in peac
he wa full of specul that night about the condit of mar and
scof at the vulgar idea of it have inhabit who were
signal us hi idea wa that meteorit might be fall in a heavi
shower upon the planet or that a huge volcan explos wa in
progress he point out to me how unlik it wa that organ
evolut had taken the same direct in the two adjac planet
the chanc against anyth manlik on mar ar a million to on he
said
hundr of observ saw the flame that night and the night after
about midnight and again the night after and so for ten night a
flame each night why the shot ceas after the tenth no on on earth
ha attempt to explain it mai be the gase of the fire caus the
martian inconveni dens cloud of smoke or dust visibl through
a power telescop on earth as littl grei fluctuat patch
spread through the clear of the planet atmospher and obscur
it more familiar featur
even the daili paper woke up to the disturb at last and popular
note appear here there and everywher concern the volcano
upon mar the seriocom period punch i rememb made a happi
us of it in the polit cartoon and all unsuspect those
missil the martian had fire at us drew earthward rush now at a
pace of mani mile a second through the empti gulf of space hour by
hour and dai by dai nearer and nearer it seem to me now almost
incred wonder that with that swift fate hang over us men
could go about their petti concern as thei did i rememb how
jubil markham wa at secur a new photograph of the planet for the
illustr paper he edit in those dai peopl in these latter time
scarc realis the abund and enterpris of our nineteenthcenturi
paper for my own part i wa much occupi in learn to ride the
bicycl and busi upon a seri of paper discuss the probabl
develop of moral idea as civilis progress
on night the first missil then could scarc have been 10000000
mile awai i went for a walk with my wife it wa starlight and i
explain the sign of the zodiac to her and point out mar a
bright dot of light creep zenithward toward which so mani
telescop were point it wa a warm night come home a parti of
excursionist from chertsei or isleworth pass us sing and plai
music there were light in the upper window of the hous as the
peopl went to bed from the railwai station in the distanc came the
sound of shunt train ring and rumbl soften almost into
melodi by the distanc my wife point out to me the bright of the
red green and yellow signal light hang in a framework against the
sky it seem so safe and tranquil
ii
the fall star
then came the night of the first fall star it wa seen earli in the
morn rush over winchest eastward a line of flame high in the
atmospher hundr must have seen it and taken it for an ordinari
fall star albin describ it as leav a greenish streak behind it
that glow for some second den our greatest author on
meteorit state that the height of it first appear wa about
nineti or on hundr mile it seem to him that it fell to earth
about on hundr mile east of him
i wa at home at that hour and write in my studi and although my
french window face toward ottershaw and the blind wa up for i love
in those dai to look up at the night sky i saw noth of it yet
thi strangest of all thing that ever came to earth from outer space
must have fallen while i wa sit there visibl to me had i onli
look up as it pass some of those who saw it flight sai it
travel with a hiss sound i myself heard noth of that mani
peopl in berkshir surrei and middlesex must have seen the fall of
it and at most have thought that anoth meteorit had descend no
on seem to have troubl to look for the fallen mass that night
but veri earli in the morn poor ogilvi who had seen the shoot
star and who wa persuad that a meteorit lai somewher on the common
between horsel ottershaw and woke rose earli with the idea of
find it find it he did soon after dawn and not far from the
sandpit an enorm hole had been made by the impact of the
projectil and the sand and gravel had been flung violent in everi
direct over the heath form heap visibl a mile and a half awai
the heather wa on fire eastward and a thin blue smoke rose against
the dawn
the thing itself lai almost entir buri in sand amidst the
scatter splinter of a fir tree it had shiver to fragment in it
descent the uncov part had the appear of a huge cylind
cake over and it outlin soften by a thick scali duncolour
incrust it had a diamet of about thirti yard he approach
the mass surpris at the size and more so at the shape sinc most
meteorit ar round more or less complet it wa howev still
so hot from it flight through the air as to forbid hi near approach
a stir nois within it cylind he ascrib to the unequ cool
of it surfac for at that time it had not occur to him that it
might be hollow
he remain stand at the edg of the pit that the thing had made for
itself stare at it strang appear astonish chiefli at it
unusu shape and colour and dimli perceiv even then some evid
of design in it arriv the earli morn wa wonderfulli still and
the sun just clear the pine tree toward weybridg wa alreadi
warm he did not rememb hear ani bird that morn there wa
certainli no breez stir and the onli sound were the faint
movement from within the cinderi cylind he wa all alon on the
common
then suddenli he notic with a start that some of the grei clinker
the ashi incrust that cover the meteorit wa fall off the
circular edg of the end it wa drop off in flake and rain
down upon the sand a larg piec suddenli came off and fell with a
sharp nois that brought hi heart into hi mouth
for a minut he scarc realis what thi meant and although the
heat wa excess he clamber down into the pit close to the bulk to
see the thing more clearli he fanci even then that the cool of
the bodi might account for thi but what disturb that idea wa the
fact that the ash wa fall onli from the end of the cylind
and then he perceiv that veri slowli the circular top of the
cylind wa rotat on it bodi it wa such a gradual movement that
he discov it onli through notic that a black mark that had been
near him five minut ago wa now at the other side of the
circumfer even then he scarc understood what thi indic
until he heard a muffl grate sound and saw the black mark jerk
forward an inch or so then the thing came upon him in a flash the
cylind wa artificialhollowwith an end that screw out someth
within the cylind wa unscrew the top
good heaven said ogilvi there a man in itmen in it half
roast to death try to escap
at onc with a quick mental leap he link the thing with the flash
upon mar
the thought of the confin creatur wa so dread to him that he
forgot the heat and went forward to the cylind to help turn but
luckili the dull radiat arrest him befor he could burn hi hand
on the stillglow metal at that he stood irresolut for a moment
then turn scrambl out of the pit and set off run wildli into
woke the time then must have been somewher about six oclock he
met a waggon and tri to make him understand but the tale he told
and hi appear were so wildhi hat had fallen off in the pitthat
the man simpli drove on he wa equal unsuccess with the potman
who wa just unlock the door of the publichous by horsel bridg
the fellow thought he wa a lunat at larg and made an unsuccess
attempt to shut him into the taproom that sober him a littl and
when he saw henderson the london journalist in hi garden he call
over the pale and made himself understood
henderson he call you saw that shoot star last night
well said henderson
it out on horsel common now
good lord said henderson fallen meteorit that good
but it someth more than a meteorit it a cylinderan
artifici cylind man and there someth insid
henderson stood up with hi spade in hi hand
what that he said he wa deaf in on ear
ogilvi told him all that he had seen henderson wa a minut or so
take it in then he drop hi spade snatch up hi jacket and
came out into the road the two men hurri back at onc to the common
and found the cylind still ly in the same posit but now the
sound insid had ceas and a thin circl of bright metal show
between the top and the bodi of the cylind air wa either enter
or escap at the rim with a thin sizzl sound
thei listen rap on the scali burnt metal with a stick and
meet with no respons thei both conclud the man or men insid
must be insens or dead
of cours the two were quit unabl to do anyth thei shout
consol and promis and went off back to the town again to get
help on can imagin them cover with sand excit and disord
run up the littl street in the bright sunlight just as the shop
folk were take down their shutter and peopl were open their
bedroom window henderson went into the railwai station at onc in
order to telegraph the new to london the newspap articl had
prepar men mind for the recept of the idea
by eight oclock a number of boi and unemploi men had alreadi
start for the common to see the dead men from mar that wa the
form the stori took i heard of it first from my newspap boi about a
quarter to nine when i went out to get my daili chronicl i wa
natur startl and lost no time in go out and across the
ottershaw bridg to the sandpit
iii
on horsel common
i found a littl crowd of perhap twenti peopl surround the huge
hole in which the cylind lai i have alreadi describ the appear
of that coloss bulk embed in the ground the turf and gravel
about it seem char as if by a sudden explos no doubt it
impact had caus a flash of fire henderson and ogilvi were not there
i think thei perceiv that noth wa to be done for the present and
had gone awai to breakfast at henderson hous
there were four or five boi sit on the edg of the pit with their
feet dangl and amus themselvesuntil i stop thembi throw
stone at the giant mass after i had spoken to them about it thei
began plai at touch in and out of the group of bystand
among these were a coupl of cyclist a job garden i emploi
sometim a girl carri a babi gregg the butcher and hi littl
boi and two or three loafer and golf caddi who were accustom to
hang about the railwai station there wa veri littl talk few of
the common peopl in england had anyth but the vaguest astronom
idea in those dai most of them were stare quietli at the big tabl
like end of the cylind which wa still as ogilvi and henderson had
left it i fanci the popular expect of a heap of char corps
wa disappoint at thi inanim bulk some went awai while i wa
there and other peopl came i clamber into the pit and fanci i
heard a faint movement under my feet the top had certainli ceas to
rotat
it wa onli when i got thu close to it that the strang of thi
object wa at all evid to me at the first glanc it wa realli no
more excit than an overturn carriag or a tree blown across the
road not so much so inde it look like a rusti ga float it
requir a certain amount of scientif educ to perceiv that the
grei scale of the thing wa no common oxid that the yellowishwhit
metal that gleam in the crack between the lid and the cylind had an
unfamiliar hue extraterrestri had no mean for most of the
onlook
at that time it wa quit clear in my own mind that the thing had come
from the planet mar but i judg it improb that it contain ani
live creatur i thought the unscrew might be automat in spite
of ogilvi i still believ that there were men in mar my mind ran
fancifulli on the possibl of it contain manuscript on the
difficulti in translat that might aris whether we should find
coin and model in it and so forth yet it wa a littl too larg for
assur on thi idea i felt an impati to see it open about
eleven as noth seem happen i walk back full of such
thought to my home in mayburi but i found it difficult to get to work
upon my abstract investig
in the afternoon the appear of the common had alter veri much
the earli edit of the even paper had startl london with
enorm headlin
a messag receiv from mar
remark stori from woke
and so forth in addit ogilvi wire to the astronom exchang
had rous everi observatori in the three kingdom
there were half a dozen fly or more from the woke station stand
in the road by the sandpit a basketchais from chobham and a
rather lordli carriag besid that there wa quit a heap of
bicycl in addit a larg number of peopl must have walk in
spite of the heat of the dai from woke and chertsei so that there
wa altogeth quit a consider crowdon or two gaili dress
ladi among the other
it wa glaringli hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind and
the onli shadow wa that of the few scatter pine tree the burn
heather had been extinguish but the level ground toward ottershaw
wa blacken as far as on could see and still give off vertic
streamer of smoke an enterpris sweetstuff dealer in the chobham
road had sent up hi son with a barrowload of green appl and ginger
beer
go to the edg of the pit i found it occupi by a group of about
half a dozen menhenderson ogilvi and a tall fairhair man that i
afterward learn wa stent the astronom royal with sever
workmen wield spade and pickax stent wa give direct in a
clear highpitch voic he wa stand on the cylind which wa
now evid much cooler hi face wa crimson and stream with
perspir and someth seem to have irrit him
a larg portion of the cylind had been uncov though it lower
end wa still embed as soon as ogilvi saw me among the stare
crowd on the edg of the pit he call to me to come down and ask me
if i would mind go over to see lord hilton the lord of the manor
the grow crowd he said wa becom a seriou impedi to their
excav especi the boi thei want a light rail put up
and help to keep the peopl back he told me that a faint stir wa
occasion still audibl within the case but that the workmen had
fail to unscrew the top as it afford no grip to them the case
appear to be enorm thick and it wa possibl that the faint
sound we heard repres a noisi tumult in the interior
i wa veri glad to do as he ask and so becom on of the privileg
spectat within the contempl enclosur i fail to find lord
hilton at hi hous but i wa told he wa expect from london by the
six oclock train from waterloo and as it wa then about a quarter
past five i went home had some tea and walk up to the station to
waylai him
iv
the cylind open
when i return to the common the sun wa set scatter group
were hurri from the direct of woke and on or two person were
return the crowd about the pit had increas and stood out black
against the lemon yellow of the skya coupl of hundr peopl
perhap there were rais voic and some sort of struggl appear
to be go on about the pit strang imagin pass through my
mind as i drew nearer i heard stent voic
keep back keep back
a boi came run toward me
it amovin he said to me as he pass ascrewin and ascrewin
out i dont like it im agoin om i am
i went on to the crowd there were realli i should think two or three
hundr peopl elbow and jostl on anoth the on or two ladi
there be by no mean the least activ
he fallen in the pit cri some on
keep back said sever
the crowd swai a littl and i elbow my wai through everi on
seem greatli excit i heard a peculiar hum sound from the pit
i sai said ogilvi help keep these idiot back we dont know
what in the confound thing you know
i saw a young man a shop assist in woke i believ he wa
stand on the cylind and try to scrambl out of the hole again
the crowd had push him in
the end of the cylind wa be screw out from within nearli two
feet of shine screw project somebodi blunder against me and i
narrowli miss be pitch onto the top of the screw i turn and
as i did so the screw must have come out for the lid of the cylind
fell upon the gravel with a ring concuss i stuck my elbow into
the person behind me and turn my head toward the thing again for a
moment that circular caviti seem perfectli black i had the sunset in
my ey
i think everyon expect to see a man emergeposs someth a
littl unlik us terrestri men but in all essenti a man i know i
did but look i present saw someth stir within the
shadow greyish billowi movement on abov anoth and then two
lumin diskslik ey then someth resembl a littl grei
snake about the thick of a walk stick coil up out of the
writh middl and wriggl in the air toward meand then anoth
a sudden chill came over me there wa a loud shriek from a woman
behind i half turn keep my ey fix upon the cylind still
from which other tentacl were now project and began push my
wai back from the edg of the pit i saw astonish give place to
horror on the face of the peopl about me i heard inarticul
exclam on all side there wa a gener movement backward i
saw the shopman struggl still on the edg of the pit i found myself
alon and saw the peopl on the other side of the pit run off
stent among them i look again at the cylind and ungovern
terror grip me i stood petrifi and stare
a big greyish round bulk the size perhap of a bear wa rise
slowli and painfulli out of the cylind as it bulg up and caught
the light it glisten like wet leather
two larg darkcolour ey were regard me steadfastli the mass
that frame them the head of the thing wa round and had on
might sai a face there wa a mouth under the ey the lipless brim
of which quiver and pant and drop saliva the whole creatur
heav and pulsat convuls a lank tentacular appendag grip
the edg of the cylind anoth swai in the air
those who have never seen a live martian can scarc imagin the
strang horror of it appear the peculiar vshape mouth with it
point upper lip the absenc of brow ridg the absenc of a chin
beneath the wedgelik lower lip the incess quiver of thi mouth
the gorgon group of tentacl the tumultu breath of the lung
in a strang atmospher the evid heavi and pain of
movement due to the greater gravit energi of the earthabov
all the extraordinari intens of the immens eyeswer at onc
vital intens inhuman crippl and monstrou there wa someth
fungoid in the oili brown skin someth in the clumsi deliber of
the tediou movement unspeak nasti even at thi first encount
thi first glimps i wa overcom with disgust and dread
suddenli the monster vanish it had toppl over the brim of the
cylind and fallen into the pit with a thud like the fall of a great
mass of leather i heard it give a peculiar thick cry and forthwith
anoth of these creatur appear darkli in the deep shadow of the
apertur
i turn and run madli made for the first group of tree perhap
a hundr yard awai but i ran slantingli and stumbl for i could
not avert my face from these thing
there among some young pine tree and furz bush i stop
pant and wait further develop the common round the
sandpit wa dot with peopl stand like myself in a
halffascin terror stare at these creatur or rather at the
heap gravel at the edg of the pit in which thei lai and then with
a renew horror i saw a round black object bob up and down on
the edg of the pit it wa the head of the shopman who had fallen in
but show as a littl black object against the hot western sun now
he got hi shoulder and knee up and again he seem to slip back until
onli hi head wa visibl suddenli he vanish and i could have
fanci a faint shriek had reach me i had a momentari impuls to go
back and help him that my fear overrul
everyth wa then quit invis hidden by the deep pit and the
heap of sand that the fall of the cylind had made anyon come
along the road from chobham or woke would have been amaz at the
sighta dwindl multitud of perhap a hundr peopl or more
stand in a great irregular circl in ditch behind bush behind
gate and hedg sai littl to on anoth and that in short
excit shout and stare stare hard at a few heap of sand the
barrow of ginger beer stood a queer derelict black against the
burn sky and in the sandpit wa a row of desert vehicl with
their hors feed out of nosebag or paw the ground
v
the heatrai
after the glimps i had had of the martian emerg from the cylind
in which thei had come to the earth from their planet a kind of
fascin paralys my action i remain stand kneedeep in the
heather stare at the mound that hid them i wa a battleground of
fear and curios
i did not dare to go back toward the pit but i felt a passion
long to peer into it i began walk therefor in a big curv
seek some point of vantag and continu look at the sandheap
that hid these newcom to our earth onc a leash of thin black
whip like the arm of an octopu flash across the sunset and wa
immedi withdrawn and afterward a thin rod rose up joint by
joint bear at it apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbl
motion what could be go on there
most of the spectat had gather in on or two groupson a littl
crowd toward woke the other a knot of peopl in the direct of
chobham evid thei share my mental conflict there were few near
me on man i approachedh wa i perceiv a neighbour of mine
though i did not know hi nameand accost but it wa scarc a time
for articul convers
what ugli brute he said good god what ugli brute he
repeat thi over and over again
did you see a man in the pit i said but he made no answer to that
we becam silent and stood watch for a time side by side deriv
i fanci a certain comfort in on anoth compani then i shift my
posit to a littl knoll that gave me the advantag of a yard or more
of elev and when i look for him present he wa walk toward
woke
the sunset fade to twilight befor anyth further happen the
crowd far awai on the left toward woke seem to grow and i heard
now a faint murmur from it the littl knot of peopl toward chobham
dispers there wa scarc an intim of movement from the pit
it wa thi as much as anyth that gave peopl courag and i
suppos the new arriv from woke also help to restor confid
at ani rate as the dusk came on a slow intermitt movement upon the
sandpit began a movement that seem to gather forc as the
still of the even about the cylind remain unbroken vertic
black figur in two and three would advanc stop watch and
advanc again spread out as thei did so in a thin irregular
crescent that promis to enclos the pit in it attenu horn i
too on my side began to move toward the pit
then i saw some cabmen and other had walk boldli into the sandpit
and heard the clatter of hoof and the gride of wheel i saw a lad
trundl off the barrow of appl and then within thirti yard of
the pit advanc from the direct of horsel i note a littl
black knot of men the foremost of whom wa wave a white flag
thi wa the deput there had been a hasti consult and sinc
the martian were evid in spite of their repuls form
intellig creatur it had been resolv to show them by
approach them with signal that we too were intellig
flutter flutter went the flag first to the right then to the left
it wa too far for me to recognis anyon there but afterward i
learn that ogilvi stent and henderson were with other in thi
attempt at commun thi littl group had in it advanc drag
inward so to speak the circumfer of the now almost complet
circl of peopl and a number of dim black figur follow it at
discreet distanc
suddenli there wa a flash of light and a quantiti of lumin
greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puff which drove
up on after the other straight into the still air
thi smoke or flame perhap would be the better word for it wa so
bright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazi stretch of brown
common toward chertsei set with black pine tree seem to darken
abruptli as these puff aros and to remain the darker after their
dispers at the same time a faint hiss sound becam audibl
beyond the pit stood the littl wedg of peopl with the white flag at
it apex arrest by these phenomena a littl knot of small vertic
black shape upon the black ground as the green smoke aros their
face flash out pallid green and fade again as it vanish then
slowli the hiss pass into a hum into a long loud drone
nois slowli a hump shape rose out of the pit and the ghost of a
beam of light seem to flicker out from it
forthwith flash of actual flame a bright glare leap from on to
anoth sprang from the scatter group of men it wa as if some
invis jet imping upon them and flash into white flame it wa
as if each man were suddenli and momentarili turn to fire
then by the light of their own destruct i saw them stagger and
fall and their support turn to run
i stood stare not as yet realis that thi wa death leap from
man to man in that littl distant crowd all i felt wa that it wa
someth veri strang an almost noiseless and blind flash of
light and a man fell headlong and lai still and as the unseen shaft
of heat pass over them pine tree burst into fire and everi dry
furz bush becam with on dull thud a mass of flame and far awai
toward knaphil i saw the flash of tree and hedg and wooden
build suddenli set alight
it wa sweep round swiftli and steadili thi flame death thi
invis inevit sword of heat i perceiv it come toward me
by the flash bush it touch and wa too astound and stupefi
to stir i heard the crackl of fire in the sandpit and the sudden
squeal of a hors that wa as suddenli still then it wa as if an
invis yet intens heat finger were drawn through the heather
between me and the martian and all along a curv line beyond the
sandpit the dark ground smoke and crackl someth fell with a
crash far awai to the left where the road from woke station open out
on the common forthwith the hiss and hum ceas and the
black domelik object sank slowli out of sight into the pit
all thi had happen with such swift that i had stood motionless
dumbfound and dazzl by the flash of light had that death swept
through a full circl it must inevit have slain me in my surpris
but it pass and spare me and left the night about me suddenli dark
and unfamiliar
the undul common seem now dark almost to black except where
it roadwai lai grei and pale under the deep blue sky of the earli
night it wa dark and suddenli void of men overhead the star were
muster and in the west the sky wa still a pale bright almost
greenish blue the top of the pine tree and the roof of horsel came
out sharp and black against the western afterglow the martian and
their applianc were altogeth invis save for that thin mast
upon which their restless mirror wobbl patch of bush and isol
tree here and there smoke and glow still and the hous toward
woke station were send up spire of flame into the still of
the even air
noth wa chang save for that and a terribl astonish the
littl group of black speck with the flag of white had been swept out
of exist and the still of the even so it seem to me had
scarc been broken
it came to me that i wa upon thi dark common helpless unprotect
and alon suddenli like a thing fall upon me from without
camefear
with an effort i turn and began a stumbl run through the heather
the fear i felt wa no ration fear but a panic terror not onli of
the martian but of the dusk and still all about me such an
extraordinari effect in unman me it had that i ran weep silent
as a child might do onc i had turn i did not dare to look back
i rememb i felt an extraordinari persuas that i wa be plai
with that present when i wa upon the veri verg of safeti thi
mysteri deatha swift as the passag of lightwould leap after me
from the pit about the cylind and strike me down
vi
the heatrai in the chobham road
it is still a matter of wonder how the martian ar abl to slai men so
swiftli and so silent mani think that in some wai thei ar abl to
gener an intens heat in a chamber of practic absolut
nonconduct thi intens heat thei project in a parallel beam
against ani object thei choos by mean of a polish parabol mirror
of unknown composit much as the parabol mirror of a lighthous
project a beam of light but no on ha absolut prove these
detail howev it is done it is certain that a beam of heat is the
essenc of the matter heat and invis instead of visibl light
whatev is combust flash into flame at it touch lead run like
water it soften iron crack and melt glass and when it fall upon
water incontin that explod into steam
that night nearli forti peopl lai under the starlight about the pit
char and distort beyond recognit and all night long the common
from horsel to mayburi wa desert and brightli ablaz
the new of the massacr probabl reach chobham woke and
ottershaw about the same time in woke the shop had close when the
tragedi happen and a number of peopl shop peopl and so forth
attract by the stori thei had heard were walk over the horsel
bridg and along the road between the hedg that run out at last upon
the common you mai imagin the young peopl brush up after the
labour of the dai and make thi novelti as thei would make ani
novelti the excus for walk togeth and enjoi a trivial
flirtat you mai figur to yourself the hum of voic along the road
in the gloam
as yet of cours few peopl in woke even knew that the cylind had
open though poor henderson had sent a messeng on a bicycl to the
post offic with a special wire to an even paper
as these folk came out by two and three upon the open thei found
littl knot of peopl talk excitedli and peer at the spin
mirror over the sandpit and the newcom were no doubt soon
infect by the excit of the occas
by half past eight when the deput wa destroi there mai have
been a crowd of three hundr peopl or more at thi place besid
those who had left the road to approach the martian nearer there were
three policemen too on of whom wa mount do their best under
instruct from stent to keep the peopl back and deter them from
approach the cylind there wa some boo from those more
thoughtless and excit soul to whom a crowd is alwai an occas
for nois and horseplai
stent and ogilvi anticip some possibl of a collis had
telegraph from horsel to the barrack as soon as the martian
emerg for the help of a compani of soldier to protect these strang
creatur from violenc after that thei return to lead that
illfat advanc the descript of their death as it wa seen by
the crowd talli veri close with my own impress the three
puff of green smoke the deep hum note and the flash of flame
but that crowd of peopl had a far narrow escap than mine onli the
fact that a hummock of heatheri sand intercept the lower part of the
heatrai save them had the elev of the parabol mirror been a
few yard higher none could have live to tell the tale thei saw the
flash and the men fall and an invis hand as it were lit the
bush as it hurri toward them through the twilight then with a
whistl note that rose abov the drone of the pit the beam swung
close over their head light the top of the beech tree that line
the road and split the brick smash the window fire the
window frame and bring down in crumbl ruin a portion of the
gabl of the hous nearest the corner
in the sudden thud hiss and glare of the ignit tree the
panicstricken crowd seem to have swai hesitatingli for some
moment spark and burn twig began to fall into the road and
singl leav like puff of flame hat and dress caught fire then
came a cry from the common there were shriek and shout and
suddenli a mount policeman came gallop through the confus with
hi hand clasp over hi head scream
theyr come a woman shriek and incontin everyon wa
turn and push at those behind in order to clear their wai to
woke again thei must have bolt as blindli as a flock of sheep
where the road grow narrow and black between the high bank the crowd
jam and a desper struggl occur all that crowd did not
escap three person at least two women and a littl boi were
crush and trampl there and left to die amid the terror and the
dark

how i reach home
for my own part i rememb noth of my flight except the stress of
blunder against tree and stumbl through the heather all about
me gather the invis terror of the martian that pitiless sword
of heat seem whirl to and fro flourish overhead befor it
descend and smote me out of life i came into the road between the
crossroad and horsel and ran along thi to the crossroad
at last i could go no further i wa exhaust with the violenc of my
emot and of my flight and i stagger and fell by the waysid that
wa near the bridg that cross the canal by the gaswork i fell and
lai still
i must have remain there some time
i sat up strang perplex for a moment perhap i could not
clearli understand how i came there my terror had fallen from me like
a garment my hat had gone and my collar had burst awai from it
fasten a few minut befor there had onli been three real thing
befor meth immens of the night and space and natur my own
feebl and anguish and the near approach of death now it wa as
if someth turn over and the point of view alter abruptli there
wa no sensibl transit from on state of mind to the other i wa
immedi the self of everi dai againa decent ordinari citizen the
silent common the impuls of my flight the start flame were as
if thei had been in a dream i ask myself had these latter thing
inde happen i could not credit it
i rose and walk unsteadili up the steep inclin of the bridg my
mind wa blank wonder my muscl and nerv seem drain of their
strength i dare sai i stagger drunkenli a head rose over the arch
and the figur of a workman carri a basket appear besid him ran
a littl boi he pass me wish me good night i wa mind to
speak to him but did not i answer hi greet with a meaningless
mumbl and went on over the bridg
over the mayburi arch a train a billow tumult of white firelit
smoke and a long caterpillar of light window went fly
southclatt clatter clap rap and it had gone a dim group of
peopl talk in the gate of on of the hous in the pretti littl row
of gabl that wa call orient terrac it wa all so real and so
familiar and that behind me it wa frantic fantast such thing i
told myself could not be
perhap i am a man of except mood i do not know how far my
experi is common at time i suffer from the strangest sens of
detach from myself and the world about me i seem to watch it all
from the outsid from somewher inconceiv remot out of time out
of space out of the stress and tragedi of it all thi feel wa
veri strong upon me that night here wa anoth side to my dream
but the troubl wa the blank incongru of thi seren and the
swift death fly yonder not two mile awai there wa a nois of
busi from the gaswork and the electr lamp were all alight i
stop at the group of peopl
what new from the common said i
there were two men and a woman at the gate
eh said on of the men turn
what new from the common i said
aint yer just been there ask the men
peopl seem fair silli about the common said the woman over the
gate what it all abart
havent you heard of the men from mar said i the creatur from
mar
quit enough said the woman over the gate thenk and all three
of them laugh
i felt foolish and angri i tri and found i could not tell them what
i had seen thei laugh again at my broken sentenc
youll hear more yet i said and went on to my home
i startl my wife at the doorwai so haggard wa i i went into the
dine room sat down drank some wine and so soon as i could collect
myself suffici i told her the thing i had seen the dinner which
wa a cold on had alreadi been serv and remain neglect on the
tabl while i told my stori
there is on thing i said to allai the fear i had arous thei
ar the most sluggish thing i ever saw crawl thei mai keep the pit
and kill peopl who come near them but thei cannot get out of it
but the horror of them
dont dear said my wife knit her brow and put her hand on
mine
poor ogilvi i said to think he mai be ly dead there
my wife at least did not find my experi incred when i saw how
deadli white her face wa i ceas abruptli
thei mai come here she said again and again
i press her to take wine and tri to reassur her
thei can scarc move i said
i began to comfort her and myself by repeat all that ogilvi had told
me of the imposs of the martian establish themselv on the
earth in particular i laid stress on the gravit difficulti on
the surfac of the earth the forc of graviti is three time what it is
on the surfac of mar a martian therefor would weigh three time
more than on mar albeit hi muscular strength would be the same hi
own bodi would be a cope of lead to him therefor that inde wa
the gener opinion both the time and the daili telegraph for
instanc insist on it the next morn and both overlook just as
i did two obviou modifi influenc
the atmospher of the earth we now know contain far more oxygen or
far less argon whichev wai on like to put it than doe mar the
invigor influenc of thi excess of oxygen upon the martian
indisput did much to counterbal the increas weight of their
bodi and in the second place we all overlook the fact that such
mechan intellig as the martian possess wa quit abl to
dispens with muscular exert at a pinch
but i did not consid these point at the time and so my reason
wa dead against the chanc of the invad with wine and food the
confid of my own tabl and the necess of reassur my wife i
grew by insens degre courag and secur
thei have done a foolish thing said i finger my wineglass thei
ar danger becaus no doubt thei ar mad with terror perhap thei
expect to find no live thingscertainli no intellig live
thing
a shell in the pit said i if the worst come to the worst will
kill them all
the intens excit of the event had no doubt left my percept
power in a state of ereth i rememb that dinner tabl with
extraordinari vivid even now my dear wife sweet anxiou face
peer at me from under the pink lamp shade the white cloth with it
silver and glass tabl furniturefor in those dai even philosoph
writer had mani littl luxuriesth crimsonpurpl wine in my glass
ar photograph distinct at the end of it i sat temper nut
with a cigarett regret ogilvi rash and denounc the
shortsight timid of the martian
so some respect dodo in the mauritiu might have lord it in hi
nest and discuss the arriv of that ship of pitiless sailor in
want of anim food we will peck them to death tomorrow my dear
i did not know it but that wa the last civilis dinner i wa to eat
for veri mani strang and terribl dai
viii
fridai night
the most extraordinari thing to my mind of all the strang and
wonder thing that happen upon that fridai wa the dovetail of
the commonplac habit of our social order with the first begin of
the seri of event that wa to toppl that social order headlong if
on fridai night you had taken a pair of compass and drawn a circl
with a radiu of five mile round the woke sandpit i doubt if you
would have had on human be outsid it unless it were some relat
of stent or of the three or four cyclist or london peopl ly dead
on the common whose emot or habit were at all affect by the
newcom mani peopl had heard of the cylind of cours and
talk about it in their leisur but it certainli did not make the
sensat that an ultimatum to germani would have done
in london that night poor henderson telegram describ the gradual
unscrew of the shot wa judg to be a canard and hi even
paper after wire for authent from him and receiv no
replyth man wa killeddecid not to print a special edit
even within the fivemil circl the great major of peopl were
inert i have alreadi describ the behaviour of the men and women to
whom i spoke all over the district peopl were dine and sup
work men were garden after the labour of the dai children were
be put to bed young peopl were wander through the lane
lovemak student sat over their book
mayb there wa a murmur in the villag street a novel and domin
topic in the publichous and here and there a messeng or even an
eyewit of the later occurr caus a whirl of excit a
shout and a run to and fro but for the most part the daili
routin of work eat drink sleep went on as it had done
for countless yearsa though no planet mar exist in the sky even
at woke station and horsel and chobham that wa the case
in woke junction until a late hour train were stop and go
on other were shunt on the side passeng were alight and
wait and everyth wa proceed in the most ordinari wai a boi
from the town trench on smith monopoli wa sell paper with
the afternoon new the ring impact of truck the sharp whistl
of the engin from the junction mingl with their shout of men
from mar excit men came into the station about nine oclock with
incred tide and caus no more disturb than drunkard might
have done peopl rattl londonward peer into the dark outsid
the carriag window and saw onli a rare flicker vanish spark
danc up from the direct of horsel a red glow and a thin veil of
smoke drive across the star and thought that noth more seriou
than a heath fire wa happen it wa onli round the edg of the
common that ani disturb wa percept there were half a dozen
villa burn on the woke border there were light in all the
hous on the common side of the three villag and the peopl there
kept awak till dawn
a curiou crowd linger restlessli peopl come and go but the
crowd remain both on the chobham and horsel bridg on or two
adventur soul it wa afterward found went into the dark and
crawl quit near the martian but thei never return for now and
again a lightrai like the beam of a warship searchlight swept the
common and the heatrai wa readi to follow save for such that big
area of common wa silent and desol and the char bodi lai
about on it all night under the star and all the next dai a nois of
hammer from the pit wa heard by mani peopl
so you have the state of thing on fridai night in the centr
stick into the skin of our old planet earth like a poison dart
wa thi cylind but the poison wa scarc work yet around it
wa a patch of silent common smoulder in place and with a few
dark dimli seen object ly in contort attitud here and there
here and there wa a burn bush or tree beyond wa a fring of
excit and farther than that fring the inflamm had not crept
as yet in the rest of the world the stream of life still flow as it
had flow for immemori year the fever of war that would present
clog vein and arteri deaden nerv and destroi brain had still to
develop
all night long the martian were hammer and stir sleepless
indefatig at work upon the machin thei were make readi and
ever and again a puff of greenishwhit smoke whirl up to the starlit
sky
about eleven a compani of soldier came through horsel and deploi
along the edg of the common to form a cordon later a second compani
march through chobham to deploi on the north side of the common
sever offic from the inkerman barrack had been on the common
earlier in the dai and on major eden wa report to be miss
the colonel of the regiment came to the chobham bridg and wa busi
question the crowd at midnight the militari author were
certainli aliv to the serious of the busi about eleven the
next morn paper were abl to sai a squadron of hussar two
maxim and about four hundr men of the cardigan regiment start
from aldershot
a few second after midnight the crowd in the chertsei road woke
saw a star fall from heaven into the pine wood to the northwest it
had a greenish colour and caus a silent bright like summer
lightn thi wa the second cylind
ix
the fight begin
saturdai live in my memori as a dai of suspens it wa a dai of
lassitud too hot and close with i am told a rapidli fluctuat
baromet i had slept but littl though my wife had succeed in
sleep and i rose earli i went into my garden befor breakfast and
stood listen but toward the common there wa noth stir but
a lark
the milkman came as usual i heard the rattl of hi chariot and i went
round to the side gate to ask the latest new he told me that dure
the night the martian had been surround by troop and that gun
were expect thena familiar reassur notei heard a train run
toward woke
thei arent to be kill said the milkman if that can possibl be
avoid
i saw my neighbour garden chat with him for a time and then
stroll in to breakfast it wa a most unexcept morn my
neighbour wa of opinion that the troop would be abl to captur or to
destroi the martian dure the dai
it a piti thei make themselv so unapproach he said it
would be curiou to know how thei live on anoth planet we might
learn a thing or two
he came up to the fenc and extend a hand of strawberri for hi
garden wa as gener as it wa enthusiast at the same time he
told me of the burn of the pine wood about the byfleet golf link
thei sai said he that there anoth of those bless thing
fallen therenumb two but on enough sure thi lotll cost the
insur peopl a pretti penni befor everyth settl he
laugh with an air of the greatest good humour as he said thi the
wood he said were still burn and point out a haze of smoke to
me thei will be hot under foot for dai on account of the thick soil
of pine needl and turf he said and then grew seriou over poor
ogilvi
after breakfast instead of work i decid to walk down toward the
common under the railwai bridg i found a group of soldierssapp i
think men in small round cap dirti red jacket unbutton and
show their blue shirt dark trouser and boot come to the calf
thei told me no on wa allow over the canal and look along the
road toward the bridg i saw on of the cardigan men stand
sentinel there i talk with these soldier for a time i told them of
my sight of the martian on the previou even none of them had seen
the martian and thei had but the vaguest idea of them so that thei
pli me with question thei said that thei did not know who had
authoris the movement of the troop their idea wa that a disput
had arisen at the hors guard the ordinari sapper is a great deal
better educ than the common soldier and thei discuss the
peculiar condit of the possibl fight with some acut i
describ the heatrai to them and thei began to argu among
themselv
crawl up under cover and rush em sai i said on
get aht said anoth what cover against thi er eat stick
to cook yer what we got to do is to go as near as the groundll let
us and then drive a trench
blow yer trench you alwai want trench you ought to ha been
born a rabbit snippi
aint thei got ani neck then said a third abruptlya littl
contempl dark man smoke a pipe
i repeat my descript
octopus said he that what i call em talk about fisher of
menfight of fish it is thi time
it aint no murder kill beast like that said the first speaker
why not shell the darn thing strite off and finish em said the
littl dark man you carn tell what thei might do
where your shell said the first speaker there aint no time do
it in a rush that my tip and do it at onc
so thei discuss it after a while i left them and went on to the
railwai station to get as mani morn paper as i could
but i will not weari the reader with a descript of that long morn
and of the longer afternoon i did not succe in get a glimps of
the common for even horsel and chobham church tower were in the
hand of the militari author the soldier i address didnt know
anyth the offic were mysteri as well as busi i found peopl
in the town quit secur again in the presenc of the militari and i
heard for the first time from marshal the tobacconist that hi son
wa among the dead on the common the soldier had made the peopl on
the outskirt of horsel lock up and leav their hous
i got back to lunch about two veri tire for as i have said the dai
wa extrem hot and dull and in order to refresh myself i took a
cold bath in the afternoon about half past four i went up to the
railwai station to get an even paper for the morn paper had
contain onli a veri inaccur descript of the kill of stent
henderson ogilvi and the other but there wa littl i didnt know
the martian did not show an inch of themselv thei seem busi in
their pit and there wa a sound of hammer and an almost continu
streamer of smoke appar thei were busi get readi for a
struggl fresh attempt have been made to signal but without
success wa the stereotyp formula of the paper a sapper told me
it wa done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole the
martian took as much notic of such advanc as we should of the
low of a cow
i must confess the sight of all thi armament all thi prepar
greatli excit me my imagin becam belliger and defeat the
invad in a dozen strike wai someth of my schoolboi dream of
battl and heroism came back it hardli seem a fair fight to me at
that time thei seem veri helpless in that pit of their
about three oclock there began the thud of a gun at measur interv
from chertsei or addleston i learn that the smoulder pine wood
into which the second cylind had fallen wa be shell in the
hope of destroi that object befor it open it wa onli about
five howev that a field gun reach chobham for us against the
first bodi of martian
about six in the even as i sat at tea with my wife in the
summerhous talk vigor about the battl that wa lower upon
us i heard a muffl deton from the common and immedi after
a gust of fire close on the heel of that came a violent rattl
crash quit close to us that shook the ground and start out upon
the lawn i saw the top of the tree about the orient colleg burst
into smoki red flame and the tower of the littl church besid it
slide down into ruin the pinnacl of the mosqu had vanish and the
roof line of the colleg itself look as if a hundredton gun had been
at work upon it on of our chimnei crack as if a shot had hit it
flew and a piec of it came clatter down the tile and made a heap
of broken red fragment upon the flower bed by my studi window
i and my wife stood amaz then i realis that the crest of mayburi
hill must be within rang of the martian heatrai now that the
colleg wa clear out of the wai
at that i grip my wife arm and without ceremoni ran her out into
the road then i fetch out the servant tell her i would go
upstair myself for the box she wa clamour for
we cant possibl stai here i said and as i spoke the fire
reopen for a moment upon the common
but where ar we to go said my wife in terror
i thought perplex then i rememb her cousin at leatherhead
leatherhead i shout abov the sudden nois
she look awai from me downhil the peopl were come out of their
hous astonish
how ar we to get to leatherhead she said
down the hill i saw a bevi of hussar ride under the railwai bridg
three gallop through the open gate of the orient colleg two
other dismount and began run from hous to hous the sun
shine through the smoke that drove up from the top of the tree
seem blood red and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon everyth
stop here said i you ar safe here and i start off at onc for
the spot dog for i knew the landlord had a hors and dog cart i
ran for i perceiv that in a moment everyon upon thi side of the
hill would be move i found him in hi bar quit unawar of what wa
go on behind hi hous a man stood with hi back to me talk to
him

pig two pound and you bring it back what go on now
i explain hastili that i had to leav my home and so secur the dog

landlord should leav hi i took care to have the cart there and then
drove it off down the road and leav it in charg of my wife and
servant rush into my hous and pack a few valuabl such plate as
we had and so forth the beech tree below the hous were burn
while i did thi and the pale up the road glow red while i wa
occupi in thi wai on of the dismount hussar came run up he

as i came out of my front door lug my treasur done up in a
tablecloth i shout after him
what new
he turn stare bawl someth about crawl out in a thing like
a dish cover and ran on to the gate of the hous at the crest a
sudden whirl of black smoke drive across the road hid him for a
moment i ran to my neighbour door and rap to satisfi myself of
what i alreadi knew that hi wife had gone to london with him and had
lock up their hous i went in again accord to my promis to get
my servant box lug it out clap it besid her on the tail of
the dog cart and then caught the rein and jump up into the driver
seat besid my wife in anoth moment we were clear of the smoke and
nois and spank down the opposit slope of mayburi hill toward old
woke
in front wa a quiet sunni landscap a wheat field ahead on either
side of the road and the mayburi inn with it swing sign i saw the
doctor cart ahead of me at the bottom of the hill i turn my head
to look at the hillsid i wa leav thick streamer of black smoke
shot with thread of red fire were drive up into the still air and
throw dark shadow upon the green treetop eastward the smoke
alreadi extend far awai to the east and westto the byfleet pine
wood eastward and to woke on the west the road wa dot with
peopl run toward us and veri faint now but veri distinct
through the hot quiet air on heard the whirr of a machinegun that
wa present still and an intermitt crack of rifl
appar the martian were set fire to everyth within rang of
their heatrai
i am not an expert driver and i had immedi to turn my attent
to the hors when i look back again the second hill had hidden the
black smoke i slash the hors with the whip and gave him a loos
rein until woke and send lai between us and that quiver tumult i
overtook and pass the doctor between woke and send
x
in the storm
leatherhead is about twelv mile from mayburi hill the scent of hai
wa in the air through the lush meadow beyond pyrford and the hedg
on either side were sweet and gai with multitud of dogros the
heavi fire that had broken out while we were drive down mayburi
hill ceas as abruptli as it began leav the even veri peac
and still we got to leatherhead without misadventur about nine
oclock and the hors had an hour rest while i took supper with my
cousin and commend my wife to their care
my wife wa curious silent throughout the drive and seem oppress
with forebod of evil i talk to her reassuringli point out
that the martian were ti to the pit by sheer heavi and at the
utmost could but crawl a littl out of it but she answer onli in
monosyl had it not been for my promis to the innkeep she
would i think have urg me to stai in leatherhead that night would
that i had her face i rememb wa veri white as we part
for my own part i had been feverishli excit all dai someth veri
like the war fever that occasion run through a civilis commun
had got into my blood and in my heart i wa not so veri sorri that i
had to return to mayburi that night i wa even afraid that that last
fusillad i had heard might mean the extermin of our invad from
mar i can best express my state of mind by sai that i want to be
in at the death
it wa nearli eleven when i start to return the night wa
unexpectedli dark to me walk out of the light passag of my
cousin hous it seem inde black and it wa as hot and close as
the dai overhead the cloud were drive fast albeit not a breath
stir the shrub about us my cousin man lit both lamp happili i
knew the road intim my wife stood in the light of the doorwai
and watch me until i jump up into the dog cart then abruptli she
turn and went in leav my cousin side by side wish me good
hap
i wa a littl depress at first with the contagion of my wife
fear but veri soon my thought revert to the martian at that time
i wa absolut in the dark as to the cours of the even
fight i did not know even the circumst that had precipit
the conflict as i came through ockham for that wa the wai i
return and not through send and old woke i saw along the western
horizon a bloodr glow which as i drew nearer crept slowli up the
sky the drive cloud of the gather thunderstorm mingl there
with mass of black and red smoke
riplei street wa desert and except for a light window or so the
villag show not a sign of life but i narrowli escap an accid
at the corner of the road to pyrford where a knot of peopl stood with
their back to me thei said noth to me as i pass i do not know
what thei knew of the thing happen beyond the hill nor do i know
if the silent hous i pass on my wai were sleep secur or
desert and empti or harass and watch against the terror of the
night
from riplei until i came through pyrford i wa in the vallei of the
wei and the red glare wa hidden from me as i ascend the littl
hill beyond pyrford church the glare came into view again and the
tree about me shiver with the first intim of the storm that wa
upon me then i heard midnight peal out from pyrford church behind
me and then came the silhouett of mayburi hill with it treetop
and roof black and sharp against the red
even as i beheld thi a lurid green glare lit the road about me and
show the distant wood toward addleston i felt a tug at the rein
i saw that the drive cloud had been pierc as it were by a thread
of green fire suddenli light their confus and fall into the
field to my left it wa the third fall star
close on it apparit and blindingli violet by contrast danc out
the first lightn of the gather storm and the thunder burst like
a rocket overhead the hors took the bit between hi teeth and bolt
a moder inclin run toward the foot of mayburi hill and down thi
we clatter onc the lightn had begun it went on in as rapid a
success of flash as i have ever seen the thunderclap tread
on on the heel of anoth and with a strang crackl accompani
sound more like the work of a gigant electr machin than the
usual deton reverber the flicker light wa blind and
confus and a thin hail smote gustili at my face as i drove down the
slope
at first i regard littl but the road befor me and then abruptli my
attent wa arrest by someth that wa move rapidli down the
opposit slope of mayburi hill at first i took it for the wet roof of
a hous but on flash follow anoth show it to be in swift
roll movement it wa an elus visiona moment of bewild
dark and then in a flash like daylight the red mass of the
orphanag near the crest of the hill the green top of the pine tree
and thi problemat object came out clear and sharp and bright
and thi thing i saw how can i describ it a monstrou tripod higher
than mani hous stride over the young pine tree and smash them
asid in it career a walk engin of glitter metal stride now
across the heather articul rope of steel dangl from it and the
clatter tumult of it passag mingl with the riot of the thunder
a flash and it came out vividli heel over on wai with two feet in
the air to vanish and reappear almost instantli as it seem with the
next flash a hundr yard nearer can you imagin a milk stool
tilt and bowl violent along the ground that wa the impress
those instant flash gave but instead of a milk stool imagin it a
great bodi of machineri on a tripod stand
then suddenli the tree in the pine wood ahead of me were part as
brittl reed ar part by a man thrust through them thei were
snap off and driven headlong and a second huge tripod appear
rush as it seem headlong toward me and i wa gallop hard to
meet it at the sight of the second monster my nerv went altogeth
not stop to look again i wrench the hors head hard round to
the right and in anoth moment the dog cart had heel over upon the
hors the shaft smash noisili and i wa flung sidewai and fell
heavili into a shallow pool of water
i crawl out almost immedi and crouch my feet still in the
water under a clump of furz the hors lai motionless hi neck wa
broken poor brute and by the lightn flash i saw the black bulk
of the overturn dog cart and the silhouett of the wheel still
spin slowli in anoth moment the coloss mechan went stride
by me and pass uphil toward pyrford
seen nearer the thing wa incred strang for it wa no mere
insens machin drive on it wai machin it wa with a ring
metal pace and long flexibl glitter tentacl on of which
grip a young pine tree swing and rattl about it strang
bodi it pick it road as it went stride along and the brazen hood
that surmount it move to and fro with the inevit suggest of a
head look about behind the main bodi wa a huge mass of white metal
like a gigant fisherman basket and puff of green smoke squirt
out from the joint of the limb as the monster swept by me and in an
instant it wa gone
so much i saw then all vagu for the flicker of the lightn in
blind highlight and dens black shadow
as it pass it set up an exult deafen howl that drown the
thunderaloo alooand in anoth minut it wa with it companion
half a mile awai stoop over someth in the field i have no doubt
thi thing in the field wa the third of the ten cylind thei had
fire at us from mar
for some minut i lai there in the rain and dark watch by the
intermitt light these monstrou be of metal move about in the
distanc over the hedg top a thin hail wa now begin and as it
came and went their figur grew misti and then flash into clear
again now and then came a gap in the lightn and the night
swallow them up
i wa soak with hail abov and puddl water below it wa some time
befor my blank astonish would let me struggl up the bank to a
drier posit or think at all of my immin peril
not far from me wa a littl oneroom squatter hut of wood
surround by a patch of potato garden i struggl to my feet at last
and crouch and make us of everi chanc of cover i made a run
for thi i hammer at the door but i could not make the peopl hear
if there were ani peopl insid and after a time i desist and
avail myself of a ditch for the greater part of the wai succeed
in crawl unobserv by these monstrou machin into the pine
wood toward mayburi
under cover of thi i push on wet and shiver now toward my own
hous i walk among the tree try to find the footpath it wa
veri dark inde in the wood for the lightn wa now becom
infrequ and the hail which wa pour down in a torrent fell in
column through the gap in the heavi foliag
if i had fulli realis the mean of all the thing i had seen i
should have immedi work my wai round through byfleet to street
cobham and so gone back to rejoin my wife at leatherhead but that
night the strang of thing about me and my physic wretched
prevent me for i wa bruis weari wet to the skin deafen and
blind by the storm
i had a vagu idea of go on to my own hous and that wa as much
motiv as i had i stagger through the tree fell into a ditch and
bruis my knee against a plank and final splash out into the
lane that ran down from the colleg arm i sai splash for the storm
water wa sweep the sand down the hill in a muddi torrent there in
the dark a man blunder into me and sent me reel back
he gave a cry of terror sprang sidewai and rush on befor i could
gather my wit suffici to speak to him so heavi wa the stress of
the storm just at thi place that i had the hardest task to win my wai
up the hill i went close up to the fenc on the left and work my wai
along it pale
near the top i stumbl upon someth soft and by a flash of
lightn saw between my feet a heap of black broadcloth and a pair of
boot befor i could distinguish clearli how the man lai the flicker
of light had pass i stood over him wait for the next flash when
it came i saw that he wa a sturdi man cheapli but not shabbili
dress hi head wa bent under hi bodi and he lai crumpl up close
to the fenc as though he had been flung violent against it
overcom the repugn natur to on who had never befor touch a
dead bodi i stoop and turn him over to feel for hi heart he wa
quit dead appar hi neck had been broken the lightn flash
for a third time and hi face leap upon me i sprang to my feet it
wa the landlord of the spot dog whose convey i had taken
i step over him gingerli and push on up the hill i made my wai by
the polic station and the colleg arm toward my own hous noth
wa burn on the hillsid though from the common there still came a
red glare and a roll tumult of ruddi smoke beat up against the
drench hail so far as i could see by the flash the hous about
me were mostli uninjur by the colleg arm a dark heap lai in the
road
down the road toward mayburi bridg there were voic and the sound of
feet but i had not the courag to shout or to go to them i let myself
in with my latchkei close lock and bolt the door stagger to
the foot of the staircas and sat down my imagin wa full of
those stride metal monster and of the dead bodi smash against
the fenc
i crouch at the foot of the staircas with my back to the wall
shiver violent
xi
at the window
i have alreadi said that my storm of emot have a trick of
exhaust themselv after a time i discov that i wa cold and
wet and with littl pool of water about me on the stair carpet i got
up almost mechan went into the dine room and drank some
whiski and then i wa move to chang my cloth
after i had done that i went upstair to my studi but why i did so i
do not know the window of my studi look over the tree and the
railwai toward horsel common in the hurri of our departur thi
window had been left open the passag wa dark and by contrast with
the pictur the window frame enclos the side of the room seem
impenetr dark i stop short in the doorwai
the thunderstorm had pass the tower of the orient colleg and the
pine tree about it had gone and veri far awai lit by a vivid red
glare the common about the sandpit wa visibl across the light
huge black shape grotesqu and strang move busili to and fro
it seem inde as if the whole countri in that direct wa on
firea broad hillsid set with minut tongu of flame swai and
writh with the gust of the dy storm and throw a red
reflect upon the cloud scud abov everi now and then a haze of
smoke from some nearer conflagr drove across the window and hid
the martian shape i could not see what thei were do nor the clear
form of them nor recognis the black object thei were busi upon
neither could i see the nearer fire though the reflect of it
danc on the wall and ceil of the studi a sharp resin tang of
burn wa in the air
i close the door noiselessli and crept toward the window as i did
so the view open out until on the on hand it reach to the
hous about woke station and on the other to the char and
blacken pine wood of byfleet there wa a light down below the hill
on the railwai near the arch and sever of the hous along the
mayburi road and the street near the station were glow ruin the
light upon the railwai puzzl me at first there were a black heap and
a vivid glare and to the right of that a row of yellow oblong then i
perceiv thi wa a wreck train the fore part smash and on fire
the hinder carriag still upon the rail
between these three main centr of lightth hous the train and
the burn counti toward chobhamstretch irregular patch of dark
countri broken here and there by interv of dimli glow and
smoke ground it wa the strangest spectacl that black expans set
with fire it remind me more than anyth els of the potteri at
night at first i could distinguish no peopl at all though i peer
intent for them later i saw against the light of woke station a
number of black figur hurri on after the other across the line
and thi wa the littl world in which i had been live secur for
year thi fieri chao what had happen in the last seven hour i
still did not know nor did i know though i wa begin to guess
the relat between these mechan colossi and the sluggish lump i
had seen disgorg from the cylind with a queer feel of
imperson interest i turn my desk chair to the window sat down and
stare at the blacken countri and particularli at the three gigant
black thing that were go to and fro in the glare about the
sandpit
thei seem amazingli busi i began to ask myself what thei could be
were thei intellig mechan such a thing i felt wa imposs
or did a martian sit within each rule direct us much as a
man brain sit and rule in hi bodi i began to compar the thing
to human machin to ask myself for the first time in my life how an
ironclad or a steam engin would seem to an intellig lower anim
the storm had left the sky clear and over the smoke of the burn
land the littl fade pinpoint of mar wa drop into the west
when a soldier came into my garden i heard a slight scrape at the
fenc and rous myself from the lethargi that had fallen upon me i
look down and saw him dimli clamber over the pale at the
sight of anoth human be my torpor pass and i lean out of the
window eagerli
hist said i in a whisper
he stop astrid of the fenc in doubt then he came over and across
the lawn to the corner of the hous he bent down and step softli
who there he said also whisper stand under the window and
peer up
where ar you go i ask
god know
ar you try to hide
that it
come into the hous i said
i went down unfasten the door and let him in and lock the door
again i could not see hi face he wa hatless and hi coat wa
unbutton
my god he said as i drew him in
what ha happen i ask
what hasnt in the obscur i could see he made a gestur of
despair thei wipe us outsimpli wipe us out he repeat again and
again
he follow me almost mechan into the dine room
take some whiski i said pour out a stiff dose
he drank it then abruptli he sat down befor the tabl put hi head
on hi arm and began to sob and weep like a littl boi in a perfect
passion of emot while i with a curiou forget of my own
recent despair stood besid him wonder
it wa a long time befor he could steadi hi nerv to answer my
question and then he answer perplexingli and brokenli he wa a
driver in the artilleri and had onli come into action about seven at
that time fire wa go on across the common and it wa said the
first parti of martian were crawl slowli toward their second
cylind under cover of a metal shield
later thi shield stagger up on tripod leg and becam the first of
the fightingmachin i had seen the gun he drove had been unlimb
near horsel in order to command the sandpit and it arriv it wa
that had precipit the action as the limber gunner went to the
rear hi hors trod in a rabbit hole and came down throw him into
a depress of the ground at the same moment the gun explod behind
him the ammunit blew up there wa fire all about him and he found
himself ly under a heap of char dead men and dead hors
i lai still he said scare out of my wit with the fore quarter
of a hors atop of me wed been wipe out and the smellgood god
like burnt meat i wa hurt across the back by the fall of the hors
and there i had to lie until i felt better just like parad it had
been a minut beforethen stumbl bang swish
wipe out he said
he had hid under the dead hors for a long time peep out furtiv
across the common the cardigan men had tri a rush in skirmish
order at the pit simpli to be swept out of exist then the
monster had risen to it feet and had begun to walk leisur to and
fro across the common among the few fugit with it headlik hood
turn about exactli like the head of a cowl human be a kind of
arm carri a complic metal case about which green flash
scintil and out of the funnel of thi there smoke the heatrai
in a few minut there wa so far as the soldier could see not a
live thing left upon the common and everi bush and tree upon it that
wa not alreadi a blacken skeleton wa burn the hussar had been
on the road beyond the curvatur of the ground and he saw noth of
them he heard the maxim rattl for a time and then becom still the
giant save woke station and it cluster of hous until the last
then in a moment the heatrai wa brought to bear and the town becam
a heap of fieri ruin then the thing shut off the heatrai and
turn it back upon the artilleryman began to waddl awai toward
the smoulder pine wood that shelter the second cylind as it
did so a second glitter titan built itself up out of the pit
the second monster follow the first and at that the artilleryman
began to crawl veri cautious across the hot heather ash toward
horsel he manag to get aliv into the ditch by the side of the
road and so escap to woke there hi stori becam ejaculatori the
place wa impass it seem there were a few peopl aliv there
frantic for the most part and mani burn and scald he wa turn
asid by the fire and hid among some almost scorch heap of broken
wall as on of the martian giant return he saw thi on pursu a
man catch him up in on of it steeli tentacl and knock hi head
against the trunk of a pine tree at last after nightfal the
artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railwai embank
sinc then he had been skulk along toward mayburi in the hope of
get out of danger londonward peopl were hide in trench and
cellar and mani of the survivor had made off toward woke villag
and send he had been consum with thirst until he found on of the
water main near the railwai arch smash and the water bubbl out
like a spring upon the road
that wa the stori i got from him bit by bit he grew calmer tell
me and try to make me see the thing he had seen he had eaten no
food sinc middai he told me earli in hi narr and i found some
mutton and bread in the pantri and brought it into the room we lit no
lamp for fear of attract the martian and ever and again our hand
would touch upon bread or meat as he talk thing about us came
darkli out of the dark and the trampl bush and broken rose
tree outsid the window grew distinct it would seem that a number of
men or anim had rush across the lawn i began to see hi face
blacken and haggard as no doubt mine wa also
when we had finish eat we went softli upstair to my studi and i
look again out of the open window in on night the vallei had becom
a vallei of ash the fire had dwindl now where flame had been
there were now streamer of smoke but the countless ruin of shatter
and gut hous and blast and blacken tree that the night had
hidden stood out now gaunt and terribl in the pitiless light of dawn
yet here and there some object had had the luck to escapea white
railwai signal here the end of a greenhous there white and fresh
amid the wreckag never befor in the histori of warfar had
destruct been so indiscrimin and so univers and shine with
the grow light of the east three of the metal giant stood about
the pit their cowl rotat as though thei were survei the
desol thei had made
it seem to me that the pit had been enlarg and ever and again
puff of vivid green vapour stream up and out of it toward the
brighten dawnstream up whirl broke and vanish
beyond were the pillar of fire about chobham thei becam pillar of
bloodshot smoke at the first touch of dai
xii
what i saw of the destruct of weybridg and shepperton
as the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which we had
watch the martian and went veri quietli downstair
the artilleryman agre with me that the hous wa no place to stai in
he propos he said to make hi wai londonward and thenc rejoin hi
batteryno 12 of the hors artilleri my plan wa to return at onc
to leatherhead and so greatli had the strength of the martian
impress me that i had determin to take my wife to newhaven and go
with her out of the countri forthwith for i alreadi perceiv clearli
that the countri about london must inevit be the scene of a
disastr struggl befor such creatur as these could be destroi
between us and leatherhead howev lai the third cylind with it
guard giant had i been alon i think i should have taken my
chanc and struck across countri but the artilleryman dissuad me
it no kind to the right sort of wife he said to make her a
widow and in the end i agre to go with him under cover of the
wood northward as far as street cobham befor i part with him
thenc i would make a big detour by epsom to reach leatherhead
i should have start at onc but my companion had been in activ
servic and he knew better than that he made me ransack the hous for
a flask which he fill with whiski and we line everi avail
pocket with packet of biscuit and slice of meat then we crept out
of the hous and ran as quickli as we could down the illmad road by
which i had come overnight the hous seem desert in the road lai
a group of three char bodi close togeth struck dead by the
heatrai and here and there were thing that peopl had droppeda
clock a slipper a silver spoon and the like poor valuabl at the
corner turn up toward the post offic a littl cart fill with
box and furnitur and horseless heel over on a broken wheel a
cash box had been hastili smash open and thrown under the debri
except the lodg at the orphanag which wa still on fire none of the
hous had suffer veri greatli here the heatrai had shave the
chimnei top and pass yet save ourselv there did not seem to be
a live soul on mayburi hill the major of the inhabit had
escap i suppos by wai of the old woke roadth road i had taken
when i drove to leatherheador thei had hidden
we went down the lane by the bodi of the man in black sodden now from
the overnight hail and broke into the wood at the foot of the hill
we push through these toward the railwai without meet a soul the
wood across the line were but the scar and blacken ruin of
wood for the most part the tree had fallen but a certain proport
still stood dismal grei stem with dark brown foliag instead of
green
on our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer tree it
had fail to secur it foot in on place the woodmen had been at
work on saturdai tree fell and freshli trim lai in a clear
with heap of sawdust by the sawingmachin and it engin hard by wa
a temporari hut desert there wa not a breath of wind thi morn
and everyth wa strang still even the bird were hush and as
we hurri along i and the artilleryman talk in whisper and look
now and again over our shoulder onc or twice we stop to listen
after a time we drew near the road and as we did so we heard the
clatter of hoof and saw through the tree stem three cavalri soldier
ride slowli toward woke we hail them and thei halt while we
hurri toward them it wa a lieuten and a coupl of privat of
the 8th hussar with a stand like a theodolit which the artilleryman
told me wa a heliograph
you ar the first men iv seen come thi wai thi morn said
the lieuten what brew
hi voic and face were eager the men behind him stare curious the
artilleryman jump down the bank into the road and salut
gun destroi last night sir have been hide try to rejoin

no sir and the artilleryman began a vivid account of the heatrai
halfwai through the lieuten interrupt him and look up at me i
wa still stand on the bank by the side of the road
it perfectli true i said
well said the lieuten i suppos it my busi to see it too
look hereto the artillerymanwer detail here clear peopl out

half a mile you sai said he
at most i answer and point over the treetop southward he
thank me and rode on and we saw them no more
farther along we came upon a group of three women and two children in
the road busi clear out a labour cottag thei had got hold of
a littl hand truck and were pile it up with uncleanlook bundl
and shabbi furnitur thei were all too assidu engag to talk to
us as we pass
by byfleet station we emerg from the pine tree and found the
countri calm and peac under the morn sunlight we were far
beyond the rang of the heatrai there and had it not been for the
silent desert of some of the hous the stir movement of
pack in other and the knot of soldier stand on the bridg over
the railwai and stare down the line toward woke the dai would
have seem veri like ani other sundai
sever farm waggon and cart were move creakili along the road to
addleston and suddenli through the gate of a field we saw across a
stretch of flat meadow six twelvepound stand neatli at equal
distanc point toward woke the gunner stood by the gun
wait and the ammunit waggon were at a businesslik distanc
the men stood almost as if under inspect
that good said i thei will get on fair shot at ani rate
the artilleryman hesit at the gate
i shall go on he said
farther on toward weybridg just over the bridg there were a number
of men in white fatigu jacket throw up a long rampart and more
gun behind
it bow and arrow against the lightn anyhow said the
artilleryman thei avent seen that firebeam yet
the offic who were not activ engag stood and stare over the
treetop southwestward and the men dig would stop everi now and
again to stare in the same direct
byfleet wa in a tumult peopl pack and a score of hussar some
of them dismount some on horseback were hunt them about three
or four black govern waggon with cross in white circl and an
old omnibu among other vehicl were be load in the villag
street there were score of peopl most of them suffici
sabbat to have assum their best cloth the soldier were have

or more of flower pot contain orchid angrili expostul with

do you know what over there i said point at the pine top that
hid the martian
eh said he turn i wa explainin these is vallybl

that if he could i hurri on after the artilleryman at the corner i
look back the soldier had left him and he wa still stand by hi
box with the pot of orchid on the lid of it and stare vagu
over the tree
no on in weybridg could tell us where the headquart were
establish the whole place wa in such confus as i had never seen

variat of their sundai experi in the midst of it all the
worthi vicar wa veri pluckili hold an earli celebr and hi
bell wa jangl out abov the excit
i and the artilleryman seat on the step of the drink fountain
made a veri passabl meal upon what we had brought with us patrol of
soldiersher no longer hussar but grenadi in whitewer warn
peopl to move now or to take refug in their cellar as soon as the
fire began we saw as we cross the railwai bridg that a grow
crowd of peopl had assembl in and about the railwai station and the
swarm platform wa pile with box and packag the ordinari
traffic had been stop i believ in order to allow of the passag
of troop and gun to chertsei and i have heard sinc that a savag
struggl occur for place in the special train that were put on at
a later hour
we remain at weybridg until middai and at that hour we found
ourselv at the place near shepperton lock where the wei and thame
join part of the time we spent help two old women to pack a littl
cart the wei ha a trebl mouth and at thi point boat ar to be

wa an inn with a lawn and beyond that the tower of shepperton
churchit ha been replac by a spireros abov the tree
here we found an excit and noisi crowd of fugit as yet the
flight had not grown to a panic but there were alreadi far more peopl
than all the boat go to and fro could enabl to cross peopl came
pant along under heavi burden on husband and wife were even
carri a small outhous door between them with some of their
household good pile thereon on man told us he meant to try to get
awai from shepperton station
there wa a lot of shout and on man wa even jest the idea
peopl seem to have here wa that the martian were simpli formid
human be who might attack and sack the town to be certainli
destroi in the end everi now and then peopl would glanc nervous
across the wei at the meadow toward chertsei but everyth over
there wa still
across the thame except just where the boat land everyth wa
quiet in vivid contrast with the surrei side the peopl who land
there from the boat went tramp off down the lane the big ferryboat
had just made a journei three or four soldier stood on the lawn of
the inn stare and jest at the fugit without offer to
help the inn wa close as it wa now within prohibit hour
what that cri a boatman and shut up you fool said a man
near me to a yelp dog then the sound came again thi time from the
direct of chertsei a muffl thudth sound of a gun
the fight wa begin almost immedi unseen batteri across
the river to our right unseen becaus of the tree took up the
choru fire heavili on after the other a woman scream everyon
stood arrest by the sudden stir of battl near us and yet invis
to us noth wa to be seen save flat meadow cow feed
unconcernedli for the most part and silveri pollard willow motionless
in the warm sunlight
the sojersl stop em said a woman besid me doubtfulli a
hazi rose over the treetop
then suddenli we saw a rush of smoke far awai up the river a puff of
smoke that jerk up into the air and hung and forthwith the ground
heav under foot and a heavi explos shook the air smash two or
three window in the hous near and leav us astonish
here thei ar shout a man in a blue jersei yonder dyer see
them yonder
quickli on after the other on two three four of the armour
martian appear far awai over the littl tree across the flat
meadow that stretch toward chertsei and stride hurriedli toward
the river littl cowl figur thei seem at first go with a
roll motion and as fast as fly bird
then advanc obliqu toward us came a fifth their armour
bodi glitter in the sun as thei swept swiftli forward upon the
gun grow rapidli larger as thei drew nearer on on the extrem
left the remotest that is flourish a huge case high in the air and
the ghostli terribl heatrai i had alreadi seen on fridai night smote
toward chertsei and struck the town
at sight of these strang swift and terribl creatur the crowd near
the water edg seem to me to be for a moment horrorstruck there
wa no scream or shout but a silenc then a hoars murmur and a
movement of feeta splash from the water a man too frighten to
drop the portmanteau he carri on hi shoulder swung round and sent
me stagger with a blow from the corner of hi burden a woman thrust
at me with her hand and rush past me i turn with the rush of the
peopl but i wa not too terrifi for thought the terribl heatrai
wa in my mind to get under water that wa it
get under water i shout unheed
i face about again and rush toward the approach martian rush
right down the gravelli beach and headlong into the water other did
the same a boatload of peopl put back came leap out as i
rush past the stone under my feet were muddi and slipperi and the
river wa so low that i ran perhap twenti feet scarc waistdeep
then as the martian tower overhead scarc a coupl of hundr
yard awai i flung myself forward under the surfac the splash of
the peopl in the boat leap into the river sound like
thunderclap in my ear peopl were land hastili on both side of
the river but the martian machin took no more notic for the moment
of the peopl run thi wai and that than a man would of the
confus of ant in a nest against which hi foot ha kick when
half suffoc i rais my head abov water the martian hood
point at the batteri that were still fire across the river and
as it advanc it swung loos what must have been the gener of the
heatrai
in anoth moment it wa on the bank and in a stride wade halfwai
across the knee of it foremost leg bent at the farther bank and in
anoth moment it had rais itself to it full height again close to
the villag of shepperton forthwith the six gun which unknown to
anyon on the right bank had been hidden behind the outskirt of that
villag fire simultan the sudden near concuss the last
close upon the first made my heart jump the monster wa alreadi
rais the case gener the heatrai as the first shell burst six
yard abov the hood
i gave a cry of astonish i saw and thought noth of the other
four martian monster my attent wa rivet upon the nearer
incid simultan two other shell burst in the air near the
bodi as the hood twist round in time to receiv but not in time to
dodg the fourth shell
the shell burst clean in the face of the thing the hood bulg
flash wa whirl off in a dozen tatter fragment of red flesh and
glitter metal
hit shout i with someth between a scream and a cheer
i heard answer shout from the peopl in the water about me i could
have leap out of the water with that momentari exult
the decapit colossu reel like a drunken giant but it did not
fall over it recov it balanc by a miracl and no longer
heed it step and with the camera that fire the heatrai now
rigidli upheld it reel swiftli upon shepperton the live
intellig the martian within the hood wa slain and splash to
the four wind of heaven and the thing wa now but a mere intric
devic of metal whirl to destruct it drove along in a straight
line incap of guidanc it struck the tower of shepperton church
smash it down as the impact of a batter ram might have done
swerv asid blunder on and collaps with tremend forc into
the river out of my sight
a violent explos shook the air and a spout of water steam mud
and shatter metal shot far up into the sky as the camera of the
heatrai hit the water the latter had immedi flash into steam
in anoth moment a huge wave like a muddi tidal bore but almost
scaldingli hot came sweep round the bend upstream i saw peopl
struggl shoreward and heard their scream and shout faintli
abov the seeth and roar of the martian collaps
for a moment i heed noth of the heat forgot the patent need of
selfpreserv i splash through the tumultu water push
asid a man in black to do so until i could see round the bend half a
dozen desert boat pitch aimlessli upon the confus of the wave
the fallen martian came into sight downstream ly across the river
and for the most part submerg
thick cloud of steam were pour off the wreckag and through the
tumultu whirl wisp i could see intermitt and vagu
the gigant limb churn the water and fling a splash and sprai
of mud and froth into the air the tentacl swai and struck like
live arm and save for the helpless purposeless of these
movement it wa as if some wound thing were struggl for it life
amid the wave enorm quantiti of a ruddybrown fluid were
spurt up in noisi jet out of the machin
my attent wa divert from thi death flurri by a furiou yell
like that of the thing call a siren in our manufactur town a
man kneedeep near the tow path shout inaud to me and
point look back i saw the other martian advanc with gigant
stride down the riverbank from the direct of chertsei the
shepperton gun spoke thi time unavailingli
at that i duck at onc under water and hold my breath until
movement wa an agoni blunder painfulli ahead under the surfac as
long as i could the water wa in a tumult about me and rapidli
grow hotter
when for a moment i rais my head to take breath and throw the hair
and water from my ey the steam wa rise in a whirl white fog
that at first hid the martian altogeth the nois wa deafen
then i saw them dimli coloss figur of grei magnifi by the mist
thei had pass by me and two were stoop over the froth
tumultu ruin of their comrad
the third and fourth stood besid him in the water on perhap two
hundr yard from me the other toward laleham the gener of the
heatrai wave high and the hiss beam smote down thi wai and
that
the air wa full of sound a deafen and confus conflict of
noisesth clangor din of the martian the crash of fall hous
the thud of tree fenc shed flash into flame and the crackl
and roar of fire dens black smoke wa leap up to mingl with
the steam from the river and as the heatrai went to and fro over
weybridg it impact wa mark by flash of incandesc white that
gave place at onc to a smoki danc of lurid flame the nearer hous
still stood intact await their fate shadowi faint and pallid in
the steam with the fire behind them go to and fro
for a moment perhap i stood there breasthigh in the almost boil
water dumbfound at my posit hopeless of escap through the reek
i could see the peopl who had been with me in the river scrambl out
of the water through the reed like littl frog hurri through
grass from the advanc of a man or run to and fro in utter dismai
on the tow path
then suddenli the white flash of the heatrai came leap toward
me the hous cave in as thei dissolv at it touch and dart out
flame the tree chang to fire with a roar the rai flicker up and
down the tow path lick off the peopl who ran thi wai and that
and came down to the water edg not fifti yard from where i stood
it swept across the river to shepperton and the water in it track
rose in a boil weal crest with steam i turn shoreward
in anoth moment the huge wave wellnigh at the boilingpoint had
rush upon me i scream aloud and scald half blind agonis
i stagger through the leap hiss water toward the shore had
my foot stumbl it would have been the end i fell helplessli in
full sight of the martian upon the broad bare gravelli spit that
run down to mark the angl of the wei and thame i expect noth
but death
i have a dim memori of the foot of a martian come down within a score
of yard of my head drive straight into the loos gravel whirl
it thi wai and that and lift again of a long suspens and then of
the four carri the debri of their comrad between them now clear
and then present faint through a veil of smoke reced
intermin as it seem to me across a vast space of river and
meadow and then veri slowli i realis that by a miracl i had

how i fell in with the curat
after get thi sudden lesson in the power of terrestri weapon
the martian retreat to their origin posit upon horsel common
and in their hast and encumb with the debri of their smash
companion thei no doubt overlook mani such a strai and neglig
victim as myself had thei left their comrad and push on forthwith
there wa noth at that time between them and london but batteri of
twelvepound gun and thei would certainli have reach the capit
in advanc of the tide of their approach as sudden dread and
destruct their advent would have been as the earthquak that
destroi lisbon a centuri ago
but thei were in no hurri cylind follow cylind on it
interplanetari flight everi twentyfour hour brought them
reinforc and meanwhil the militari and naval author now
fulli aliv to the tremend power of their antagonist work with
furiou energi everi minut a fresh gun came into posit until
befor twilight everi cops everi row of suburban villa on the hilli
slope about kingston and richmond mask an expect black muzzl
and through the char and desol areaperhap twenti squar mile
altogetherthat encircl the martian encamp on horsel common
through char and ruin villag among the green tree through the
blacken and smoke arcad that had been but a dai ago pine
spinnei crawl the devot scout with the heliograph that were
present to warn the gunner of the martian approach but the martian
now understood our command of artilleri and the danger of human
proxim and not a man ventur within a mile of either cylind
save at the price of hi life
it would seem that these giant spent the earlier part of the afternoon
in go to and fro transfer everyth from the second and third
cylindersth second in addleston golf link and the third at
pyrfordto their origin pit on horsel common over that abov the
blacken heather and ruin build that stretch far and wide
stood on as sentinel while the rest abandon their vast
fightingmachin and descend into the pit thei were hard at work
there far into the night and the tower pillar of dens green smoke
that rose therefrom could be seen from the hill about merrow and
even it is said from banstead and epsom down
and while the martian behind me were thu prepar for their next
salli and in front of me human gather for the battl i made my
wai with infinit pain and labour from the fire and smoke of burn
weybridg toward london
i saw an abandon boat veri small and remot drift downstream
and throw off the most of my sodden cloth i went after it gain
it and so escap out of that destruct there were no oar in the
boat but i contriv to paddl as well as my parboil hand would
allow down the river toward halliford and walton go veri
tedious and continu look behind me as you mai well
understand i follow the river becaus i consid that the water
gave me my best chanc of escap should these giant return
the hot water from the martian overthrow drift downstream with me
so that for the best part of a mile i could see littl of either bank
onc howev i made out a string of black figur hurri across the
meadow from the direct of weybridg halliford it seem wa
desert and sever of the hous face the river were on fire it
wa strang to see the place quit tranquil quit desol under the
hot blue sky with the smoke and littl thread of flame go straight
up into the heat of the afternoon never befor had i seen hous
burn without the accompani of an obstruct crowd a littl
farther on the dry reed up the bank were smoke and glow and a
line of fire inland wa march steadili across a late field of hai
for a long time i drift so pain and weari wa i after the
violenc i had been through and so intens the heat upon the water
then my fear got the better of me again and i resum my paddl
the sun scorch my bare back at last as the bridg at walton wa
come into sight round the bend my fever and faint overcam my
fear and i land on the middlesex bank and lai down deadli sick
amid the long grass i suppos the time wa then about four or five
oclock i got up present walk perhap half a mile without meet
a soul and then lai down again in the shadow of a hedg i seem to
rememb talk wanderingli to myself dure that last spurt i wa
also veri thirsti and bitterli regret i had drunk no more water it
is a curiou thing that i felt angri with my wife i cannot account for
it but my impot desir to reach leatherhead worri me excess
i do not clearli rememb the arriv of the curat so that probabl i
doze i becam awar of him as a seat figur in sootsmudg shirt
sleev and with hi upturn cleanshaven face stare at a faint
flicker that danc over the sky the sky wa what is call a
mackerel skyrow and row of faint downplum of cloud just tint

in london
my younger brother wa in london when the martian fell at woke he
wa a medic student work for an immin examin and he heard
noth of the arriv until saturdai morn the morn paper on
saturdai contain in addit to lengthi special articl on the
planet mar on life in the planet and so forth a brief and vagu
word telegram all the more strike for it breviti
the martian alarm by the approach of a crowd had kill a number
of peopl with a quickfir gun so the stori ran the telegram
conclud with the word formid as thei seem to be the martian
have not move from the pit into which thei have fallen and inde
seem incap of do so probabl thi is due to the rel
strength of the earth gravit energi on that last text their
leaderwrit expand veri comfortingli
of cours all the student in the crammer biologi class to which my
brother went that dai were intens interest but there were no
sign of ani unusu excit in the street the afternoon paper
puf scrap of new under big headlin thei had noth to tell
beyond the movement of troop about the common and the burn of the
pine wood between woke and weybridg until eight then the st
jamess gazett in an extraspeci edit announc the bare fact
of the interrupt of telegraph commun thi wa thought to
be due to the fall of burn pine tree across the line noth
more of the fight wa known that night the night of my drive to
leatherhead and back
my brother felt no anxieti about us as he knew from the descript in
the paper that the cylind wa a good two mile from my hous he
made up hi mind to run down that night to me in order as he sai to
see the thing befor thei were kill he dispatch a telegram which
never reach me about four oclock and spent the even at a music
hall
in london also on saturdai night there wa a thunderstorm and my
brother reach waterloo in a cab on the platform from which the
midnight train usual start he learn after some wait that an
accid prevent train from reach woke that night the natur
of the accid he could not ascertain inde the railwai author
did not clearli know at that time there wa veri littl excit in
the station as the offici fail to realis that anyth further
than a breakdown between byfleet and woke junction had occur were
run the theatr train which usual pass through woke round by
virginia water or guildford thei were busi make the necessari
arrang to alter the rout of the southampton and portsmouth
sundai leagu excurs a nocturn newspap report mistak my
brother for the traffic manag to whom he bear a slight resembl
waylaid and tri to interview him few peopl except the railwai
offici connect the breakdown with the martian
i have read in anoth account of these event that on sundai morn
all london wa electrifi by the new from woke as a matter of
fact there wa noth to justifi that veri extravag phrase plenti
of london did not hear of the martian until the panic of mondai
morn those who did took some time to realis all that the hastili
word telegram in the sundai paper convei the major of peopl
in london do not read sundai paper
the habit of person secur moreov is so deepli fix in the
london mind and startl intellig so much a matter of cours
in the paper that thei could read without ani person tremor
about seven oclock last night the martian came out of the cylind
and move about under an armour of metal shield have complet
wreck woke station with the adjac hous and massacr an
entir battalion of the cardigan regiment no detail ar known maxim
have been absolut useless against their armour the field gun have
been disabl by them fly hussar have been gallop into
chertsei the martian appear to be move slowli toward chertsei or
windsor great anxieti prevail in west surrei and earthwork ar
be thrown up to check the advanc londonward that wa how the
sundai sun put it and a clever and remark prompt handbook
articl in the refere compar the affair to a menageri suddenli
let loos in a villag
no on in london knew posit of the natur of the armour
martian and there wa still a fix idea that these monster must be
sluggish crawl creep painfullysuch express occur in
almost all the earlier report none of the telegram could have been
written by an eyewit of their advanc the sundai paper print
separ edit as further new came to hand some even in default of
it but there wa practic noth more to tell peopl until late in
the afternoon when the author gave the press agenc the new in
their possess it wa state that the peopl of walton and
weybridg and all the district were pour along the road
londonward and that wa all
my brother went to church at the foundl hospit in the morn
still in ignor of what had happen on the previou night there he
heard allus made to the invas and a special prayer for peac
come out he bought a refere he becam alarm at the new in
thi and went again to waterloo station to find out if commun
were restor the omnibus carriag cyclist and innumer
peopl walk in their best cloth seem scarc affect by the
strang intellig that the newsvendor were dissemin peopl
were interest or if alarm alarm onli on account of the local
resid at the station he heard for the first time that the windsor
and chertsei line were now interrupt the porter told him that
sever remark telegram had been receiv in the morn from
byfleet and chertsei station but that these had abruptli ceas my
brother could get veri littl precis detail out of them
there fight go on about weybridg wa the extent of their
inform
the train servic wa now veri much disorganis quit a number of
peopl who had been expect friend from place on the southwestern
network were stand about the station on greyhead old gentleman
came and abus the southwestern compani bitterli to my brother it
want show up he said
on or two train came in from richmond putnei and kingston
contain peopl who had gone out for a dai boat and found the
lock close and a feel of panic in the air a man in a blue and
white blazer address my brother full of strang tide
there host of peopl drive into kingston in trap and cart and
thing with box of valuabl and all that he said thei come from
molesei and weybridg and walton and thei sai there been gun heard
at chertsei heavi fire and that mount soldier have told them to
get off at onc becaus the martian ar come we heard gun fire
at hampton court station but we thought it wa thunder what the
dicken doe it all mean the martian cant get out of their pit can
thei
my brother could not tell him
afterward he found that the vagu feel of alarm had spread to the
client of the underground railwai and that the sundai excursionist
began to return from all over the southwestern lungbarn
wimbledon richmond park kew and so forthat unnatur earli hour
but not a soul had anyth more than vagu hearsai to tell of
everyon connect with the terminu seem illtemp
about five oclock the gather crowd in the station wa immens
excit by the open of the line of commun which is almost
invari close between the southeastern and the southwestern
station and the passag of carriag truck bear huge gun and
carriag cram with soldier these were the gun that were brought
up from woolwich and chatham to cover kingston there wa an exchang
of pleasantri youll get eaten were the beasttam and so
forth a littl while after that a squad of polic came into the
station and began to clear the public off the platform and my brother
went out into the street again
the church bell were ring for evensong and a squad of salvat
armi lassi came sing down waterloo road on the bridg a number of
loafer were watch a curiou brown scum that came drift down the
stream in patch the sun wa just set and the clock tower and
the hous of parliament rose against on of the most peac ski it
is possibl to imagin a sky of gold bar with long transvers
stripe of reddishpurpl cloud there wa talk of a float bodi on

then it wa and then onli that he realis someth of the full
power and terror of these monster he learn that thei were not
mere a hand of small sluggish creatur but that thei were mind
swai vast mechan bodi and that thei could move swiftli and
smite with such power that even the mightiest gun could not stand
against them
thei were describ as vast spiderlik machin nearli a hundr feet

strangest and gravest descript but the public wa exhort to avoid

in the extrem but at the outsid there could not be more than twenti

the author had reason to suppos from the size of the cylind
that at the outsid there could not be more than five in each

xv
what had happen in surrei
it wa while the curat had sat and talk so wildli to me under the
hedg in the flat meadow near halliford and while my brother wa
watch the fugit stream over westminst bridg that the
martian had resum the offens so far as on can ascertain from
the conflict account that have been put forth the major of them
remain busi with prepar in the horsel pit until nine that
night hurri on some oper that disengag huge volum of green
smoke
but three certainli came out about eight oclock and advanc slowli
and cautious made their wai through byfleet and pyrford toward
riplei and weybridg and so came in sight of the expect batteri
against the set sun these martian did not advanc in a bodi but
in a line each perhap a mile and a half from hi nearest fellow thei
commun with on anoth by mean of sirenlik howl run up
and down the scale from on note to anoth
it wa thi howl and fire of the gun at riplei and st georg
hill that we had heard at upper halliford the riplei gunner
unseason artilleri volunt who ought never to have been place in
such a posit fire on wild prematur ineffectu vollei and
bolt on hors and foot through the desert villag while the
martian without us hi heatrai walk seren over their gun
step gingerli among them pass in front of them and so came
unexpectedli upon the gun in painshil park which he destroi
the st georg hill men howev were better led or of a better
mettl hidden by a pine wood as thei were thei seem to have been
quit unsuspect by the martian nearest to them thei laid their gun
as deliber as if thei had been on parad and fire at about a
thousand yard rang
the shell flash all round him and he wa seen to advanc a few
pace stagger and go down everybodi yell togeth and the gun
were reload in frantic hast the overthrown martian set up a
prolong ulul and immedi a second glitter giant
answer him appear over the tree to the south it would seem that
a leg of the tripod had been smash by on of the shell the whole of
the second vollei flew wide of the martian on the ground and
simultan both hi companion brought their heatrai to bear on
the batteri the ammunit blew up the pine tree all about the gun
flash into fire and onli on or two of the men who were alreadi
run over the crest of the hill escap
after thi it would seem that the three took counsel togeth and
halt and the scout who were watch them report that thei remain
absolut stationari for the next half hour the martian who had been
overthrown crawl tedious out of hi hood a small brown figur
oddli suggest from that distanc of a speck of blight and
appar engag in the repair of hi support about nine he had
finish for hi cowl wa then seen abov the tree again
it wa a few minut past nine that night when these three sentinel
were join by four other martian each carri a thick black tube a
similar tube wa hand to each of the three and the seven proceed
to distribut themselv at equal distanc along a curv line between
st georg hill weybridg and the villag of send southwest of
riplei
a dozen rocket sprang out of the hill befor them so soon as thei
began to move and warn the wait batteri about ditton and esher
at the same time four of their fight machin similarli arm with
tube cross the river and two of them black against the western
sky came into sight of myself and the curat as we hurri wearili and
painfulli along the road that run northward out of halliford thei
move as it seem to us upon a cloud for a milki mist cover the
field and rose to a third of their height
at thi sight the curat cri faintli in hi throat and began
run but i knew it wa no good run from a martian and i turn
asid and crawl through dewi nettl and brambl into the broad
ditch by the side of the road he look back saw what i wa do
and turn to join me
the two halt the nearer to us stand and face sunburi the
remot be a grei indistinct toward the even star awai
toward stain
the occasion howl of the martian had ceas thei took up their
posit in the huge crescent about their cylind in absolut
silenc it wa a crescent with twelv mile between it horn never
sinc the devis of gunpowd wa the begin of a battl so still
to us and to an observ about riplei it would have had precis the
same effectth martian seem in solitari possess of the darkl
night lit onli as it wa by the slender moon the star the afterglow
of the daylight and the ruddi glare from st georg hill and the
wood of painshil
but face that crescent everywhereat stain hounslow ditton
esher ockham behind hill and wood south of the river and across
the flat grass meadow to the north of it wherev a cluster of tree
or villag hous gave suffici coverth gun were wait the
signal rocket burst and rain their spark through the night and
vanish and the spirit of all those watch batteri rose to a
tens expect the martian had but to advanc into the line of
fire and instantli those motionless black form of men those gun
glitter so darkli in the earli night would explod into a
thunder furi of battl
no doubt the thought that wa uppermost in a thousand of those vigil
mind even as it wa uppermost in mine wa the riddlehow much thei
understood of us did thei grasp that we in our million were
organ disciplin work togeth or did thei interpret our
spurt of fire the sudden sting of our shell our steadi
invest of their encamp as we should the furiou unanim of
onslaught in a disturb hive of bee did thei dream thei might
extermin us at that time no on knew what food thei need a
hundr such question struggl togeth in my mind as i watch that
vast sentinel shape and in the back of my mind wa the sens of all
the huge unknown and hidden forc londonward had thei prepar
pitfal were the powder mill at hounslow readi as a snare would the
london have the heart and courag to make a greater moscow of their
mighti provinc of hous
then after an intermin time as it seem to us crouch and
peer through the hedg came a sound like the distant concuss of
a gun anoth nearer and then anoth and then the martian besid us
rais hi tube on high and discharg it gunwis with a heavi report
that made the ground heav the on toward stain answer him there
wa no flash no smoke simpli that load deton
i wa so excit by these heavi minutegun follow on anoth that
i so far forgot my person safeti and my scald hand as to clamber
up into the hedg and stare toward sunburi as i did so a second
report follow and a big projectil hurtl overhead toward
hounslow i expect at least to see smoke or fire or some such
evid of it work but all i saw wa the deep blue sky abov with
on solitari star and the white mist spread wide and low beneath
and there had been no crash no answer explos the silenc wa
restor the minut lengthen to three
what ha happen said the curat stand up besid me
heaven know said i
a bat flicker by and vanish a distant tumult of shout began and
ceas i look again at the martian and saw he wa now move
eastward along the riverbank with a swift roll motion
everi moment i expect the fire of some hidden batteri to spring upon
him but the even calm wa unbroken the figur of the martian grew
smaller as he reced and present the mist and the gather night
had swallow him up by a common impuls we clamber higher toward
sunburi wa a dark appear as though a conic hill had suddenli
come into be there hide our view of the farther countri and
then remot across the river over walton we saw anoth such
summit these hilllik form grew lower and broader even as we stare
move by a sudden thought i look northward and there i perceiv a
third of these cloudi black kopj had risen
everyth had suddenli becom veri still far awai to the southeast
mark the quiet we heard the martian hoot to on anoth and
then the air quiver again with the distant thud of their gun but
the earthli artilleri made no repli
now at the time we could not understand these thing but later i wa
to learn the mean of these omin kopj that gather in the
twilight each of the martian stand in the great crescent i have
describ had discharg by mean of the gunlik tube he carri a
huge canist over whatev hill cops cluster of hous or other
possibl cover for gun chanc to be in front of him some fire onli
on of these some twoa in the case of the on we had seen the on
at riplei is said to have discharg no fewer than five at that time
these canist smash on strike the groundthei did not explodeand
incontin disengag an enorm volum of heavi inki vapour
coil and pour upward in a huge and eboni cumulu cloud a gaseou
hill that sank and spread itself slowli over the surround countri
and the touch of that vapour the inhal of it pungent wisp wa
death to all that breath
it wa heavi thi vapour heavier than the densest smoke so that
after the first tumultu uprush and outflow of it impact it sank
down through the air and pour over the ground in a manner rather
liquid than gaseou abandon the hill and stream into the
vallei and ditch and watercours even as i have heard the
carbonicacid ga that pour from volcan cleft is wont to do and
where it came upon water some chemic action occur and the surfac
would be instantli cover with a powderi scum that sank slowli and
made wai for more the scum wa absolut insolubl and it is a
strang thing see the instant effect of the ga that on could
drink without hurt the water from which it had been strain the
vapour did not diffus as a true ga would do it hung togeth in
bank flow sluggishli down the slope of the land and drive
reluctantli befor the wind and veri slowli it combin with the mist
and moistur of the air and sank to the earth in the form of dust
save that an unknown element give a group of four line in the blue
of the spectrum is concern we ar still entir ignor of the
natur of thi substanc
onc the tumultu upheav of it dispers wa over the black
smoke clung so close to the ground even befor it precipit
that fifti feet up in the air on the roof and upper stori of high
hous and on great tree there wa a chanc of escap it poison
altogeth as wa prove even that night at street cobham and ditton
the man who escap at the former place tell a wonder stori of the
strang of it coil flow and how he look down from the church
spire and saw the hous of the villag rise like ghost out of it
inki nothing for a dai and a half he remain there weari
starv and sunscorch the earth under the blue sky and against the
prospect of the distant hill a velvetblack expans with red roof
green tree and later blackveil shrub and gate barn
outhous and wall rise here and there into the sunlight
but that wa at street cobham where the black vapour wa allow to
remain until it sank of it own accord into the ground as a rule the
martian when it had serv it purpos clear the air of it again
by wade into it and direct a jet of steam upon it
thi thei did with the vapour bank near us as we saw in the starlight
from the window of a desert hous at upper halliford whither we had
return from there we could see the searchlight on richmond hill and
kingston hill go to and fro and about eleven the window rattl
and we heard the sound of the huge sieg gun that had been put in
posit there these continu intermitt for the space of a
quarter of an hour send chanc shot at the invis martian at
hampton and ditton and then the pale beam of the electr light
vanish and were replac by a bright red glow
then the fourth cylind fella brilliant green meteora i learn
afterward in bushei park befor the gun on the richmond and
kingston line of hill began there wa a fit cannonad far awai in
the southwest due i believ to gun be fire haphazard befor the
black vapour could overwhelm the gunner
so set about it as method as men might smoke out a wasp
nest the martian spread thi strang stifl vapour over the
londonward countri the horn of the crescent slowli move apart until
at last thei form a line from hanwel to coomb and malden all night
through their destruct tube advanc never onc after the martian
at st georg hill wa brought down did thei give the artilleri the
ghost of a chanc against them wherev there wa a possibl of
gun be laid for them unseen a fresh canist of the black vapour
wa discharg and where the gun were openli displai the heatrai
wa brought to bear
by midnight the blaze tree along the slope of richmond park and the
glare of kingston hill threw their light upon a network of black smoke
blot out the whole vallei of the thame and extend as far as the
ey could reach and through thi two martian slowli wade and turn
their hiss steam jet thi wai and that
thei were spare of the heatrai that night either becaus thei had
but a limit suppli of materi for it product or becaus thei did
not wish to destroi the countri but onli to crush and overaw the
opposit thei had arous in the latter aim thei certainli
succeed sundai night wa the end of the organis opposit to
their movement after that no bodi of men would stand against them so
hopeless wa the enterpris even the crew of the torpedoboat and
destroy that had brought their quickfir up the thame refus to
stop mutini and went down again the onli offens oper men
ventur upon after that night wa the prepar of mine and
pitfal and even in that their energi were frantic and spasmod
on ha to imagin as well as on mai the fate of those batteri
toward esher wait so tens in the twilight survivor there were
none on mai pictur the orderli expect the offic alert and
watch the gunner readi the ammunit pile to hand the limber

on mai pictur too the sudden shift of the attent the swiftli

befor dawn the black vapour wa pour through the street of
richmond and the disintegr organ of govern wa with a
last expir effort rous the popul of london to the necess

xvi
the exodu from london
so you understand the roar wave of fear that swept through the
greatest citi in the world just as mondai wa dawningth stream of
flight rise swiftli to a torrent lash in a foam tumult round
the railwai station bank up into a horribl struggl about the
ship in the thame and hurri by everi avail channel
northward and eastward by ten oclock the polic organis and by
middai even the railwai organis were lose coher lose
shape and effici gutter soften run at last in that
swift liquefact of the social bodi
all the railwai line north of the thame and the southeastern peopl
at cannon street had been warn by midnight on sundai and train were
be fill peopl were fight savag for standingroom in the
carriag even at two oclock by three peopl were be trampl and
crush even in bishopsg street a coupl of hundr yard or more
from liverpool street station revolv were fire peopl stab
and the policemen who had been sent to direct the traffic exhaust
and infuri were break the head of the peopl thei were call
out to protect
and as the dai advanc and the engin driver and stoker refus to
return to london the pressur of the flight drove the peopl in an
everthicken multitud awai from the station and along the
northwardrun road by middai a martian had been seen at barn
and a cloud of slowli sink black vapour drove along the thame and
across the flat of lambeth cut off all escap over the bridg in
it sluggish advanc anoth bank drove over eal and surround a
littl island of survivor on castl hill aliv but unabl to escap
after a fruitless struggl to get aboard a northwestern train at chalk
farmth engin of the train that had load in the good yard there
plough through shriek peopl and a dozen stalwart men fought to
keep the crowd from crush the driver against hi furnacemi brother
emerg upon the chalk farm road dodg across through a hurri
swarm of vehicl and had the luck to be foremost in the sack of a
cycl shop the front tire of the machin he got wa punctur in
drag it through the window but he got up and off notwithstand
with no further injuri than a cut wrist the steep foot of haverstock
hill wa impass ow to sever overturn hors and my brother
struck into belsiz road
so he got out of the furi of the panic and skirt the edgwar road
reach edgwar about seven fast and weari but well ahead of the
crowd along the road peopl were stand in the roadwai curiou
wonder he wa pass by a number of cyclist some horsemen and
two motor car a mile from edgwar the rim of the wheel broke and the
machin becam unrid he left it by the roadsid and trudg
through the villag there were shop half open in the main street of
the place and peopl crowd on the pavement and in the doorwai and
window stare astonish at thi extraordinari process of
fugit that wa begin he succeed in get some food at an
inn
for a time he remain in edgwar not know what next to do the
fly peopl increas in number mani of them like my brother
seem inclin to loiter in the place there wa no fresh new of the
invad from mar
at that time the road wa crowd but as yet far from congest most
of the fugit at that hour were mount on cycl but there were
soon motor car hansom cab and carriag hurri along and the
dust hung in heavi cloud along the road to st alban
it wa perhap a vagu idea of make hi wai to chelmsford where some
friend of hi live that at last induc my brother to strike into a
quiet lane run eastward present he came upon a stile and
cross it follow a footpath northeastward he pass near sever
farmhous and some littl place whose name he did not learn he saw
few fugit until in a grass lane toward high barnet he happen
upon two ladi who becam hi fellow travel he came upon them
just in time to save them
he heard their scream and hurri round the corner saw a coupl of
men struggl to drag them out of the littl ponychais in which thei
had been drive while a third with difficulti held the frighten
poni head on of the ladi a short woman dress in white wa
simpli scream the other a dark slender figur slash at the man
who grip her arm with a whip she held in her disengag hand
my brother immedi grasp the situat shout and hurri
toward the struggl on of the men desist and turn toward him
and my brother realis from hi antagonist face that a fight wa
unavoid and be an expert boxer went into him forthwith and
sent him down against the wheel of the chais
it wa no time for pugilist chivalri and my brother laid him quiet
with a kick and grip the collar of the man who pull at the
slender ladi arm he heard the clatter of hoof the whip stung
across hi face a third antagonist struck him between the ey and
the man he held wrench himself free and made off down the lane in the
direct from which he had come
partli stun he found himself face the man who had held the
hors head and becam awar of the chais reced from him down the
lane swai from side to side and with the women in it look back
the man befor him a burli rough tri to close and he stop him
with a blow in the face then realis that he wa desert he
dodg round and made off down the lane after the chais with the
sturdi man close behind him and the fugit who had turn now
follow remot
suddenli he stumbl and fell hi immedi pursuer went headlong and
he rose to hi feet to find himself with a coupl of antagonist again
he would have had littl chanc against them had not the slender ladi
veri pluckili pull up and return to hi help it seem she had had
a revolv all thi time but it had been under the seat when she and
her companion were attack she fire at six yard distanc narrowli
miss my brother the less courag of the robber made off and
hi companion follow him curs hi cowardic thei both stop in
sight down the lane where the third man lai insens
take thi said the slender ladi and she gave my brother her
revolv
go back to the chais said my brother wipe the blood from hi
split lip
she turn without a wordthei were both pantingand thei went back to
where the ladi in white struggl to hold back the frighten poni
the robber had evid had enough of it when my brother look
again thei were retreat
ill sit here said my brother if i mai and he got upon the empti
front seat the ladi look over her shoulder
give me the rein she said and laid the whip along the poni side
in anoth moment a bend in the road hid the three men from my
brother ey
so quit unexpectedli my brother found himself pant with a cut
mouth a bruis jaw and bloodstain knuckl drive along an
unknown lane with these two women
he learn thei were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeon
live at stanmor who had come in the small hour from a danger
case at pinner and heard at some railwai station on hi wai of the
martian advanc he had hurri home rous the womentheir servant

edgwar with the idea of get a train there he stop behind to
tell the neighbour he would overtak them he said at about half
past four in the morn and now it wa nearli nine and thei had seen
noth of him thei could not stop in edgwar becaus of the grow
traffic through the place and so thei had come into thi side lane
that wa the stori thei told my brother in fragment when present
thei stop again nearer to new barnet he promis to stai with
them at least until thei could determin what to do or until the
miss man arriv and profess to be an expert shot with the
revolvera weapon strang to himin order to give them confid

happi in the hedg he told them of hi own escap out of london and
all that he knew of these martian and their wai the sun crept higher
in the sky and after a time their talk di out and gave place to an
uneasi state of anticip sever wayfar came along the lane
and of these my brother gather such new as he could everi broken
answer he had deepen hi impress of the great disast that had
come on human deepen hi persuas of the immedi necess
for prosecut thi flight he urg the matter upon them
we have monei said the slender woman and hesit
her ey met my brother and her hesit end
so have i said my brother
she explain that thei had as much as thirti pound in gold besid a
fivepound note and suggest that with that thei might get upon a
train at st alban or new barnet my brother thought that wa
hopeless see the furi of the london to crowd upon the train
and broach hi own idea of strike across essex toward harwich and
thenc escap from the countri altogeth
mr elphinstonethat wa the name of the woman in whitewould listen
to no reason and kept call upon georg but her sisterinlaw

brother suggest so design to cross the great north road thei
went on toward barnet my brother lead the poni to save it as much
as possibl as the sun crept up the sky the dai becam excess
hot and under foot a thick whitish sand grew burn and blind so
that thei travel onli veri slowli the hedg were grei with dust
and as thei advanc toward barnet a tumultu murmur grew
stronger
thei began to meet more peopl for the most part these were stare
befor them murmur indistinct question jade haggard unclean
on man in even dress pass them on foot hi ey on the ground
thei heard hi voic and look back at him saw on hand clutch
in hi hair and the other beat invis thing hi paroxysm of
rage over he went on hi wai without onc look back
as my brother parti went on toward the crossroad to the south of
barnet thei saw a woman approach the road across some field on
their left carri a child and with two other children and then
pass a man in dirti black with a thick stick in on hand and a small
portmanteau in the other then round the corner of the lane from
between the villa that guard it at it confluenc with the high

charg there wa food aboard albeit at exorbit price and the
three of them contriv to eat a meal on on of the seat forward
there were alreadi a coupl of score of passeng aboard some of whom
had expend their last monei in secur a passag but the captain
lai off the blackwat until five in the afternoon pick up
passeng until the seat deck were even danger crowd he
would probabl have remain longer had it not been for the sound of
gun that began about that hour in the south as if in answer the
ironclad seaward fire a small gun and hoist a string of flag a jet
of smoke sprang out of her funnel
some of the passeng were of opinion that thi fire came from
shoebury until it wa notic that it wa grow louder at the
same time far awai in the southeast the mast and upperwork of three
ironclad rose on after the other out of the sea beneath cloud of
black smoke but my brother attent speedili revert to the
distant fire in the south he fanci he saw a column of smoke rise
out of the distant grei haze
the littl steamer wa alreadi flap her wai eastward of the big
crescent of ship and the low essex coast wa grow blue and
hazi when a martian appear small and faint in the remot distanc
advanc along the muddi coast from the direct of foul at that
the captain on the bridg swore at the top of hi voic with fear and
anger at hi own delai and the paddl seem infect with hi
terror everi soul aboard stood at the bulwark or on the seat of the
steamer and stare at that distant shape higher than the tree or
church tower inland and advanc with a leisur parodi of a human
stride
it wa the first martian my brother had seen and he stood more amaz
than terrifi watch thi titan advanc deliber toward the
ship wade farther and farther into the water as the coast fell
awai then far awai beyond the crouch came anoth stride over
some stunt tree and then yet anoth still farther off wade
deepli through a shini mudflat that seem to hang halfwai up between
sea and sky thei were all stalk seaward as if to intercept the
escap of the multitudin vessel that were crowd between foul

littl paddleboat and the pour foam that her wheel flung behind
her she reced with terrifi slow from thi omin advanc

by the creep danger awai to the left that he had no ey for

suddenli come round to avoid be run down flung him headlong from
the seat upon which he wa stand there wa a shout all about
him a trampl of feet and a cheer that seem to be answer
faintli the steamboat lurch and roll him over upon hi hand
he sprang to hi feet and saw to starboard and not a hundr yard
from their heel pitch boat a vast iron bulk like the blade of a
plough tear through the water toss it on either side in huge
wave of foam that leap toward the steamer fling her paddl
helplessli in the air and then suck her deck down almost to the

keep hi foot on the heav deck by clutch the bulwark my
brother look past thi charg leviathan at the martian again and
he saw the three of them now close togeth and stand so far out to

sunken and seen in remot perspect thei appear far less
formid than the huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer wa
pitch so helplessli it would seem thei were regard thi new

fire that enabl her to get so near the enemi as she did thei did
not know what to make of her on shell and thei would have sent her
to the bottom forthwith with the heatrai
she wa steam at such a pace that in a minut she seem halfwai
between the steamboat and the martiansa diminish black bulk against
the reced horizont expans of the essex coast
suddenli the foremost martian lower hi tube and discharg a
canist of the black ga at the ironclad it hit her larboard side and
glanc off in an inki jet that roll awai to seaward an unfold
torrent of black smoke from which the ironclad drove clear to the
watcher from the steamer low in the water and with the sun in their
ey it seem as though she were alreadi among the martian
thei saw the gaunt figur separ and rise out of the water as
thei retreat shoreward and on of them rais the cameralik
gener of the heatrai he held it point obliqu downward and
a bank of steam sprang from the water at it touch it must have driven
through the iron of the ship side like a whitehot iron rod through
paper
a flicker of flame went up through the rise steam and then the
martian reel and stagger in anoth moment he wa cut down and a
great bodi of water and steam shot high in the air the gun of the
thunder child sound through the reek go off on after the
other and on shot splash the water high close by the steamer
ricochet toward the other fly ship to the north and smash a
smack to matchwood
but no on heed that veri much at the sight of the martian
collaps the captain on the bridg yell inarticul and all the

i resolv to leav himwould that i had wiser now for the
artilleryman teach i sought out food and drink i had found oil
and rag for my burn and i also took a hat and a flannel shirt that i
found in on of the bedroom when it wa clear to him that i meant to
go alonehad reconcil myself to go aloneh suddenli rous
himself to come and all be quiet throughout the afternoon we
start about five oclock as i should judg along the blacken road
to sunburi
in sunburi and at interv along the road were dead bodi ly in
contort attitud hors as well as men overturn cart and
luggag all cover thickli with black dust that pall of cinderi
powder made me think of what i had read of the destruct of pompeii
we got to hampton court without misadventur our mind full of strang
and unfamiliar appear and at hampton court our ey were reliev
to find a patch of green that had escap the suffoc drift we
went through bushei park with it deer go to and fro under the
chestnut and some men and women hurri in the distanc toward
hampton and so we came to twickenham these were the first peopl we
saw
awai across the road the wood beyond ham and petersham were still
afir twickenham wa uninjur by either heatrai or black smoke and
there were more peopl about here though none could give us new for
the most part thei were like ourselv take advantag of a lull to
shift their quarter i have an impress that mani of the hous here
were still occupi by scare inhabit too frighten even for
flight here too the evid of a hasti rout wa abund along the
road i rememb most vividli three smash bicycl in a heap pound
into the road by the wheel of subsequ cart we cross richmond
bridg about half past eight we hurri across the expos bridg of
cours but i notic float down the stream a number of red mass
some mani feet across i did not know what these werether wa no time
for scrutinyand i put a more horribl interpret on them than thei
deserv here again on the surrei side were black dust that had onc
been smoke and dead bodiesa heap near the approach to the station
but we had no glimps of the martian until we were some wai toward
barn
we saw in the blacken distanc a group of three peopl run down a
side street toward the river but otherwis it seem desert up the
hill richmond town wa burn briskli outsid the town of richmond
there wa no trace of the black smoke
then suddenli as we approach kew came a number of peopl run
and the upperwork of a martian fightingmachin loom in sight over
the housetop not a hundr yard awai from us we stood aghast at our
danger and had the martian look down we must immedi have
perish we were so terrifi that we dare not go on but turn
asid and hid in a shed in a garden there the curat crouch weep
silent and refus to stir again
but my fix idea of reach leatherhead would not let me rest and in
the twilight i ventur out again i went through a shrubberi and
along a passag besid a big hous stand in it own ground and so
emerg upon the road toward kew the curat i left in the shed but
he came hurri after me
that second start wa the most foolhardi thing i ever did for it wa
manifest the martian were about us no sooner had the curat overtaken
me than we saw either the fightingmachin we had seen befor or
anoth far awai across the meadow in the direct of kew lodg
four or five littl black figur hurri befor it across the
greengrei of the field and in a moment it wa evid thi martian
pursu them in three stride he wa among them and thei ran
radiat from hi feet in all direct he us no heatrai to
destroi them but pick them up on by on appar he toss them
into the great metal carrier which project behind him much as a
workman basket hang over hi shoulder
it wa the first time i realis that the martian might have ani other
purpos than destruct with defeat human we stood for a moment
petrifi then turn and fled through a gate behind us into a wall
garden fell into rather than found a fortun ditch and lai there
scarc dare to whisper to each other until the star were out
i suppos it wa nearli eleven oclock befor we gather courag to
start again no longer ventur into the road but sneak along
hedgerow and through plantat and watch keenli through the
dark he on the right and i on the left for the martian who
seem to be all about us in on place we blunder upon a scorch
and blacken area now cool and ashen and a number of scatter
dead bodi of men burn horribl about the head and trunk but with
their leg and boot mostli intact and of dead hors fifti feet
perhap behind a line of four rip gun and smash gun carriag
sheen it seem had escap destruct but the place wa silent and
desert here we happen on no dead though the night wa too dark
for us to see into the side road of the place in sheen my companion
suddenli complain of faint and thirst and we decid to try on
of the hous
the first hous we enter after a littl difficulti with the window
wa a small semidetach villa and i found noth eatabl left in
the place but some mouldi chees there wa howev water to drink
and i took a hatchet which promis to be us in our next
housebreak
we then cross to a place where the road turn toward mortlak here
there stood a white hous within a wall garden and in the pantri of
thi domicil we found a store of foodtwo loav of bread in a pan an
uncook steak and the half of a ham i give thi catalogu so
precis becaus as it happen we were destin to subsist upon
thi store for the next fortnight bottl beer stood under a shelf
and there were two bag of haricot bean and some limp lettuc thi
pantri open into a kind of washup kitchen and in thi wa firewood
there wa also a cupboard in which we found nearli a dozen of
burgundi tin soup and salmon and two tin of biscuit
we sat in the adjac kitchen in the darkfor we dare not strike a
lightand at bread and ham and drank beer out of the same bottl the
curat who wa still timor and restless wa now oddli enough for
push on and i wa urg him to keep up hi strength by eat when
the thing happen that wa to imprison us
it cant be midnight yet i said and then came a blind glare of
vivid green light everyth in the kitchen leap out clearli
visibl in green and black and vanish again and then follow such
a concuss as i have never heard befor or sinc so close on the
heel of thi as to seem instantan came a thud behind me a clash
of glass a crash and rattl of fall masonri all about us and the
plaster of the ceil came down upon us smash into a multitud of
fragment upon our head i wa knock headlong across the floor
against the oven handl and stun i wa insens for a long time
the curat told me and when i came to we were in dark again and
he with a face wet as i found afterward with blood from a cut
forehead wa dab water over me
for some time i could not recollect what had happen then thing came
to me slowli a bruis on my templ assert itself
ar you better ask the curat in a whisper
at last i answer him i sat up
dont move he said the floor is cover with smash crockeri from
the dresser you cant possibl move without make a nois and i
fanci thei ar outsid
we both sat quit silent so that we could scarc hear each other
breath everyth seem deadli still but onc someth near us
some plaster or broken brickwork slid down with a rumbl sound
outsid and veri near wa an intermitt metal rattl
that said the curat when present it happen again
ye i said but what is it
a martian said the curat
i listen again
it wa not like the heatrai i said and for a time i wa inclin
to think on of the great fightingmachin had stumbl against the
hous as i had seen on stumbl against the tower of shepperton
church
our situat wa so strang and incomprehens that for three or
four hour until the dawn came we scarc move and then the light
filter in not through the window which remain black but through
a triangular apertur between a beam and a heap of broken brick in the
wall behind us the interior of the kitchen we now saw greyli for the
first time
the window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould which flow
over the tabl upon which we had been sit and lai about our feet
outsid the soil wa bank high against the hous at the top of the
window frame we could see an uproot drainpip the floor wa litter
with smash hardwar the end of the kitchen toward the hous wa
broken into and sinc the daylight shone in there it wa evid the
greater part of the hous had collaps contrast vividli with thi
ruin wa the neat dresser stain in the fashion pale green and with
a number of copper and tin vessel below it the wallpap imit
blue and white tile and a coupl of colour supplement flutter
from the wall abov the kitchen rang
as the dawn grew clearer we saw through the gap in the wall the bodi
of a martian stand sentinel i suppos over the still glow
cylind at the sight of that we crawl as circumspectli as possibl
out of the twilight of the kitchen into the dark of the sculleri
abruptli the right interpret dawn upon my mind
the fifth cylind i whisper the fifth shot from mar ha
struck thi hous and buri us under the ruin
for a time the curat wa silent and then he whisper
god have merci upon us
i heard him present whimper to himself
save for that sound we lai quit still in the sculleri i for my part
scarc dare breath and sat with my ey fix on the faint light of
the kitchen door i could just see the curat face a dim oval
shape and hi collar and cuff outsid there began a metal
hammer then a violent hoot and then again after a quiet
interv a hiss like the hiss of an engin these nois for
the most part problemat continu intermitt and seem if
anyth to increas in number as time wore on present a measur
thud and a vibrat that made everyth about us quiver and the
vessel in the pantri ring and shift began and continu onc the
light wa eclips and the ghostli kitchen doorwai becam absolut
dark for mani hour we must have crouch there silent and shiver
until our tire attent fail
at last i found myself awak and veri hungri i am inclin to believ
we must have spent the greater portion of a dai befor that awaken
my hunger wa at a stride so insist that it move me to action i
told the curat i wa go to seek food and felt my wai toward the
pantri he made me no answer but so soon as i began eat the faint
nois i made stir him up and i heard him crawl after me
ii
what we saw from the ruin hous
after eat we crept back to the sculleri and there i must have doze
again for when present i look round i wa alon the thud
vibrat continu with wearisom persist i whisper for the
curat sever time and at last felt my wai to the door of the
kitchen it wa still daylight and i perceiv him across the room
ly against the triangular hole that look out upon the martian
hi shoulder were hunch so that hi head wa hidden from me
i could hear a number of nois almost like those in an engin shed
and the place rock with that beat thud through the apertur in
the wall i could see the top of a tree touch with gold and the warm
blue of a tranquil even sky for a minut or so i remain watch
the curat and then i advanc crouch and step with extrem
care amid the broken crockeri that litter the floor
i touch the curat leg and he start so violent that a mass of
plaster went slide down outsid and fell with a loud impact i
grip hi arm fear he might cry out and for a long time we
crouch motionless then i turn to see how much of our rampart
remain the detach of the plaster had left a vertic slit open
in the debri and by rais myself cautious across a beam i wa
abl to see out of thi gap into what had been overnight a quiet
suburban roadwai vast inde wa the chang that we beheld
the fifth cylind must have fallen right into the midst of the hous
we had first visit the build had vanish complet smash
pulveris and dispers by the blow the cylind lai now far beneath
the origin foundationsdeep in a hole alreadi vastli larger than the
pit i had look into at woke the earth all round it had splash
under that tremend impactsplash is the onli wordand lai in
heap pile that hid the mass of the adjac hous it had behav
exactli like mud under the violent blow of a hammer our hous had
collaps backward the front portion even on the ground floor had
been destroi complet by a chanc the kitchen and sculleri had
escap and stood buri now under soil and ruin close in by ton
of earth on everi side save toward the cylind over that aspect we
hung now on the veri edg of the great circular pit the martian were
engag in make the heavi beat sound wa evid just behind
us and ever and again a bright green vapour drove up like a veil
across our peephol
the cylind wa alreadi open in the centr of the pit and on the
farther edg of the pit amid the smash and gravelheap shrubberi
on of the great fightingmachin desert by it occup stood
stiff and tall against the even sky at first i scarc notic the
pit and the cylind although it ha been conveni to describ them
first on account of the extraordinari glitter mechan i saw busi
in the excav and on account of the strang creatur that were
crawl slowli and painfulli across the heap mould near it
the mechan it certainli wa that held my attent first it wa on
of those complic fabric that have sinc been call
handlingmachin and the studi of which ha alreadi given such an
enorm impetu to terrestri invent as it dawn upon me first
it present a sort of metal spider with five joint agil leg
and with an extraordinari number of joint lever bar and reach
and clutch tentacl about it bodi most of it arm were
retract but with three long tentacl it wa fish out a number of
rod plate and bar which line the cover and appar
strengthen the wall of the cylind these as it extract them
were lift out and deposit upon a level surfac of earth behind it
it motion wa so swift complex and perfect that at first i did not
see it as a machin in spite of it metal glitter the
fightingmachin were coordin and anim to an extraordinari
pitch but noth to compar with thi peopl who have never seen
these structur and have onli the illimagin effort of artist or
the imperfect descript of such eyewit as myself to go upon
scarc realis that live qualiti
i recal particularli the illustr of on of the first pamphlet to
give a consecut account of the war the artist had evid made a
hasti studi of on of the fightingmachin and there hi knowledg
end he present them as tilt stiff tripod without either
flexibl or subtleti and with an altogeth mislead monotoni of
effect the pamphlet contain these render had a consider
vogu and i mention them here simpli to warn the reader against the
impress thei mai have creat thei were no more like the martian i
saw in action than a dutch doll is like a human be to my mind the
pamphlet would have been much better without them
at first i sai the handlingmachin did not impress me as a machin
but as a crablik creatur with a glitter integu the
control martian whose delic tentacl actuat it movement
seem to be simpli the equival of the crab cerebr portion but
then i perceiv the resembl of it greybrown shini leatheri
integu to that of the other sprawl bodi beyond and the true
natur of thi dexter workman dawn upon me with that realis
my interest shift to those other creatur the real martian
alreadi i had had a transient impress of these and the first nausea
no longer obscur my observ moreov i wa conceal and
motionless and under no urgenc of action
thei were i now saw the most unearthli creatur it is possibl to
conceiv thei were huge round bodiesor rather headsabout four feet
in diamet each bodi have in front of it a face thi face had no
nostrilsinde the martian do not seem to have had ani sens of
smell but it had a pair of veri larg darkcolour ey and just
beneath thi a kind of fleshi beak in the back of thi head or bodyi
scarc know how to speak of itwa the singl tight tympan surfac
sinc known to be anatom an ear though it must have been almost
useless in our dens air in a group round the mouth were sixteen
slender almost whiplik tentacl arrang in two bunch of eight
each these bunch have sinc been name rather aptli by that
distinguish anatomist professor how the hand even as i saw
these martian for the first time thei seem to be endeavour to
rais themselv on these hand but of cours with the increas
weight of terrestri condit thi wa imposs there is reason
to suppos that on mar thei mai have progress upon them with some
facil
the intern anatomi i mai remark here as dissect ha sinc shown
wa almost equal simpl the greater part of the structur wa the
brain send enorm nerv to the ey ear and tactil tentacl
besid thi were the bulki lung into which the mouth open and the
heart and it vessel the pulmonari distress caus by the denser
atmospher and greater gravit attract wa onli too evid in
the convuls movement of the outer skin
and thi wa the sum of the martian organ strang as it mai seem to a
human be all the complex apparatu of digest which make up the
bulk of our bodi did not exist in the martian thei were
headsmer head entrail thei had none thei did not eat much less
digest instead thei took the fresh live blood of other creatur
and inject it into their own vein i have myself seen thi be
done as i shall mention in it place but squeamish as i mai seem i
cannot bring myself to describ what i could not endur even to
continu watch let it suffic to sai blood obtain from a still
live anim in most case from a human be wa run directli by
mean of a littl pipett into the recipi canal
the bare idea of thi is no doubt horribl repuls to us but at the
same time i think that we should rememb how repuls our carnivor
habit would seem to an intellig rabbit
the physiolog advantag of the practic of inject ar
undeni if on think of the tremend wast of human time and
energi occas by eat and the digest process our bodi ar
half made up of gland and tube and organ occupi in turn
heterogen food into blood the digest process and their
reaction upon the nervou system sap our strength and colour our mind
men go happi or miser as thei have healthi or unhealthi liver or
sound gastric gland but the martian were lift abov all these
organ fluctuat of mood and emot
their undeni prefer for men as their sourc of nourish is
partli explain by the natur of the remain of the victim thei had
brought with them as provis from mar these creatur to judg
from the shrivel remain that have fallen into human hand were
bipe with flimsi silici skeleton almost like those of the
silici spong and feebl musculatur stand about six feet high
and have round erect head and larg ey in flinti socket two or
three of these seem to have been brought in each cylind and all were
kill befor earth wa reach it wa just as well for them for the
mere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have broken everi
bone in their bodi
and while i am engag in thi descript i mai add in thi place
certain further detail which although thei were not all evid to us
at the time will enabl the reader who is unacquaint with them to
form a clearer pictur of these offens creatur
in three other point their physiolog differ strang from our
their organ did not sleep ani more than the heart of man sleep
sinc thei had no extens muscular mechan to recuper that
period extinct wa unknown to them thei had littl or no sens
of fatigu it would seem on earth thei could never have move without
effort yet even to the last thei kept in action in twentyfour hour
thei did twentyfour hour of work as even on earth is perhap the
case with the ant
in the next place wonder as it seem in a sexual world the
martian were absolut without sex and therefor without ani of the
tumultu emot that aris from that differ among men a young
martian there can now be no disput wa realli born upon earth dure
the war and it wa found attach to it parent partial bud
off just as young lilybulb bud off or like the young anim in the
freshwat polyp
in man in all the higher terrestri anim such a method of
increas ha disappear but even on thi earth it wa certainli the
primit method among the lower anim up even to those first
cousin of the vertebr anim the tunic the two process
occur side by side but final the sexual method supersed it
competitor altogeth on mar howev just the revers ha
appar been the case
it is worthi of remark that a certain specul writer of
quasiscientif reput write long befor the martian invas did
forecast for man a final structur not unlik the actual martian
condit hi propheci i rememb appear in novemb or decemb
1893 in a longdefunct public the pall mall budget and i
recal a caricatur of it in a premartian period call punch
he point outwrit in a foolish faceti tonethat the perfect
of mechan applianc must ultim supersed limb the
perfect of chemic devic digest that such organ as hair
extern nose teeth ear and chin were no longer essenti part of
the human be and that the tendenc of natur select would lie
in the direct of their steadi diminut through the come ag
the brain alon remain a cardin necess onli on other part of
the bodi had a strong case for surviv and that wa the hand
teacher and agent of the brain while the rest of the bodi dwindl
the hand would grow larger
there is mani a true word written in jest and here in the martian we
have beyond disput the actual accomplish of such a suppress of
the anim side of the organ by the intellig to me it is quit
credibl that the martian mai be descend from be not unlik
ourselv by a gradual develop of brain and hand the latter
give rise to the two bunch of delic tentacl at last at the
expens of the rest of the bodi without the bodi the brain would of
cours becom a mere selfish intellig without ani of the
emot substratum of the human be
the last salient point in which the system of these creatur differ
from our wa in what on might have thought a veri trivial particular
microorgan which caus so much diseas and pain on earth have
either never appear upon mar or martian sanitari scienc elimin
them ag ago a hundr diseas all the fever and contagion of
human life consumpt cancer tumour and such morbid never
enter the scheme of their life and speak of the differ between
the life on mar and terrestri life i mai allud here to the curiou
suggest of the red weed
appar the veget kingdom in mar instead of have green for a
domin colour is of a vivid bloodr tint at ani rate the seed
which the martian intention or accident brought with them
gave rise in all case to redcolour growth onli that known
popularli as the red weed howev gain ani foot in competit
with terrestri form the red creeper wa quit a transitori growth
and few peopl have seen it grow for a time howev the red weed
grew with astonish vigour and luxuri it spread up the side of
the pit by the third or fourth dai of our imprison and it
cactuslik branch form a carmin fring to the edg of our
triangular window and afterward i found it broadcast throughout the
countri and especi wherev there wa a stream of water
the martian had what appear to have been an auditori organ a singl
round drum at the back of the headbodi and ey with a visual rang
not veri differ from our except that accord to philip blue
and violet were as black to them it is commonli suppos that thei
commun by sound and tentacular gesticul thi is assert
for instanc in the abl but hastili compil pamphlet written
evid by someon not an eyewit of martian action to which i
have alreadi allud and which so far ha been the chief sourc of
inform concern them now no surviv human be saw so much
of the martian in action as i did i take no credit to myself for an
accid but the fact is so and i assert that i watch them close
time after time and that i have seen four five and onc six of
them sluggishli perform the most elabor complic oper
togeth without either sound or gestur their peculiar hoot
invari preced feed it had no modul and wa i believ
in no sens a signal but mere the expir of air preparatori to
the suction oper i have a certain claim to at least an
elementari knowledg of psycholog and in thi matter i am
convinceda firmli as i am convinc of anythingthat the martian
interchang thought without ani physic intermedi and i have
been convinc of thi in spite of strong preconcept befor the
martian invas as an occasion reader here or there mai rememb i
had written with some littl vehem against the telepath theori
the martian wore no cloth their concept of ornament and
decorum were necessarili differ from our and not onli were thei
evid much less sensibl of chang of temperatur than we ar but
chang of pressur do not seem to have affect their health at all
serious yet though thei wore no cloth it wa in the other
artifici addit to their bodili resourc that their great
superior over man lai we men with our bicycl and roadskat
our lilienth soaringmachin our gun and stick and so forth ar
just in the begin of the evolut that the martian have work
out thei have becom practic mere brain wear differ bodi
accord to their need just as men wear suit of cloth and take a
bicycl in a hurri or an umbrella in the wet and of their applianc
perhap noth is more wonder to a man than the curiou fact that
what is the domin featur of almost all human devic in mechan
is absentth wheel is absent among all the thing thei brought to
earth there is no trace or suggest of their us of wheel on would
have at least expect it in locomot and in thi connect it is
curiou to remark that even on thi earth natur ha never hit upon the
wheel or ha prefer other expedi to it develop and not
onli did the martian either not know of which is incred or
abstain from the wheel but in their apparatu singularli littl us
is made of the fix pivot or rel fix pivot with circular
motion thereabout confin to on plane almost all the joint of the
machineri present a complic system of slide part move over
small but beautifulli curv friction bear and while upon thi
matter of detail it is remark that the long leverag of their
machin ar in most case actuat by a sort of sham musculatur of
the disk in an elast sheath these disk becom polaris and drawn
close and powerfulli togeth when travers by a current of
electr in thi wai the curiou parallel to anim motion
which wa so strike and disturb to the human behold wa
attain such quasimuscl abound in the crablik handlingmachin
which on my first peep out of the slit i watch unpack the
cylind it seem infinit more aliv than the actual martian
ly beyond it in the sunset light pant stir ineffectu
tentacl and move feebli after their vast journei across space
while i wa still watch their sluggish motion in the sunlight and
note each strang detail of their form the curat remind me of hi
presenc by pull violent at my arm i turn to a scowl face
and silent eloqu lip he want the slit which permit onli on
of us to peep through and so i had to forego watch them for a time
while he enjoi that privileg
when i look again the busi handlingmachin had alreadi put togeth
sever of the piec of apparatu it had taken out of the cylind
into a shape have an unmistak like to it own and down on
the left a busi littl dig mechan had come into view emit
jet of green vapour and work it wai round the pit excav and
embank in a method and discrimin manner thi it wa which
had caus the regular beat nois and the rhythmic shock that had
kept our ruinou refug quiver it pipe and whistl as it work
so far as i could see the thing wa without a direct martian at
all
iii
the dai of imprison
the arriv of a second fightingmachin drove us from our peephol
into the sculleri for we fear that from hi elev the martian
might see down upon us behind our barrier at a later date we began to
feel less in danger of their ey for to an ey in the dazzl of the
sunlight outsid our refug must have been blank black but at
first the slightest suggest of approach drove us into the sculleri
in heartthrob retreat yet terribl as wa the danger we incur
the attract of peep wa for both of us irresist and i recal
now with a sort of wonder that in spite of the infinit danger in
which we were between starvat and a still more terribl death we
could yet struggl bitterli for that horribl privileg of sight we
would race across the kitchen in a grotesqu wai between eager and
the dread of make a nois and strike each other and thrust and
kick within a few inch of exposur
the fact is that we had absolut incompat disposit and habit
of thought and action and our danger and isol onli accentu
the incompat at halliford i had alreadi come to hate the
curat trick of helpless exclam hi stupid rigid of mind
hi endless mutter monologu vitiat everi effort i made to think
out a line of action and drove me at time thu pent up and
intensifi almost to the verg of crazi he wa as lack in
restraint as a silli woman he would weep for hour togeth and i
verili believ that to the veri end thi spoil child of life thought
hi weak tear in some wai efficaci and i would sit in the dark
unabl to keep my mind off him by reason of hi importun he at
more than i did and it wa in vain i point out that our onli chanc
of life wa to stop in the hous until the martian had done with their
pit that in that long patienc a time might present come when we
should need food he at and drank impuls in heavi meal at long
interv he slept littl
as the dai wore on hi utter careless of ani consider so
intensifi our distress and danger that i had much as i loath do
it to resort to threat and at last to blow that brought him to
reason for a time but he wa on of those weak creatur void of
pride timor anmic hate soul full of shifti cun who
face neither god nor man who face not even themselv
it is disagre for me to recal and write these thing but i set
them down that my stori mai lack noth those who have escap the
dark and terribl aspect of life will find my brutal my flash of
rage in our final tragedi easi enough to blame for thei know what is
wrong as well as ani but not what is possibl to tortur men but
those who have been under the shadow who have gone down at last to
element thing will have a wider chariti
and while within we fought out our dark dim contest of whisper
snatch food and drink and grip hand and blow without in the
pitiless sunlight of that terribl june wa the strang wonder the
unfamiliar routin of the martian in the pit let me return to those
first new experi of mine after a long time i ventur back to the
peephol to find that the newcom had been reinforc by the
occup of no fewer than three of the fightingmachin these last
had brought with them certain fresh applianc that stood in an orderli
manner about the cylind the second handlingmachin wa now
complet and wa busi in serv on of the novel contriv the
big machin had brought thi wa a bodi resembl a milk can in it
gener form abov which oscil a pearshap receptacl and from
which a stream of white powder flow into a circular basin below
the oscillatori motion wa impart to thi by on tentacl of the
handlingmachin with two spatul hand the handlingmachin wa
dig out and fling mass of clai into the pearshap receptacl
abov while with anoth arm it period open a door and remov
rusti and blacken clinker from the middl part of the machin
anoth steeli tentacl direct the powder from the basin along a
rib channel toward some receiv that wa hidden from me by the
mound of bluish dust from thi unseen receiv a littl thread of
green smoke rose vertic into the quiet air as i look the
handlingmachin with a faint and music clink extend
telescop fashion a tentacl that had been a moment befor a mere
blunt project until it end wa hidden behind the mound of clai in
anoth second it had lift a bar of white aluminium into sight
untarnish as yet and shine dazzlingli and deposit it in a
grow stack of bar that stood at the side of the pit between sunset
and starlight thi dexter machin must have made more than a hundr
such bar out of the crude clai and the mound of bluish dust rose
steadili until it top the side of the pit
the contrast between the swift and complex movement of these
contriv and the inert pant clumsi of their master wa
acut and for dai i had to tell myself repeatedli that these latter
were inde the live of the two thing
the curat had possess of the slit when the first men were brought
to the pit i wa sit below huddl up listen with all my
ear he made a sudden movement backward and i fear that we were
observ crouch in a spasm of terror he came slide down the
rubbish and crept besid me in the dark inarticul
gesticul and for a moment i share hi panic hi gestur
suggest a resign of the slit and after a littl while my
curios gave me courag and i rose up step across him and
clamber up to it at first i could see no reason for hi frantic
behaviour the twilight had now come the star were littl and faint
but the pit wa illumin by the flicker green fire that came from
the aluminiummak the whole pictur wa a flicker scheme of
green gleam and shift rusti black shadow strang try to the
ey over and through it all went the bat heed it not at all the
sprawl martian were no longer to be seen the mound of bluegreen
powder had risen to cover them from sight and a fightingmachin with
it leg contract crumpl and abbrevi stood across the corner
of the pit and then amid the clangour of the machineri came a
drift suspicion of human voic that i entertain at first onli to
dismiss
i crouch watch thi fightingmachin close satisfi myself
now for the first time that the hood did inde contain a martian as
the green flame lift i could see the oili gleam of hi integu
and the bright of hi ey and suddenli i heard a yell and saw a
long tentacl reach over the shoulder of the machin to the littl
cage that hunch upon it back then somethingsometh struggl
violentlywa lift high against the sky a black vagu enigma
against the starlight and as thi black object came down again i saw
by the green bright that it wa a man for an instant he wa
clearli visibl he wa a stout ruddi middleag man well dress
three dai befor he must have been walk the world a man of
consider consequ i could see hi stare ey and gleam of
light on hi stud and watch chain he vanish behind the mound and
for a moment there wa silenc and then began a shriek and a
sustain and cheer hoot from the martian
i slid down the rubbish struggl to my feet clap my hand over my
ear and bolt into the sculleri the curat who had been crouch
silent with hi arm over hi head look up as i pass cri out
quit loudli at my desert of him and came run after me
that night as we lurk in the sculleri balanc between our horror
and the terribl fascin thi peep had although i felt an
urgent need of action i tri in vain to conceiv some plan of escap
but afterward dure the second dai i wa abl to consid our
posit with great clear the curat i found wa quit incap
of discuss thi new and culmin atroc had rob him of all
vestig of reason or forethought practic he had alreadi sunk to
the level of an anim but as the sai goe i grip myself with
both hand it grew upon my mind onc i could face the fact that
terribl as our posit wa there wa as yet no justif for
absolut despair our chief chanc lai in the possibl of the
martian make the pit noth more than a temporari encamp or
even if thei kept it perman thei might not consid it necessari
to guard it and a chanc of escap might be afford us i also
weigh veri carefulli the possibl of our dig a wai out in a
direct awai from the pit but the chanc of our emerg within
sight of some sentinel fightingmachin seem at first too great and
i should have had to do all the dig myself the curat would
certainli have fail me
it wa on the third dai if my memori serv me right that i saw the
lad kill it wa the onli occas on which i actual saw the
martian feed after that experi i avoid the hole in the wall for
the better part of a dai i went into the sculleri remov the door
and spent some hour dig with my hatchet as silent as possibl
but when i had made a hole about a coupl of feet deep the loos earth
collaps noisili and i did not dare continu i lost heart and lai
down on the sculleri floor for a long time have no spirit even to
move and after that i abandon altogeth the idea of escap by
excav
it sai much for the impress the martian had made upon me that at
first i entertain littl or no hope of our escap be brought about
by their overthrow through ani human effort but on the fourth or fifth
night i heard a sound like heavi gun
it wa veri late in the night and the moon wa shine brightli the
martian had taken awai the excavatingmachin and save for a
fightingmachin that stood in the remot bank of the pit and a
handlingmachin that wa buri out of my sight in a corner of the pit
immedi beneath my peephol the place wa desert by them except
for the pale glow from the handlingmachin and the bar and patch of
white moonlight the pit wa in dark and except for the clink
of the handlingmachin quit still that night wa a beauti
seren save for on planet the moon seem to have the sky to
herself i heard a dog howl and that familiar sound it wa that
made me listen then i heard quit distinctli a boom exactli like
the sound of great gun six distinct report i count and after a
long interv six again and that wa all
iv
the death of the curat
it wa on the sixth dai of our imprison that i peep for the last
time and present found myself alon instead of keep close to me
and try to oust me from the slit the curat had gone back into the
sculleri i wa struck by a sudden thought i went back quickli and
quietli into the sculleri in the dark i heard the curat drink
i snatch in the dark and my finger caught a bottl of burgundi
for a few minut there wa a tussl the bottl struck the floor and
broke and i desist and rose we stood pant and threaten each
other in the end i plant myself between him and the food and told
him of my determin to begin a disciplin i divid the food in
the pantri into ration to last us ten dai i would not let him eat
ani more that dai in the afternoon he made a feebl effort to get at
the food i had been doze but in an instant i wa awak all dai and
all night we sat face to face i weari but resolut and he weep and
complain of hi immedi hunger it wa i know a night and a dai
but to me it seemedit seem nowan intermin length of time
and so our widen incompat end at last in open conflict for
two vast dai we struggl in underton and wrestl contest there
were time when i beat and kick him madli time when i cajol and
persuad him and onc i tri to bribe him with the last bottl of
burgundi for there wa a rainwat pump from which i could get water
but neither forc nor kind avail he wa inde beyond reason he
would neither desist from hi attack on the food nor from hi noisi
babbl to himself the rudimentari precaut to keep our
imprison endur he would not observ slowli i began to realis
the complet overthrow of hi intellig to perceiv that my sole
companion in thi close and sickli dark wa a man insan
from certain vagu memori i am inclin to think my own mind wander
at time i had strang and hideou dream whenev i slept it sound
paradox but i am inclin to think that the weak and insan
of the curat warn me brace me and kept me a sane man
on the eighth dai he began to talk aloud instead of whisper and
noth i could do would moder hi speech
it is just o god he would sai over and over again it is just on
me and mine be the punish laid we have sin we have fallen
short there wa poverti sorrow the poor were trodden in the dust
and i held my peac i preach accept follymi god what
follywhen i should have stood up though i di for it and call
upon them to repentrep oppressor of the poor and needi
the wine press of god
then he would suddenli revert to the matter of the food i withheld from
him prai beg weep at last threaten he began to rais
hi voicei prai him not to he perceiv a hold on mehe threaten
he would shout and bring the martian upon us for a time that scare
me but ani concess would have shorten our chanc of escap beyond
estim i defi him although i felt no assur that he might
not do thi thing but that dai at ani rate he did not he talk
with hi voic rise slowli through the greater part of the eighth
and ninth daysthreat entreati mingl with a torrent of halfsan
and alwai frothi repent for hi vacant sham of god servic such
as made me piti him then he slept awhil and began again with renew
strength so loudli that i must need make him desist
be still i implor
he rose to hi knee for he had been sit in the dark near the
copper
i have been still too long he said in a tone that must have reach
the pit and now i must bear my wit woe unto thi unfaith
citi woe woe woe woe woe to the inhabit of the earth by
reason of the other voic of the trumpet
shut up i said rise to my feet and in a terror lest the martian
should hear us for god sake
nai shout the curat at the top of hi voic stand likewis
and extend hi arm speak the word of the lord is upon me
in three stride he wa at the door lead into the kitchen
i must bear my wit i go it ha alreadi been too long delai
i put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hang to the wall in a
flash i wa after him i wa fierc with fear befor he wa halfwai
across the kitchen i had overtaken him with on last touch of human
i turn the blade back and struck him with the butt he went headlong
forward and lai stretch on the ground i stumbl over him and stood
pant he lai still
suddenli i heard a nois without the run and smash of slip
plaster and the triangular apertur in the wall wa darken i look
up and saw the lower surfac of a handlingmachin come slowli across
the hole on of it grip limb curl amid the debri anoth
limb appear feel it wai over the fallen beam i stood
petrifi stare then i saw through a sort of glass plate near the
edg of the bodi the face as we mai call it and the larg dark ey
of a martian peer and then a long metal snake of tentacl came
feel slowli through the hole
i turn by an effort stumbl over the curat and stop at the
sculleri door the tentacl wa now some wai two yard or more in the
room and twist and turn with queer sudden movement thi wai
and that for a while i stood fascin by that slow fit advanc
then with a faint hoars cry i forc myself across the sculleri i
trembl violent i could scarc stand upright i open the door
of the coal cellar and stood there in the dark stare at the
faintli lit doorwai into the kitchen and listen had the martian
seen me what wa it do now
someth wa move to and fro there veri quietli everi now and then
it tap against the wall or start on it movement with a faint
metal ring like the movement of kei on a splitr then a
heavi bodyi knew too well whatwa drag across the floor of the
kitchen toward the open irresist attract i crept to the
door and peep into the kitchen in the triangl of bright outer
sunlight i saw the martian in it briareu of a handlingmachin
scrutin the curat head i thought at onc that it would infer
my presenc from the mark of the blow i had given him
i crept back to the coal cellar shut the door and began to cover
myself up as much as i could and as noiselessli as possibl in the
dark among the firewood and coal therein everi now and then i
paus rigid to hear if the martian had thrust it tentacl through
the open again
then the faint metal jingl return i trace it slowli feel
over the kitchen present i heard it nearerin the sculleri as i
judg i thought that it length might be insuffici to reach me i
prai copious it pass scrape faintli across the cellar door
an ag of almost intoler suspens interven then i heard it
fumbl at the latch it had found the door the martian understood
door
it worri at the catch for a minut perhap and then the door
open
in the dark i could just see the thinglik an eleph trunk
more than anyth elsewav toward me and touch and examin
the wall coal wood and ceil it wa like a black worm swai it
blind head to and fro
onc even it touch the heel of my boot i wa on the verg of
scream i bit my hand for a time the tentacl wa silent i could
have fanci it had been withdrawn present with an abrupt click it
grip somethingi thought it had meand seem to go out of the
cellar again for a minut i wa not sure appar it had taken a
lump of coal to examin
i seiz the opportun of slightli shift my posit which had
becom cramp and then listen i whisper passion prayer for
safeti
then i heard the slow deliber sound creep toward me again
slowli slowli it drew near scratch against the wall and tap
the furnitur
while i wa still doubt it rap smartli against the cellar door
and close it i heard it go into the pantri and the biscuittin
rattl and a bottl smash and then came a heavi bump against the
cellar door then silenc that pass into an infin of suspens
had it gone
at last i decid that it had
it came into the sculleri no more but i lai all the tenth dai in the
close dark buri among coal and firewood not dare even to
crawl out for the drink for which i crave it wa the eleventh dai
befor i ventur so far from my secur
v
the still
my first act befor i went into the pantri wa to fasten the door
between the kitchen and the sculleri but the pantri wa empti everi
scrap of food had gone appar the martian had taken it all on the
previou dai at that discoveri i despair for the first time i took
no food or no drink either on the eleventh or the twelfth dai
at first my mouth and throat were parch and my strength eb
sensibl i sat about in the dark of the sculleri in a state of
despond wretched my mind ran on eat i thought i had becom
deaf for the nois of movement i had been accustom to hear from the
pit had ceas absolut i did not feel strong enough to crawl
noiselessli to the peephol or i would have gone there
on the twelfth dai my throat wa so pain that take the chanc of
alarm the martian i attack the creak rainwat pump that
stood by the sink and got a coupl of glass of blacken and
taint rain water i wa greatli refresh by thi and embolden by
the fact that no enquir tentacl follow the nois of my pump
dure these dai in a rambl inconclus wai i thought much of
the curat and of the manner of hi death
on the thirteenth dai i drank some more water and doze and thought
disjointedli of eat and of vagu imposs plan of escap
whenev i doze i dreamt of horribl phantasm of the death of the
curat or of sumptuou dinner but asleep or awak i felt a keen
pain that urg me to drink again and again the light that came into
the sculleri wa no longer grei but red to my disord imagin
it seem the colour of blood
on the fourteenth dai i went into the kitchen and i wa surpris to
find that the frond of the red weed had grown right across the hole in
the wall turn the halflight of the place into a crimsoncolour
obscur
it wa earli on the fifteenth dai that i heard a curiou familiar
sequenc of sound in the kitchen and listen identifi it as the
snuf and scratch of a dog go into the kitchen i saw a dog
nose peer in through a break among the ruddi frond thi greatli
surpris me at the scent of me he bark shortli
i thought if i could induc him to come into the place quietli i should
be abl perhap to kill and eat him and in ani case it would be
advis to kill him lest hi action attract the attent of the
martian
i crept forward sai good dog veri softli but he suddenli
withdrew hi head and disappear
i listenedi wa not deafbut certainli the pit wa still i heard a
sound like the flutter of a bird wing and a hoars croak but
that wa all
for a long while i lai close to the peephol but not dare to move
asid the red plant that obscur it onc or twice i heard a faint
pitterpatt like the feet of the dog go hither and thither on the
sand far below me and there were more birdlik sound but that wa
all at length encourag by the silenc i look out
except in the corner where a multitud of crow hop and fought over
the skeleton of the dead the martian had consum there wa not a
live thing in the pit
i stare about me scarc believ my ey all the machineri had
gone save for the big mound of greyishblu powder in on corner
certain bar of aluminium in anoth the black bird and the
skeleton of the kill the place wa mere an empti circular pit in
the sand
slowli i thrust myself out through the red weed and stood upon the
mound of rubbl i could see in ani direct save behind me to the
north and neither martian nor sign of martian were to be seen the
pit drop sheerli from my feet but a littl wai along the rubbish
afford a practic slope to the summit of the ruin my chanc of
escap had come i began to trembl
i hesit for some time and then in a gust of desper resolut
and with a heart that throb violent i scrambl to the top of the
mound in which i had been buri so long
i look about again to the northward too no martian wa visibl
when i had last seen thi part of sheen in the daylight it had been a
straggl street of comfort white and red hous interspers
with abund shadi tree now i stood on a mound of smash brickwork
clai and gravel over which spread a multitud of red cactusshap
plant kneehigh without a solitari terrestri growth to disput
their foot the tree near me were dead and brown but further a
network of red thread scale the still live stem
the neighbour hous had all been wreck but none had been burn
their wall stood sometim to the second stori with smash window
and shatter door the red weed grew tumultu in their roofless
room below me wa the great pit with the crow struggl for it
refus a number of other bird hop about among the ruin far awai
i saw a gaunt cat slink crouchingli along a wall but trace of men
there were none
the dai seem by contrast with my recent confin dazzlingli
bright the sky a glow blue a gentl breez kept the red weed that
cover everi scrap of unoccupi ground gentli swai and oh the
sweet of the air
vi
the work of fifteen dai
for some time i stood totter on the mound regardless of my safeti
within that noisom den from which i had emerg i had thought with a
narrow intens onli of our immedi secur i had not realis
what had been happen to the world had not anticip thi
startl vision of unfamiliar thing i had expect to see sheen in
ruinsi found about me the landscap weird and lurid of anoth
planet
for that moment i touch an emot beyond the common rang of men
yet on that the poor brute we domin know onli too well i felt as
a rabbit might feel return to hi burrow and suddenli confront by
the work of a dozen busi navvi dig the foundat of a hous i
felt the first inkl of a thing that present grew quit clear in my
mind that oppress me for mani dai a sens of dethron a
persuas that i wa no longer a master but an anim among the
anim under the martian heel with us it would be as with them to
lurk and watch to run and hide the fear and empir of man had pass
awai
but so soon as thi strang had been realis it pass and my
domin motiv becam the hunger of my long and dismal fast in the
direct awai from the pit i saw beyond a redcov wall a patch
of garden ground unburi thi gave me a hint and i went kneedeep
and sometim neckdeep in the red weed the densiti of the weed gave
me a reassur sens of hide the wall wa some six feet high and
when i attempt to clamber it i found i could not lift my feet to the
crest so i went along by the side of it and came to a corner and a
rockwork that enabl me to get to the top and tumbl into the garden
i covet here i found some young onion a coupl of gladiolu bulb
and a quantiti of immatur carrot all of which i secur and
scrambl over a ruin wall went on my wai through scarlet and
crimson tree toward kewit wa like walk through an avenu of
gigant blood dropspossess with two idea to get more food and to
limp as soon and as far as my strength permit out of thi accurs
unearthli region of the pit
some wai farther in a grassi place wa a group of mushroom which
also i devour and then i came upon a brown sheet of flow shallow
water where meadow us to be these fragment of nourish serv
onli to whet my hunger at first i wa surpris at thi flood in a
hot dry summer but afterward i discov that it wa caus by the
tropic exuber of the red weed directli thi extraordinari growth
encount water it straightwai becam gigant and of unparallel
fecund it seed were simpli pour down into the water of the wei
and thame and it swiftli grow and titan water frond speedili
choke both those river
at putnei as i afterward saw the bridg wa almost lost in a tangl
of thi weed and at richmond too the thame water pour in a broad
and shallow stream across the meadow of hampton and twickenham as the
water spread the weed follow them until the ruin villa of the
thame vallei were for a time lost in thi red swamp whose margin i
explor and much of the desol the martian had caus wa
conceal
in the end the red weed succumb almost as quickli as it had spread a
canker diseas due it is believ to the action of certain
bacteria present seiz upon it now by the action of natur
select all terrestri plant have acquir a resist power
against bacteri diseasesthei never succumb without a sever
struggl but the red weed rot like a thing alreadi dead the frond
becam bleach and then shrivel and brittl thei broke off at the
least touch and the water that had stimul their earli growth
carri their last vestig out to sea
my first act on come to thi water wa of cours to slake my
thirst i drank a great deal of it and move by an impuls gnaw
some frond of red weed but thei were wateri and had a sickli
metal tast i found the water wa suffici shallow for me to
wade secur although the red weed imped my feet a littl but the
flood evid got deeper toward the river and i turn back to
mortlak i manag to make out the road by mean of occasion ruin
of it villa and fenc and lamp and so present i got out of thi
spate and made my wai to the hill go up toward roehampton and came
out on putnei common
here the sceneri chang from the strang and unfamiliar to the
wreckag of the familiar patch of ground exhibit the devast
of a cyclon and in a few score yard i would come upon perfectli
undisturb space hous with their blind trimli drawn and door
close as if thei had been left for a dai by the owner or as if
their inhabit slept within the red weed wa less abund the
tall tree along the lane were free from the red creeper i hunt for
food among the tree find noth and i also raid a coupl of
silent hous but thei had alreadi been broken into and ransack i
rest for the remaind of the daylight in a shrubberi be in my
enfeebl condit too fatigu to push on
all thi time i saw no human be and no sign of the martian i
encount a coupl of hungrylook dog but both hurri
circuit awai from the advanc i made them near roehampton i had
seen two human skeletonsnot bodi but skeleton pick cleanand in
the wood by me i found the crush and scatter bone of sever cat
and rabbit and the skull of a sheep but though i gnaw part of
these in my mouth there wa noth to be got from them
after sunset i struggl on along the road toward putnei where i
think the heatrai must have been us for some reason and in the
garden beyond roehampton i got a quantiti of immatur potato
suffici to stai my hunger from thi garden on look down upon
putnei and the river the aspect of the place in the dusk wa
singularli desol blacken tree blacken desol ruin and
down the hill the sheet of the flood river redting with the
weed and over allsil it fill me with indescrib terror to
think how swiftli that desol chang had come
for a time i believ that mankind had been swept out of exist and
that i stood there alon the last man left aliv hard by the top of
putnei hill i came upon anoth skeleton with the arm disloc and
remov sever yard from the rest of the bodi as i proceed i
becam more and more convinc that the extermin of mankind wa
save for such straggler as myself alreadi accomplish in thi part
of the world the martian i thought had gone on and left the countri
desol seek food elsewher perhap even now thei were
destroi berlin or pari or it might be thei had gone northward
vii
the man on putnei hill
i spent that night in the inn that stand at the top of putnei hill
sleep in a made bed for the first time sinc my flight to
leatherhead i will not tell the needless troubl i had break into
that houseafterward i found the front door wa on the latchnor how i
ransack everi room for food until just on the verg of despair in
what seem to me to be a servant bedroom i found a ratgnaw crust
and two tin of pineappl the place had been alreadi search and
empti in the bar i afterward found some biscuit and sandwich
that had been overlook the latter i could not eat thei were too
rotten but the former not onli stai my hunger but fill my
pocket i lit no lamp fear some martian might come beat that
part of london for food in the night befor i went to bed i had an
interv of restless and prowl from window to window peer
out for some sign of these monster i slept littl as i lai in bed i
found myself think consecutivelya thing i do not rememb to have
done sinc my last argument with the curat dure all the interven
time my mental condit had been a hurri success of vagu
emot state or a sort of stupid recept but in the night my
brain reinforc i suppos by the food i had eaten grew clear
again and i thought
three thing struggl for possess of my mind the kill of the
curat the whereabout of the martian and the possibl fate of my
wife the former gave me no sensat of horror or remors to recal i
saw it simpli as a thing done a memori infinit disagre but
quit without the qualiti of remors i saw myself then as i see myself
now driven step by step toward that hasti blow the creatur of a
sequenc of accid lead inevit to that i felt no
condemn yet the memori static unprogress haunt me in the
silenc of the night with that sens of the near of god that
sometim come into the still and the dark i stood my trial
my onli trial for that moment of wrath and fear i retrac everi step
of our convers from the moment when i had found him crouch
besid me heedless of my thirst and point to the fire and smoke
that stream up from the ruin of weybridg we had been incap of
cooperationgrim chanc had taken no heed of that had i foreseen i
should have left him at halliford but i did not forese and crime is
to forese and do and i set thi down as i have set all thi stori
down as it wa there were no witnessesal these thing i might have
conceal but i set it down and the reader must form hi judgment as
he will
and when by an effort i had set asid that pictur of a prostrat
bodi i face the problem of the martian and the fate of my wife for
the former i had no data i could imagin a hundr thing and so
unhappili i could for the latter and suddenli that night becam
terribl i found myself sit up in bed stare at the dark i
found myself prai that the heatrai might have suddenli and
painlessli struck her out of be sinc the night of my return from
leatherhead i had not prai i had utter prayer fetish prayer
had prai as heathen mutter charm when i wa in extrem but now i
prai inde plead steadfastli and sane face to face with the
dark of god strang night strangest in thi that so soon as dawn
had come i who had talk with god crept out of the hous like a rat
leav it hide placea creatur scarc larger an inferior
anim a thing that for ani pass whim of our master might be
hunt and kill perhap thei also prai confid to god sure
if we have learn noth els thi war ha taught us pityp for
those witless soul that suffer our dominion
the morn wa bright and fine and the eastern sky glow pink and
wa fret with littl golden cloud in the road that run from the
top of putnei hill to wimbledon wa a number of poor vestig of the
panic torrent that must have pour londonward on the sundai night
after the fight began there wa a littl twowheel cart inscrib
with the name of thoma lobb greengroc new malden with a smash
wheel and an abandon tin trunk there wa a straw hat trampl into
the now harden mud and at the top of west hill a lot of
bloodstain glass about the overturn water trough my movement
were languid my plan of the vaguest i had an idea of go to
leatherhead though i knew that there i had the poorest chanc of
find my wife certainli unless death had overtaken them suddenli
my cousin and she would have fled thenc but it seem to me i might
find or learn there whither the surrei peopl had fled i knew i want
to find my wife that my heart ach for her and the world of men but
i had no clear idea how the find might be done i wa also sharpli
awar now of my intens loneli from the corner i went under cover
of a thicket of tree and bush to the edg of wimbledon common
stretch wide and far
that dark expans wa lit in patch by yellow gors and broom there
wa no red weed to be seen and as i prowl hesit on the verg
of the open the sun rose flood it all with light and vital i
came upon a busi swarm of littl frog in a swampi place among the
tree i stop to look at them draw a lesson from their stout
resolv to live and present turn suddenli with an odd feel
of be watch i beheld someth crouch amid a clump of bush
i stood regard thi i made a step toward it and it rose up and
becam a man arm with a cutlass i approach him slowli he stood
silent and motionless regard me
as i drew nearer i perceiv he wa dress in cloth as dusti and
filthi as my own he look inde as though he had been drag
through a culvert nearer i distinguish the green slime of ditch
mix with the pale drab of dri clai and shini coali patch hi
black hair fell over hi ey and hi face wa dark and dirti and
sunken so that at first i did not recognis him there wa a red cut
across the lower part of hi face
stop he cri when i wa within ten yard of him and i stop

i think ought to be done the tame on will go like all tame beast
in a few gener theyll be big beauti richblood
stupidrubbish the risk is that we who keep wild will go
savagedegener into a sort of big savag rat you see how i
mean to live is underground iv been think about the drain of

thi london ar mile and mileshundr of milesand a few dai rain
and london empti will leav them sweet and clean the main drain ar
big enough and airi enough for anyon then there cellar vault

useless and cumbersom and mischiev have to die thei ought to die
thei ought to be will to die it a sort of disloyalti after all
to live and taint the race and thei cant be happi moreov dy
none so dread it the funk make it bad and in all those
place we shall gather our district will be london and we mai even be
abl to keep a watch and run about in the open when the martian keep
awai plai cricket perhap that how we shall save the race eh
it a possibl thing but save the race is noth in itself as i
sai that onli be rat it save our knowledg and ad to it
is the thing there men like you come in there book there
model we must make great safe place down deep and get all the book
we can not novel and poetri swipe but idea scienc book that
where men like you come in we must go to the british museum and pick
all those book through especi we must keep up our sciencelearn
more we must watch these martian some of us must go as spi when
it all work perhap i will get caught i mean and the great
thing is we must leav the martian alon we mustnt even steal if
we get in their wai we clear out we must show them we mean no harm
ye i know but theyr intellig thing and thei wont hunt us
down if thei have all thei want and think were just harmless vermin
the artilleryman paus and laid a brown hand upon my arm
after all it mai not be so much we mai have to learn beforejust
imagin thi four or five of their fight machin suddenli start
offheatrai right and left and not a martian in em not a martian
in em but menmen who have learn the wai how it mai be in my time
eventhos men fanci have on of them love thing with it
heatrai wide and free fanci have it in control what would it
matter if you smash to smithereen at the end of the run after a
bust like that i reckon the martiansl open their beauti ey
cant you see them man cant you see them hurri hurryingpuf
and blow and hoot to their other mechan affair someth
out of gear in everi case and swish bang rattl swish just as thei
ar fumbl over it swish come the heatrai and behold man ha
come back to hi own
for a while the imagin dare of the artilleryman and the tone of
assur and courag he assum complet domin my mind i
believ unhesitatingli both in hi forecast of human destini and in
the practic of hi astonish scheme and the reader who think
me suscept and foolish must contrast hi posit read steadili
with all hi thought about hi subject and mine crouch fearfulli
in the bush and listen distract by apprehens we talk in
thi manner through the earli morn time and later crept out of the
bush and after scan the sky for martian hurri precipit
to the hous on putnei hill where he had made hi lair it wa the coal
cellar of the place and when i saw the work he had spent a week
uponit wa a burrow scarc ten yard long which he design to
reach to the main drain on putnei hilli had my first inkl of the
gulf between hi dream and hi power such a hole i could have dug in
a dai but i believ in him suffici to work with him all that
morn until past middai at hi dig we had a garden barrow and
shot the earth we remov against the kitchen rang we refresh
ourselv with a tin of mockturtl soup and wine from the neighbour
pantri i found a curiou relief from the ach strang of the
world in thi steadi labour as we work i turn hi project over in
my mind and present object and doubt began to aris but i
work there all the morn so glad wa i to find myself with a
purpos again after work an hour i began to specul on the
distanc on had to go befor the cloaca wa reach the chanc we
had of miss it altogeth my immedi troubl wa why we should
dig thi long tunnel when it wa possibl to get into the drain at
onc down on of the manhol and work back to the hous it seem to
me too that the hous wa inconveni chosen and requir a
needless length of tunnel and just as i wa begin to face these
thing the artilleryman stop dig and look at me
were work well he said he put down hi spade let us knock off
a bit he said i think it time we reconnoitr from the roof of the
hous
i wa for go on and after a littl hesit he resum hi spade
and then suddenli i wa struck by a thought i stop and so did he
at onc
why were you walk about the common i said instead of be
here
take the air he said i wa come back it safer by night
but the work
oh on cant alwai work he said and in a flash i saw the man
plain he hesit hold hi spade we ought to reconnoitr now
he said becaus if ani come near thei mai hear the spade and drop
upon us unawar
i wa no longer dispos to object we went togeth to the roof and
stood on a ladder peep out of the roof door no martian were to be
seen and we ventur out on the tile and slip down under shelter
of the parapet
from thi posit a shrubberi hid the greater portion of putnei but
we could see the river below a bubbl mass of red weed and the low
part of lambeth flood and red the red creeper swarm up the tree
about the old palac and their branch stretch gaunt and dead and
set with shrivel leav from amid it cluster it wa strang how
entir depend both these thing were upon flow water for their
propag about us neither had gain a foot laburnum pink
mai snowbal and tree of arborvita rose out of laurel and
hydrangea green and brilliant into the sunlight beyond kensington
dens smoke wa rise and that and a blue haze hid the northward
hill
the artilleryman began to tell me of the sort of peopl who still
remain in london
on night last week he said some fool got the electr light in
order and there wa all regent street and the circu ablaz crowd
with paint and rag drunkard men and women danc and shout
till dawn a man who wa there told me and as the dai came thei becam
awar of a fightingmachin stand near by the langham and look
down at them heaven know how long he had been there it must have
given some of them a nasti turn he came down the road toward them
and pick up nearli a hundr too drunk or frighten to run awai
grotesqu gleam of a time no histori will ever fulli describ
from that in answer to my question he came round to hi grandios
plan again he grew enthusiast he talk so eloqu of the
possibl of captur a fightingmachin that i more than half
believ in him again but now that i wa begin to understand
someth of hi qualiti i could divin the stress he laid on do
noth precipit and i note that now there wa no question that
he person wa to captur and fight the great machin
after a time we went down to the cellar neither of us seem dispos
to resum dig and when he suggest a meal i wa noth loath
he becam suddenli veri gener and when we had eaten he went awai
and return with some excel cigar we lit these and hi optim
glow he wa inclin to regard my come as a great occas
there some champagn in the cellar he said
we can dig better on thi thamessid burgundi said i
no said he i am host todai champagn great god weve a heavi
enough task befor us let us take a rest and gather strength while we
mai look at these blister hand
and pursuant to thi idea of a holidai he insist upon plai card
after we had eaten he taught me euchr and after divid london
between us i take the northern side and he the southern we plai
for parish point grotesqu and foolish as thi will seem to the sober
reader it is absolut true and what is more remark i found the
card game and sever other we plai extrem interest
strang mind of man that with our speci upon the edg of
extermin or appal degrad with no clear prospect befor
us but the chanc of a horribl death we could sit follow the
chanc of thi paint pasteboard and plai the joker with vivid
delight afterward he taught me poker and i beat him at three tough
chess game when dark came we decid to take the risk and lit a
lamp
after an intermin string of game we sup and the artilleryman
finish the champagn we went on smoke the cigar he wa no longer
the energet regener of hi speci i had encount in the
morn he wa still optimist but it wa a less kinet a more
thought optim i rememb he wound up with my health propos in
a speech of small varieti and consider intermitt i took a
cigar and went upstair to look at the light of which he had spoken
that blaze so greenli along the highgat hill
at first i stare unintellig across the london vallei the
northern hill were shroud in dark the fire near kensington
glow redli and now and then an orang tongu of flame flash up
and vanish in the deep blue night all the rest of london wa black
then nearer i perceiv a strang light a pale violetpurpl
fluoresc glow quiver under the night breez for a space i could
not understand it and then i knew that it must be the red weed from
which thi faint irradi proceed with that realis my
dormant sens of wonder my sens of the proport of thing awok
again i glanc from that to mar red and clear glow high in the
west and then gaze long and earnestli at the dark of hampstead
and highgat
i remain a veri long time upon the roof wonder at the grotesqu
chang of the dai i recal my mental state from the midnight
prayer to the foolish cardplai i had a violent revuls of
feel i rememb i flung awai the cigar with a certain wast
symbol my folli came to me with glare exagger i seem a
traitor to my wife and to my kind i wa fill with remors i
resolv to leav thi strang undisciplin dreamer of great thing to
hi drink and gluttoni and to go on into london there it seem to
me i had the best chanc of learn what the martian and my
fellowmen were do i wa still upon the roof when the late moon
rose
viii
dead london
after i had part from the artilleryman i went down the hill and by
the high street across the bridg to fulham the red weed wa
tumultu at that time and nearli choke the bridg roadwai but it
frond were alreadi whiten in patch by the spread diseas that
present remov it so swiftli
at the corner of the lane that run to putnei bridg station i found a
man ly he wa as black as a sweep with the black dust aliv but
helplessli and speechlessli drunk i could get noth from him but
curs and furiou lung at my head i think i should have stai by
him but for the brutal express of hi face
there wa black dust along the roadwai from the bridg onward and it
grew thicker in fulham the street were horribl quiet i got
foodsour hard and mouldi but quit eatablein a baker shop here
some wai toward walham green the street becam clear of powder and i
pass a white terrac of hous on fire the nois of the burn wa
an absolut relief go on toward brompton the street were quiet
again
here i came onc more upon the black powder in the street and upon
dead bodi i saw altogeth about a dozen in the length of the fulham
road thei had been dead mani dai so that i hurri quickli past
them the black powder cover them over and soften their outlin
on or two had been disturb by dog
where there wa no black powder it wa curious like a sundai in the
citi with the close shop the hous lock up and the blind drawn
the desert and the still in some place plunder had been at
work but rare at other than the provis and wine shop a
jewel window had been broken open in on place but appar the
thief had been disturb and a number of gold chain and a watch lai
scatter on the pavement i did not troubl to touch them farther on
wa a tatter woman in a heap on a doorstep the hand that hung over
her knee wa gash and bled down her rusti brown dress and a smash
magnum of champagn form a pool across the pavement she seem
asleep but she wa dead
the farther i penetr into london the profound grew the
still but it wa not so much the still of deathit wa the
still of suspens of expect at ani time the destruct that
had alreadi sing the northwestern border of the metropoli and had
annihil eal and kilburn might strike among these hous and
leav them smoke ruin it wa a citi condemn and derelict
in south kensington the street were clear of dead and of black powder
it wa near south kensington that i first heard the howl it crept
almost impercept upon my sens it wa a sob altern of
two note ulla ulla ulla ulla keep on perpetu when i
pass street that ran northward it grew in volum and hous and
build seem to deaden and cut it off again it came in a full tide
down exhibit road i stop stare toward kensington garden
wonder at thi strang remot wail it wa as if that mighti
desert of hous had found a voic for it fear and solitud
ulla ulla ulla ulla wail that superhuman notegreat wave of
sound sweep down the broad sunlit roadwai between the tall
build on each side i turn northward marvel toward the
iron gate of hyde park i had half a mind to break into the natur
histori museum and find my wai up to the summit of the tower in
order to see across the park but i decid to keep to the ground
where quick hide wa possibl and so went on up the exhibit road
all the larg mansion on each side of the road were empti and still
and my footstep echo against the side of the hous at the top
near the park gate i came upon a strang sighta bu overturn and
the skeleton of a hors pick clean i puzzl over thi for a time
and then went on to the bridg over the serpentin the voic grew
stronger and stronger though i could see noth abov the housetop
on the north side of the park save a haze of smoke to the northwest
ulla ulla ulla ulla cri the voic come as it seem to me
from the district about regent park the desol cry work upon
my mind the mood that had sustain me pass the wail took
possess of me i found i wa intens weari footsor and now
again hungri and thirsti
it wa alreadi past noon why wa i wander alon in thi citi of the
dead why wa i alon when all london wa ly in state and in it
black shroud i felt intoler lone my mind ran on old friend
that i had forgotten for year i thought of the poison in the
chemist shop of the liquor the wine merchant store i recal
the two sodden creatur of despair who so far as i knew share the
citi with myself
i came into oxford street by the marbl arch and here again were black
powder and sever bodi and an evil omin smell from the grate
of the cellar of some of the hous i grew veri thirsti after the
heat of my long walk with infinit troubl i manag to break into a
publichous and get food and drink i wa weari after eat and went
into the parlour behind the bar and slept on a black horsehair sofa i
found there
i awok to find that dismal howl still in my ear ulla ulla
ulla ulla it wa now dusk and after i had rout out some biscuit
and a chees in the barther wa a meat safe but it contain noth
but maggotsi wander on through the silent residenti squar to
baker streetportman squar is the onli on i can nameand so came out
at last upon regent park and as i emerg from the top of baker
street i saw far awai over the tree in the clear of the sunset
the hood of the martian giant from which thi howl proceed i wa
not terrifi i came upon him as if it were a matter of cours i
watch him for some time but he did not move he appear to be
stand and yell for no reason that i could discov
i tri to formul a plan of action that perpetu sound of ulla
ulla ulla ulla confus my mind perhap i wa too tire to be veri
fear certainli i wa more curiou to know the reason of thi
monoton cry than afraid i turn back awai from the park and
struck into park road intend to skirt the park went along under
the shelter of the terrac and got a view of thi stationari howl
martian from the direct of st john wood a coupl of hundr
yard out of baker street i heard a yelp choru and saw first a
dog with a piec of putresc red meat in hi jaw come headlong
toward me and then a pack of starv mongrel in pursuit of him he
made a wide curv to avoid me as though he fear i might prove a
fresh competitor as the yelp di awai down the silent road the
wail sound of ulla ulla ulla ulla reassert itself
i came upon the wreck handlingmachin halfwai to st john wood
station at first i thought a hous had fallen across the road it wa
onli as i clamber among the ruin that i saw with a start thi
mechan samson ly with it tentacl bent and smash and
twist among the ruin it had made the forepart wa shatter it
seem as if it had driven blindli straight at the hous and had been
overwhelm in it overthrow it seem to me then that thi might have
happen by a handlingmachin escap from the guidanc of it
martian i could not clamber among the ruin to see it and the
twilight wa now so far advanc that the blood with which it seat wa
smear and the gnaw gristl of the martian that the dog had left
were invis to me
wonder still more at all that i had seen i push on toward
primros hill far awai through a gap in the tree i saw a second
martian as motionless as the first stand in the park toward the
zoolog garden and silent a littl beyond the ruin about the
smash handlingmachin i came upon the red weed again and found the
regent canal a spongi mass of darkr veget
as i cross the bridg the sound of ulla ulla ulla ulla ceas
it wa as it were cut off the silenc came like a thunderclap
the duski hous about me stood faint and tall and dim the tree
toward the park were grow black all about me the red weed
clamber among the ruin writh to get abov me in the dim
night the mother of fear and mysteri wa come upon me but while
that voic sound the solitud the desol had been endur by
virtu of it london had still seem aliv and the sens of life about
me had upheld me then suddenli a chang the pass of somethingi
knew not whatand then a still that could be felt noth but thi
gaunt quiet
london about me gaze at me spectral the window in the white hous
were like the ey socket of skull about me my imagin found a
thousand noiseless enemi move terror seiz me a horror of my
temer in front of me the road becam pitchi black as though it wa
tar and i saw a contort shape ly across the pathwai i could
not bring myself to go on i turn down st john wood road and ran
headlong from thi unendur still toward kilburn i hid from
the night and the silenc until long after midnight in a cabmen
shelter in harrow road but befor the dawn my courag return and
while the star were still in the sky i turn onc more toward
regent park i miss my wai among the street and present saw
down a long avenu in the halflight of the earli dawn the curv of
primros hill on the summit tower up to the fade star wa a
third martian erect and motionless like the other
an insan resolv possess me i would die and end it and i would
save myself even the troubl of kill myself i march on recklessli
toward thi titan and then as i drew nearer and the light grew i
saw that a multitud of black bird wa circl and cluster about
the hood at that my heart gave a bound and i began run along the
road
i hurri through the red weed that choke st edmund terrac i
wade breasthigh across a torrent of water that wa rush down from
the waterwork toward the albert road and emerg upon the grass
befor the rise of the sun great mound had been heap about the
crest of the hill make a huge redoubt of itit wa the final and
largest place the martian had madeand from behind these heap there
rose a thin smoke against the sky against the sky line an eager dog
ran and disappear the thought that had flash into my mind grew
real grew credibl i felt no fear onli a wild trembl exult
as i ran up the hill toward the motionless monster out of the hood
hung lank shred of brown at which the hungri bird peck and tore
in anoth moment i had scrambl up the earthen rampart and stood upon
it crest and the interior of the redoubt wa below me a mighti space
it wa with gigant machin here and there within it huge mound of
materi and strang shelter place and scatter about it some in
their overturn warmachin some in the now rigid handlingmachin
and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a row were the
martiansdeadslain by the putrefact and diseas bacteria against
which their system were unprepar slain as the red weed wa be
slain slain after all man devic had fail by the humblest
thing that god in hi wisdom ha put upon thi earth
for so it had come about as inde i and mani men might have foreseen
had not terror and disast blind our mind these germ of diseas
have taken toll of human sinc the begin of thingstaken toll of
our prehuman ancestor sinc life began here but by virtu of thi
natur select of our kind we have develop resist power to no
germ do we succumb without a struggl and to manythos that caus
putrefact in dead matter for instanceour live frame ar
altogeth immun but there ar no bacteria in mar and directli
these invad arriv directli thei drank and fed our microscop
alli began to work their overthrow alreadi when i watch them thei
were irrevoc doom dy and rot even as thei went to and
fro it wa inevit by the toll of a billion death man ha bought
hi birthright of the earth and it is hi against all comer it would
still be hi were the martian ten time as mighti as thei ar for
neither do men live nor die in vain
here and there thei were scatter nearli fifti altogeth in that
great gulf thei had made overtaken by a death that must have seem to
them as incomprehens as ani death could be to me also at that time
thi death wa incomprehens all i knew wa that these thing that
had been aliv and so terribl to men were dead for a moment i
believ that the destruct of sennacherib had been repeat that
god had repent that the angel of death had slain them in the night
i stood stare into the pit and my heart lighten glorious even
as the rise sun struck the world to fire about me with hi rai the
pit wa still in dark the mighti engin so great and wonder
in their power and complex so unearthli in their tortuou form
rose weird and vagu and strang out of the shadow toward the light
a multitud of dog i could hear fought over the bodi that lai
darkli in the depth of the pit far below me across the pit on it
farther lip flat and vast and strang lai the great flyingmachin
with which thei had been experi upon our denser atmospher when
decai and death arrest them death had come not a dai too soon at
the sound of a caw overhead i look up at the huge fightingmachin
that would fight no more for ever at the tatter red shred of flesh
that drip down upon the overturn seat on the summit of primros
hill
i turn and look down the slope of the hill to where enhalo now
in bird stood those other two martian that i had seen overnight
just as death had overtaken them the on had di even as it had been
cry to it companion perhap it wa the last to die and it voic
had gone on perpetu until the forc of it machineri wa exhaust
thei glitter now harmless tripod tower of shine metal in the
bright of the rise sun
all about the pit and save as by a miracl from everlast
destruct stretch the great mother of citi those who have onli
seen london veil in her sombr robe of smoke can scarc imagin
the nake clear and beauti of the silent wilder of hous
eastward over the blacken ruin of the albert terrac and the
splinter spire of the church the sun blaze dazzl in a clear sky
and here and there some facet in the great wilder of roof caught
the light and glare with a white intens
northward were kilburn and hampst blue and crowd with hous
westward the great citi wa dim and southward beyond the martian
the green wave of regent park the langham hotel the dome of the
albert hall the imperi institut and the giant mansion of the
brompton road came out clear and littl in the sunris the jag
ruin of westminst rise hazili beyond far awai and blue were the
surrei hill and the tower of the crystal palac glitter like two
silver rod the dome of st paul wa dark against the sunris and
injur i saw for the first time by a huge gape caviti on it
western side
and as i look at thi wide expans of hous and factori and
church silent and abandon as i thought of the multitudin hope
and effort the innumer host of live that had gone to build thi
human reef and of the swift and ruthless destruct that had hung
over it all when i realis that the shadow had been roll back and
that men might still live in the street and thi dear vast dead citi
of mine be onc more aliv and power i felt a wave of emot that
wa near akin to tear
the torment wa over even that dai the heal would begin the
survivor of the peopl scatter over the countryleaderless lawless
foodless like sheep without a shepherdth thousand who had fled by
sea would begin to return the puls of life grow stronger and
stronger would beat again in the empti street and pour across the
vacant squar whatev destruct wa done the hand of the
destroy wa stai all the gaunt wreck the blacken skeleton of
hous that stare so dismal at the sunlit grass of the hill would
present be echo with the hammer of the restor and ring with
the tap of their trowel at the thought i extend my hand
toward the sky and began thank god in a year thought iin a year
with overwhelm forc came the thought of myself of my wife and the
old life of hope and tender help that had ceas for ever
ix
wreckag
and now come the strangest thing in my stori yet perhap it is not
altogeth strang i rememb clearli and coldli and vividli all
that i did that dai until the time that i stood weep and prais
god upon the summit of primros hill and then i forget
of the next three dai i know noth i have learn sinc that so
far from my be the first discover of the martian overthrow
sever such wander as myself had alreadi discov thi on the
previou night on manth firsthad gone to st martinslegrand
and while i shelter in the cabmen hut had contriv to telegraph
to pari thenc the joy new had flash all over the world a
thousand citi chill by ghastli apprehens suddenli flash
into frantic illumin thei knew of it in dublin edinburgh
manchest birmingham at the time when i stood upon the verg of the
pit alreadi men weep with joi as i have heard shout and
stai their work to shake hand and shout were make up train
even as near as crew to descend upon london the church bell that
had ceas a fortnight sinc suddenli caught the new until all
england wa bellring men on cycl leanfac unkempt scorch
along everi countri lane shout of unhop deliver shout to
gaunt stare figur of despair and for the food across the
channel across the irish sea across the atlant corn bread and
meat were tear to our relief all the ship in the world seem
go londonward in those dai but of all thi i have no memori i
drifteda dement man i found myself in a hous of kindli peopl who
had found me on the third dai wander weep and rave through
the street of st john wood thei have told me sinc that i wa
sing some insan doggerel about the last man left aliv hurrah
the last man left aliv troubl as thei were with their own affair
these peopl whose name much as i would like to express my gratitud
to them i mai not even give here nevertheless cumber themselv
with me shelter me and protect me from myself appar thei
had learn someth of my stori from me dure the dai of my laps
veri gentli when my mind wa assur again did thei break to me what
thei had learn of the fate of leatherhead two dai after i wa
imprison it had been destroi with everi soul in it by a martian
he had swept it out of exist as it seem without ani
provoc as a boi might crush an ant hill in the mere wanton
of power
i wa a lone man and thei were veri kind to me i wa a lone man
and a sad on and thei bore with me i remain with them four dai
after my recoveri all that time i felt a vagu a grow crave to
look onc more on whatev remain of the littl life that seem so
happi and bright in my past it wa a mere hopeless desir to feast
upon my miseri thei dissuad me thei did all thei could to divert me
from thi morbid but at last i could resist the impuls no longer
and promis faithfulli to return to them and part as i will
confess from these fourdai friend with tear i went out again into
the street that had late been so dark and strang and empti
alreadi thei were busi with return peopl in place even there were
shop open and i saw a drink fountain run water
i rememb how mockingli bright the dai seem as i went back on my
melancholi pilgrimag to the littl hous at woke how busi the
street and vivid the move life about me so mani peopl were abroad
everywher busi in a thousand activ that it seem incred
that ani great proport of the popul could have been slain but
then i notic how yellow were the skin of the peopl i met how
shaggi the hair of the men how larg and bright their ey and that
everi other man still wore hi dirti rag their face seem all with
on of two expressionsa leap exult and energi or a grim
resolut save for the express of the face london seem a citi
of tramp the vestri were indiscrimin distribut bread sent
us by the french govern the rib of the few hors show
dismal haggard special constabl with white badg stood at the
corner of everi street i saw littl of the mischief wrought by the
martian until i reach wellington street and there i saw the red
weed clamber over the buttress of waterloo bridg
at the corner of the bridg too i saw on of the common contrast of
that grotesqu timea sheet of paper flaunt against a thicket of the
red weed transfix by a stick that kept it in place it wa the
placard of the first newspap to resum publicationth daili mail
i bought a copi for a blacken shill i found in my pocket most of
it wa in blank but the solitari compositor who did the thing had
amus himself by make a grotesqu scheme of advertis stereo on
the back page the matter he print wa emot the new
organis had not as yet found it wai back i learn noth fresh
except that alreadi in on week the examin of the martian
mechan had yield astonish result among other thing the
articl assur me what i did not believ at the time that the secret
of fly wa discov at waterloo i found the free train that
were take peopl to their home the first rush wa alreadi over
there were few peopl in the train and i wa in no mood for casual
convers i got a compart to myself and sat with fold arm
look greyli at the sunlit devast that flow past the window
and just outsid the terminu the train jolt over temporari rail
and on either side of the railwai the hous were blacken ruin to
clapham junction the face of london wa grimi with powder of the black
smoke in spite of two dai of thunderstorm and rain and at clapham
junction the line had been wreck again there were hundr of
outofwork clerk and shopmen work side by side with the customari
navvi and we were jolt over a hasti relai
all down the line from there the aspect of the countri wa gaunt and
unfamiliar wimbledon particularli had suffer walton by virtu of
it unburn pine wood seem the least hurt of ani place along the
line the wandl the mole everi littl stream wa a heap mass of
red weed in appear between butcher meat and pickl cabbag the
surrei pine wood were too dry howev for the festoon of the red
climber beyond wimbledon within sight of the line in certain nurseri
ground were the heap mass of earth about the sixth cylind a
number of peopl were stand about it and some sapper were busi in
the midst of it over it flaunt a union jack flap cheerfulli in
the morn breez the nurseri ground were everywher crimson with
the weed a wide expans of livid colour cut with purpl shadow and
veri pain to the ey on gaze went with infinit relief from the
scorch grei and sullen red of the foreground to the bluegreen
soft of the eastward hill
the line on the london side of woke station wa still undergo
repair so i descend at byfleet station and took the road to mayburi
past the place where i and the artilleryman had talk to the hussar
and on by the spot where the martian had appear to me in the
thunderstorm here move by curios i turn asid to find among a
tangl of red frond the warp and broken dog cart with the whiten
bone of the hors scatter and gnaw for a time i stood regard
these vestig
then i return through the pine wood neckhigh with red weed here and
there to find the landlord of the spot dog had alreadi found
burial and so came home past the colleg arm a man stand at an
open cottag door greet me by name as i pass
i look at my hous with a quick flash of hope that fade immedi
the door had been forc it wa unfast and wa open slowli as i
approach
it slam again the curtain of my studi flutter out of the open
window from which i and the artilleryman had watch the dawn no on
had close it sinc the smash bush were just as i had left them
nearli four week ago i stumbl into the hall and the hous felt
empti the stair carpet wa ruffl and discolour where i had
crouch soak to the skin from the thunderstorm the night of the
catastroph our muddi footstep i saw still went up the stair
i follow them to my studi and found ly on my writingt still
with the selenit paper weight upon it the sheet of work i had left on
the afternoon of the open of the cylind for a space i stood
read over my abandon argument it wa a paper on the probabl
develop of moral idea with the develop of the civilis
process and the last sentenc wa the open of a propheci in about
two hundr year i had written we mai expect the sentenc end
abruptli i rememb my inabl to fix my mind that morn
scarc a month gone by and how i had broken off to get my daili
chronicl from the newsboi i rememb how i went down to the garden
gate as he came along and how i had listen to hi odd stori of men
from mar
i came down and went into the dine room there were the mutton and
the bread both far gone now in decai and a beer bottl overturn
just as i and the artilleryman had left them my home wa desol i
perceiv the folli of the faint hope i had cherish so long and then
a strang thing occur it is no us said a voic the hous is
desert no on ha been here these ten dai do not stai here to
torment yourself no on escap but you
i wa startl had i spoken my thought aloud i turn and the french
window wa open behind me i made a step to it and stood look out
and there amaz and afraid even as i stood amaz and afraid were
my cousin and my wifemi wife white and tearless she gave a faint cry
i came she said i knewknew
she put her hand to her throatswai i made a step forward and
caught her in my arm
x
the epilogu
i cannot but regret now that i am conclud my stori how littl i am
abl to contribut to the discuss of the mani debat question
which ar still unsettl in on respect i shall certainli provok
critic my particular provinc is specul philosophi my
knowledg of compar physiolog is confin to a book or two but
it seem to me that carver suggest as to the reason of the rapid
death of the martian is so probabl as to be regard almost as a
proven conclus i have assum that in the bodi of my narr
at ani rate in all the bodi of the martian that were examin after
the war no bacteria except those alreadi known as terrestri speci
were found that thei did not buri ani of their dead and the reckless
slaughter thei perpetr point also to an entir ignor of the
putrefact process but probabl as thi seem it is by no mean a
proven conclus
neither is the composit of the black smoke known which the martian
us with such deadli effect and the gener of the heatrai
remain a puzzl the terribl disast at the eal and south
kensington laboratori have disinclin analyst for further
investig upon the latter spectrum analysi of the black powder
point unmistak to the presenc of an unknown element with a
brilliant group of three line in the green and it is possibl that it
combin with argon to form a compound which act at onc with deadli
effect upon some constitu in the blood but such unproven
specul will scarc be of interest to the gener reader to
whom thi stori is address none of the brown scum that drift down
the thame after the destruct of shepperton wa examin at the
time and now none is forthcom
the result of an anatom examin of the martian so far as the
prowl dog had left such an examin possibl i have alreadi
given but everyon is familiar with the magnific and almost
complet specimen in spirit at the natur histori museum and the
countless draw that have been made from it and beyond that the
interest of their physiolog and structur is pure scientif
a question of graver and univers interest is the possibl of
anoth attack from the martian i do not think that nearli enough
attent is be given to thi aspect of the matter at present the
planet mar is in conjunct but with everi return to opposit i
for on anticip a renew of their adventur in ani case we
should be prepar it seem to me that it should be possibl to defin
the posit of the gun from which the shot ar discharg to keep a
sustain watch upon thi part of the planet and to anticip the
arriv of the next attack
in that case the cylind might be destroi with dynamit or artilleri
befor it wa suffici cool for the martian to emerg or thei
might be butcher by mean of gun so soon as the screw open it
seem to me that thei have lost a vast advantag in the failur of
their first surpris possibl thei see it in the same light
less ha advanc excel reason for suppos that the martian
have actual succeed in effect a land on the planet venu
seven month ago now venu and mar were in align with the sun
that is to sai mar wa in opposit from the point of view of an
observ on venu subsequ a peculiar lumin and sinuou mark
appear on the unillumin half of the inner planet and almost
simultan a faint dark mark of a similar sinuou charact wa
detect upon a photograph of the martian disk on need to see the
draw of these appear in order to appreci fulli their
remark resembl in charact
at ani rate whether we expect anoth invas or not our view of
the human futur must be greatli modifi by these event we have
learn now that we cannot regard thi planet as be fenc in and a
secur abid place for man we can never anticip the unseen good
or evil that mai come upon us suddenli out of space it mai be that in
the larger design of the univers thi invas from mar is not
without it ultim benefit for men it ha rob us of that seren
confid in the futur which is the most fruit sourc of
decad the gift to human scienc it ha brought ar enorm and
it ha done much to promot the concept of the commonw of
mankind it mai be that across the immens of space the martian have
watch the fate of these pioneer of their and learn their lesson
and that on the planet venu thei have found a secur settlement be
that as it mai for mani year yet there will certainli be no
relax of the eager scrutini of the martian disk and those fieri
dart of the sky the shoot star will bring with them as thei fall
an unavoid apprehens to all the son of men
the broaden of men view that ha result can scarc be
exagger befor the cylind fell there wa a gener persuas
that through all the deep of space no life exist beyond the petti
surfac of our minut sphere now we see further if the martian can
reach venu there is no reason to suppos that the thing is imposs
for men and when the slow cool of the sun make thi earth
uninhabit as at last it must do it mai be that the thread of life
that ha begun here will have stream out and caught our sister planet
within it toil
dim and wonder is the vision i have conjur up in my mind of life
spread slowli from thi littl seed bed of the solar system
throughout the inanim vast of sider space but that is a
remot dream it mai be on the other hand that the destruct of the
martian is onli a repriev to them and not to us perhap is the
futur ordain
i must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an abid
sens of doubt and insecur in my mind i sit in my studi write by
lamplight and suddenli i see again the heal vallei below set with
writh flame and feel the hous behind and about me empti and
desol i go out into the byfleet road and vehicl pass me a
butcher boi in a cart a cab of visitor a workman on a bicycl
children go to school and suddenli thei becom vagu and unreal
and i hurri again with the artilleryman through the hot brood
silenc of a night i see the black powder darken the silent
street and the contort bodi shroud in that layer thei rise
upon me tatter and dogbitten thei gibber and grow fiercer paler
uglier mad distort of human at last and i wake cold and
wretch in the dark of the night
i go to london and see the busi multitud in fleet street and the
strand and it come across my mind that thei ar but the ghost of the
past haunt the street that i have seen silent and wretch go
to and fro phantasm in a dead citi the mockeri of life in a
galvanis bodi and strang too it is to stand on primros hill as
i did but a dai befor write thi last chapter to see the great
provinc of hous dim and blue through the haze of the smoke and
mist vanish at last into the vagu lower sky to see the peopl
walk to and fro among the flower bed on the hill to see the
sightseer about the martian machin that stand there still to hear
the tumult of plai children and to recal the time when i saw it
all bright and clearcut hard and silent under the dawn of that last
great dai
and strangest of all is it to hold my wife hand again and to think
that i have count her and that she ha count me among the dead
