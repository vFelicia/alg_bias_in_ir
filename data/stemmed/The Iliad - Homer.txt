sceptic is as much the result of knowledg as knowledg is of
sceptic to be content with what we at present know is for the
most part to shut our ear against convict sinc from the veri
gradual charact of our educ we must continu forget and
emancip ourselv from knowledg previous acquir we must set
asid old notion and embrac fresh on and as we learn we must be
daili unlearn someth which it ha cost us no small labour and
anxieti to acquir
and thi difficulti attach itself more close to an ag in which
progress ha gain a strong ascend over prejudic and in which
person and thing ar dai by dai find their real level in lieu
of their convent valu the same principl which have swept awai
tradit abus and which ar make rapid havoc among the revenu

credul of on writer or the partial of anoth find as
power a touchston and as wholesom a chastis in the healthi
sceptic of a temper class of antagonist as the dream of
conservat or the impostur of pluralist sinecur in the church
histori and tradit whether of ancient or compar recent
time ar subject to veri differ handl from that which the
indulg or credul of former ag could allow mere statement ar
jealous watch and the motiv of the writer form as import an
ingredi in the analysi of hi histori as the fact he record
probabl is a power and troublesom test and it is by thi
troublesom standard that a larg portion of histor evid is
sift consist is no less pertinaci and exact in it
demand in brief to write a histori we must know more than mere
fact human natur view under an induct of extend experi
is the best help to the critic of human histori histor
charact can onli be estim by the standard which human
experi whether actual or traditionari ha furnish to form
correct view of individu we must regard them as form part of a

be by whom thei ar surround and in contempl the incid
in their live or condit which tradit ha hand down to us we
must rather consid the gener bear of the whole narr than
the respect probabl of it detail
it is unfortun for us that of some of the greatest men we know
least and talk most homer socrat and shakespere1 have perhap
contribut more to the intellectu enlighten of mankind than ani
other three writer who could be name and yet the histori of all
three ha given rise to a boundless ocean of discuss which ha left
us littl save the option of choos which theori or theori we will
follow the person of shakesper is perhap the onli thing in
which critic will allow us to believ without controversi but upon
everyth els even down to the authorship of plai there is more or
less of doubt and uncertainti of socrat we know as littl as the
contradict of plato and xenophon will allow us to know he wa on
of the dramati person in two drama as unlik in principl as in
style he appear as the enunci of opinion as differ in their
tone as those of the writer who have hand them down when we have
read plato or xenophon we think we know someth of socrat when
we have fairli read and examin both we feel convinc that we ar
someth wors than ignor
it ha been an easi and a popular expedi of late year to deni
the person or real exist of men and thing whose life and
condit were too much for our belief thi systemwhich ha often
comfort the religi sceptic and substitut the consol of
strauss for those of the new testamentha been of incalcul valu
to the histor theorist of the last and present centuri to
question the exist of alexand the great would be a more
excus act than to believ in that of romulu to deni a fact
relat in herodotu becaus it is inconsist with a theori
develop from an assyrian inscript which no two scholar read in
the same wai is more pardon than to believ in the goodnatur
old king whom the eleg pen of florian ha idealizednuma
pompiliu
sceptic ha attain it culmin point with respect to homer
and the state of our homer knowledg mai be describ as a free
permiss to believ ani theori provid we throw overboard all
written tradit concern the author or author of the iliad and
odyssei what few author exist on the subject ar summarili
dismiss although the argument appear to run in a circl thi
cannot be true becaus it is not true and that is not true becaus
it cannot be true such seem to be the style in which testimoni upon
testimoni statement upon statement is consign to denial and
oblivion
it is howev unfortun that the profess biographi of homer ar
partli forgeri partli freak of ingenu and imagin in which
truth is the requisit most want befor take a brief review of
the homer theori in it present condit some notic must be taken
of the treatis on the life of homer which ha been attribut to
herodotu
accord to thi document the citi of cum in olia wa at an
earli period the seat of frequent immigr from variou part of
greec among the immigr wa menapolu the son of ithagen
although poor he marri and the result of the union wa a girl name
crith the girl wa left an orphan at an earli ag under the
guardianship of cleanax of argo it is to the indiscret of thi
maiden that we ar indebt for so much happi homer wa the
first fruit of her juvenil frailti and receiv the name of
melesigen from have been born near the river mele in botia
whither crith had been transport in order to save her reput
at thi time continu our narr there live at smyrna a man

marri engag crith to manag hi household and spin the flax he
receiv as the price of hi scholast labour so satisfactori wa
her perform of thi task and so modest her conduct that he made
propos of marriag declar himself as a further induc

success excit the admir not onli of the inhabit of smyrna
but also of the stranger whom the trade carri on there especi

visitor on ment from leucadia the modern santa maura who
evinc a knowledg and intellig rare found in those time
persuad melesigen to close hi school and accompani him on hi
travel he promis not onli to pai hi expens but to furnish him
with a further stipend urg that while he wa yet young it wa
fit that he should see with hi own ey the countri and citi
which might hereaft be the subject of hi discours melesigen
consent and set out with hi patron examin all the curios
of the countri thei visit and inform himself of everyth by
interrog those whom he met we mai also suppos that he wrote
memoir of all that he deem worthi of preservation2 have set
sail from tyrrhenia and iberia thei reach ithaca here melesigen
who had alreadi suffer in hi ey becam much wors and ment
who wa about to leav for leucadia left him to the medic
superintend of a friend of hi name mentor the son of alcinor
under hi hospit and intellig host melesigen rapidli becam
acquaint with the legend respect ulyss which afterward form
the subject of the odyssei the inhabit of ithaca assert that it
wa here that melesigen becam blind but the colophoman make their
citi the seat of that misfortun he then return to smyrna where he
appli himself to the studi of poetry3
but poverti soon drove him to cum have pass over the herman
plain he arriv at neon teicho the new wall a coloni of cum
here hi misfortun and poetic talent gain him the friendship of
on tychia an armour and up to my time continu the author
the inhabit show the place where he us to sit when give a
recit of hi vers and thei greatli honour the spot here also
a poplar grew which thei said had sprung up ever sinc melesigen
arrived4
but poverti still drove him on and he went by wai of larissa as be
the most conveni road here the cuman sai he compos an epitaph
on gordiu king of phrygia which ha howev and with greater
probabl been attribut to cleobulu of lindus5
arriv at cum he frequent the converzationes6 of the old men
and delight all by the charm of hi poetri encourag by thi
favour recept he declar that if thei would allow him a
public mainten he would render their citi most glorious
renown thei avow their willing to support him in the measur
he propos and procur him an audienc in the council have made
the speech with the purport of which our author ha forgotten to
acquaint us he retir and left them to debat respect the answer
to be given to hi propos
the greater part of the assembl seem favour to the poet
demand but on man observ that if thei were to feed homer thei
would be encumb with a multitud of useless peopl from thi
circumst sai the writer melesigen acquir the name of
homer for the cuman call blind men homers7 with a love of
economi which show how similar the world ha alwai been in it
treatment of literari men the pension wa deni and the poet vent
hi disappoint in a wish that cuma might never produc a poet
capabl of give it renown and glori
at phoca homer wa destin to experi anoth literari distress
on thestorid who aim at the reput of poetic geniu kept
homer in hi own hous and allow him a pittanc on condit of the
vers of the poet pass in hi name have collect suffici
poetri to be profit thestorid like some wouldbeliterari
publish neglect the man whose brain he had suck and left him
at hi departur homer is said to have observ o thestorid of
the mani thing hidden from the knowledg of man noth is more
unintellig than the human heart8
homer continu hi career of difficulti and distress until some chian
merchant struck by the similar of the vers thei heard him
recit acquaint him with the fact that thestorid wa pursu a
profit livelihood by the recit of the veri same poem thi at
onc determin him to set out for chio no vessel happen then to be
set sail thither but he found on readi to start for erythr a
town of ionia which face that island and he prevail upon the
seamen to allow him to accompani them have embark he invok a
favour wind and prai that he might be abl to expos the
impostur of thestorid who by hi breach of hospit had drawn
down the wrath of jove the hospit
at erythr homer fortun met with a person who had known him in
phoca by whose assist he at length after some difficulti
reach the littl hamlet of pithi here he met with an adventur
which we will continu in the word of our author have set out from
pithi homer went on attract by the cri of some goat that were
pastur the dog bark on hi approach and he cri out glaucu
for that wa the name of the goatherd heard hi voic ran up
quickli call off hi dog and drove them awai from homer for some
time he stood wonder how a blind man should have reach such a
place alon and what could be hi design in come he then went up to
him and inquir who he wa and how he had come to desol place
and untrodden spot and of what he stood in need homer by recount
to him the whole histori of hi misfortun move him with compass
and he took him and led him to hi cot and have lit a fire bade
him sup9
the dog instead of eat kept bark at the stranger accord
to their usual habit whereupon homer address glaucu thu o
glaucu my friend prythe attend to my behest first give the dog
their supper at the door of the hut for so it is better sinc
whilst thei watch nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold
glaucu wa pleas with the advic and marvel at it author
have finish supper thei banqueted10 afresh on convers
homer narrat hi wander and tell of the citi he had
visit
at length thei retir to rest but on the follow morn glaucu
resolv to go to hi master and acquaint him with hi meet with
homer have left the goat in charg of a fellowserv he left
homer at home promis to return quickli have arriv at bolissu
a place near the farm and find hi mate he told him the whole
stori respect homer and hi journei he paid littl attent to
what he said and blame glaucu for hi stupid in take in and
feed maim and enfeebl person howev he bade him bring the
stranger to him
glaucu told homer what had taken place and bade him follow him
assur him that good fortun would be the result convers soon
show that the stranger wa a man of much clever and gener
knowledg and the chian persuad him to remain and to undertak the
charg of hi children11
besid the satisfact of drive the impostor thestorid from the
island homer enjoi consider success as a teacher in the town of
chio he establish a school where he taught the precept of poetri
to thi dai sai chandler12 the most curiou remain is that
which ha been name without reason the school of homer it is on the
coast at some distanc from the citi northward and appear to have
been an open templ of cybel form on the top of a rock the shape
is oval and in the centr is the imag of the goddess the head and an
arm want she is repres as usual sit the chair ha a
lion carv on each side and on the back the area is bound by a low
rim or seat and about five yard over the whole is hewn out of the
mountain is rude indistinct and probabl of the most remot
antiqu
so success wa thi school that homer realis a consider
fortun he marri and had two daughter on of whom di singl
the other marri a chian
the follow passag betrai the same tendenc to connect the
personag of the poem with the histori of the poet which ha alreadi
been mention
in hi poetic composit homer displai great gratitud toward
mentor of ithaca in the odyssei whose name he ha insert in hi
poem as the companion of ulysses13 in return for the care taken of
him when afflict with blind he also testifi hi gratitud to
phemiu who had given him both susten and instruct
hi celebr continu to increas and mani person advis him to
visit greec whither hi reput had now extend have it is
said made some addit to hi poem calcul to pleas the vaniti
of the athenian of whose citi he had hitherto made no mention14 he
sent out for samo here be recogn by a samian who had met with
him in chio he wa handsom receiv and invit to join in
celebr the apaturian festiv he recit some vers which gave
great satisfact and by sing the eiresion at the new moon
festiv he earn a subsist visit the hous of the rich
with whose children he wa veri popular
in the spring he sail for athen and arriv at the island of io
now ino where he fell extrem ill and di it is said that hi
death aros from vexat at not have been abl to unravel an enigma
propos by some fishermen children15
such is in brief the substanc of the earliest life of homer we
possess and so broad ar the evid of it histor
worthless that it is scarc necessari to point them out in
detail let us now consid some of the opinion to which a
persev patient and learnedbut by no mean consistentseri of
investig ha led in do so i profess to bring forward
statement not to vouch for their reason or probabl
homer appear the histori of thi poet and hi work is lost in
doubt obscur as is the histori of mani of the first mind who
have done honour to human becaus thei rose amidst dark the
majest stream of hi song bless and fertil flow like the
nile through mani land and nation and like the sourc of the
nile it fountain will ever remain conceal
such ar the word in which on of the most judici german critic
ha eloqu describ the uncertainti in which the whole of the
homer question is involv with no less truth and feel he
proce
it seem here of chief import to expect no more than the natur of
thing make possibl if the period of tradit in histori is the
region of twilight we should not expect in it perfect light the
creation of geniu alwai seem like miracl becaus thei ar for
the most part creat far out of the reach of observ if we were
in possess of all the histor testimoni we never could wholli
explain the origin of the iliad and the odyssei for their origin in
all essenti point must have remain the secret of the poet16
from thi critic which show as much insight into the depth of
human natur as into the minut wiredraw of scholast
investig let us pass on to the main question at issu wa homer
an individual17 or were the iliad and odyssei the result of an
ingeni arrang of fragment by earlier poet
well ha landor remark some tell us there were twenti homer some
deni that there wa ever on it were idl and foolish to shake the
content of a vase in order to let them settl at last we ar
perpetu labour to destroi our delight our composur our
devot to superior power of all the anim on earth we least know
what is good for us my opinion is that what is best for us is our
admir of good no man live vener homer more than i do18
but greatli as we admir the gener enthusiasm which rest content
with the poetri on which it best impuls had been nurtur and
foster without seek to destroi the vivid of first impress
by minut analysisour editori offic compel us to give some
attent to the doubt and difficulti with which the homer
question is beset and to entreat our reader for a brief period to
prefer hi judgment to hi imagin and to condescend to dry
detail
befor howev enter into particular respect the question of
thi uniti of the homer poem at least of the iliad i must
express my sympathi with the sentiment express in the follow
remark
we cannot but think the univers admir of it uniti by the
better the poetic ag of greec almost conclus testimoni to it
origin composit it wa not till the ag of the grammarian that
it primit integr wa call in question nor is it injustic to
assert that the minut and analyt spirit of a grammarian is not
the best qualif for the profound feel the comprehens
concept of an harmoni whole the most exquisit anatomist mai be
no judg of the symmetri of the human frame and we would take the
opinion of chantrei or westmacott on the proport and gener beauti
of a form rather than that of mr brodi or sir astlei cooper
there is some truth though some malici exagger in the line
of pope
the critic eyethat microscop of wit
see hair and pore examin bit by bit
how part relat to part or thei to whole
the bodi harmoni the beam soul
ar thing which kuster burmann wass shall see
when man whole frame is obviou to a flea19
long wa the time which elaps befor ani on dreamt of question
the uniti of the authorship of the homer poem the grave and
cautiou thucydid quot without hesit the hymn to apollo20
the authent of which ha been alreadi disclaim by modern
critic longinu in an oft quot passag mere express an
opinion touch the compar inferior of the odyssei to the
iliad21 and among a mass of ancient author whose veri names22
it would be tediou to detail no suspicion of the person
nonexist of homer ever aros so far the voic of antiqu seem
to be in favour of our earli idea on the subject let us now see what
ar the discoveri to which more modern investig lai claim
at the end of the seventeenth centuri doubt had begun to awaken on
the subject and we find bentlei remark that homer wrote a sequel
of song and rhapsodi to be sung by himself for small come and
good cheer at festiv and other dai of merriment these loos song
were not collect togeth in the form of an epic poem till about
peisistratu time about five hundr year after23
two french writershedelin and perraultavow a similar sceptic on
the subject but it is in the scienza nuova of battista vico that we
first meet with the germ of the theori subsequ defend by wolf
with so much learn and acut inde it is with the wolfian
theori that we have chiefli to deal and with the follow bold
hypothesi which we will detail in the word of grote24
half a centuri ago the acut and valuabl prolegomena of f a wolf
turn to account the venetian scholia which had then been recent
publish first open philosoph discuss as to the histori of
the homer text a consider part of that dissert though by
no mean the whole is emploi in vindic the posit previous
announc by bentlei amongst other that the separ constitu
portion of the iliad and odyssei had not been cement togeth into
ani compact bodi and unchang order until the dai of
peisistratu in the sixth centuri befor christ as a step toward
that conclus wolf maintain that no written copi of either poem
could be shown to have exist dure the earlier time to which their
composit is refer and that without write neither the perfect
symmetri of so complic a work could have been origin conceiv
by ani poet nor if realiz by him transmit with assur to
poster the absenc of easi and conveni write such as must be
indispens suppos for long manuscript among the earli greek
wa thu on of the point in wolf case against the primit
integr of the iliad and odyssei by nitzsch and other lead
oppon of wolf the connect of the on with the other seem to
have been accept as he origin put it and it ha been consid
incumb on those who defend the ancient aggreg charact of the
iliad and odyssei to maintain that thei were written poem from the
begin
to me it appear that the architecton function ascrib by wolf to
peisistratu and hi associ in refer to the homer poem ar
nowis admiss but much would undoubtedli be gain toward that
view of the question if it could be shown that in order to
controvert it we were driven to the necess of admit long
written poem in the ninth centuri befor the christian ra few
thing in my opinion can be more improb and mr payn knight
oppos as he is to the wolfian hypothesi admit thi no less than
wolf himself the trace of write in greec even in the seventh
centuri befor the christian ra ar exceedingli trifl we have no
remain inscript earlier than the fortieth olympiad and the earli
inscript ar rude and unskilfulli execut nor can we even assur
ourselv whether archilochu simonid of amorgu kallinu
tyrtu xanthu and the other earli elegiac and lyric poet
commit their composit to write or at what time the practic
of do so becam familiar the first posit ground which author
us to presum the exist of a manuscript of homer is in the famou
ordin of soln with regard to the rhapsodi at the panathena
but for what length of time previous manuscript had exist we ar
unabl to sai
those who maintain the homer poem to have been written from the
begin rest their case not upon posit proof nor yet upon the
exist habit of societi with regard to poetryfor thei admit
gener that the iliad and odyssei were not read but recit and
heardbut upon the suppos necess that there must have been
manuscript to ensur the preserv of the poemsth unassist
memori of recit be neither suffici nor trustworthi but here
we onli escap a smaller difficulti by run into a greater for the
exist of train bard gift with extraordinari memory25 is
far less astonish than that of long manuscript in an ag
essenti nonread and nonwrit and when even suitabl
instrument and materi for the process ar not obviou moreov
there is a strong posit reason for believ that the bard wa under
no necess of refresh hi memori by consult a manuscript for
if such had been the fact blind would have been a disqualif
for the profess which we know that it wa not as well from the
exampl of demodoku in the odyssei as from that of the blind bard of
chio in the hymn to the delian apollo whom thucydid as well as
the gener tenor of grecian legend identifi with homer himself the
author of that hymn be he who he mai could never have describ a
blind man as attain the utmost perfect in hi art if he had been
consciou that the memori of the bard wa onli maintain by constant
refer to the manuscript in hi chest
the loss of the digamma that crux of critic that quicksand upon
which even the acumen of bentlei wa shipwreck seem to prove beyond
a doubt that the pronunci of the greek languag had undergon a
consider chang now it is certainli difficult to suppos that the
homer poem could have suffer by thi chang had written copi
been preserv if chaucer poetri for instanc had not been
written it could onli have come down to us in a soften form more
like the effemin version of dryden than the rough quaint nobl
origin
at what period continu grote these poem or inde ani other
greek poem first began to be written must be matter of conjectur
though there is ground for assur that it wa befor the time of
soln if in the absenc of evid we mai ventur upon name ani
more determin period the question at onc suggest itself what
were the purpos which in that state of societi a manuscript at it
first commenc must have been intend to answer for whom wa a
written iliad necessari not for the rhapsod for with them it wa
not onli plant in the memori but also interwoven with the feel
and conceiv in conjunct with all those flexion and inton of
voic paus and other oral artific which were requir for
emphat deliveri and which the nake manuscript could never
reproduc not for the gener publicthei were accustom to receiv
it with it rhapsod deliveri and with it accompani of a solemn
and crowd festiv the onli person for whom the written iliad would
be suitabl would be a select few studiou and curiou men a class of
reader capabl of analyz the complic emot which thei had
experienc as hearer in the crowd and who would on perus the
written word realiz in their imagin a sensibl portion of the
impress commun by the recit incred as the statement mai
seem in an ag like the present there is in all earli societi and
there wa in earli greec a time when no such read class exist
if we could discov at what time such a class first began to be
form we should be abl to make a guess at the time when the old epic
poem were first commit to write now the period which mai with
the greatest probabl be fix upon as have first wit the
format even of the narrowest read class in greec is the middl
of the seventh centuri befor the christian ra bc 660 to bc
630 the ag of terpand kallinu archilochu simonid of
amorgu c i ground thi supposit on the chang then oper in
the charact and tendenc of grecian poetri and musicth elegiac
and the iambic measur have been introduc as rival to the
primit hexamet and poetic composit have been transfer
from the epic past to the affair of present and real life such a
chang wa import at a time when poetri wa the onli known mode of
public to us a modern phrase not altogeth suitabl yet the
nearest approach to the sens it argu a new wai of look at
the old epic treasur of the peopl as well as a thirst for new
poetic effect and the men who stood forward in it mai well be
consid as desir to studi and compet to critic from their
own individu point of view the written word of the homer
rhapsodi just as we ar told that kallinu both notic and
eulog the theba as the product of homer there seem
therefor ground for conjectur that for the us of thi
newlyform and import but veri narrow class manuscript of the
homer poem and other old epicsth theba and the cypria as well
as the iliad and the odysseybegan to be compil toward the middl
of the seventh centuri bc 1 and the open of egypt to grecian
commerc which took place about the same period would furnish
increas facil for obtain the requisit papyru to write upon
a read class when onc form would doubtless slowli increas and
the number of manuscript along with it so that befor the time of
soln fifti year afterward both reader and manuscript though
still compar few might have attain a certain recogn
author and form a tribun of refer against the careless
of individu rhapsodes26
but even peisistratu ha not been suffer to remain in possess of
the credit and we cannot help feel the forc of the follow
observ
there ar sever incident circumst which in our opinion
throw some suspicion over the whole histori of the peisistratid
compil at least over the theori that the iliad wa cast into it
present state and harmoni form by the direct of the athenian
ruler if the great poet who flourish at the bright period of
grecian song of which ala we have inherit littl more than the
fame and the faint echo if stesichoru anacreon and simonid were
emploi in the nobl task of compil the iliad and odyssei so much
must have been done to arrang to connect to harmon that it is
almost incred that stronger mark of athenian manufactur should
not remain whatev occasion anomali mai be detect anomali
which no doubt aris out of our own ignor of the languag of the
homer ag howev the irregular us of the digamma mai have
perplex our bentlei to whom the name of helen is said to have
caus as much disquiet and distress as the fair on herself among the
hero of her ag howev mr knight mai have fail in reduc the
homer languag to it primit form howev final the attic
dialect mai not have assum all it more mark and distinguish
characteristicsstil it is difficult to suppos that the languag
particularli in the join and transit and connect part
should not more clearli betrai the incongru between the more ancient
and modern form of express it is not quit in charact with such
a period to imit an antiqu style in order to piec out an
imperfect poem in the charact of the origin as sir walter scott
ha done in hi continu of sir tristram
if howev not even such faint and indistinct trace of athenian
compil ar discover in the languag of the poem the total
absenc of athenian nation feel is perhap no less worthi of
observ in later and it mai fairli be suspect in earlier time
the athenian were more than ordinarili jealou of the fame of their
ancestor but amid all the tradit of the glori of earli greec
embodi in the iliad the athenian plai a most subordin and
insignific part even the few passag which relat to their
ancestor mr knight suspect to be interpol it is possibl
inde that in it lead outlin the iliad mai be true to histor
fact that in the great maritim expedit of western greec against
the rival and halfkindr empir of the laomedontiad the chieftain
of thessali from hi valour and the number of hi forc mai have
been the most import alli of the peloponnesian sovereign the
preemin valu of the ancient poetri on the trojan war mai thu have
forc the nation feel of the athenian to yield to their tast
the song which spoke of their own great ancestor were no doubt of
far inferior sublim and popular or at first sight a theseid
would have been much more like to have eman from an athenian
synod of compil of ancient song than an achilleid or an olysseid
could franc have given birth to a tasso tancr would have been the
hero of the jerusalem if howev the homer ballad as thei ar
sometim call which relat the wrath of achil with all it
dire consequ were so far superior to the rest of the poetic
cycl as to admit no rivalryit is still surpris that throughout
the whole poem the callida junctura should never betrai the workmanship
of an athenian hand and that the nation spirit of a race who have
at a later period not inaptli been compar to our self admir
neighbour the french should submit with lofti self denial to the
almost total exclus of their own ancestorsor at least to the
question digniti of onli have produc a leader toler skill
in the militari tactic of hi age27
to return to the wolfian theori while it is to be confess that
wolf object to the primit integr of the iliad and odyssei
have never been wholli got over we cannot help discov that thei
have fail to enlighten us as to ani substanti point and that the
difficulti with which the whole subject is beset ar rather
augment than otherwis if we admit hi hypothesi nor is
lachmanns28 modif of hi theori ani better he divid the
first twentytwo book of the iliad into sixteen differ song and
treat as ridicul the belief that their amalgam into on
regular poem belong to a period earlier than the ag of peisistratu
thi as grote observ explain the gap and contradict in the
narr but it explain noth els moreov we find no
contradict warrant thi belief and the socal sixteen poet
concur in get rid of the follow lead men in the first battl
after the secess of achil elphenor chief of the euban
tlepolemu of the rhodian pandaru of the lycian odiu of the
halizonian pirou and acama of the thracian none of these hero
again make their appear and we can but agre with colonel mure
that it seem strang that ani number of independ poet should have
so harmoni dispens with the servic of all six in the sequel
the discrep by which pylmen who is repres as dead in the
fifth book weep at hi son funer in the thirteenth can onli be
regard as the result of an interpol
grote although not veri distinct in state hi own opinion on the
subject ha done much to clearli show the incongru of the wolfian
theori and of lachmann modif with the charact of
peisistratu but he ha also shown and we think with equal success
that the two question rel to the primit uniti of these poem
or suppos that imposs the unison of these part by
peisistratu and not befor hi time ar essenti distinct in
short a man mai believ the iliad to have been put togeth out of
preexist song without recognis the ag of peisistratu as the
period of it first compil the friend or literari emploi of
peisistratu must have found an iliad that wa alreadi ancient and the
silenc of the alexandrin critic respect the peisistrat
recens goe far to prove that among the numer manuscript
thei examin thi wa either want or thought unworthi of
attent
moreov he continu the whole tenor of the poem themselv
confirm what is here remark there is noth either in the iliad
or odyssei which savour of modern appli that term to the ag
of peisistratusnoth which bring to our view the alter
brought about by two centuri in the greek languag the coin
monei the habit of write and read the despot and republican
govern the close militari arrai the improv construct of
ship the amphiktyon convoc the mutual frequent of
religi festiv the orient and egyptian vein of religion c
familiar to the latter epoch these alter onomakritu and the
other literari friend of peisistratu could hardli have fail to
notic even without design had thei then for the first time
undertaken the task of piec togeth mani self exist epic into
on larg aggreg everyth in the two great homer poem both in
substanc and in languag belong to an ag two or three centuri
earlier than peisistratu inde even the interpol or those
passag which on the best ground ar pronounc to be such betrai
no trace of the sixth centuri befor christ and mai well have been
heard by archilochu and kallinusin some case even by arktinu and
hesioda genuin homer matter29 as far as the evid on the
case as well intern as extern enabl us to judg we seem
warrant in believ that the iliad and odyssei were recit
substanti as thei now stand alwai allow for partial
diverg of text and interpol in 776 bc our first
trustworthi mark of grecian time and thi ancient date let it be
ad as it is the bestauthent fact so it is also the most
import attribut of the homer poem consid in refer to
grecian histori for thei thu afford us an insight into the
antihistor charact of the greek enabl us to trace the
subsequ forward march of the nation and to seiz instruct
contrast between their former and their later condition30
on the whole i am inclin to believ that the labour of
peisistratu were wholli of an editori charact although i must
confess that i can lai down noth respect the extent of hi
labour at the same time so far from believ that the composit
or primari arrang of these poem in their present form wa the
work of peisistratu i am rather persuad that the fine tast and
eleg mind of that athenian31 would lead him to preserv an ancient
and tradit order of the poem rather than to patch and
reconstruct them accord to a fanci hypothesi i will not repeat
the mani discuss respect whether the poem were written or not
or whether the art of write wa known in the time of their reput
author suffic it to sai that the more we read the less satisfi we
ar upon either subject
i cannot howev help think that the stori which attribut the
preserv of these poem to lycurgu is littl els than a version
of the same stori as that of peisistratu while it histor
probabl must be measur by that of mani other relat to the
spartan confuciu
i will conclud thi sketch of the homer theori with an attempt
made by an ingeni friend to unit them into someth like
consist it is as follow
no doubt the common soldier of that ag had like the common sailor
of some fifti year ago some on qualifi to discours in excel
music among them mani of these like those of the negro in the
unit state were extemporan and allus to event pass
around them but what wa pass around them the grand event of a
spiritstir war occurr like to impress themselv as the
mystic legend of former time had done upon their memori besid
which a retent memori wa deem a virtu of the first water and
wa cultiv accordingli in those ancient time ballad at first
and down to the begin of the war with troi were mere
recit with an inton then follow a speci of recit
probabl with an inton burden tune next follow as it aid the
memori consider
it wa at thi period about four hundr year after the war that a
poet flourish of the name of melesigen or monid but most
probabl the former he saw that these ballad might be made of great
util to hi purpos of write a poem on the social posit of
hella and as a collect he publish these lai connect them
by a tale of hi own thi poem now exist under the titl of the
odyssea the author howev did not affix hi own name to the poem
which in fact wa great part of it remodel from the archaic
dialect of crete in which tongu the ballad were found by him he
therefor call it the poem of homero or the collector but thi is
rather a proof of hi modesti and talent than of hi mere drudg
arrang of other peopl idea for as grote ha fine observ
argu for the uniti of authorship a great poet might have recast
preexist separ song into on comprehens whole but no mere
arrang or compil would be compet to do so
while emploi on the wild legend of odysseu he met with a ballad
record the quarrel of achil and agamemnon hi nobl mind seiz
the hint that there present itself and the achilles32 grew under
hi hand uniti of design howev caus him to publish the poem
under the same pseudonym as hi former work and the disjoint lai
of the ancient bard were join togeth like those relat to the
cid into a chronicl histori name the iliad melesigen knew that
the poem wa destin to be a last on and so it ha prove but
first the poem were destin to undergo mani vicissitud and
corrupt by the peopl who took to sing them in the street
assembl and agora howev soln first and then peisistratu
and afterward aristotel and other revis the poem and restor
the work of melesigen homero to their origin integr in a great
measure33
have thu given some gener notion of the strang theori which
have develop themselv respect thi most interest subject i
must still express my convict as to the uniti of the authorship of
the homer poem to deni that mani corrupt and interpol
disfigur them and that the intrus hand of the poetast mai here
and there have inflict a wound more seriou than the neglig of
the copyist would be an absurd and captiou assumpt but it is to a
higher critic that we must appeal if we would either understand or
enjoi these poem in maintain the authent and person of
their on author be he homer or melesigen quocunqu nomin vocari
eum ju fasqu sit i feel consciou that while the whole weight of
histor evid is against the hypothesi which would assign these
great work to a plural of author the most power intern
evid and that which spring from the deepest and most immedi
impuls of the soul also speak eloqu to the contrari
the minuti of verbal critic i am far from seek to despis
inde consid the charact of some of my own book such an
attempt would be gross inconsist but while i appreci it
import in a philolog view i am inclin to set littl store on
it sthetic valu especi in poetri three part of the
emend made upon poet ar mere alter some of which had
thei been suggest to the author by hi mcena or africanu he
would probabl have adopt moreov those who ar most exact in
lai down rule of verbal critic and interpret ar often
least compet to carri out their own precept grammarian ar not
poet by profess but mai be so per acciden i do not at thi
moment rememb two emend on homer calcul to substanti
improv the poetri of a passag although a mass of remark from
herodotu down to loew have given us the histori of a thousand minut
point without which our greek knowledg would be gloomi and jejun
but it is not on word onli that grammarian mere grammarian will
exercis their elabor and often tiresom ingenu bind down an
heroic or dramat poet to the block upon which thei have previous
dissect hi word and sentenc thei proce to us the ax and the
prune knife by wholesal and inconsist in everyth but their
wish to make out a case of unlaw affili thei cut out book
after book passag after passag till the author is reduc to a
collect of fragment or till those who fanci thei possess the
work of some great man find that thei have been put off with a vile
counterfeit got up at second hand if we compar the theori of
knight wolf lachmann and other we shall feel better satisfi of
the utter uncertainti of critic than of the apocryph posit of
homer on reject what anoth consid the turningpoint of hi
theori on cut a suppos knot by expung what anoth would
explain by omit someth els
nor is thi morbid speci of sagac by ani mean to be look upon
as a literari novelti justu lipsiu a scholar of no ordinari skill
seem to revel in the imaginari discoveri that the tragedi
attribut to seneca ar by four differ authors34 now i will
ventur to assert that these tragedi ar so uniform not onli in
their borrow phraseologya phraseolog with which writer like
boethiu and saxo grammaticu were more charm than ourselvesin their
freedom from real poetri and last but not least in an ultrarefin
and consist abandon of good tast that few writer of the
present dai would question the capabl of the same gentleman be
he seneca or not to produc not onli these but a great mani more
equal bad with equal sagac father hardouin astonish the world
with the startl announc that the neid of virgil and the
satir of horac were literari decept now without wish to
sai on word of disrespect against the industri and learningnai the
refin acutenesswhich scholar like wolf have bestow upon thi
subject i must express my fear that mani of our modern homer
theori will becom matter for the surpris and entertain rather
than the instruct of poster nor can i help think that the
literari histori of more recent time will account for mani point of
difficulti in the transmiss of the iliad and odyssei to a period so
remot from that of their first creation
i have alreadi express my belief that the labour of peisistratu
were of a pure editori charact and there seem no more reason
why corrupt and imperfect edit of homer mai not have been abroad in
hi dai than that the poem of valeriu flaccu and tibullu should
have given so much troubl to poggio scalig and other but after
all the main fault in all the homer theori is that thei demand
too great a sacrific of those feel to which poetri most powerfulli
appeal and which ar it most fit judg the ingenu which ha
sought to rob us of the name and exist of homer doe too much
violenc to that inward emot which make our whole soul yearn with
love and admir for the blind bard of chio to believ the author
of the iliad a mere compil is to degrad the power of human
invent to elev analyt judgment at the expens of the most
ennobl impuls of the soul and to forget the ocean in the
contempl of a polypu there is a cathol so to speak in the
veri name of homer our faith in the author of the iliad mai be a
mistaken on but as yet nobodi ha taught us a better
while howev i look upon the belief in homer as on that ha natur
herself for it mainspr while i can join with old enniu in
believ in homer as the ghost who like some patron saint hover
round the bed of the poet and even bestow rare gift from that wealth
of imagin which a host of imit could not exhauststil i am
far from wish to deni that the author of these great poem found a
rich fund of tradit a wellstock mythic storehous from whenc
he might deriv both subject and embellish but it is on thing to
us exist romanc in the embellish of a poem anoth to
patch up the poem itself from such materi what consist of style
and execut can be hope for from such an attempt or rather what
bad tast and tedium will not be the infal result
a blend of popular legend and a free us of the song of other
bard ar featur perfectli consist with poetic origin in
fact the most origin writer is still draw upon outward
impressionsnai even hi own thought ar a kind of secondari agent
which support and feed the impuls of imagin but unless there be
some grand pervad principlesom invis yet most distinctli
stamp archetypu of the great whole a poem like the iliad can never
come to the birth tradit the most picturesqu episod the most
pathet local associ teem with the thought of god and
great men mai crowd in on mighti vision or reveal themselv in more
substanti form to the mind of the poet but except the power to
creat a grand whole to which these shall be but as detail and
embellish be present we shall have nought but a scrapbook a
parterr fill with flower and weed strangl each other in their
wild redund we shall have a cento of rag and tatter which will
requir littl acut to detect
sensibl as i am of the difficulti of disprov a neg and awar
as i must be of the weighti ground there ar for oppos my belief
it still seem to me that the homer question is on that is reserv
for a higher critic than it ha often obtain we ar not by natur
intend to know all thing still less to compass the power by which
the greatest bless of life have been place at our dispos were
faith no virtu then we might inde wonder why god will our
ignor on ani matter but we ar too well taught the contrari
lesson and it seem as though our faith should be especi tri
touch the men and the event which have wrought most influenc upon
the condit of human and there is a kind of sacred attach
to the memori of the great and the good which seem to bid us repuls
the sceptic which would allegor their exist into a pleas
apologu and measur the giant of intellect by an homeopath
dynamet
long and habitu read of homer appear to familiar our thought
even to hi incongru or rather if we read in a right spirit and
with a heartfelt appreci we ar too much dazzl too deepli
wrap in admir of the whole to dwell upon the minut spot
which mere analysi can discov in read an heroic poem we must
transform ourselv into hero of the time be we in imagin
must fight over the same battl woo the same love burn with the
same sens of injuri as an achil or a hector and if we can but
attain thi degre of enthusiasm and less enthusiasm will scarc
suffic for the read of homer we shall feel that the poem of
homer ar not onli the work of on writer but of the greatest writer
that ever touch the heart of men by the power of song
and it wa thi suppos uniti of authorship which gave these poem
their power influenc over the mind of the men of old heeren who
is evid littl dispos in favour of modern theori fine
observ
it wa homer who form the charact of the greek nation no poet ha
ever as a poet exercis a similar influenc over hi countrymen
prophet lawgiv and sage have form the charact of other
nation it wa reserv to a poet to form that of the greek thi is
a featur in their charact which wa not wholli eras even in the
period of their degeneraci when lawgiv and sage appear in
greec the work of the poet had alreadi been accomplish and thei
paid homag to hi superior geniu he held up befor hi nation the
mirror in which thei were to behold the world of god and hero no
less than of feebl mortal and to behold them reflect with puriti
and truth hi poem ar found on the first feel of human natur
on the love of children wife and countri on that passion which
outweigh all other the love of glori hi song were pour forth
from a breast which sympath with all the feel of man and
therefor thei enter and will continu to enter everi breast which
cherish the same sympathi if it is grant to hi immort spirit
from anoth heaven than ani of which he dream on earth to look down
on hi race to see the nation from the field of asia to the forest
of hercynia perform pilgrimag to the fountain which hi magic
wand caus to flow if it is permit to him to view the vast
assemblag of grand of elev of gloriou product which had
been call into be by mean of hi song wherev hi immort

can we contempl that ancient monument on which the apotheosi of
homer36 is depictur and not feel how much of pleas
associ how much that appeal most forcibl and most distinctli to
our mind is lost by the admitt of ani theori but our old
tradit the more we read and the more we thinkthink as becom the
reader of homerth more root becom the convict that the
father of poetri gave us thi rich inherit whole and entir
whatev were the mean of it preserv let us rather be thank
for the treasuri of tast and eloqu thu laid open to our us than
seek to make it a mere centr around which to drive a seri of
theori whose wild is onli equal by their inconsist with
each other
as the hymn and some other poem usual ascrib to homer ar not
includ in pope translat i will content myself with a brief
account of the battl of the frog and mice from the pen of a writer
who ha done it full justice37
thi poem sai coleridg is a short mockhero of ancient date
the text vari in differ edit and is obvious disturb and
corrupt to a great degre it is commonli said to have been a juvenil
essai of homer geniu other have attribut it to the same pigre
mention abov and whose reput for humour seem to have invit
the appropri of ani piec of ancient wit the author of which wa
uncertain so littl did the greek befor the ag of the ptolemi
know or care about that depart of critic emploi in determin
the genuin of ancient write as to thi littl poem be a
youth profus of homer it seem suffici to sai that from the
begin to the end it is a plain and palpabl parodi not onli of the
gener spirit but of the numer passag of the iliad itself and
even if no such intent to parodi were discern in it the
object would still remain that to suppos a work of mere burlesqu
to be the primari effort of poetri in a simpl ag seem to revers
that order in the develop of nation tast which the histori of
everi other peopl in europ and of mani in asia ha almost
ascertain to be a law of the human mind it is in a state of societi
much more refin and perman than that describ in the iliad that
ani popular would attend such a ridicul of war and the god as is
contain in thi poem and the fact of there have exist three
other poem of the same kind attribut for aught we can see with as
much reason to homer is a strong induc to believ that none of
them were of the homer ag knight infer from the usag of the word
delto write tablet instead of skin which accord
to herod 5 58 wa the materi emploi by the asiat greek for
that purpos that thi poem wa anoth offspr of attic ingenu
and gener that the familiar mention of the cock v 191 is a
strong argument against so ancient a date for it composit
have thu given a brief account of the poem compris in pope
design i will now proce to make a few remark on hi translat
and on my own purpos in the present edit
pope wa not a grecian hi whole educ had been irregular and hi
earliest acquaint with the poet wa through the version of ogilbi
it is not too much to sai that hi whole work bear the impress of a
disposit to be satisfi with the gener sens rather than to dive
deepli into the minut and delic featur of languag henc hi
whole work is to be look upon rather as an eleg paraphras than a
translat there ar to be sure certain convent anecdot
which prove that pope consult variou friend whose classic
attain were sounder than hi own dure the undertak but it
is probabl that these examin were the result rather of the
contradictori version alreadi exist than of a desir to make a
perfect transcript of the origin and in those dai what is call
liter translat wa less cultiv than at present if someth
like the gener sens could be decor with the easi grace of
a practis poet if the charm of metric cadenc and a pleas
fluenci could be made consist with a fair interpret of the
poet mean hi word were less jealous sought for and those
who could read so good a poem as pope iliad had fair reason to be
satisfi
it would be absurd therefor to test pope translat by our own
advanc knowledg of the origin text we must be content to look at
it as a most delight work in itselfa work which is as much a part
of english literatur as homer himself is of greek we must not be torn
from our kindli associ with the old iliad that onc wa our most
cherish companion or our most lookedfor prize mere becaus
buttmann loew and liddel have made us so much more accur as to
be an adject and not a substant far be it from
us to defend the fault of pope especi when we think of chapman
fine bold rough old englishfar be it from us to hold up hi
translat as what a translat of homer might be but we can still
dismiss pope iliad to the hand of our reader with the
conscious that thei must have read a veri great number of book
befor thei have read it fellow
as to the note accompani the present volum thei ar drawn up
without pretens and mainli with the view of help the gener
reader have some littl time sinc translat all the work of homer
for anoth publish i might have brought a larg amount of
accumul matter sometim of a critic charact to bear upon the
text but pope version wa no field for such a displai and my
purpos wa to touch briefli on antiquarian or mytholog allus
to notic occasion some departur from the origin and to give
a few parallel passag from our english homer milton in the latter
task i cannot pretend to novelti but i trust that my other
annot while utterli disclaim high scholast view will be
found to convei as much as is want at least as far as the necessari
limit of these volum could be expect to admit to write a
commentari on homer is not my present aim but if i have made pope
translat a littl more entertain and instruct to a mass of
miscellan reader i shall consid my wish satisfactorili

pope prefac to the iliad of homer
homer is univers allow to have had the greatest invent of ani
writer whatev the prais of judgment virgil ha justli contest
with him and other mai have their pretens as to particular
excel but hi invent remain yet unrival nor is it a
wonder if he ha ever been acknowledg the greatest of poet who most
excel in that which is the veri foundat of poetri it is the
invent that in differ degre distinguish all great genius
the utmost stretch of human studi learn and industri which
master everyth besid can never attain to thi it furnish art
with all her materi and without it judgment itself can at best but
steal wise for art is onli like a prudent steward that live on
manag the rich of natur whatev prais mai be given to work
of judgment there is not even a singl beauti in them to which the
invent must not contribut as in the most regular garden art can
onli reduc beauti of natur to more regular and such a figur
which the common ey mai better take in and is therefor more
entertain with and perhap the reason why common critic ar
inclin to prefer a judici and method geniu to a great and
fruit on is becaus thei find it easier for themselv to pursu
their observ through a uniform and bound walk of art than to
comprehend the vast and variou extent of natur
our author work is a wild paradis where if we cannot see all the
beauti so distinctli as in an order garden it is onli becaus the
number of them is infinit greater it is like a copiou nurseri
which contain the seed and first product of everi kind out of
which those who follow him have but select some particular plant
each accord to hi fanci to cultiv and beautifi if some thing
ar too luxuri it is ow to the rich of the soil and if
other ar not arriv to perfect or matur it is onli becaus
thei ar overrun and oppress by those of a stronger natur
it is to the strength of thi amaz invent we ar to attribut
that unequal fire and raptur which is so forcibl in homer that no
man of a true poetic spirit is master of himself while he read him
what he write is of the most anim natur imagin everi thing
move everi thing live and is put in action if a council be call
or a battl fought you ar not coldli inform of what wa said or
done as from a third person the reader is hurri out of himself by
the forc of the poet imagin and turn in on place to a
hearer in anoth to a spectat the cours of hi vers resembl
that of the armi he describ
thei pour along like a fire that sweep the whole earth befor it it
is howev remark that hi fanci which is everywher vigor
is not discov immedi at the begin of hi poem in it
fullest splendour it grow in the progress both upon himself and
other and becom on fire like a chariotwheel by it own rapid
exact disposit just thought correct elocut polish number
mai have been found in a thousand but thi poetic fire thi vivida
vi animi in a veri few even in work where all those ar imperfect
or neglect thi can overpow critic and make us admir even
while we disapprov nai where thi appear though attend with
absurd it brighten all the rubbish about it till we see noth
but it own splendour thi fire is discern in virgil but discern
as through a glass reflect from homer more shine than fierc but
everywher equal and constant in lucan and statiu it burst out in
sudden short and interrupt flash in milton it glow like a
furnac kept up to an uncommon ardour by the forc of art in
shakspear it strike befor we ar awar like an accident fire from
heaven but in homer and in him onli it burn everywher clearli and
everywher irresist
i shall here endeavour to show how thi vast invent exert itself in
a manner superior to that of ani poet through all the main constitu
part of hi work as it is the great and peculiar characterist which
distinguish him from all other author
thi strong and rule faculti wa like a power star which in the
violenc of it cours drew all thing within it vortex it seem
not enough to have taken in the whole circl of art and the whole
compass of natur to suppli hi maxim and reflect all the inward
passion and affect of mankind to furnish hi charact and all
the outward form and imag of thing for hi descript but
want yet an ampler sphere to expati in he open a new and
boundless walk for hi imagin and creat a world for himself in
the invent of fabl that which aristotl call the soul of
poetri wa first breath into it by homer i shall begin with
consid him in hi part as it is natur the first and i speak
of it both as it mean the design of a poem and as it is taken for
fiction
fabl mai be divid into the probabl the allegor and the
marvel the probabl fabl is the recit of such action as
though thei did not happen yet might in the common cours of natur
or of such as though thei did becam fabl by the addit
episod and manner of tell them of thi sort is the main stori of
an epic poem the return of ulyss the settlement of the trojan in
itali or the like that of the iliad is the anger of achil the
most short and singl subject that ever wa chosen by ani poet yet
thi he ha suppli with a vaster varieti of incid and event and
crowd with a greater number of council speech battl and
episod of all kind than ar to be found even in those poem whose
scheme ar of the utmost latitud and irregular the action is
hurri on with the most vehement spirit and it whole durat
emploi not so much as fifti dai virgil for want of so warm a
geniu aid himself by take in a more extens subject as well as
a greater length of time and contract the design of both homer
poem into on which is yet but a fourth part as larg as hi the
other epic poet have us the same practic but gener carri it
so far as to superinduc a multipl of fabl destroi the uniti of
action and lose their reader in an unreason length of time nor
is it onli in the main design that thei have been unabl to add to hi
invent but thei have follow him in everi episod and part of
stori if he ha given a regular catalogu of an armi thei all draw up
their forc in the same order if he ha funer game for patroclu
virgil ha the same for anchis and statiu rather than omit them
destroi the uniti of hi action for those of archemoru if ulyss
visit the shade the nea of virgil and scipio of siliu ar sent
after him if he be detain from hi return by the allur of
calypso so is nea by dido and rinaldo by armida if achil be
absent from the armi on the score of a quarrel through half the poem
rinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account if he
give hi hero a suit of celesti armour virgil and tasso make the
same present to their virgil ha not onli observ thi close
imit of homer but where he had not led the wai suppli the
want from other greek author thu the stori of sinon and the take
of troi wa copi sai macrobiu almost word for word from
pisand as the love of dido and nea ar taken from those of medea
and jason in apolloniu and sever other in the same manner
to proce to the allegor fableif we reflect upon those
innumer knowledg those secret of natur and physic philosophi
which homer is gener suppos to have wrap up in hi allegori
what a new and ampl scene of wonder mai thi consider afford us
how fertil will that imagin appear which wa abl to cloth all
the properti of element the qualif of the mind the virtu
and vice in form and person and to introduc them into action
agreeabl to the natur of the thing thei shadow thi is a field in
which no succeed poet could disput with homer and whatev
commend have been allow them on thi head ar by no mean for
their invent in have enlarg hi circl but for their judgment
in have contract it for when the mode of learn chang in the
follow ag and scienc wa deliv in a plainer manner it then
becam as reason in the more modern poet to lai it asid as it
wa in homer to make us of it and perhap it wa no unhappi
circumst for virgil that there wa not in hi time that demand
upon him of so great an invent as might be capabl of furnish all
those allegor part of a poem
the marvel fabl includ whatev is supernatur and especi
the machin of the god if homer wa not the first who introduc the
deiti as herodotu imagin into the religion of greec he seem
the first who brought them into a system of machineri for poetri and
such a on as make it greatest import and digniti for we find
those author who have been offend at the liter notion of the god
constantli lai their accus against homer as the chief support
of it but whatev caus there might be to blame hi machin in a
philosoph or religi view thei ar so perfect in the poetic
that mankind have been ever sinc content to follow them none have
been abl to enlarg the sphere of poetri beyond the limit he ha set
everi attempt of thi natur ha prove unsuccess and after all the
variou chang of time and religion hi god continu to thi dai
the god of poetri
we come now to the charact of hi person and here we shall find no
author ha ever drawn so mani with so visibl and surpris a
varieti or given us such live and affect impress of them
everi on ha someth so singularli hi own that no painter could
have distinguish them more by their featur than the poet ha by
their manner noth can be more exact than the distinct he ha
observ in the differ degre of virtu and vice the singl
qualiti of courag is wonderfulli diversifi in the sever charact
of the iliad that of achil is furiou and intract that of
diomed forward yet listen to advic and subject to command that
of ajax is heavi and selfconfid of hector activ and vigil
the courag of agamemnon is inspirit by love of empir and ambit
that of menelau mix with soft and tender for hi peopl we
find in idomeneu a plain direct soldier in sarpedon a gallant and
gener on nor is thi judici and astonish divers to be
found onli in the princip qualiti which constitut the main of each
charact but even in the under part of it to which he take care to
give a tinctur of that princip on for exampl the main charact
of ulyss and nestor consist in wisdom and thei ar distinct in thi
that the wisdom of on is artifici and variou of the other natur
open and regular but thei have besid charact of courag and
thi qualiti also take a differ turn in each from the differ of
hi prudenc for on in the war depend still upon caution the other
upon experi it would be endless to produc instanc of these
kind the charact of virgil ar far from strike us in thi open
manner thei lie in a great degre hidden and undistinguish and
where thei ar mark most evid affect us not in proport to
those of homer hi charact of valour ar much alik even that of
turnu seem no wai peculiar but as it is in a superior degre and
we see noth that differ the courag of mnestheu from that of
sergestu cloanthu or the rest in like manner it mai be remark of
statiuss hero that an air of impetuos run through them all the
same horrid and savag courag appear in hi capaneu tydeu
hippomedon c thei have a pariti of charact which make them seem
brother of on famili i believ when the reader is led into thi
tract of reflect if he will pursu it through the epic and tragic
writer he will be convinc how infinit superior in thi point
the invent of homer wa to that of all other
the speech ar to be consid as thei flow from the charact
be perfect or defect as thei agre or disagre with the manner
of those who utter them as there is more varieti of charact in the
iliad so there is of speech than in ani other poem everyth in
it ha manner as aristotl express it that is everyth is
act or spoken it is hardli credibl in a work of such length how
small a number of line ar emploi in narrat in virgil the
dramat part is less in proport to the narr and the speech
often consist of gener reflect or thought which might be
equal just in ani person mouth upon the same occas as mani of
hi person have no appar charact so mani of hi speech escap
be appli and judg by the rule of proprieti we often think of
the author himself when we read virgil than when we ar engag in
homer all which ar the effect of a colder invent that interest
us less in the action describ homer make us hearer and virgil
leav us reader
if in the next place we take a view of the sentiment the same
presid faculti is emin in the sublim and spirit of hi
thought longinu ha given hi opinion that it wa in thi part
homer princip excel what were alon suffici to prove the
grandeur and excel of hi sentiment in gener is that thei
have so remark a pariti with those of the scriptur duport in hi
gnomologia homerica ha collect innumer instanc of thi sort
and it is with justic an excel modern writer allow that if
virgil ha not so mani thought that ar low and vulgar he ha not so
mani that ar sublim and nobl and that the roman author seldom rise
into veri astonish sentiment where he is not fire by the iliad
if we observ hi descript imag and simil we shall find the
invent still predomin to what els can we ascrib that vast
comprehens of imag of everi sort where we see each circumst
of art and individu of natur summon togeth by the extent and
fecund of hi imagin to which all thing in their variou
view present themselv in an instant and had their impress
taken off to perfect at a heat nai he not onli give us the full
prospect of thing but sever unexpect peculiar and side
view unobserv by ani painter but homer noth is so surpris as
the descript of hi battl which take up no less than half the
iliad and ar suppli with so vast a varieti of incid that no
on bear a like to anoth such differ kind of death that
no two hero ar wound in the same manner and such a profus of
nobl idea that everi battl rise abov the last in great
horror and confus it is certain there is not near that number of
imag and descript in ani epic poet though everi on ha assist
himself with a great quantiti out of him and it is evid of virgil
especi that he ha scarc ani comparison which ar not drawn from
hi master
if we descend from henc to the express we see the bright
imagin of homer shine out in the most enliven form of it we
acknowledg him the father of poetic diction the first who taught
that languag of the god to men hi express is like the
colour of some great master which discov itself to be laid on
boldli and execut with rapid it is inde the strongest and
most glow imagin and touch with the greatest spirit
aristotl had reason to sai he wa the onli poet who had found out
live word there ar in him more dare figur and metaphor than
in ani good author whatev an arrow is impati to be on the wing
a weapon thirst to drink the blood of an enemi and the like yet
hi express is never too big for the sens but justli great in
proport to it it is the sentiment that swell and fill out the
diction which rise with it and form itself about it for in the
same degre that a thought is warmer an express will be brighter
as that is more strong thi will becom more perspicu like glass
in the furnac which grow to a greater magnitud and refin to a
greater clear onli as the breath within is more power and the
heat more intens
to throw hi languag more out of prose homer seem to have affect
the compound epithet thi wa a sort of composit peculiarli proper
to poetri not onli as it heighten the diction but as it assist
and fill the number with greater sound and pomp and likewis
conduc in some measur to thicken the imag on thi last
consider i cannot but attribut these also to the fruit of
hi invent sinc as he ha manag them thei ar a sort of
supernumerari pictur of the person or thing to which thei were
join we see the motion of hector plume in the epithet
the landscap of mount neritu in that of
and so of other which particular imag could not have been insist
upon so long as to express them in a descript though but of a
singl line without divert the reader too much from the princip
action or figur as a metaphor is a short simil on of these
epithet is a short descript
lastli if we consid hi versif we shall be sensibl what a
share of prais is due to hi invent in that also he wa not
satisfi with hi languag as he found it settl in ani on part of
greec but search through it differ dialect with thi
particular view to beautifi and perfect hi number he consid
these as thei had a greater mixtur of vowel or conson and
accordingli emploi them as the vers requir either a greater
smooth or strength what he most affect wa the ionic which ha
a peculiar sweet from it never us contract and from it
custom of resolv the diphthong into two syllabl so as to make
the word open themselv with a more spread and sonor fluenci
with thi he mingl the attic contract the broader doric and the
feebler olic which often reject it aspir or take off it
accent and complet thi varieti by alter some letter with the
licenc of poetri thu hi measur instead of be fetter to hi
sens were alwai in readi to run along with the warmth of hi
raptur and even to give a further represent of hi notion in
the correspond of their sound to what thei signifi out of all
these he ha deriv that harmoni which make us confess he had not
onli the richest head but the finest ear in the world thi is so
great a truth that whoever will but consult the tune of hi vers
even without understand them with the same sort of dilig as we
daili see practis in the case of italian opera will find more
sweet varieti and majesti of sound than in ani other languag of
poetri the beauti of hi number is allow by the critic to be
copi but faintli by virgil himself though thei ar so just as to
ascrib it to the natur of the latin tongu inde the greek ha some
advantag both from the natur sound of it word and the turn and
cadenc of it vers which agre with the geniu of no other languag
virgil wa veri sensibl of thi and us the utmost dilig in
work up a more intract languag to whatsoev grace it wa
capabl of and in particular never fail to bring the sound of hi
line to a beauti agreement with it sens if the grecian poet ha
not been so frequent celebr on thi account as the roman the
onli reason is that fewer critic have understood on languag than
the other dionysiu of halicarnassu ha point out mani of our
author beauti in thi kind in hi treatis of the composit of
word it suffic at present to observ of hi number that thei flow
with so much eas as to make on imagin homer had no other care than
to transcrib as fast as the muse dictat and at the same time
with so much forc and inspirit vigour that thei awaken and rais
us like the sound of a trumpet thei roll along as a plenti river
alwai in motion and alwai full while we ar born awai by a tide of
vers the most rapid and yet the most smooth imagin
thu on whatev side we contempl homer what princip strike us
is hi invent it is that which form the charact of each part of
hi work and accordingli we find it to have made hi fabl more
extens and copiou than ani other hi manner more live and
strongli mark hi speech more affect and transport hi
sentiment more warm and sublim hi imag and descript more full
and anim hi express more rais and dare and hi number
more rapid and variou i hope in what ha been said of virgil with
regard to ani of these head i have no wai derog from hi
charact noth is more absurd or endless than the common method of
compar emin writer by an opposit of particular passag in
them and form a judgment from thenc of their merit upon the whole
we ought to have a certain knowledg of the princip charact and
distinguish excel of each it is in that we ar to consid
him and in proport to hi degre in that we ar to admir him no
author or man ever excel all the world in more than on faculti and
as homer ha done thi in invent virgil ha in judgment not that
we ar to think that homer want judgment becaus virgil had it in a
more emin degre or that virgil want invent becaus homer
possess a larger share of it each of these great author had more of
both than perhap ani man besid and ar onli said to have less in
comparison with on anoth homer wa the greater geniu virgil the
better artist in on we most admir the man in the other the work
homer hurri and transport us with a command impetuos virgil
lead us with an attract majesti homer scatter with a gener
profus virgil bestow with a care magnific homer like the
nile pour out hi rich with a boundless overflow virgil like a
river in it bank with a gentl and constant stream when we behold
their battl methink the two poet resembl the hero thei
celebr homer boundless and resistless as achil bear all
befor him and shine more and more as the tumult increas virgil
calmli dare like nea appear undisturb in the midst of the
action dispos all about him and conquer with tranquil and
when we look upon their machin homer seem like hi own jupit in
hi terror shake olympu scatter the lightn and fire the
heaven virgil like the same power in hi benevol counsel
with the god lai plan for empir and regularli order hi
whole creation
but after all it is with great part as with great virtu thei
natur border on some imperfect and it is often hard to
distinguish exactli where the virtu end or the fault begin as
prudenc mai sometim sink to suspicion so mai a great judgment
declin to cold and as magnanim mai run up to profus or
extravag so mai a great invent to redund or wild if we
look upon homer in thi view we shall perceiv the chief object
against him to proce from so nobl a caus as the excess of thi
faculti
among these we mai reckon some of hi marvel fiction upon which
so much critic ha been spent as surpass all the bound of
probabl perhap it mai be with great and superior soul as with
gigant bodi which exert themselv with unusu strength
exce what is commonli thought the due proport of part to becom
miracl in the whole and like the old hero of that make commit
someth near extravag amidst a seri of gloriou and inimit
perform thu homer ha hi speak hors and virgil hi
myrtl distil blood where the latter ha not so much as
contriv the easi intervent of a deiti to save the probabl
it is ow to the same vast invent that hi simil have been
thought too exuber and full of circumst the forc of thi
faculti is seen in noth more than in it inabl to confin
itself to that singl circumst upon which the comparison is
ground it run out into embellish of addit imag which
howev ar so manag as not to overpow the main on hi simil
ar like pictur where the princip figur ha not onli it
proport given agreeabl to the origin but is also set off with
occasion ornament and prospect the same will account for hi
manner of heap a number of comparison togeth in on breath when
hi fanci suggest to him at onc so mani variou and correspond
imag the reader will easili extend thi observ to more
object of the same kind
if there ar other which seem rather to charg him with a defect or
narrow of geniu than an excess of it those seem defect will
be found upon examin to proce wholli from the natur of the
time he live in such ar hi grosser represent of the god
and the viciou and imperfect manner of hi hero but i must here
speak a word of the latter as it is a point gener carri into
extrem both by the censur and defend of homer it must be a
strang partial to antiqu to think with madam dacier38 that
those time and manner ar so much the more excel as thei ar
more contrari to our who can be so prejud in their favour as to
magnifi the felic of those ag when a spirit of reveng and
cruelti join with the practic of rapin and robberi reign
through the world when no merci wa shown but for the sake of lucr
when the greatest princ were put to the sword and their wive and
daughter made slave and concubin on the other side i would not be
so delic as those modern critic who ar shock at the servil
offic and mean employ in which we sometim see the hero of
homer engag there is a pleasur in take a view of that simplic
in opposit to the luxuri of succeed ag in behold monarch
without their guard princ tend their flock and princess
draw water from the spring when we read homer we ought to reflect
that we ar read the most ancient author in the heathen world and
those who consid him in thi light will doubl their pleasur in the
perus of him let them think thei ar grow acquaint with nation
and peopl that ar now no more that thei ar step almost three
thousand year back into the remotest antiqu and entertain
themselv with a clear and surpris vision of thing nowher els to
be found the onli true mirror of that ancient world by thi mean
alon their greatest obstacl will vanish and what usual creat
their dislik will becom a satisfact
thi consider mai further serv to answer for the constant us of
the same epithet to hi god and hero such as the fardart
phbu the blueei palla the swiftfoot achil c
which some have censur as impertin and tedious repeat those
of the god depend upon the power and offic then believ to
belong to them and had contract a weight and vener from the
rite and solemn devot in which thei were us thei were a sort of
attribut with which it wa a matter of religion to salut them on all
occas and which it wa an irrever to omit as for the epithet
of great men mon boileau is of opinion that thei were in the natur
of surnam and repeat as such for the greek have no name
deriv from their father were oblig to add some other distinct
of each person either name hi parent expressli or hi place of
birth profess or the like as alexand the son of philip
herodotu of halicarnassu diogen the cynic c homer therefor
compli with the custom of hi countri us such distinct
addit as better agre with poetri and inde we have someth
parallel to these in modern time such as the name of harold
harefoot edmund ironsid edward longshank edward the black princ
c if yet thi be thought to account better for the proprieti than for
the repetit i shall add a further conjectur hesiod divid the
world into it differ ag ha place a fourth ag between the
brazen and the iron on of hero distinct from other men a divin
race who fought at thebe and troi ar call demigod and live by
the care of jupit in the island of the blessed39 now among the
divin honour which were paid them thei might have thi also in
common with the god not to be mention without the solemn of an
epithet and such as might be accept to them by celebr their
famili action or qualiti
what other cavil have been rais against homer ar such as hardli
deserv a repli but will yet be taken notic of as thei occur in the
cours of the work mani have been occas by an injudici
endeavour to exalt virgil which is much the same as if on should
think to rais the superstructur by undermin the foundat on
would imagin by the whole cours of their parallel that these
critic never so much as heard of homer have written first a
consider which whoever compar these two poet ought to have
alwai in hi ey some accus him for the same thing which thei
overlook or prais in the other as when thei prefer the fabl and
moral of the nei to those of the iliad for the same reason which
might set the odyssei abov the nei as that the hero is a wiser man
and the action of the on more benefici to hi countri than that of
the other or els thei blame him for not do what he never design
as becaus achil is not as good and perfect a princ as nea when
the veri moral of hi poem requir a contrari charact it is thu
that rapin judg in hi comparison of homer and virgil other select
those particular passag of homer which ar not so labour as some
that virgil drew out of them thi is the whole manag of scalig
in hi poetic other quarrel with what thei take for low and mean
express sometim through a fals delicaci and refin often
from an ignor of the grace of the origin and then triumph in
the awkward of their own translat thi is the conduct of
perrault in hi parallel lastli there ar other who pretend to
a fairer proceed distinguish between the person merit of homer
and that of hi work but when thei come to assign the caus of the
great reput of the iliad thei found it upon the ignor of hi
time and the prejudic of those that follow and in pursuanc of
thi principl thei make those accid such as the content of
the citi c to be the caus of hi fame which were in realiti
the consequ of hi merit the same might as well be said of
virgil or ani great author whose gener charact will infal
rais mani casual addit to their reput thi is the method of
mon de la mott who yet confess upon the whole that in whatev ag
homer had live he must have been the greatest poet of hi nation and
that he mai be said in hi sens to be the master even of those who
surpass him
in all these object we see noth that contradict hi titl to
the honour of the chief invent and as long as thi which is inde
the characterist of poetri itself remain unequal by hi
follow he still continu superior to them a cooler judgment mai
commit fewer fault and be more approv in the ey of on sort of
critic but that warmth of fanci will carri the loudest and most
univers applaus which hold the heart of a reader under the
strongest enchant homer not onli appear the inventor of poetri
but excel all the inventor of other art in thi that he ha
swallow up the honour of those who succeed him what he ha done
admit no increas it onli left room for contract or regul
he show all the stretch of fanci at onc and if he ha fail in
some of hi flight it wa but becaus he attempt everyth a work
of thi kind seem like a mighti tree which rise from the most
vigor seed is improv with industri flourish and produc the
finest fruit natur and art conspir to rais it pleasur and profit
join to make it valuabl and thei who find the justest fault have
onli said that a few branch which run luxuri through a rich of
natur might be lop into form to give it a more regular appear
have now spoken of the beauti and defect of the origin it
remain to treat of the translat with the same view to the chief
characterist as far as that is seen in the main part of the poem
such as the fabl manner and sentiment no translat can prejudic
it but by wil omiss or contract as it also break out in
everi particular imag descript and simil whoever lessen or too
much soften those take off from thi chief charact it is the
first grand duti of an interpret to give hi author entir and
unmaim and for the rest the diction and versif onli ar hi
proper provinc sinc these must be hi own but the other he is to
take as he find them
it should then be consid what method mai afford some equival in
our languag for the grace of these in the greek it is certain no
liter translat can be just to an excel origin in a superior
languag but it is a great mistak to imagin as mani have done that
a rash paraphras can make amend for thi gener defect which is no
less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient by deviat into the
modern manner of express if there be sometim a dark there
is often a light in antiqu which noth better preserv than a
version almost liter i know no liberti on ought to take but
those which ar necessari to transfus the spirit of the origin
and support the poetic style of the translat and i will
ventur to sai there have not been more men misl in former time by
a servil dull adher to the letter than have been delud in our
by a chimer insol hope of rais and improv their author
it is not to be doubt that the fire of the poem is what a translat
should princip regard as it is most like to expir in hi
manag howev it is hi safest wai to be content with preserv
thi to hi utmost in the whole without endeavour to be more than
he find hi author is in ani particular place it is a great secret
in write to know when to be plain and when poetic and figur
and it is what homer will teach us if we will but follow modestli in
hi footstep where hi diction is bold and lofti let us rais our
as high as we can but where hi is plain and humbl we ought not to
be deter from imit him by the fear of incur the censur of
a mere english critic noth that belong to homer seem to have been
more commonli mistaken than the just pitch of hi style some of hi
translat have swell into fustian in a proud confid of the
sublim other sunk into flat in a cold and timor notion of
simplic methink i see these differ follow of homer some
sweat and strain after him by violent leap and bound the
certain sign of fals mettl other slowli and servil creep in
hi train while the poet himself is all the time proceed with an
unaffect and equal majesti befor them howev of the two extrem
on could sooner pardon frenzi than frigid no author is to be
envi for such commend as he mai gain by that charact of
style which hi friend must agre togeth to call simplic and
the rest of the world will call dul there is a grace and
dignifi simplic as well as a bold and sordid on which differ as
much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven
it is on thing to be trick up and anoth not to be dress at all
simplic is the mean between ostent and rustic
thi pure and nobl simplic is nowher in such perfect as in the
scriptur and our author on mai affirm with all respect to the
inspir write that the divin spirit made us of no other word
but what were intellig and common to men at that time and in that
part of the world and as homer is the author nearest to those hi
style must of cours bear a greater resembl to the sacr book
than that of ani other writer thi consider togeth with what
ha been observ of the pariti of some of hi thought mai methink
induc a translat on the on hand to give in to sever of those
gener phrase and manner of express which have attain a
vener even in our languag from be us in the old testament
as on the other to avoid those which have been appropri to the
divin and in a manner consign to mysteri and religion
for a further preserv of thi air of simplic a particular care
should be taken to express with all plain those moral sentenc and
proverbi speech which ar so numer in thi poet thei have
someth vener and as i mai sai oracular in that unadorn
graviti and short with which thei ar deliv a grace which
would be utterli lost by endeavour to give them what we call a more
ingeni that is a more modern turn in the paraphras
perhap the mixtur of some grcism and old word after the manner of
milton if done without too much affect might not have an ill
effect in a version of thi particular work which most of ani other
seem to requir a vener antiqu cast but certainli the us of
modern term of war and govern such as platoon campaign junto
or the like into which some of hi translat have fallen cannot be
allow those onli except without which it is imposs to treat
the subject in ani live languag
there ar two peculiar in homer diction which ar a sort of
mark or mole by which everi common ey distinguish him at first
sight those who ar not hi greatest admir look upon them as
defect and those who ar seem pleas with them as beauti i
speak of hi compound epithet and of hi repetit mani of the
former cannot be done liter into english without destroi the
puriti of our languag i believ such should be retain as slide
easili of themselv into an english compound without violenc to the
ear or to the receiv rule of composit as well as those which
have receiv a sanction from the author of our best poet and ar
becom familiar through their us of them such as the
cloudcompel jove c as for the rest whenev ani can be as
fulli and significantli express in a singl word as in a compound
on the cours to be taken is obviou
some that cannot be so turn as to preserv their full imag by on
or two word mai have justic done them by circumlocut as the
epithet einosiphyllo to a mountain would appear littl or ridicul
translat liter leafshak but afford a majest idea in the
periphrasi the lofti mountain shake hi wave wood other that
admit of differ signif mai receiv an advantag from a
judici variat accord to the occas on which thei ar
introduc for exampl the epithet of apollo or
farshoot is capabl of two explic on liter in respect
of the dart and bow the ensign of that god the other allegor
with regard to the rai of the sun therefor in such place where
apollo is repres as a god in person i would us the former
interpret and where the effect of the sun ar describ i would
make choic of the latter upon the whole it will be necessari to
avoid that perpetu repetit of the same epithet which we find in
homer and which though it might be accommod as ha been alreadi
shown to the ear of those time is by no mean so to our but on
mai wait for opportun of place them where thei deriv an
addit beauti from the occas on which thei ar emploi and in
do thi properli a translat mai at onc show hi fanci and hi
judgment
as for homer repetit we mai divid them into three sort of
whole narrat and speech of singl sentenc and of on vers or
hemistitch i hope it is not imposs to have such a regard to these
as neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the on hand nor
to offend the reader too much on the other the repetit is not
ungrac in those speech where the digniti of the speaker render
it a sort of insol to alter hi word as in the messag from god
to men or from higher power to inferior in concern of state or
where the ceremoni of religion seem to requir it in the solemn
form of prayer oath or the like in other case i believ the
best rule is to be guid by the near or distanc at which the
repetit ar place in the origin when thei follow too close on
mai vari the express but it is a question whether a profess
translat be author to omit ani if thei be tediou the author is
to answer for it
it onli remain to speak of the versif homer as ha been said
is perpetu appli the sound to the sens and vari it on everi
new subject thi is inde on of the most exquisit beauti of
poetri and attain by veri few i onli know of homer emin for it
in the greek and virgil in the latin i am sensibl it is what mai
sometim happen by chanc when a writer is warm and fulli possess
of hi imag howev it mai reason be believ thei design
thi in whose vers it so manifestli appear in a superior degre to
all other few reader have the ear to be judg of it but those who
have will see i have endeavour at thi beauti
upon the whole i must confess myself utterli incap of do
justic to homer i attempt him in no other hope but that which on mai
entertain without much vaniti of give a more toler copi of him
than ani entir translat in vers ha yet done we have onli those
of chapman hobb and ogilbi chapman ha taken the advantag of an
immeasur length of vers notwithstand which there is scarc
ani paraphras more loos and rambl than hi he ha frequent
interpol of four or six line and i rememb on in the
thirteenth book of the odyssei ver 312 where he ha spun twenti
vers out of two he is often mistaken in so bold a manner that on
might think he deviat on purpos if he did not in other place of
hi note insist so much upon verbal trifl he appear to have had a
strong affect of extract new mean out of hi author
insomuch as to promis in hi rhyme prefac a poem of the mysteri
he had reveal in homer and perhap he endeavour to strain the
obviou sens to thi end hi express is involv in fustian a
fault for which he wa remark in hi origin write as in the
tragedi of bussi dambois c in a word the natur of the man mai
account for hi whole perform for he appear from hi prefac and
remark to have been of an arrog turn and an enthusiast in poetri
hi own boast of have finish half the iliad in less than fifteen
week show with what neglig hi version wa perform but that
which is to be allow him and which veri much contribut to cover
hi defect is a dare fieri spirit that anim hi translat
which is someth like what on might imagin homer himself would have
writ befor he arriv at year of discret
hobb ha given us a correct explan of the sens in gener but
for particular and circumst he continu lop them and often
omit the most beauti as for it be esteem a close
translat i doubt not mani have been led into that error by the
short of it which proce not from hi follow the origin
line by line but from the contract abov mention he sometim
omit whole simil and sentenc and is now and then guilti of
mistak into which no writer of hi learn could have fallen but
through careless hi poetri as well as ogilbi is too mean for
critic
it is a great loss to the poetic world that mr dryden did not live
to translat the iliad he ha left us onli the first book and a small
part of the sixth in which if he ha in some place not truli
interpret the sens or preserv the antiqu it ought to be
excus on account of the hast he wa oblig to write in he seem to
have had too much regard to chapman whose word he sometim copi
and ha unhappili follow him in passag where he wander from the
origin howev had he translat the whole work i would no more
have attempt homer after him than virgil hi version of whom
notwithstand some human error is the most nobl and spirit
translat i know in ani languag but the fate of great genius is
like that of great minist though thei ar confessedli the first in
the commonwealth of letter thei must be envi and calumni onli
for be at the head of it
that which in my opinion ought to be the endeavour of ani on who
translat homer is abov all thing to keep aliv that spirit and
fire which make hi chief charact in particular place where the
sens can bear ani doubt to follow the strongest and most poetic as
most agre with that charact to copi him in all the variat of
hi style and the differ modul of hi number to preserv
in the more activ or descript part a warmth and elev in the
more sedat or narr a plain and solemn in the speech a
ful and perspicu in the sentenc a short and graviti not
to neglect even the littl figur and turn on the word nor
sometim the veri cast of the period neither to omit nor confound
ani rite or custom of antiqu perhap too he ought to includ the
whole in a shorter compass than ha hitherto been done by ani
translat who ha toler preserv either the sens or poetri what
i would further recommend to him is to studi hi author rather from
hi own text than from ani commentari how learn soever or
whatev figur thei mai make in the estim of the world to
consid him attent in comparison with virgil abov all the
ancient and with milton abov all the modern next these the
archbishop of cambrai telemachu mai give him the truest idea of the
spirit and turn of our author and bossu admir treatis of the
epic poem the justest notion of hi design and conduct but after all
with whatev judgment and studi a man mai proce or with whatev
happi he mai perform such a work he must hope to pleas but a few
those onli who have at onc a tast of poetri and compet learn
for to satisfi such a want either is not in the natur of thi
undertak sinc a mere modern wit can like noth that is not
modern and a pedant noth that is not greek
what i have done is submit to the public from whose opinion i am
prepar to learn though i fear no judg so littl as our best poet
who ar most sensibl of the weight of thi task as for the worst
whatev thei shall pleas to sai thei mai give me some concern as
thei ar unhappi men but none as thei ar malign writer i wa
guid in thi translat by judgment veri differ from their and
by person for whom thei can have no kind if an old observ be
true that the strongest antipathi in the world is that of fool to men
of wit mr addison wa the first whose advic determin me to
undertak thi task who wa pleas to write to me upon that occas
in such term as i cannot repeat without vaniti i wa oblig to sir
richard steel for a veri earli recommend of my undertak to the
public dr swift promot my interest with that warmth with which he
alwai serv hi friend the human and frank of sir samuel
garth ar what i never knew want on ani occas i must also
acknowledg with infinit pleasur the mani friendli offic as well
as sincer critic of mr congrev who had led me the wai in
translat some part of homer i must add the name of mr row and
dr parnel though i shall take a further opportun of do justic
to the last whose good natur to give it a great panegyr is no
less extens than hi learn the favour of these gentlemen is not
entir undeserv by on who bear them so true an affect but
what can i sai of the honour so mani of the great have done me while
the first name of the ag appear as my subscrib and the most
distinguish patron and ornament of learn as my chief
encourag among these it is a particular pleasur to me to find
that my highest oblig ar to such who have done most honour to
the name of poet that hi grace the duke of buckingham wa not
displeas i should undertak the author to whom he ha given in hi
excel essai so complet a prais
read homer onc and you can read no more
for all book els appear so mean so poor
vers will seem prose but still persist to read
and homer will be all the book you need
that the earl of halifax wa on of the first to favour me of whom it
is hard to sai whether the advanc of the polit art is more ow
to hi generos or hi exampl that such a geniu as my lord
bolingbrok not more distinguish in the great scene of busi
than in all the us and entertain part of learn ha not
refus to be the critic of these sheet and the patron of their
writer and that the nobl author of the tragedi of heroic love ha
continu hi partial to me from my write pastor to my
attempt the iliad i cannot deni myself the pride of confess
that i have had the advantag not onli of their advic for the conduct
in gener but their correct of sever particular of thi
translat
i could sai a great deal of the pleasur of be distinguish by the
earl of carnarvon but it is almost absurd to particular ani on
gener action in a person whose whole life is a continu seri of
them mr stanhop the present secretari of state will pardon my
desir of have it known that he wa pleas to promot thi affair
the particular zeal of mr harcourt the son of the late lord
chancellor gave me a proof how much i am honour in a share of hi
friendship i must attribut to the same motiv that of sever other
of my friend to whom all acknowledg ar render unnecessari by
the privileg of a familiar correspond and i am satisfi i can
no wai better oblig men of their turn than by my silenc
in short i have found more patron than ever homer want he would
have thought himself happi to have met the same favour at athen that
ha been shown me by it learn rival the univers of oxford and i
can hardli envi him those pompou honour he receiv after death when
i reflect on the enjoy of so mani agreeabl oblig and easi
friendship which make the satisfact of life thi distinct is
the more to be acknowledg as it is shown to on whose pen ha never
gratifi the prejudic of particular parti or the vaniti of
particular men whatev the success mai prove i shall never repent of
an undertak in which i have experienc the candour and friendship
of so mani person of merit and in which i hope to pass some of those
year of youth that ar gener lost in a circl of folli after a
manner neither wholli unus to other nor disagre to myself

when troi proud glori in the dust shall lai

depriv of thee the heartless greek no more
shall dream of conquest on the hostil shore

curs be the fate that sent me to the field
without a warrior arm the spear and shield
if eer with life i quit the trojan plain
if eer i see my spous and sire again

broke by my hand shall feed the blaze flame
to whom the leader of the dardan race

on chief at least beneath thi arm shall die
so palla tell me and forbid to fly

he swung it round and gather strength to throw

embodi close the labour grecian train

so when the embattl cloud in dark arrai

when now the north hi boister rage ha spent
and peac sleep the liquid element

rest on the summit of the shade hill
till the mass scatter as the wind aris

these word he second with hi fly lanc
to meet whose point wa strong deicoon chanc

long had he fought the foremost in the field
but now the monarch lanc transpierc hi shield
hi shield too weak the furiou dart to stai
through hi broad belt the weapon forc it wai
the grisli wound dismissd hi soul to hell
hi arm around him rattl as he fell
then fierc nea brandish hi blade

whose sire diocleu wealthi brave and great
in wellbuilt pher held hi lofti seat152
sprung from alpheu plenteou stream that yield
increas of harvest to the pylian field
he got orsilochu diocleu he
and these descend in the third degre
too earli expert in the martial toil
in sabl ship thei left their nativ soil
to aveng atrid now untim slain
thei fell with glori on the phrygian plain
so two young mountain lion nurs with blood
in deep recess of the gloomi wood
rush fearless to the plain and uncontrolld
depopul the stall and wast the fold
till pierc at distanc from their nativ den
oerpow thei fall beneath the forc of men

he thu advanc nestor valiant son

struck with the thought should helen lord be slain
and all hi countri gloriou labour vain
alreadi met the threaten hero stand

in rushd antilochu hi aid to bring

these seen the dardan backward turnd hi cours
brave as he wa and shunnd unequ forc
the breathless bodi to the greek thei drew
then mix in combat and their toil renew
first pylmen great in battl bled
who sheath in brass the paphlagonian led

fixd in hi throat the javelin drank hi blood
the faith mydon as he turnd from fight

he groan in death and ponder sink to ground
deep drove hi helmet in the sand and there
the head stood fixd the quiver leg in air
till trampl flat beneath the courser feet
the youth victor mount hi empti seat
and bear the prize in triumph to the fleet
great hector saw and rage at the view
pour on the greek the trojan troop pursu
he fire hi host with anim cri
and bring along the furi of the ski
mar stern destroy and bellona dread
flame in the front and thunder at their head
thi swell the tumult and the rage of fight
that shake a spear that cast a dread light
where hector marchd the god of battl shine
now stormd befor him and now rage behind
tydid paus amidst hi full career
then first the hero manli breast knew fear

hi stroke thei second and avert our spear
behold where mar in mortal arm appear
retir then warrior but sedat and slow
retir but with your face to the foe
trust not too much your unavail might

now near the greek the black battalion drew
and first two leader valiant hector slew
hi forc anchialu and mnesth found
in everi art of gloriou war renownd
in the same car the chief to combat ride
and fought unit and unit di
struck at the sight the mighti ajax glow
with thirst of vengeanc and assault the foe
hi massi spear with matchless furi sent
through amphiu belt and heav belli went
amphiu apsu happi soil possessd
with herd abound and with treasur blessd
but fate resistless from hi countri led
the chief to perish at hi peopl head
shook with hi fall hi brazen armour rung
and fierc to seiz it conquer ajax sprung
around hi head an iron tempest raind
a wood of spear hi ampl shield sustaind
beneath on foot the yet warm corps he pressd
and drew hi javelin from the bleed breast
he could no more the shower dart deni

but you unworthi the high race you boast

now meet thy fate and by sarpedon slain
add on more ghost to pluto gloomi reign
he said both javelin at an instant flew
both struck both wound but sarpedon slew

minerva drive him on the lycian train
alastor croniu haliu strewd the plain

pari will not consent but offer to restor them her rich priam
send a herald to make thi offer and to demand a truce for burn

both breath slaughter both resolv in arm
as when to sailor labour through the main

o son of priam let thy faith ear

go forth persuas and a while engag

then dare the boldest of the hostil train
to mortal combat on the list plain
for not thi dai shall end thy gloriou date
the god have spoke it and their voic is fate
he said the warrior heard the word with joi
then with hi spear restraind the youth of troi

he said and rise high abov the field
whirld the long lanc against the sevenfold shield

drove through the trojan targ the knotti spear

while fear pale comrad of inglori flight199
and heavenbr horror on the grecian part

such variou passion urg the troubl host
great agamemnon griev abov the rest
superior sorrow swelld hi royal breast

to bid to council all the grecian peer
but bid in whisper these surround their chief
in solemn sad and majest grief
the king amidst the mourn circl rose
down hi wan cheek a brini torrent flow
so silent fountain from a rock tall head
in sabl stream softtrickl water shed
with more than vulgar grief he stood oppressd
word mixd with sigh thu burst from hi breast
ye son of greec partak your leader care
fellow in arm and princ of the war
of partial jove too justli we complain
and heavenli oracl believ in vain
a safe return wa promis to our toil

if i oppos thee princ thy wrath withhold
the law of council bid my tongu be bold
thou first and thou alon in field of fight
durst brand my courag and defam my might
nor from a friend the unkind reproach appeard
the greek stood wit all our armi heard
the god o chief from whom our honour spring
the god have made thee but by halv a king
thei gave thee sceptr and a wide command
thei gave dominion oer the sea and land
the noblest power that might the world control
thei gave thee nota brave and virtuou soul
is thi a gener voic that would suggest

confid in our want of worth he stand
and if we fly ti what our king command
go thou inglori from the embattl plain

king thou canst blame a bold but prudent youth
and blame even king with prais becaus with truth
and yet those year that sinc thy birth have run

then let me add what yet remain behind
a thought unfinishd in that gener mind
ag bid me speak nor shall the advic i bring
distast the peopl or offend the king
curs is the man and void of law and right
unworthi properti unworthi light

that wretch that monster who delight in war
whose lust is murder and whose horrid joi

between the trench and wall let guard remain
be that the duti of the young and bold
but thou o king to council call the old

let me my son an ancient fact unfold
a great exampl drawn from time of old
hear what our father were and what their prais
who conquerd their reveng in former dai

but found no peac from fierc althaea hate
althaea hate the unhappi warrior drew
whose luckless hand hi royal uncl slew
she beat the ground and calld the power beneath
on her own son to wreak her brother death
hell heard her curs from the realm profound
and the red fiend that walk the nightli round
in vain tolia her deliver wait
war shake her wall and thunder at her gate
she sent ambassador a chosen band
priest of the god and elder of the land
besought the chief to save the sink state
their prayer were urgent and their proffer great

but the rash youth prepar to scour the plain
across hi back the bend bow he flung
a wolf grei hide around hi shoulder hung
a ferret downi fur hi helmet line
and in hi hand a point javelin shine
then never to return he sought the shore
and trod the path hi feet must tread no more
scarc had he passd the steed and trojan throng
still bend forward as he cours along
when on the hollow wai the approach tread

o friend i hear some step of hostil feet

then rush behind him and prevent hi pace
but if too swift of foot he fli befor

with that thei steppd asid and stoopd their head

and from the herd still turn the fly prei
so fast and with such fear the trojan flew
so close so constant the bold greek pursu

when brave tydid stoppd a genrou thought

lest on the foe some forward greek advanc

then thu aloud whoeer thou art remain

to speak hi thought is everi freeman right

what coward counsel would thy mad move
against the word the will reveald of jove
the lead sign the irrevoc nod
and happi thunder of the favour god
these shall i slight and guid my waver mind

ye vagrant of the sky your wing extend

to right to left unheed take your wai
while i the dictat of high heaven obei
without a sign hi sword the brave man draw
and ask no omen but hi countri caus
but why shouldst thou suspect the war success
none fear it more as none promot it less
though all our chief amidst yon ship expir
trust thy own cowardic to escap their fire
troi and her son mai find a gener grave
but thou canst live for thou canst be a slave
yet should the fear that wari mind suggest
spread their cold poison through our soldier breast
my javelin can reveng so base a part

furiou he spoke and rush to the wall

so jove onc more mai drive their rout train

even power immens had found such battl hard
go thou my son the trembl greek alarm
shake my broad gi on thy activ arm
be godlik hector thy peculiar care
swell hi bold heart and urg hi strength to war
let ilion conquer till the achaian train
fly to their ship and hellespont again
then greec shall breath from toil the godhead said
hi will divin the son of jove obeyd
not half so swift the sail falcon fli
that drive a turtl through the liquid ski
as phbu shoot from the idaean brow

what blest immort with command breath
thu waken hector from the sleep of death
ha fame not told how while my trusti sword
bath greec in slaughter and her battl gore
the mighti ajax with a deadli blow
had almost sunk me to the shade below
even yet methink the glide ghost i spy

behold thy phbu shall hi arm emploi
phbu propiti still to thee and troi

and to the ship impel thy rapid hors
even i will make thy fieri courser wai
and drive the grecian headlong to the sea
thu to bold hector spoke the son of jove

when lo a lion shoot across the wai
thei fly at onc the chaser and the prei
so greec that late in conquer troop pursu
and markd their progress through the rank in blood
soon as thei see the furiou chief appear
forget to vanquish and consent to fear
thoa with grief observ hi dread cours
thoa the bravest of the tolian forc
skilld to direct the javelin distant flight
and bold to combat in the stand fight
not more in council fame for solid sens
than win word and heavenli eloqu
god what portent he cri these ey invad
lo hector rise from the stygian shade
we saw him late by thunder ajax killd
what god restor him to the fright field
and not content that half of greec lie slain
pour new destruct on her son again
he come not jove without thy power will
lo still he live pursu and conquer still
yet hear my counsel and hi worst withstand
the greek main bodi to the fleet command
but let the few whom brisker spirit warm
stand the first onset and provok the storm
thu point your arm and when such foe appear
fierc as he is let hector learn to fear
the warrior spoke the listen greek obei
thicken their rank and form a deep arrai
each ajax teucer merion gave command
the valiant leader of the cretan band
and marslik mege these the chief excit
approach the foe and meet the come fight
behind unnumberd multitud attend

full on the front the press trojan bear
and hector first came tower to the war
phbu himself the rush battl led

high held befor him jove enorm shield
portent shone and shade all the field
vulcan to jove the immort gift consignd
to scatter host and terrifi mankind
the greek expect the shock the clamour rise
from differ part and mingl in the ski
dire wa the hiss of dart by hero flung
and arrow leap from the bowstr sung
these drink the life of gener warrior slain
those guiltless fall and thirst for blood in vain
as long as phbu bore unmov the shield
sat doubt conquest hover oer the field
but when aloft he shake it in the ski
shout in their ear and lighten in their ey
deep horror seiz everi grecian breast
their forc is humbl and their fear confessd
so fli a herd of oxen scatterd wide
no swain to guard them and no dai to guid
when two fell lion from the mountain come
and spread the carnag through the shadi gloom
impend phbu pour around them fear
and troi and hector thunder in the rear
heap fall on heap the slaughter hector lead
first great arcesila then stichiu bleed

and on menestheu friend and fame compeer

thi sprang from phelu and the athenian led
but hapless medon from oleu came

though born of lawless love from home expelld
a banishd man in phylac he dwelld
pressd by the vengeanc of an angri wife
troi end at last hi labour and hi life

while these fly trembl other pant for breath
and oer the slaughter stalk gigant death
on rushd bold hector gloomi as the night

who dare but linger by thi hand he di

furiou he said the smart scourg resound

for he the god whose counsel uncontrolld

and in patroclu blood effac thy shame
perhap apollo shall thy arm succe

so spoke the inspir god then took hi flight
and plung amidst the tumult of the fight

while the proud victor thu hi fall derid
good heaven what activ feat yon artist show

then rush sudden on hi prostrat prize

thu for some slaughterd hind with equal rage
two lordli ruler of the wood engag
stung with fierc hunger each the prei invad
and echo roar rebellow through the shade
stern hector fasten on the warrior head
and by the foot patroclu drag the dead
while all around confus rage and fright
mix the contend host in mortal fight
so pent by hill the wild wind roar aloud
in the deep bosom of some gloomi wood
leav arm and tree aloft in air ar blown
the broad oak crackl and the sylvan groan
thi wai and that the rattl thicket bend
and the whole forest in on crash descend
not with less nois with less tumultu rage
in dread shock the mingl host engag
dart showerd on dart now round the carcas ring
now flight of arrow bound from the string
stone follow stone some clatter on the field
some hard and heavi shake the sound shield
but where the rise whirlwind cloud the plain
sunk in soft dust the mighti chief remain
and stretchd in death forget the guid rein
now flame from the zenith sol had driven
hi fervid orb through half the vault of heaven
while on each host with equal tempest fell
the shower dart and number sank to hell
but when hi even wheel oerhung the main
glad conquest rest on the grecian train
then from amidst the tumult and alarm
thei draw the conquerd cors and radiant arm
then rash patroclu with new furi glow
and breath slaughter pour amid the foe
thrice on the press like mar himself he flew
and thrice three hero at each onset slew
there end thy glori there the fate untwin
the last black remnant of so bright a line
apollo dread stop thy middl wai
death call and heaven allow no longer dai
for lo the god in duski cloud enshrin

high on hi chariot the cretan stood

desert of the god yet let us try

hi friend hi love patroclu is no more

oh king oh father hear my humbl prayer

with tear the hero spoke and at hi prayer

how skilld he wa in each oblig art

the youth warrior heard with silent woe
from hi fair ey the tear began to flow
big with the mighti grief he strove to sai
what sorrow dictat but no word found wai
to brave laodocu hi arm he flung
who near him wheel drove hi steed along
then ran the mourn messag to impart

swift fled the youth nor menelau stand
though sore distressd to aid the pylian band
but bid bold thrasymed those troop sustain

gone is antilochu the hero said
but hope not warrior for achil aid
though fierc hi rage unbound be hi woe

while thu aloft the hero cors thei bear

so the fierc courser as the chariot roll
tread down whole rank and crush out hero soul

the same dai continu the scene is on the bank and in the stream
of scamand
and now to xanthu glide stream thei drove
xanthu immort progeni of jove
the river here divid the fly train
part to the town fly divers oer the plain
where late their troop triumphant bore the fight
now chase and trembl in ignobl flight
these with a gather mist saturnia shroud
and roll behind the rout a heap of cloud
part plung into the stream old xanthu roar
the flash billow beat the whitend shore
with cri promiscu all the bank resound
and here and there in eddi whirl round
the flounc steed and shriek warrior drownd
as the scorchd locust from their field retir
while fast behind them run the blaze of fire
driven from the land befor the smoki cloud
the cluster legion rush into the flood
so plung in xanthu by achil forc
roar the resound surg with men and hors
hi bloodi lanc the hero cast asid
which spread tamarisk on the margin hide
then like a god the rapid billow brave

now down he plung now he whirl it round
deep groand the water with the dy sound

now tire with slaughter from the trojan band
twelv chosen youth he drag aliv to land
with their rich belt their captiv arm restrain
late their proud ornament but now their chain
these hi attend to the ship conveyd
sad victim destin to patroclu shade
then as onc more he plung amid the flood
the young lycaon in hi passag stood
the son of priam whom the hero hand
but late made captiv in hi father land
as from a sycamor hi sound steel
loppd the green arm to spoke a chariot wheel
to lemno isl he sold the royal slave
where jason son the price demand gave
but kind eetion touch on the shore
the ransomd princ to fair arisb bore
ten dai were past sinc in hi father reign
he felt the sweet of liberti again
the next that god whom men in vain withstand
give the same youth to the same conquer hand
now never to return and doomd to go
a sadder journei to the shade below
hi wellknown face when great achil ei

with wild affright and droppd upon the field
hi useless lanc and unavail shield
as trembl pant from the stream he fled
and knockd hi falter knee the hero said
ye mighti god what wonder strike my view
is it in vain our conquer arm subdu
sure i shall see yon heap of trojan killd
rise from the shade and brave me on the field
as now the captiv whom so late i bound
and sold to lemno stalk on trojan ground
not him the sea unmeasur deep detain
that bar such number from their nativ plain
lo he return try then my fly spear
try if the grave can hold the wander
if earth at length thi activ princ can seiz
earth whose strong grasp ha held down hercul
thu while he spoke the trojan pale with fear
approachd and sought hi knee with suppliant tear
loth as he wa to yield hi youth breath
and hi soul shiver at the approach of death
achil rais the spear prepar to wound
he kissd hi feet extend on the ground
and while abov the spear suspend stood

while thu these melt word attempt hi heart

for ah on spear shall drink each brother gore
and i succe to slaughterd polydor
how from that arm of terror shall i fly
some demon urg ti my doom to die
if ever yet soft piti touchd thy mind
ah think not me too much of hector kind
not the same mother gave thy suppliant breath

these word attend with a shower of tear
the youth addressd to unrel ear

he far thy better wa foredoomd to die
and thou dost thou bewail mortal
seest thou not me whom natur gift adorn
sprung from a hero from a goddess born
the dai shall come which noth can avert
when by the spear the arrow or the dart

the faint stripl sank befor the stroke
hi hand forgot it grasp and left the spear
while all hi trembl frame confessd hi fear
sudden achil hi broad sword displayd
and buri in hi neck the reek blade
prone fell the youth and pant on the land
the gush purpl dy the thirsti sand

and thu insult him float on the wave
lie there lycaon let the fish surround
thy bloat corps and suck thy gori wound
there no sad mother shall thy funer weep
but swift scamand roll thee to the deep

these boast word provok the rage god

on him achil rushd he fearless stood
and shook two spear advanc from the flood
the flood impelld him on pelid head
to aveng hi water choke with heap of dead

and on hi foe with doubl furi flew
the foe thrice tuggd and shook the root wood
repuls of hi might the weapon stood
the fourth he tri to break the spear in vain
bent as he stand he tumbl to the plain
hi belli opend with a ghastli wound
the reek entrail pour upon the ground
beneath the hero feet he pant li
and hi ey darken and hi spirit fli
while the proud victor thu triumph said
hi radiant armour tear from the dead
so end thy glori such the fate thei prove
who strive presumptu with the son of jove
sprung from a river didst thou boast thy line
but great saturniu is the sourc of mine
how durst thou vaunt thy wateri progeni
of peleu acu and jove am i
the race of these superior far to those
as he that thunder to the stream that flow
what river can scamand might have shown
but jove he dread nor war against hi son
even achel might contend in vain
and all the roar billow of the main
the etern ocean from whose fountain flow
the sea the river and the spring below
the thunder voic of jove abhor to hear
and in hi deep abyss shake with fear
he said then from the bank hi javelin tore
and left the breathless warrior in hi gore
the float tide the bloodi carcas lave
and beat against it wave succeed wave
till rolld between the bank it li the food
of curl eel and fish of the flood
all scatterd round the stream their mightiest slain

and number more hi lanc had plung to hell
but from the bottom of hi gulf profound
scamand spoke the shore returnd the sound
o first of mortal for the god ar thine
in valour matchless and in forc divin
if jove have given thee everi trojan head
ti not on me thy rage should heap the dead
see my choke stream no more their cours can keep

turn then impetu from our injur flood
content thy slaughter could amaz a god

o sacr stream thy word we shall obei

not till within her tower the perjur train
shall pant and trembl at our arm again
not till proud hector guardian of her wall

he said and drove with furi on the foe
then to the godhead of the silver bow
the yellow flood began o son of jove

then rise in hi rage abov the shore

while all befor the billow rang on high

leapd from the channel and regaind the land
then blackend the wild wave the murmur rose
the god pursu a huger billow throw

and gather fast and murmur at hi heel
so when a peasant to hi garden bring

and call the flood from high to bless hi bower
and feed with pregnant stream the plant and flower

and make my futur life the sport of fate

but most of theti must her son complain
by phbu dart she prophesi my fall

wide oer the plain he pour the boundless blaze

so lookd the field so whitend wa the ground
while vulcan breath the fieri blast around

while these by juno will the strife resign

then had the greek etern prais acquir

what shall i fly thi terror of the plain
like other fly and be like other slain
vain hope to shun him by the selfsam road
yon line of slaughterd trojan late trod

what if thei passd me to the trojan wall
while i declin to yonder path that lead

thu humbl in the dust the pensiv train
through the sad citi mournd her hero slain
the bodi soild with dust and black with gore

the grecian seek their ship and clear the strand
all but the martial myrmidonian band
these yet assembl great achil hold
and the stern purpos of hi mind unfold
not yet my brave companion of the war
releas your smoke courser from the car
but with hi chariot each in order led
perform due honour to patroclu dead
er yet from rest or food we seek relief
some rite remain to glut our rage of grief
the troop obeyd and thrice in order led281
achil first their courser round the dead
and thrice their sorrow and lament renew
tear bath their arm and tear the sand bedew
for such a warrior theti aid their woe
melt their strong heart and bid their ey to flow
but chief pelid thicksucceed sigh
burst from hi heart and torrent from hi ey

on hi dead friend cold breast and thu he said
all hail patroclu let thy honourd ghost

behold achil promis is complet
the bloodi hector stretchd befor thy feet
lo to the dog hi carcas i resign
and twelv sad victim of the trojan line
sacr to vengeanc instant shall expir
their live effus around thy funer pyre
gloomi he said and horribl to view
befor the bier the bleed hector threw
prone on the dust the myrmidon around
unbrac their armour and the steed unbound
all to achil sabl ship repair
frequent and full the genial feast to share
now from the wellf swine black smoke aspir
the bristli victim hiss oer the fire
the huge ox bellow fall with feebler cri
expir the goat the sheep in silenc di
around the hero prostrat bodi flowd
in on promiscu stream the reek blood
and now a band of argiv monarch bring
the gloriou victor to the king of king
from hi dead friend the pensiv warrior went
with step unwil to the regal tent
the attend herald as by offic bound
with kindl flame the tripodvas surround
to cleans hi conquer hand from hostil gore
thei urg in vain the chief refus and swore282
no drop shall touch me by almighti jove
the first and greatest of the god abov
till on the pyre i place thee till i rear
the grassi mound and clip thy sacr hair
some eas at least those piou rite mai give
and sooth my sorrow while i bear to live
howeer reluct as i am i stai
and share your feast but with the dawn of dai
o king of men it claim thy royal care
that greec the warrior funer pile prepar
and bid the forest fall such rite ar paid
to hero slumber in etern shade
then when hi earthli part shall mount in fire
let the leagu squadron to their post retir
he spoke thei hear him and the word obei
the rage of hunger and of thirst allai
then eas in sleep the labour of the dai
but great pelid stretchd along the shore
where dashd on rock the broken billow roar
li inli groan while on either hand
the martial myrmidon confusedli stand
along the grass hi languid member fall
tire with hi chase around the trojan wall
hushd by the murmur of the roll deep
at length he sink in the soft arm of sleep
when lo the shade befor hi close ey
of sad patroclu rose or seemd to rise
in the same robe he live wore he came
in statur voic and pleas look the same
the form familiar hoverd oer hi head
and sleep achil thu the phantom said
sleep my achil hi patroclu dead
live i seemd hi dearest tenderest care
but now forgot i wander in the air
let my pale cors the rite of burial know
and give me entranc in the realm below
till then the spirit find no restingplac
but here and there the unbodi spectr chase
the vagrant dead around the dark abod
forbid to cross the irrem flood
now give thy hand for to the farther shore
when onc we pass the soul return no more
when onc the last funer flame ascend
no more shall meet achil and hi friend
no more our thought to those we love make known
or quit the dearest to convers alon
me fate ha severd from the son of earth
the fate foredoomd that wait from my birth
thee too it wait befor the trojan wall
even great and godlik thou art doomd to fall
hear then and as in fate and love we join
ah suffer that my bone mai rest with thine
togeth have we live togeth bred
on hous receiv us and on tabl fed
that golden urn thy goddessmoth gave
mai mix our ash in on common grave
and is it thou he answer to my sight283
onc more returnst thou from the realm of night
o more than brother think each offic paid
whateer can rest a discont shade
but grant on last embrac unhappi boi
afford at least that melancholi joi
he said and with hi long arm essayd
in vain to grasp the visionari shade
like a thin smoke he see the spirit fly284
and hear a feebl lament cry
confus he wake amaz break the band
of golden sleep and start from the sand
pensiv he muse with uplift hand
ti true ti certain man though dead retain
part of himself the immort mind remain
the form subsist without the bodi aid
aerial semblanc and an empti shade
thi night my friend so late in battl lost
stood at my side a pensiv plaintiv ghost
even now familiar as in life he came
ala how differ yet how like the same
thu while he spoke each ey grew big with tear
and now the rosyfingerd morn appear

but agamemnon as the rite demand
with mule and waggon send a chosen band

on all side round the forest hurl her oak
headlong deep echo groan the thicket brown
then rustl crackl crash thunder down
the wood the grecian cleav prepar to burn
and the slow mule the same rough road return
the sturdi woodmen equal burden bore
such charg wa given them to the sandi shore
there on the spot which great achil showd
thei eas their shoulder and dispos the load
circl around the place where time to come
shall view patroclu and achil tomb
the hero bid hi martial troop appear

and now the sun had set upon their woe
but to the king of men thu spoke the chief

but fast besid achil stood in prayer

and heap on heap the cloud ar tossd befor
