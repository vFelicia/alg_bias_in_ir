a woman wa there with raiment white
to bath and spread in the warm sunlight
and she told a tale to me there by the river
the tale of the queen and her evil dai
how ail beyond allay
within she hath bow her head
and with shadow of silken raiment
the bright brown hair bespread
for three long dai she hath lain forlorn
her lip untaint of flesh or corn
for that secret sorrow beyond allay
that steer to the far sad shore of the dead

in the forest on half sink on a bed
of deep pine greeneri on with careless head
amid the fallen oak leav all most cold
in puritynot as thy tale wa told
of winecup and wild music and the chase
for love amid the forest loneli
then rose the queen agv suddenli
amid her band and gave the god wild cry
awak ye bacchan i hear the sound
of hornd kine awak yethen all round
alert the warm sleep fallen from their ey
a marvel of swift rank i saw them rise
dame young and old and gentl maid unw
among them oer their shoulder first thei shed
their tress and caught up the fallen fold
of mantl where some clasp had loosen hold
and girt the dappl fawnskin in with long
quick snake that hiss and writh with quiver tongu
and on a young fawn held and on a wild
wolf cub and fed them with white milk and smile
in love young mother with a mother breast
and babe at home forgotten then thei press
wreath ivi round their brow and oaken sprai
and flower bryoni and on would rais
her wand and smite the rock and straight a jet
of quick bright water came anoth set
her thyrsu in the bosom earth and there
wa red wine that the god sent up to her
a darkl fountain and if ani lip
sought whiter draught with dip fingertip
thei press the sod and gush from the ground
came spring of milk and reedwand ivycrown
ran with sweet honei drop by dropo king
hadst thou been there as i and seen thi thing
with prayer and most high wonder hadst thou gone
to ador thi god whom now thou railst upon
howbeit the kinewarden and shepherd straight
came to on place amaz and held debat
and on be there who walk the street and scan
the wai of speech took lead of them whose hand
knew but the slow soil and the solemn hill
and flatter spoke and ask is it your will
master we stai the mother of the king
agv from her lawless worship
and win us royal thanksand thi seem good
to all and through the branch underwood
we hid us cower in the leav and there
through the appoint hour thei made their prayer
and worship of the wand with on accord

and worship with them and the wild thing knelt
and ramp and glori and the wilder
wa fill with move voic and dim stress

the queen herself pass danc and i rose
and sprang to seiz her but she turn her face
upon me ho my rover of the chase
my wild white hound we ar hunt up each rod
and follow follow for our lord and god
thereat for fear thei tear us all we fled
amaz and on with hand unweapond
thei swept toward our herd that brows the green
hill grass great udder kine then hadst thou seen
bellow in swordlik hand that cleav and tear
a live steer riven asund and the air
toss with rent rib or limb of cloven tread
and flesh upon the branch and a red
rain from the deep green pine yea bull of pride
horn swift to rage were front and asid
flung stumbl by those multitudin hand
drag pitilessli and swifter were the band
of garbd flesh and bone unbound withal
than on thy royal ey the lid mai fall
then on like bird by their own speed upborn
thei swept toward the plain of wave corn
that lie besid asopu bank and bring
to thebe the rich fruit of her harvest
on hysia and erythra that lie nurs
amid kithaeron bower rock thei burst
destroi as a foeman armi come
thei caught up littl children from their home
high on their shoulder babe unheld that swai
and laugh and fell not all a wreck thei made
yea bronz and iron did shatter and in plai
struck hither and thither yet no wound had thei
caught fire from out the hearth yea carri hot
flame in their tress and were scorchd not
the villag folk in wrath took spear and sword
and turn upon the baccha then dread lord
the wonder wa for spear nor barbd brand
could scath nor touch the damsel but the wand
the soft and wreathd wand their white hand sped
blast those men and quell them and thei fled
dizzili sure some god wa in these thing
and the holi women back to those strang spring
return that god had sent them when the dai
dawn on the upper height and wash awai
the stain of battl and those girdl snake
hiss out to lap the waterdrop from cheek

shall i feel the dew on my throat and the stream
of wind in my hair shall our white feet gleam
in the dim expans
oh feet of a fawn to the greenwood fled
alon in the grass and the loveli
leap of the hunt no more in dread
beyond the snare and the deadli press
yet a voic still in the distanc sound
a voic and a fear and a hast of hound
o wildli labour fierc fleet
onward yet by river and glen
is it joi or terror ye stormswift feet
to the dear lone land untroubl of men
where no voic sound and amid the shadowi green
the littl thing of the woodland live unseen
what els is wisdom what of man endeavour
or god high grace so love and so great
to stand from fear set free to breath and wait
to hold a hand uplift over hate
and shall not loveli be love for ever

yet failest never

on them that dream doth hi judgment wait
dream of the proud man make great

look not to heaven for all is vain
the puls of the heart the plot of the brain
that striveth beyond the law that live
and is thy fate so much to give
is it so hard a thing to see
that the spirit of god whateer it be
the law that abid and chang not ag long
the etern and naturebornthes thing be strong
what els is wisdom what of man endeavour
or god high grace so love and so great
to stand from fear set free to breath and wait
