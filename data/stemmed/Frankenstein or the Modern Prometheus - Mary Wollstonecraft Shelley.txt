you will rejoic to hear that no disast ha accompani the
commenc of an enterpris which you have regard with such evil
forebod i arriv here yesterdai and my first task is to assur
my dear sister of my welfar and increas confid in the success
of my undertak
i am alreadi far north of london and as i walk in the street of
petersburgh i feel a cold northern breez plai upon my cheek which
brace my nerv and fill me with delight do you understand thi
feel thi breez which ha travel from the region toward
which i am advanc give me a foretast of those ici clime
inspirit by thi wind of promis my daydream becom more fervent
and vivid i try in vain to be persuad that the pole is the seat of
frost and desol it ever present itself to my imagin as the
region of beauti and delight there margaret the sun is for ever
visibl it broad disk just skirt the horizon and diffus a
perpetu splendour therefor with your leav my sister i will put
some trust in preced navigatorsther snow and frost ar banish
and sail over a calm sea we mai be waft to a land surpass in
wonder and in beauti everi region hitherto discov on the habit
globe it product and featur mai be without exampl as the
phenomena of the heavenli bodi undoubtedli ar in those undiscov
solitud what mai not be expect in a countri of etern light i
mai there discov the wondrou power which attract the needl and mai
regul a thousand celesti observ that requir onli thi
voyag to render their seem eccentr consist for ever i
shall satiat my ardent curios with the sight of a part of the world
never befor visit and mai tread a land never befor imprint by
the foot of man these ar my entic and thei ar suffici to
conquer all fear of danger or death and to induc me to commenc thi
labori voyag with the joi a child feel when he embark in a littl
boat with hi holidai mate on an expedit of discoveri up hi
nativ river but suppos all these conjectur to be fals you
cannot contest the inestim benefit which i shall confer on all
mankind to the last gener by discov a passag near the pole
to those countri to reach which at present so mani month ar
requisit or by ascertain the secret of the magnet which if at
all possibl can onli be effect by an undertak such as mine
these reflect have dispel the agit with which i began my
letter and i feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elev me
to heaven for noth contribut so much to tranquillis the mind as
a steadi purposea point on which the soul mai fix it intellectu
ey thi expedit ha been the favourit dream of my earli year i
have read with ardour the account of the variou voyag which have
been made in the prospect of arriv at the north pacif ocean
through the sea which surround the pole you mai rememb that a
histori of all the voyag made for purpos of discoveri compos the
whole of our good uncl thoma librari my educ wa neglect
yet i wa passion fond of read these volum were my studi
dai and night and my familiar with them increas that regret which
i had felt as a child on learn that my father dy injunct
had forbidden my uncl to allow me to embark in a seafar life
these vision fade when i perus for the first time those poet
whose effus entranc my soul and lift it to heaven i also
becam a poet and for on year live in a paradis of my own creation
i imagin that i also might obtain a nich in the templ where the
name of homer and shakespear ar consecr you ar well
acquaint with my failur and how heavili i bore the disappoint
but just at that time i inherit the fortun of my cousin and my
thought were turn into the channel of their earlier bent
six year have pass sinc i resolv on my present undertak i
can even now rememb the hour from which i dedic myself to thi
great enterpris i commenc by inur my bodi to hardship i
accompani the whalefish on sever expedit to the north sea
i voluntarili endur cold famin thirst and want of sleep i often
work harder than the common sailor dure the dai and devot my
night to the studi of mathemat the theori of medicin and those
branch of physic scienc from which a naval adventur might deriv
the greatest practic advantag twice i actual hire myself as an
underm in a greenland whaler and acquit myself to admir i
must own i felt a littl proud when my captain offer me the second
digniti in the vessel and entreat me to remain with the greatest
earnest so valuabl did he consid my servic
and now dear margaret do i not deserv to accomplish some great purpos
my life might have been pass in eas and luxuri but i prefer glori to
everi entic that wealth place in my path oh that some encourag
voic would answer in the affirm my courag and my resolut is
firm but my hope fluctuat and my spirit ar often depress i am
about to proce on a long and difficult voyag the emerg of which
will demand all my fortitud i am requir not onli to rais the spirit
of other but sometim to sustain my own when their ar fail
thi is the most favour period for travel in russia thei fly
quickli over the snow in their sledg the motion is pleasant and in
my opinion far more agreeabl than that of an english stagecoach the
cold is not excess if you ar wrap in fursa dress which i have
alreadi adopt for there is a great differ between walk the
deck and remain seat motionless for hour when no exercis
prevent the blood from actual freez in your vein i have no
ambit to lose my life on the postroad between st petersburgh and
archangel
i shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three week and my
intent is to hire a ship there which can easili be done by pai the
insur for the owner and to engag as mani sailor as i think necessari
among those who ar accustom to the whalefish i do not intend to
sail until the month of june and when shall i return ah dear sister how
can i answer thi question if i succe mani mani month perhap year
will pass befor you and i mai meet if i fail you will see me again soon
or never
farewel my dear excel margaret heaven shower down bless on you
and save me that i mai again and again testifi my gratitud for all your
love and kind
your affection brother

how slowli the time pass here encompass as i am by frost and snow
yet a second step is taken toward my enterpris i have hire a
vessel and am occupi in collect my sailor those whom i have
alreadi engag appear to be men on whom i can depend and ar certainli
possess of dauntless courag
but i have on want which i have never yet been abl to satisfi and the
absenc of the object of which i now feel as a most sever evil i have no
friend margaret when i am glow with the enthusiasm of success there
will be none to particip my joi if i am assail by disappoint no
on will endeavour to sustain me in deject i shall commit my thought
to paper it is true but that is a poor medium for the commun of
feel i desir the compani of a man who could sympathis with me whose
ey would repli to mine you mai deem me romant my dear sister but i
bitterli feel the want of a friend i have no on near me gentl yet
courag possess of a cultiv as well as of a capaci mind whose
tast ar like my own to approv or amend my plan how would such a
friend repair the fault of your poor brother i am too ardent in execut
and too impati of difficulti but it is a still greater evil to me
that i am selfeduc for the first fourteen year of my life i ran wild
on a common and read noth but our uncl thoma book of voyag
at that ag i becam acquaint with the celebr poet of our own
countri but it wa onli when it had ceas to be in my power to deriv it
most import benefit from such a convict that i perceiv the
necess of becom acquaint with more languag than that of my nativ
countri now i am twentyeight and am in realiti more illiter than mani
schoolboi of fifteen it is true that i have thought more and that my
daydream ar more extend and magnific but thei want as the painter
call it keep and i greatli need a friend who would have sens
enough not to despis me as romant and affect enough for me to
endeavour to regul my mind
well these ar useless complaint i shall certainli find no friend on the
wide ocean nor even here in archangel among merchant and seamen yet
some feel unal to the dross of human natur beat even in these
rug bosom my lieuten for instanc is a man of wonder courag
and enterpris he is madli desir of glori or rather to word my phrase
more characterist of advanc in hi profess he is an
englishman and in the midst of nation and profession prejudic
unsoften by cultiv retain some of the noblest endow of
human i first becam acquaint with him on board a whale vessel
find that he wa unemploi in thi citi i easili engag him to assist
in my enterpris
the master is a person of an excel disposit and is remark in the
ship for hi gentl and the mild of hi disciplin thi
circumst ad to hi wellknown integr and dauntless courag made
me veri desir to engag him a youth pass in solitud my best year
spent under your gentl and feminin fosterag ha so refin the
groundwork of my charact that i cannot overcom an intens distast to
the usual brutal exercis on board ship i have never believ it to be
necessari and when i heard of a marin equal note for hi kindli
of heart and the respect and obedi paid to him by hi crew i felt
myself peculiarli fortun in be abl to secur hi servic i heard
of him first in rather a romant manner from a ladi who ow to him the
happi of her life thi briefli is hi stori some year ago he love
a young russian ladi of moder fortun and have amass a consider
sum in prizemonei the father of the girl consent to the match he saw
hi mistress onc befor the destin ceremoni but she wa bath in
tear and throw herself at hi feet entreat him to spare her
confess at the same time that she love anoth but that he wa poor
and that her father would never consent to the union my gener friend
reassur the suppliant and on be inform of the name of her lover
instantli abandon hi pursuit he had alreadi bought a farm with hi
monei on which he had design to pass the remaind of hi life but he
bestow the whole on hi rival togeth with the remain of hi
prizemonei to purchas stock and then himself solicit the young
woman father to consent to her marriag with her lover but the old
man decidedli refus think himself bound in honour to my friend who
when he found the father inexor quit hi countri nor return
until he heard that hi former mistress wa marri accord to her
inclin what a nobl fellow you will exclaim he is
so but then he is wholli uneduc he is as silent as a turk and a kind
of ignor careless attend him which while it render hi conduct
the more astonish detract from the interest and sympathi which
otherwis he would command
yet do not suppos becaus i complain a littl or becaus i can
conceiv a consol for my toil which i mai never know that i am
waver in my resolut those ar as fix as fate and my voyag
is onli now delai until the weather shall permit my embark the
winter ha been dreadfulli sever but the spring promis well and it
is consid as a remark earli season so that perhap i mai sail
sooner than i expect i shall do noth rashli you know me

so strang an accid ha happen to us that i cannot forbear
record it although it is veri probabl that you will see me befor
these paper can come into your possess
last mondai juli 31st we were nearli surround by ic which close
in the ship on all side scarc leav her the searoom in which
she float our situat wa somewhat danger especi as we
were compass round by a veri thick fog we accordingli lai to
hope that some chang would take place in the atmospher and weather
about two oclock the mist clear awai and we beheld stretch out
in everi direct vast and irregular plain of ic which seem to
have no end some of my comrad groan and my own mind began to
grow watch with anxiou thought when a strang sight suddenli
attract our attent and divert our solicitud from our own
situat we perceiv a low carriag fix on a sledg and drawn by
dog pass on toward the north at the distanc of half a mile a
be which had the shape of a man but appar of gigant statur
sat in the sledg and guid the dog we watch the rapid progress
of the travel with our telescop until he wa lost among the
distant inequ of the ic
thi appear excit our unqualifi wonder we were as we believ
mani hundr mile from ani land but thi apparit seem to denot that
it wa not in realiti so distant as we had suppos shut in howev by
ic it wa imposs to follow hi track which we had observ with the
greatest attent
about two hour after thi occurr we heard the ground sea and befor
night the ic broke and freed our ship we howev lai to until the
morn fear to encount in the dark those larg loos mass which
float about after the break up of the ic i profit of thi time to
rest for a few hour
in the morn howev as soon as it wa light i went upon deck and
found all the sailor busi on on side of the vessel appar
talk to someon in the sea it wa in fact a sledg like that we
had seen befor which had drift toward us in the night on a larg
fragment of ic onli on dog remain aliv but there wa a human
be within it whom the sailor were persuad to enter the vessel
he wa not as the other travel seem to be a savag inhabit of
some undiscov island but a european when i appear on deck the
master said here is our captain and he will not allow you to perish
on the open sea
on perceiv me the stranger address me in english although with a
foreign accent befor i come on board your vessel said he
will you have the kind to inform me whither you ar bound
you mai conceiv my astonish on hear such a question address
to me from a man on the brink of destruct and to whom i should have
suppos that my vessel would have been a resourc which he would not
have exchang for the most preciou wealth the earth can afford i
repli howev that we were on a voyag of discoveri toward the
northern pole
upon hear thi he appear satisfi and consent to come on board
good god margaret if you had seen the man who thu capitul for
hi safeti your surpris would have been boundless hi limb were
nearli frozen and hi bodi dreadfulli emaci by fatigu and
suffer i never saw a man in so wretch a condit we attempt
to carri him into the cabin but as soon as he had quit the fresh
air he faint we accordingli brought him back to the deck and
restor him to anim by rub him with brandi and forc him to
swallow a small quantiti as soon as he show sign of life we
wrap him up in blanket and place him near the chimnei of the
kitchen stove by slow degre he recov and at a littl soup
which restor him wonderfulli
two dai pass in thi manner befor he wa abl to speak and i often
fear that hi suffer had depriv him of understand when he
had in some measur recov i remov him to my own cabin and
attend on him as much as my duti would permit i never saw a more
interest creatur hi ey have gener an express of
wild and even mad but there ar moment when if anyon
perform an act of kind toward him or doe him ani the most
trifl servic hi whole counten is light up as it were with
a beam of benevol and sweet that i never saw equal but he
is gener melancholi and despair and sometim he gnash hi
teeth as if impati of the weight of woe that oppress him
when my guest wa a littl recov i had great troubl to keep off
the men who wish to ask him a thousand question but i would not
allow him to be torment by their idl curios in a state of bodi
and mind whose restor evid depend upon entir repos
onc howev the lieuten ask why he had come so far upon the ic
in so strang a vehicl
hi counten instantli assum an aspect of the deepest gloom and
he repli to seek on who fled from me
and did the man whom you pursu travel in the same fashion
ye
then i fanci we have seen him for the dai befor we pick you up we
saw some dog draw a sledg with a man in it across the ic
thi arous the stranger attent and he ask a multitud of
question concern the rout which the dmon as he call him had
pursu soon after when he wa alon with me he said i have
doubtless excit your curios as well as that of these good
peopl but you ar too consider to make inquiri
certainli it would inde be veri impertin and inhuman in me to
troubl you with ani inquisit of mine
and yet you rescu me from a strang and peril situat you have
benevol restor me to life
soon after thi he inquir if i thought that the break up of the
ic had destroi the other sledg i repli that i could not answer
with ani degre of certainti for the ic had not broken until near
midnight and the travel might have arriv at a place of safeti
befor that time but of thi i could not judg
from thi time a new spirit of life anim the decai frame of the
stranger he manifest the greatest eager to be upon deck to watch for
the sledg which had befor appear but i have persuad him to remain in
the cabin for he is far too weak to sustain the raw of the atmospher
i have promis that someon should watch for him and give him instant
notic if ani new object should appear in sight
such is my journal of what relat to thi strang occurr up to the
present dai the stranger ha gradual improv in health but is veri
silent and appear uneasi when anyon except myself enter hi cabin
yet hi manner ar so concili and gentl that the sailor ar all
interest in him although thei have had veri littl commun
with him for my own part i begin to love him as a brother and hi
constant and deep grief fill me with sympathi and compass he must
have been a nobl creatur in hi better dai be even now in wreck
so attract and amiabl
i said in on of my letter my dear margaret that i should find no friend
on the wide ocean yet i have found a man who befor hi spirit had been
broken by miseri i should have been happi to have possess as the brother
of my heart
i shall continu my journal concern the stranger at interv
should i have ani fresh incid to record
august 13th 17
my affect for my guest increas everi dai he excit at onc my
admir and my piti to an astonish degre how can i see so
nobl a creatur destroi by miseri without feel the most poignant
grief he is so gentl yet so wise hi mind is so cultiv and
when he speak although hi word ar cull with the choicest art
yet thei flow with rapid and unparallel eloqu
he is now much recov from hi ill and is continu on the deck
appar watch for the sledg that preced hi own yet although
unhappi he is not so utterli occupi by hi own miseri but that he
interest himself deepli in the project of other he ha frequent
convers with me on mine which i have commun to him without
disguis he enter attent into all my argument in favour of my
eventu success and into everi minut detail of the measur i had taken
to secur it i wa easili led by the sympathi which he evinc to us the
languag of my heart to give utter to the burn ardour of my soul
and to sai with all the fervour that warm me how gladli i would
sacrific my fortun my exist my everi hope to the further of my
enterpris on man life or death were but a small price to pai for
the acquir of the knowledg which i sought for the dominion i should
acquir and transmit over the element foe of our race as i spoke a
dark gloom spread over my listen counten at first i
perceiv that he tri to suppress hi emot he place hi hand befor
hi ey and my voic quiver and fail me as i beheld tear trickl
fast from between hi finger a groan burst from hi heav breast i
paus at length he spoke in broken accent unhappi man do you
share my mad have you drunk also of the intox draught hear me
let me reveal my tale and you will dash the cup from your lip
such word you mai imagin strongli excit my curios but the
paroxysm of grief that had seiz the stranger overcam hi weaken
power and mani hour of repos and tranquil convers were
necessari to restor hi composur
have conquer the violenc of hi feel he appear to despis
himself for be the slave of passion and quell the dark tyranni of
despair he led me again to convers concern myself person he ask
me the histori of my earlier year the tale wa quickli told but it
awaken variou train of reflect i spoke of my desir of find a
friend of my thirst for a more intim sympathi with a fellow mind than
had ever fallen to my lot and express my convict that a man could
boast of littl happi who did not enjoi thi bless
i agre with you repli the stranger we ar
unfashion creatur but half made up if on wiser better dearer than
ourselvessuch a friend ought to bedo not lend hi aid to
perfection our weak and faulti natur i onc had a friend the most
nobl of human creatur and am entitl therefor to judg respect
friendship you have hope and the world befor you and have no caus for
despair but ii have lost everyth and cannot begin life
anew
as he said thi hi counten becam express of a calm settl
grief that touch me to the heart but he wa silent and present
retir to hi cabin
even broken in spirit as he is no on can feel more deepli than he
doe the beauti of natur the starri sky the sea and everi sight
afford by these wonder region seem still to have the power of
elev hi soul from earth such a man ha a doubl exist he
mai suffer miseri and be overwhelm by disappoint yet when he
ha retir into himself he will be like a celesti spirit that ha a
halo around him within whose circl no grief or folli ventur
will you smile at the enthusiasm i express concern thi divin
wander you would not if you saw him you have been tutor and
refin by book and retir from the world and you ar therefor
somewhat fastidi but thi onli render you the more fit to
appreci the extraordinari merit of thi wonder man sometim i
have endeavour to discov what qualiti it is which he possess that
elev him so immeasur abov ani other person i ever knew i
believ it to be an intuit discern a quick but neverfail
power of judgment a penetr into the caus of thing unequal
for clear and precis add to thi a facil of express and a
voic whose vari inton ar soulsubdu music

yesterdai the stranger said to me you mai easili perceiv captain

glad akin to raptur as thei were unfold to me ar among the

on the birth of a second son my junior by seven year my parent gave
up entir their wander life and fix themselv in their nativ
countri we possess a hous in geneva and a campagn on belriv
the eastern shore of the lake at the distanc of rather more than a
leagu from the citi we resid princip in the latter and the
live of my parent were pass in consider seclus it wa my
temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervent to a few i wa
indiffer therefor to my schoolfellow in gener but i unit
myself in the bond of the closest friendship to on among them henri
clerval wa the son of a merchant of geneva he wa a boi of singular
talent and fanci he love enterpris hardship and even danger for
it own sake he wa deepli read in book of chivalri and romanc he
compos heroic song and began to write mani a tale of enchant and
knightli adventur he tri to make us act plai and to enter into
masquerad in which the charact were drawn from the hero of
roncesval of the round tabl of king arthur and the chivalr
train who shed their blood to redeem the holi sepulchr from the hand

no human be could have pass a happier childhood than myself my

we felt that thei were not the tyrant to rule our lot accord to
their capric but the agent and creator of all the mani delight
which we enjoi when i mingl with other famili i distinctli
discern how peculiarli fortun my lot wa and gratitud assist
the develop of filial love
my temper wa sometim violent and my passion vehement but by some
law in my temperatur thei were turn not toward childish pursuit
but to an eager desir to learn and not to learn all thing
indiscrimin i confess that neither the structur of languag
nor the code of govern nor the polit of variou state
possess attract for me it wa the secret of heaven and earth
that i desir to learn and whether it wa the outward substanc of
thing or the inner spirit of natur and the mysteri soul of man
that occupi me still my inquiri were direct to the metaphys

meanwhil clerval occupi himself so to speak with the moral

ambit
i feel exquisit pleasur in dwell on the recollect of childhood
befor misfortun had taint my mind and chang it bright vision of
extens us into gloomi and narrow reflect upon self besid
in draw the pictur of my earli dai i also record those event which
led by insens step to my after tale of miseri for when i would
account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterward rule my
destini i find it aris like a mountain river from ignobl and almost
forgotten sourc but swell as it proceed it becam the torrent
which in it cours ha swept awai all my hope and joi
natur philosophi is the geniu that ha regul my fate i desir
therefor in thi narrat to state those fact which led to my
predilect for that scienc when i wa thirteen year of ag we all went
on a parti of pleasur to the bath near thonon the inclem of the
weather oblig us to remain a dai confin to the inn in thi hous i
chanc to find a volum of the work of corneliu agrippa i open it
with apathi the theori which he attempt to demonstr and the wonder
fact which he relat soon chang thi feel into enthusiasm a new
light seem to dawn upon my mind and bound with joi i commun my
discoveri to my father my father look carelessli at the titl page of my
book and said ah corneliu agrippa my dear victor do not wast
your time upon thi it is sad trash
if instead of thi remark my father had taken the pain to explain to me
that the principl of agrippa had been entir explod and that a modern
system of scienc had been introduc which possess much greater power
than the ancient becaus the power of the latter were chimer while
those of the former were real and practic under such circumst i
should certainli have thrown agrippa asid and have content my
imagin warm as it wa by return with greater ardour to my
former studi it is even possibl that the train of my idea would never
have receiv the fatal impuls that led to my ruin but the cursori glanc
my father had taken of my volum by no mean assur me that he wa
acquaint with it content and i continu to read with the greatest
avid
when i return home my first care wa to procur the whole work of thi
author and afterward of paracelsu and albertu magnu i read and
studi the wild fanci of these writer with delight thei appear to me
treasur known to few besid myself i have describ myself as alwai
have been imbu with a fervent long to penetr the secret of
natur in spite of the intens labour and wonder discoveri of modern
philosoph i alwai came from my studi discont and unsatisfi
sir isaac newton is said to have avow that he felt like a child pick
up shell besid the great and unexplor ocean of truth those of hi
successor in each branch of natur philosophi with whom i wa acquaint
appear even to my boi apprehens as tyro engag in the same
pursuit
the untaught peasant beheld the element around him and wa acquaint
with their practic us the most learn philosoph knew littl
more he had partial unveil the face of natur but her immort
lineament were still a wonder and a mysteri he might dissect
anatomis and give name but not to speak of a final caus caus
in their secondari and tertiari grade were utterli unknown to him i
had gaze upon the fortif and impedi that seem to keep
human be from enter the citadel of natur and rashli and
ignorantli i had repin
but here were book and here were men who had penetr deeper and knew
more i took their word for all that thei aver and i becam their
discipl it mai appear strang that such should aris in the eighteenth
centuri but while i follow the routin of educ in the school of
geneva i wa to a great degre selftaught with regard to my favourit
studi my father wa not scientif and i wa left to struggl with a
child blind ad to a student thirst for knowledg
under the guidanc of my new preceptor i enter with the greatest
dilig into the search of the philosoph stone and the elixir
of life but the latter soon obtain my undivid attent wealth wa an
inferior object but what glori would attend the discoveri if i could
banish diseas from the human frame and render man invulner to ani but
a violent death
nor were these my onli vision the rais of ghost or devil wa a
promis liber accord by my favourit author the fulfil of which
i most eagerli sought and if my incant were alwai unsuccess i
attribut the failur rather to my own inexperi and mistak than to a
want of skill or fidel in my instructor and thu for a time i wa
occupi by explod system mingl like an unadept a thousand
contradictori theori and flounder desper in a veri slough of
multifari knowledg guid by an ardent imagin and childish
reason till an accid again chang the current of my idea
when i wa about fifteen year old we had retir to our hous near
belriv when we wit a most violent and terribl thunderstorm it
advanc from behind the mountain of jura and the thunder burst at onc
with fright loud from variou quarter of the heaven i remain
while the storm last watch it progress with curios and delight
as i stood at the door on a sudden i beheld a stream of fire issu from an
old and beauti oak which stood about twenti yard from our hous and so
soon as the dazzl light vanish the oak had disappear and noth
remain but a blast stump when we visit it the next morn we found
the tree shatter in a singular manner it wa not splinter by the
shock but entir reduc to thin ribbon of wood i never beheld
anyth so utterli destroi
befor thi i wa not unacquaint with the more obviou law of
electr on thi occas a man of great research in natur
philosophi wa with us and excit by thi catastroph he enter on
the explan of a theori which he had form on the subject of
electr and galvan which wa at onc new and astonish to me
all that he said threw greatli into the shade corneliu agrippa
albertu magnu and paracelsu the lord of my imagin but by
some fatal the overthrow of these men disinclin me to pursu my
accustom studi it seem to me as if noth would or could ever
be known all that had so long engag my attent suddenli grew
despic by on of those capric of the mind which we ar perhap
most subject to in earli youth i at onc gave up my former
occup set down natur histori and all it progeni as a deform
and abort creation and entertain the greatest disdain for a
wouldb scienc which could never even step within the threshold of
real knowledg in thi mood of mind i betook myself to the
mathemat and the branch of studi appertain to that scienc as
be built upon secur foundat and so worthi of my consider
thu strang ar our soul construct and by such slight ligament
ar we bound to prosper or ruin when i look back it seem to me
as if thi almost miracul chang of inclin and will wa the
immedi suggest of the guardian angel of my lifeth last effort
made by the spirit of preserv to avert the storm that wa even
then hang in the star and readi to envelop me her victori wa
announc by an unusu tranquil and glad of soul which
follow the relinquish of my ancient and latterli torment
studi it wa thu that i wa to be taught to associ evil with
their prosecut happi with their disregard
it wa a strong effort of the spirit of good but it wa ineffectu
destini wa too potent and her immut law had decre my utter and
terribl destruct
chapter 3
when i had attain the ag of seventeen my parent resolv that i
should becom a student at the univers of ingolstadt i had
hitherto attend the school of geneva but my father thought it
necessari for the complet of my educ that i should be made
acquaint with other custom than those of my nativ countri my
departur wa therefor fix at an earli date but befor the dai
resolv upon could arriv the first misfortun of my life
occurredan omen as it were of my futur miseri
elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever her ill wa sever and she wa
in the greatest danger dure her ill mani argument had been urg to
persuad my mother to refrain from attend upon her she had at first
yield to our entreati but when she heard that the life of her
favourit wa menac she could no longer control her anxieti she
attend her sickb her watch attent triumph over the malign
of the distemperelizabeth wa save but the consequ of thi
imprud were fatal to her preserv on the third dai my mother
sicken her fever wa accompani by the most alarm symptom and the
look of her medic attend prognost the worst event on her
deathb the fortitud and benign of thi best of women did not desert
her she join the hand of elizabeth and myself my
children she said my firmest hope of futur happi were
place on the prospect of your union thi expect will now be the
consol of your father elizabeth my love you must suppli my place to
my younger children ala i regret that i am taken from you and happi
and belov as i have been is it not hard to quit you all but these ar
not thought befit me i will endeavour to resign myself cheerfulli to
death and will indulg a hope of meet you in anoth world
she di calmli and her counten express affect even in death
i need not describ the feel of those whose dearest ti ar rent
by that most irrepar evil the void that present itself to the
soul and the despair that is exhibit on the counten it is so
long befor the mind can persuad itself that she whom we saw everi dai
and whose veri exist appear a part of our own can have depart
for everthat the bright of a belov ey can have been
extinguish and the sound of a voic so familiar and dear to the ear
can be hush never more to be heard these ar the reflect of
the first dai but when the laps of time prove the realiti of the
evil then the actual bitter of grief commenc yet from whom ha
not that rude hand rent awai some dear connect and why should i
describ a sorrow which all have felt and must feel the time at
length arriv when grief is rather an indulg than a necess and
the smile that plai upon the lip although it mai be deem a
sacrileg is not banish my mother wa dead but we had still
duti which we ought to perform we must continu our cours with the
rest and learn to think ourselv fortun whilst on remain whom the
spoiler ha not seiz
my departur for ingolstadt which had been defer by these event
wa now again determin upon i obtain from my father a respit of
some week it appear to me sacrileg so soon to leav the repos
akin to death of the hous of mourn and to rush into the thick of
life i wa new to sorrow but it did not the less alarm me i wa
unwil to quit the sight of those that remain to me and abov
all i desir to see my sweet elizabeth in some degre consol
she inde veil her grief and strove to act the comfort to us all
she look steadili on life and assum it duti with courag and
zeal she devot herself to those whom she had been taught to call
her uncl and cousin never wa she so enchant as at thi time
when she recal the sunshin of her smile and spent them upon us
she forgot even her own regret in her endeavour to make us forget
the dai of my departur at length arriv clerval spent the last
even with us he had endeavour to persuad hi father to permit
him to accompani me and to becom my fellow student but in vain hi
father wa a narrowmind trader and saw idl and ruin in the
aspir and ambit of hi son henri deepli felt the misfortun
of be debar from a liber educ he said littl but when
he spoke i read in hi kindl ey and in hi anim glanc a
restrain but firm resolv not to be chain to the miser detail
of commerc
we sat late we could not tear ourselv awai from each other nor
persuad ourselv to sai the word farewel it wa said and we
retir under the pretenc of seek repos each fanci that the
other wa deceiv but when at morn dawn i descend to the
carriag which wa to convei me awai thei were all theremi father
again to bless me clerval to press my hand onc more my elizabeth to
renew her entreati that i would write often and to bestow the last
feminin attent on her playmat and friend
i threw myself into the chais that wa to convei me awai and indulg in
the most melancholi reflect i who had ever been surround by
amiabl companion continu engag in endeavour to bestow mutual
pleasurei wa now alon in the univers whither i wa go i
must form my own friend and be my own protector my life had hitherto
been remark seclud and domest and thi had given me invinc
repugn to new counten i love my brother elizabeth and
clerval these were old familiar face but i believ myself
total unfit for the compani of stranger such were my reflect as
i commenc my journei but as i proceed my spirit and hope rose i
ardent desir the acquisit of knowledg i had often when at home
thought it hard to remain dure my youth coop up in on place and had
long to enter the world and take my station among other human be
now my desir were compli with and it would inde have been folli to
repent
i had suffici leisur for these and mani other reflect dure my
journei to ingolstadt which wa long and fatigu at length the
high white steepl of the town met my ey i alight and wa
conduct to my solitari apart to spend the even as i pleas
the next morn i deliv my letter of introduct and paid a visit to
some of the princip professor chanceor rather the evil
influenc the angel of destruct which assert omnipot swai over me
from the moment i turn my reluct step from my father
doorl me first to m kremp professor of natur philosophi he
wa an uncouth man but deepli imbu in the secret of hi scienc he
ask me sever question concern my progress in the differ branch
of scienc appertain to natur philosophi i repli carelessli and
partli in contempt mention the name of my alchemist as the princip
author i had studi the professor stare have you he
said realli spent your time in studi such nonsens
i repli in the affirm everi minut continu m kremp with
warmth everi instant that you have wast on those book is utterli
and entir lost you have burden your memori with explod system
and useless name good god in what desert land have you live
where no on wa kind enough to inform you that these fanci which you
have so greedili imbib ar a thousand year old and as musti as thei
ar ancient i littl expect in thi enlighten and scientif
ag to find a discipl of albertu magnu and paracelsu my dear
sir you must begin your studi entir anew
so sai he step asid and wrote down a list of sever book
treat of natur philosophi which he desir me to procur and
dismiss me after mention that in the begin of the follow
week he intend to commenc a cours of lectur upon natur
philosophi in it gener relat and that m waldman a fellow
professor would lectur upon chemistri the altern dai that he
omit
i return home not disappoint for i have said that i had long
consid those author useless whom the professor reprob but i
return not at all the more inclin to recur to these studi in ani
shape m kremp wa a littl squat man with a gruff voic and a
repuls counten the teacher therefor did not prepossess me in
favour of hi pursuit in rather a too philosoph and connect a
strain perhap i have given an account of the conclus i had come
to concern them in my earli year as a child i had not been
content with the result promis by the modern professor of natur
scienc with a confus of idea onli to be account for by my
extrem youth and my want of a guid on such matter i had retrod the
step of knowledg along the path of time and exchang the
discoveri of recent inquir for the dream of forgotten alchemist
besid i had a contempt for the us of modern natur philosophi
it wa veri differ when the master of the scienc sought
immort and power such view although futil were grand but now
the scene wa chang the ambit of the inquir seem to limit
itself to the annihil of those vision on which my interest in
scienc wa chiefli found i wa requir to exchang chimera of
boundless grandeur for realiti of littl worth
such were my reflect dure the first two or three dai of my
resid at ingolstadt which were chiefli spent in becom
acquaint with the local and the princip resid in my new
abod but as the ensu week commenc i thought of the inform
which m kremp had given me concern the lectur and although i
could not consent to go and hear that littl conceit fellow deliv
sentenc out of a pulpit i recollect what he had said of m
waldman whom i had never seen as he had hitherto been out of town
partli from curios and partli from idl i went into the lectur
room which m waldman enter shortli after thi professor wa veri
unlik hi colleagu he appear about fifti year of ag but with an
aspect express of the greatest benevol a few grei hair cover hi
templ but those at the back of hi head were nearli black hi person
wa short but remark erect and hi voic the sweetest i had ever heard
he began hi lectur by a recapitul of the histori of chemistri and
the variou improv made by differ men of learn pronounc
with fervour the name of the most distinguish discover he then took
a cursori view of the present state of the scienc and explain mani of
it elementari term after have made a few preparatori experi he
conclud with a panegyr upon modern chemistri the term of which i
shall never forget
the ancient teacher of thi scienc said he
promis imposs and perform noth the modern master
promis veri littl thei know that metal cannot be transmut and that
the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosoph whose hand seem
onli made to dabbl in dirt and their ey to pore over the microscop or
crucibl have inde perform miracl thei penetr into the recess
of natur and show how she work in her hidingplac thei ascend into the
heaven thei have discov how the blood circul and the natur of
the air we breath thei have acquir new and almost unlimit power
thei can command the thunder of heaven mimic the earthquak and even
mock the invis world with it own shadow
such were the professor wordsrath let me sai such the word of
the fateenounc to destroi me as he went on i felt as if my soul
were grappl with a palpabl enemi on by on the variou kei were
touch which form the mechan of my be chord after chord wa
sound and soon my mind wa fill with on thought on concept
on purpos so much ha been done exclaim the soul of
frankensteinmor far more will i achiev tread in the step
alreadi mark i will pioneer a new wai explor unknown power and
unfold to the world the deepest mysteri of creation
i close not my ey that night my intern be wa in a state of
insurrect and turmoil i felt that order would thenc aris but i
had no power to produc it by degre after the morn dawn
sleep came i awok and my yesternight thought were as a dream
there onli remain a resolut to return to my ancient studi and to
devot myself to a scienc for which i believ myself to possess a
natur talent on the same dai i paid m waldman a visit hi
manner in privat were even more mild and attract than in public
for there wa a certain digniti in hi mien dure hi lectur which in
hi own hous wa replac by the greatest affabl and kind i
gave him pretti nearli the same account of my former pursuit as i had
given to hi fellow professor he heard with attent the littl
narrat concern my studi and smile at the name of corneliu
agrippa and paracelsu but without the contempt that m kremp had
exhibit he said that these were men to whose indefatig zeal
modern philosoph were indebt for most of the foundat of their
knowledg thei had left to us as an easier task to give new name
and arrang in connect classif the fact which thei in a
great degre had been the instrument of bring to light the
labour of men of geniu howev erron direct scarc ever
fail in ultim turn to the solid advantag of mankind i
listen to hi statement which wa deliv without ani presumpt
or affect and then ad that hi lectur had remov my
prejudic against modern chemist i express myself in measur
term with the modesti and defer due from a youth to hi
instructor without let escap inexperi in life would have
made me asham ani of the enthusiasm which stimul my intend
labour i request hi advic concern the book i ought to
procur
i am happi said m waldman to have gain a
discipl and if your applic equal your abil i have no doubt of
your success chemistri is that branch of natur philosophi in which the
greatest improv have been and mai be made it is on that account that
i have made it my peculiar studi but at the same time i have not
neglect the other branch of scienc a man would make but a veri sorri
chemist if he attend to that depart of human knowledg alon if your
wish is to becom realli a man of scienc and not mere a petti
experimentalist i should advis you to appli to everi branch of natur
philosophi includ mathemat
he then took me into hi laboratori and explain to me the us of hi
variou machin instruct me as to what i ought to procur and
promis me the us of hi own when i should have advanc far enough in
the scienc not to derang their mechan he also gave me the list of
book which i had request and i took my leav
thu end a dai memor to me it decid my futur destini
chapter 4
from thi dai natur philosophi and particularli chemistri in the
most comprehens sens of the term becam nearli my sole occup
i read with ardour those work so full of geniu and discrimin
which modern inquir have written on these subject i attend the
lectur and cultiv the acquaint of the men of scienc of the
univers and i found even in m kremp a great deal of sound sens
and real inform combin it is true with a repuls
physiognomi and manner but not on that account the less valuabl in
m waldman i found a true friend hi gentl wa never ting by
dogmat and hi instruct were given with an air of frank and
good natur that banish everi idea of pedantri in a thousand wai
he smooth for me the path of knowledg and made the most abstrus
inquiri clear and facil to my apprehens my applic wa at
first fluctuat and uncertain it gain strength as i proceed and
soon becam so ardent and eager that the star often disappear in the
light of morn whilst i wa yet engag in my laboratori
as i appli so close it mai be easili conceiv that my progress
wa rapid my ardour wa inde the astonish of the student and
my profici that of the master professor kremp often ask me
with a sly smile how corneliu agrippa went on whilst m waldman
express the most heartfelt exult in my progress two year
pass in thi manner dure which i paid no visit to geneva but wa
engag heart and soul in the pursuit of some discoveri which i
hope to make none but those who have experienc them can conceiv
of the entic of scienc in other studi you go as far as
other have gone befor you and there is noth more to know but in
a scientif pursuit there is continu food for discoveri and wonder
a mind of moder capac which close pursu on studi must
infal arriv at great profici in that studi and i who
continu sought the attain of on object of pursuit and wa
sole wrap up in thi improv so rapidli that at the end of two
year i made some discoveri in the improv of some chemic
instrument which procur me great esteem and admir at the
univers when i had arriv at thi point and had becom as well
acquaint with the theori and practic of natur philosophi as
depend on the lesson of ani of the professor at ingolstadt my
resid there be no longer conduc to my improv i thought
of return to my friend and my nativ town when an incid
happen that protract my stai
on of the phenomena which had peculiarli attract my attent wa
the structur of the human frame and inde ani anim endu with
life whenc i often ask myself did the principl of life proce
it wa a bold question and on which ha ever been consid as a
mysteri yet with how mani thing ar we upon the brink of becom
acquaint if cowardic or careless did not restrain our
inquiri i revolv these circumst in my mind and determin
thenceforth to appli myself more particularli to those branch of
natur philosophi which relat to physiolog unless i had been
anim by an almost supernatur enthusiasm my applic to thi
studi would have been irksom and almost intoler to examin the
caus of life we must first have recours to death i becam
acquaint with the scienc of anatomi but thi wa not suffici i
must also observ the natur decai and corrupt of the human bodi
in my educ my father had taken the greatest precaut that my
mind should be impress with no supernatur horror i do not ever
rememb to have trembl at a tale of superstit or to have fear
the apparit of a spirit dark had no effect upon my fanci and
a churchyard wa to me mere the receptacl of bodi depriv of
life which from be the seat of beauti and strength had becom
food for the worm now i wa led to examin the caus and progress of
thi decai and forc to spend dai and night in vault and
charnelhous my attent wa fix upon everi object the most
insupport to the delicaci of the human feel i saw how the
fine form of man wa degrad and wast i beheld the corrupt of
death succe to the bloom cheek of life i saw how the worm
inherit the wonder of the ey and brain i paus examin and
analys all the minutia of causat as exemplifi in the chang
from life to death and death to life until from the midst of thi
dark a sudden light broke in upon mea light so brilliant and
wondrou yet so simpl that while i becam dizzi with the immens
of the prospect which it illustr i wa surpris that among so
mani men of geniu who had direct their inquiri toward the same
scienc that i alon should be reserv to discov so astonish a
secret
rememb i am not record the vision of a madman the sun doe not
more certainli shine in the heaven than that which i now affirm is
true some miracl might have produc it yet the stage of the
discoveri were distinct and probabl after dai and night of
incred labour and fatigu i succeed in discov the caus of
gener and life nai more i becam myself capabl of bestow
anim upon lifeless matter
the astonish which i had at first experienc on thi discoveri
soon gave place to delight and raptur after so much time spent in
pain labour to arriv at onc at the summit of my desir wa the
most gratifi consumm of my toil but thi discoveri wa so
great and overwhelm that all the step by which i had been
progress led to it were obliter and i beheld onli the result
what had been the studi and desir of the wisest men sinc the creation
of the world wa now within my grasp not that like a magic scene it
all open upon me at onc the inform i had obtain wa of a
natur rather to direct my endeavour so soon as i should point them
toward the object of my search than to exhibit that object alreadi
accomplish i wa like the arabian who had been buri with the dead
and found a passag to life aid onli by on glimmer and seemingli
ineffectu light
i see by your eager and the wonder and hope which your ey
express my friend that you expect to be inform of the secret with
which i am acquaint that cannot be listen patient until the end
of my stori and you will easili perceiv why i am reserv upon that
subject i will not lead you on unguard and ardent as i then wa
to your destruct and infal miseri learn from me if not by my
precept at least by my exampl how danger is the acquir of
knowledg and how much happier that man is who believ hi nativ town
to be the world than he who aspir to becom greater than hi natur
will allow
when i found so astonish a power place within my hand i hesit
a long time concern the manner in which i should emploi it
although i possess the capac of bestow anim yet to
prepar a frame for the recept of it with all it intricaci of
fibr muscl and vein still remain a work of inconceiv
difficulti and labour i doubt at first whether i should attempt the
creation of a be like myself or on of simpler organ but my
imagin wa too much exalt by my first success to permit me to
doubt of my abil to give life to an anim as complex and wonder
as man the materi at present within my command hardli appear
adequ to so arduou an undertak but i doubt not that i should
ultim succe i prepar myself for a multitud of revers my
oper might be incessantli baffl and at last my work be
imperfect yet when i consid the improv which everi dai take
place in scienc and mechan i wa encourag to hope my present
attempt would at least lai the foundat of futur success nor
could i consid the magnitud and complex of my plan as ani
argument of it impractic it wa with these feel that i
began the creation of a human be as the minut of the part
form a great hindranc to my speed i resolv contrari to my first
intent to make the be of a gigant statur that is to sai
about eight feet in height and proportion larg after have
form thi determin and have spent some month in successfulli
collect and arrang my materi i began
no on can conceiv the varieti of feel which bore me onward like
a hurrican in the first enthusiasm of success life and death
appear to me ideal bound which i should first break through and
pour a torrent of light into our dark world a new speci would bless
me as it creator and sourc mani happi and excel natur would
ow their be to me no father could claim the gratitud of hi
child so complet as i should deserv their pursu these
reflect i thought that if i could bestow anim upon lifeless
matter i might in process of time although i now found it imposs
renew life where death had appar devot the bodi to corrupt
these thought support my spirit while i pursu my undertak
with unremit ardour my cheek had grown pale with studi and my
person had becom emaci with confin sometim on the veri
brink of certainti i fail yet still i clung to the hope which the
next dai or the next hour might realis on secret which i alon
possess wa the hope to which i had dedic myself and the moon
gaze on my midnight labour while with unrelax and breathless
eager i pursu natur to her hidingplac who shall conceiv
the horror of my secret toil as i dabbl among the unhallow damp
of the grave or tortur the live anim to anim the lifeless
clai my limb now trembl and my ey swim with the remembr but
then a resistless and almost frantic impuls urg me forward i seem
to have lost all soul or sensat but for thi on pursuit it wa
inde but a pass tranc that onli made me feel with renew
acut so soon as the unnatur stimulu ceas to oper i had
return to my old habit i collect bone from charnelhous and
disturb with profan finger the tremend secret of the human
frame in a solitari chamber or rather cell at the top of the hous
and separ from all the other apart by a galleri and staircas
i kept my workshop of filthi creation my eyebal were start from
their socket in attend to the detail of my employ the
dissect room and the slaughterhous furnish mani of my materi
and often did my human natur turn with loath from my occup
whilst still urg on by an eager which perpetu increas i
brought my work near to a conclus
the summer month pass while i wa thu engag heart and soul in
on pursuit it wa a most beauti season never did the field
bestow a more plenti harvest or the vine yield a more luxuri
vintag but my ey were insens to the charm of natur and the
same feel which made me neglect the scene around me caus me also
to forget those friend who were so mani mile absent and whom i had
not seen for so long a time i knew my silenc disquiet them and i
well rememb the word of my father i know that while you ar
pleas with yourself you will think of us with affect and we shall
hear regularli from you you must pardon me if i regard ani
interrupt in your correspond as a proof that your other duti
ar equal neglect
i knew well therefor what would be my father feel but i could
not tear my thought from my employ loathsom in itself but which
had taken an irresist hold of my imagin i wish as it
were to procrastin all that relat to my feel of affect
until the great object which swallow up everi habit of my natur
should be complet
i then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascrib my neglect
to vice or faulti on my part but i am now convinc that he wa
justifi in conceiv that i should not be altogeth free from
blame a human be in perfect ought alwai to preserv a calm and
peac mind and never to allow passion or a transitori desir to
disturb hi tranquil i do not think that the pursuit of knowledg
is an except to thi rule if the studi to which you appli yourself
ha a tendenc to weaken your affect and to destroi your tast for
those simpl pleasur in which no alloi can possibl mix then that
studi is certainli unlaw that is to sai not befit the human
mind if thi rule were alwai observ if no man allow ani pursuit
whatsoev to interfer with the tranquil of hi domest
affect greec had not been enslav csar would have spare hi
countri america would have been discov more gradual and the
empir of mexico and peru had not been destroi
but i forget that i am moral in the most interest part of my
tale and your look remind me to proce
my father made no reproach in hi letter and onli took notic of my
silenc by inquir into my occup more particularli than befor
winter spring and summer pass awai dure my labour but i did not
watch the blossom or the expand leavessight which befor alwai
yield me suprem delightso deepli wa i engross in my
occup the leav of that year had wither befor my work drew near
to a close and now everi dai show me more plainli how well i had
succeed but my enthusiasm wa check by my anxieti and i appear
rather like on doom by slaveri to toil in the mine or ani other
unwholesom trade than an artist occupi by hi favourit employ
everi night i wa oppress by a slow fever and i becam nervou to a most
pain degre the fall of a leaf startl me and i shun my fellow
creatur as if i had been guilti of a crime sometim i grew alarm at
the wreck i perceiv that i had becom the energi of my purpos alon
sustain me my labour would soon end and i believ that exercis and
amus would then drive awai incipi diseas and i promis myself
both of these when my creation should be complet
chapter 5
it wa on a dreari night of novemb that i beheld the accomplish
of my toil with an anxieti that almost amount to agoni i
collect the instrument of life around me that i might infus a
spark of be into the lifeless thing that lai at my feet it wa
alreadi on in the morn the rain patter dismal against the
pane and my candl wa nearli burnt out when by the glimmer of the
halfextinguish light i saw the dull yellow ey of the creatur
open it breath hard and a convuls motion agit it limb
how can i describ my emot at thi catastroph or how delin
the wretch whom with such infinit pain and care i had endeavour to
form hi limb were in proport and i had select hi featur as
beauti beauti great god hi yellow skin scarc cover
the work of muscl and arteri beneath hi hair wa of a lustrou
black and flow hi teeth of a pearli white but these
luxuri onli form a more horrid contrast with hi wateri ey
that seem almost of the same colour as the dunwhit socket in which
thei were set hi shrivel complexion and straight black lip
the differ accid of life ar not so changeabl as the feel
of human natur i had work hard for nearli two year for the sole
purpos of infus life into an inanim bodi for thi i had
depriv myself of rest and health i had desir it with an ardour
that far exceed moder but now that i had finish the beauti
of the dream vanish and breathless horror and disgust fill my
heart unabl to endur the aspect of the be i had creat i
rush out of the room and continu a long time travers my
bedchamb unabl to compos my mind to sleep at length lassitud
succeed to the tumult i had befor endur and i threw myself on the
bed in my cloth endeavour to seek a few moment of forget
but it wa in vain i slept inde but i wa disturb by the wildest
dream i thought i saw elizabeth in the bloom of health walk in
the street of ingolstadt delight and surpris i embrac her
but as i imprint the first kiss on her lip thei becam livid with
the hue of death her featur appear to chang and i thought that i
held the corps of my dead mother in my arm a shroud envelop her
form and i saw the graveworm crawl in the fold of the flannel
i start from my sleep with horror a cold dew cover my forehead my
teeth chatter and everi limb becam convuls when by the dim and
yellow light of the moon as it forc it wai through the window
shutter i beheld the wretchth miser monster whom i had
creat he held up the curtain of the bed and hi ey if ey thei
mai be call were fix on me hi jaw open and he mutter some
inarticul sound while a grin wrinkl hi cheek he might have
spoken but i did not hear on hand wa stretch out seemingli to
detain me but i escap and rush downstair i took refug in the
courtyard belong to the hous which i inhabit where i remain
dure the rest of the night walk up and down in the greatest
agit listen attent catch and fear each sound as if
it were to announc the approach of the demoniac corps to which i
had so miser given life
oh no mortal could support the horror of that counten a mummi
again endu with anim could not be so hideou as that wretch i
had gaze on him while unfinish he wa ugli then but when those
muscl and joint were render capabl of motion it becam a thing
such as even dant could not have conceiv
i pass the night wretchedli sometim my puls beat so quickli and
hardli that i felt the palpit of everi arteri at other i nearli
sank to the ground through languor and extrem weak mingl with
thi horror i felt the bitter of disappoint dream that had
been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now becom a
hell to me and the chang wa so rapid the overthrow so complet
morn dismal and wet at length dawn and discov to my
sleepless and ach ey the church of ingolstadt it white steepl
and clock which indic the sixth hour the porter open the gate
of the court which had that night been my asylum and i issu into
the street pace them with quick step as if i sought to avoid the
wretch whom i fear everi turn of the street would present to my
view i did not dare return to the apart which i inhabit but
felt impel to hurri on although drench by the rain which pour
from a black and comfortless sky
i continu walk in thi manner for some time endeavour by
bodili exercis to eas the load that weigh upon my mind i
travers the street without ani clear concept of where i wa or
what i wa do my heart palpit in the sick of fear and i
hurri on with irregular step not dare to look about me
like on who on a lone road
doth walk in fear and dread
and have onc turn round walk on
and turn no more hi head
becaus he know a fright fiend
doth close behind him tread
coleridg ancient marin
continu thu i came at length opposit to the inn at which the variou
dilig and carriag usual stop here i paus i knew not why
but i remain some minut with my ey fix on a coach that wa come
toward me from the other end of the street as it drew nearer i observ
that it wa the swiss dilig it stop just where i wa stand and
on the door be open i perceiv henri clerval who on see me
instantli sprung out my dear frankenstein exclaim he
how glad i am to see you how fortun that you should be here at
the veri moment of my alight
noth could equal my delight on see clerval hi presenc brought back
to my thought my father elizabeth and all those scene of home so dear
to my recollect i grasp hi hand and in a moment forgot my horror
and misfortun i felt suddenli and for the first time dure mani month
calm and seren joi i welcom my friend therefor in the most cordial
manner and we walk toward my colleg clerval continu talk for
some time about our mutual friend and hi own good fortun in be
permit to come to ingolstadt you mai easili believ said
he how great wa the difficulti to persuad my father that all
necessari knowledg wa not compris in the nobl art of bookkeep
and inde i believ i left him incredul to the last for hi constant
answer to my unweari entreati wa the same as that of the dutch
schoolmast in the vicar of wakefield i have ten thousand florin
a year without greek i eat heartili without greek but hi
affect for me at length overcam hi dislik of learn and he ha
permit me to undertak a voyag of discoveri to the land of
knowledg
it give me the greatest delight to see you but tell me how you left
my father brother and elizabeth
veri well and veri happi onli a littl uneasi that thei hear from
you so seldom by the by i mean to lectur you a littl upon their
account myself but my dear frankenstein continu he stop
short and gaze full in my face i did not befor remark how veri ill
you appear so thin and pale you look as if you had been watch for
sever night
you have guess right i have late been so deepli engag in on
occup that i have not allow myself suffici rest as you see
but i hope i sincer hope that all these employ ar now at an
end and that i am at length free
i trembl excess i could not endur to think of and far less to
allud to the occurr of the preced night i walk with a
quick pace and we soon arriv at my colleg i then reflect and
the thought made me shiver that the creatur whom i had left in my
apart might still be there aliv and walk about i dread to
behold thi monster but i fear still more that henri should see him
entreat him therefor to remain a few minut at the bottom of the
stair i dart up toward my own room my hand wa alreadi on the
lock of the door befor i recollect myself i then paus and a
cold shiver came over me i threw the door forcibl open as
children ar accustom to do when thei expect a spectr to stand in
wait for them on the other side but noth appear i step
fearfulli in the apart wa empti and my bedroom wa also freed
from it hideou guest i could hardli believ that so great a good
fortun could have befallen me but when i becam assur that my enemi
had inde fled i clap my hand for joi and ran down to clerval
we ascend into my room and the servant present brought breakfast
but i wa unabl to contain myself it wa not joi onli that possess
me i felt my flesh tingl with excess of sensit and my puls
beat rapidli i wa unabl to remain for a singl instant in the same
place i jump over the chair clap my hand and laugh aloud
clerval at first attribut my unusu spirit to joi on hi arriv
but when he observ me more attent he saw a wild in my ey
for which he could not account and my loud unrestrain heartless
laughter frighten and astonish him
my dear victor cri he what for god sake
is the matter do not laugh in that manner how ill you ar what is the
caus of all thi
do not ask me cri i put my hand befor my ey for i
thought i saw the dread spectr glide into the room he can
tell oh save me save me i imagin that the monster seiz me
i struggl furious and fell down in a fit
poor clerval what must have been hi feel a meet which he
anticip with such joi so strang turn to bitter but i
wa not the wit of hi grief for i wa lifeless and did not
recov my sens for a long long time
thi wa the commenc of a nervou fever which confin me for
sever month dure all that time henri wa my onli nurs i
afterward learn that know my father advanc ag and unfit
for so long a journei and how wretch my sick would make
elizabeth he spare them thi grief by conceal the extent of my
disord he knew that i could not have a more kind and attent
nurs than himself and firm in the hope he felt of my recoveri he
did not doubt that instead of do harm he perform the kindest
action that he could toward them
but i wa in realiti veri ill and sure noth but the unbound and
unremit attent of my friend could have restor me to life
the form of the monster on whom i had bestow exist wa for ever
befor my ey and i rave incessantli concern him doubtless my
word surpris henri he at first believ them to be the wander
of my disturb imagin but the pertinac with which i
continu recur to the same subject persuad him that my disord
inde ow it origin to some uncommon and terribl event
by veri slow degre and with frequent relaps that alarm and
griev my friend i recov i rememb the first time i becam
capabl of observ outward object with ani kind of pleasur i
perceiv that the fallen leav had disappear and that the young
bud were shoot forth from the tree that shade my window it wa
a divin spring and the season contribut greatli to my
convalesc i felt also sentiment of joi and affect reviv in
my bosom my gloom disappear and in a short time i becam as
cheer as befor i wa attack by the fatal passion
dearest clerval exclaim i how kind how veri good

promis yourself ha been consum in my sick room how shall i ever
repai you i feel the greatest remors for the disappoint of which i
have been the occas but you will forgiv me
you will repai me entir if you do not discompos yourself but get
well as fast as you can and sinc you appear in such good spirit i
mai speak to you on on subject mai i not

chapter 6
clerval then put the follow letter into my hand it wa from my
own elizabeth
my dearest cousin
you have been ill veri ill and even the constant letter of dear
kind henri ar not suffici to reassur me on your account you ar
forbidden to writeto hold a pen yet on word from you dear victor

that each post would bring thi line and my persuas have
restrain my uncl from undertak a journei to ingolstadt i have
prevent hi encount the inconveni and perhap danger of so
long a journei yet how often have i regret not be abl to

distinct between the sever class of it inhabit and the
lower order be neither so poor nor so despis their manner ar
more refin and moral a servant in geneva doe not mean the same
thing as a servant in franc and england justin thu receiv in
our famili learn the duti of a servant a condit which in our

justin wa the most grate littl creatur in the world i do not
mean that she made ani profess i never heard on pass her lip but
you could see by her ey that she almost ador her protectress
although her disposit wa gai and in mani respect inconsider
yet she paid the greatest attent to everi gestur of my aunt she
thought her the model of all excel and endeavour to imit her
phraseolog and manner so that even now she often remind me of her

after your departur for ingolstadt justin wa call home by her
repent mother poor girl she wept when she quit our hous she

letter i will write instantli and reliev them from the anxieti
thei must feel i wrote and thi exert greatli fatigu me but
my convalesc had commenc and proceed regularli in anoth
fortnight i wa abl to leav my chamber
on of my first duti on my recoveri wa to introduc clerval to the
sever professor of the univers in do thi i underw a
kind of rough usag ill befit the wound that my mind had
sustain ever sinc the fatal night the end of my labour and the
begin of my misfortun i had conceiv a violent antipathi even
to the name of natur philosophi when i wa otherwis quit restor
to health the sight of a chemic instrument would renew all the agoni
of my nervou symptom henri saw thi and had remov all my
apparatu from my view he had also chang my apart for he
perceiv that i had acquir a dislik for the room which had
previous been my laboratori but these care of clerval were made of
no avail when i visit the professor m waldman inflict tortur
when he prais with kind and warmth the astonish progress i
had made in the scienc he soon perceiv that i dislik the
subject but not guess the real caus he attribut my feel to

more gloomili the pictur appear a vast and dim scene of evil and i
foresaw obscur that i wa destin to becom the most wretch of human

midnight among the precipic of an inaccess mountain i
rememb also the nervou fever with which i had been seiz just at
the time that i date my creation and which would give an air of
delirium to a tale otherwis so utterli improb i well knew that
if ani other had commun such a relat to me i should have
look upon it as the rave of insan besid the strang natur
of the anim would elud all pursuit even if i were so far credit

commenc my father and the rest of the famili be oblig to attend
as wit i accompani them to the court dure the whole of
thi wretch mockeri of justic i suffer live tortur it wa to
be decid whether the result of my curios and lawless devic would
caus the death of two of my fellow be on a smile babe full of
innoc and joi the other far more dreadfulli murder with everi
aggrav of infami that could make the murder memor in horror
justin also wa a girl of merit and possess qualiti which promis
to render her life happi now all wa to be obliter in an
ignomini grave and i the caus a thousand time rather would i
have confess myself guilti of the crime ascrib to justin but i
wa absent when it wa commit and such a declar would have
been consid as the rave of a madman and would not have
exculp her who suffer through me
the appear of justin wa calm she wa dress in mourn and
her counten alwai engag wa render by the solemn of her
feel exquisit beauti yet she appear confid in
innoc and did not trembl although gaze on and execr by
thousand for all the kind which her beauti might otherwis have
excit wa obliter in the mind of the spectat by the
imagin of the enorm she wa suppos to have commit she
wa tranquil yet her tranquil wa evid constrain and as
her confus had befor been adduc as a proof of her guilt she
work up her mind to an appear of courag when she enter the
court she threw her ey round it and quickli discov where we were
seat a tear seem to dim her ey when she saw us but she quickli
recov herself and a look of sorrow affect seem to attest
her utter guiltless
the trial began and after the advoc against her had state the
charg sever wit were call sever strang fact combin
against her which might have stagger anyon who had not such proof
of her innoc as i had she had been out the whole of the night on
which the murder had been commit and toward morn had been
perceiv by a marketwoman not far from the spot where the bodi of the
murder child had been afterward found the woman ask her what she
did there but she look veri strang and onli return a confus
and unintellig answer she return to the hous about eight
oclock and when on inquir where she had pass the night she
repli that she had been look for the child and demand earnestli
if anyth had been heard concern him when shown the bodi she
fell into violent hyster and kept her bed for sever dai the
pictur wa then produc which the servant had found in her pocket
and when elizabeth in a falter voic prove that it wa the same
which an hour befor the child had been miss she had place round
hi neck a murmur of horror and indign fill the court
justin wa call on for her defenc as the trial had proceed her
counten had alter surpris horror and miseri were strongli
express sometim she struggl with her tear but when she wa
desir to plead she collect her power and spoke in an audibl
although variabl voic
god know she said how entir i am innoc but i
do not pretend that my protest should acquit me i rest my innoc
on a plain and simpl explan of the fact which have been adduc
against me and i hope the charact i have alwai born will inclin my
judg to a favour interpret where ani circumst appear
doubt or suspici
she then relat that by the permiss of elizabeth she had pass
the even of the night on which the murder had been commit at the
hous of an aunt at chne a villag situat at about a leagu from
geneva on her return at about nine oclock she met a man who ask
her if she had seen anyth of the child who wa lost she wa
alarm by thi account and pass sever hour in look for him
when the gate of geneva were shut and she wa forc to remain
sever hour of the night in a barn belong to a cottag be
unwil to call up the inhabit to whom she wa well known most
of the night she spent here watch toward morn she believ that
she slept for a few minut some step disturb her and she awok
it wa dawn and she quit her asylum that she might again endeavour
to find my brother if she had gone near the spot where hi bodi lai
it wa without her knowledg that she had been bewild when
question by the marketwoman wa not surpris sinc she had pass
a sleepless night and the fate of poor william wa yet uncertain
concern the pictur she could give no account
i know continu the unhappi victim how heavili and
fatal thi on circumst weigh against me but i have no power of
explain it and when i have express my utter ignor i am onli left
to conjectur concern the probabl by which it might have been
place in my pocket but here also i am check i believ that i have no
enemi on earth and none sure would have been so wick as to destroi me
wantonli did the murder place it there i know of no opportun
afford him for so do or if i had why should he have stolen the
jewel to part with it again so soon
i commit my caus to the justic of my judg yet i see no room for
hope i beg permiss to have a few wit examin concern my
charact and if their testimoni shall not overweigh my suppos
guilt i must be condemn although i would pledg my salvat on my
innoc
sever wit were call who had known her for mani year and
thei spoke well of her but fear and hatr of the crime of which thei
suppos her guilti render them timor and unwil to come
forward elizabeth saw even thi last resourc her excel
disposit and irreproach conduct about to fail the accus
when although violent agit she desir permiss to address
the court
i am said she the cousin of the unhappi child who
wa murder or rather hi sister for i wa educ by and have live
with hi parent ever sinc and even long befor hi birth it mai
therefor be judg indec in me to come forward on thi occas but
when i see a fellow creatur about to perish through the cowardic of her
pretend friend i wish to be allow to speak that i mai sai what i
know of her charact i am well acquaint with the accus i have live
in the same hous with her at on time for five and at anoth for nearli
two year dure all that period she appear to me the most amiabl and
benevol of human creatur she nurs madam frankenstein my aunt in
her last ill with the greatest affect and care and afterward
attend her own mother dure a tediou ill in a manner that excit
the admir of all who knew her after which she again live in my
uncl hous where she wa belov by all the famili she wa
warmli attach to the child who is now dead and act toward him like a
most affection mother for my own part i do not hesit to sai that
notwithstand all the evid produc against her i believ and reli
on her perfect innoc she had no temptat for such an action as to
the baubl on which the chief proof rest if she had earnestli desir it
i should have willingli given it to her so much do i esteem and valu
her
a murmur of approb follow elizabeth simpl and power
appeal but it wa excit by her gener interfer and not in
favour of poor justin on whom the public indign wa turn with
renew violenc charg her with the blackest ingratitud she
herself wept as elizabeth spoke but she did not answer my own
agit and anguish wa extrem dure the whole trial i believ
in her innoc i knew it could the dmon who had i did not for a
minut doubt murder my brother also in hi hellish sport have
betrai the innoc to death and ignomini i could not sustain the
horror of my situat and when i perceiv that the popular voic and
the counten of the judg had alreadi condemn my unhappi victim
i rush out of the court in agoni the tortur of the accus did
not equal mine she wa sustain by innoc but the fang of
remors tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold
i pass a night of unmingl wretched in the morn i went to
the court my lip and throat were parch i dare not ask the fatal
question but i wa known and the offic guess the caus of my
visit the ballot had been thrown thei were all black and justin
wa condemn
i cannot pretend to describ what i then felt i had befor
experienc sensat of horror and i have endeavour to bestow upon
them adequ express but word cannot convei an idea of the
heartsicken despair that i then endur the person to whom i

chapter 9
noth is more pain to the human mind than after the feel have
been work up by a quick success of event the dead calm of
inact and certainti which follow and depriv the soul both of hope
and fear justin di she rest and i wa aliv the blood flow
freeli in my vein but a weight of despair and remors press on my
heart which noth could remov sleep fled from my ey i wander
like an evil spirit for i had commit deed of mischief beyond
descript horribl and more much more i persuad myself wa yet
behind yet my heart overflow with kind and the love of virtu
i had begun life with benevol intent and thirst for the moment
when i should put them in practic and make myself us to my fellow
be now all wa blast instead of that seren of conscienc
which allow me to look back upon the past with selfsatisfact and
from thenc to gather promis of new hope i wa seiz by remors and
the sens of guilt which hurri me awai to a hell of intens tortur
such as no languag can describ
thi state of mind prei upon my health which had perhap never
entir recov from the first shock it had sustain i shun
the face of man all sound of joi or complac wa tortur to me
solitud wa my onli consolationdeep dark deathlik solitud
my father observ with pain the alter percept in my disposit
and habit and endeavour by argument deduc from the feel of hi
seren conscienc and guiltless life to inspir me with fortitud and
awaken in me the courag to dispel the dark cloud which brood over me
do you think victor said he that i do not suffer
also no on could love a child more than i love your
brothertear came into hi ey as he spokebut
is it not a duti to the survivor that we should refrain from augment
their unhappi by an appear of immoder grief it is also a duti
ow to yourself for excess sorrow prevent improv or enjoy
or even the discharg of daili us without which no man is fit for
societi
thi advic although good wa total inapplic to my case i
should have been the first to hide my grief and consol my friend if
remors had not mingl it bitter and terror it alarm with my
other sensat now i could onli answer my father with a look of
despair and endeavour to hide myself from hi view
about thi time we retir to our hous at belriv thi chang wa
particularli agreeabl to me the shut of the gate regularli at
ten oclock and the imposs of remain on the lake after that
hour had render our resid within the wall of geneva veri irksom
to me i wa now free often after the rest of the famili had
retir for the night i took the boat and pass mani hour upon the
water sometim with my sail set i wa carri by the wind and
sometim after row into the middl of the lake i left the boat to
pursu it own cours and gave wai to my own miser reflect i
wa often tempt when all wa at peac around me and i the onli
unquiet thing that wander restless in a scene so beauti and
heavenlyif i except some bat or the frog whose harsh and
interrupt croak wa heard onli when i approach the shoreoften
i sai i wa tempt to plung into the silent lake that the water
might close over me and my calam for ever but i wa restrain
when i thought of the heroic and suffer elizabeth whom i tenderli
love and whose exist wa bound up in mine i thought also of my
father and surviv brother should i by my base desert leav them
expos and unprotect to the malic of the fiend whom i had let loos
among them
at these moment i wept bitterli and wish that peac would revisit my
mind onli that i might afford them consol and happi but that
could not be remors extinguish everi hope i had been the author of
unalter evil and i live in daili fear lest the monster whom i had
creat should perpetr some new wicked i had an obscur feel
that all wa not over and that he would still commit some signal crime
which by it enorm should almost effac the recollect of the past
there wa alwai scope for fear so long as anyth i love remain
behind my abhorr of thi fiend cannot be conceiv when i thought of
him i gnash my teeth my ey becam inflam and i ardent wish to
extinguish that life which i had so thoughtlessli bestow when i
reflect on hi crime and malic my hatr and reveng burst all bound
of moder i would have made a pilgrimag to the highest peak of the
and could i when there have precipit him to their base i wish
to see him again that i might wreak the utmost extent of abhorr on hi
head and aveng the death of william and justin
our hous wa the hous of mourn my father health wa deepli
shaken by the horror of the recent event elizabeth wa sad and
despond she no longer took delight in her ordinari occup all
pleasur seem to her sacrileg toward the dead etern woe and tear she
then thought wa the just tribut she should pai to innoc so blast
and destroi she wa no longer that happi creatur who in earlier youth
wander with me on the bank of the lake and talk with ecstasi of our
futur prospect the first of those sorrow which ar sent to wean us from
the earth had visit her and it dim influenc quench her dearest
smile
when i reflect my dear cousin said she on the miser death of
justin moritz i no longer see the world and it work as thei befor
appear to me befor i look upon the account of vice and
injustic that i read in book or heard from other as tale of ancient
dai or imaginari evil at least thei were remot and more familiar to
reason than to the imagin but now miseri ha come home and men
appear to me as monster thirst for each other blood yet i am
certainli unjust everybodi believ that poor girl to be guilti and
if she could have commit the crime for which she suffer assuredli
she would have been the most deprav of human creatur for the sake
of a few jewel to have murder the son of her benefactor and friend
a child whom she had nurs from it birth and appear to love as if
it had been her own i could not consent to the death of ani human
be but certainli i should have thought such a creatur unfit to
remain in the societi of men but she wa innoc i know i feel
she wa innoc you ar of the same opinion and that confirm me
ala victor when falsehood can look so like the truth who can
assur themselv of certain happi i feel as if i were walk on
the edg of a precipic toward which thousand ar crowd and
endeavour to plung me into the abyss william and justin were
assassin and the murder escap he walk about the world free
and perhap respect but even if i were condemn to suffer on the
scaffold for the same crime i would not chang place with such a
wretch
i listen to thi discours with the extremest agoni i not in deed
but in effect wa the true murder elizabeth read my anguish in my
counten and kindli take my hand said my dearest friend you
must calm yourself these event have affect me god know how
deepli but i am not so wretch as you ar there is an express of
despair and sometim of reveng in your counten that make me
trembl dear victor banish these dark passion rememb the
friend around you who centr all their hope in you have we lost
the power of render you happi ah while we love while we ar
true to each other here in thi land of peac and beauti your nativ
countri we mai reap everi tranquil blessingwhat can disturb our
peac
and could not such word from her whom i fondli prize befor everi
other gift of fortun suffic to chase awai the fiend that lurk in my
heart even as she spoke i drew near to her as if in terror lest at
that veri moment the destroy had been near to rob me of her
thu not the tender of friendship nor the beauti of earth nor of
heaven could redeem my soul from woe the veri accent of love were
ineffectu i wa encompass by a cloud which no benefici
influenc could penetr the wound deer drag it faint
limb to some untrodden brake there to gaze upon the arrow which had
pierc it and to die wa but a type of me
sometim i could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelm me but
sometim the whirlwind passion of my soul drove me to seek by bodili
exercis and by chang of place some relief from my intoler
sensat it wa dure an access of thi kind that i suddenli left
my home and bend my step toward the near alpin vallei sought
in the magnific the etern of such scene to forget myself and
my ephemer becaus human sorrow my wander were direct
toward the vallei of chamounix i had visit it frequent dure my
boyhood six year had pass sinc then i wa a wreck but nought
had chang in those savag and endur scene
i perform the first part of my journei on horseback i afterward
hire a mule as the more surefoot and least liabl to receiv
injuri on these rug road the weather wa fine it wa about the
middl of the month of august nearli two month after the death of
justin that miser epoch from which i date all my woe the
weight upon my spirit wa sensibl lighten as i plung yet deeper in
the ravin of arv the immens mountain and precipic that overhung
me on everi side the sound of the river rage among the rock and
the dash of the waterfal around spoke of a power mighti as
omnipotenceand i ceas to fear or to bend befor ani be less
almighti than that which had creat and rule the element here
displai in their most terrif guis still as i ascend higher
the vallei assum a more magnific and astonish charact
ruin castl hang on the precipic of pini mountain the
impetu arv and cottag everi here and there peep forth from
among the tree form a scene of singular beauti but it wa
augment and render sublim by the mighti alp whose white and
shine pyramid and dome tower abov all as belong to anoth
earth the habit of anoth race of be
i pass the bridg of plissier where the ravin which the river
form open befor me and i began to ascend the mountain that
overhang it soon after i enter the vallei of chamounix thi
vallei is more wonder and sublim but not so beauti and
picturesqu as that of servox through which i had just pass the
high and snowi mountain were it immedi boundari but i saw no
more ruin castl and fertil field immens glacier approach
the road i heard the rumbl thunder of the fall avalanch and
mark the smoke of it passag mont blanc the suprem and
magnific mont blanc rais itself from the surround aiguil
and it tremend dme overlook the vallei
a tingl longlost sens of pleasur often came across me dure thi
journei some turn in the road some new object suddenli perceiv and
recognis remind me of dai gone by and were associ with the
lightheart gaieti of boyhood the veri wind whisper in sooth
accent and matern natur bade me weep no more then again the
kindli influenc ceas to acti found myself fetter again to grief
and indulg in all the miseri of reflect then i spur on my
anim strive so to forget the world my fear and more than all
myselfor in a more desper fashion i alight and threw myself on
the grass weigh down by horror and despair
at length i arriv at the villag of chamounix exhaust succeed
to the extrem fatigu both of bodi and of mind which i had endur
for a short space of time i remain at the window watch the pallid
lightn that plai abov mont blanc and listen to the rush of

upon my pillow sleep crept over me i felt it as it came and bless
the giver of oblivion
chapter 10
i spent the follow dai roam through the vallei i stood besid
the sourc of the arveiron which take their rise in a glacier that
with slow pace is advanc down from the summit of the hill to
barricad the vallei the abrupt side of vast mountain were befor
me the ici wall of the glacier overhung me a few shatter pine were
scatter around and the solemn silenc of thi gloriou
presencechamb of imperi natur wa broken onli by the brawl
wave or the fall of some vast fragment the thunder sound of the
avalanch or the crack reverber along the mountain of the
accumul ic which through the silent work of immut law
wa ever and anon rent and torn as if it had been but a playth in
their hand these sublim and magnific scene afford me the
greatest consol that i wa capabl of receiv thei elev me
from all littl of feel and although thei did not remov my
grief thei subdu and tranquillis it in some degre also thei
divert my mind from the thought over which it had brood for the
last month i retir to rest at night my slumber as it were
wait on and minist to by the assembl of grand shape which i
had contempl dure the dai thei congreg round me the
unstain snowi mountaintop the glitter pinnacl the pine wood
and rag bare ravin the eagl soar amidst the cloudsthei all
gather round me and bade me be at peac
where had thei fled when the next morn i awok all of
soulinspirit fled with sleep and dark melancholi cloud everi
thought the rain wa pour in torrent and thick mist hid the
summit of the mountain so that i even saw not the face of those
mighti friend still i would penetr their misti veil and seek them
in their cloudi retreat what were rain and storm to me my mule wa
brought to the door and i resolv to ascend to the summit of
montanvert i rememb the effect that the view of the tremend
and evermov glacier had produc upon my mind when i first saw it
it had then fill me with a sublim ecstasi that gave wing to the
soul and allow it to soar from the obscur world to light and joi
the sight of the aw and majest in natur had inde alwai the
effect of solemnis my mind and caus me to forget the pass
care of life i determin to go without a guid for i wa well
acquaint with the path and the presenc of anoth would destroi the
solitari grandeur of the scene
the ascent is precipit but the path is cut into continu and short
wind which enabl you to surmount the perpendicular of the
mountain it is a scene terrif desol in a thousand spot
the trace of the winter avalanch mai be perceiv where tree lie
broken and strew on the ground some entir destroi other bent
lean upon the jut rock of the mountain or transvers upon
other tree the path as you ascend higher is intersect by ravin
of snow down which stone continu roll from abov on of them is
particularli danger as the slightest sound such as even speak
in a loud voic produc a concuss of air suffici to draw
destruct upon the head of the speaker the pine ar not tall or
luxuri but thei ar sombr and add an air of sever to the scene
i look on the vallei beneath vast mist were rise from the river
which ran through it and curl in thick wreath around the opposit
mountain whose summit were hid in the uniform cloud while rain
pour from the dark sky and ad to the melancholi impress i
receiv from the object around me ala why doe man boast of
sensibl superior to those appar in the brute it onli render
them more necessari be if our impuls were confin to hunger
thirst and desir we might be nearli free but now we ar move by
everi wind that blow and a chanc word or scene that that word mai
convei to us
we rest a dream ha power to poison sleep
we rise on wandr thought pollut the dai
we feel conceiv or reason laugh or weep
embrac fond woe or cast our care awai
it is the same for be it joi or sorrow
the path of it departur still is free
man yesterdai mai neer be like hi morrow
nought mai endur but mutabl
it wa nearli noon when i arriv at the top of the ascent for some
time i sat upon the rock that overlook the sea of ic a mist cover
both that and the surround mountain present a breez dissip
the cloud and i descend upon the glacier the surfac is veri
uneven rise like the wave of a troubl sea descend low and
interspers by rift that sink deep the field of ic is almost a
leagu in width but i spent nearli two hour in cross it the
opposit mountain is a bare perpendicular rock from the side where i
now stood montanvert wa exactli opposit at the distanc of a leagu
and abov it rose mont blanc in aw majesti i remain in a recess
of the rock gaze on thi wonder and stupend scene the sea
or rather the vast river of ic wound among it depend mountain
whose aerial summit hung over it recess their ici and glitter
peak shone in the sunlight over the cloud my heart which wa
befor sorrow now swell with someth like joi i exclaim
wander spirit if inde ye wander and do not rest in your narrow
bed allow me thi faint happi or take me as your companion
awai from the joi of life
as i said thi i suddenli beheld the figur of a man at some distanc
advanc toward me with superhuman speed he bound over the
crevic in the ic among which i had walk with caution hi
statur also as he approach seem to exce that of man i wa
troubl a mist came over my ey and i felt a faint seiz me
but i wa quickli restor by the cold gale of the mountain i
perceiv as the shape came nearer sight tremend and abhor
that it wa the wretch whom i had creat i trembl with rage and
horror resolv to wait hi approach and then close with him in
mortal combat he approach hi counten bespok bitter anguish
combin with disdain and malign while it unearthli ugli

wa oblig to shut my ey dark then came over me and troubl
me but hardli had i felt thi when by open my ey as i now
suppos the light pour in upon me again i walk and i believ
descend but i present found a great alter in my sensat
befor dark and opaqu bodi had surround me impervi to my
touch or sight but i now found that i could wander on at liberti with
no obstacl which i could not either surmount or avoid the light
becam more and more oppress to me and the heat weari me as i
walk i sought a place where i could receiv shade thi wa the
forest near ingolstadt and here i lai by the side of a brook rest
from my fatigu until i felt torment by hunger and thirst thi
rous me from my nearli dormant state and i at some berri which i
found hang on the tree or ly on the ground i slake my thirst
at the brook and then ly down wa overcom by sleep

were instinct find myself so desol befor i had quit
your apart on a sensat of cold i had cover myself with some
cloth but these were insuffici to secur me from the dew of
night i wa a poor helpless miser wretch i knew and could
distinguish noth but feel pain invad me on all side i sat
down and wept
soon a gentl light stole over the heaven and gave me a sensat of
pleasur i start up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the
tree the moon i gaze with a kind of wonder it move slowli
but it enlighten my path and i again went out in search of berri
i wa still cold when under on of the tree i found a huge cloak with
which i cover myself and sat down upon the ground no distinct
idea occupi my mind all wa confus i felt light and hunger
and thirst and dark innumer sound rang in my ear and on
all side variou scent salut me the onli object that i could
distinguish wa the bright moon and i fix my ey on that with
pleasur
sever chang of dai and night pass and the orb of night had
greatli lessen when i began to distinguish my sensat from each
other i gradual saw plainli the clear stream that suppli me with
drink and the tree that shade me with their foliag i wa delight
when i first discov that a pleasant sound which often salut my
ear proceed from the throat of the littl wing anim who had
often intercept the light from my ey i began also to observ
with greater accuraci the form that surround me and to perceiv the
boundari of the radiant roof of light which canopi me sometim i
tri to imit the pleasant song of the bird but wa unabl
sometim i wish to express my sensat in my own mode but the
uncouth and inarticul sound which broke from me frighten me into
silenc again
the moon had disappear from the night and again with a lessen
form show itself while i still remain in the forest my
sensat had by thi time becom distinct and my mind receiv everi
dai addit idea my ey becam accustom to the light and to
perceiv object in their right form i distinguish the insect from
the herb and by degre on herb from anoth i found that the
sparrow utter none but harsh note whilst those of the blackbird and
thrush were sweet and entic
on dai when i wa oppress by cold i found a fire which had been
left by some wander beggar and wa overcom with delight at the
warmth i experienc from it in my joi i thrust my hand into the live
ember but quickli drew it out again with a cry of pain how strang
i thought that the same caus should produc such opposit effect i
examin the materi of the fire and to my joi found it to be
compos of wood i quickli collect some branch but thei were wet
and would not burn i wa pain at thi and sat still watch the
oper of the fire the wet wood which i had place near the heat
dri and itself becam inflam i reflect on thi and by touch
the variou branch i discov the caus and busi myself in
collect a great quantiti of wood that i might dry it and have a
plenti suppli of fire when night came on and brought sleep with
it i wa in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguish i
cover it carefulli with dry wood and leav and place wet branch
upon it and then spread my cloak i lai on the ground and sank
into sleep
it wa morn when i awok and my first care wa to visit the fire
i uncov it and a gentl breez quickli fan it into a flame i
observ thi also and contriv a fan of branch which rous the
ember when thei were nearli extinguish when night came again i
found with pleasur that the fire gave light as well as heat and that
the discoveri of thi element wa us to me in my food for i found
some of the offal that the travel had left had been roast and
tast much more savouri than the berri i gather from the tree i
tri therefor to dress my food in the same manner place it on
the live ember i found that the berri were spoil by thi
oper and the nut and root much improv
food howev becam scarc and i often spent the whole dai
search in vain for a few acorn to assuag the pang of hunger when
i found thi i resolv to quit the place that i had hitherto
inhabit to seek for on where the few want i experienc would be
more easili satisfi in thi emigr i exceedingli lament the
loss of the fire which i had obtain through accid and knew not how
to reproduc it i gave sever hour to the seriou consider of
thi difficulti but i wa oblig to relinquish all attempt to suppli
it and wrap myself up in my cloak i struck across the wood
toward the set sun i pass three dai in these rambl and at
length discov the open countri a great fall of snow had taken
place the night befor and the field were of on uniform white the
appear wa disconsol and i found my feet chill by the cold
damp substanc that cover the ground
it wa about seven in the morn and i long to obtain food and
shelter at length i perceiv a small hut on a rise ground which
had doubtless been built for the conveni of some shepherd thi
wa a new sight to me and i examin the structur with great
curios find the door open i enter an old man sat in it
near a fire over which he wa prepar hi breakfast he turn on
hear a nois and perceiv me shriek loudli and quit the
hut ran across the field with a speed of which hi debilit form
hardli appear capabl hi appear differ from ani i had ever
befor seen and hi flight somewhat surpris me but i wa enchant
by the appear of the hut here the snow and rain could not
penetr the ground wa dry and it present to me then as exquisit
and divin a retreat as pandmonium appear to the dmon of hell
after their suffer in the lake of fire i greedili devour the
remnant of the shepherd breakfast which consist of bread chees
milk and wine the latter howev i did not like then overcom by
fatigu i lai down among some straw and fell asleep
it wa noon when i awok and allur by the warmth of the sun which
shone brightli on the white ground i determin to recomm my
travel and deposit the remain of the peasant breakfast in a
wallet i found i proceed across the field for sever hour until
at sunset i arriv at a villag how miracul did thi appear the
hut the neater cottag and state hous engag my admir by
turn the veget in the garden the milk and chees that i saw
place at the window of some of the cottag allur my appetit on
of the best of these i enter but i had hardli place my foot within
the door befor the children shriek and on of the women faint
the whole villag wa rous some fled some attack me until
grievous bruis by stone and mani other kind of missil weapon i
escap to the open countri and fearfulli took refug in a low hovel
quit bare and make a wretch appear after the palac i had
beheld in the villag thi hovel howev join a cottag of a neat
and pleasant appear but after my late dearli bought experi i
dare not enter it my place of refug wa construct of wood but so
low that i could with difficulti sit upright in it no wood howev
wa place on the earth which form the floor but it wa dry and
although the wind enter it by innumer chink i found it an
agreeabl asylum from the snow and rain
here then i retreat and lai down happi to have found a shelter
howev miser from the inclem of the season and still more
from the barbar of man as soon as morn dawn i crept from my
kennel that i might view the adjac cottag and discov if i could
remain in the habit i had found it wa situat against the back
of the cottag and surround on the side which were expos by a pig
sty and a clear pool of water on part wa open and by that i had
crept in but now i cover everi crevic by which i might be perceiv
with stone and wood yet in such a manner that i might move them on
occas to pass out all the light i enjoi came through the sty and
that wa suffici for me
have thu arrang my dwell and carpet it with clean straw i
retir for i saw the figur of a man at a distanc and i rememb
too well my treatment the night befor to trust myself in hi power i
had first howev provid for my susten for that dai by a loaf
of coars bread which i purloin and a cup with which i could drink
more conveni than from my hand of the pure water which flow by
my retreat the floor wa a littl rais so that it wa kept
perfectli dry and by it vicin to the chimnei of the cottag it wa
toler warm
be thu provid i resolv to resid in thi hovel until
someth should occur which might alter my determin it wa
inde a paradis compar to the bleak forest my former resid
the raindrop branch and dank earth i at my breakfast with
pleasur and wa about to remov a plank to procur myself a littl
water when i heard a step and look through a small chink i beheld
a young creatur with a pail on her head pass befor my hovel the
girl wa young and of gentl demeanour unlik what i have sinc found
cottag and farmhous servant to be yet she wa meanli dress a
coars blue petticoat and a linen jacket be her onli garb her fair
hair wa plait but not adorn she look patient yet sad i lost
sight of her and in about a quarter of an hour she return bear
the pail which wa now partli fill with milk as she walk along
seemingli incommod by the burden a young man met her whose
counten express a deeper despond utter a few sound with
an air of melancholi he took the pail from her head and bore it to the
cottag himself she follow and thei disappear present i saw
the young man again with some tool in hi hand cross the field
behind the cottag and the girl wa also busi sometim in the
hous and sometim in the yard
on examin my dwell i found that on of the window of the
cottag had formerli occupi a part of it but the pane had been
fill up with wood in on of these wa a small and almost
impercept chink through which the ey could just penetr
through thi crevic a small room wa visibl whitewash and clean
but veri bare of furnitur in on corner near a small fire sat an
old man lean hi head on hi hand in a disconsol attitud the
young girl wa occupi in arrang the cottag but present she
took someth out of a drawer which emploi her hand and she sat
down besid the old man who take up an instrument began to plai
and to produc sound sweeter than the voic of the thrush or the
nightingal it wa a love sight even to me poor wretch who had
never beheld aught beauti befor the silver hair and benevol
counten of the ag cottag won my rever while the gentl
manner of the girl entic my love he plai a sweet mourn air
which i perceiv drew tear from the ey of hi amiabl companion of
which the old man took no notic until she sob audibl he then
pronounc a few sound and the fair creatur leav her work knelt
at hi feet he rais her and smile with such kind and affect
that i felt sensat of a peculiar and overpow natur thei were
a mixtur of pain and pleasur such as i had never befor experienc
either from hunger or cold warmth or food and i withdrew from the
window unabl to bear these emot
soon after thi the young man return bear on hi shoulder a
load of wood the girl met him at the door help to reliev him of
hi burden and take some of the fuel into the cottag place it on
the fire then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottag
and he show her a larg loaf and a piec of chees she seem
pleas and went into the garden for some root and plant which she
place in water and then upon the fire she afterward continu her
work whilst the young man went into the garden and appear busili
emploi in dig and pull up root after he had been emploi
thu about an hour the young woman join him and thei enter the
cottag togeth
the old man had in the meantim been pensiv but on the appear
of hi companion he assum a more cheer air and thei sat down to
eat the meal wa quickli dispatch the young woman wa again
occupi in arrang the cottag the old man walk befor the
cottag in the sun for a few minut lean on the arm of the youth
noth could exce in beauti the contrast between these two excel
creatur on wa old with silver hair and a counten beam
with benevol and love the younger wa slight and grace in hi
figur and hi featur were mould with the finest symmetri yet hi
ey and attitud express the utmost sad and despond the
old man return to the cottag and the youth with tool differ
from those he had us in the morn direct hi step across the
field
night quickli shut in but to my extrem wonder i found that the
cottag had a mean of prolong light by the us of taper and wa
delight to find that the set of the sun did not put an end to the
pleasur i experienc in watch my human neighbour in the even
the young girl and her companion were emploi in variou occup
which i did not understand and the old man again took up the
instrument which produc the divin sound that had enchant me in
the morn so soon as he had finish the youth began not to plai
but to utter sound that were monoton and neither resembl the
harmoni of the old man instrument nor the song of the bird i sinc
found that he read aloud but at that time i knew noth of the
scienc of word or letter
the famili after have been thu occupi for a short time
extinguish their light and retir as i conjectur to rest
chapter 12
i lai on my straw but i could not sleep i thought of the
occurr of the dai what chiefli struck me wa the gentl manner
of these peopl and i long to join them but dare not i
rememb too well the treatment i had suffer the night befor from
the barbar villag and resolv whatev cours of conduct i
might hereaft think it right to pursu that for the present i would
remain quietli in my hovel watch and endeavour to discov the
motiv which influenc their action
the cottag aros the next morn befor the sun the young woman
arrang the cottag and prepar the food and the youth depart
after the first meal
thi dai wa pass in the same routin as that which preced it
the young man wa constantli emploi out of door and the girl in
variou labori occup within the old man whom i soon
perceiv to be blind emploi hi leisur hour on hi instrument or
in contempl noth could exce the love and respect which the
younger cottag exhibit toward their vener companion thei
perform toward him everi littl offic of affect and duti with
gentl and he reward them by hi benevol smile
thei were not entir happi the young man and hi companion often
went apart and appear to weep i saw no caus for their unhappi
but i wa deepli affect by it if such love creatur were
miser it wa less strang that i an imperfect and solitari be
should be wretch yet why were these gentl be unhappi thei
possess a delight hous for such it wa in my ey and everi
luxuri thei had a fire to warm them when chill and delici viand
when hungri thei were dress in excel cloth and still more
thei enjoi on anoth compani and speech interchang each dai
look of affect and kind what did their tear impli did thei
realli express pain i wa at first unabl to solv these question
but perpetu attent and time explain to me mani appear which
were at first enigmat
a consider period elaps befor i discov on of the caus of
the uneasi of thi amiabl famili it wa poverti and thei
suffer that evil in a veri distress degre their nourish
consist entir of the veget of their garden and the milk of
on cow which gave veri littl dure the winter when it master
could scarc procur food to support it thei often i believ
suffer the pang of hunger veri poignantli especi the two
younger cottag for sever time thei place food befor the old
man when thei reserv none for themselv
thi trait of kind move me sensibl i had been accustom
dure the night to steal a part of their store for my own
consumpt but when i found that in do thi i inflict pain on
the cottag i abstain and satisfi myself with berri nut and
root which i gather from a neighbour wood
i discov also anoth mean through which i wa enabl to assist
their labour i found that the youth spent a great part of each dai
in collect wood for the famili fire and dure the night i often
took hi tool the us of which i quickli discov and brought home
fire suffici for the consumpt of sever dai
i rememb the first time that i did thi the young woman when she
open the door in the morn appear greatli astonish on see a great
pile of wood on the outsid she utter some word in a loud voic and the
youth join her who also express surpris i observ with pleasur
that he did not go to the forest that dai but spent it in repair the
cottag and cultiv the garden
by degre i made a discoveri of still greater moment i found that
these peopl possess a method of commun their experi and
feel to on anoth by articul sound i perceiv that the word
thei spoke sometim produc pleasur or pain smile or sad in the
mind and counten of the hearer thi wa inde a godlik scienc
and i ardent desir to becom acquaint with it but i wa baffl in
everi attempt i made for thi purpos their pronunci wa quick and
the word thei utter not have ani appar connect with visibl
object i wa unabl to discov ani clue by which i could unravel the
mysteri of their refer by great applic howev and after have
remain dure the space of sever revolut of the moon in my hovel i
discov the name that were given to some of the most familiar object of
discours i learn and appli the word fire milk bread and
wood i learn also the name of the cottag themselv the youth
and hi companion had each of them sever name but the old man had onli
on which wa father the girl wa call sister or
agatha and the youth felix brother or son i cannot
describ the delight i felt when i learn the idea appropri to each of
these sound and wa abl to pronounc them i distinguish sever other
word without be abl as yet to understand or appli them such as good
dearest unhappi
i spent the winter in thi manner the gentl manner and beauti of
the cottag greatli endear them to me when thei were unhappi i
felt depress when thei rejoic i sympathis in their joi i saw
few human be besid them and if ani other happen to enter the
cottag their harsh manner and rude gait onli enhanc to me the
superior accomplish of my friend the old man i could perceiv
often endeavour to encourag hi children as sometim i found that
he call them to cast off their melancholi he would talk in a
cheer accent with an express of good that bestow pleasur
even upon me agatha listen with respect her ey sometim fill
with tear which she endeavour to wipe awai unperceiv but i
gener found that her counten and tone were more cheer after
have listen to the exhort of her father it wa not thu
with felix he wa alwai the saddest of the group and even to my
unpractis sens he appear to have suffer more deepli than hi
friend but if hi counten wa more sorrow hi voic wa more
cheer than that of hi sister especi when he address the old
man
i could mention innumer instanc which although slight mark
the disposit of these amiabl cottag in the midst of poverti
and want felix carri with pleasur to hi sister the first littl
white flower that peep out from beneath the snowi ground earli in
the morn befor she had risen he clear awai the snow that
obstruct her path to the milkhous drew water from the well and
brought the wood from the outhous where to hi perpetu
astonish he found hi store alwai replenish by an invis
hand in the dai i believ he work sometim for a neighbour
farmer becaus he often went forth and did not return until dinner
yet brought no wood with him at other time he work in the garden
but as there wa littl to do in the frosti season he read to the old
man and agatha
thi read had puzzl me extrem at first but by degre i
discov that he utter mani of the same sound when he read as when
he talk i conjectur therefor that he found on the paper sign
for speech which he understood and i ardent long to comprehend
these also but how wa that possibl when i did not even understand
the sound for which thei stood as sign i improv howev
sensibl in thi scienc but not suffici to follow up ani kind of
convers although i appli my whole mind to the endeavour for i
easili perceiv that although i eagerli long to discov myself to
the cottag i ought not to make the attempt until i had first becom
master of their languag which knowledg might enabl me to make them
overlook the deform of my figur for with thi also the contrast
perpetu present to my ey had made me acquaint
i had admir the perfect form of my cottagerstheir grace beauti
and delic complexion but how wa i terrifi when i view myself
in a transpar pool at first i start back unabl to believ that
it wa inde i who wa reflect in the mirror and when i becam
fulli convinc that i wa in realiti the monster that i am i wa
fill with the bitterest sensat of despond and mortif
ala i did not yet entir know the fatal effect of thi miser
deform
as the sun becam warmer and the light of dai longer the snow
vanish and i beheld the bare tree and the black earth from thi
time felix wa more emploi and the heartmov indic of
impend famin disappear their food as i afterward found wa
coars but it wa wholesom and thei procur a suffici of it
sever new kind of plant sprang up in the garden which thei
dress and these sign of comfort increas daili as the season
advanc
the old man lean on hi son walk each dai at noon when it did
not rain as i found it wa call when the heaven pour forth it
water thi frequent took place but a high wind quickli dri the
earth and the season becam far more pleasant than it had been
my mode of life in my hovel wa uniform dure the morn i
attend the motion of the cottag and when thei were dispers in
variou occup i slept the remaind of the dai wa spent in
observ my friend when thei had retir to rest if there wa ani
moon or the night wa starlight i went into the wood and collect
my own food and fuel for the cottag when i return as often as it
wa necessari i clear their path from the snow and perform those
offic that i had seen done by felix i afterward found that these
labour perform by an invis hand greatli astonish them and
onc or twice i heard them on these occas utter the word good
spirit wonder but i did not then understand the signif
of these term
my thought now becam more activ and i long to discov the
motiv and feel of these love creatur i wa inquisit to
know why felix appear so miser and agatha so sad i thought
foolish wretch that it might be in my power to restor happi to
these deserv peopl when i slept or wa absent the form of the
vener blind father the gentl agatha and the excel felix
flit befor me i look upon them as superior be who would be
the arbit of my futur destini i form in my imagin a
thousand pictur of present myself to them and their recept of
me i imagin that thei would be disgust until by my gentl
demeanour and concili word i should first win their favour and
afterward their love
these thought exhilar me and led me to appli with fresh ardour to
the acquir the art of languag my organ were inde harsh but
suppl and although my voic wa veri unlik the soft music of their
tone yet i pronounc such word as i understood with toler eas
it wa as the ass and the lapdog yet sure the gentl ass whose
intent were affection although hi manner were rude deserv
better treatment than blow and execr
the pleasant shower and genial warmth of spring greatli alter the
aspect of the earth men who befor thi chang seem to have been
hid in cave dispers themselv and were emploi in variou art of
cultiv the bird sang in more cheer note and the leav
began to bud forth on the tree happi happi earth fit habit
for god which so short a time befor wa bleak damp and
unwholesom my spirit were elev by the enchant appear of
natur the past wa blot from my memori the present wa tranquil
and the futur gild by bright rai of hope and anticip of joi
chapter 13
i now hasten to the more move part of my stori i shall relat
event that impress me with feel which from what i had been
have made me what i am
spring advanc rapidli the weather becam fine and the ski
cloudless it surpris me that what befor wa desert and gloomi
should now bloom with the most beauti flower and verdur my
sens were gratifi and refresh by a thousand scent of delight and
a thousand sight of beauti
it wa on on of these dai when my cottag period rest
from labourth old man plai on hi guitar and the children
listen to himthat i observ the counten of felix wa
melancholi beyond express he sigh frequent and onc hi father
paus in hi music and i conjectur by hi manner that he inquir
the caus of hi son sorrow felix repli in a cheer accent and
the old man wa recommenc hi music when someon tap at the door
it wa a ladi on horseback accompani by a countryman as a guid
the ladi wa dress in a dark suit and cover with a thick black
veil agatha ask a question to which the stranger onli repli by
pronounc in a sweet accent the name of felix her voic wa
music but unlik that of either of my friend on hear thi word
felix came up hastili to the ladi who when she saw him threw up her
veil and i beheld a counten of angel beauti and express her
hair of a shine raven black and curious braid her ey were
dark but gentl although anim her featur of a regular
proport and her complexion wondrous fair each cheek ting with
a love pink
felix seem ravish with delight when he saw her everi trait of
sorrow vanish from hi face and it instantli express a degre of
ecstat joi of which i could hardli have believ it capabl hi
ey sparkl as hi cheek flush with pleasur and at that moment i
thought him as beauti as the stranger she appear affect by
differ feel wipe a few tear from her love ey she held
out her hand to felix who kiss it raptur and call her as
well as i could distinguish hi sweet arabian she did not appear to
understand him but smile he assist her to dismount and
dismiss her guid conduct her into the cottag some
convers took place between him and hi father and the young
stranger knelt at the old man feet and would have kiss hi hand
but he rais her and embrac her affection
i soon perceiv that although the stranger utter articul sound
and appear to have a languag of her own she wa neither understood
by nor herself understood the cottag thei made mani sign which i
did not comprehend but i saw that her presenc diffus glad
through the cottag dispel their sorrow as the sun dissip the
morn mist felix seem peculiarli happi and with smile of
delight welcom hi arabian agatha the evergentl agatha kiss
the hand of the love stranger and point to her brother made
sign which appear to me to mean that he had been sorrow until she
came some hour pass thu while thei by their counten
express joi the caus of which i did not comprehend present i
found by the frequent recurr of some sound which the stranger
repeat after them that she wa endeavour to learn their languag
and the idea instantli occur to me that i should make us of the
same instruct to the same end the stranger learn about twenti
word at the first lesson most of them inde were those which i had
befor understood but i profit by the other
as night came on agatha and the arabian retir earli when thei
separ felix kiss the hand of the stranger and said good night
sweet safi he sat up much longer convers with hi father and
by the frequent repetit of her name i conjectur that their love
guest wa the subject of their convers i ardent desir to
understand them and bent everi faculti toward that purpos but found
it utterli imposs
the next morn felix went out to hi work and after the usual
occup of agatha were finish the arabian sat at the feet of the
old man and take hi guitar plai some air so entrancingli
beauti that thei at onc drew tear of sorrow and delight from my
ey she sang and her voic flow in a rich cadenc swell or
dy awai like a nightingal of the wood
when she had finish she gave the guitar to agatha who at first
declin it she plai a simpl air and her voic accompani it in
sweet accent but unlik the wondrou strain of the stranger the old
man appear enraptur and said some word which agatha endeavour to
explain to safi and by which he appear to wish to express that she
bestow on him the greatest delight by her music
the dai now pass as peaceabl as befor with the sole alter
that joi had taken place of sad in the counten of my friend
safi wa alwai gai and happi she and i improv rapidli in the
knowledg of languag so that in two month i began to comprehend most
of the word utter by my protector
in the meanwhil also the black ground wa cover with herbag and
the green bank interspers with innumer flower sweet to the
scent and the ey star of pale radianc among the moonlight wood
the sun becam warmer the night clear and balmi and my nocturn
rambl were an extrem pleasur to me although thei were consider
shorten by the late set and earli rise of the sun for i never
ventur abroad dure daylight fear of meet with the same
treatment i had formerli endur in the first villag which i enter
my dai were spent in close attent that i might more speedili
master the languag and i mai boast that i improv more rapidli than
the arabian who understood veri littl and convers in broken
accent whilst i comprehend and could imit almost everi word that
wa spoken
while i improv in speech i also learn the scienc of letter as
it wa taught to the stranger and thi open befor me a wide field
for wonder and delight
the book from which felix instruct safi wa volnei ruin
of empir i should not have understood the purport of thi book had not
felix in read it given veri minut explan he had chosen thi
work he said becaus the declamatori style wa frame in imit of the
eastern author through thi work i obtain a cursori knowledg of histori
and a view of the sever empir at present exist in the world it gave
me an insight into the manner govern and religion of the differ
nation of the earth i heard of the sloth asiat of the stupend
geniu and mental activ of the grecian of the war and wonder virtu
of the earli romansof their subsequ degeneratingof the
declin of that mighti empir of chivalri christian and king i heard
of the discoveri of the american hemispher and wept with safi over the
hapless fate of it origin inhabit
these wonder narrat inspir me with strang feel wa
man inde at onc so power so virtuou and magnific yet so
viciou and base he appear at on time a mere scion of the evil
principl and at anoth as all that can be conceiv of nobl and
godlik to be a great and virtuou man appear the highest honour
that can befal a sensit be to be base and viciou as mani on
record have been appear the lowest degrad a condit more
abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm for a long time i
could not conceiv how on man could go forth to murder hi fellow or
even why there were law and govern but when i heard detail of
vice and bloodsh my wonder ceas and i turn awai with disgust and
loath
everi convers of the cottag now open new wonder to me
while i listen to the instruct which felix bestow upon the
arabian the strang system of human societi wa explain to me i
heard of the divis of properti of immens wealth and squalid
poverti of rank descent and nobl blood
the word induc me to turn toward myself i learn that the
possess most esteem by your fellow creatur were high and
unsulli descent unit with rich a man might be respect with
onli on of these advantag but without either he wa consid
except in veri rare instanc as a vagabond and a slave doom to
wast hi power for the profit of the chosen few and what wa i of
my creation and creator i wa absolut ignor but i knew that i
possess no monei no friend no kind of properti i wa besid
endu with a figur hideous deform and loathsom i wa not even
of the same natur as man i wa more agil than thei and could
subsist upon coarser diet i bore the extrem of heat and cold with
less injuri to my frame my statur far exceed their when i look
around i saw and heard of none like me wa i then a monster a blot
upon the earth from which all men fled and whom all men disown
i cannot describ to you the agoni that these reflect inflict
upon me i tri to dispel them but sorrow onli increas with
knowledg oh that i had for ever remain in my nativ wood nor
known nor felt beyond the sensat of hunger thirst and heat
of what a strang natur is knowledg it cling to the mind when it
ha onc seiz on it like a lichen on the rock i wish sometim to
shake off all thought and feel but i learn that there wa but on
mean to overcom the sensat of pain and that wa deatha state
which i fear yet did not understand i admir virtu and good
feel and love the gentl manner and amiabl qualiti of my
cottag but i wa shut out from intercours with them except
through mean which i obtain by stealth when i wa unseen and
unknown and which rather increas than satisfi the desir i had of
becom on among my fellow the gentl word of agatha and the
anim smile of the charm arabian were not for me the mild
exhort of the old man and the live convers of the love
felix were not for me miser unhappi wretch
other lesson were impress upon me even more deepli i heard of the
differ of sex and the birth and growth of children how the
father dote on the smile of the infant and the live salli of the
older child how all the life and care of the mother were wrap up
in the preciou charg how the mind of youth expand and gain
knowledg of brother sister and all the variou relationship which
bind on human be to anoth in mutual bond
but where were my friend and relat no father had watch my
infant dai no mother had bless me with smile and caress or if
thei had all my past life wa now a blot a blind vacanc in which i
distinguish noth from my earliest remembr i had been as i
then wa in height and proport i had never yet seen a be
resembl me or who claim ani intercours with me what wa i the
question again recur to be answer onli with groan
i will soon explain to what these feel tend but allow me now to
return to the cottag whose stori excit in me such variou
feel of indign delight and wonder but which all termin
in addit love and rever for my protector for so i love in
an innoc halfpain selfdeceit to call them

constantinopl to join him he wa tri and condemn to death the
injustic of hi sentenc wa veri flagrant all pari wa indign
and it wa judg that hi religion and wealth rather than the crime
alleg against him had been the caus of hi condemn
felix had accident been present at the trial hi horror and
indign were uncontrol when he heard the decis of the

look around for the mean after mani fruitless attempt to gain
admitt to the prison he found a strongli grate window in an
unguard part of the build which light the dungeon of the

by promis of reward and wealth felix reject hi offer with
contempt yet when he saw the love safi who wa allow to visit
her father and who by her gestur express her live gratitud the
youth could not help own to hi own mind that the captiv possess
a treasur which would fulli reward hi toil and hazard
the turk quickli perceiv the impress that hi daughter had made
on the heart of felix and endeavour to secur him more entir in
hi interest by the promis of her hand in marriag so soon as he
should be convei to a place of safeti felix wa too delic to

the substanc of them to you
safi relat that her mother wa a christian arab seiz and made a
slave by the turk recommend by her beauti she had won the heart of
the father of safi who marri her the young girl spoke in high and
enthusiast term of her mother who born in freedom spurn the
bondag to which she wa now reduc she instruct her daughter in
the tenet of her religion and taught her to aspir to higher power of
intellect and an independ of spirit forbidden to the femal
follow of muhammad thi ladi di but her lesson were indel
impress on the mind of safi who sicken at the prospect of again
return to asia and be immur within the wall of a harem
allow onli to occupi herself with infantil amus illsuit to
the temper of her soul now accustom to grand idea and a nobl
emul for virtu the prospect of marri a christian and
remain in a countri where women were allow to take a rank in
societi wa enchant to her
the dai for the execut of the turk wa fix but on the night
previou to it he quit hi prison and befor morn wa distant
mani leagu from pari felix had procur passport in the name of
hi father sister and himself he had previous commun hi
plan to the former who aid the deceit by quit hi hous under
the pretenc of a journei and conceal himself with hi daughter in
an obscur part of pari
felix conduct the fugit through franc to lyon and across mont
ceni to leghorn where the merchant had decid to wait a favour
opportun of pass into some part of the turkish dominion
safi resolv to remain with her father until the moment of hi
departur befor which time the turk renew hi promis that she
should be unit to hi deliver and felix remain with them in
expect of that event and in the meantim he enjoi the societi
of the arabian who exhibit toward him the simplest and tenderest
affect thei convers with on anoth through the mean of an
interpret and sometim with the interpret of look and safi
sang to him the divin air of her nativ countri
the turk allow thi intimaci to take place and encourag the hope
of the youth lover while in hi heart he had form far other
plan he loath the idea that hi daughter should be unit to a
christian but he fear the resent of felix if he should appear
lukewarm for he knew that he wa still in the power of hi deliver
if he should choos to betrai him to the italian state which thei
inhabit he revolv a thousand plan by which he should be enabl
to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessari and
secretli to take hi daughter with him when he depart hi plan
were facilit by the new which arriv from pari
the govern of franc were greatli enrag at the escap of their
victim and spare no pain to detect and punish hi deliver the
plot of felix wa quickli discov and de lacei and agatha were

with the turk that if the latter should find a favour opportun
for escap befor felix could return to itali safi should remain as a
boarder at a convent at leghorn and then quit the love arabian
he hasten to pari and deliv himself up to the vengeanc of the
law hope to free de lacei and agatha by thi proceed
he did not succe thei remain confin for five month befor the
trial took place the result of which depriv them of their fortun
and condemn them to a perpetu exil from their nativ countri
thei found a miser asylum in the cottag in germani where i
discov them felix soon learn that the treacher turk for

discov that hi deliver wa thu reduc to poverti and ruin
becam a traitor to good feel and honour and had quit itali with
hi daughter insultingli send felix a pittanc of monei to aid him

such were the event that prei on the heart of felix and render
him when i first saw him the most miser of hi famili he could
have endur poverti and while thi distress had been the meed of hi
virtu he glori in it but the ingratitud of the turk and the loss
of hi belov safi were misfortun more bitter and irrepar the

intend to leav hi daughter under the care of a confidenti
servant to follow at her leisur with the greater part of hi

when alon safi resolv in her own mind the plan of conduct that it
would becom her to pursu in thi emerg a resid in turkei

chapter 15
such wa the histori of my belov cottag it impress me deepli
i learn from the view of social life which it develop to admir
their virtu and to deprec the vice of mankind
as yet i look upon crime as a distant evil benevol and
generos were ever present befor me incit within me a desir to
becom an actor in the busi scene where so mani admir qualiti
were call forth and displai but in give an account of the
progress of my intellect i must not omit a circumst which occur
in the begin of the month of august of the same year
on night dure my accustom visit to the neighbour wood where i
collect my own food and brought home fire for my protector i found on
the ground a leathern portmanteau contain sever articl of dress and
some book i eagerli seiz the prize and return with it to my hovel
fortun the book were written in the languag the element of which i
had acquir at the cottag thei consist of paradis lost a volum
of plutarch live and the sorrow of werter the
possess of these treasur gave me extrem delight i now continu
studi and exercis my mind upon these histori whilst my friend were
emploi in their ordinari occup
i can hardli describ to you the effect of these book thei produc
in me an infin of new imag and feel that sometim rais me
to ecstasi but more frequent sunk me into the lowest deject in
the sorrow of werter besid the interest of it simpl and affect
stori so mani opinion ar canvass and so mani light thrown upon
what had hitherto been to me obscur subject that i found in it a
neverend sourc of specul and astonish the gentl and
domest manner it describ combin with lofti sentiment and
feel which had for their object someth out of self accord
well with my experi among my protector and with the want which
were for ever aliv in my own bosom but i thought werter himself a
more divin be than i had ever beheld or imagin hi charact
contain no pretens but it sank deep the disquisit upon
death and suicid were calcul to fill me with wonder i did not
pretend to enter into the merit of the case yet i inclin toward
the opinion of the hero whose extinct i wept without precis
understand it
as i read howev i appli much person to my own feel and
condit i found myself similar yet at the same time strang
unlik to the be concern whom i read and to whose convers i
wa a listen i sympathis with and partli understood them but i
wa unform in mind i wa depend on none and relat to none
the path of my departur wa free and there wa none to lament my
annihil my person wa hideou and my statur gigant what did
thi mean who wa i what wa i whenc did i come what wa my
destin these question continu recur but i wa unabl to
solv them
the volum of plutarch live which i possess contain the
histori of the first founder of the ancient republ thi book
had a far differ effect upon me from the sorrow of werter i
learn from werter imagin despond and gloom but plutarch
taught me high thought he elev me abov the wretch sphere of my
own reflect to admir and love the hero of past ag mani
thing i read surpass my understand and experi i had a veri
confus knowledg of kingdom wide extent of countri mighti river
and boundless sea but i wa perfectli unacquaint with town and
larg assemblag of men the cottag of my protector had been the
onli school in which i had studi human natur but thi book
develop new and mightier scene of action i read of men concern
in public affair govern or massacr their speci i felt the
greatest ardour for virtu rise within me and abhorr for vice as
far as i understood the signif of those term rel as thei
were as i appli them to pleasur and pain alon induc by these
feel i wa of cours led to admir peaceabl lawgiv numa
solon and lycurgu in prefer to romulu and theseu the
patriarch live of my protector caus these impress to take a
firm hold on my mind perhap if my first introduct to human had
been made by a young soldier burn for glori and slaughter i should
have been imbu with differ sensat
but paradis lost excit differ and far deeper emot i read
it as i had read the other volum which had fallen into my hand as
a true histori it move everi feel of wonder and aw that the
pictur of an omnipot god war with hi creatur wa capabl of
excit i often refer the sever situat as their similar
struck me to my own like adam i wa appar unit by no link to
ani other be in exist but hi state wa far differ from mine
in everi other respect he had come forth from the hand of god a
perfect creatur happi and prosper guard by the especi care of
hi creator he wa allow to convers with and acquir knowledg from
be of a superior natur but i wa wretch helpless and alon
mani time i consid satan as the fitter emblem of my condit for
often like him when i view the bliss of my protector the bitter
gall of envi rose within me
anoth circumst strengthen and confirm these feel soon
after my arriv in the hovel i discov some paper in the pocket of
the dress which i had taken from your laboratori at first i had
neglect them but now that i wa abl to deciph the charact in
which thei were written i began to studi them with dilig it wa
your journal of the four month that preced my creation you
minut describ in these paper everi step you took in the progress
of your work thi histori wa mingl with account of domest
occurr you doubtless recollect these paper here thei ar
everyth is relat in them which bear refer to my accurs
origin the whole detail of that seri of disgust circumst
which produc it is set in view the minutest descript of my odiou
and loathsom person is given in languag which paint your own
horror and render mine indel i sicken as i read hate
dai when i receiv life i exclaim in agoni accurs creator
why did you form a monster so hideou that even you turn from me in
disgust god in piti made man beauti and allur after hi own
imag but my form is a filthi type of your more horrid even from the
veri resembl satan had hi companion fellow devil to admir
and encourag him but i am solitari and abhor
these were the reflect of my hour of despond and solitud
but when i contempl the virtu of the cottag their amiabl and
benevol disposit i persuad myself that when thei should
becom acquaint with my admir of their virtu thei would
compassion me and overlook my person deform could thei turn
from their door on howev monstrou who solicit their compass
and friendship i resolv at least not to despair but in everi wai
to fit myself for an interview with them which would decid my fate i
postpon thi attempt for some month longer for the import
attach to it success inspir me with a dread lest i should fail
besid i found that my understand improv so much with everi
dai experi that i wa unwil to commenc thi undertak
until a few more month should have ad to my sagac
sever chang in the meantim took place in the cottag the
presenc of safi diffus happi among it inhabit and i also
found that a greater degre of plenti reign there felix and agatha
spent more time in amus and convers and were assist in
their labour by servant thei did not appear rich but thei were
content and happi their feel were seren and peac while
mine becam everi dai more tumultu increas of knowledg onli
discov to me more clearli what a wretch outcast i wa i
cherish hope it is true but it vanish when i beheld my person
reflect in water or my shadow in the moonshin even as that frail
imag and that inconst shade
i endeavour to crush these fear and to fortifi myself for the trial
which in a few month i resolv to undergo and sometim i allow my
thought uncheck by reason to rambl in the field of paradis and
dare to fanci amiabl and love creatur sympathis with my
feel and cheer my gloom their angel counten breath
smile of consol but it wa all a dream no ev sooth my
sorrow nor share my thought i wa alon i rememb adam
supplic to hi creator but where wa mine he had abandon me
and in the bitter of my heart i curs him
autumn pass thu i saw with surpris and grief the leav decai
and fall and natur again assum the barren and bleak appear it
had worn when i first beheld the wood and the love moon yet i did
not heed the bleak of the weather i wa better fit by my
conform for the endur of cold than heat but my chief
delight were the sight of the flower the bird and all the gai
apparel of summer when those desert me i turn with more attent
toward the cottag their happi wa not decreas by the
absenc of summer thei love and sympathis with on anoth and
their joi depend on each other were not interrupt by the
casualti that took place around them the more i saw of them the
greater becam my desir to claim their protect and kind my
heart yearn to be known and love by these amiabl creatur to see
their sweet look direct toward me with affect wa the utmost
limit of my ambit i dare not think that thei would turn them from
me with disdain and horror the poor that stop at their door were
never driven awai i ask it is true for greater treasur than a
littl food or rest i requir kind and sympathi but i did not
believ myself utterli unworthi of it
the winter advanc and an entir revolut of the season had taken
place sinc i awok into life my attent at thi time wa sole
direct toward my plan of introduc myself into the cottag of my
protector i revolv mani project but that on which i final
fix wa to enter the dwell when the blind old man should be alon
i had sagac enough to discov that the unnatur hideous of my
person wa the chief object of horror with those who had formerli
beheld me my voic although harsh had noth terribl in it i
thought therefor that if in the absenc of hi children i could gain
the good will and mediat of the old de lacei i might by hi mean
be toler by my younger protector

chapter 16
curs curs creator why did i live why in that instant did i
not extinguish the spark of exist which you had so wantonli
bestow i know not despair had not yet taken possess of me my
feel were those of rage and reveng i could with pleasur have
destroi the cottag and it inhabit and have glut myself with
their shriek and miseri
when night came i quit my retreat and wander in the wood and
now no longer restrain by the fear of discoveri i gave vent to my
anguish in fear howl i wa like a wild beast that had broken
the toil destroi the object that obstruct me and rang
through the wood with a staglik swift oh what a miser
night i pass the cold star shone in mockeri and the bare tree
wave their branch abov me now and then the sweet voic of a bird
burst forth amidst the univers still all save i were at rest
or in enjoy i like the archfiend bore a hell within me and
find myself unsympathis with wish to tear up the tree spread
havoc and destruct around me and then to have sat down and enjoi
the ruin
but thi wa a luxuri of sensat that could not endur i becam
fatigu with excess of bodili exert and sank on the damp grass in
the sick impot of despair there wa none among the myriad of men
that exist who would piti or assist me and should i feel kind
toward my enemi no from that moment i declar everlast war
against the speci and more than all against him who had form me
and sent me forth to thi insupport miseri
the sun rose i heard the voic of men and knew that it wa
imposs to return to my retreat dure that dai accordingli i hid
myself in some thick underwood determin to devot the ensu hour
to reflect on my situat
the pleasant sunshin and the pure air of dai restor me to some
degre of tranquil and when i consid what had pass at the
cottag i could not help believ that i had been too hasti in my
conclus i had certainli act imprud it wa appar that
my convers had interest the father in my behalf and i wa a
fool in have expos my person to the horror of hi children i
ought to have familiaris the old de lacei to me and by degre to
have discov myself to the rest of hi famili when thei should have
been prepar for my approach but i did not believ my error to be
irretriev and after much consider i resolv to return to the
cottag seek the old man and by my represent win him to my
parti
these thought calm me and in the afternoon i sank into a profound
sleep but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visit by
peac dream the horribl scene of the preced dai wa for ever
act befor my ey the femal were fly and the enrag felix
tear me from hi father feet i awok exhaust and find that
it wa alreadi night i crept forth from my hidingplac and went in
search of food
when my hunger wa appeas i direct my step toward the
wellknown path that conduct to the cottag all there wa at peac
i crept into my hovel and remain in silent expect of the
accustom hour when the famili aros that hour pass the sun
mount high in the heaven but the cottag did not appear i
trembl violent apprehend some dread misfortun the insid
of the cottag wa dark and i heard no motion i cannot describ the
agoni of thi suspens
present two countrymen pass by but paus near the cottag thei
enter into convers us violent gesticul but i did not
understand what thei said as thei spoke the languag of the countri
which differ from that of my protector soon after howev felix
approach with anoth man i wa surpris as i knew that he had not
quit the cottag that morn and wait anxious to discov from
hi discours the mean of these unusu appear
do you consid said hi companion to him
that you will be oblig to pai three month rent and to lose
the produc of your garden i do not wish to take ani unfair advantag and
i beg therefor that you will take some dai to consid of your
determin
it is utterli useless repli felix we can
never again inhabit your cottag the life of my father is in the greatest
danger ow to the dread circumst that i have relat my wife and
my sister will never recov from their horror i entreat you not to reason
with me ani more take possess of your tenement and let me fly from thi
place
felix trembl violent as he said thi he and hi companion
enter the cottag in which thei remain for a few minut and then
depart i never saw ani of the famili of de lacei more
i continu for the remaind of the dai in my hovel in a state of
utter and stupid despair my protector had depart and had broken
the onli link that held me to the world for the first time the
feel of reveng and hatr fill my bosom and i did not strive to
control them but allow myself to be born awai by the stream i
bent my mind toward injuri and death when i thought of my friend
of the mild voic of de lacei the gentl ey of agatha and the
exquisit beauti of the arabian these thought vanish and a gush of
tear somewhat sooth me but again when i reflect that thei had
spurn and desert me anger return a rage of anger and unabl to
injur anyth human i turn my furi toward inanim object as
night advanc i place a varieti of combust around the cottag
and after have destroi everi vestig of cultiv in the garden
i wait with forc impati until the moon had sunk to commenc my
oper
as the night advanc a fierc wind aros from the wood and quickli
dispers the cloud that had loiter in the heaven the blast tore
along like a mighti avalanch and produc a kind of insan in my
spirit that burst all bound of reason and reflect i light the
dry branch of a tree and danc with furi around the devot cottag
my ey still fix on the western horizon the edg of which the moon
nearli touch a part of it orb wa at length hid and i wave my
brand it sank and with a loud scream i fire the straw and heath
and bush which i had collect the wind fan the fire and the
cottag wa quickli envelop by the flame which clung to it and
lick it with their fork and destroi tongu
as soon as i wa convinc that no assist could save ani part of
the habit i quit the scene and sought for refug in the wood
and now with the world befor me whither should i bend my step i
resolv to fly far from the scene of my misfortun but to me hate
and despis everi countri must be equal horribl at length the
thought of you cross my mind i learn from your paper that you
were my father my creator and to whom could i appli with more fit
than to him who had given me life among the lesson that felix had
bestow upon safi geographi had not been omit i had learn from
these the rel situat of the differ countri of the earth
you had mention geneva as the name of your nativ town and toward
thi place i resolv to proce
but how wa i to direct myself i knew that i must travel in a
southwesterli direct to reach my destin but the sun wa my
onli guid i did not know the name of the town that i wa to pass
through nor could i ask inform from a singl human be but i
did not despair from you onli could i hope for succour although
toward you i felt no sentiment but that of hatr unfeel
heartless creator you had endow me with percept and passion
and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind
but on you onli had i ani claim for piti and redress and from you i
determin to seek that justic which i vainli attempt to gain from
ani other be that wore the human form
my travel were long and the suffer i endur intens it wa
late in autumn when i quit the district where i had so long resid
i travel onli at night fear of encount the visag of a
human be natur decai around me and the sun becam heatless
rain and snow pour around me mighti river were frozen the surfac
of the earth wa hard and chill and bare and i found no shelter oh
earth how often did i imprec curs on the caus of my be the
mild of my natur had fled and all within me wa turn to gall
and bitter the nearer i approach to your habit the more
deepli did i feel the spirit of reveng enkindl in my heart snow
fell and the water were harden but i rest not a few incid
now and then direct me and i possess a map of the countri but i
often wander wide from my path the agoni of my feel allow me
no respit no incid occur from which my rage and miseri could
not extract it food but a circumst that happen when i arriv
on the confin of switzerland when the sun had recov it warmth
and the earth again began to look green confirm in an especi
manner the bitter and horror of my feel
i gener rest dure the dai and travel onli when i wa
secur by night from the view of man on morn howev find
that my path lai through a deep wood i ventur to continu my journei
after the sun had risen the dai which wa on of the first of spring
cheer even me by the loveli of it sunshin and the balmi of
the air i felt emot of gentl and pleasur that had long
appear dead reviv within me half surpris by the novelti of
these sensat i allow myself to be born awai by them and
forget my solitud and deform dare to be happi soft tear
again bedew my cheek and i even rais my humid ey with
thank toward the bless sun which bestow such joi upon me
i continu to wind among the path of the wood until i came to it
boundari which wa skirt by a deep and rapid river into which mani
of the tree bent their branch now bud with the fresh spring
here i paus not exactli know what path to pursu when i heard
the sound of voic that induc me to conceal myself under the shade
of a cypress i wa scarc hid when a young girl came run
toward the spot where i wa conceal laugh as if she ran from
someon in sport she continu her cours along the precipit side
of the river when suddenli her foot slip and she fell into the
rapid stream i rush from my hidingplac and with extrem labour
from the forc of the current save her and drag her to shore she
wa senseless and i endeavour by everi mean in my power to restor
anim when i wa suddenli interrupt by the approach of a rustic
who wa probabl the person from whom she had playfulli fled on
see me he dart toward me and tear the girl from my arm
hasten toward the deeper part of the wood i follow speedili i
hardli knew why but when the man saw me draw near he aim a gun
which he carri at my bodi and fire i sank to the ground and my
injur with increas swift escap into the wood
thi wa then the reward of my benevol i had save a human be
from destruct and as a recompens i now writh under the miser
pain of a wound which shatter the flesh and bone the feel of
kind and gentl which i had entertain but a few moment
befor gave place to hellish rage and gnash of teeth inflam by
pain i vow etern hatr and vengeanc to all mankind but the
agoni of my wound overcam me my puls paus and i faint
for some week i led a miser life in the wood endeavour to
cure the wound which i had receiv the ball had enter my shoulder
and i knew not whether it had remain there or pass through at ani
rate i had no mean of extract it my suffer were augment
also by the oppress sens of the injustic and ingratitud of their
inflict my daili vow rose for revengea deep and deadli reveng
such as would alon compens for the outrag and anguish i had
endur
after some week my wound heal and i continu my journei the
labour i endur were no longer to be allevi by the bright sun or
gentl breez of spring all joi wa but a mockeri which insult my
desol state and made me feel more painfulli that i wa not made for
the enjoy of pleasur
but my toil now drew near a close and in two month from thi time i
reach the environ of geneva
it wa even when i arriv and i retir to a hidingplac among
the field that surround it to medit in what manner i should appli
to you i wa oppress by fatigu and hunger and far too unhappi to
enjoi the gentl breez of even or the prospect of the sun set
behind the stupend mountain of jura
at thi time a slight sleep reliev me from the pain of reflect
which wa disturb by the approach of a beauti child who came
run into the recess i had chosen with all the sportiv of
infanc suddenli as i gaze on him an idea seiz me that thi
littl creatur wa unprejud and had live too short a time to have
imbib a horror of deform if therefor i could seiz him and
educ him as my companion and friend i should not be so desol in
thi peopl earth
urg by thi impuls i seiz on the boi as he pass and drew him
toward me as soon as he beheld my form he place hi hand befor
hi ey and utter a shrill scream i drew hi hand forcibl from hi
face and said child what is the mean of thi i do not intend to
hurt you listen to me
he struggl violent let me go he cri
monster ugli wretch you wish to eat me and tear me to piec you
ar an ogr let me go or i will tell my papa
boi you will never see your father again you must come with me

frankensteinh will punish you you dare not keep me
frankenstein you belong then to my enemyto him toward whom i have
sworn etern reveng you shall be my first victim
the child still struggl and load me with epithet which carri
despair to my heart i grasp hi throat to silenc him and in a
moment he lai dead at my feet
i gaze on my victim and my heart swell with exult and hellish
triumph clap my hand i exclaim i too can creat desol
my enemi is not invulner thi death will carri despair to him and
a thousand other miseri shall torment and destroi him
as i fix my ey on the child i saw someth glitter on hi
breast i took it it wa a portrait of a most love woman in spite
of my malign it soften and attract me for a few moment i
gaze with delight on her dark ey fring by deep lash and her
love lip but present my rage return i rememb that i wa
for ever depriv of the delight that such beauti creatur could
bestow and that she whose resembl i contempl would in
regard me have chang that air of divin benign to on
express of disgust and affright
can you wonder that such thought transport me with rage i onli
wonder that at that moment instead of vent my sensat in
exclam and agoni i did not rush among mankind and perish in the
attempt to destroi them
while i wa overcom by these feel i left the spot where i had
commit the murder and seek a more seclud hidingplac i
enter a barn which had appear to me to be empti a woman wa
sleep on some straw she wa young not inde so beauti as her
whose portrait i held but of an agreeabl aspect and bloom in the
loveli of youth and health here i thought is on of those whose
joyimpart smile ar bestow on all but me and then i bent over
her and whisper awak fairest thy lover is nearh who would
give hi life but to obtain on look of affect from thine ey my
belov awak
the sleeper stir a thrill of terror ran through me should she
inde awak and see me and curs me and denounc the murder thu
would she assuredli act if her darken ey open and she beheld me
the thought wa mad it stir the fiend within menot i but
she shall suffer the murder i have commit becaus i am for ever
rob of all that she could give me she shall aton the crime had
it sourc in her be her the punish thank to the lesson of
felix and the sanguinari law of man i had learn now to work
mischief i bent over her and place the portrait secur in on of
the fold of her dress she move again and i fled
for some dai i haunt the spot where these scene had taken place

work of your own hand shall i respect man when he condemn me let him
live with me in the interchang of kind and instead of injuri i would
bestow everi benefit upon him with tear of gratitud at hi accept

reveng my injuri if i cannot inspir love i will caus fear and
chiefli toward you my archenemi becaus my creator do i swear

i intend to reason thi passion is detriment to me for you do
not reflect that you ar the caus of it excess if ani be felt
emot of benevol toward me i should return them a hundr and a
hundredfold for that on creatur sake i would make peac with the

harmless and free from the miseri i now feel oh my creator make me

request
i wa move i shudder when i thought of the possibl consequ
of my consent but i felt that there wa some justic in hi argument
hi tale and the feel he now express prove him to be a creatur
of fine sensat and did i not as hi maker ow him all the portion
of happi that it wa in my power to bestow he saw my chang of
feel and continu
if you consent neither you nor ani other human be shall ever see
us again i will go to the vast wild of south america my food is not
that of man i do not destroi the lamb and the kid to glut my appetit
acorn and berri afford me suffici nourish my companion will
be of the same natur as myself and will be content with the same fare
we shall make our bed of dri leav the sun will shine on us as on
man and will ripen our food the pictur i present to you is peac
and human and you must feel that you could deni it onli in the
wanton of power and cruelti pitiless as you have been toward me
i now see compass in your ey let me seiz the favour moment
and persuad you to promis what i so ardent desir
you propos repli i to fly from the habit of
man to dwell in those wild where the beast of the field will be your
onli companion how can you who long for the love and sympathi of man
persever in thi exil you will return and again seek their kind and
you will meet with their detest your evil passion will be renew
and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruct
thi mai not be ceas to argu the point for i cannot consent
how inconst ar your feel but a moment ago you were move by
my represent and why do you again harden yourself to my complaint
i swear to you by the earth which i inhabit and by you that made me that
with the companion you bestow i will quit the neighbourhood of man and
dwell as it mai chanc in the most savag of place my evil passion
will have fled for i shall meet with sympathi my life will flow quietli
awai and in my dy moment i shall not curs my maker
hi word had a strang effect upon me i compassion him and
sometim felt a wish to consol him but when i look upon him when
i saw the filthi mass that move and talk my heart sicken and my
feel were alter to those of horror and hatr i tri to stifl
these sensat i thought that as i could not sympathis with him i
had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happi which
wa yet in my power to bestow
you swear i said to be harmless but have you not
alreadi shown a degre of malic that should reason make me distrust
you mai not even thi be a feint that will increas your triumph by
afford a wider scope for your reveng
how is thi i must not be trifl with and i demand an answer if
i have no ti and no affect hatr and vice must be my portion
the love of anoth will destroi the caus of my crime and i shall
becom a thing of whose exist everyon will be ignor my vice
ar the children of a forc solitud that i abhor and my virtu will
necessarili aris when i live in communion with an equal i shall feel
the affect of a sensit be and becom link to the chain of
exist and event from which i am now exclud
i paus some time to reflect on all he had relat and the variou
argument which he had emploi i thought of the promis of virtu which
he had displai on the open of hi exist and the subsequ blight
of all kindli feel by the loath and scorn which hi protector had
manifest toward him hi power and threat were not omit in my
calcul a creatur who could exist in the icecav of the glacier
and hide himself from pursuit among the ridg of inaccess precipic
wa a be possess faculti it would be vain to cope with after a
long paus of reflect i conclud that the justic due both to him and
my fellow creatur demand of me that i should compli with hi request
turn to him therefor i said
i consent to your demand on your solemn oath to quit europ for ever
and everi other place in the neighbourhood of man as soon as i shall
deliv into your hand a femal who will accompani you in your exil
i swear he cri by the sun and by the blue sky of
heaven and by the fire of love that burn my heart that if you grant my
prayer while thei exist you shall never behold me again depart to your
home and commenc your labour i shall watch their progress with
unutter anxieti and fear not but that when you ar readi i shall
appear
sai thi he suddenli quit me fear perhap of ani chang in
my sentiment i saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than
the flight of an eagl and quickli lost among the undul of the
sea of ic
hi tale had occupi the whole dai and the sun wa upon the verg of
the horizon when he depart i knew that i ought to hasten my descent
toward the vallei as i should soon be encompass in dark but my
heart wa heavi and my step slow the labour of wind among the
littl path of the mountain and fix my feet firmli as i advanc
perplex me occupi as i wa by the emot which the occurr
of the dai had produc night wa far advanc when i came to the
halfwai restingplac and seat myself besid the fountain the star
shone at interv as the cloud pass from over them the dark pine
rose befor me and everi here and there a broken tree lai on the
ground it wa a scene of wonder solemn and stir strang
thought within me i wept bitterli and clasp my hand in agoni i
exclaim oh star and cloud and wind ye ar all about to mock
me if ye realli piti me crush sensat and memori let me becom as
nought but if not depart depart and leav me in dark
these were wild and miser thought but i cannot describ to you
how the etern twinkl of the star weigh upon me and how i
listen to everi blast of wind as if it were a dull ugli siroc on it
wai to consum me
morn dawn befor i arriv at the villag of chamounix i took no
rest but return immedi to geneva even in my own heart i could
give no express to my sensationsthei weigh on me with a
mountain weight and their excess destroi my agoni beneath them
thu i return home and enter the hous present myself to the
famili my haggard and wild appear awok intens alarm but i
answer no question scarc did i speak i felt as if i were place
under a bana if i had no right to claim their sympathiesa if
never more might i enjoi companionship with them yet even thu i
love them to ador and to save them i resolv to dedic
myself to my most abhor task the prospect of such an occup
made everi other circumst of exist pass befor me like a dream

chapter 18
dai after dai week after week pass awai on my return to geneva and
i could not collect the courag to recomm my work i fear the
vengeanc of the disappoint fiend yet i wa unabl to overcom my
repugn to the task which wa enjoin me i found that i could not
compos a femal without again devot sever month to profound
studi and labori disquisit i had heard of some discoveri
have been made by an english philosoph the knowledg of which wa
materi to my success and i sometim thought of obtain my
father consent to visit england for thi purpos but i clung to
everi pretenc of delai and shrank from take the first step in an
undertak whose immedi necess began to appear less absolut to
me a chang inde had taken place in me my health which had
hitherto declin wa now much restor and my spirit when
uncheck by the memori of my unhappi promis rose proportion my
father saw thi chang with pleasur and he turn hi thought
toward the best method of erad the remain of my melancholi
which everi now and then would return by fit and with a devour
black overcast the approach sunshin at these moment i took
refug in the most perfect solitud i pass whole dai on the lake
alon in a littl boat watch the cloud and listen to the
rippl of the wave silent and listless but the fresh air and
bright sun seldom fail to restor me to some degre of composur and
on my return i met the salut of my friend with a readier smile
and a more cheer heart
it wa after my return from on of these rambl that my father
call me asid thu address me
i am happi to remark my dear son that you have resum your former
pleasur and seem to be return to yourself and yet you ar still
unhappi and still avoid our societi for some time i wa lost in
conjectur as to the caus of thi but yesterdai an idea struck me
and if it is well found i conjur you to avow it reserv on such a
point would be not onli useless but draw down trebl miseri on us all
i trembl violent at hi exordium and my father continu
i confess my son that i have alwai look forward to your

feel thu we shall assuredli be happi howev present event mai cast
a gloom over us but it is thi gloom which appear to have taken so
strong a hold of your mind that i wish to dissip tell me
therefor whether you object to an immedi solemnis of the

howev that i wish to dictat happi to you or that a delai on
your part would caus me ani seriou uneasi interpret my word
with candour and answer me i conjur you with confid and
sincer
i listen to my father in silenc and remain for some time incap
of offer ani repli i revolv rapidli in my mind a multitud of
thought and endeavour to arriv at some conclus ala to me
the idea of an immedi union with my elizabeth wa on of horror and
dismai i wa bound by a solemn promis which i had not yet fulfil
and dare not break or if i did what manifold miseri might not
impend over me and my devot famili could i enter into a festiv
with thi deadli weight yet hang round my neck and bow me to the
ground i must perform my engag and let the monster depart with
hi mate befor i allow myself to enjoi the delight of a union from
which i expect peac
i rememb also the necess impos upon me of either journei to
england or enter into a long correspond with those philosoph
of that countri whose knowledg and discoveri were of indispens
us to me in my present undertak the latter method of obtain
the desir intellig wa dilatori and unsatisfactori besid i
had an insurmount avers to the idea of engag myself in my
loathsom task in my father hous while in habit of familiar
intercours with those i love i knew that a thousand fear
accid might occur the slightest of which would disclos a tale to
thrill all connect with me with horror i wa awar also that i
should often lose all selfcommand all capac of hide the
harrow sensat that would possess me dure the progress of my
unearthli occup i must absent myself from all i love while thu
emploi onc commenc it would quickli be achiev and i might be
restor to my famili in peac and happi my promis fulfil
the monster would depart for ever or so my fond fanci imag some
accid might meanwhil occur to destroi him and put an end to my
slaveri for ever
these feel dictat my answer to my father i express a wish to
visit england but conceal the true reason of thi request i
cloth my desir under a guis which excit no suspicion while i
urg my desir with an earnest that easili induc my father to
compli after so long a period of an absorb melancholi that
resembl mad in it intens and effect he wa glad to find
that i wa capabl of take pleasur in the idea of such a journei
and he hope that chang of scene and vari amus would befor my
return have restor me entir to myself
the durat of my absenc wa left to my own choic a few month or
at most a year wa the period contempl on patern kind
precaut he had taken to ensur my have a companion without
previous commun with me he had in concert with elizabeth
arrang that clerval should join me at strasburgh thi interf
with the solitud i covet for the prosecut of my task yet at the
commenc of my journei the presenc of my friend could in no wai be
an impedi and truli i rejoic that thu i should be save mani
hour of lone madden reflect nai henri might stand between
me and the intrus of my foe if i were alon would he not at time
forc hi abhor presenc on me to remind me of my task or to
contempl it progress
to england therefor i wa bound and it wa understood that my union
with elizabeth should take place immedi on my return my father
ag render him extrem avers to delai for myself there wa on
reward i promis myself from my detest toilson consol for my
unparallel suffer it wa the prospect of that dai when
enfranchis from my miser slaveri i might claim elizabeth and
forget the past in my union with her
i now made arrang for my journei but on feel haunt me
which fill me with fear and agit dure my absenc i should
leav my friend unconsci of the exist of their enemi and
unprotect from hi attack exasper as he might be by my
departur but he had promis to follow me wherev i might go and
would he not accompani me to england thi imagin wa dread in
itself but sooth inasmuch as it suppos the safeti of my friend
i wa agonis with the idea of the possibl that the revers of
thi might happen but through the whole period dure which i wa the
slave of my creatur i allow myself to be govern by the impuls of
the moment and my present sensat strongli intim that the fiend
would follow me and exempt my famili from the danger of hi
machin
it wa in the latter end of septemb that i again quit my nativ
countri my journei had been my own suggest and elizabeth
therefor acquiesc but she wa fill with disquiet at the idea of
my suffer awai from her the inroad of miseri and grief it had
been her care which provid me a companion in clervaland yet a man
is blind to a thousand minut circumst which call forth a woman
sedul attent she long to bid me hasten my return a thousand
conflict emot render her mute as she bade me a tear silent
farewel
i threw myself into the carriag that wa to convei me awai hardli
know whither i wa go and careless of what wa pass around
i rememb onli and it wa with a bitter anguish that i reflect on
it to order that my chemic instrument should be pack to go with
me fill with dreari imagin i pass through mani beauti
and majest scene but my ey were fix and unobserv i could
onli think of the bourn of my travel and the work which wa to occupi
me whilst thei endur
after some dai spent in listless indol dure which i travers
mani leagu i arriv at strasburgh where i wait two dai for
clerval he came ala how great wa the contrast between us he
wa aliv to everi new scene joy when he saw the beauti of the
set sun and more happi when he beheld it rise and recomm a new
dai he point out to me the shift colour of the landscap and
the appear of the sky thi is what it is to live he cri
now i enjoi exist but you my dear frankenstein wherefor ar
you despond and sorrow in truth i wa occupi by gloomi
thought and neither saw the descent of the even star nor the golden
sunris reflect in the rhine and you my friend would be far more
amus with the journal of clerval who observ the sceneri with an
ey of feel and delight than in listen to my reflect i a
miser wretch haunt by a curs that shut up everi avenu to
enjoy
we had agre to descend the rhine in a boat from strasburgh to
rotterdam whenc we might take ship for london dure thi
voyag we pass mani willowi island and saw sever beauti town
we stai a dai at mannheim and on the fifth from our departur from
strasburgh arriv at mainz the cours of the rhine below mainz
becom much more picturesqu the river descend rapidli and wind
between hill not high but steep and of beauti form we saw
mani ruin castl stand on the edg of precipic surround by
black wood high and inaccess thi part of the rhine inde
present a singularli varieg landscap in on spot you view
rug hill ruin castl overlook tremend precipic with
the dark rhine rush beneath and on the sudden turn of a promontori
flourish vineyard with green slope bank and a meander river
and popul town occupi the scene
we travel at the time of the vintag and heard the song of the labour
as we glide down the stream even i depress in mind and my spirit
continu agit by gloomi feel even i wa pleas i lai at the
bottom of the boat and as i gaze on the cloudless blue sky i seem to
drink in a tranquil to which i had long been a stranger and if these
were my sensat who can describ those of henri he felt as if he had
been transport to fairyland and enjoi a happi seldom tast by
man i have seen he said the most beauti scene
of my own countri i have visit the lake of lucern and uri where the
snowi mountain descend almost perpendicularli to the water cast black
and impenetr shade which would caus a gloomi and mourn appear
were it not for the most verdant island that reliev the ey by their gai
appear i have seen thi lake agit by a tempest when the wind tore
up whirlwind of water and gave you an idea of what the waterspout must be
on the great ocean and the wave dash with furi the base of the mountain
where the priest and hi mistress were overwhelm by an avalanch and
where their dy voic ar still said to be heard amid the paus of the
nightli wind i have seen the mountain of la valai and the pai de vaud

that group of labour come from among their vine and that villag
half hid in the recess of the mountain oh sure the spirit that inhabit

i shall soon ceas to bea miser spectacl of wreck human
pitiabl to other and intoler to myself
we pass a consider period at oxford rambl among it environ
and endeavour to identifi everi spot which might relat to the most
anim epoch of english histori our littl voyag of discoveri
were often prolong by the success object that present
themselv we visit the tomb of the illustri hampden and the
field on which that patriot fell for a moment my soul wa elev
from it debas and miser fear to contempl the divin idea
of liberti and selfsacrific of which these sight were the monument
and the remembranc for an instant i dare to shake off my chain
and look around me with a free and lofti spirit but the iron had eaten
into my flesh and i sank again trembl and hopeless into my
miser self
we left oxford with regret and proceed to matlock which wa our next
place of rest the countri in the neighbourhood of thi villag
resembl to a greater degre the sceneri of switzerland but
everyth is on a lower scale and the green hill want the crown of
distant white alp which alwai attend on the pini mountain of my
nativ countri we visit the wondrou cave and the littl cabinet
of natur histori where the curios ar dispos in the same
manner as in the collect at servox and chamounix the latter name
made me trembl when pronounc by henri and i hasten to quit
matlock with which that terribl scene wa thu associ
from derbi still journei northward we pass two month in
cumberland and westmorland i could now almost fanci myself among the
swiss mountain the littl patch of snow which yet linger on the
northern side of the mountain the lake and the dash of the
rocki stream were all familiar and dear sight to me here also we
made some acquaint who almost contriv to cheat me into
happi the delight of clerval wa proportion greater than
mine hi mind expand in the compani of men of talent and he found
in hi own natur greater capac and resourc than he could have
imagin himself to have possess while he associ with hi
inferior i could pass my life here said he to me and among
these mountain i should scarc regret switzerland and the rhine
but he found that a travel life is on that includ much pain
amidst it enjoy hi feel ar for ever on the stretch and
when he begin to sink into repos he find himself oblig to quit
that on which he rest in pleasur for someth new which again
engag hi attent and which also he forsak for other novelti
we had scarc visit the variou lake of cumberland and westmorland
and conceiv an affect for some of the inhabit when the period
of our appoint with our scotch friend approach and we left them
to travel on for my own part i wa not sorri i had now neglect my
promis for some time and i fear the effect of the dmon
disappoint he might remain in switzerland and wreak hi vengeanc
on my rel thi idea pursu me and torment me at everi moment
from which i might otherwis have snatch repos and peac i wait
for my letter with feverish impati if thei were delai i wa
miser and overcom by a thousand fear and when thei arriv and i
saw the superscript of elizabeth or my father i hardli dare to
read and ascertain my fate sometim i thought that the fiend
follow me and might expedit my remiss by murder my companion
when these thought possess me i would not quit henri for a moment
but follow him as hi shadow to protect him from the fanci rage of
hi destroy i felt as if i had commit some great crime the
conscious of which haunt me i wa guiltless but i had inde
drawn down a horribl curs upon my head as mortal as that of crime
i visit edinburgh with languid ey and mind and yet that citi might
have interest the most unfortun be clerval did not like it so well
as oxford for the antiqu of the latter citi wa more pleas to him
but the beauti and regular of the new town of edinburgh it romant
castl and it environ the most delight in the world arthur
seat st bernard well and the pentland hill compens him for
the chang and fill him with cheer and admir but i wa
impati to arriv at the termin of my journei
we left edinburgh in a week pass through coupar st andrew and
along the bank of the tai to perth where our friend expect us
but i wa in no mood to laugh and talk with stranger or enter into
their feel or plan with the good humour expect from a guest and
accordingli i told clerval that i wish to make the tour of scotland
alon do you said i enjoi yourself and let thi be our
rendezv i mai be absent a month or two but do not interfer with
my motion i entreat you leav me to peac and solitud for a short
time and when i return i hope it will be with a lighter heart more
congeni to your own temper
henri wish to dissuad me but see me bent on thi plan ceas to
remonstr he entreat me to write often i had rather be with
you he said in your solitari rambl than with these scotch
peopl whom i do not know hasten then my dear friend to return
that i mai again feel myself somewhat at home which i cannot do in
your absenc
have part from my friend i determin to visit some remot spot of
scotland and finish my work in solitud i did not doubt but that the
monster follow me and would discov himself to me when i should have
finish that he might receiv hi companion
with thi resolut i travers the northern highland and fix on on of
the remotest of the orknei as the scene of my labour it wa a place
fit for such a work be hardli more than a rock whose high side were
continu beaten upon by the wave the soil wa barren scarc
afford pastur for a few miser cow and oatmeal for it
inhabit which consist of five person whose gaunt and scraggi limb
gave token of their miser fare veget and bread when thei
indulg in such luxuri and even fresh water wa to be procur from
the mainland which wa about five mile distant
on the whole island there were but three miser hut and on of
these wa vacant when i arriv thi i hire it contain but two
room and these exhibit all the squalid of the most miser
penuri the thatch had fallen in the wall were unplast and the
door wa off it hing i order it to be repair bought some
furnitur and took possess an incid which would doubtless have
occas some surpris had not all the sens of the cottag been
benumb by want and squalid poverti as it wa i live ungaz at
and unmolest hardli thank for the pittanc of food and cloth
which i gave so much doe suffer blunt even the coarsest sensat
of men
in thi retreat i devot the morn to labour but in the even
when the weather permit i walk on the stoni beach of the sea to
listen to the wave as thei roar and dash at my feet it wa a
monoton yet everchang scene i thought of switzerland it wa
far differ from thi desol and appal landscap it hill
ar cover with vine and it cottag ar scatter thickli in the
plain it fair lake reflect a blue and gentl sky and when
troubl by the wind their tumult is but as the plai of a live
infant when compar to the roar of the giant ocean
in thi manner i distribut my occup when i first arriv but
as i proceed in my labour it becam everi dai more horribl and
irksom to me sometim i could not prevail on myself to enter my
laboratori for sever dai and at other time i toil dai and night
in order to complet my work it wa inde a filthi process in
which i wa engag dure my first experi a kind of
enthusiast frenzi had blind me to the horror of my employ my
mind wa intent fix on the consumm of my labour and my ey
were shut to the horror of my proceed but now i went to it in
cold blood and my heart often sicken at the work of my hand
thu situat emploi in the most detest occup immers in
a solitud where noth could for an instant call my attent from
the actual scene in which i wa engag my spirit becam unequ i
grew restless and nervou everi moment i fear to meet my
persecutor sometim i sat with my ey fix on the ground fear
to rais them lest thei should encount the object which i so much
dread to behold i fear to wander from the sight of my fellow
creatur lest when alon he should come to claim hi companion
in the mean time i work on and my labour wa alreadi consider
advanc i look toward it complet with a tremul and eager
hope which i dare not trust myself to question but which wa
intermix with obscur forebod of evil that made my heart sicken
in my bosom
chapter 20
i sat on even in my laboratori the sun had set and the moon wa just
rise from the sea i had not suffici light for my employ and i
remain idl in a paus of consider of whether i should leav my
labour for the night or hasten it conclus by an unremit attent
to it as i sat a train of reflect occur to me which led me to
consid the effect of what i wa now do three year befor i wa
engag in the same manner and had creat a fiend whose unparallel
barbar had desol my heart and fill it for ever with the bitterest
remors i wa now about to form anoth be of whose disposit i wa
alik ignor she might becom ten thousand time more malign than her
mate and delight for it own sake in murder and wretched he had
sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in desert but she
had not and she who in all probabl wa to becom a think and
reason anim might refus to compli with a compact made befor her
creation thei might even hate each other the creatur who alreadi live
loath hi own deform and might he not conceiv a greater abhorr
for it when it came befor hi ey in the femal form she also might turn
with disgust from him to the superior beauti of man she might quit him
and he be again alon exasper by the fresh provoc of be
desert by on of hi own speci
even if thei were to leav europ and inhabit the desert of the new world
yet on of the first result of those sympathi for which the dmon
thirst would be children and a race of devil would be propag upon
the earth who might make the veri exist of the speci of man a
condit precari and full of terror had i right for my own benefit
to inflict thi curs upon everlast gener i had befor been move
by the sophism of the be i had creat i had been struck senseless by
hi fiendish threat but now for the first time the wicked of my
promis burst upon me i shudder to think that futur ag might curs me
as their pest whose selfish had not hesit to bui it own peac at
the price perhap of the exist of the whole human race
i trembl and my heart fail within me when on look up i saw by
the light of the moon the dmon at the casement a ghastli grin
wrinkl hi lip as he gaze on me where i sat fulfil the task
which he had allot to me ye he had follow me in my travel he
had loiter in forest hid himself in cave or taken refug in wide
and desert heath and he now came to mark my progress and claim the
fulfil of my promis
as i look on him hi counten express the utmost extent of
malic and treacheri i thought with a sensat of mad on my
promis of creat anoth like to him and trembl with passion
tore to piec the thing on which i wa engag the wretch saw me
destroi the creatur on whose futur exist he depend for
happi and with a howl of devilish despair and reveng withdrew
i left the room and lock the door made a solemn vow in my own
heart never to resum my labour and then with trembl step i
sought my own apart i wa alon none were near me to dissip
the gloom and reliev me from the sicken oppress of the most
terribl reveri
sever hour pass and i remain near my window gaze on the sea
it wa almost motionless for the wind were hush and all natur
repos under the ey of the quiet moon a few fish vessel alon
speck the water and now and then the gentl breez waft the sound
of voic as the fishermen call to on anoth i felt the silenc
although i wa hardli consciou of it extrem profund until my ear
wa suddenli arrest by the paddl of oar near the shore and a
person land close to my hous
in a few minut after i heard the creak of my door as if some on
endeavour to open it softli i trembl from head to foot i felt a
presenti of who it wa and wish to rous on of the peasant who
dwelt in a cottag not far from mine but i wa overcom by the sensat
of helpless so often felt in fright dream when you in vain
endeavour to fly from an impend danger and wa root to the spot
present i heard the sound of footstep along the passag the door
open and the wretch whom i dread appear shut the door he
approach me and said in a smother voic
you have destroi the work which you began what is it that you
intend do you dare to break your promis i have endur toil and miseri
i left switzerland with you i crept along the shore of the rhine among
it willow island and over the summit of it hill i have dwelt mani
month in the heath of england and among the desert of scotland i have
endur incalcul fatigu and cold and hunger do you dare destroi my
hope

dai will be hate to you you ar my creator but i am your master
obei
the hour of my irresolut is past and the period of your power is
arriv your threat cannot move me to do an act of wicked but
thei confirm me in a determin of not creat you a companion in
vice shall i in cool blood set loos upon the earth a dmon whose
delight is in death and wretched begon i am firm and your
word will onli exasper my rage
the monster saw my determin in my face and gnash hi teeth in the
impot of anger shall each man cri he find a
wife for hi bosom and each beast have hi mate and i be alon i had
feel of affect and thei were requit by detest and scorn
man you mai hate but bewar your hour will pass in dread and miseri
and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happi for
ever ar you to be happi while i grovel in the intens of my
wretched you can blast my other passion but reveng
remainsreveng henceforth dearer than light or food i mai die but
first you my tyrant and tormentor shall curs the sun that gaze on your
miseri bewar for i am fearless and therefor power i will watch with
the wili of a snake that i mai sting with it venom man you shall

weddingnight
i start forward and exclaim villain befor you sign my
deathwarr be sure that you ar yourself safe
i would have seiz him but he elud me and quit the hous with
precipit in a few moment i saw him in hi boat which shot
across the water with an arrowi swift and wa soon lost amidst the
wave
all wa again silent but hi word rang in my ear i burn with rage to
pursu the murder of my peac and precipit him into the ocean i
walk up and down my room hastili and perturb while my imagin
conjur up a thousand imag to torment and sting me why had i not
follow him and close with him in mortal strife but i had suffer him
to depart and he had direct hi cours toward the mainland i shudder
to think who might be the next victim sacrif to hi insati reveng
and then i thought again of hi wordsi will be with you on
your weddingnight that then wa the period fix for the
fulfil of my destini in that hour i should die and at onc satisfi and
extinguish hi malic the prospect did not move me to fear yet when i
thought of my belov elizabeth of her tear and endless sorrow when she
should find her lover so barbar snatch from her tear the first i
had shed for mani month stream from my ey and i resolv not to fall
befor my enemi without a bitter struggl
the night pass awai and the sun rose from the ocean my feel becam
calmer if it mai be call calm when the violenc of rage sink into
the depth of despair i left the hous the horrid scene of the last
night content and walk on the beach of the sea which i
almost regard as an insuper barrier between me and my fellow
creatur nai a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me i
desir that i might pass my life on that barren rock wearili it is true
but uninterrupt by ani sudden shock of miseri if i return it wa to
be sacrif or to see those whom i most love die under the grasp of a
dmon whom i had myself creat
i walk about the isl like a restless spectr separ from all it
love and miser in the separ when it becam noon and the
sun rose higher i lai down on the grass and wa overpow by a deep
sleep i had been awak the whole of the preced night my nerv
were agit and my ey inflam by watch and miseri the sleep
into which i now sank refresh me and when i awok i again felt as
if i belong to a race of human be like myself and i began to
reflect upon what had pass with greater composur yet still the
word of the fiend rang in my ear like a deathknel thei appear
like a dream yet distinct and oppress as a realiti
the sun had far descend and i still sat on the shore satisfi my
appetit which had becom raven with an oaten cake when i saw a
fishingboat land close to me and on of the men brought me a packet
it contain letter from geneva and on from clerval entreat me to
join him he said that he wa wear awai hi time fruitlessli where
he wa that letter from the friend he had form in london desir
hi return to complet the negoti thei had enter into for hi
indian enterpris he could not ani longer delai hi departur but as
hi journei to london might be follow even sooner than he now
conjectur by hi longer voyag he entreat me to bestow as much of
my societi on him as i could spare he besought me therefor to
leav my solitari isl and to meet him at perth that we might proce
southward togeth thi letter in a degre recal me to life and
i determin to quit my island at the expir of two dai
yet befor i depart there wa a task to perform on which i shudder
to reflect i must pack up my chemic instrument and for that purpos i
must enter the room which had been the scene of my odiou work and i must
handl those utensil the sight of which wa sicken to me the next
morn at daybreak i summon suffici courag and unlock the door
of my laboratori the remain of the halffinish creatur whom i had
destroi lai scatter on the floor and i almost felt as if i had
mangl the live flesh of a human be i paus to collect myself and
then enter the chamber with trembl hand i convei the instrument
out of the room but i reflect that i ought not to leav the relic of my
work to excit the horror and suspicion of the peasant and i accordingli
put them into a basket with a great quantiti of stone and lai them
up determin to throw them into the sea that veri night and in the
meantim i sat upon the beach emploi in clean and arrang my
chemic apparatu
noth could be more complet than the alter that had taken place
in my feel sinc the night of the appear of the dmon i had
befor regard my promis with a gloomi despair as a thing that with
whatev consequ must be fulfil but i now felt as if a film
had been taken from befor my ey and that i for the first time saw
clearli the idea of renew my labour did not for on instant occur
to me the threat i had heard weigh on my thought but i did not
reflect that a voluntari act of mine could avert it i had resolv in
my own mind that to creat anoth like the fiend i had first made
would be an act of the basest and most atroci selfish and i
banish from my mind everi thought that could lead to a differ
conclus
between two and three in the morn the moon rose and i then put my
basket aboard a littl skiff sail out about four mile from the shore
the scene wa perfectli solitari a few boat were return toward land
but i sail awai from them i felt as if i wa about the commiss of a
dread crime and avoid with shudder anxieti ani encount with my
fellow creatur at on time the moon which had befor been clear wa
suddenli overspread by a thick cloud and i took advantag of the moment of
dark and cast my basket into the sea i listen to the gurgl sound
as it sank and then sail awai from the spot the sky becam cloud but
the air wa pure although chill by the northeast breez that wa then
rise but it refresh me and fill me with such agreeabl sensat
that i resolv to prolong my stai on the water and fix the rudder in a
direct posit stretch myself at the bottom of the boat cloud hid the
moon everyth wa obscur and i heard onli the sound of the boat as it
keel cut through the wave the murmur lull me and in a short time i
slept soundli
i do not know how long i remain in thi situat but when i awok i
found that the sun had alreadi mount consider the wind wa high and
the wave continu threaten the safeti of my littl skiff i found
that the wind wa northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from
which i had embark i endeavour to chang my cours but quickli found
that if i again made the attempt the boat would be instantli fill with
water thu situat my onli resourc wa to drive befor the wind i
confess that i felt a few sensat of terror i had no compass with me
and wa so slenderli acquaint with the geographi of thi part of the
world that the sun wa of littl benefit to me i might be driven into the
wide atlant and feel all the tortur of starvat or be swallow up in
the immeasur water that roar and buffet around me i had alreadi
been out mani hour and felt the torment of a burn thirst a prelud to
my other suffer i look on the heaven which were cover by cloud
that flew befor the wind onli to be replac by other i look upon the
sea it wa to be my grave fiend i exclaim your
task is alreadi fulfil i thought of elizabeth of my father and
of clervalal left behind on whom the monster might satisfi hi
sanguinari and merciless passion thi idea plung me into a reveri so
despair and fright that even now when the scene is on the point of
close befor me for ever i shudder to reflect on it
some hour pass thu but by degre as the sun declin toward the
horizon the wind di awai into a gentl breez and the sea becam
free from breaker but these gave place to a heavi swell i felt sick
and hardli abl to hold the rudder when suddenli i saw a line of high
land toward the south
almost spent as i wa by fatigu and the dread suspens i endur
for sever hour thi sudden certainti of life rush like a flood of
warm joi to my heart and tear gush from my ey
how mutabl ar our feel and how strang is that cling love we have
of life even in the excess of miseri i construct anoth sail with a
part of my dress and eagerli steer my cours toward the land it had a
wild and rocki appear but as i approach nearer i easili perceiv
the trace of cultiv i saw vessel near the shore and found myself
suddenli transport back to the neighbourhood of civilis man i
carefulli trace the wind of the land and hail a steepl which i at
length saw issu from behind a small promontori as i wa in a state of
extrem debil i resolv to sail directli toward the town as a place
where i could most easili procur nourish fortun i had monei with
me as i turn the promontori i perceiv a small neat town and a good
harbour which i enter my heart bound with joi at my unexpect
escap
as i wa occupi in fix the boat and arrang the sail sever
peopl crowd toward the spot thei seem much surpris at my
appear but instead of offer me ani assist whisper
togeth with gestur that at ani other time might have produc in me
a slight sensat of alarm as it wa i mere remark that thei
spoke english and i therefor address them in that languag my
good friend said i will you be so kind as to tell me the name of
thi town and inform me where i am
you will know that soon enough repli a man with a hoars voic
mayb you ar come to a place that will not prove much to your tast
but you will not be consult as to your quarter i promis you
i wa exceedingli surpris on receiv so rude an answer from a
stranger and i wa also disconcert on perceiv the frown and
angri counten of hi companion why do you answer me so
roughli i repli sure it is not the custom of englishmen to

while thi strang dialogu continu i perceiv the crowd rapidli
increas their face express a mixtur of curios and anger which

and wa led to on of the best hous in the town i wa readi to sink from
fatigu and hunger but be surround by a crowd i thought it polit
to rous all my strength that no physic debil might be constru into
apprehens or consciou guilt littl did i then expect the calam that

all fear of ignomini or death
i must paus here for it requir all my fortitud to recal the memori of
the fright event which i am about to relat in proper detail to my

chapter 21
i wa soon introduc into the presenc of the magistr an old
benevol man with calm and mild manner he look upon me howev
with some degre of sever and then turn toward my conductor
he ask who appear as wit on thi occas
about half a dozen men came forward and on be select by the
magistr he depos that he had been out fish the night befor with
hi son and brotherinlaw daniel nugent when about ten oclock
thei observ a strong northerli blast rise and thei accordingli put in
for port it wa a veri dark night as the moon had not yet risen thei did
not land at the harbour but as thei had been accustom at a creek about
two mile below he walk on first carri a part of the fish tackl
and hi companion follow him at some distanc as he wa proceed
along the sand he struck hi foot against someth and fell at hi
length on the ground hi companion came up to assist him and by the
light of their lantern thei found that he had fallen on the bodi of a man
who wa to all appear dead their first supposit wa that it wa the
corps of some person who had been drown and wa thrown on shore by the
wave but on examin thei found that the cloth were not wet and even
that the bodi wa not then cold thei instantli carri it to the cottag
of an old woman near the spot and endeavour but in vain to restor it
to life it appear to be a handsom young man about five and twenti
year of ag he had appar been strangl for there wa no sign of
ani violenc except the black mark of finger on hi neck
the first part of thi deposit did not in the least interest me but
when the mark of the finger wa mention i rememb the murder of
my brother and felt myself extrem agit my limb trembl and a
mist came over my ey which oblig me to lean on a chair for
support the magistr observ me with a keen ey and of cours drew
an unfavour auguri from my manner
the son confirm hi father account but when daniel nugent wa
call he swore posit that just befor the fall of hi companion he
saw a boat with a singl man in it at a short distanc from the shore
and as far as he could judg by the light of a few star it wa the same
boat in which i had just land
a woman depos that she live near the beach and wa stand at the door
of her cottag wait for the return of the fishermen about an hour
befor she heard of the discoveri of the bodi when she saw a boat with
onli on man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corps
wa afterward found
anoth woman confirm the account of the fishermen have brought the
bodi into her hous it wa not cold thei put it into a bed and
rub it and daniel went to the town for an apothecari but life wa
quit gone
sever other men were examin concern my land and thei agre
that with the strong north wind that had arisen dure the night it
wa veri probabl that i had beaten about for mani hour and had been
oblig to return nearli to the same spot from which i had depart
besid thei observ that it appear that i had brought the bodi
from anoth place and it wa like that as i did not appear to know
the shore i might have put into the harbour ignor of the distanc
of the town of from the place where i had deposit the corps
mr kirwin on hear thi evid desir that i should be taken into
the room where the bodi lai for inter that it might be observ what
effect the sight of it would produc upon me thi idea wa probabl
suggest by the extrem agit i had exhibit when the mode of the
murder had been describ i wa accordingli conduct by the magistr
and sever other person to the inn i could not help be struck by the
strang coincid that had taken place dure thi event night but
know that i had been convers with sever person in the island i had
inhabit about the time that the bodi had been found i wa perfectli
tranquil as to the consequ of the affair
i enter the room where the corps lai and wa led up to the coffin how
can i describ my sensat on behold it i feel yet parch with
horror nor can i reflect on that terribl moment without shudder and
agoni the examin the presenc of the magistr and wit
pass like a dream from my memori when i saw the lifeless form of henri
clerval stretch befor me i gasp for breath and throw myself on
the bodi i exclaim have my murder machin depriv you
also my dearest henri of life two i have alreadi destroi other
victim await their destini but you clerval my friend my
benefactor
the human frame could no longer support the agoni that i endur and
i wa carri out of the room in strong convuls
a fever succeed to thi i lai for two month on the point of death my
rave as i afterward heard were fright i call myself the
murder of william of justin and of clerval sometim i entreat my
attend to assist me in the destruct of the fiend by whom i wa
torment and at other i felt the finger of the monster alreadi grasp
my neck and scream aloud with agoni and terror fortun as i spoke
my nativ languag mr kirwin alon understood me but my gestur and
bitter cri were suffici to affright the other wit
why did i not die more miser than man ever wa befor why did i not
sink into forget and rest death snatch awai mani bloom
children the onli hope of their dote parent how mani bride and
youth lover have been on dai in the bloom of health and hope and the
next a prei for worm and the decai of the tomb of what materi wa i
made that i could thu resist so mani shock which like the turn of
the wheel continu renew the tortur
but i wa doom to live and in two month found myself as awak from
a dream in a prison stretch on a wretch bed surround by
gaoler turnkei bolt and all the miser apparatu of a dungeon
it wa morn i rememb when i thu awok to understand i had
forgotten the particular of what had happen and onli felt as if some
great misfortun had suddenli overwhelm me but when i look around
and saw the bar window and the squalid of the room in which i
wa all flash across my memori and i groan bitterli
thi sound disturb an old woman who wa sleep in a chair besid
me she wa a hire nurs the wife of on of the turnkei and her
counten express all those bad qualiti which often characteris
that class the line of her face were hard and rude like that of
person accustom to see without sympathis in sight of miseri her
tone express her entir indiffer she address me in english
and the voic struck me as on that i had heard dure my suffer
ar you better now sir said she
i repli in the same languag with a feebl voic i believ i am
but if it be all true if inde i did not dream i am sorri that i am
still aliv to feel thi miseri and horror
for that matter repli the old woman if you mean about the
gentleman you murder i believ that it were better for you if you
were dead for i fanci it will go hard with you howev that none
of my busi i am sent to nurs you and get you well i do my duti
with a safe conscienc it were well if everybodi did the same
i turn with loath from the woman who could utter so unfeel a
speech to a person just save on the veri edg of death but i felt
languid and unabl to reflect on all that had pass the whole seri
of my life appear to me as a dream i sometim doubt if inde it
were all true for it never present itself to my mind with the forc
of realiti
as the imag that float befor me becam more distinct i grew
feverish a dark press around me no on wa near me who sooth
me with the gentl voic of love no dear hand support me the
physician came and prescrib medicin and the old woman prepar
them for me but utter careless wa visibl in the first and the
express of brutal wa strongli mark in the visag of the
second who could be interest in the fate of a murder but the
hangman who would gain hi fee
these were my first reflect but i soon learn that mr kirwin had
shown me extrem kind he had caus the best room in the prison
to be prepar for me wretch inde wa the best and it wa he who
had provid a physician and a nurs it is true he seldom came to
see me for although he ardent desir to reliev the suffer of
everi human creatur he did not wish to be present at the agoni and
miser rave of a murder he came therefor sometim to see
that i wa not neglect but hi visit were short and with long
interv
on dai while i wa gradual recov i wa seat in a chair my ey
half open and my cheek livid like those in death i wa overcom by gloom
and miseri and often reflect i had better seek death than desir to
remain in a world which to me wa replet with wretched at on time i
consid whether i should not declar myself guilti and suffer the
penalti of the law less innoc than poor justin had been such were my
thought when the door of my apart wa open and mr kirwin enter
hi counten express sympathi and compass he drew a chair close to
mine and address me in french
i fear that thi place is veri shock to you can i do anyth to
make you more comfort
i thank you but all that you mention is noth to me on the whole
earth there is no comfort which i am capabl of receiv
i know that the sympathi of a stranger can be but of littl relief to
on born down as you ar by so strang a misfortun but you will i
hope soon quit thi melancholi abod for doubtless evid can
easili be brought to free you from the crimin charg
that is my least concern i am by a cours of strang event becom
the most miser of mortal persecut and tortur as i am and
have been can death be ani evil to me
noth inde could be more unfortun and agonis than the
strang chanc that have late occur you were thrown by some
surpris accid on thi shore renown for it hospit
seiz immedi and charg with murder the first sight that wa
present to your ey wa the bodi of your friend murder in so
unaccount a manner and place as it were by some fiend across
your path
as mr kirwin said thi notwithstand the agit i endur on
thi retrospect of my suffer i also felt consider surpris at
the knowledg he seem to possess concern me i suppos some
astonish wa exhibit in my counten for mr kirwin hasten
to sai

discov from it commenc to be from your father i instantli wrote
to geneva nearli two month have elaps sinc the departur of my letter
but you ar ill even now you trembl you ar unfit for agit of ani
kind
thi suspens is a thousand time wors than the most horribl event
tell me what new scene of death ha been act and whose murder i am
now to lament
your famili is perfectli well said mr kirwin with
gentl and someon a friend is come to visit you
i know not by what chain of thought the idea present itself but it
instantli dart into my mind that the murder had come to mock at my
miseri and taunt me with the death of clerval as a new incit for
me to compli with hi hellish desir i put my hand befor my ey
and cri out in agoni
oh take him awai i cannot see him for god sake do not
let him enter
mr kirwin regard me with a troubl counten he could not help
regard my exclam as a presumpt of my guilt and said in
rather a sever tone
i should have thought young man that the presenc of your father
would have been welcom instead of inspir such violent repugn
my father cri i while everi featur and everi muscl wa relax
from anguish to pleasur is my father inde come how kind how
veri kind but where is he why doe he not hasten to me
my chang of manner surpris and pleas the magistr perhap he
thought that my former exclam wa a momentari return of delirium
and now he instantli resum hi former benevol he rose and
quit the room with my nurs and in a moment my father enter it
noth at thi moment could have given me greater pleasur than the
arriv of my father i stretch out my hand to him and cri
ar you then safeand elizabethand ernest
my father calm me with assur of their welfar and endeavour by
dwell on these subject so interest to my heart to rais my
despond spirit but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abod of
cheer what a place is thi that you inhabit my son
said he look mournfulli at the bar window and wretch appear
of the room you travel to seek happi but a fatal seem
to pursu you and poor clerval
the name of my unfortun and murder friend wa an agit too
great to be endur in my weak state i shed tear
ala ye my father repli i some destini of the
most horribl kind hang over me and i must live to fulfil it or sure i
should have di on the coffin of henri
we were not allow to convers for ani length of time for the
precari state of my health render everi precaut necessari that
could ensur tranquil mr kirwin came in and insist that my
strength should not be exhaust by too much exert but the
appear of my father wa to me like that of my good angel and i
gradual recov my health
as my sick quit me i wa absorb by a gloomi and black
melancholi that noth could dissip the imag of clerval wa
for ever befor me ghastli and murder more than onc the agit
into which these reflect threw me made my friend dread a danger
relaps ala why did thei preserv so miser and detest a
life it wa sure that i might fulfil my destini which is now
draw to a close soon oh veri soon will death extinguish these
throb and reliev me from the mighti weight of anguish that bear
me to the dust and in execut the award of justic i shall also
sink to rest then the appear of death wa distant although the
wish wa ever present to my thought and i often sat for hour
motionless and speechless wish for some mighti revolut that
might buri me and my destroy in it ruin
the season of the assiz approach i had alreadi been three month
in prison and although i wa still weak and in continu danger of a
relaps i wa oblig to travel nearli a hundr mile to the countri
town where the court wa held mr kirwin charg himself with everi
care of collect wit and arrang my defenc i wa spare
the disgrac of appear publicli as a crimin as the case wa not
brought befor the court that decid on life and death the grand
juri reject the bill on it be prove that i wa on the orknei
island at the hour the bodi of my friend wa found and a fortnight
after my remov i wa liber from prison
my father wa enraptur on find me freed from the vexat of a
crimin charg that i wa again allow to breath the fresh
atmospher and permit to return to my nativ countri i did not
particip in these feel for to me the wall of a dungeon or a
palac were alik hate the cup of life wa poison for ever and
although the sun shone upon me as upon the happi and gai of heart i
saw around me noth but a dens and fright dark penetr by
no light but the glimmer of two ey that glare upon me sometim
thei were the express ey of henri languish in death the dark
orb nearli cover by the lid and the long black lash that fring
them sometim it wa the wateri cloud ey of the monster as i
first saw them in my chamber at ingolstadt
my father tri to awaken in me the feel of affect he talk
of geneva which i should soon visit of elizabeth and ernest but
these word onli drew deep groan from me sometim inde i felt a
wish for happi and thought with melancholi delight of my belov
cousin or long with a devour maladi du pai to see onc more
the blue lake and rapid rhone that had been so dear to me in earli
childhood but my gener state of feel wa a torpor in which a
prison wa as welcom a resid as the divinest scene in natur and
these fit were seldom interrupt but by paroxysm of anguish and
despair at these moment i often endeavour to put an end to the
exist i loath and it requir unceas attend and vigil
to restrain me from commit some dread act of violenc
yet on duti remain to me the recollect of which final
triumph over my selfish despair it wa necessari that i should
return without delai to geneva there to watch over the live of those
i so fondli love and to lie in wait for the murder that if ani
chanc led me to the place of hi conceal or if he dare again to
blast me by hi presenc i might with unfail aim put an end to
the exist of the monstrou imag which i had endu with the
mockeri of a soul still more monstrou my father still desir to
delai our departur fear that i could not sustain the fatigu of a
journei for i wa a shatter wreckth shadow of a human be my
strength wa gone i wa a mere skeleton and fever night and dai
prei upon my wast frame
still as i urg our leav ireland with such inquietud and impati
my father thought it best to yield we took our passag on board a vessel
bound for havredegrac and sail with a fair wind from the irish shore
it wa midnight i lai on the deck look at the star and listen to
the dash of the wave i hail the dark that shut ireland from my
sight and my puls beat with a feverish joi when i reflect that i should
soon see geneva the past appear to me in the light of a fright dream
yet the vessel in which i wa the wind that blew me from the detest
shore of ireland and the sea which surround me told me too forcibl
that i wa deceiv by no vision and that clerval my friend and dearest
companion had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation i
repass in my memori my whole life my quiet happi while resid
with my famili in geneva the death of my mother and my departur for
ingolstadt i rememb shudder the mad enthusiasm that hurri me on
to the creation of my hideou enemi and i call to mind the night in

the voyag came to an end we land and proceed to pari i soon
found that i had overtax my strength and that i must repos befor i
could continu my journei my father care and attent were
indefatig but he did not know the origin of my suffer and
sought erron method to remedi the incur ill he wish me to
seek amus in societi i abhor the face of man oh not
abhor thei were my brethren my fellow be and i felt
attract even to the most repuls among them as to creatur of an
angel natur and celesti mechan but i felt that i had no right
to share their intercours i had unchain an enemi among them whose
joi it wa to shed their blood and to revel in their groan how thei
would each and all abhor me and hunt me from the world did thei know
my unhallow act and the crime which had their sourc in me
my father yield at length to my desir to avoid societi and strove by
variou argument to banish my despair sometim he thought that i
felt deepli the degrad of be oblig to answer a charg of
murder and he endeavour to prove to me the futil of pride
ala my father said i how littl do you know me
human be their feel and passion would inde be degrad if such
a wretch as i felt pride justin poor unhappi justin wa as innoc
as i and she suffer the same charg she di for it and i am the caus
of thisi murder her william justin and henrythei all
di by my hand
my father had often dure my imprison heard me make the same
assert when i thu accus myself he sometim seem to desir an
explan and at other he appear to consid it as the offspr of
delirium and that dure my ill some idea of thi kind had present
itself to my imagin the remembr of which i preserv in my
convalesc i avoid explan and maintain a continu silenc
concern the wretch i had creat i had a persuas that i should be
suppos mad and thi in itself would for ever have chain my tongu but
besid i could not bring myself to disclos a secret which would fill my
hearer with constern and make fear and unnatur horror the inmat of
hi breast i check therefor my impati thirst for sympathi and wa
silent when i would have given the world to have confid the fatal secret
yet still word like those i have record would burst uncontrol
from me i could offer no explan of them but their truth in part
reliev the burden of my mysteri woe
upon thi occas my father said with an express of unbound wonder
my dearest victor what infatu is thi my dear son i entreat
you never to make such an assert again
i am not mad i cri energet the sun and the heaven who
have view my oper can bear wit of my truth i am the
assassin of those most innoc victim thei di by my machin
a thousand time would i have shed my own blood drop by drop to have
save their live but i could not my father inde i could not
sacrific the whole human race
the conclus of thi speech convinc my father that my idea were
derang and he instantli chang the subject of our convers and
endeavour to alter the cours of my thought he wish as much as
possibl to obliter the memori of the scene that had taken place in
ireland and never allud to them or suffer me to speak of my
misfortun
as time pass awai i becam more calm miseri had her dwell in my
heart but i no longer talk in the same incoher manner of my own
crime suffici for me wa the conscious of them by the utmost
selfviol i curb the imperi voic of wretched which

elizabeth lavenza
geneva mai 18th 17
thi letter reviv in my memori what i had befor forgotten the threat of
the fiendi will be with you on your
weddingnight such wa my sentenc and on that night would the
dmon emploi everi art to destroi me and tear me from the glimps of
happi which promis partli to consol my suffer on that night he
had determin to consumm hi crime by my death well be it so a
deadli struggl would then assuredli take place in which if he were
victori i should be at peac and hi power over me be at an end if he
were vanquish i should be a free man ala what freedom such as the
peasant enjoi when hi famili have been massacr befor hi ey hi
cottag burnt hi land laid wast and he is turn adrift homeless
penniless and alon but free such would be my liberti except that in my
elizabeth i possess a treasur ala balanc by those horror of
remors and guilt which would pursu me until death
sweet and belov elizabeth i read and reread her letter and some
soften feel stole into my heart and dare to whisper paradisiac
dream of love and joi but the appl wa alreadi eaten and the
angel arm bare to drive me from all hope yet i would die to make
her happi if the monster execut hi threat death wa inevit yet
again i consid whether my marriag would hasten my fate my
destruct might inde arriv a few month sooner but if my tortur
should suspect that i postpon it influenc by hi menac he would
sure find other and perhap more dread mean of reveng he had vow
to be with me on my weddingnight yet he did not consid that
threat as bind him to peac in the meantim for as if to show me that
he wa not yet satiat with blood he had murder clerval immedi
after the enunci of hi threat i resolv therefor that if my
immedi union with my cousin would conduc either to her or my
father happi my adversari design against my life
should not retard it a singl hour
in thi state of mind i wrote to elizabeth my letter wa calm and
affection i fear my belov girl i said littl happi
remain for us on earth yet all that i mai on dai enjoi is centr in
you chase awai your idl fear to you alon do i consecr my life
and my endeavour for content i have on secret elizabeth a
dread on when reveal to you it will chill your frame with
horror and then far from be surpris at my miseri you will onli
wonder that i surviv what i have endur i will confid thi tale of
miseri and terror to you the dai after our marriag shall take place
for my sweet cousin there must be perfect confid between us but
until then i conjur you do not mention or allud to it thi i most
earnestli entreat and i know you will compli
in about a week after the arriv of elizabeth letter we return
to geneva the sweet girl welcom me with warm affect yet tear were
in her ey as she beheld my emaci frame and feverish cheek i saw a
chang in her also she wa thinner and had lost much of that heavenli
vivac that had befor charm me but her gentl and soft look of
compass made her a more fit companion for on blast and miser as i
wa
the tranquil which i now enjoi did not endur memori brought mad
with it and when i thought of what had pass a real insan possess
me sometim i wa furiou and burnt with rage sometim low and
despond i neither spoke nor look at anyon but sat motionless
bewild by the multitud of miseri that overcam me
elizabeth alon had the power to draw me from these fit her gentl voic
would sooth me when transport by passion and inspir me with human
feel when sunk in torpor she wept with me and for me when reason
return she would remonstr and endeavour to inspir me with
resign ah it is well for the unfortun to be resign but for the
guilti there is no peac the agoni of remors poison the luxuri there is
otherwis sometim found in indulg the excess of grief
soon after my arriv my father spoke of my immedi marriag with
elizabeth i remain silent
have you then some other attach
none on earth i love elizabeth and look forward to our union with
delight let the dai therefor be fix and on it i will consecr
myself in life or death to the happi of my cousin
my dear victor do not speak thu heavi misfortun have befallen
us but let us onli cling closer to what remain and transfer our love
for those whom we have lost to those who yet live our circl will be
small but bound close by the ti of affect and mutual misfortun
and when time shall have soften your despair new and dear object of
care will be born to replac those of whom we have been so cruelli
depriv
such were the lesson of my father but to me the remembr of the
threat return nor can you wonder that omnipot as the fiend had
yet been in hi deed of blood i should almost regard him as
invinc and that when he had pronounc the word i shall be with
you on your weddingnight i should regard the threaten fate as
unavoid but death wa no evil to me if the loss of elizabeth were
balanc with it and i therefor with a content and even cheer
counten agre with my father that if my cousin would consent the
ceremoni should take place in ten dai and thu put as i imagin
the seal to my fate
great god if for on instant i had thought what might be the hellish
intent of my fiendish adversari i would rather have banish myself
for ever from my nativ countri and wander a friendless outcast over
the earth than have consent to thi miser marriag but as if
possess of magic power the monster had blind me to hi real
intent and when i thought that i had prepar onli my own death i
hasten that of a far dearer victim
as the period fix for our marriag drew nearer whether from cowardic or
a prophet feel i felt my heart sink within me but i conceal my
feel by an appear of hilar that brought smile and joi to the
counten of my father but hardli deceiv the everwatch and nicer
ey of elizabeth she look forward to our union with placid content
not unmingl with a littl fear which past misfortun had impress
that what now appear certain and tangibl happi might soon dissip
into an airi dream and leav no trace but deep and everlast regret
prepar were made for the event congratulatori visit were receiv
and all wore a smile appear i shut up as well as i could in my own
heart the anxieti that prei there and enter with seem earnest
into the plan of my father although thei might onli serv as the
decor of my tragedi through my father exert a part of
the inherit of elizabeth had been restor to her by the austrian
govern a small possess on the shore of como belong to her it
wa agre that immedi after our union we should proce to villa
lavenza and spend our first dai of happi besid the beauti lake
near which it stood
in the meantim i took everi precaut to defend my person in case the
fiend should openli attack me i carri pistol and a dagger
constantli about me and wa ever on the watch to prevent artific and
by these mean gain a greater degre of tranquil inde as the
period approach the threat appear more as a delus not to be
regard as worthi to disturb my peac while the happi i hope for
in my marriag wore a greater appear of certainti as the dai fix
for it solemnis drew nearer and i heard it continu spoken of
as an occurr which no accid could possibl prevent
elizabeth seem happi my tranquil demeanour contribut greatli to
calm her mind but on the dai that wa to fulfil my wish and my
destini she wa melancholi and a presenti of evil pervad her
and perhap also she thought of the dread secret which i had
promis to reveal to her on the follow dai my father wa in the
meantim overjoi and in the bustl of prepar onli recognis in
the melancholi of hi niec the diffid of a bride
after the ceremoni wa perform a larg parti assembl at my
father but it wa agre that elizabeth and i should commenc our
journei by water sleep that night at evian and continu our
voyag on the follow dai the dai wa fair the wind favour
all smile on our nuptial embark
those were the last moment of my life dure which i enjoi the
feel of happi we pass rapidli along the sun wa hot but we
were shelter from it rai by a kind of canopi while we enjoi the
beauti of the scene sometim on on side of the lake where we saw
mont salv the pleasant bank of montalgr and at a distanc
surmount all the beauti mont blanc and the assemblag of snowi
mountain that in vain endeavour to emul her sometim coast the
opposit bank we saw the mighti jura oppos it dark side to the
ambit that would quit it nativ countri and an almost
insurmount barrier to the invad who should wish to enslav it
i took the hand of elizabeth you ar sorrow my love ah if
you knew what i have suffer and what i mai yet endur you would
endeavour to let me tast the quiet and freedom from despair that thi
on dai at least permit me to enjoi
be happi my dear victor repli elizabeth there is i hope
noth to distress you and be assur that if a live joi is not
paint in my face my heart is content someth whisper to me
not to depend too much on the prospect that is open befor us but i
will not listen to such a sinist voic observ how fast we move
along and how the cloud which sometim obscur and sometim rise
abov the dome of mont blanc render thi scene of beauti still more
interest look also at the innumer fish that ar swim in
the clear water where we can distinguish everi pebbl that li at
the bottom what a divin dai how happi and seren all natur
appear
thu elizabeth endeavour to divert her thought and mine from all
reflect upon melancholi subject but her temper wa fluctuat
joi for a few instant shone in her ey but it continu gave place
to distract and reveri
the sun sank lower in the heaven we pass the river dranc and
observ it path through the chasm of the higher and the glen of the
lower hill the alp here come closer to the lake and we approach
the amphitheatr of mountain which form it eastern boundari the
spire of evian shone under the wood that surround it and the rang
of mountain abov mountain by which it wa overhung
the wind which had hitherto carri us along with amaz rapid
sank at sunset to a light breez the soft air just ruffl the water
and caus a pleasant motion among the tree as we approach the
shore from which it waft the most delight scent of flower and
hai the sun sank beneath the horizon as we land and as i touch
the shore i felt those care and fear reviv which soon were to clasp
me and cling to me for ever
chapter 23
it wa eight oclock when we land we walk for a short time on the
shore enjoi the transitori light and then retir to the inn and
contempl the love scene of water wood and mountain obscur
in dark yet still displai their black outlin
the wind which had fallen in the south now rose with great violenc
in the west the moon had reach her summit in the heaven and wa
begin to descend the cloud swept across it swifter than the
flight of the vultur and dim her rai while the lake reflect the
scene of the busi heaven render still busier by the restless wave
that were begin to rise suddenli a heavi storm of rain descend
i had been calm dure the dai but so soon as night obscur the
shape of object a thousand fear aros in my mind i wa anxiou
and watch while my right hand grasp a pistol which wa hidden in
my bosom everi sound terrifi me but i resolv that i would sell my
life dearli and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that
of my adversari wa extinguish
elizabeth observ my agit for some time in timid and fear silenc
but there wa someth in my glanc which commun terror to her and
trembl she ask what is it that agit you my dear victor
what is it you fear
oh peac peac my love repli i thi night and
all will be safe but thi night is dread veri dread
i pass an hour in thi state of mind when suddenli i reflect how
fear the combat which i momentarili expect would be to my wife
and i earnestli entreat her to retir resolv not to join her
until i had obtain some knowledg as to the situat of my enemi
she left me and i continu some time walk up and down the passag
of the hous and inspect everi corner that might afford a retreat to
my adversari but i discov no trace of him and wa begin to
conjectur that some fortun chanc had interven to prevent the
execut of hi menac when suddenli i heard a shrill and dread
scream it came from the room into which elizabeth had retir as i
heard it the whole truth rush into my mind my arm drop the
motion of everi muscl and fibr wa suspend i could feel the blood
trickl in my vein and tingl in the extrem of my limb thi
state last but for an instant the scream wa repeat and i rush
into the room
great god why did i not then expir why am i here to relat the
destruct of the best hope and the purest creatur on earth she wa
there lifeless and inanim thrown across the bed her head hang down
and her pale and distort featur half cover by her hair everywher i
turn i see the same figureh bloodless arm and relax form flung
by the murder on it bridal bier could i behold thi and live ala
life is obstin and cling closest where it is most hate for a moment
onli did i lose recollect i fell senseless on the ground
when i recov i found myself surround by the peopl of the inn their
counten express a breathless terror but the horror of other
appear onli as a mockeri a shadow of the feel that oppress me i
escap from them to the room where lai the bodi of elizabeth my love my
wife so late live so dear so worthi she had been move from the
postur in which i had first beheld her and now as she lai her head upon
her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck i might have
suppos her asleep i rush toward her and embrac her with ardour but
the deadli languor and cold of the limb told me that what i now held
in my arm had ceas to be the elizabeth whom i had love and cherish
the murder mark of the fiend grasp wa on her neck and the
breath had ceas to issu from her lip
while i still hung over her in the agoni of despair i happen to look up
the window of the room had befor been darken and i felt a kind of
panic on see the pale yellow light of the moon illumin the chamber
the shutter had been thrown back and with a sensat of horror not to be
describ i saw at the open window a figur the most hideou and abhor
a grin wa on the face of the monster he seem to jeer as with hi
fiendish finger he point toward the corps of my wife i rush toward
the window and draw a pistol from my bosom fire but he elud me
leap from hi station and run with the swift of lightn
plung into the lake
the report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room i point to
the spot where he had disappear and we follow the track with
boat net were cast but in vain after pass sever hour we
return hopeless most of my companion believ it to have been a
form conjur up by my fanci after have land thei proceed to
search the countri parti go in differ direct among the
wood and vine
i attempt to accompani them and proceed a short distanc from the
hous but my head whirl round my step were like those of a drunken
man i fell at last in a state of utter exhaust a film cover my
ey and my skin wa parch with the heat of fever in thi state i
wa carri back and place on a bed hardli consciou of what had
happen my ey wander round the room as if to seek someth that
i had lost
after an interv i aros and as if by instinct crawl into the room
where the corps of my belov lai there were women weep around i
hung over it and join my sad tear to their all thi time no
distinct idea present itself to my mind but my thought rambl to
variou subject reflect confusedli on my misfortun and their
caus i wa bewild in a cloud of wonder and horror the death
of william the execut of justin the murder of clerval and lastli
of my wife even at that moment i knew not that my onli remain
friend were safe from the malign of the fiend my father even now
might be writh under hi grasp and ernest might be dead at hi
feet thi idea made me shudder and recal me to action i start
up and resolv to return to geneva with all possibl speed
there were no hors to be procur and i must return by the lake but the
wind wa unfavour and the rain fell in torrent howev it wa
hardli morn and i might reason hope to arriv by night i hire men
to row and took an oar myself for i had alwai experienc relief from
mental torment in bodili exercis but the overflow miseri i now felt
and the excess of agit that i endur render me incap of ani
exert i threw down the oar and lean my head upon my hand gave wai
to everi gloomi idea that aros if i look up i saw scene which were
familiar to me in my happier time and which i had contempl but the dai
befor in the compani of her who wa now but a shadow and a recollect
tear stream from my ey the rain had ceas for a moment and i saw
the fish plai in the water as thei had done a few hour befor thei had
then been observ by elizabeth noth is so pain to the human mind as
a great and sudden chang the sun might shine or the cloud might lower
but noth could appear to me as it had done the dai befor a fiend had
snatch from me everi hope of futur happi no creatur had ever been
so miser as i wa so fright an event is singl in the histori of
man
but why should i dwell upon the incid that follow thi last
overwhelm event mine ha been a tale of horror i have reach their
acm and what i must now relat can but be tediou to you know
that on by on my friend were snatch awai i wa left desol my
own strength is exhaust and i must tell in a few word what remain of
my hideou narrat
i arriv at geneva my father and ernest yet live but the former sunk
under the tide that i bore i see him now excel and vener old
man hi ey wander in vacanc for thei had lost their charm and their
delighthi elizabeth hi more than daughter whom he dote on with
all that affect which a man feel who in the declin of life have
few affect cling more earnestli to those that remain curs curs
be the fiend that brought miseri on hi grei hair and doom him to wast
in wretched he could not live under the horror that were accumul
around him the spring of exist suddenli gave wai he wa unabl to
rise from hi bed and in a few dai he di in my arm
what then becam of me i know not i lost sensat and chain and
dark were the onli object that press upon me sometim
inde i dreamt that i wander in floweri meadow and pleasant vale
with the friend of my youth but i awok and found myself in a
dungeon melancholi follow but by degre i gain a clear
concept of my miseri and situat and wa then releas from my
prison for thei had call me mad and dure mani month as i
understood a solitari cell had been my habit
liberti howev had been a useless gift to me had i not as i
awaken to reason at the same time awaken to reveng as the
memori of past misfortun press upon me i began to reflect on their
causeth monster whom i had creat the miser dmon whom i had
sent abroad into the world for my destruct i wa possess by a
madden rage when i thought of him and desir and ardent prai
that i might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal
reveng on hi curs head
nor did my hate long confin itself to useless wish i began to
reflect on the best mean of secur him and for thi purpos about
a month after my releas i repair to a crimin judg in the town
and told him that i had an accus to make that i knew the
destroy of my famili and that i requir him to exert hi whole
author for the apprehens of the murder
the magistr listen to me with attent and kind be
assur sir said he no pain or exert on my part shall
be spare to discov the villain
i thank you repli i listen therefor to the
deposit that i have to make it is inde a tale so strang that i
should fear you would not credit it were there not someth in truth
which howev wonder forc convict the stori is too connect to
be mistaken for a dream and i have no motiv for falsehood my
manner as i thu address him wa impress but calm i had form in my
own heart a resolut to pursu my destroy to death and thi purpos
quiet my agoni and for an interv reconcil me to life i now relat
my histori briefli but with firm and precis mark the date with
accuraci and never deviat into invect or exclam
the magistr appear at first perfectli incredul but as i continu
he becam more attent and interest i saw him sometim shudder with
horror at other a live surpris unmingl with disbelief wa paint
on hi counten
when i had conclud my narrat i said thi is the be whom i
accus and for whose seizur and punish i call upon you to exert your
whole power it is your duti as a magistr and i believ and hope that
your feel as a man will not revolt from the execut of those
function on thi occas
thi address caus a consider chang in the physiognomi of my own
auditor he had heard my stori with that half kind of belief that is given
to a tale of spirit and supernatur event but when he wa call upon
to act offici in consequ the whole tide of hi incredul
return he howev answer mildli i would willingli afford you
everi aid in your pursuit but the creatur of whom you speak appear to
have power which would put all my exert to defianc who can follow an
anim which can travers the sea of ic and inhabit cave and den where
no man would ventur to intrud besid some month have elaps sinc
the commiss of hi crime and no on can conjectur to what place he
ha wander or what region he mai now inhabit
i do not doubt that he hover near the spot which i inhabit and if
he ha inde taken refug in the alp he mai be hunt like the chamoi
and destroi as a beast of prei but i perceiv your thought you do not
credit my narr and do not intend to pursu my enemi with the
punish which is hi desert
as i spoke rage sparkl in my ey the magistr wa intimid
you ar mistaken said he i will exert myself and if
it is in my power to seiz the monster be assur that he shall suffer
punish proportion to hi crime but i fear from what you have
yourself describ to be hi properti that thi will prove
impractic and thu while everi proper measur is pursu you should
make up your mind to disappoint
that cannot be but all that i can sai will be of littl avail my
reveng is of no moment to you yet while i allow it to be a vice i
confess that it is the devour and onli passion of my soul my rage
is unspeak when i reflect that the murder whom i have turn
loos upon societi still exist you refus my just demand i have
but on resourc and i devot myself either in my life or death to
hi destruct
i trembl with excess of agit as i said thi there wa a frenzi
in my manner and someth i doubt not of that haughti fierc
which the martyr of old ar said to have possess but to a genevan
magistr whose mind wa occupi by far other idea than those of
devot and heroism thi elev of mind had much the appear of
mad he endeavour to sooth me as a nurs doe a child and
revert to my tale as the effect of delirium
man i cri how ignor art thou in thy pride of
wisdom ceas you know not what it is you sai
i broke from the hous angri and disturb and retir to medit on
some other mode of action
chapter 24
my present situat wa on in which all voluntari thought wa
swallow up and lost i wa hurri awai by furi reveng alon
endow me with strength and composur it mould my feel and
allow me to be calcul and calm at period when otherwis
delirium or death would have been my portion
my first resolut wa to quit geneva for ever my countri which when i
wa happi and belov wa dear to me now in my advers becam
hate i provid myself with a sum of monei togeth with a few jewel
which had belong to my mother and depart
and now my wander began which ar to ceas but with life i have
travers a vast portion of the earth and have endur all the hardship
which travel in desert and barbar countri ar wont to meet how i
have live i hardli know mani time have i stretch my fail limb upon
the sandi plain and prai for death but reveng kept me aliv i dare
not die and leav my adversari in be
when i quit geneva my first labour wa to gain some clue by which i
might trace the step of my fiendish enemi but my plan wa unsettl
and i wander mani hour round the confin of the town uncertain
what path i should pursu as night approach i found myself at the
entranc of the cemeteri where william elizabeth and my father
repos i enter it and approach the tomb which mark their
grave everyth wa silent except the leav of the tree which
were gentli agit by the wind the night wa nearli dark and the
scene would have been solemn and affect even to an uninterest
observ the spirit of the depart seem to flit around and to
cast a shadow which wa felt but not seen around the head of the
mourner
the deep grief which thi scene had at first excit quickli gave wai to
rage and despair thei were dead and i live their murder also live
and to destroi him i must drag out my weari exist i knelt on the grass
and kiss the earth and with quiver lip exclaim by the
sacr earth on which i kneel by the shade that wander near me by the
deep and etern grief that i feel i swear and by thee o night and the
spirit that presid over thee to pursu the dmon who caus thi miseri
until he or i shall perish in mortal conflict for thi purpos i will
preserv my life to execut thi dear reveng will i again behold the sun
and tread the green herbag of earth which otherwis should vanish from my
ey for ever and i call on you spirit of the dead and on you wander
minist of vengeanc to aid and conduct me in my work let the curs
and hellish monster drink deep of agoni let him feel the despair that now
torment me
i had begun my adjur with solemn and an aw which almost assur me
that the shade of my murder friend heard and approv my devot but
the furi possess me as i conclud and rage choke my utter
i wa answer through the still of night by a loud and fiendish
laugh it rang on my ear long and heavili the mountain reecho
it and i felt as if all hell surround me with mockeri and laughter
sure in that moment i should have been possess by frenzi and have
destroi my miser exist but that my vow wa heard and that i
wa reserv for vengeanc the laughter di awai when a wellknown
and abhor voic appar close to my ear address me in an
audibl whisper i am satisfi miser wretch you have
determin to live and i am satisfi
i dart toward the spot from which the sound proceed but the devil
elud my grasp suddenli the broad disk of the moon aros and shone
full upon hi ghastli and distort shape as he fled with more than
mortal speed
i pursu him and for mani month thi ha been my task guid by a
slight clue i follow the wind of the rhone but vainli the
blue mediterranean appear and by a strang chanc i saw the fiend
enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the black sea i
took my passag in the same ship but he escap i know not how
amidst the wild of tartari and russia although he still evad me i
have ever follow in hi track sometim the peasant scare by
thi horrid apparit inform me of hi path sometim he himself
who fear that if i lost all trace of him i should despair and die
left some mark to guid me the snow descend on my head and i saw
the print of hi huge step on the white plain to you first enter
on life to whom care is new and agoni unknown how can you understand
what i have felt and still feel cold want and fatigu were the
least pain which i wa destin to endur i wa curs by some devil
and carri about with me my etern hell yet still a spirit of good
follow and direct my step and when i most murmur would suddenli
extric me from seemingli insurmount difficulti sometim
when natur overcom by hunger sank under the exhaust a repast
wa prepar for me in the desert that restor and inspirit me the
fare wa inde coars such as the peasant of the countri at but
i will not doubt that it wa set there by the spirit that i had
invok to aid me often when all wa dry the heaven cloudless and
i wa parch by thirst a slight cloud would bedim the sky shed the
few drop that reviv me and vanish
i follow when i could the cours of the river but the dmon
gener avoid these as it wa here that the popul of the
countri chiefli collect in other place human be were seldom
seen and i gener subsist on the wild anim that cross my
path i had monei with me and gain the friendship of the villag
by distribut it or i brought with me some food that i had kill
which after take a small part i alwai present to those who had
provid me with fire and utensil for cook
my life as it pass thu wa inde hate to me and it wa dure
sleep alon that i could tast joi o bless sleep often when most
miser i sank to repos and my dream lull me even to raptur the
spirit that guard me had provid these moment or rather hour of
happi that i might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimag depriv of
thi respit i should have sunk under my hardship dure the dai i wa
sustain and inspirit by the hope of night for in sleep i saw my
friend my wife and my belov countri again i saw the benevol
counten of my father heard the silver tone of my elizabeth
voic and beheld clerval enjoi health and youth often when weari by
a toilsom march i persuad myself that i wa dream until night should
come and that i should then enjoi realiti in the arm of my dearest
friend what agonis fond did i feel for them how did i cling to
their dear form as sometim thei haunt even my wake hour and
persuad myself that thei still live at such moment vengeanc that
burn within me di in my heart and i pursu my path toward the
destruct of the dmon more as a task enjoin by heaven as the
mechan impuls of some power of which i wa unconsci than as the
ardent desir of my soul
what hi feel were whom i pursu i cannot know sometim inde he
left mark in write on the bark of the tree or cut in stone that guid
me and instig my furi my reign is not yet
overthes word were legibl in on of these
inscriptionsy live and my power is complet follow me i
seek the everlast ic of the north where you will feel the miseri of
cold and frost to which i am impass you will find near thi place if
you follow not too tardili a dead hare eat and be refresh come on my
enemi we have yet to wrestl for our live but mani hard and miser
hour must you endur until that period shall arriv
scof devil again do i vow vengeanc again do i devot thee
miser fiend to tortur and death never will i give up my search
until he or i perish and then with what ecstasi shall i join my
elizabeth and my depart friend who even now prepar for me the
reward of my tediou toil and horribl pilgrimag
as i still pursu my journei to the northward the snow thicken and the
cold increas in a degre almost too sever to support the peasant were
shut up in their hovel and onli a few of the most hardi ventur forth to
seiz the anim whom starvat had forc from their hidingplac to
seek for prei the river were cover with ic and no fish could be
procur and thu i wa cut off from my chief articl of mainten

inscript that he left wa in these word prepar your toil
onli begin wrap yourself in fur and provid food for we shall soon enter
upon a journei where your suffer will satisfi my everlast
hatr
my courag and persever were invigor by these scof word i
resolv not to fail in my purpos and call on heaven to support
me i continu with unab fervour to travers immens desert
until the ocean appear at a distanc and form the utmost boundari
of the horizon oh how unlik it wa to the blue season of the
south cover with ic it wa onli to be distinguish from land by
it superior wild and rugged the greek wept for joi when
thei beheld the mediterranean from the hill of asia and hail with
raptur the boundari of their toil i did not weep but i knelt down
and with a full heart thank my guid spirit for conduct me in
safeti to the place where i hope notwithstand my adversari gibe
to meet and grappl with him
some week befor thi period i had procur a sledg and dog and thu
travers the snow with inconceiv speed i know not whether the
fiend possess the same advantag but i found that as befor i had
daili lost ground in the pursuit i now gain on him so much so that
when i first saw the ocean he wa but on dai journei in advanc and
i hope to intercept him befor he should reach the beach with new
courag therefor i press on and in two dai arriv at a wretch
hamlet on the seashor i inquir of the inhabit concern the
fiend and gain accur inform a gigant monster thei said
had arriv the night befor arm with a gun and mani pistol
put to flight the inhabit of a solitari cottag through fear of
hi terrif appear he had carri off their store of winter
food and place it in a sledg to draw which he had seiz on a
numer drove of train dog he had har them and the same
night to the joi of the horrorstruck villag had pursu hi
journei across the sea in a direct that led to no land and thei
conjectur that he must speedili be destroi by the break of the
ic or frozen by the etern frost
on hear thi inform i suffer a temporari access of despair
he had escap me and i must commenc a destruct and almost endless
journei across the mountain ic of the ocean amidst cold that few
of the inhabit could long endur and which i the nativ of a
genial and sunni climat could not hope to surviv yet at the idea
that the fiend should live and be triumphant my rage and vengeanc
return and like a mighti tide overwhelm everi other feel
after a slight repos dure which the spirit of the dead hover
round and instig me to toil and reveng i prepar for my journei
i exchang my landsledg for on fashion for the inequ of
the frozen ocean and purchas a plenti stock of provis i
depart from land
i cannot guess how mani dai have pass sinc then but i have endur
miseri which noth but the etern sentiment of a just retribut
burn within my heart could have enabl me to support immens and
rug mountain of ic often bar up my passag and i often heard
the thunder of the ground sea which threaten my destruct but
again the frost came and made the path of the sea secur
by the quantiti of provis which i had consum i should guess that
i had pass three week in thi journei and the continu protract
of hope return back upon the heart often wrung bitter drop of
despond and grief from my ey despair had inde almost secur
her prei and i should soon have sunk beneath thi miseri onc after
the poor anim that convei me had with incred toil gain the
summit of a slope ic mountain and on sink under hi fatigu
di i view the expans befor me with anguish when suddenli my ey
caught a dark speck upon the duski plain i strain my sight to
discov what it could be and utter a wild cry of ecstasi when i
distinguish a sledg and the distort proport of a wellknown
form within oh with what a burn gush did hope revisit my heart
warm tear fill my ey which i hastili wipe awai that thei might
not intercept the view i had of the dmon but still my sight wa
dim by the burn drop until give wai to the emot that
oppress me i wept aloud
but thi wa not the time for delai i disencumb the dog of their
dead companion gave them a plenti portion of food and after an
hour rest which wa absolut necessari and yet which wa bitterli
irksom to me i continu my rout the sledg wa still visibl nor
did i again lose sight of it except at the moment when for a short
time some icerock conceal it with it interven crag i inde
percept gain on it and when after nearli two dai journei i
beheld my enemi at no more than a mile distant my heart bound within
me
but now when i appear almost within grasp of my foe my hope were
suddenli extinguish and i lost all trace of him more utterli than i had
ever done befor a ground sea wa heard the thunder of it progress as
the water roll and swell beneath me becam everi moment more omin
and terrif i press on but in vain the wind aros the sea roar
and as with the mighti shock of an earthquak it split and crack with a
tremend and overwhelm sound the work wa soon finish in a few
minut a tumultu sea roll between me and my enemi and i wa left
drift on a scatter piec of ic that wa continu lessen and
thu prepar for me a hideou death
in thi manner mani appal hour pass sever of my dog di and i
myself wa about to sink under the accumul of distress when i saw your
vessel ride at anchor and hold forth to me hope of succour and life
i had no concept that vessel ever came so far north and wa astound
at the sight i quickli destroi part of my sledg to construct oar and
by these mean wa enabl with infinit fatigu to move my ic raft in

you have read thi strang and terrif stori margaret and do you not
feel your blood congeal with horror like that which even now curdl
mine sometim seiz with sudden agoni he could not continu hi
tale at other hi voic broken yet pierc utter with
difficulti the word so replet with anguish hi fine and love ey
were now light up with indign now subdu to downcast sorrow
and quench in infinit wretched sometim he command hi
counten and tone and relat the most horribl incid with a
tranquil voic suppress everi mark of agit then like a
volcano burst forth hi face would suddenli chang to an express
of the wildest rage as he shriek out imprec on hi persecutor
hi tale is connect and told with an appear of the simplest truth
yet i own to you that the letter of felix and safi which he show me
and the apparit of the monster seen from our ship brought to me a
greater convict of the truth of hi narr than hi assever
howev earnest and connect such a monster ha then realli exist
i cannot doubt it yet i am lost in surpris and admir sometim i
endeavour to gain from frankenstein the particular of hi
creatur format but on thi point he wa impenetr
ar you mad my friend said he or whither doe your
senseless curios lead you would you also creat for yourself and the
world a demoniac enemi peac peac learn my miseri and do not seek
to increas your own
frankenstein discov that i made note concern hi histori he ask
to see them and then himself correct and augment them in mani place
but princip in give the life and spirit to the convers he held
with hi enemi sinc you have preserv my narrat said
he i would not that a mutil on should go down to
poster
thu ha a week pass awai while i have listen to the strangest
tale that ever imagin form my thought and everi feel of my
soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which thi tale
and hi own elev and gentl manner have creat i wish to sooth
him yet can i counsel on so infinit miser so destitut of
everi hope of consol to live oh no the onli joi that he can
now know will be when he compos hi shatter spirit to peac and
death yet he enjoi on comfort the offspr of solitud and
delirium he believ that when in dream he hold convers with hi
friend and deriv from that communion consol for hi miseri or
excit to hi vengeanc that thei ar not the creation of hi
fanci but the be themselv who visit him from the region of a
remot world thi faith give a solemn to hi reveri that render
them to me almost as impos and interest as truth
our convers ar not alwai confin to hi own histori and
misfortun on everi point of gener literatur he displai
unbound knowledg and a quick and pierc apprehens hi
eloqu is forcibl and touch nor can i hear him when he relat
a pathet incid or endeavour to move the passion of piti or love
without tear what a gloriou creatur must he have been in the dai
of hi prosper when he is thu nobl and godlik in ruin he seem
to feel hi own worth and the great of hi fall
when younger said he i believ myself destin for
some great enterpris my feel ar profound but i possess a cool
of judgment that fit me for illustri achiev thi sentiment of
the worth of my natur support me when other would have been oppress
for i deem it crimin to throw awai in useless grief those talent that
might be us to my fellow creatur when i reflect on the work i had
complet no less a on than the creation of a sensit and ration
anim i could not rank myself with the herd of common projector but
thi thought which support me in the commenc of my career now
serv onli to plung me lower in the dust all my specul and hope
ar as noth and like the archangel who aspir to omnipot i am
chain in an etern hell my imagin wa vivid yet my power of
analysi and applic were intens by the union of these qualiti i
conceiv the idea and execut the creation of a man even now i cannot
recollect without passion my reveri while the work wa incomplet i trod
heaven in my thought now exult in my power now burn with the idea
of their effect from my infanc i wa imbu with high hope and a lofti
ambit but how am i sunk oh my friend if you had known me as i onc
wa you would not recognis me in thi state of degrad despond
rare visit my heart a high destini seem to bear me on until i fell
never never again to rise
must i then lose thi admir be i have long for a friend i have
sought on who would sympathis with and love me behold on these desert
sea i have found such a on but i fear i have gain him onli to know hi
valu and lose him i would reconcil him to life but he repuls the idea
i thank you walton he said for your kind intent toward so
miser a wretch but when you speak of new ti and fresh
affect think you that ani can replac those who ar gone can ani
man be to me as clerval wa or ani woman anoth elizabeth even
where the affect ar not strongli move by ani superior excel
the companion of our childhood alwai possess a certain power over our
mind which hardli ani later friend can obtain thei know our
infantin disposit which howev thei mai be afterward modifi
ar never erad and thei can judg of our action with more
certain conclus as to the integr of our motiv a sister or a
brother can never unless inde such symptom have been shown earli
suspect the other of fraud or fals deal when anoth friend
howev strongli he mai be attach mai in spite of himself be
contempl with suspicion but i enjoi friend dear not onli
through habit and associ but from their own merit and wherev
i am the sooth voic of my elizabeth and the convers of
clerval will be ever whisper in my ear thei ar dead and but on
feel in such a solitud can persuad me to preserv my life if i
were engag in ani high undertak or design fraught with extens
util to my fellow creatur then could i live to fulfil it but
such is not my destini i must pursu and destroi the be to whom i
gave exist then my lot on earth will be fulfil and i mai die
my belov sister
septemb 2d
i write to you encompass by peril and ignor whether i am ever
doom to see again dear england and the dearer friend that inhabit
it i am surround by mountain of ic which admit of no escap and
threaten everi moment to crush my vessel the brave fellow whom i
have persuad to be my companion look toward me for aid but i have
none to bestow there is someth terribl appal in our
situat yet my courag and hope do not desert me yet it is
terribl to reflect that the live of all these men ar endang
through me if we ar lost my mad scheme ar the caus
and what margaret will be the state of your mind you will not hear of my
destruct and you will anxious await my return year will pass and
you will have visit of despair and yet be tortur by hope oh my
belov sister the sicken fail of your heartfelt expect is
in prospect more terribl to me than my own death but you have a husband
and love children you mai be happi heaven bless you and make you so
my unfortun guest regard me with the tenderest compass he
endeavour to fill me with hope and talk as if life were a possess
which he valu he remind me how often the same accid have
happen to other navig who have attempt thi sea and in spite
of myself he fill me with cheer auguri even the sailor feel
the power of hi eloqu when he speak thei no longer despair he
rous their energi and while thei hear hi voic thei believ these
vast mountain of ic ar molehil which will vanish befor the
resolut of man these feel ar transitori each dai of
expect delai fill them with fear and i almost dread a mutini
caus by thi despair
septemb 5th
a scene ha just pass of such uncommon interest that although it is
highli probabl that these paper mai never reach you yet i cannot
forbear record it
we ar still surround by mountain of ic still in immin danger
of be crush in their conflict the cold is excess and mani of
my unfortun comrad have alreadi found a grave amidst thi scene of
desol frankenstein ha daili declin in health a feverish fire
still glimmer in hi ey but he is exhaust and when suddenli
rous to ani exert he speedili sink again into appar
lifeless
i mention in my last letter the fear i entertain of a mutini
thi morn as i sat watch the wan counten of my friendhi
ey half close and hi limb hang listlesslyi wa rous by half
a dozen of the sailor who demand admiss into the cabin thei
enter and their leader address me he told me that he and hi
companion had been chosen by the other sailor to come in deput
to me to make me a requisit which in justic i could not refus
we were immur in ic and should probabl never escap but thei
fear that if as wa possibl the ic should dissip and a free
passag be open i should be rash enough to continu my voyag and
lead them into fresh danger after thei might happili have surmount
thi thei insist therefor that i should engag with a solemn
promis that if the vessel should be freed i would instantli direct my
cours southward
thi speech troubl me i had not despair nor had i yet conceiv
the idea of return if set free yet could i in justic or even in
possibl refus thi demand i hesit befor i answer when
frankenstein who had at first been silent and inde appear hardli
to have forc enough to attend now rous himself hi ey sparkl
and hi cheek flush with momentari vigour turn toward the men
he said
what do you mean what do you demand of your captain ar you then
so easili turn from your design did you not call thi a gloriou
expedit and wherefor wa it gloriou not becaus the wai wa
smooth and placid as a southern sea but becaus it wa full of danger and
terror becaus at everi new incid your fortitud wa to be call forth
and your courag exhibit becaus danger and death surround it and
these you were to brave and overcom for thi wa it a gloriou for thi
wa it an honour undertak you were hereaft to be hail as the
benefactor of your speci your name ador as belong to brave men
who encount death for honour and the benefit of mankind and now
behold with the first imagin of danger or if you will the first
mighti and terrif trial of your courag you shrink awai and ar content
to be hand down as men who had not strength enough to endur cold and
peril and so poor soul thei were chilli and return to their warm
firesid why that requir not thi prepar ye need not have come
thu far and drag your captain to the shame of a defeat mere to prove
yourselv coward oh be men or be more than men be steadi to your
purpos and firm as a rock thi ic is not made of such stuff as your
heart mai be it is mutabl and cannot withstand you if you sai that it
shall not do not return to your famili with the stigma of disgrac
mark on your brow return as hero who have fought and conquer and
who know not what it is to turn their back on the foe
he spoke thi with a voic so modul to the differ feel express
in hi speech with an ey so full of lofti design and heroism that can
you wonder that these men were move thei look at on anoth and were
unabl to repli i spoke i told them to retir and consid of what had
been said that i would not lead them farther north if thei strenuous
desir the contrari but that i hope that with reflect their courag
would return
thei retir and i turn toward my friend but he wa sunk in languor and
almost depriv of life
how all thi will termin i know not but i had rather die than
return shamefulli my purpos unfulfil yet i fear such will be my
fate the men unsupport by idea of glori and honour can never
willingli continu to endur their present hardship
septemb 7th
the die is cast i have consent to return if we ar not destroi
thu ar my hope blast by cowardic and indecis i come back
ignor and disappoint it requir more philosophi than i possess
to bear thi injustic with patienc
septemb 12th
it is past i am return to england i have lost my hope of util
and glori i have lost my friend but i will endeavour to detail these
bitter circumst to you my dear sister and while i am waft
toward england and toward you i will not despond
septemb 9th the ic began to move and roar like thunder were heard
at a distanc as the island split and crack in everi direct we were
in the most immin peril but as we could onli remain passiv my chief
attent wa occupi by my unfortun guest whose ill increas in
such a degre that he wa entir confin to hi bed the ic crack
behind us and wa driven with forc toward the north a breez sprang from
the west and on the 11th the passag toward the south becam perfectli
free when the sailor saw thi and that their return to their nativ
countri wa appar assur a shout of tumultu joi broke from them
loud and longcontinu frankenstein who wa doze awok and ask the
caus of the tumult thei shout i said becaus thei
will soon return to england
do you then realli return
ala ye i cannot withstand their demand i cannot lead them
unwillingli to danger and i must return
do so if you will but i will not you mai give up your purpos but
mine is assign to me by heaven and i dare not i am weak but
sure the spirit who assist my vengeanc will endow me with
suffici strength sai thi he endeavour to spring from the
bed but the exert wa too great for him he fell back and faint
it wa long befor he wa restor and i often thought that life wa
entir extinct at length he open hi ey he breath with
difficulti and wa unabl to speak the surgeon gave him a compos
draught and order us to leav him undisturb in the meantim he
told me that my friend had certainli not mani hour to live
hi sentenc wa pronounc and i could onli griev and be patient i sat
by hi bed watch him hi ey were close and i thought he slept but
present he call to me in a feebl voic and bid me come near
said ala the strength i reli on is gone i feel that i shall
soon die and he my enemi and persecutor mai still be in be think
not walton that in the last moment of my exist i feel that burn
hatr and ardent desir of reveng i onc express but i feel myself
justifi in desir the death of my adversari dure these last dai i
have been occupi in examin my past conduct nor do i find it blamabl
in a fit of enthusiast mad i creat a ration creatur and wa
bound toward him to assur as far as wa in my power hi happi and
wellb thi wa my duti but there wa anoth still paramount to
that my duti toward the be of my own speci had greater claim to
my attent becaus thei includ a greater proport of happi or
miseri urg by thi view i refus and i did right in refus to
creat a companion for the first creatur he show unparallel malign
and selfish in evil he destroi my friend he devot to destruct
be who possess exquisit sensat happi and wisdom nor do i
know where thi thirst for vengeanc mai end miser himself that he mai
render no other wretch he ought to die the task of hi destruct wa
mine but i have fail when actuat by selfish and viciou motiv i
ask you to undertak my unfinish work and i renew thi request now
when i am onli induc by reason and virtu
yet i cannot ask you to renounc your countri and friend to fulfil
thi task and now that you ar return to england you will have
littl chanc of meet with him but the consider of these
point and the well balanc of what you mai esteem your duti i
leav to you my judgment and idea ar alreadi disturb by the near
approach of death i dare not ask you to do what i think right for i
mai still be misl by passion
that he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturb me in
other respect thi hour when i momentarili expect my releas is the
onli happi on which i have enjoi for sever year the form of
the belov dead flit befor me and i hasten to their arm farewel
walton seek happi in tranquil and avoid ambit even if it
be onli the appar innoc on of distinguish yourself in
scienc and discoveri yet why do i sai thi i have myself been
blast in these hope yet anoth mai succe
hi voic becam fainter as he spoke and at length exhaust by hi
effort he sank into silenc about half an hour afterward he
attempt again to speak but wa unabl he press my hand feebli and
hi ey close for ever while the irradi of a gentl smile pass
awai from hi lip
margaret what comment can i make on the untim extinct of thi
gloriou spirit what can i sai that will enabl you to understand the
depth of my sorrow all that i should express would be inadequ and
feebl my tear flow my mind is overshadow by a cloud of
disappoint but i journei toward england and i mai there find
consol
i am interrupt what do these sound portend it is midnight the
breez blow fairli and the watch on deck scarc stir again there
is a sound as of a human voic but hoarser it come from the cabin
where the remain of frankenstein still lie i must aris and examin
good night my sister
great god what a scene ha just taken place i am yet dizzi with the
remembr of it i hardli know whether i shall have the power to detail
it yet the tale which i have record would be incomplet without thi
final and wonder catastroph
i enter the cabin where lai the remain of my illfat and admir
friend over him hung a form which i cannot find word to
describegigant in statur yet uncouth and distort in it
proport as he hung over the coffin hi face wa conceal by long
lock of rag hair but on vast hand wa extend in colour and
appar textur like that of a mummi when he heard the sound of my
approach he ceas to utter exclam of grief and horror and sprung
toward the window never did i behold a vision so horribl as hi face of
such loathsom yet appal hideous i shut my ey involuntarili and
endeavour to recollect what were my duti with regard to thi destroy
i call on him to stai
he paus look on me with wonder and again turn toward the
lifeless form of hi creator he seem to forget my presenc and
everi featur and gestur seem instig by the wildest rage of some
uncontrol passion
that is also my victim he exclaim in hi murder my
crime ar consumm the miser seri of my be is wound to it
close oh frankenstein gener and selfdevot be what doe it
avail that i now ask thee to pardon me i who irretriev destroi thee
by destroi all thou lovedst ala he is cold he cannot answer
me
hi voic seem suffoc and my first impuls which had suggest to
me the duti of obei the dy request of my friend in destroi hi
enemi were now suspend by a mixtur of curios and compass i
approach thi tremend be i dare not again rais my ey to hi
face there wa someth so scare and unearthli in hi ugli i
attempt to speak but the word di awai on my lip the monster
continu to utter wild and incoher selfreproach at length i
gather resolut to address him in a paus of the tempest of hi passion
your repent i said is now superflu if you
had listen to the voic of conscienc and heed the sting of remors
befor you had urg your diabol vengeanc to thi extrem
frankenstein would yet have live
and do you dream said the dmon do you think that i wa then
dead to agoni and remors he he continu point to the corps
he suffer not in the consumm of the deed oh not the
tenthousandth portion of the anguish that wa mine dure the
linger detail of it execut a fright selfish hurri me
on while my heart wa poison with remors think you that the
groan of clerval were music to my ear my heart wa fashion to be
suscept of love and sympathi and when wrench by miseri to vice
and hatr it did not endur the violenc of the chang without
tortur such as you cannot even imagin
after the murder of clerval i return to switzerland heartbroken
and overcom i piti frankenstein my piti amount to horror i
abhor myself but when i discov that he the author at onc of
my exist and of it unspeak torment dare to hope for
happi that while he accumul wretched and despair upon me
he sought hi own enjoy in feel and passion from the
indulg of which i wa for ever bar then impot envi and bitter
indign fill me with an insati thirst for vengeanc i
recollect my threat and resolv that it should be accomplish i
knew that i wa prepar for myself a deadli tortur but i wa the
slave not the master of an impuls which i detest yet could not
disobei yet when she di nai then i wa not miser i had
cast off all feel subdu all anguish to riot in the excess of my
despair evil thenceforth becam my good urg thu far i had no
choic but to adapt my natur to an element which i had willingli
chosen the complet of my demoniac design becam an insati
passion and now it is end there is my last victim
i wa at first touch by the express of hi miseri yet when i call
to mind what frankenstein had said of hi power of eloqu and
persuas and when i again cast my ey on the lifeless form of my
friend indign wa rekindl within me wretch i said
it is well that you come here to whine over the desol that you
have made you throw a torch into a pile of build and when thei ar
consum you sit among the ruin and lament the fall hypocrit fiend
if he whom you mourn still live still would he be the object again would
he becom the prei of your accurs vengeanc it is not piti that you
feel you lament onli becaus the victim of your malign is withdrawn
from your power
oh it is not thusnot thu interrupt the be
yet such must be the impress convei to you by what appear to
be the purport of my action yet i seek not a fellow feel in my miseri
no sympathi mai i ever find when i first sought it it wa the love of
virtu the feel of happi and affect with which my whole be
overflow that i wish to be particip but now that virtu ha
becom to me a shadow and that happi and affect ar turn into
bitter and loath despair in what should i seek for sympathi i am
content to suffer alon while my suffer shall endur when i die i am
well satisfi that abhorr and opprobrium should load my memori onc
my fanci wa sooth with dream of virtu of fame and of enjoy onc
i fals hope to meet with be who pardon my outward form would
love me for the excel qualiti which i wa capabl of unfold i wa
nourish with high thought of honour and devot but now crime ha
degrad me beneath the meanest anim no guilt no mischief no
malign no miseri can be found compar to mine when i run over the
fright catalogu of my sin i cannot believ that i am the same
creatur whose thought were onc fill with sublim and transcend
vision of the beauti and the majesti of good but it is even so the
fallen angel becom a malign devil yet even that enemi of god and man
had friend and associ in hi desol i am alon
you who call frankenstein your friend seem to have a knowledg of my
crime and hi misfortun but in the detail which he gave you of them
he could not sum up the hour and month of miseri which i endur
wast in impot passion for while i destroi hi hope i did
not satisfi my own desir thei were for ever ardent and crave still
i desir love and fellowship and i wa still spurn wa there no
injustic in thi am i to be thought the onli crimin when all
humankind sin against me why do you not hate felix who drove hi
friend from hi door with contum why do you not execr the rustic
who sought to destroi the saviour of hi child nai these ar virtuou
and immacul be i the miser and the abandon am an
abort to be spurn at and kick and trampl on even now my
blood boil at the recollect of thi injustic
but it is true that i am a wretch i have murder the love and
the helpless i have strangl the innoc as thei slept and grasp to
death hi throat who never injur me or ani other live thing i have
devot my creator the select specimen of all that is worthi of love and
admir among men to miseri i have pursu him even to that
irremedi ruin there he li white and cold in death you hate me but
your abhorr cannot equal that with which i regard myself i look on the
hand which execut the deed i think on the heart in which the
imagin of it wa conceiv and long for the moment when these hand
will meet my ey when that imagin will haunt my thought no more
fear not that i shall be the instrument of futur mischief my work
is nearli complet neither your nor ani man death is need to
consumm the seri of my be and accomplish that which must be done
but it requir my own do not think that i shall be slow to perform thi
sacrific i shall quit your vessel on the ic raft which brought me
thither and shall seek the most northern extrem of the globe i shall
collect my funer pile and consum to ash thi miser frame that it
remain mai afford no light to ani curiou and unhallow wretch who would
creat such anoth as i have been i shall die i shall no longer feel the
agoni which now consum me or be the prei of feel unsatisfi yet
unquench he is dead who call me into be and when i shall be no
more the veri remembr of us both will speedili vanish i shall no
longer see the sun or star or feel the wind plai on my cheek light
feel and sens will pass awai and in thi condit must i find my
happi some year ago when the imag which thi world afford first
open upon me when i felt the cheer warmth of summer and heard the
rustl of the leav and the warbl of the bird and these were all to
me i should have wept to die now it is my onli consol pollut by
crime and torn by the bitterest remors where can i find rest but in
death
farewel i leav you and in you the last of humankind whom these
ey will ever behold farewel frankenstein if thou wert yet aliv
and yet cherish a desir of reveng against me it would be better
satiat in my life than in my destruct but it wa not so thou
didst seek my extinct that i might not caus greater wretched
and if yet in some mode unknown to me thou hadst not ceas to think
and feel thou wouldst not desir against me a vengeanc greater than
that which i feel blast as thou wert my agoni wa still superior to
thine for the bitter sting of remors will not ceas to rankl in my
wound until death shall close them for ever
but soon he cri with sad and solemn enthusiasm i
shall die and what i now feel be no longer felt soon these burn
miseri will be extinct i shall ascend my funer pile triumphantli and
exult in the agoni of the tortur flame the light of that conflagr
will fade awai my ash will be swept into the sea by the wind my spirit
will sleep in peac or if it think it will not sure think thu
farewel
he sprang from the cabinwindow as he said thi upon the ic raft
which lai close to the vessel he wa soon born awai by the wave and
