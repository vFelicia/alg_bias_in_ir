the penguin of the antarct region veri rightli have been term the
true inhabit of that countri the speci is of great antiqu
fossil remain of their ancestor have been found which show that
thei flourish as far back as the eocen epoch to a degre far in
advanc of ani other bird the penguin ha adapt itself to the sea as
a mean of livelihood so that it rival the veri fish thi
profici in the water ha been gain at the expens of it power of
flight but thi is a matter of small moment as it happen
1 pygosc ad
in few other region could such an anim as the penguin rear it young
for when on land it short leg offer small advantag as a mean of
get about and as it cannot fly it would becom an easi prei to ani
of the carnivora which abound in other part of the globe here
howev there ar none of the bear and fox which inhabit the north
polar region and onc ashor the penguin is safe
the reason for thi state of thing is that there is no food of ani
descript to be had inland ag back a differ state of thing
exist tropic forest abound and at on time the seal ran about
on shore like dog as condit chang these latter had to take to
the sea for food with the result that their four leg in cours of
time gave place to wide paddl or flipper as the penguin wing
have done so that at length thei becam true inhabit of the sea
were the sealeopards2 the adli worst enemi to take to the land
again there would be a speedi end to all the southern penguin
rookeri as these howev ar inhabit onli dure four and a half
month of the year the advantag to the seal in grow leg again
would not be great enough to influenc evolut in that direct at
the same time i wonder veri much that the sealeopard who can squirm
along at a fair pace on land have not crawl up the few yard of
icefoot interven between the water and some of the rookeri as
even if thei could not catch the old bird thei would reap a rich
harvest among the chick when these ar hatch fortun howev
thei never do thi

when seen for the first time the adli penguin give you the
impress of a veri smart littl man in an even dress suit so
absolut immacul is he with hi shimmer white front and black
back and shoulder he stand about two feet five inch in height
walk veri upright on hi littl leg
hi carriag is confid as he approach you over the snow curios
in hi everi movement when within a yard or two of you as you stand
silent watch him he halt poke hi head forward with littl
jerki movement first to on side then to the other us hi right
and left ey altern dure hi inspect he seem to prefer us
on ey at a time when view ani near object but when look far
ahead or walk along he look straight ahead of him us both
ey he doe thi too when hi anger is arous hold hi head
veri high and appear to squint at you along hi beak as in

after a care inspect he mai suddenli lose all interest in you
and ruffl up hi feather sink into a doze stand still for a minut
till he ha settl himself to sleep then make sound enough to wake him
without startl him and he open hi ey stretch himself yawn
then final walk off care no more about you fig 2 and 3
the wing of adli like those of the other penguin have taken the
form of paddl and ar cover with veri fine scalelik feather
their leg be veri short thei walk slowli with a waddl gait but
can travel at a fair pace over snow or ic by fall forward on to
their breast and propel themselv with all four limb

dr loui gain of the french antarct expedit give us the
follow descript
the adli penguin is a brave anim and rare flee from danger if
it happen to be torment it face it aggressor and ruffl the black
feather which cover it back then it take a stand for combat the
bodi straight the anim erect the beak in the air the wing
extend not lose sight of it enemi
it then make a sort of pur a muffl grumbl to show that it
is not satisfi and ha not lost a bit of it firm resolut to
defend itself in thi guard posit it stai on the spot sometim
it retreat and ly flat on the ground push itself along with all
the forc of it claw and wing should it be overtaken instead of
try to increas it speed it stop back up again to face anew the
peril and return to it posit of combat sometim it take the
offens throw itself upon it aggressor whom it punish with blow
of it beak and wing
the adli penguin is excess curiou take great pain to inspect
ani strang object he mai see when we were wait for the ship to
fetch us home some of us live in littl tent which we pitch on the
snow about fifti yard from the edg of the sea parti of penguin
from cape royd rookeri frequent land here and almost invari
the first thing thei did on see our tent wa at onc to walk up the
slope and inspect these walk all round them and often stai to
doze by them for hour some of them inde seem to enjoi our
companionship when you pass on the seaic anywher near a parti of
penguin these gener come up to look at you and we had great
troubl to keep them awai from the sledg dog when these were tether
in row near the hut at cape evan the dog kill larg number of
them in consequ in spite of all we could do to prevent thi
the adli as will be seen in these page ar extrem brave and
though panic occasion overtak them i have seen a bird return time
after time to attack a seaman who wa brutal send it fly by
kick from hi seaboot befor i arriv to interfer an exact
descript of the plumag of the adli penguin will be found in the
appendix as it is more especi of their habit that i intend to
treat in thi work
befor describ these and with a view to make them more
intellig to the gener reader i will proce to a short
explan
the adli penguin spend their summer and bring forth their young in
the far south nest on the shore of the antarct contin and on
the island of the antarct sea thei ar alwai close to the water
be depend on the sea for their food as ar all antarct fauna
the frozen region inland for all practic purpos be barren of
both anim and veget life
their requir ar few thei seek no shelter from the terribl
antarct gale their rookeri in most case be in open windswept
spot in fact three of the four rookeri i visit were possibl in
the three most windi region of the antarct the reason for thi is
that onli windswept place ar so kept bare of snow that solid ground
and pebbl for make nest ar to be found
when the chick ar hatch and fulli fledg thei ar taught to swim
and when thi is accomplish and thei can catch food for themselv
both young and old leav the southern limit of the sea and make their
wai to the packic out to the northward thu escap the rigor and
dark of the antarct winter and keep where thei will find the
open water which thei need for in the winter the sea where thei nest
ar complet cover by a thick sheet of ic which doe not break out
until earli in the follow summer much of thi ic is then born
northward by tide and wind and accumul to form the vast raft of
what is call packic mani hundr of mile in extent which lie
upon the surfac of the antarct sea fig 4
it is to thi mass of float seaic that the adli penguin make
their wai in the autumn but as their further movement here ar at
present someth of a mysteri the question will be discuss at
greater length present
when young and old leav the rookeri at the end of the breed season
the new ic ha not yet been form and their long journei to the pack
ha to be made by water but thei ar wonder swimmer and seem to
cover the hundr of mile quit easili
arriv on the pack the first year bird remain there for two
winter it is not until after their first moult the autumn follow
their departur from the rookeri that thei grow the distinguish mark
of the adult black feather replac the white plumag which ha
hitherto cover the throat
the spring follow thi and probabl everi spring for the rest of
their live thei return south to breed perform their journei veri
often not onli by water but on foot across mani mile of frozen sea
illustr fig 4 pack ic on which the adli winter
two weddel seal ar seen on a floe
illustr fig 5 heavi sea in the autumn page 10
for those bird who nest in the southernmost rookeri such as cape
crozier thi journei must mean for them a journei of at least four
hundr mile by water and an unknown but consider distanc on foot
over ic
as i am about to describ the manner and custom of adli penguin at
the cape adar rookeri i will give a short descript of that spot
cape adar is situat in lat 71 14 s long 170 10 e and is a
neck of land jut out from the sheer and icebound foothil of
south victoria land northward for a distanc of some twenti mile
for it whole length the side of thi cape rise sheer out of the sea
afford no foothold except at the extrem end where a low beach ha
been form nestl against the steep side of the cliff which here
rise almost perpendicularli to a height of over 1000 feet
hurrican frequent sweep thi beach so that snow never settl there
for long and as it is compos of basalt materi freeli strewn with
round pebbl it form a conveni nest site and it wa on thi
spot that i made the observ set forth in the follow page
view befor the penguin arriv in the spring and after recent
wind had swept the last snowfal awai the rookeri is seen to be
compos of a seri of undul and mound or knoll while
sever sheet of ic vari in size up to some hundr of yard in
length and on hundr yard in width cover lower ly ground where
lake of thaw water form in the summer though doubtless the ridg and
knoll of the rookeri ow their origin mainli to geolog phenomena
their contour ha been much ad to as year by year the penguin have
chosen the higher emin for their nest becaus their guano which
thickli cover the higher ground ha protect thi from weather and
the denud effect of the hurrican which pass over it at certain
season and tend to carri awai the small fragment of ground that have
been split up by the frost
the shore of thi beach ar protect by a barrier of iceflo which
ar strand there by the sea in the autumn these floe becom weld
togeth and form the icefoot frequent refer to in these page
and photograph show how thi is done ar seen on fig 5 6 7 and
8
at the back of the rookeri nest site ar to be seen stretch up
the steep cliff to a height of over 1000 feet some of them be almost
inaccess so difficult is the climb which the penguin have made to
reach them

on duke of york island some twenti mile south of the cape adar
rookeri anoth breedingplac ha been made thi is a small coloni
onli as might be expect inde it is difficult to see why the
penguin chose thi place at all whilst room still exist at the bigger
rookeri becaus duke of york island until late in the season is cut
off from open water by mani mile of seaic so that with the except
of an occasion tide crack or seal blow hole the bird of that
rookeri have no mean of get food except by make a long journei on
foot when the arriv were stream up to cape adar mani were seen
to pass by make in a straight line for duke of york island and so
ad anoth twenti mile on foot to the journei thei had alreadi
accomplish
when the time arriv for the bird to feed some open lead had form
about half wai across the bai and those of the duke of york coloni were
to be seen stream over the ic for mani mile on their wai between
the water and their nest thei seem to think noth of long journei
howev as in the earli season when unbroken seaic interven
between the two rookeri parti of penguin from cape adar actual
us to march out and meet their duke of york friend half wai over
presum for the pleasur of a chat
to realiz what thi meant we must rememb that an adli penguin
ey be onli about twelv inch abov the ground when on the march
hi horizon is onli on mile distant thu from cape adar he could just
see the top of the mountain on duke of york island peep abov the
horizon on the clearest dai in anyth like thick weather he could
not see it at all and probabl he had never been there so in the first
place what wa it that impel him to go on thi long journei to meet
hi friend and when so impel what instinct point out the wai
thi of cours mere bring us to the old question of migratori
instinct but in the case of the penguin it horizon is so veri short
that it is quit evid he possess a special sens of direct in
addit to the special sens which urg him to go and meet the duke of
york island conting and i mai here remark that when we were
return to new zealand in the summer of 1913 we pass troop of
penguin swim in the open sea far out of sight of landan
unanswer repli to those naturalist who still maintain that
migrat bird must reli upon their ey for guidanc and thi remark
appli equal to the penguin we found on the northern limit of the

pack in the sea west of cape adar and south of the balleni island and
most like it is here that the adli repair when thei leav cape

the exact whereabout of the adli penguin dure the winter month
ha been much discuss by differ writer it is agre that thei
repair to the packic but our knowledg of the movement of thi pack
is veri vagu at the present time and so unfortun i can give but a
rough idea of the subject
i have collect and note down the latest evid for the benefit of
the zoologist of futur expedit who mai wish to investig the

probabl the inform which more nearli concern the penguin of cape

the fast period
diari from octob 13 to novemb 3 describ the arriv of the
adli penguin at the rookeri and habit dure the period of mate
and build
the first adli penguin arriv at the ridlei beach rookeri cape
adar on octob 13 a blizzard came on then with thick drift which
prevent ani observ be made the next dai when thi subsid
there were no penguin to be seen
on octob 15 two of them were loiter about the beach dure the
forenoon thei were separ but in the afternoon thei kept compani and
walk over to the southeast corner of the rookeri under the cliff of
cape adar where thei were shelter from the cold breez
on octob 16 at 11 am there were about twenti penguin arriv
sever came singli and on littl parti of three came up togeth on
arriv thei wander about by themselv and stood or walk about the
beach give on the impress of simpli hang about wait for
someth to turn up
by 4 pm there must have been close on a hundr penguin at the
rookeri it wa a calm dai and misti so that i could not see far out
across the seaic but so far it wa evid that the bird were not
arriv in batch but just dribbl in thei were then for the most
part squat about the rookeri well scatter some solitari other
in group and face in all direct fig 9 thei were not on the
promin where the nest site ar but in the hollow and on the
snow of the frozen lake there wa no sign of lovemak or ani
activ whatev all were in fine plumag and condit
dure the night of octob 16 the number of penguin increas greatli
and on the morn of the 17th there wa a thin sprinkl scatter
over the rookeri fig 11 a few were in pair or three but more in
group of a dozen or more and all the bird were veri phlegmat mani
of them ly on their breast with beak outstretch appar
asleep and nearli all as yesterdai in the hollow though there wa
no wind and awai from the nest site thei were veri quiet probabl
thei were fatigu after their journei perhap also thei were wait
the stimul of a greater crowd befor start their breed
oper as the guanocov ridg on which the old nest ar
were fairli soft and the pebbl loos thei were not wait for higher
temperatur in order to get to work
dure octob 17 the arriv becam gradual more frequent thei were
dribbl up from the seaic at the northend of the beach and soon
made a wellworn track up the icefoot whilst a long line of bird
approach in singl file with some gap extend to the horizon in a
northerli direct
dure the dai i notic some penguin take possess of old nest on
the ridg these mostli squat in the nest without ani attempt at
repair them or rearrang of ani sort afterward i found that
thei were unmat hen wait for mate to come to them and that thi
wa a veri common custom among them fig 10 if two occupi nest
within reach of on anoth thei would stretch out their neck and peck
at each other their endeavour seem to be to peck each other tongu
and thi thei frequent did but gener struck the soft part round
the margin of the bill which often becam a good deal swollen in
consequ often also their beak would becom interlock thei would
keep up thi peckpeck hour after hour in a most relentless fashion
fig 12 on on occas i saw a hen succe in drive anoth off
on of the old nest which she occupi the vanquish on squat on
the ground a few yard awai with rumpl feather and huffi
appear whilst the other walk on to the nest and assum the
ecstat attitud page 46 noth but animos could have induc
thi act as thousand of old unoccupi nest lai all around
about 9 pm a light snowstorm came on and those few bird who had
taken possess of nest left them and all now lai in the hollow
nestl into the fine drift which soon cover the ground to the extent
of a few inch a group of about a dozen penguin which arriv near
the icefoot in the morn halt on the seaic without ascend the
littl slope lead to the rookeri and stai there all dai
with the few except i have note abov all the bird that had
arriv so far either were much fatigu or els thei realiz that
thei had come a littl too soon and were wait for some psycholog
moment to arriv for thei were all strang quiet and inact
illustr fig 10 in the foreground a mate pair have begun to
build behind and to the right two unmat hen lie in their scoop
page 19
on octob 18 the weather clear and a fair number of penguin start
to build their nest the great major howev appar rest
still sat about those that built took their stone from old nest as
at present so mani of these lai unoccupi thei made quit larg nest
some inch high at the side with a comfort hollow in the middl
to sit in the stone carri fig 20 wa done by the male bird the
hen keep continu guard over the nest as otherwis the pair would
have been rob of the fruit of their labour as fast as thei were
acquir
as i stroll through the rookeri most of the bird took littl or no
notic of me some howev swore at me veri savag and on
infuri penguin rush at me from a distanc of some ten yard
seiz the leg of my windproof trouser in the morn quit a larg
number lai down on the seaic a few yard short of the rookeri
content appar to have got so far thei lai there all dai
motionless on their breast with their chin outstretch on the snow
by the even of octob 18 most of the penguin had gather in littl
group on the nestcov emin but there wa at that time ampl
room for all there be onli about three or four thousand arriv
although there were sever open water hole against berg frozen into
the seaic some half mile or so awai not a singl bird attempt to
get food
at 6 pm the whole rookeri appear to sleep and the ceaseless
chatter of the past hour gave place to a dead and impress
silenc though here and there an industri littl bird might be seen
busili fetch stone after stone to hi nest
at that date it wa deepli dusk at midnight though the sun wa veri
quickli rise in altitud and continu daylight would soon overtak
us
illustr fig 11 the rookeri begin to fill up page 18
by the morn of octob 19 there had been a good mani more arriv
but the rookeri wa not yet more than onetwentieth part full all the
bird were fast absolut nest build wa now in full swing and
the whole place wake up to activ most of the pebbl for the new
nest were be taken from old nest but a great deal of robberi went
on nevertheless depred when caught were driven furious awai and
occasion chase for some distanc and it wa curiou to see the
differ in the appear between the flee thief and hi pursuer
as the former race and duck about among the nest doubl on hi
track and try by everi mean to get lost in the crowd and so rid
himself of hi pursuer hi feather lai close back on hi skin give
him a sleek look which made him appear half the size of the irat
nesthold who sought to catch him with feather ruffl in
indign thi at first led me to think that the hen were larger
than the cock as it wa gener the hen who wa at home and the
cock who wa after the stone but later i found that sex make
absolut no differ in the size of the bird or inde in their
appear at all as seen by the human ey after mate their
behaviour as well as variou outward sign serv to distinguish male
from femal besid thi certain differ in their habit which i
will describ in anoth place ar to be note
the conscious of guilt howev alwai make a penguin smooth hi
feather and look small whilst indign ha the opposit effect
often when observ a knoll crowd with nest penguin i have seen
an appar unders individu slip quietli along among the
nest and alwai by hi subsequ proceed he ha turn out to be
a robber on the hunt for hi neighbour stone the other too seem
to know it and would have a peck at him as he pass them
at last he would find a hen seat unwarili on her nest slide up behind
her deftli and silent grab a stone and run off triumphantli with it
to hi mate who wa busili arrang her own home time after time he
would return to the same spot the poor depred nesthold be
quit oblivi of the fact that the side of her nest which lai behind
her wa slowli but sure vanish stone by stone
here could be seen how much individu charact make for success or
failur in the effort of the penguin to produc and rear their
offspr there ar vigil bird alwai alert who seem never to get
rob or molest in ani wai these have big high nest made with
pile of stone other ar unwari and get huf as a result there ar
a few even who from weak of charact actual allow stronger
natur and more aggress neighbour to rob them under their veri

the drastic punish thei receiv if thei ar caught by their
indign pursuer the onli disput that ever take place over the
question of properti ar on the rare occas when a bonafid
misunderstand aris over the possess of a nest these must be
veri rare inde as onli on on occas have i seen such a quarrel
take place the origin nest site be as i will show chosen by
the hen it is the ladi in everi case who is the caus of the battl
and when she is won her scoop goe with her to the victor
as i grew to know these bird from continu observ it wa
surpris and interest to note how much thei differ in charact
though the weakermind who would actual allow themselv to be
rob were few and far between as might be expect few if ani of
these ever could succe in hatch their young and win them
through to the feather stage
when start to make her nest the usual procedur is for the hen to
squat on the ground for some time probabl to thaw it then work
with her claw to scratch awai at the materi beneath her shoot out
the rubbl behind her as she doe thi she shift her posit in a
circular direct until she ha scrape out a round hollow then the
cock bring stone perform journei after journei return each
time with on pebbl in hi beak which he deposit in front of the hen
who place it in posit
sometim the hollow is line with a neat pavement of stone place side
by side on layer deep on which the hen squat afterward build up
the side around her at other time the scoop would be fill up
indiscrimin by a heap of pebbl on which the hen then sat work
herself down into a hollow in the middl
individu differ not onli in their build method but also in the
size of the stone thei select side by side mai be seen a nest compos
wholli of veri big stone so larg that it is a matter for wonder how
the bird can carri them and anoth nest of quit small stone
fig 14
differ coupl seem to vari much in charact or mood some can be
seen quarrel violent whilst other appear most affection and
the tender polit of some of these latter toward on anoth is veri
pretti to see fig 13

i mai here mention that the temperatur were rise consider by
octob 19 rang about zero f
dure octob 20 the stream of arriv wa incess some mingl at
onc with the crowd other lai in batch on the seaic a few yard
short of the rookeri content to have got so far and evid feel
the need for rest after their long journei from the pack the greater
part of thi journei wa doubtless perform by swim as thei
cross open water but i think that much of it must have been done on
foot over mani mile of seaic to account for the fatigu of mani of
them
their swim i will describ later on the ic thei have two mode of
progress the first is simpl walk their leg be veri short
their stride amount at most to four inch their rate of step
averag about on hundr and twenti step per minut when on the
march
their second mode of progress is toboggan when weari by
walk or when the surfac is particularli suitabl thei fall forward
on to their white breast smooth and shimmer with a beauti
metal lustr in the sunlight and push themselv along by altern
power littl stroke of their leg behind them
when quietli on the march both walk and toboggan produc the same
rate of progress so that the string of arriv bird tail out
in a long line as far as the horizon appear as a wellord
process i walk out a mile or so along thi line stand for some
time watch it tail past me and take the photograph with which i
have illustr the scene most of the littl creatur seem much out
of breath their wheezi respir be distinctli heard
first would pass a string of them walk then a dozen or so
toboggan fig 15 suddenli those that walk would flop on to
their breast and start toboggan and convers string of
toboggan would as suddenli pop up on to their feet and start walk
in thi wai thei reliev the monotoni of their march and gave
period rest to differ group of muscl and nervecentr
the surfac of the snow on the seaic vari continu and over ani
veri smooth patch the pedestrian almost invari start to
toboggan whilst over bad go thei all had perforc to walk
fig 16 17 18 and 19 present some idea of the process of these
thousand on thousand of penguin as dai after dai thei pass into the
rookeri

when toboggan turn to on side or the other is done with on or
more stroke of the opposit flipper when flee or chase both
flipper as well as both feet ar us in propuls and over most
surfac toboggan is thu their fastest mode of progress but when
go at full tilt it is also the most exhaust and after a short
spurt in thi wai thei invari return to the walk posit
by octob 20 mani of the nest were complet and the hen sat in them
though no egg were to be seen yet in the middl of on of the frozen
lake rose a littl island well suit for nest except for the fact
that later in the season probabl about the time when the young chick
were hatch the lake would be thaw and the approach to the island
onli to be accomplish through about six inch or more of dirti water
and ooz until then howev the surfac of the lake would remain
frozen and wa at thi time cover with snow
not a penguin attempt to build it nest on thi island though mani
pass it or walk over it in cross the lake how did thei realiz
that later on thei would get dirti everi time thei journei to or from
the spot
not far from thi island anoth mound rose from the lake but thi wa
connect with the mainland by a narrow neck of guanocov pebbl
thi mound wa cover with nest show that the bird understood
thi place could alwai be reach over dry land sure thi wa well
worth remark
there wa a part of the icefoot on the south side of the rookeri where
a track worn by mani ascend penguin could be seen lead from the
seaic on to the beach the place wa steep and the ic slipperi and
in fact the track led straight up a most difficult ascent not ten
yard from thi wellworn track a perfectli easi slope led up from the
seaic to the rookeri the track in the freshli fallen snow show
that onli on penguin had gone up thi wai presum the first arriv
in that place had taken the difficult path and all subsequ arriv
blindli follow in hi track whilst onli on had had the good luck or
independ to choos the easier wai
on octob 21 mani thousand of penguin arriv from the northerli
direct and pour on to the beach in a continu stream the snaki
line of arriv extend unbroken across the seaic as far as the ey
could see

a great mani now start to climb the height up the precipit side of
cape adar and to build their nest as far as the summit a height of
some 1000 feet although there wa still room for mani thousand more
down below what could be their object consid the wearisom
journei thei would have to make to feed their young it is imposs
to sai it might be the result of the same spirit which made them spread
out in littl scatter group over the rookeri when onli a few had
arriv and that thei prefer wider room onli put up with the
greater crowd which ensu later as a necessari evil there is
howev anoth explan which i will discuss in anoth place
at 9 pm it wa get dusk and the rookeri compar silent
although on some of the knoll two or three bird might be seen still
busili work toddl to and fro fetch stone the other thousand
lai at rest their white breast flat on the ground and onli their
black beak and head visibl as thei lai with their chin stretch

far awai from the beach the line had becom thicker and wa no longer

our presenc among them made littl or no differ to the penguin
when we pass them close thei would bridl up and swear or even run

crowd of penguin those that nest near us seem quickli to becom
us to us and to take less notic of us than those farther off on
thing howev terrifi them pitiabl we had to fetch ic for our

littl sledg as we haul thi rattl over the pebbl rookeri it
made a good deal of nois and in it path nest were desert the
occup flee in the greatest confus a clear road be left for
the sledg whilst on either side a line of penguin wa seen retreat
in the utmost terror after about a minut thei return to their
place and seem to forget the incid but we were veri sorri to
frighten them in thi wai as we endeavour to live at peac with them
and to molest them as littl as possibl and we fear that later on
egg might be spilt from the nest and broken as time went on those on
the rout of the sledg becam accustom even to thi and we were abl
to choos a cours which clear their nest
illustr fig 18 arriv at the rookeri in the background is

although squabbl and encount had been frequent sinc their arriv
in ani number it now becam manifest that there were two veri
differ type of battl first the ordinari quarrel consequ on
disput over nest and the robberi of stone from these and secondli
the battl between cock who fought for the hen these last were more
earnest and sever and were carri to a finish wherea the first
name rare proceed to extrem
in regard to the mate of the bird the follow most interest
custom seem to be preval
the hen would establish herself on an old nest or in some case scoop
out a hollow in the ground and sit in or by thi wait for a mate to
propos himself fig 26 she would not attempt to build while she
remain unmat dure the first week of the nest season when
plenti of fresh arriv were continu pour into the rookeri she
did not have long to wait as a rule later when the rookeri wa get
fill up and onli a few bird remain unmat in that vast crowd of
some threequart of a million her chanc were not so good
for exampl on novemb 16 on a knoll thickli popul by mate bird
mani of which alreadi had egg a hen wa observ to have scoop a
littl hollow in the ground and to be sit in thi dai after dai she
sat on look thinner and sadder as time pass and make no attempt
to build her nest at last on novemb 27 she had her reward for i
found that a cock had join her and she wa busili build her nest
in the littl scoop she had made so long befor her husband steadili
work awai to provid her with the necessari pebbl her forlorn
appear of the past ten dai had entir given place to an air of
occup and happi
as time went on i becam certain that invari pair took place
after arriv at the rookeri on octob 23 i went to the place where
the stream of arriv wa come up the beach and present follow a
singl bird which i afterward found to be a cock to see what it wa
go to do he thread hi wai through nearli the whole length of the
rookeri by himself avoid the tenant knoll where the nest were
by keep to the emptier hollow about everi hundr yard or so he
stop ruffl up hi feather close hi ey for a moment then
smooth himself out and went on again thu evid struggl
against desir for sleep after hi journei as he progress he
frequent poke hi littl head forward and from side to side peer
up at the knoll evid in search of someth
illustr fig 19 adli arriv at the rookeri

arriv at length at the south end of the rookeri he appear suddenli
to make up hi mind and boldli ascend a knoll which wa well
tenant and cover with nest walk straight up to on of these on
which a hen sat there wa a cock stand at her side but my littl
friend either did not see him or wish to ignor him altogeth he
stuck hi beak into the frozen ground in front of the nest lift up
hi head and made as if to place an imaginari stone in front of the hen
a most obviou piec of dumb show the hen took not the slightest notic
nor did her mate
my friend then turn and walk up to anoth nest a yard or so off
where anoth cock and hen were the cock flew at him immedi and
after a short fight in which each us hi flipper savag he wa
driven clean down the side of the knoll awai from the nest the
victori cock return to hi hen the newcom with the persist
which characteris hi kind came straight back to the same nest and
stood close by it soon ruffl hi feather and evid settl
himself for a doze but i suppos becaus he made no further overtur
the other took no notic of him at all as overcom by sheer
weari he went to sleep and remain so until i wa too cold to
await further develop on my wai back to our hut i follow anoth
cock for about thirti yard when he walk up to anoth coupl at a
nest and gave battl to the cock he too wa driven off after a short
and decis fight soon there were mani cock on the warpath littl
knot of them were to be seen about the rookeri the lust of battl in
them watch and fight each other with desper jealousi and the
later the season advanc the more bersac thei becam
a typic scene i find describ in my note for octob 25 when i wa
out with my camera and i mention it as a type of the hundr that were
proceed simultan over the whole rockeri and also becaus i wa
abl to photograph differ stage of the proceed as follow
fig 22 show a group of three cock engag in bitter rivalri round a

fig 25 show the end of the fight the victor have rush the
vanquish cock befor him out of the crowd and on to a patch of snow on
which as he wa too brave to turn and run he knock him down and gave
him a terribl hammer
when hi conqueror left him at length he lai for some two minut or so
on the ground hi heav breast alon show that he wa aliv so
complet exhaust wa he but recov himself at length he aros
and crawl awai a damag flipper hang limpli by hi side and he
took no further part in the proceed the victori bird rush back
up the side of the knoll and immedi fought the remain cock who
had not move from hi origin posit put him to flight and
chase him in and out of the crowd the fugit doubl and twist
amongst it in a frantic endeavour to get awai and i quickli lost sight

scene of thi kind becam so common all over the rookeri that the roar
of battl and thud of blow could be heard continu and of the
hundr of such fight all plainli had their caus in rivalri for the
hen
when start to fight the cock sometim peck at each other with
their beak but alwai thei veri soon start to us their flipper
stand up to on anoth and rain in the blow with such rapid
as to make a sound which in the word of dr wilson resembl that of

desper as these encount ar i dont think on penguin ever kill
anoth in mani case blood is drawn i saw on with an ey put out
and that side of it beak the right side clot with blood whilst
the crimson print of a bloodstain flipper across a white breast wa
no uncommon sight
hard as thei can hit with their flipper howev thei ar also well
protect by their feather and be marvel tough and endur
the end of a hard fight mere find the vanquish bird prostrat with
exhaust and with most of the breath beaten out of hi littl bodi
the victor is invari satisfi with thi and doe not seek to
dispatch him with hi beak
it wa veri usual to see a littl group of cock gather togeth in
the middl of on of the knoll squabbl noisili sometim half a
dozen would be lift their raucou voic at on particular bird then
thei would separ into pair squar up to on anoth and
emphas their remark from time to time by a few quick blow from
their flipper it seem that each wa indign with the other for
come and spoil hi chanc with a covet hen and try to get
them to depart befor he went to her
it wa useless for either to attempt overtur whilst the other were
there for the instant he did so he would be set upon and a desper
fight begin usual as in the case i describ abov on of the
littl crowd would suddenli see red and sail into an oppon with
desper energi invari drive him in the first rush down the side
of the knoll to the open space surround it where the fight would be
fought out the victor return to the other until by hi prowess and
forc of charact he would rid himself of them all then came hi
overtur to the hen he would as a rule pick up a stone and lai it in
front of her if she were sit in her scoop or if she were stand
by it he might himself squat in it she might take to him kindli or as
often happen peck him furious to thi he would submit tame
hunch up hi feather and shut hi ey while she peck him
cruelli gener after a littl of thi she would becom appeas he
would rise to hi feet and in the prettiest manner edg up to her
gracefulli arch hi neck and with soft guttur sound pacifi her and
make love to her

both perhap would then assum the ecstat attitud rock their
neck from side to side as thei face on anoth fig 26 and after
thi a perfect understand would seem to grow up between them and the
solemn compact wa made
it is difficult to convei in word the dainti of thi pretti littl
scene i saw it enact mani dozen of time and it wa wonder to
watch on of these hardi littl cock pacifi a fractiou hen by the
perfect grace of hi manner
fig 21 is particularli instruct in the centr of the pictur a
group of cock ar quarrel and on the lefthand side three unmat
hen can be seen sit in their scoop whilst two of them the two in
front ar receiv overtur from two of the cock who ar make the
most of their time whilst the other ar fight on the righthand
side anoth cock is seen propos himself to a fourth hen who seem to
be meet hi overtur with the usual show of reluct
although for the later arriv a good deal of fight wa necessari
befor a mate could be secur it seem that some got the matter fix
up without ani difficulti at all especi dure the earlier dai
when onli a few bird were scatter wide over the rookeri later the
cock seem to watch on anoth jealous and to hunt in littl
batch in consequ fig 27 28 and 29
from the particular i have just given it is also evid that a wife
and home onc obtain could onli be kept by dint of further battl
and constant vigil dure the first stage of domest when
thousand of lusti cock were pour into the rookeri and it wa not
unusu to see a strang cock pai court to a mate hen in the absenc
of her husband until he return to drive awai the interlop but i do
not think that thi ever occur after the egg had come and the
regular famili life begun coupl after thi be perfectli faith
to on anoth
the instanc i have given of a newli arriv cock by dumb show
pretend to take a stone and place it befor a mate hen is typic
of the sort of first overtur on see though more frequent an actual
stone wa tender while on thi subject i had better mention a most
interest thing which occur to on of my companion on dai as he
wa sit quietli on some shingl near the icefoot a penguin
approach him and after ey him for a littl walk right up to
him and nibbl gentli at on of the leg of hi windproof trouser
then it walk awai pick up a pebbl and came back with it drop
it on the ground by hi side the onli explan of thi occurr
seem to be that the tender of the stone wa meant as an overtur of
friendship

most unsuit for nest build thu it wa evid the bright

the piec of quartz were wrangl with their neighbour and a penguin

the skua had increas consider in number by novemb 4 and
frequent came to the scrapheap outsid our hut here were mani frozen
carcass of penguin which we had thrown there after the breast had
been remov for food dure the past winter the skua pick the bone
quit clean of flesh so that the skeleton lai white under the skin
and it wa remark to what distanc thei sometim carri the
carcass which weigh consider more than the skua themselv i
found some of these bodi over five hundr yard awai
a perpetu feud wa carri on between the penguin and the skua the
latter bird come to the south in the summer and make their nest close
to and in some case actual among those of the penguin and dure
the breed time live almost entir on the egg and later on the
chick thei never attack the adult penguin who run at them and drive
them awai when thei light within reach but as the skua can take to the
wing and the penguin cannot no pursuit is possibl
illustr fig 34 flood
illustr fig 35 a nest with stone of mix size
the skua fly about over the rookeri keep onli a few yard from the
ground and should on of them see a nest vacat and the egg expos
if onli for a few second it swoop at thi and with scarc a paus
in it flight pick up an egg in it beak and carri it to an open
space on the ground there to devour the content here then wa anoth
need for constant vigil and so dare did the skua becom that
often when a penguin sat on a nest carelessli so as to leav on of the
egg protrud from under it a lightn dash from a skua would result
in the egg be born triumphantli awai
the bitter of the penguin hatr of the skua wa well shown in
the neighbourhood of our scrapheap none of the food thrown out on to
thi heap wa of the least us to the penguin but we notic after a
time that almost alwai there were on or more penguin there keep
guard against the skua and do their utmost to prevent them from
get the food and never allow them to light on the heap for more
than a few second at a time in fact a constant featur of thi heap
wa the sentri penguin dart hither and thither aim savag peck
at the skua which would then rise a yard or two into the air out of
reach the penguin squall in it anger at be unabl to follow it
enemi at thi junctur the penguin would imit the fly motion with
it flapper seem instinct to attempt to mount into the air as
it remot ancestor doubtlessli did befor their wing had adapt
themselv sole to swim
close to the scrapheap there wa a larg knoll crowd with penguin
nest and it wa thi knoll that provid the sentri veri rare did
on of these leav the heap until anoth came to reliev it as long as
there were skua about but when the skua went the penguin left it
too when the skua return howev and without the laps of a few
second a penguin would be seen to detach itself from the knoll and run
to guard the heap that some primit understand on thi matter
exist among the penguin seem to me probabl becaus whilst there
were gener on or two guard the heap there wa never a crowd
the rest of the knoll seem quit satisfi as long as on of their
number remain on guard
in describ the cape adar rookeri i mention the fact that the
pebbl enter into the format of the beach ar basalt and
therefor of a dead black shade the result of thi is that as the sun
altitud increas heat is absorb readili by the black rock through
that clear atmospher and the snow upon it rapidli melt
illustr fig 36 hour after hour dure the whole dai thei
fought again and again page 68
for a long time the penguin at their nest had satisfi their thirst
by eat the snow near them but as thi disappear thei suffer
greatli as wa made evid by the wai thei lai with beak open and
tongu expos between them fig 30 as time went on the cock
start to make short journei to the drift which still remain in
order to quench their thirst but the hen stuck manfulli or rather
henfulli to their post though some of them seem much distress
later those cock which had nest in the centr of the rookeri had
quit long journei to make in order to find drift a veri popular
resort be that which had form in the lee of our hut and all dai
stream of them came here to gobbl snow onc a cock wa seen to take a
lump of snow in hi beak and carri it to hi mate on the nest who at
it
mr priestlei tell me that when he wa at cape royd in 1908 he saw
cock take snow to hen on their nest thi procedur would seem to
be differ to the parent instinct which govern the feed of the
young and it seem to show that the cock realiz that the hen must be
thirsti and in need of the snow and kept thi fact in mind when he wa
awai from her anoth point to note is that the occurr wa a veri
rare and in fact except on
when condit aros which were new to their experi the penguin
seem utterli unabl to grasp them
as an exampl of thi we had rig a guid rope from our hut to the
meteorolog screen about fifti yard awai to guid us dure
blizzard thi rope which wa support by pole driven into the
ground sag in on place till it nearli touch the ground at
frequent interv penguin on their wai past the hut were brought to a
standstil by run their breast into thi sag rope and each bird
as it wa caught invari went through the same ridicul procedur
first it would push hard against the rope then find thi of no
avail back a few step walk up to it again and have anoth push
repeat the process sever time after thi instead of go a few
feet further along where it could easili walk under the rope in nineti
per cent of case it would turn and by a wide detour walk right round
the hut the other wai evid convinc that some unknown obstacl
complet bar it passag on that side thi spectacl wa a
continu sourc of amus to us as it went on all dai and everi dai
for some time

as penguin egg ar veri good to eat and a great luxuri as well as
be benefici to men live under antarct condit we collect
a larg number which we stow awai to freez to collect these egg we
us to set off carri a bucket and walk through the knoll as we
pick our wai carefulli place our feet in the narrow space between
the nest we were savag peck about the leg as in most posit
at least these bird could reach us without even leav the nest
whilst veri often the mate stand near them would sail in at us
rain in blow with their flipper with the rapid of a maxim gun
to search for egg it wa necessari to lift up the occup of each nest
and look beneath her if she were tackl from front or flank thi wa a
pain and difficult busi as she drove at the intrud hand
with power stroke of her sharp beak but we found that the best wai
to set about the matter wa to dangl a fur mit in front of her with on
hand and when she seiz thi quickli slip the other behind her
lift her nether region from the nest and at the same time push
her gentli forward immedi she would drop the fur mit and stick
her beak into the ground push herself backward with a determin effort
to stai on the nest so long as the pressur from behind wa kept up she
would keep her beak firmli fix in the ground and could be rob at
will
the egg abstract she wa then left in peac on which she would rise
to her feet look under her for the egg and find that it wa gone
ruffl her feather and trembl with indign look round for the
robber seemingli quit unabl to realiz that we were the guilti on
thi is typic of the adli attitud toward us we ar beyond their
comprehens and fear of us anger at us curios over us although
frequent shown ar displai onli for a fleet moment in a few
minut she might forget about the incid altogeth and quietli
resum her posit on the empti nest but veri often she would
violent attack ani other bird who might happen to be stand near
and thu as we fill our bucket we left a line of alterc in our
wake thi howev wa not long live and affair soon settl down
to their normal state and i believ that in about on minut the affair
wa complet forgotten the penguin inde is in it natur the
embodi of all that man should be when he explor the antarct
region ever act on the principl that it is of no us to worri over
spilt milk

the compar size of the penguin egg is shown in some of my
photograph ninetysix egg averag 456 ounc apiec thei vari in

55 cm in breadth on an averag both end ar nearli equal round
and of a white chalki textur without and green within thi green
colour is plainli shown by transmit light
when the two have been laid the sit bird place them on in front of
the other the rearmost egg is tuck up on the outspread feet the
foremost li on the ground and is cover by the belli of the bird as
it li forward upon it fig 31 by mani of the bird a strong
inclin to burrow wa displai and thei seem veri fond of
delv in the soft shingl ledg that were to be found on some part
of the beach thei did thi ostens to get small stone for their
nest but certainli burrow deeper than thei need have done and
occasion squat for some time in littl cave that thei made in
thi wai i notic the same thing in the drift when thei went to eat
snow and thought at time that thei were go to make underground
nest but thei never did so though some of the littl shingl cave
would have made ideal nest site
by novemb 7 though mani nest were still without egg a larg number
now contain two and their owner start turn and turn about to go
to the open water lead about a third of a mile distant to feed and as
a result of thi a chang began gradual to come over the face of the
rookeri hitherto the whole ground in the neighbourhood of the nest had
been stain a bright green thi wa due to the fast bird
continu drop their wateri bilestain excreta upon it the
gall of penguin is bright green these excreta practic contain
no solid matter except epitheli cell and salt
the nest themselv ar never foul the excreta be squirt clear
of them for a distanc of a foot or more so that each nest ha the
appear of a flower with bright green petal radiat from it
centr some of the photograph show thi well especi fig 30 even
when the chick have come and ar be sat upon by the parent thi
still hold good becaus thei lie with their head under the old bird
belli and their hindquart just present themselv so that thei
mai add their littl decor offer petal by petal now that the
bird were go to feed the waterygreen stain upon the ground gave
place to the characterist bright brickr guano result from their
feed on the shrimplik euphausia in the sea and the colour of the
whole rookeri wa chang in a few dai though thi wa first
notic of cours in the region of those knoll which had been
occupi first and which were now settl down to the peaceabl and
regular famili life which wa to last until the chick had grown
illustr fig 40 a knot of penguin on the icefoot page 77
as thi famili life becam establish law and order reign to some
extent and there wa a distinct tendenc to preserv it notic on
those knoll which had so settl down and i think the follow most
surpris incid bear evid of what i have said i quot word for
word from my note on novemb 24 1911
thi afternoon i saw two cock probabl engag in a veri fierc
fight which last a good three minut thei were fight with
flipper and bill on of them be particularli clever with the
latter frequent seiz and hold hi oppon just behind the
right ey whilst he batter him with hi flipper
after a coupl of minut dure which each had the other down on the
ground sever time three or four other penguin ran up and appar
tri to stop the fight thi is the onli construct i can put on
their behaviour as time after time thei kept run in when the two
combat clinch push their breast in between them but make
no attempt to fight themselv whilst their more collect appear
and smooth feather were in mark contrast to the angri attitud of
the combat
the fight which had start on the outskirt of a knoll crowd with
nest soon edg awai to the space outsid and it wa here that i and
campbel who wa with me saw the other penguin try to stop it the
last minut wa a veri fierc and vindict mill both fight with
all their might and end in on of them try to toboggan awai from
hi oppon but he wa too exhaust to get ani pace on so that just
as he got into the crowd again he wa caught and both fought for a few
second more when the appar victor suddenli stop and ran awai
the other pick himself up and made hi wai rapidli among the nest
evid search for on in particular
follow him i saw him run up to a nest near the place where the
fight had begun there wa a solitari penguin wait by thi nest
which wa evid new and not yet complet and without egg the
cock i had follow ruffl and batter with battl ran up to the
wait bird and the usual sidetosid chatter in the ecstat
attitud began and continu for half a minut after which each becam
calmer and i left them appar reconcil and arrang stone in
the nest
thi incid wa after the usual natur of a disput between two mate
for a hen but the pacif interfer of the other bird wa quit new
to my experi that it wa pacif i am quit convinc and campbel
agre with me that there wa no doubt of it all the nest round about
had egg under incub and the pair in question must have been
newcom
illustr fig 41 an adli leap from the water page 82
on return home i wa glad to find that mr bernacchi who land at
cape adar with the southern cross expedit sai in hi account p
131 that he also saw penguin interf and try to stop other
from fight
ow to our have sever snowfal without wind and to the action of
the sun on the black rock which i have mention alreadi the rookeri
becam a mass of slush in mani place and in some of the lowerli
part actual flood in some of these lowli situat penguin
had unwarili made their nest and there wa on particular littl
coloni near our hut which wa threaten with total extinct from the
accumul of thaw water as thi trickl down from the higher ground
around them the occup of the flood ground exert all their
energi to avert thi calam and from each nest on of it tenant
could be seen make journei after journei for pebbl which it brought
to the on sit on the nest who place stone after stone in
posit so that as the water rose the littl castl grew higher and
higher and kept the egg dry on nest in particular i notic which wa
as yet a foot or so clear of the water and on dry ground but whilst the
hen sat on thi the cock wa work most energet in anticip
of what wa go to happen and for hour journei to and from the
nest each time wade across the littl lake to the other side where
he wa get the stone
thi scene which i photograph is depict on fig 33 in the
righthand corner of the pictur the cock is seen in the act of
deliv anoth stone to the hen who is wait to receiv it whilst
some of the nest ar actual surround by water fig 34 show
anoth nest rise like a littl island from a thaw pool the egg
be onli just abov water
illustr fig 42 adli leap from the water

page 82
some time ago i mention that there were penguin of weak individu
who allow other to rob them of their stone and thi wa in some
case veri notic on the flood ground and there were on or two
nest here which had been almost entir remov by thiev
neighbour
to quot again from my note
novemb 10 thi even i saw a hen penguin try to sit on a nest
with two egg the nest had no stone and wa scoop deepli in the
ground in a slush of melt snow so that the egg were nearli cover
with water the poor hen stood in the water and kept try to squat
down on the egg but each time she did so sat in the water and had to
get up again she wa shiver with cold and all bedraggl
i took the two egg out of the nest and brown and i collect a
heap of stone partli from her richer neighbour and built the nest
well up abov the water then i replac the egg and the hen at onc
gladli sat on them put them in posit and wa busili engag in
arrang the new stone round her when we left
on dai when the season wa well advanc i saw a violent alterc
take place between two penguin on of which wa in possess of a
nest in a somewhat isol posit the other evid wa do hi
utmost to captur the nest as whenev he got the other off he stood
on it there were scarc ani stone in the nest which contain on
egg i think from the wai thei fought that both were cock
for two reason i make special mention of the occurr first becaus
of all the fight i ever saw thi wa the longest and most relentless
and secondli becaus the nest be in such an isol posit it
seem curiou that there could be ani mistak about it ownership
such howev seem to be the case and hour after hour dure the
whole dai thei fought again and again
after each bout of a few minut both bird becam so exhaust that
thei sank pant to the ground evid suffer from thirst and at
the limit of their endur sometim on captur the nest sometim
the other but after sever hour of thi on of them began to show
sign of outlast the other and kept possess for long after thi
howev the other return repeatedli to the attack
illustr fig 43 jump from the water on to slipperi ic
page 82
i fetch my camera and photograph the bird as thei fought fig 36
as time went on the weaker bird took longer and longer interv to
recov between hi attack ly on hi breast with hi head on the
snow and ey half close so that i thought he wa go to die each
time he got to hi feet and stagger at hi enemi the latter rose from
the nest and met him onli to drive him back again when i saw them at
about 10 pm it wa perpetu daylight now both were ly down the
victor on the nest the vanquish about five yard off the next dai
on bird remain on the nest and the other had gone and i do not know
what happen to him
in the cours of a walk through the rookeri consider divers in
the choic of nest site wa to be notic the gener tendenc is
for the penguin to build their nest close togeth within a foot or
two of on anoth on the top of the round knoll the lower level
be left unten
the most thickli popul district were to be found on the scree
immedi below the cliff these scree have been form in the
first instanc by the fall of fragment due to weather of the
cliff their substanc is still ad to littl by littl as time goe
on and therefor mani ar kill annual by fall rock as is
mention elsewher but weigh against thi danger is the advantag
the cliff offer as a shelter from the es gale the same appli to
the nest site up the cliff but i am convinc that onli the love of
climb can account for the extraordinari posit chosen by some of
the bird some of the nest ar so difficult of access that their
occup on their wai to them mai be seen slide backward down the
littl glaze snowslop sever time befor thei accomplish the
ascent whilst in other place thei have to jump from on foothold to
anoth along the almost perpendicular cliff
even up these height a tendenc to group is seen though there ar a
fair number of individu who seem to seek seclus make their
nest at some distanc from the other i notic thi in some place
along the shore too where solitari nest were to be seen on isol
patch of shingl
when i visit cape royd in 1911 i found a coupl nest alon in a
cove known as black sand beach some half mile from the rookeri there
such isol as thi howev is veri unusu and wa quit a
departur from the regular custom of the speci
illustr fig 44 when thei succeed in push on of their
number over all would crane their neck over the edg page 83
in some place at cape adar larg rock some two or three feet in
height stood about the rookeri whenev the summit of on of these wa
access a pair built their nest upon it4 though how thei manag
to keep up there dure the gale wa a matter for wonder but the proud
possessor of the castl evid had a delight in their lofti
posit on nest had been made on an old packingcas left by the
expedit which winter there in 1894 and sever nest among the
weather bone of the seal that had di on the beach
4 fig 37
although the greatest care had been taken by nearli all in the choic of
site that would be on dry ground when the thaw came later in the
season yet a few hen had gone to the other extrem and with greatest
stupid chosen their site right down in the hollow where thei were
absolut certain to be flood later on these stupid on ar thu
prevent from rear their young and so select keep the wiser for
futur gener and elimin the less intellig from the
commun though perhap some of these learn by experi and next
year us more discrimin in choos their nest place
some of the coloniesin fact most of themwer orderli and well
arrang and later in the season distinctli peac other howev
present a less respect appear there wa on in particular
close to our hut which could onli be describ as a slum of the meanest
descript all through the season there wa more fight in thi
coloni than anywher els and so remark wa thi that we
christen the local casei court and the name stuck for the rest
of the year
the nest had fewer stone than elsewher and were more untidili made
and when the egg came ow to the constant fight that went on
most of them got spilt from the nest or broken and veri few chick
were hatch in consequ the mortal among them also be so
great that of the whole coloni of some hundr nest i do not think
more than forti or fifti chick at most reach matur the
explan of thi state of thing lai i believ in the fact that our
hut and it curtilag deflect the stream of penguin on their wai past
the spot from the water to the back of the rookeri so that a constant
stream of them pass through casei court upset the temper of
the inhabit so that thei becam disorderli in addit to thi
there wa a fairli big thaw pool and much miri ground near by so that
the inhabit were gener cover with mud and veri disreput to
look at
illustr fig 45 dive flat into shallow water page 83
dure the fast season as none of the penguin had enter the
water thei all becam veri dirti and disreput in appear as
well mai be imagin consid the life thei led but now that thei
went regularli to swim thei immedi got back their sleek and
spotless state
from the icefoot to the open water the half mile or so of seaic
present a live scene as the thousand of bird pass to and fro
over it outward bound parti of dirti bird from the rookeri pass
the spruce bather homeward bound after their banquet and frolic in the
sea so interest and instruct wa it to watch the bath parti
that we spent whole dai in thi wai
as i have said befor the coupl took turn and turn about on the nest
on remain to guard and incub while the other went off to the
water
on leav their nest the bird made their wai down the icefoot on to
the seaic here thei would gener wait about and join up with
other until enough had gather togeth to make up a decent littl
parti which would then set off gaili for the water thei were now in
the greatest possibl spirit chatter loudli and frolick with on
anoth and playfulli chase each other about occasion indulg
in a littl friendli spar with their flipper
arriv at length at the water edg almost alwai the same procedur
wa gone through the object of everi bird in the parti seem to be to
get on of the other to enter the water first thei would crowd up to
the veri edg of the ic dodg about and try to push on anoth
in sometim those behind nearli would succe in push the front
rank in who then would just recov themselv in time and rush
round to the rear endeavour to turn the tabl on the other
occasion on actual would get push in onli to turn quickli
under water and bound out again on to the ic like a cork shot out of a
bottl then for some time thei would chase on anoth about seemingli
bent on have a good game each bird intent on find ani excus from
be the first in sometim thi would last a few minut sometim
for the better part of an hour until suddenli the whole band would
chang it tactic and on of the number start to run at full tilt
along the edg of the ic the rest follow close on hi heel
until at last he would take a clean header into the water on after
anoth the rest of the parti follow him fig 38 all take off
exactli from the spot where he had enter and follow on anoth so
quickli as to have the appear of a lot of shot pour out of a
bottl into the water the accompani photograph present thi last
scene
illustr fig 46 dive flat into shallow water page 83
a dead silenc would ensu till a few second later when thei would all
come to the surfac some twenti or thirti yard out and start roll
about and splash in the water clean themselv and make sound
exactli like a lot of boi call out and chaf on anoth
so extraordinari wa thi whole scene that on first wit it we
were overcom with astonish and it seem to us almost imposs
that the littl creatur whose antic we were watch were actual
bird and not human be seemingli reluct as thei had been to
enter the water when onc there thei evinc everi sign of enjoy
and would stai in for hour at a time
as mai be imagin the penguin spent a great deal of time on their wai
to and from the water especi dure the earlier period befor the
seaic had broken awai from the icefoot as thei had so far to walk
befor arriv at the open lead
as a band of spotless bather return to the rookeri their white
breast and black back glisten with a fine metal lustr in the
sunlight met a dirti and bedraggl parti on it wai out from the
nest ground frequent both would stop and the clean and dirti
mingl togeth and chatter with on anoth for some minut if thei
were not speak word in some languag of their own their whole
appear beli them and as thei stood some in pair some in group
of three or more chatter amic togeth it becam evid that
thei were sociabl anim glad to meet on anoth and like mani
men pleas with the excus to forget for a while their duti at home
where their mate were wait to be reliev for their own spell off
the nest
after a variabl period of thi intercours the two parti would
separ and continu on their respect wai a clean stream issu
from the crowd in the direct of the rookeri a dirti on head off
toward the open water but here it wa seen that a few who had bath
and fed and were alreadi perhap halfwai home had been persuad to
turn and accompani the other and so back thei would go again over the
wai thei had come to spend a few more hour in skylark and splash
about in the sea
illustr fig 47 dive flat into shallow water page 83
in speak of these game of the penguin i wish to lai emphasi on
the fact that these hour of relax plai a larg part in their live
dure the advanc part of the breed period thei would spend hour
in plai at a sort of touch last on the seaic near the water
edg thei never plai on the ground of the rookeri itself but onli on
the seaic and the icefoot and in the water and i mai here mention
anoth favourit pastim of their i have said that the tide flow
past the rookeri at the rate of some five or six knot small iceflo
ar continu drift past in the water and as on of these arriv
at the top of the icefoot it would be board by a crowd of penguin
sometim until it could hold no more fig 39 thi excurs boat
as we us to call it would float it mani occup down the whole
length of the icefoot and if it pass close to the edg those that
rode on the floe would shout at the knot of penguin gather along
the icefoot fig 40 who would shout at them in repli so that a gai
banter seem to accompani their passag past the rookeri
arriv at the farther end some half a mile lower down those on the
excurs boat had perforc to leav it all plung into the tide
and swim against thi until thei came to the top again then board
a fresh floe for anoth ride down all dai these floe often crowd
to their utmost capac would float past the rookeri often a knot of
hesit penguin on the icefoot on be hail by a babel of
voic from a floe would suddenli make the plung and all swim off to
join their friend for the rest of the journei and i have seen a floe
so crowd that as a fresh parti board it on on side mani were
push off the other side into the water by the crush
onc as we stood watch the penguin bath on of them pop out
of the water on to the ic with a larg pebbl in it mouth which it
had evid fetch from the bottom thi surpris me as the depth
of the sea here wa some ten fathom at least the bird simpli drop
the stone on the ic and then dive in again so that evid he had
gone to all the troubl of dive for the stone simpli for the pleasur
of do it mr j h gurnei in hi book on the gannet sai thei
gannet ar said to have got themselv entangl in fishingnet at a
depth of 180 ft and that their descent to a depth of 90 ft is quit
authent so that perhap the depth of thi penguin dive wa not an
unusu on
illustr fig 48 dive flat
illustr fig 49 adli porpois page 80
the tide at the open water lead where thei bath ran a good six knot
but the adli swam quit easili against thi without leav the
surfac
in the water as on the land thei have two mean of progress the
first is by swim as a duck swim except that thei lie much lower
in the water than a duck doe the top of the back be submerg so
that the neck stick up out of the water as their feet ar veri
slightli web thei have not the advantag that a duck or gull ha
when swim in thi wai but supplement their footwork by short quick
stroke of their flipper thi thei ar easili abl to do ow to the
depth to which the breast sink in the water
the second method is by porpois
thi consist in swim under water us the wing or flipper for
propuls the action of these limb be practic the same as thei
would be in fly as their wing ar beautifulli shape for swim
and their pector muscl extraordinarili power thei attain great
speed besid which thei ar as nimbl as fish be abl complet
to doubl in their track in the flash of a moment in porpois after
travel thirti feet or so under water thei rise from it shoot
clean out with an impetu that carri them a coupl of yard in the
air then with an arch of the back thei ar head first into the water
again swim a few more stroke then out again and so on
i show a photograph of them do thi fig 49
perhap the most surpris feat of which the adli is capabl is seen
when it leap from the water on to the ic we saw thi best later in
the year when the seaic had broken awai from the icefoot so that
open water wash against the ic cliff bound the land thi littl
cliff rose sheer from the water at first but later by the action of
the wave wa undercut for some six feet or more in place so that
the ledg of ic at the top hung forward over the water the height of
most of thi upper ledg vari from three to six feet
illustr fig 50 a perfect dive into deep water page 83
whilst in the water the penguin usual hunt and plai in parti
just as thei had enter it though a fair number of solitari
individu were also to be seen when a parti had satisfi their
appetit and their desir for plai thei would swim to a distanc of
some thirti to forti yard from the icefoot when thei might be seen
all to stretch their neck up and take a good look at the propos
landingplac have done thi everi bird would suddenli disappear
beneath the surfac not a rippl show which direct thei had
taken till suddenli sometim in a bunch sometim in a stream on
after the other thei would all shoot out of the water clean up on to
the top of the icefoot fig 41 and 42 sever time i measur the
distanc from the surfac of the water to the ledg on which thei
land and the highest leap i record wa exactli five feet the take
off wa about four feet out from the edg the whole of the necessari
impetu be gain as the bird approach beneath the water
the most import thing to note about thi jump from the water wa
the accuraci with which thei invari rose at precis the right
moment the exact distanc be judg dure their momentari survei of
a spot from a distanc befor thei dive beneath the water and carri
in their mind as thei approach the ic i am sure that thi
impress wa all thei had to guid them as with a rippl on the
water and at the pace thei were go thei could not possibl have
seen their landingplac at all clearli as thei approach it besid
which in mani case the ledg of ic on which thei land project
mani feet forward from the surfac yet i never saw them misjudg their
distanc so as to come up under the overhang ledg
dure their approach thei swam at an even distanc of about three or
four feet beneath the surfac project themselv upward by a sudden
upward bend of the bodi at the same time us their tail as a helm in
the manner well shown in on of my photograph in which on of the
bird is seen in the air at the moment it left the water the tail be
bent sharpli up toward the back
their quick of percept is shown veri well as thei land on the
ic if the surfac is compos of snow and so afford them a good
foothold thei throw their leg well forward and land on their feet as
shown in fig 41 and 42 but should thei find themselv land on a
slipperi icesurfac thei throw themselv forward land on their
breast in the toboggan posit as shown in fig 43
the adli dive veri beautifulli we did not see thi at first befor
the seaic had gone out becaus to enter the water thei had onli to
drop a few inch but later when enter from the ic terrac we
constantli saw them make the most grace dive
illustr fig 51 sealeopard lurk beneath the overhang
ledg of the icefoot out of sight of the bird overhead page 84
at the place where thei most often went in a long terrac of ic about
six feet in height ran for some hundr of yard along the edg of the
water and here just as on the seaic crowd would stand near the
brink when thei had succeed in push on of their number over all
would crane their neck over the edg fig 44 and when thei saw the
pioneer safe in the water the rest follow
when dive into shallow water thei fall flat fig 45 46 and 47
but into deep water and from ani consider height thei assum the
most perfect posit fig 50 and make veri littl splash
occasion we saw them stand hesit to dive at a height of some
twenti feet but gener thei descend to some lower spot and did
not often dive from such a height but twelv feet wa no uncommon dive
for them
the reluct shown by each individu of a parti of intend bather
to be the first to enter the water mai partli have been explain when
later on we discov that a larg number of sealeopard were
gather in the sea in the neighbourhood of the rookeri to prei on the
penguin these formid anim of which i show some photograph
us to lurk beneath the overhang ledg of the icefoot out of
sight of the bird on the ic overhead fig 51 thei lai quit still
in the water onli their head protrud until a parti of adli
would descend into the water almost on top of them when with a sudden
dash and snap of their great formid jaw thei would secur on of
the bird
it seem to me then that all the chivvi and preliminari which
thei went through befor enter the water aros mainli from a desir
on the part of each penguin to get on of it neighbour to go in first
in order to prove whether the coast wa clear or not though all thi
manoeuvr wa certainli taken veri lightli and quit in the natur of
a game thi inde wa not surpris for of all the anim of which
i have had ani experi i think the adli penguin is the veri
bravest the more we saw of them the fonder we becam of them and the
more we admir their indomit courag the appear of a
sealeopard in their midst wa the on thing that caus them ani panic
with dozen of these enemi about thei would gambol in the sea in the
most lightheart manner but the appear of on among them wa the
signal for a stamped but even thi wa invari gone through in an
orderli manner with some show of reason for porpois off in a clump
thei at onc spread themselv out scatter in a fanshap format
as thei sped awai instead of all follow the same direct
illustr fig 52 a sealeopard head page 87
as far as i could judg howev the sealeopard ar a trifl faster
in the water than the adli as on of them occasion would catch
up with on of the fugit who then realiz that speed alon would
not avail him start dodg from side to side and sometim swam
rapidli round and round in a circl of about twelv feet diamet for a
full minut or more doubtless know that he wa quicker in turn
than hi great heavi pursuer but exhaust would overtak him in the
end and we could see the head and jaw of the great sealeopard rise to
the surfac as he grab hi victim the sight of a panicstricken
littl adli tear round and round in thi manner wa a sadli common
sight late in the season
sealeopard ar no mean custom and should be treat with caution
command campbel and i us to hunt them from a littl norwegian pram
a speci of dinghi which we row quietli up and down close under the
icefoot shoot at the sealeopard with a rifl when we saw their
head abov water
on dai we had an interest littl adventur we had shot and kill
on a fine bull about ten feet long which had sunk to the bottom in
some five fathom have just pull awai from him we were about ten
yard from the icefoot when anoth veri larg sealeopard overtook
us swim from the direct of the dead bull it pass under the
pram bump against the keel in do so when about ten yard ahead
of us it turn and made straight back for us but as we were bowson to
it it came right alongsid the boat churn up the water and wet
us at thi moment it turn on it side it right foreflipp beat
the surfac and it belli toward us and wa just start to rear it
head up when we both lung at it with our paddl and so push the
littl boat awai from it thi brought us alongsid the icefoot from
which campbel got a shot at it half a minut later and wound it in
the neck the moment after we lung at it with our paddl it dive
then reappear ten or fifteen yard off rear it head out of the
water and it wa at thi moment that campbel shot it after thi it
reappear sever time at the surfac but drift awai with the tide
and we lost it
illustr fig 53 a sealeopard 10 ft 6 in long
illustr fig 54 a young sealeopard on seaic page 87
the sealeopard ha not a reput for attack men in boat and
thi on mai have been actuat by curios mere but in favour of
it mean to attack us were first that it came to us straight from
the direct of the dead bull we had shot and secondli that it seem
hardli like that after bump against our keel mere curios could
have tempt it to come back and try to look over the gunwal as a rule
we had to drift veri quietli along when hunt sealeopard as the
slightest sound frighten them awai
all that we could do to protect our friend wa to shoot as mani of
these sealeopard as possibl but though we mai have made some
differ there were alwai mani about
some idea of the depred commit by these anim mai be gather
from the fact that in the stomach of on which we shot i found the
bodi of eighteen penguin in variou stage of digest the beast
intestin be liter stuf with the feather remain from the
disintegr of mani more photograph of these anim ar seen in
fig 52 53 and 54
though the actual presenc of a sealeopard put the adli to
confus caus them to porpois madli awai for a few hundr
yard yet onc awai from the immedi neighbourhood of the arch enemi
thei appear to think no more of him and behav as though there were
no further need for anxieti though probabl thei kept a sharp lookout
nevertheless evid goe to show that the sealeopard is the onli
live enemi except man that threaten the life of the adult adli
penguin
on dai as i watch some hundr of adli bath in an open lead
suddenli the back of an enorm killerwhal orca gladiat rose
abov the surfac as it cross the lead from side to side appear
from beneath the ic on on side and disappear beneath it on the
other to my surpris not the slightest fear wa shown by the bird in
the water had thi beast been a sealeopard there would have been a
stamped and everi bird have leapt from the water on to the seaic on
thi evid i form the opinion that in all probabl killerwhal
do no harm to adli penguin later i saw it confirm when a school
of killer shave close past sever floe that were crowd with
adli and made not the least attempt to get at them as thei might so
easili have done by upset the floe veri probabl thi is becaus
the agil bird can escap with such eas from the ponder whale and
fear it no more than a terrier fear a cow though he think twice
befor come within reach of it jaw

from the abov tabl it will be seen that the hen wa not reliev by

there wa onli on so that probabl she had been without food for a
month then she left and onli return to reliev the cock after the
laps of anoth fortnight it be worth remark that each wa

what with the exert of tramp with their burden across the rookeri
and perhap on rare occas on or two littl disput with other

to see an adli chick of a fortnight growth try to get itself
cover by it mother is a most ludicr sight the most it can hope
for is to get it head under cover the rest of it bodi be expos
to the air but the downi coat of the chick is close and warm and
suffic in all weather to protect it from the cold fig 60
illustr what i have said veri well whilst fig 61 show a mother
with a chick twelv dai old
whilst the chick ar small the two parent manag to keep them fed
without much difficulty6 but as on of them ha alwai to remain at
the nest to keep the chick warm guard them from skua and hooligan
cock and prevent them from strai onli on is free to go for food
later on howev two other factor introduc themselv the first of
these is that the chick downi coat becom thick enough to protect
them from cold without the warmth of the parent and the second that as
the chick grow thei requir an everincreas quantiti of food and at
the ag of about a fortnight thi demand becom too great for on bird
to cope with at thi time it is still necessari to prevent the chick
from strai and to protect them from the skua and hooligan and so
to meet these two demand a most interest social system is develop
the individu care of the chick by their parent is abandon and in
place of thi coloni start to pool their offspr which ar
herd togeth into clump or crche each of which is guard by a
few old bird the rest be free to go and forag
6 fig 62
illustr fig 60 a task becom imposs page 95
it is quit like that if a chick which ha escap from it own crche
join anoth crche it will get fed there as it seem hardli possibl
for the adult to recogn the individu of so larg a gather and
to detect a stranger should on turn up but there is good reason to
believ that the old bird work for their own crche onli and remain
faith to them for the rest of the season becaus as thei make their
wai across the rookeri laden with the food thei ar bring from the
sea it is sadli common to see them pursu by strai and starv
youngster plaintiv pipe their prayer for a meal and these
appeal ar alwai made in vain the old bird turn a deaf ear to the
youngster who at last weari and weak give up the pursuit and in the
end fall a prei to the everwatch skua further evid is found in
the fact that the chick at the veri back of the rookeri and up at the
top of the cape ar just as well nourish as those nearer the water
who ar constantli pass by a stream of foodladen parent
twice alreadi i have mention that strai chick fall a prei to
hooligan cock these hang about the rookeri often in littl band at
the begin of the season there ar veri few of them but later thei
increas greatli do much damag and caus a great deal of annoy to
the peac inhabit the few to be found at first probabl ar
cock who have not succeed in find mate and consequ ar at
a loos end later on as their number ar so greatli increas thei
must be widow whose mate have lost their live in on wai or
anoth
mani of the coloni especi those nearer the water ar plagu by
littl knot of hooligan who hang about their outskirt and should
a chick go astrai it stand a good chanc of lose it life at their
hand the crime which thei commit ar such as to find no place in thi
book but it is interest inde to note that when natur intend
them to find employ these bird like men degener in idl
some wai back i made some allus to the wai in which mani of the
penguin were choos site up the precipit side of the cape at the
back of the rookeri later i came to the conclus that thi wa pure
the result of their love of climb there wa on coloni at the veri
summit of the cape7 whose inhabit could onli reach their nest by
a long and try climb to the top and then a walk of some hundr yard
across a steep snow slope hang over the veri brink of a sheer drop of
seven hundr feet on to the seaic

dure the whole of the time when thei were rear their young these
mountain had to make sever journei dure each twentyfour hour
to carri their enorm belly of euphausia all the wai from the sea
to their young on the nestsa weari climb for their littl leg and
bulki bodi the greater number who had undertaken thi did so at a
time when there were ampl space unoccupi in the most elig part
of the rookeri
i have mention that larg mass of ic were strand by the sea along
the shore of the rookeri these fragment of berg some of them
fifteen to twenti feet in height form a miniatur mountain rang
along the shore all dai parti of penguin were to be seen assidu
climb the steep side of thi littl rang time after time when
half wai up thei would descend to try anoth rout and often when
with much pain on had scale a slipperi inclin he would come slide
to the bottom onli to pick himself up and have anoth try fig 63
gener thi climb wa done by small parti who had club
togeth as thei gener do from social inclin it wa not
unusu for a littl band of climber to take as much as an hour or more
over climb to the summit arriv at the top thei would spend a
variabl period there sometim descend at onc sometim spend
a consider time there gaze contentedli about them or peer
over the edg to chatter with other parti below
again about half a mile from the beach a larg berg some on hundr
feet in height wa ground in fairli deep water access at first
over the seaic but later when thi had gone surround by open
water it side were sheer except on on side which slope steepli
from the water edg to the top
from the time when thei first went to the sea to feed until the end of
the season there wa a continu stream of penguin ascend and
descend the berg as i watch them through glass i saw that thei
had worn deep path in the snow from base to summit thei had absolut
noth to gain by go to all thi troubl but the pleasur thei
seem to deriv from the climb and when at the top mere had a good
look round and came down again
illustr fig 62 a coupl with their chick page 96
when the bird were arriv at the rookeri i watch for those who were
to nest up the cliff and sever time saw bird on arriv at the
rookeri make for the height without ani hesit thread their wai
almost in a straight line through the nest to the scree at the bottom
of the cliff and up these to on or other of the path lead up it
side probabl these had been hatch there or had nest there befor
and were make their wai to their old haunt but my note on their
nest habit go to show that the cock at ani rate cannot keep to
the same spot dure success year it is the hen who choos the
site and stai on it as i have shown until a mate come to her and
win her veri often onli after defeat mani other competitor

some of the item in my list requir explan the scree at the foot
of the cliff at cape adar ar perhap the most thickli popul part
of the rookeri as the thaw proce boulder of differ size ar
continu fall down the cliff some of them for mani hundr of
feet befor thei final plung in among the nest on the scree do
terribl damag and often roll some distanc out into the rookeri
at other time ow to the burst out of thaw water which ha been
dam up at the top of the cliff larg landslid ar caus which
buri mani hundr of nest beneath them in fact these scree on which
the nest ar built have been form by these landslid take place
from year to year and no doubt form the grave of thousand upon
thousand of former gener on of these slide took place whilst
we were at the rookeri do terribl damag a crowd coloni of
adli were nest just below and the avalanch pass right through
and over them caus the most sad havoc we found hundr of injur
and dy some of them in a pitiabl condit sever were complet
disembowel other had the whole skin of their back torn down and
hang behind them in a flap expos the bare flesh dozen had
broken or disloc leg and flipper
the worst featur wa that mani were buri aliv beneath the snow or
pin down to the ground by mass of basalt twice i saw on flipper
stick out of the snow move dismal and dug out in each case a
badli injur bird which would have linger perhap for dai becaus
loos snow doe not alwai suffoc ow to the amount of air
contain in it interstic and to the fact that diffus take place
through it veri readili sever of us spent a long time in kill with
iceax those that seem too badli injur to recov
it wa remark to see the wai in which all the nest which had
escap the avalanch howev narrowli were still sat upon by their
occup as if noth had happen also i saw sever badli injur
bird sit on their egg some of them soak in blood so that thei
look like crimson parrot the amount of bloodsh must have been
great as the snow wa dy with blood in all direct as a cascad
of water follow the avalanch and continu for some hour spread
out into littl river among the nest mani were be delug and
some of the penguin actual were sit in the run water in a
vain attempt to keep warm their drown chick and spoil egg
sometim dig at hazard in the drift snow i came on bird that
had been deepli buri and though thei were held down and kept
motionless by the weight of the snow cover them most of them were
aliv and i have no doubt mani dozen di a linger death in thi
wai such as had mere suffer broken flipper or leg i spare and
the next dai nearli all of these seem to be do well on bird i
found sit on two egg which were in the middl of a rivulet of
water so i lift them out and put them on dry ground close by but the
parent would have noth to do with them after thi
illustr fig 64 adli on the icefoot
a featur of the abov scene which on could not help notic wa
that howev badli a penguin wa injur it wa never molest by the
other as is almost invari the rule among other bird includ
their near neighbour the skua i have seen a sick skua hunt
continu for over an hour by a mob of it own kind who would not
allow it to settl on the ic for a moment rest
anoth item of my list requir explan is snowdrift
dure both spring and summer there ar occasion snowstorm and
dure these the bird sit tight on their nest sometim be cover
up by drift as a rule the bird on the nest keep a space open by poke
it head upward through the snow but sometim it becom complet
buri air diffus so rapidli through snow that death doe not take
place by suffoc and the bird can live for week beneath a drift
sit on it nest in the littl chamber which it ha thaw out by it
own warmth gener after a few hour the snow abat and settl down
suffici to expos the nest onc more but sometim a breez
spring up which is not strong enough to blow the snow awai but simpli
harden the surfac of the drift into a crust which last for sever
week and the bird ar imprison in consequ then littl black
dot ar seen about the surfac of the drift which ar the head of
penguin thrust through their breath hole
on on such occas i wit an interest littl incid an
imprison hen wa poke her neck up through her breath hole when
her mate spi her and came up he appear to be veri angri with her
for remain so long on the nest be unabl to grasp the reason and
after swear at her for some time he start to peck at her head she
retali as far as her cramp posit would allow when she
withdrew her head he thrust hi down the hole till she drove it out
again and as thi state of thing seem to be go on indefinit i
came up and loosen the crust of snow which imprison her on which
she burst out and seem glad to do so she wa cover with mire
have for mani dai been sit in a pool of thaw water which had
swamp her nest and evid spoilt the egg when i put her back on
the nest she sat there for some time but eventu thei both
desert i should sai that some hundr of nest were spoilt in thi
wai

neighbour whom thei seem to hate but onli retali on those within
reach us their bill onli to peck at each other head without

the cock howev ar less depend start a quarrel in the same
wai as the hen do their milit instinct soon becam arous on
which thei ar apt to jump up and start a furiou fight with flipper
stagger to and fro over their nest and veri often spill the
egg which ar lost in consequ on certain occas i wa abl to
interfer between the combat and replac the egg on which thei
would return to their domest duti and seem to forget the incid a
good mani egg must have been lost in thi wai dure the season
late in the season an occurr took place for which i have never been

multitud of them stand for hour without ani appar purpos a
good idea of thi scene mai be got from the frontispiec
on morn mr priestlei came into the hut and told me that the
penguin were drill on the seaic and that i had better come and
look at them i went with him to the icefoot and thi is what we saw
mani thousand of adli were on the seaic between the icefoot and
the open water lead then some quarter of a mile distant near the
icefoot thei were congreg in littl band of a few dozen whilst
farther out near the water mass band some thousand strong stood
silent and motionless both the small and the larg band kept an almost
rectangular format whilst in each band all the bird face the same
wai though differ band face in differ direct
illustr fig 66 adli on the icefoot
as we watch it becam evid that someth veri unusu wa go
on first from on of the small band a singl bird suddenli appear
ran a few yard in the direct of anoth small band and stop in
the flash of a moment the entir band from which he came execut the
movement left turn thi bring them all into a posit face him
so well order wa the movement that we could scarc believ our
ey then from the small band our singl bird had approach anoth
singl bird ran out upon which hi own parti did exactli as the first
had done so that the two band now stood face on anoth some
fifteen yard apart
illustr arrow show direct in which all the bird face
then spontan the two band march straight toward on anoth
and join to form on bodi after thi we saw the same procedur be
enact in mani other place the penguin come down from the rookeri
and form small band which join togeth then the augment bodi
would join other augment bodi to form still larger on which then
join togeth and so on until a great mass of bird stood togeth in
row all face in on direct like a regiment of soldier on of
these mass stood not far from us a compact rectangular gather as
shown on page 109
thei stood thu for a long time quit motionless and silent when
suddenli as befor a singl bird dart out from among the crowd and
ran a few yard toward the open water when as if it had receiv a
word of command everi bird face left as in the diagram below
illustr arrow show direct in which all the bird face
after thi the whole crowd march for the water keep it format
almost unchang till it arriv at the edg of the ic when it halt
and subsequ enter the water in batch

page 106
thi procedur continu for mani hour the penguin that dai observ
thi extraordinari behaviour the most astonish part of which lai in
the accuraci of their drilllik movement so that we might have been
watch a lot of soldier on parad perhap the sudden motion of
these bodi of bird were brought about by a sound utter by the
singl bird which act as leader though we did not hear thi the
actual reason for thi departur from their usual custom is beyond my
knowledg there wa noth to be seen to account for it but the
penguin evid obei some instinct which affect them all on thi
and two subsequ occas when the same thing took place
my own idea is that in former time the penguin us to mass togeth
as other bird do befor their annual migrat perhap as far back as
the dai when their wing were adapt for flight and that the
phenomenon describ abov wa a relic of their bygon instinct
when the chick down ha been moult and their plumag acquir thei
proce to the water edg and here thei learn to swim
in the autumn of 1912 at a small rookeri which i came upon on
inexpress island i had an opportun of watch their first
attempt in thi direct crowd of young adli were to be seen on
the pebbl beach below their rookeri much of the ic have disappear
at thi late season leav bare patch of shingl which were veri
suitabl for the first swim lesson
mani old bird paddl in for a short distanc and crouch in a few
inch of water splash about with their flipper to give the
youngster a lead some of the latter need littl encourag and
took readili to the strang element veri soon swim about in deep
water but other seem more timid and these latter were urg in
everi possibl wai by the old bird some of whom could be seen walk
in and out of the water and so do what thei could to give their
charg confid
in thi duti on or two old bird might be seen with a littl crowd of
youngster so that evid the social instinct which gave rise to
the crche system in the first place were extend to the tuition of the
young and thu to their prepar for the journei north
illustr fig 69 when she broke out thei becam reconcil

illustr fig 70 adli nest on top of cape adar to reach
which thei must make a precipit climb of 1000 feet page 98
up in the rookeri fulli fledg youngster could be seen clamour in
vain for food the old bird resolut refus to feed them now that
thei were abl to forag for themselv the adult who instruct the
young in the water had finish their moult and were themselv readi
to depart mani other howev still wander disconsol about the
land some of them onli half fledg and mope under boulder or ani
sort of shelter from the chilli breez and long after all the
youngster had depart solitari moult bird were to be found
emaci and miser patch of loos feather still cling to the
new coat which wa make such a tardi growth in some place we found
these old bird in hole under the rock the old moult feather
make some sort of a bed which help to protect their late wearer
from the cold
both at cape adar in 1910 and at inexpress island in 1911 i found
that though young and old left the rookeri simultan at first yet
after all the young had depart mani adult still remain behind ow
to the late of their moult and thi is directli at varianc with
the remark of mr borchgravink on the subject becaus he sai that the
old bird all leav the rookeri first abandon the young who ar
driven by necess to take to the water and learn to swim
well inde wa it for my companion and me that thi wa so for in the
autumn of 1912 we were in sore strait for food and had it not been
that at a veri late date we collect some nineti old moult bird on
inexpress island i doubt if we would have seen the sun rise in the
next spring
at cape adar in 1911 half the rookeri had depart when we arriv in
the autumn the rest took to the sea in batch some hundr strong
these parti wander about the beach and icefoot in compani for some
time then enter the water and swim northward thei were seen no
more
those that moult sometim remain solitari whilst in the acut
stage but nevertheless moult parti often were seen look veri
miser doubtless feel in their unprotect state the effect of
wind which were get keener and more sever now that the sun wa
depart
when all the youngster had gone some thousand of old bird still
remain and wait for mani dai after thei had acquir their full
plumag befor thei left then these in time disappear leav the
rookeri empti and desol on march 12 i photograph the last parti
all blackthroat adult two dai later a coupl appear on the
beach appar have come back for a last look at us then these
too disappear and as we look at the empti silent beach we could
not help contrast it with the nois and bustl of a short time ago
the last penguin had gone and the sun disappear below the horizon
left us alon with the antarct night

the oldest stock of all accord to dr bowdler sharp the colour of
the head is in all case blacker in the earlier stage than the rest of

as the chick ag the colour of it down chang and all of it take on
a dull rusti brown colour as it moult the abdomen and thigh chang

separ the white from the black area the flipper ar the same

in addit to the distinct pure white plumag of the throat the

which is that the eyelid ar black as in the chick and do not acquir
the stare white which is so distinct of the adult adli
penguin increas as it doe the white area of the sclerot so that
the bird ha the appear of be perpetu surpris or veri

mccormick skua gull
a book which treat of adli penguin scarc can be complet without
refer to the beauti mccormick skua gull megalestri
maccormicki as probabl no adli rookeri exist without it
attend band of skua who build their own nest veri close to and
occasion among those of the penguin on whom thei prei almost
entir support themselv and their young upon the egg and young
offspr of their host
mention ha been made of these bird from time to time through the
previou page and some idea of their habit alreadi will have been
form in point of fearless thei fall somewhat short of the adli
but exhibit perhap rather more caution in their deal with man
than the gull who visit st jamess park in london and ar fed by the
children there frequent from the hand though probabl in a veri few
dai thei might becom extrem tame were their short experi of
mankind made less bitter the major of explor like most men
though kindli by natur ar entir thoughtless in their deal with
wild anim and the skua approach them onli to be kill or sever
injur by the iceax or rock that ar thrown at them in wanton sport
as thei light on the ground or hover near the visitor whom thei
quickli discov to be their bitter and relentless foe
arriv at the rookeri somewhat later than the adli thei do not
lai their egg until the begin of decemb practic no nest is
made a mere hollow be work in the ground in which the bird sit
frequent sever hollow ar made befor the hen final settl where
she will lai the two egg which ar brownish oliv thickli and darkli
mottl with brown ar incub for four week after which the chick
ar hatch
from the moment of their first appear from the egg these chick
exhibit the most extraordinari precoc cover with pale slatygrei
down thei look anyth but the pugnaci littl anim thei turn out
to be their on idea besid feed seem to be to fight on
anoth and thei mai be seen to roll about the nest lock togeth
fight with beak and claw thei ar fed from the ground and mai be
seen pick about among the stone like the littl domest chicken
which thei veri much resembl after a time invari on of the chick
disappear and as dead youngster ar not to be found thei ar
probabl eaten by neighbour who have caught them wander in fact
mr ferrar of captain scott first expedit actual saw a skua
pick up a wander chick of it own speci and fly off with it
follow by a scream flock of it neighbour who sought to rob it of
it prei
in order to find out how mani egg a skua would lai i mark some
nest and took the egg as thei were laid in each case a second egg
wa laid but when thi wa taken no more appear in two nest i
remov the first egg as soon as it wa laid but left the second which
wa then sat upon by the parent who wa content with it or unabl to
lai a third
when ani of us approach their nest the old bird would fly round in
wide circl make wild stoop at our head each time thei pass
over us in the evid attempt to frighten us awai occasion thei
would actual knock our head with a wing and noth seem to scare
them off thei would swoop past us time after time in a most
disconcert manner in order to keep them at a distanc without have
to keep a constant lookout when i wa in the neighbourhood of their
nest i us to walk about hold a skistick or the handl of my
iceax straight abov me and thei would swoop at the top of thi
instead of my head which wa infinit prefer on dai when a high
wind wa blow on top of cape adar i had my iceax knock clean
out of my hand by on of the skua fly straight into the handl the
heavi blow seem to affect the bird but slightli
there wa a skuari on the scree close to a thickli popul part of
the rookeri but the major of these bird made their nest right at
the top of cape adar from which point of vantag thei survei the
entir rookeri and a veri sharp lookout thei kept too for no sooner
did we start to flens a seal than a flock of them descend to gobbl
at the lump of blubber as we threw them on the ground in thi
occup thei exhibit the greatest jealousi and when there wa a
hundr time as much blubber on the ground as all the skua possibl
could have eaten thei continu tri to drive each other awai when
fight thei rare stai on the ground but leapt at on anoth into
the air and on of the illustr show two skua in the act of
do thi their great spread of wing is well shown in thi photograph
fig 71
when penguin egg were plenti in the rookeri the skua flew veri
low over the ground and as thei pass over each coloni of nest the
sit bird would crouch low upon them a veri necessari precaut
as i have describ alreadi in these page the uner wai in which the
skua pick up the penguin egg when thei were left uncov broken
and empti shell strew the ground in the vicin of the skua nest
and it is probabl that in a larg rookeri such as that at cape adar
thousand of egg ar destroi by them annual
the instinct of the thief is most strongli mark in the skua tribe and
i am afraid that the mere love of thiev alon actuat them on mani
occas for instanc when i wa skin a seal on dai near cape
evan i left a pair of fieldglass ly on a coat close by and on
look round saw a skua in the act of make off with them hold
them by the strap in hi beak a sudden yell caus the offend to drop
the glass fortun when thei were but a yard from the ground
again when the crew of an antarct ship were engag in blast the
seaic which imprison it a skua flew off with on of the deton
which had been left on the ic i think the deton contain
dynamit but at ani rate i am told that there wa a stamped on the
part of the men to get awai from under the bird as it flew overhead
when with two companion i visit a skuari at the back of the penguin
rookeri at cape royd the skua circl over us in a wai i have
describ abov but instead of swoop at our head some of them
repeatedli drop their guano on to us as thei pass over time the
process with such surpris accuraci that i wa hit onc and command
campbel no less than three time the follow year when at cape
adar i expect the same treatment from the skua there but curious
enough these never did it that on skuari should have adopt such
tactic and anoth not is a veri curiou thing but it mai possibl be
that the cape royd skua discov the trick dure the stai of sir
ernest shackleton expedit who had spent a year there quit
recent and of the discoveri expedit which spent two year at hut
point but a few mile distant wherea the onli men who ever inhabit
cape adar winter there some fifteen year befor but thi is mere
specul

approach of anyon it throw it head back open it wing and loudli
proclaim it whereabout with it raucou caw note when hover
over food and at other time when not alarm or angri the sound made
by a skua ar veri like those of the common her gull and not
altogeth unmus at time especi when make the littl shrill
pipe note by which i have often thought that gull so nearli imit
the squeak of a block in it sheaf
when the penguin chick ar hatch the skua prei upon these in a most
cruel manner and should a chick wander awai from the protect old
bird a skua is almost certain to pounc upon and kill it thi it doe
by peck it ey out after which with power stroke of it beak
it get to work on it back and quickli devour the kidnei
the dead bodi of hundr of chick ar seen strewn about the rookeri
and especi in the neighbourhood of the skua nest as veri often
thei carri them there all these dead chick ar seen to have two hole
pick through their back on on each side correspond to the
posit of each kidnei
besid the penguin egg and young there is anoth fruit sourc
of food for the skua to be found along the antarct coast at the
earli part of the year and that is dure the time when the seal ar
bring forth their young upon the seaic the skua attend upon them
then and devour the afterbirth in the second volum of the
discoveri report dr wilson mention that larg number of skua were
notic at granit harbour and i have no doubt that thei had
congreg there for thi purpos as when pass the spot on a spring
journei along the seaic in 1912 we saw mani hundr of weddel seal

a short note on emperor penguins9
9 aptenodyt forsteri
the emperor is by far the largest of all penguin weigh between 80
and 90 lb it is also a particularli handsom and grace bird by
natur it seem much like the adli except that it gener demeanour
is extrem dignifi and it gait as it approach you over the
snow slow and deliber
the most mark differ in the habit of the adli and the emperor
li in the respect season at which each lai and incub it
egg unlik the adli which as we have seen choos the warmest and
lightest month of the year for the rear of it young the emperor
perform thi duti in the darkest coldest and most tempestu time
the onli reason that ha been suggest for thi custom is that mani
month must pass befor the chick ar fulli fledg were thei hatch
in decemb midsumm as ar adli autumn would find them still
unfledg and probabl thei would perish in consequ wherea be
hatch in the earli spring thei ar foster by their parent until
the warmer weather begin and then have the entir summer in which to
accomplish their chang of plumag

the onli emperor rookeri known to man at the present dai wa discov
by lieut royd and skelton of captain scott first antarct
expedit on the seaic beneath cape crozier here in the dark dai
of juli thi extraordinari bird lai it on egg upon the ic
in the winter of 1911 a veri brave journei wa made to thi spot by a
parti of captain scott offic consist of dr wilson lieut
bower and mr cherrygarrard the experi of thi littl band were
so terribl that it is remark thei ever return to tell of them
temperatur of 78 f were encount and the most sever blizzard
at lower temperatur than ani sledgingparti had yet endur under
these truli terribl condit the emperor lai their egg and hatch
their young
the mortal under such circumst is veri high as on would
expect avalanch of ic fall from the cliff abov crush mani of
the parent bird and caus hundr of egg to be desert as dr
wilson state the ic cliff beneath which these remark anim sat
were so unstabl that no man in hi sens would camp for a singl night
beneath them in spite of thi evid show that after an avalanch
of ic block from abov which had caus some of the emperor to leav
their egg on the ic and bolt in terror mani of them had return and
continu to sit on the egg which had been frozen and kill by the
frost in their absenc continu to do so long after thei were
complet rotten inde in their desir for someth to hatch some
who had been depriv of their egg were seen to be attempt to
incub piec of ic in their place and unlik adli thei seem
ever readi to snatch and foster the young of their neighbour
the first time the rookeri at cape crozier wa visit not abov on
thousand bird occupi it on the second occas their number were
far short of thi by the springtim onli on out of ten or twelv bird
ar seen to be rear young so it is obviou other rookeri await
discoveri in other part as there ar a larg number of emperor to be
seen along the antarct coast
illustr fig 74 profil of an emperor page 134
when in the terra nova we made our wai along the face of the great
barrier to the eastward we saw larg number of emperor especi to
the extrem eastward where a heavi hang of packic block our further
passag and i have littl doubt that futur explor will disclos a
rookeri or rookeri in thi direct
again in the spring of 1912 when near the end of a sledg journei
from the northward to cape evan we pass larg gather of emperor
penguin on some veri old seaic under the barrier edg along the
southern end of mcmurdo sound and it seem not at all unlik that
thei mai breed here too unfortun we were unabl at that time to
make detour so had to leav the question unsettl but if thei do
breed here thei must have far to go to get food dure those winter
when the seaic doe not break out of the sound
the growth of the emperor chick is slow when compar with the
mushroomlik rate at which the adli youngster increas it
substanc
approxim the egg is laid at the begin of juli and hatch out
some seven or eight week later dure the period of incub which
duti is share by all male and femal alik the egg is held in a loos
fold of skin at the lower part of the abdomen the skin of the adult
be worn bare of feather in thi region
when hatch out the chick is covet by everi unoccupi adult and so
desper at time ar the struggl for it possess that veri
frequent it get injur or kill by it wouldb foster parent dr
wilson ha estim the mortal among the chick befor thei shed
their down at 77 per cent and think that half thi number ar kill
by kind veri often in fact thei will crawl under project
ledg of ic or anywher to escap the attent of half a dozen or
so of adult all bear down upon them togeth onli to meet and
struggl for their possess dure which process the innoc caus
mai get trampl and claw to death so strong is the matern instinct
of the emperor that frozen and lifeless chick ar carri about and
nurs until their down is worn awai in fact the scientist who
visit the rookeri were unabl to get good specimen of dead chick as
all of these had been treat in thi wai
fortun the emperor chick escap the depred of the skua gull
which plai such havoc in the adli rookeri becaus the skua doe
not come south until the summer by which time the emperor chick ar
well grown as in the case of the adli the black throat is not
acquir until the second moult when thi ha taken place the bird
look remark handsom the bill which is curv and taper is
bluish black but the posterior half of the mandibl is colour a
beauti lilac the head and throat ar black whilst on each side of
the neck is a patch of vivid orang feather the rest of the bodi is
mark in the same wai as the adli
the mortal among the chick be so veri high the probabl is
that the life of the adult is long as otherwis the speci could
hardli surviv dr herbert klugh ha calcul that the emperor
penguin live for thirtyf year
evid goe to show that the young bird spend their immatur on the
packic as all those sight and collect on the pack at ani distanc
to the northward have been immatur and no immatur bird have been
seen along the coast at ani time dure the summer
the food of the emperor mainli consist of fish and crustacean there
ar invari mani small pebbl in the stomach like adli thei must
of cours have open water within reach in order to get food and in the
neighbourhood of cape crozier thi is alwai to be found as the rapid
tide there keep the sea from freez in over a consider area so
that probabl thei never have to walk more than a mile or two to get
food
the cry of the emperor is veri loud and travel far across the ic when
sledg over the seaic in the spring in the neighbourhood of cape
adar a curiou sound wa heard at time remind on strongli of the
overton note of a ship steam horn the sound puzzl us at the
time but i think now that most probabl thei were made by emperor
penguin
the egg of the emperor is white pyriform in shape and weigh just
under 1 lb
my own experi of these bird be limit i do not intend to enter
deepli into the subject the onli surviv member of the band who
visit cape crozier dure the winter is mr cherrygarrard and it is
much to be hope that some dai he will write us an account of what he
