biograph note
two year befor the mast were but an episod in the life of richard
henri dana jr yet the narr in which he detail the experi
of that period is perhap hi chief claim to a wide remembr hi
servic in other than literari field occupi the greater part of hi
life but thei brought him compar small recognit and mani
disappoint hi happiest associ were literari hi
pleasantest acquaintanceship those which aros through hi fame as the
author of on book the stori of hi life is on of honest and
compet effort of sincer purpos of mani thwart hope the
tradit of hi famili forc him into a profess for which he wa
intellectu but not temperament fit he should have been a
scholar teacher and author instead he becam a lawyer
born in cambridg mass august 1 1815 richard henri dana jr came
of a line of coloni ancestor whose legal understand and patriot
zeal had won them distinct hi father if possess of less vigor
than hi predecessor wa yet a man of cultur and abil he wa
wide known as poet critic and lectur and endow hi son with
nativ qualiti of intellig good breed and honesti
after somewhat vari and troublou school dai young dana enter
harvard univers where he took high rank in hi class and bid fair
to make a reput as a scholar but at the begin of hi third
year of colleg a sever attack of measl interrupt hi cours and
so affect hi ey as to preclud for a time at least all idea of
studi the state of the famili financ wa not such as to permit of
foreign travel in search of health accordingli prompt by necess
and by a youth love of adventur he ship as a common sailor in
the brig pilgrim bound for the california coast hi term of servic
last a trifl over two yearsfrom august 1834 to septemb 1836
the undertak wa on calcul to kill or cure fortun it had
the latter effect and upon return to hi nativ place physic
vigor but intellectu starv he reenter harvard and work
with such enthusiasm as to graduat in six month with honor
then came the question of hi life work though intens religi
he did not feel call to the ministri busi made no appeal hi
ancestor had been lawyer it seem best that he should follow where
thei had led had condit been those of todai he would natur
have drift into some field of scholarli researchpolit scienc
or histori as it wa he enter law school which in 1840 he left
to take up the practic of hi profess but dana had not the tact
the person magnet or the busi sagac to make a brilliant
success befor the bar despit the fact that he had becom a master
of legal theori an author upon intern question and a
counsellor of unimpeach integr hi progress wa painfulli slow
and toilsom involv with hi lack of tact and magnet there wa
too an admir qualiti of sturdi obstinaci that often work him
injuri though far from share the radic idea of the
abolitionist he wa ardent in hi antislaveri idea and did not
hesit to espous the unpopular doctrin of the freesoil parti of
1848 or to labor for the freedom of those boston negro who under
the fugit slave law of 1850 were in danger of deport to the
south
hi activ in the latter direct result in pecuniari loss social
ostrac and wors for upon on occas he wa set upon and nearli
kill by a pair of thug but dana wa not a man to be swerv from
hi purpos by consider of polici or of person safeti he met
hi problem as thei came to him took the cours which he believ to
be right and then stuck to it with indomit tenac yet
curious enough with none of the characterist of the politician
he long for polit prefer at the hand of the peopl thi
came to him in smallest measur onli though at on time a member of
the massachusett legislatur he wa defeat as candid for the
lower hous of congress and in 1876 suffer the bitterest
disappoint of hi life when the libel attack of enemi
prevent the ratif of hi nomin as minist to england
previou to thi he had serv hi countri as unit state district
attornei dure the civil war a time when the offic demand the
highest type of abil and upright that the govern
appreci thi wa shown in 1867 by it choic of dana as on of it
counsel in the prosecut of jefferson davi for treason the
posit of legal repres befor the halifax tribun of 1877
which met to discuss fisheri question at issu between the unit
state and canada wa given him no doubt in part becaus of hi
emin fit in part as balm for the wound of the preced year
but whatev satisfact he mai have found in such honor as time and
ripen year brought to him hi chief joi and relax lai in
travel when worri and overwork began to tell upon him he would betak
himself to shore or mountain upon sever occas he visit
europ and in 1859 made a tour of the world at length in 1876 he
gave up activ life and took resid abroad with the idea of find
leisur for the prepar of a treatis on intern law he wa
still engag in collect hi materi when on januari 6 1882
death overtook him he wa buri in rome in the protest cemeteri
whose cypress cast their long shadow over the grave of mani
distinguish foreign who have sought a last refug of health and
peac under the ski of itali
such a career as hi would seem far enough from be a failur yet
in retir dana look back upon it not without regret as a
lawyer he had felt a justifi desir to see hi labor crown by
hi elev to the bench as an activ particip in public affair
he had felt that hi servic and talent render him deserv of a
seat in congress lack these thing he might have hope that the
practic of hi profess would yield him a fortun here again he
wa disappoint in seek the fulfil of hi ambit he wa
alwai on the high road to success he never quit arriv
it is remark that have written on success book dana did not
seek further reward as a man of letter two year befor the mast
appear in 1840 while it author wa still a law student though at
the time it creat no great stir in the unit state it wa most
favor receiv in england where it pave the wai for mani pleasant
and valuabl acquaintanceship the follow year dana produc a
small volum on seamanship entitl the seaman friend thi and a
short account of a trip to cuba in 1859 constitut the sole addit
to hi earli ventur he wa a copiou letterwrit and kept full
journal of hi variou travel but he never elabor them for
public yet long befor hi death he had seen the narr of
hi sailor dai recogn as an american classic time ha not

prefac
i am unwil to present thi narr to the public without a few
word in explan of my reason for publish it sinc mr
cooper pilot and red rover there have been so mani stori of
sealif written that i should realli think it unjustifi in me to
add on to the number without be abl to give reason in some
measur warrant me in so do
with the singl except as i am quit confid of mr amess
entertain but hasti and desultori work call marin
sketch all the book profess to give life at sea have been
written by person who have gain their experi as naval offic
or passeng and of these there ar veri few which ar intend to
be taken as narr of fact
now in the first place the whole cours of life and daili duti
the disciplin habit and custom of a manofwar ar veri differ
from those of the merchant servic and in the next place howev
entertain and well written these book mai be and howev
accur thei mai give sealif as it appear to their author it
must still be plain to everi on that a naval offic who goe to sea
as a gentleman with hi glove on as the phrase is and who
associ onli with hi fellowoffic and hardli speak to a sailor
except through a boatswain mate must take a veri differ view of
the whole matter from that which would be taken by a common sailor
besid the interest which everi on must feel in exhibit of life
in those form in which he himself ha never experienc it there ha
been of late year a great deal of attent direct toward common
seamen and a strong sympathi awaken in their behalf yet i believ
that with the singl except which i have mention there ha not
been a book written profess to give their life and experi by
on who ha been of them and can know what their life realli is a
voic from the forecastl ha hardli yet been heard
in the follow page i design to give an accur and authent
narr of a littl more than two year spent as a common sailor
befor the mast in the american merchant servic it is written out
from a journal which i kept at the time and from note which i made of
most of the event as thei happen and in it i have adher close
to fact in everi particular and endeavor to give each thing it true
charact in so do i have been oblig occasion to us strong
and coars express and in some instanc to give scene which mai
be pain to nice feel but i have veri carefulli avoid do
so whenev i have not felt them essenti to give the true
charact of a scene my design is and it is thi which ha induc me
to publish the book to present the life of a common sailor at sea as
it realli isth light and the dark togeth
there mai be in some part a good deal that is unintellig to the
gener reader but i have found from my own experi and from what
i have heard from other that plain matter of fact in relat to
custom and habit of life new to us and descript of life under
new aspect act upon the inexperienc through the imagin so
that we ar hardli awar of our want of technic knowledg thousand
read the escap of the american frigat through the british channel
and the chase and wreck of the bristol trader in the red rover and
follow the minut nautic manoeuvr with breathless interest who do
not know the name of a rope in the ship and perhap with none the less
admir and enthusiasm for their want of acquaint with the
profession detail
in prepar thi narr i have carefulli avoid incorpor into
it ani impress but those made upon me by the event as thei
occur leav to my conclud chapter to which i shall
respectfulli call the reader attent those view which have been
suggest to me by subsequ reflect
these reason and the advic of a few friend have led me to give
thi narr to the press if it shall interest the gener reader
and call more attent to the welfar of seamen or give ani
inform as to their real condit which mai serv to rais them
in the rank of be and to promot in ani measur their religi
and moral improv and diminish the hardship of their daili life
the end of it public will be answer

departur
the fourteenth of august wa the dai fix upon for the sail of the
brig pilgrim on her voyag from boston round cape horn to the western
coast of north america as she wa to get under weigh earli in the
afternoon i made my appear on board at twelv oclock in full
searig and with my chest contain an outfit for a two or three
year voyag which i had undertaken from a determin to cure if
possibl by an entir chang of life and by a long absenc from book
and studi a weak of the ey which had oblig me to give up my
pursuit and which no medic aid seem like to cure
the chang from the tight dress coat silk cap and kid glove of an
undergradu at cambridg to the loos duck trowser check shirt
and tarpaulin hat of a sailor though somewhat of a transform wa
soon made and i suppos that i should pass veri well for a jack tar
but it is imposs to deceiv the practis ey in these matter and
while i suppos myself to be look as salt as neptun himself i
wa no doubt known for a landsman by everi on on board as soon as i
hove in sight a sailor ha a peculiar cut to hi cloth and a wai
of wear them which a green hand can never get the trowser tight
round the hip and thenc hang long and loos round the feet a
superabund of check shirt a lowcrown well varnish black
hat worn on the back of the head with half a fathom of black ribbon
hang over the left ey and a peculiar tie to the black silk
neckerchief with sundri other minutia ar sign the want of which
betrai the beginn at onc besid the point in my dress which were
out of the wai doubtless my complexion and hand were enough to
distinguish me from the regular salt who with a sunburnt cheek wide
step and roll gait swing hi bronz and toughen hand
athwartship half open as though just readi to grasp a rope
with all my imperfect on my head i join the crew and we
haul out into the stream and came to anchor for the night the next
dai we were emploi in prepar for sea reev studdingsail
gear cross royal yard put on chafe gear and take on
board our powder on the follow night i stood my first watch i
remain awak nearli all the first part of the night from fear that i
might not hear when i wa call and when i went on deck so great
were my idea of the import of my trust that i walk regularli
fore and aft the whole length of the vessel look out over the bow
and taffrail at each turn and wa not a littl surpris at the
cool of the old salt whom i call to take my place in stow
himself snugli awai under the long boat for a nap that wa
suffici lookout he thought for a fine night at anchor in a safe
harbor
the next morn wa saturdai and a breez have sprung up from the
southward we took a pilot on board hove up our anchor and began
beat down the bai i took leav of those of my friend who came to
see me off and had bare opportun to take a last look at the citi
and wellknown object as no time is allow on board ship for
sentiment as we drew down into the lower harbor we found the wind
ahead in the bai and were oblig to come to anchor in the road we
remain there through the dai and a part of the night my watch began
at eleven oclock at night and i receiv order to call the captain
if the wind came out from the westward about midnight the wind becam
fair and have call the captain i wa order to call all hand
how i accomplish thi i do not know but i am quit sure i did not
give the true hoars boatswain call of aall haaand up anchor
ahooi in a short time everi on wa in motion the sail loos
the yard brace and we began to heav up the anchor which wa our
last hold upon yanke land i could take but littl part in all these
prepar my littl knowledg of a vessel wa all at fault
unintellig order were so rapidli given and so immedi
execut there wa such a hurri about and such an intermingl of
strang cri and stranger action that i wa complet bewild
there is not so helpless and pitiabl an object in the world as a
landsman begin a sailor life at length those peculiar
longdrawn sound which denot that the crew ar heav the windlass
began and in a few moment we were under weigh the nois of the
water thrown from the bow began to be heard the vessel lean over
from the damp night breez and roll with the heavi ground swell and
we had actual begun our long long journei thi wa liter
bid good night to my nativ land
chapter ii
first impressionssail ho
the first dai we pass at sea wa the sabbath as we were just from
port and there wa a great deal to be done on board we were kept at
work all dai and at night the watch were set and everyth put
into sea order when we were call aft to be divid into watch i
had a good specimen of the manner of a sea captain after the divis
had been made he gave a short characterist speech walk the
quarter deck with a cigar in hi mouth and drop the word out
between the puff
now my men we have begun a long voyag if we get along well
togeth we shall have a comfort time if we dont we shall have
hell afloatal youv got to do is to obei your order and do your
duti like menthen youll fare well enoughif you dont youll
fare hard enoughi can tell you if we pull togeth youll find me
a clever fellow if we dont youll find me a bloodi rascalthat
all iv got to saygo below the larboard watch
i be in the starboard or second mate watch had the opportun of
keep the first watch at sea s a young man make like
myself hi first voyag wa in the same watch and as he wa the son
of a profession man and had been in a countingroom in boston we
found that we had mani friend and topic in common we talk these
matter overboston what our friend were probabl do our
voyag etc until he went to take hi turn at the lookout and left
me to myself i had now a fine time for reflect i felt for the
first time the perfect silenc of the sea the offic wa walk the
quarter deck where i had no right to go on or two men were talk
on the forecastl whom i had littl inclin to join so that i wa
left open to the full impress of everyth about me howev much i
wa affect by the beauti of the sea the bright star and the cloud
driven swiftli over them i could not but rememb that i wa
separ myself from all the social and intellectu enjoy of
life yet strang as it mai seem i did then and afterward take
pleasur in these reflect hope by them to prevent my becom
insens to the valu of what i wa leav
but all my dream were soon put to flight by an order from the offic
to trim the yard as the wind wa get ahead and i could plainli
see by the look the sailor occasion cast to windward and by the
dark cloud that were fast come up that we had bad weather to
prepar for and had heard the captain sai that he expect to be in
the gulf stream by twelv oclock in a few minut eight bell were
struck the watch call and we went below i now began to feel the
first discomfort of a sailor life the steerag in which i live wa
fill with coil of rig spare sail old junk and ship store
which had not been stow awai moreov there had been no berth
built for us to sleep in and we were not allow to drive nail to
hang our cloth upon the sea too had risen the vessel wa roll
heavili and everyth wa pitch about in grand confus there
wa a complet hurrah nest as the sailor sai everyth on top
and noth at hand a larg hawser had been coil awai upon my
chest my hat boot mattress and blanket had all fetch awai and
gone over to leeward and were jam and broken under the box and
coil of rig to crown all we were allow no light to find
anyth with and i wa just begin to feel strong symptom of
seasick and that listless and inact which accompani it
give up all attempt to collect my thing togeth i lai down upon
the sail expect everi moment to hear the cry of all hand ahoi
which the approach storm would soon make necessari i shortli heard
the raindrop fall on deck thick and fast and the watch evid
had their hand full of work for i could hear the loud and repeat
order of the mate the trampl of feet the creak of block and
all the accompani of a come storm in a few minut the slide
of the hatch wa thrown back which let down the nois and tumult of
the deck still louder the loud cry of all hand ahoi tumbl up here
and take in sail salut our ear and the hatch wa quickli shut
again when i got upon deck a new scene and a new experi were
befor me the littl brig wa close haul upon the wind and ly
over as it then seem to me nearli upon her beam end the heavi
head sea wa beat against her bow with the nois and forc almost
of a sledgehamm and fly over the deck drench us complet
through the topsail halyard had been let go and the great sail
fill out and back against the mast with a nois like thunder
the wind wa whistl through the rig loos rope fly about
loud and to me unintellig order constantli given and rapidli
execut and the sailor sing out at the rope in their hoars
and peculiar strain in addit to all thi i had not got my sea
leg on wa dreadfulli sick with hardli strength enough to hold on
to anyth and it wa pitch dark thi wa my state when i wa
order aloft for the first time to reef topsail
how i got along i cannot now rememb i laid out on the yard and
held on with all my strength i could not have been of much servic
for i rememb have been sick sever time befor i left the topsail
yard soon all wa snug aloft and we were again allow to go below
thi i did not consid much of a favor for the confus of
everyth below and that inexpress sicken smell caus by the
shake up of the bilgewat in the hold made the steerag but an
indiffer refug from the cold wet deck i had often read of the
nautic experi of other but i felt as though there could be
none wors than mine for in addit to everi other evil i could not
but rememb that thi wa onli the first night of a two year voyag
when we were on deck we were not much better off for we were
continu order about by the offic who said that it wa good for
us to be in motion yet anyth wa better than the horribl state of
thing below i rememb veri well go to the hatchwai and put my
head down when i wa oppress by nausea and alwai be reliev
immedi it wa as good as an emet
thi state of thing continu for two dai
wednesdai aug 20th we had the watch on deck from four till eight
thi morn when we came on deck at four oclock we found thing
much chang for the better the sea and wind had gone down and the
star were out bright i experienc a correspond chang in my
feel yet continu extrem weak from my sick i stood in
the waist on the weather side watch the gradual break of the
dai and the first streak of the earli light much ha been said of
the sunris at sea but it will not compar with the sunris on
shore it want the accompani of the song of bird the awaken
hum of men and the glanc of the first beam upon tree hill
spire and housetop to give it life and spirit but though the
actual rise of the sun at sea is not so beauti yet noth will
compar with the earli break of dai upon the wide ocean
there is someth in the first grei streak stretch along the
eastern horizon and throw an indistinct light upon the face of the
deep which combin with the boundless and unknown depth of the
sea around you and give on a feel of loneli of dread and of
melancholi forebod which noth els in natur can give thi
gradual pass awai as the light grow brighter and when the sun
come up the ordinari monoton sea dai begin
from such reflect as these i wa arous by the order from the
offic forward there rig the headpump i found that no time wa
allow for daydream but that we must turnto at the first
light have call up the idler name carpent cook steward

tell him that i had rather wait till after breakfast but i knew that i
must take the bull by the horn and that if i show ani sign of
want of spirit or of backward that i should be ruin at onc so
i took my bucket of greas and climb up to the royalmasthead here
the rock of the vessel which increas the higher you go from the
foot of the mast which is the fulcrum of the lever and the smell of
the greas which offend my fastidi sens upset my stomach
again and i wa not a littl rejoic when i got upon the compar
terra firma of the deck in a few minut seven bell were struck the
log hove the watch call and we went to breakfast here i cannot but
rememb the advic of the cook a simpleheart african now sai

biscuit or two produc in me i wa a new be we had a watch
below until noon so that i had some time to myself and get a huge
piec of strong cold salt beef from the cook i kept gnaw upon it
until twelv oclock when we went on deck i felt somewhat like a man
and could begin to learn my sea duti with consider spirit at
about two oclock we heard the loud cry of sail ho from aloft and
soon saw two sail to windward go directli athwart our haws thi
wa the first time that i had seen a sail at sea i thought then and
alwai have sinc that it exce everi other sight in interest and
beauti thei pass to leeward of us and out of hail distanc but
the captain could read the name on their stern with the glass thei
were the ship helen mar of new york and the brig mermaid of boston
thei were both steer westward and were bound in for our dear
nativ land
thursdai aug 21st thi dai the sun rose clear we had a fine wind
and everyth wa bright and cheer i had now got my sea leg on
and wa begin to enter upon the regular duti of a sealif
about six bell that is three oclock pm we saw a sail on our
larboard bow i wa veri anxiou like everi new sailor to speak her
she came down to us back her maintopsail and the two vessel
stood head on bow and curvet at each other like a coupl of
warhors rein in by their rider it wa the first vessel that i
had seen near and i wa surpris to find how much she roll and
pitch in so quiet a sea she lung her head into the sea and then
her stern settl gradual down her huge bow rose up show the
bright copper and her stern and bresthook drip like old
neptun lock with the brine her deck were fill with passeng

first in french but receiv no answer she tri us in english she
wa the ship la carolina from havr for new york we desir her to
report the brig pilgrim from boston for the northwest coast of
america five dai out she then fill awai and left us to plough on
through our wast of water thi dai end pleasantli we had got
into regular and comfort weather and into that routin of sealif
which is onli broken by a storm a sail or the sight of land
chapter iii
ship dutiestrop
as we had now a long spell of fine weather without ani incid to
break the monotoni of our live there can be no better place to
describ the duti regul and custom of an american
merchantman of which our wa a fair specimen
the captain in the first place is lord paramount he stand no
watch come and goe when he pleas and is account to no on
and must be obei in everyth without a question even from hi
chief offic he ha the power to turn hi offic off duti and even
to break them and make them do duti as sailor in the forecastl when
there ar no passeng and no supercargo as in our vessel he ha no
companion but hi own digniti and no pleasur unless he differ from
most of hi kind but the conscious of possess suprem power
and occasion the exercis of it
the prime minist the offici organ and the activ and
superintend offic is the chief mate he is first lieuten
boatswain sailingmast and quartermast the captain tell him
what he wish to have done and leav to him the care of overse
of allot the work and also the respons of it be well
done the mate as he is alwai call par excel also keep the
logbook for which he is respons to the owner and insur and
ha the charg of the stowag safe keep and deliveri of the cargo
he is also exofficio the wit of the crew for the captain doe not
condescend to joke with the men and the second mate no on care for
so that when the mate think fit to entertain the peopl with a
coars joke or a littl practic wit everi on feel bound to laugh
the second mate is proverbi a dog berth he is neither offic
nor man the men do not respect him as an offic and he is oblig
to go aloft to reef and furl the topsail and to put hi hand into
the tar and slush with the rest the crew call him the sailor
waiter as he ha to furnish them with spunyarn marlin and all
other stuff that thei need in their work and ha charg of the
boatswain locker which includ servingboard marlinespik etc
he is expect by the captain to maintain hi digniti and to enforc
obedi and still is kept at a great distanc from the mate and
oblig to work with the crew he is on to whom littl is given and
of whom much is requir hi wage ar usual doubl those of a
common sailor and he eat and sleep in the cabin but he is oblig
to be on deck nearli all the time and eat at the second tabl that
is make a meal out of what the captain and chief mate leav
the steward is the captain servant and ha charg of the pantri
from which everi on even the mate himself is exclud these
distinct usual find him an enemi in the mate who doe not like
to have ani on on board who is not entir under hi control the
crew do not consid him as on of their number so he is left to the
merci of the captain
the cook is the patron of the crew and those who ar in hi favor can
get their wet mitten and stock dri or light their pipe at the
gallei on the night watch these two worthi togeth with the
carpent and sailmak if there be on stand no watch but be
emploi all dai ar allow to sleep in at night unless all hand
ar call
the crew ar divid into two divis as equal as mai be call
the watch of these the chief mate command the larboard and the
second mate the starboard thei divid the time between them be on
and off duti or as it is call on deck and below everi other four
hour if for instanc the chief mate with the larboard watch have
the first nightwatch from eight to twelv at the end of the four
hour the starboard watch is call and the second mate take the
deck while the larboard watch and the first mate go below until four
in the morn when thei come on deck again and remain until eight
have what is call the morn watch as thei will have been on
deck eight hour out of the twelv while those who had the middl
watchfrom twelv to four will onli have been up four hour thei
have what is call a forenoon watch below that is from eight
am till twelv m in a manofwar and in some merchantmen thi
alter of watch is kept up throughout the twentyfour hour but
our ship like most merchantmen had all hand from twelv oclock
till dark except in bad weather when we had watch and watch
an explan of the dog watch mai perhap be of us to on who
ha never been at sea thei ar to shift the watch each night so
that the same watch need not be on deck at the same hour in order to
effect thi the watch from four to eight pm is divid into two
half or dog watch on from four to six and the other from six to
eight by thi mean thei divid the twentyfour hour into seven
watch instead of six and thu shift the hour everi night as the
dog watch come dure twilight after the dai work is done and
befor the night watch is set thei ar the watch in which everybodi
is on deck the captain is up walk on the weather side of the
quarterdeck the chief mate is on the lee side and the second mate
about the weather gangwai the steward ha finish hi work in the
cabin and ha come up to smoke hi pipe with the cook in the gallei
the crew ar sit on the windlass or ly on the forecastl
smoke sing or tell long yarn at eight oclock eight bell
ar struck the log is hove the watch set the wheel reliev the
gallei shut up and the other watch goe below
the morn commenc with the watch on deck turningto at
daybreak and wash down scrub and swab the deck thi
togeth with fill the scuttl butt with fresh water and coil
up the rig usual occupi the time until seven bell half
after seven when all hand get breakfast at eight the dai work
begin and last until sundown with the except of an hour for
dinner
befor i end my explan it mai be well to defin a dai work
and to correct a mistak preval among landsmen about a sailor
life noth is more common than to hear peopl sayar not sailor
veri idl at seawhat can thei find to do thi is a veri natur
mistak and be veri frequent made it is on which everi sailor
feel interest in have correct in the first place then the
disciplin of the ship requir everi man to be at work upon someth
when he is on deck except at night and on sundai except at these
time you will never see a man on board a wellord vessel
stand idl on deck sit down or lean over the side it is
the offic duti to keep everi on at work even if there is noth
to be done but to scrape the rust from the chain cabl in no state
prison ar the convict more regularli set to work and more close
watch no convers is allow among the crew at their duti and
though thei frequent do talk when aloft or when near on anoth
yet thei alwai stop when an offic is nigh
with regard to the work upon which the men ar put it is a matter
which probabl would not be understood by on who ha not been at sea
when i first left port and found that we were kept regularli emploi
for a week or two i suppos that we were get the vessel into sea
trim and that it would soon be over and we should have noth to do
but sail the ship but i found that it continu so for two year and
at the end of the two year there wa as much to be done as ever as
ha often been said a ship is like a ladi watch alwai out of
repair when first leav port studdingsail gear is to be rove all
the run rig to be examin that which is unfit for us to be
got down and new rig rove in it place then the stand rig
is to be overhaul replac and repair in a thousand differ
wai and wherev ani of the numberless rope or the yard ar chafe
or wear upon it there chafe gear as it is call must be put
on thi chafe gear consist of worm parcel round
batten and servic of all kindsboth ropeyarn spunyarn marlin
and seizingstuff take off put on and mend the chafe
gear alon upon a vessel would find constant employ for two or
three men dure work hour for a whole voyag
the next point to be consid is that all the small stuff which
ar us on board a shipsuch as spunyarn marlin seizingstuff
etcar made on board the owner of a vessel bui up incred
quantiti of old junk which the sailor unlai after draw out
the yarn knot them togeth and roll them up in ball these
ropeyarn ar constantli us for variou purpos but the greater
part is manufactur into spunyarn for thi purpos everi vessel is
furnish with a spunyarn winch which is veri simpl consist of
a wheel and spindl thi mai be heard constantli go on deck in
pleasant weather and we had employ dure a great part of the
time for three hand in draw and knot yarn and make them
spunyarn
anoth method of emploi the crew is set up rig whenev
ani of the stand rig becom slack which is continu
happen the seiz and cover must be taken off tackl got
up and after the rig is bows well taut the seiz and
cover replac which is a veri nice piec of work there is also
such a connect between differ part of a vessel that on rope
can seldom be touch without alter anoth you cannot stai a mast
aft by the back stai without slack up the head stai etc if we
add to thi all the tar greas oil varnish paint
scrape and scrub which is requir in the cours of a long
voyag and also rememb thi is all to be done in addit to
watch at night steer reef furl brace make and
set sail and pull haul and climb in everi direct
on will hardli ask what can a sailor find to do at sea
if after all thi laboraft expos their live and limb in
storm wet and cold
wherein the cubdrawn bear would couch
the lion and the bellypinch wolf
keep their fur dry
the merchant and captain think that thei have not earn their twelv
dollar a month out of which thei cloth themselv and their salt
beef and hard bread thei keep them pick oakumad infinitum thi
is the usual resourc upon a raini dai for then it will not do to work
upon rig and when it is pour down in flood instead of let
the sailor stand about in shelter place and talk and keep
themselv comfort thei ar separ to differ part of the
ship and kept at work pick oakum i have seen oakum stuff place
about in differ part of the ship so that the sailor might not be
idl in the snatch between the frequent squall upon cross the
equat some offic have been so driven to find work for the crew
in a ship readi for sea that thei have set them to pound the
anchor often done and scrape the chain cabl the philadelphia
catech is
six dai shalt thou labor and do all thou art abl
and on the seventhholyston the deck and scrape the cabl
thi kind of work of cours is not kept up off cape horn cape of
good hope and in extrem north and south latitud but i have seen
the deck wash down and scrub when the water would have frozen if
it had been fresh and all hand kept at work upon the rig when we
had on our peajacket and our hand so numb that we could hardli hold
our marlinespik
i have here gone out of my narr cours in order that ani who read
thi mai form as correct an idea of a sailor life and duti as
possibl i have done it in thi place becaus for some time our
life wa noth but the unvari repetit of these duti which
can be better describ togeth befor leav thi descript
howev i would state in order to show landsmen how littl thei know
of the natur of a ship that a shipcarpent is kept in constant
emploi dure good weather on board vessel which ar in what is
call perfect sea order

our stern report herself as fortynin dai from bueno ayr bound
to liverpool befor she had pass us sail ho wa cri again
and we made anoth sail far on our weather bow and steer athwart
our haws she pass out of hail but we made her out to be an
hermaphrodit brig with brazilian color in her main rig by her
cours she must have been bound from brazil to the south of europ
probabl portug
sundai sept 7th fell in with the northeast trade wind thi
morn we caught our first dolphin which i wa veri eager to see i
wa disappoint in the color of thi fish when dy thei were
certainli veri beauti but not equal to what ha been said of them
thei ar too indistinct to do the fish justic there is noth more
beauti than the dolphin when swim a few feet below the surfac
on a bright dai it is the most elegantli form and also the
quickest fish in salt water and the rai of the sun strike upon it
in it rapid and chang motion reflect from the water make it
look like a strai beam from a rainbow
thi dai wa spent like all pleasant sabbath at sea the deck ar

throughout the dai onli on watch is kept on deck at a time the men
ar all dress in their best white duck trowser and red or check

captain ha made friend of hi crew by allow them duff twice a week
on the passag home
on board some vessel thi is made a dai of instruct and of

the smallest boi and a dai of rest and of someth like quiet
social enjoy wa all that we could expect
we continu run larg befor the northeast trade wind for
sever dai until mondai
septemb 22d when upon come on deck at seven bell in the morn
we found the other watch aloft throw water upon the sail and
look astern we saw a small clipperbuilt brig with a black hull
head directli after us we went to work immedi and put all
the canva upon the brig which we could get upon her rig out oar
for studdingsail yard and continu wet down the sail by
bucket of water whip up to the masthead until about nine oclock
when there came on a drizzl rain the vessel continu in pursuit
chang her cours as we chang our to keep befor the wind the
captain who watch her with hi glass said that she wa arm and
full of men and show no color we continu run dead befor
the wind know that we sail better so and that clipper ar
fastest on the wind we had also anoth advantag the wind wa
light and we spread more canva than she did have royal and
skysail fore and aft and ten studdingsail while she be an
hermaphrodit brig had onli a gaff topsail aft earli in the morn
she wa overhaul us a littl but after the rain came on and the
wind grew lighter we began to leav her astern all hand remain on
deck throughout the dai and we got our arm in order but we were too
few to have done anyth with her if she had prove to be what we
fear fortun there wa no moon and the night which follow wa
exceedingli dark so that by put out all the light and alter
our cours four point we hope to get out of her reach we had no
light in the binnacl but steer by the star and kept perfect
silenc through the night at daybreak there wa no sign of anyth
in the horizon and we kept the vessel off to her cours
wednesdai octob 1st cross the equat in long 24 24 w i now
for the first time felt at liberti accord to the old usag to
call myself a son of neptun and wa veri glad to be abl to claim the
titl without the disagre initi which so mani have to go
through after onc cross the line you can never be subject to
the process but ar consid as a son of neptun with full power
to plai trick upon other thi ancient custom is now seldom allow
unless there ar passeng on board in which case there is alwai a
good deal of sport
it had been obviou to all hand for some time that the second mate
whose name wa f wa an idl careless fellow and not much of a
sailor and that the captain wa exceedingli dissatisfi with him the
power of the captain in these case wa well known and we all
anticip a difficulti f call mr by virtu of hi offic
wa but half a sailor have alwai been short voyag and remain at
home a long time between them hi father wa a man of some properti
and intend to have given hi son a liber educ but he be
idl and worthless wa sent off to sea and succeed no better there
for unlik mani scamp he had none of the qualiti of a sailorh
wa not of the stuff that thei make sailor of he wa on of that
class of offic who ar dislik by their captain and despis by the
crew he us to hold long yarn with the crew and talk about the
captain and plai with the boi and relax disciplin in everi wai
thi kind of conduct alwai make the captain suspici and is never
pleasant in the end to the men thei prefer to have an offic
activ vigil and distant as mai be with kind among other
bad practic he frequent slept on hi watch and have been
discov asleep by the captain he wa told that he would be turn
off duti if he did it again to prevent it in everi wai possibl the
hencoop were order to be knock up for the captain never sat down
on deck himself and never permit an offic to do so
the second night after cross the equat we had the watch from
eight till twelv and it wa my helm for the last two hour there
had been light squall through the night and the captain told mr
f who command our watch to keep a bright lookout soon after i
came to the helm i found that he wa quit drowsi and at last he
stretch himself on the companion and went fast asleep soon
afterward the captain came veri quietli on deck and stood by me for
some time look at the compass the offic at length becam awar
of the captain presenc but pretend not to know it began hum
and whistl to himself to show that he wa not asleep and went
forward without look behind him and order the main royal to be
loos on turn round to come aft he pretend surpris at see
the master on deck thi would not do the captain wa too wide
awak for him and begin upon him at onc gave him a grand
blowup in true nautic styleyour a lazi goodfornoth
rascal your neither man boi soger nor sailor your no more than
a thing aboard a vessel you dont earn your salt your wors than a
mahon soger and other still more choic extract from the sailor
vocabulari after the poor fellow had taken the harangu he wa sent
into hi stateroom and the captain stood the rest of the watch
himself
at seven bell in the morn all hand were call aft and told that
f wa no longer an offic on board and that we might choos on
of our own number for second mate it is usual for the captain to make
thi offer and it is veri good polici for the crew think themselv
the chooser and ar flatter by it but have to obei nevertheless
our crew as is usual refus to take the respons of choos a
man of whom we would never be abl to complain and left it to the
captain he pick out an activ and intellig young sailor born
near the kennebe who had been sever canton voyag and proclaim
him in the follow manner i choos jim hallh your second mate
all youv got to do is to obei him as you would me and rememb that
he is mr hall f went forward into the forecastl as a common
sailor and lost the handl to hi name while young foremast jim
becam mr hall and took up hi quarter in the land of knive and
fork and teacup
sundai octob 5th it wa our morn watch when soon after the
dai began to break a man on the forecastl call out land ho i
had never heard the cry befor and did not know what it meant and
few would suspect what the word were when hear the strang sound
for the first time but i soon found by the direct of all ey
that there wa land stretch along our weather beam we immedi
took in studdingsail and haul our wind run in for the land
thi wa done to determin our longitud for by the captain
chronomet we were in 25 w but by hi observ we were much
farther and he had been for some time in doubt whether it wa hi
chronomet or hi sextant which wa out of order thi landfal
settl the matter and the former instrument wa condemn and
becom still wors wa never afterward us
as we ran in toward the coast we found that we were directli off the
port of pernambuco and could see with the telescop the roof of the
hous and on larg church and the town of olinda we ran along by
the mouth of the harbor and saw a fullrig brig go in at two
pm we again kept off befor the wind leav the land on our
quarter and at sundown it wa out of sight it wa here that i
first saw on of those singular thing call catamaran thei ar
compos of log lash togeth upon the water have on larg sail
ar quit fast and strang as it mai seem ar trust as good sea
boat we saw sever with from on to three men in each boldli
put out to sea after it had becom almost dark the indian go out
in them after fish and as the weather is regular in certain season
thei have no fear after take a new departur from olinda we kept
off on our wai to cape horn
we met with noth remark until we were in the latitud of the
river la plata here there ar violent gale from the southwest
call pompero which ar veri destruct to the ship in the
river and ar felt for mani leagu at sea thei ar usual preced
by lightn the captain told the mate to keep a bright lookout
and if thei saw lightn at the southwest to take in sail at onc
we got the first touch of on dure my watch on deck i wa walk in
the lee gangwai and thought that i saw lightn on the lee bow i
told the second mate who came over and look out for some time it
wa veri black in the southwest and in about ten minut we saw a
distinct flash the wind which had been southeast had now left us
and it wa dead calm we sprang aloft immedi and furl the
royal and topgallantsail and took in the fly jib haul up the
mainsail and trysail squar the after yard and await the attack
a huge mist cap with black cloud came drive toward us extend
over that quarter of the horizon and cover the star which shone
brightli in the other part of the heaven it came upon us at onc
with a blast and a shower of hail and rain which almost took our
breath from us the hardiest wa oblig to turn hi back we let the
halyard run and fortun were not taken aback the littl vessel
paid off from the wind and ran on for some time directli befor it
tear through the water with everyth fly have call all
hand we closereef the topsail and trysail furl the cours and
job set the foretopmast staysail and brought her up nearli to her
cours with the weather brace haul in a littl to eas her
thi wa the first blow that i had seen which could realli be call
a gale we had reef our topsail in the gulf stream and i thought
it someth seriou but an older sailor would have thought noth of
it as i had now becom us to the vessel and to my duti i wa of
some servic on a yard and could knot my reefpoint as well as
anybodi i obei the order to lay1 aloft with the rest and found
the reef a veri excit scene for on watch reef the
foretopsail and the other the main and everi on did hi utmost to
get hi topsail hoist first we had a great advantag over the
larboard watch becaus the chief mate never goe aloft while our new
second mate us to jump into the rig as soon as we began to haul
out the reeftackl and have the weather ear pass befor there
wa a man upon the yard in thi wai we were almost alwai abl to
rais the cry of haul out to leeward befor them and have knot
our point would slide down the shroud and backstai and sing out
at the topsail halyard to let it be known that we were ahead of them
reef is the most excit part of a sailor duti all hand ar
engag upon it and after the halyard ar let go there is no time to
be lostno soger or hang back then if on is not quick
enough anoth run over him the first on the yard goe to the
weather ear the second to the lee and the next two to the dog
ear while the other lai along into the bunt just give each other
elbowroom in reef the yardarm the extrem of the yard ar
the post of honor but in furl the strongest and most experienc
stand in the sling or middl of the yard to make up the bunt if
the second mate is a smart fellow he will never let ani on take
either of these post from him but if he is want either in
seamanship strength or activ some better man will get the bunt
and ear from him which immedi bring him into disreput
we remain for the rest of the night and throughout the next dai
under the same close sail for it continu to blow veri fresh and
though we had no more hail yet there wa a soak rain and it wa
quit cold and uncomfort the more so becaus we were not prepar
for cold weather but had on our thin cloth we were glad to get a
watch below and put on our thick cloth boot and southwest
toward sundown the gale moder a littl and it began to clear off
in the southwest we shook our reef out on by on and befor
midnight had topgal sail upon her
we had now made up our mind for cape horn and cold weather and
enter upon everi necessari prepar
tuesdai nov 4th at daybreak saw land upon our larboard quarter
there were two island of differ size but of the same shape rather
high begin low at the water edg and run with a curv
ascent to the middl thei were so far off as to be of a deep blue
color and in a few hour we sank them in the northeast these were
the falkland island we had run between them and the main land of
patagonia at sunset the second mate who wa at the masthead said
that he saw land on the starboard bow thi must have been the island
of staten land and we were now in the region of cape horn with a fine
breez from the northward topmast and topgal studdingsail set
and everi prospect of a speedi and pleasant passag round

chapter v
cape horna visit
wednesdai nov 5th the weather wa fine dure the previou night
and we had a clear view of the magellan cloud and of the southern
cross the magellan cloud consist of three small nebula in the
southern part of the heavenstwo bright like the milkywai and on
dark these ar first seen just abov the horizon soon after cross
the southern tropic when off cape horn thei ar nearli overhead the
cross is compos of four star in that form and is said to be the
brightest constel in the heaven
dure the first part of thi dai wednesdai the wind wa light but
after noon it came on fresh and we furl the royal we still kept
the studdingsail out and the captain said he should go round with
them if he could just befor eight oclock then about sundown in
that latitud the cry of all hand ahoi wa sound down the fore
scuttl and the after hatchwai and hurri upon deck we found a
larg black cloud roll on toward us from the southwest and
blacken the whole heaven here come the cape horn said the
chief mate and we had hardli time to haul down and clew up befor it
wa upon us in a few moment a heavier sea wa rais than i had
ever seen befor and as it wa directli ahead the littl brig which
wa no better than a bath machin plung into it and all the
forward part of her wa under water the sea pour in through the
bowport and hawsehol and over the knighthead threaten to wash
everyth overboard in the lee scupper it wa up to a man waist
we sprang aloft and doubl reef the topsail and furl all the
other sail and made all snug but thi would not do the brig wa
labor and strain against the head sea and the gale wa grow
wors and wors at the same time the sleet and hail were drive with
all furi against us we clew down and haul out the reeftackl
again and closereef the foretopsail and furl the main and hove
her to on the starboard tack here wa an end to our fine prospect
we made up our mind to head wind and cold weather sent down the
royal yard and unrov the gear but all the rest of the top hamper
remain aloft even to the skysail mast and studdingsail boom
throughout the night it storm violentlyrain hail snow and sleet
beat down upon the vesselth wind continu to break ahead and
the sea run high at daybreak about three am the deck wa
cover with snow the captain sent up the steward with a glass of
grog to each of the watch and all the time that we were off the cape
grog wa given to the morn watch and to all hand whenev we
reef topsail the cloud clear awai at sunris and the wind
becom more fair we again made sail and stood nearli up to our
cours
thursdai nov 6th it continu more pleasant through the first part
of the dai but at night we had the same scene over again thi time
we did not heav to as on the night befor but endeavor to beat to
windward under closereef topsail balancereef trysail and fore
topmast staysail thi night it wa my turn to steer or as the
sailor sai my trick at the helm for two hour inexperienc as i
wa i made out to steer to the satisfact of the offic and
neither s nor myself gave up our trick all the time that we were
off the cape thi wa someth to boast of for it requir a good
deal of skill and watch to steer a vessel close haul in a
gale of wind against a heavi head sea eas her when she pitch
is the word and a littl careless in let her ship a heavi sea
might sweep the deck or knock mast out of her
fridai nov 7th toward morn the wind went down and dure the
whole forenoon we lai toss about in a dead calm and in the midst of
a thick fog the calm here ar unlik those in most part of the
world for there is alwai such a high sea run and the period of
calm ar so short that it ha no time to go down and vessel be
under no command of sail or rudder lie like log upon the water we
were oblig to steadi the boom and yard by gui and brace and to
lash everyth well below we now found our top hamper of some us
for though it is liabl to be carri awai or sprung by the sudden
bring up of a vessel when pitch in a chop sea yet it is a
great help in steadi a vessel when roll in a long swell give
it more slow eas and regular to the motion
the calm of the morn remind me of a scene which i forgot to
describ at the time of it occurr but which i rememb from it
be the first time that i had heard the near breath of whale it
wa on the night that we pass between the falkland island and staten
land we had the watch from twelv to four and come upon deck
found the littl brig ly perfectli still surround by a thick fog
and the sea as smooth as though oil had been pour upon it yet now
and then a long low swell roll over it surfac slightli lift
the vessel but without break the glassi smooth of the water we
were surround far and near by shoal of sluggish whale and
grampus which the fog prevent our see rise slowli to the
surfac or perhap ly out at length heav out those peculiar
lazi deep and longdrawn breath which give such an impress of
supin and strength some of the watch were asleep and the other
were perfectli still so that there wa noth to break the illus
and i stood lean over the bulwark listen to the slow breath
of the mighti creaturesnow on break the water just alongsid
whose black bodi i almost fanci that i could see through the fog and
again anoth which i could just hear in the distanceuntil the low
and regular swell seem like the heav of the ocean mighti bosom
to the sound of it heavi and longdrawn respir
toward the even of thi dai fridai 7th the fog clear off and
we had everi appear of a cold blow and soon after sundown it came
on again it wa clew up and haul down reef and furl until we had
got her down to closereef topsail doublereef trysail and
reef forespens snow hail and sleet were drive upon us most of
the night and the sea wa break over the bow and cover the
forward part of the littl vessel but as she would lai her cours the
captain refus to heav her to
saturdai nov 8th thi dai commenc with calm and thick fog and
end with hail snow a violent wind and closereef topsail
sundai nov 9th todai the sun rose clear and continu so until
twelv oclock when the captain got an observ thi wa veri
well for cape horn and we thought it a littl remark that as we
had not had on unpleas sundai dure the whole voyag the onli
toler dai here should be a sundai we got time to clear up the
steerag and forecastl and set thing to right and to overhaul our
wet cloth a littl but thi did not last veri long between five
and sixth sun wa then nearli three hour highth cry of all
starbowlin ahoi summon our watch on deck and immedi all
hand were call a true specimen of cape horn wa come upon us a
great cloud of a dark slatecolor wa drive on us from the
southwest and we did our best to take in sail for the light sail
had been set dure the first part of the dai befor we were in the
midst of it we had got the light sail furl the cours haul up
and the topsail reeftackl haul out and were just mount the
forerig when the storm struck us in an instant the sea which
had been compar quiet wa run higher and higher and it
becam almost as dark as night the hail and sleet were harder than i
had yet felt them seem to almost pin us down to the rig we
were longer take in sail than ever befor for the sail were stiff
and wet the rope and rig cover with snow and sleet and we
ourselv cold and nearli blind with the violenc of the storm by
the time we had got down upon deck again the littl brig wa plung
madli into a tremend head sea which at everi drive rush in
through the bowport and over the bow and buri all the forward
part of the vessel at thi instant the chief mate who wa stand
on the top of the windlass at the foot of the spenser mast call
out lai out there and furl the jib thi wa no agreeabl or safe
duti yet it must be done an old swede the best sailor on board
who belong on the forecastl sprang out upon the bowsprit anoth
on must go i wa near the mate and sprang forward threw the
downhaul over the windlass and jump between the knighthead out
upon the bowsprit the crew stood abaft the windlass and haul the
jib down while we got out upon the weather side of the jibboom our
feet on the foot rope hold on by the spar the great jib fly
off to leeward and slat so as almost to throw us off of the boom
for some time we could do noth but hold on and the vessel dive
into two huge sea on after the other plung us twice into the
water up to our chin we hardli knew whether we were on or off when
come up drip from the water we were rais high into the air
john that wa the sailor name thought the boom would go everi
moment and call out to the mate to keep the vessel off and haul
down the staysail but the furi of the wind and the break of the
sea against the bow defi everi attempt to make ourselv heard and
we were oblig to do the best we could in our situat fortun
no other sea so heavi struck her and we succeed in furl the jib
after a fashion and come in over the staysail net were not
a littl pleas to find that all wa snug and the watch gone below
for we were soak through and it wa veri cold the weather
continu nearli the same through the night
mondai nov 10th dure a part of thi dai we were hove to but the
rest of the time were drive on under closereef sail with a
heavi sea a strong gale and frequent squall of hail and snow
tuesdai nov 11th the same
wednesdai nov 12th the same
thursdai nov 13th the same
we had now got harden to cape weather the vessel wa under reduc
sail and everyth secur on deck and below so that we had littl
to do but steer and to stand our watch our cloth were all wet
through and the onli chang wa from wet to more wet it wa in vain
to think of read or work below for we were too tire the
hatchwai were close down and everyth wa wet and uncomfort
black and dirti heav and pitch we had onli to come below when
the watch wa out wring out our wet cloth hang them up and turn in
and sleep as soundli as we could until the watch wa call again a
sailor can sleep anywhereno sound of wind water wood or iron can
keep him awakeand we were alwai fast asleep when three blow on the
hatchwai and the unwelcom cry of all starbowlin ahoi eight bell
there below do you hear the new the usual formula of call the
watch rous us up from our berth upon the cold wet deck the
onli time when we could be said to take ani pleasur wa at night and
morn when we were allow a tin pot full of hot tea or as the
sailor significantli call it water bewitch sweeten with
molass thi bad as it wa wa still warm and comfort and
togeth with our sea biscuit and cold salt beef made quit a meal
yet even thi meal wa attend with some uncertainti we had to go
ourselv to the gallei and take our kid of beef and tin pot of tea
and run the risk of lose them befor we could get below mani a kid
of beef have i seen roll in the scupper and the bearer ly at
hi length on the deck i rememb an english lad who wa alwai the
life of the crew but whom we afterward lost overboard stand for
nearli ten minut at the gallei with thi pot of tea in hi hand
wait for a chanc to get down into the forecastl and see what
he thought wa a smooth spell start to go forward he had just
got to the end of the windlass when a great sea broke over the bow
and for a moment i saw noth of him but hi head and shoulder and
at the next instant be taken off of hi leg he wa carri aft
with the sea until her stern lift up and send the water forward
he wa left high and dry at the side of the longboat still hold on
to hi tin pot which had now noth in it but salt water but
noth could ever daunt him or overcom for a moment hi habitu
good humor regain hi leg and shake hi fist at the man at the
wheel he roll below sai as he pass a man no sailor if he
cant take a joke the duck wa not the worst of such an affair
for as there wa an allow of tea you could get no more from the
gallei and though sailor would never suffer a man to go without but
would alwai turn in a littl from their own pot to fill up hi yet
thi wa at best but divid the loss among all hand
someth of the same kind befel me a few dai after the cook had
just made for us a mess of hot scousethat is biscuit pound fine
salt beef cut into small piec and a few potato boil up togeth
and season with pepper thi wa a rare treat and i be the last
at the gallei had it put in my charg to carri down for the mess i
got along veri well as far as the hatchwai and wa just get down
the step when a heavi sea lift the stern out of water and
pass forward drop it down again threw the step from their
place and i came down into the steerag a littl faster than i meant
to with the kid on top of me and the whole preciou mess scatter
over the floor whatev your feel mai be you must make a joke of
everyth at sea and if you were to fall from aloft and be caught in
the belli of a sail and thu save from instant death it would not do
to look at all disturb or to make a seriou matter of it
fridai nov 14th we were now well to the westward of the cape and
were chang our cours to the northward as much as we dare sinc
the strong southwest wind which prevail then carri us in toward
patagonia at two pm we saw a sail on our larboard beam and at
four we made it out to be a larg ship steer our cours under
singlereef topsail we at that time had shaken the reef out of
our topsail as the wind wa lighter and set the main topgal
sail as soon as our captain saw what sail she wa under he set the
fore topgal sail and fly jib and the old whalerfor such hi
boat and short sail show him to befelt a littl asham and shook
the reef out of hi topsail but could do no more for he had sent
down hi topgal mast off the cape he ran down for us and
answer our hail as the whaleship new england of poughkeepsi on
hundr and twenti dai from new york our captain gave our name and
ad ninetytwo dai from boston thei then had a littl convers
about longitud in which thei found that thei could not agre the
ship fell astern and continu in sight dure the night toward
morn the wind have becom light we cross our royal and skysail
yard and at daylight we were seen under a cloud of sail have royal
and skysail fore and aft the spouter as the sailor call a
whaleman had sent up hi main topgal mast and set the sail and
made signal for us to heav to about halfpast seven their whaleboat
came alongsid and captain job terri sprang on board a man known in
everi port and by everi vessel in the pacif ocean dont you know
job terri i thought everybodi knew job terri said a greenhand who
came in the boat to me when i ask him about hi captain he wa
inde a singular man he wa six feet high wore thick cowhid
boot and brown coat and trowser and except a sunburnt complexion
had not the slightest appear of a sailor yet he had been forti
year in the whale trade and as he said himself had own ship
built ship and sail ship hi boat crew were a pretti raw set
just out of the bush and as the sailor phrase is hadnt got the
hayse out of their hair captain terri convinc our captain that
our reckon wa a littl out and have spent the dai on board put
off in hi boat at sunset for hi ship which wa now six or eight
mile astern he began a yarn when he came on board which last
with but littl intermiss for four hour it wa all about himself
and the peruvian govern and the dublin frigat and lord jame
townshend and presid jackson and the ship ann mkim of baltimor
it would probabl never have come to an end had not a good breez
sprung up which sent him off to hi own vessel on of the lad who
came in hi boat a thoroughli countrifiedlook fellow seem to
care veri littl about the vessel rig or anyth els but went
round look at the live stock and lean over the pigsti and said
he wish he wa back again tend hi father pig
at eight oclock we alter our cours to the northward bound for juan
fernandez
thi dai we saw the last of the albatross which had been our
companion a great part of the time off the cape i had been
interest in the bird from descript which i had read of it and
wa not at all disappoint we caught on or two with a bait hook
which we float astern upon a shingl their long flap wing
long leg and larg stare ey give them a veri peculiar
appear thei look well on the wing but on of the finest sight
that i have ever seen wa an albatross asleep upon the water dure a
calm off cape horn when a heavi sea wa run there be no
breez the surfac of the water wa unbroken but a long heavi swell
wa roll and we saw the fellow all white directli ahead of us
asleep upon the wave with hi head under hi wing now rise on the
top of a huge billow and then fall slowli until he wa lost in the
hollow between he wa undisturb for some time until the nois of
our bow gradual approach rous him when lift hi head he
stare upon us for a moment and then spread hi wide wing and took
hi flight
chapter vi
loss of a mansuperstit
mondai nov 19th thi wa a black dai in our calendar at seven
oclock in the morn it be our watch below we were arous from
a sound sleep by the cry of all hand ahoi a man overboard thi
unwont cry sent a thrill through the heart of everi on and hurri
on deck we found the vessel hove flat aback with all her
studdingsail set for the boi who wa at the helm left it to throw
someth overboard and the carpent who wa an old sailor know
that the wind wa light put the helm down and hove her aback the
watch on deck were lower awai the quarterboat and i got on deck
just in time to heav myself into her as she wa leav the side but
it wa not until out upon the wide pacif in our littl boat that i
knew whom we had lost it wa georg ballmer a young english sailor
who wa prize by the offic as an activ lad and will seaman and
by the crew as a live hearti fellow and a good shipmat he wa
go aloft to fit a strap round the main topmasthead for ringtail
halyard and had the strap and block a coil of halyard and a
marlinespik about hi neck he fell from the starboard futtock
shroud and not know how to swim and be heavili dress with
all those thing round hi neck he probabl sank immedi we
pull astern in the direct in which he fell and though we knew
that there wa no hope of save him yet no on wish to speak of
return and we row about for nearli an hour without the hope of
do anyth but unwil to acknowledg to ourselv that we must
give him up at length we turn the boat head and made toward the
vessel
death is at all time solemn but never so much so as at sea a man
di on shore hi bodi remain with hi friend and the mourner go
about the street but when a man fall overboard at sea and is lost
there is a sudden in the event and a difficulti in realiz it
which give to it an air of aw mysteri a man di on shorey
follow hi bodi to the grave and a stone mark the spot you ar
often prepar for the event there is alwai someth which help
you to realiz it when it happen and to recal it when it ha pass
a man is shot down by your side in battl and the mangl bodi remain
an object and a real evid but at sea the man is near youat
your sidey hear hi voic and in an instant he is gone and
noth but a vacanc show hi loss then too at seato us a
home but express phrasey miss a man so much a dozen men ar
shut up togeth in a littl bark upon the wide wide sea and for
month and month see no form and hear no voic but their own and
on is taken suddenli from among them and thei miss him at everi turn
it is like lose a limb there ar no new face or new scene to fill
up the gap there is alwai an empti berth in the forecastl and on
man want when the small night watch is muster there is on less
to take the wheel and on less to lai out with you upon the yard you
miss hi form and the sound of hi voic for habit had made them
almost necessari to you and each of your sens feel the loss
all these thing make such a death peculiarli solemn and the effect of
it remain upon the crew for some time there is more kind shown
by the offic to the crew and by the crew to on anoth there is
more quiet and serious the oath and the loud laugh ar gone
the offic ar more watch and the crew go more carefulli aloft
the lost man is seldom mention or is dismiss with a sailor rude
eulogywel poor georg is gone hi cruis is up soon he knew hi
work and did hi duti and wa a good shipmat then usual follow
some allus to anoth world for sailor ar almost all believ
but their notion and opinion ar unfix and at loos end thei
saygod wont be hard upon the poor fellow and seldom get beyond
the common phrase which seem to impli that their suffer and hard
treatment here will excus them hereafterto work hard live hard
die hard and go to hell after all would be hard inde our cook a
simpleheart old african who had been through a good deal in hi
dai and wa rather serious inclin alwai go to church twice a
dai when on shore and read hi bibl on a sundai in the gallei
talk to the crew about spend their sabbath badli and told them
that thei might go as suddenli as georg had and be as littl prepar
yet a sailor life is at best but a mixtur of a littl good with
much evil and a littl pleasur with much pain the beauti is
link with the revolt the sublim with the commonplac and the
solemn with the ludicr
we had hardli return on board with our sad report befor an auction
wa held of the poor man cloth the captain had first howev
call all hand aft and ask them if thei were satisfi that
everyth had been done to save the man and if thei thought there wa
ani us in remain there longer the crew all said that it wa in
vain for the man did not know how to swim and wa veri heavili
dress so we then fill awai and kept her off to her cours
the law regul navig make the captain answer for the
effect of a sailor who di dure the voyag and it is either a law
or a univers custom establish for conveni that the captain
should immedi hold an auction of hi thing in which thei ar bid
off by the sailor and the sum which thei give ar deduct from
their wage at the end of the voyag in thi wai the troubl and risk
of keep hi thing through the voyag ar avoid and the cloth
ar usual sold for more than thei would be worth on shore
accordingli we had no sooner got the ship befor the wind than hi
chest wa brought up upon the forecastl and the sale began the
jacket and trowser in which we had seen him dress but a few dai
befor were expos and bid off while the life wa hardli out of hi
bodi and hi chest wa taken aft and us as a storechest so that
there wa noth left which could be call hi sailor have an
unwilling to wear a dead man cloth dure the same voyag and
thei seldom do so unless thei ar in absolut want
as is usual after a death mani stori were told about georg some
had heard him sai that he repent never have learn to swim and
that he knew that he should meet hi death by drown anoth said
that he never knew ani good to come of a voyag made against the will
and the deceas man ship and spent hi advanc and wa afterward
veri unwil to go but not be abl to refund wa oblig to sail
with us a boi too who had becom quit attach to him said that
georg talk to him dure most of the watch on the night befor
about hi mother and famili at home and thi wa the first time that
he had mention the subject dure the voyag
the night after thi event when i went to the gallei to get a light i
found the cook inclin to be talk so i sat down on the spar
and gave him an opportun to hold a yarn i wa the more inclin to
do so as i found that he wa full of the superstit onc more
common among seamen and which the recent death had wake up in hi
mind he talk about georg have spoken of hi friend and said
he believ few men di without have a warn of it which he
support by a great mani stori of dream and the unusu behavior
of men befor death from thi he went on to other superstit the
fly dutchman etc and talk rather mysteri have someth
evid on hi mind
at length he put hi head out of the gallei and look carefulli about
to see if ani on wa within hear and be satisfi on that
point ask me in a low tone
i sai you know what countryman e carpent be
ye said i he a german
what kind of a german said the cook
he belong to bremen said i
ar you sure o dat said he
i satisfi him on that point by sai that he could speak no languag
but the german and english
im plagui glad o dat said the cook i wa mighti fraid he wa a
fin i tell you what i been plagui civil to that man all the voyag
i ask him the reason of thi and found that he wa fulli possess
with the notion that fin ar wizard and especi have power over
wind and storm i tri to reason with him about it but he had the
best of all argument that from experi at hand and wa not to be
move he had been in a vessel at the sandwich island in which the
sailmak wa a fin and could do anyth he wa of a mind to thi
sailmak kept a junk bottl in hi berth which wa alwai just half
full of rum though he got drunk upon it nearli everi dai he had seen
him sit for hour togeth talk to thi bottl which he stood up
befor him on the tabl the same man cut hi throat in hi berth and
everybodi said he wa possess
he had heard of ship too beat up the gulf of finland against a
head wind and have a ship heav in sight astern overhaul and pass
them with as fair a wind as could blow and all studdingsail out
and find she wa from finland
oh ho said he iv seen too much of them men to want to see em
board a ship if thei cant have their own wai theyll plai the
dl with you
as i still doubt he said he would leav it to john who wa the
oldest seaman aboard and would know if anybodi did john to be
sure wa the oldest and at the same time the most ignor man in
the ship but i consent to have him call the cook state the
matter to him and john as i anticip side with the cook and
said that he himself had been in a ship where thei had a head wind for
a fortnight and the captain found out at last that on of the men
whom he had had some hard word with a short time befor wa a fin
and immedi told him if he didnt stop the head wind he would shut
him down in the fore peak and would not give him anyth to eat the
fin held out for a dai and a half when he could not stand it ani
longer and did someth or other which brought the wind round again
and thei let him up
there said the cook what do you think o dat
i told him i had no doubt it wa true and that it would have been odd
if the wind had not chang in fifteen dai fin or no fin
oh sai he go wai you think caus you been to colleg you
know better than anybodi you know better than them as as seen it
with their own ey you wait till youv been to sea as long as i
have and youll know
chapter vii
juan fernandezth pacif
we continu sail along with a fair wind and fine weather until
tuesdai nov 25th when at daylight we saw the island of juan
fernandez directli ahead rise like a deep blue cloud out of the
sea we were then probabl nearli seventi mile from it and so high
and so blue did it appear that i mistook it for a cloud rest over
the island and look for the island under it until it gradual
turn to a deader and greener color and i could mark the inequ
upon it surfac at length we could distinguish tree and rock and
by the afternoon thi beauti island lai fairli befor us and we
direct our cours to the onli harbor arriv at the entranc soon
after sundown we found a chilian manofwar brig the onli vessel
come out she hail us and an offic on board whom we suppos
to be an american advis us to run in befor night and said that
thei were bound to valparaiso we ran immedi for the anchorag
but ow to the wind which drew about the mountain and came to us
in flaw from everi point of the compass we did not come to an anchor
until nearli midnight we had a boat ahead all the time that we were
work in and those aboard were continu brace the yard about
for everi puff that struck us until about 12 oclock when we cameto
in 40 fathom water and our anchor struck bottom for the first time
sinc we left bostonon hundr and three dai we were then divid
into three watch and thu stood out the remaind of the night
i wa call on deck to stand my watch at about three in the morn
and i shall never forget the peculiar sensat which i experienc on
find myself onc more surround by land feel the night breez
come from off shore and hear the frog and cricket the
mountain seem almost to hang over us and appar from the veri
heart there came out at regular interv a loud echo sound which
affect me as hardli human we saw no light and could hardli
account for the sound until the mate who had been there befor told
us that it wa the alerta of the spanish soldier who were station
over some convict confin in cave nearli halfwai up the mountain at
the expir of my watch i went below feel not a littl anxiou
for the dai that i might see more nearli and perhap tread upon thi
romant i mai almost sai classic island
when all hand were call it wa nearli sunris and between that time
and breakfast although quit busi on board in get up watercask
etc i had a good view of the object about me the harbor wa nearli
landlock and at the head of it wa a landingplac protect by a
small breakwat of stone upon which two larg boat were haul up
with a sentri stand over them near thi wa a varieti of hut or
cottag nearli an hundr in number the best of them built of mud
and white wash but the greater part onli robinson cruso likeof
post and branch of tree the governor hous as it is call
wa the most conspicu be larg with grate window plaster
wall and roof of red tile yet like all the rest onli of on
stori near it wa a small chapel distinguish by a cross and a
long low brownlook build surround by someth like a
palisad from which an old and dingylook chilian flag wa fly
thi of cours wa dignifi by the titl of presidio a sentinel
wa station at the chapel anoth at the governor hous and a few
soldier arm with bayonet look rather rag with shoe out at
the toe were stroll about among the hous or wait at the
landingplac for our boat to come ashor
the mountain were high but not so overhang as thei appear to be
by starlight thei seem to bear off toward the centr of the
island and were green and well wood with some larg and i am
told exceedingli fertil vallei with muletrack lead to
differ part of the island
i cannot forget how my friend s and myself got the laugh of the
crew upon us for our eager to get on shore the captain have
order the quarterboat to be lower we both sprang down into the
forecastl fill our jacket pocket with tobacco to barter with the
peopl ashor and when the offic call for four hand in the
boat nearli broke our neck in our hast to be first over the side
and had the pleasur of pull ahead of the brig with a towlin for a
half an hour and come on board again to be laugh at by the crew
who had seen our manoeuvr
after breakfast the second mate wa order ashor with five hand to
fill the watercask and to my joi i wa among the number we pull
ashor with the empti cask and here again fortun favor me for the
water wa too thick and muddi to be put into the cask and the
governor had sent men up to the head of the stream to clear it out for
us which gave us nearli two hour of leisur thi leisur we
emploi in wander about among the hous and eat a littl fruit
which wa offer to us ground appl melon grape strawberri of
an enorm size and cherri abound here the latter ar said to
have been plant by lord anson the soldier were miser clad and
ask with some interest whether we had ani shoe to sell on board i
doubt veri much if thei had the mean of bui them thei were veri
eager to get tobacco for which thei gave shell fruit etc knive
also were in demand but we were forbidden by the governor to let ani
on have them as he told us that all the peopl there except the
soldier and a few offic were convict sent from valparaiso and
that it wa necessari to keep all weapon from their hand the
island it seem belong to chili and had been us by the govern
as a sort of botani bai for nearli two year and the governoran
englishman who had enter the chilian navywith a priest half a
dozen taskmast and a bodi of soldier were station there to
keep them in order thi wa no easi task and onli a few month
befor our arriv a few of them had stolen a boat at night board a
brig ly in the harbor sent the captain and crew ashor in their
boat and gone off to sea we were inform of thi and load our
arm and kept strict watch on board through the night and were care
not to let the convict get our knive from us when on shore the
worst part of the convict i found were lock up under sentri in
cave dug into the side of the mountain nearli halfwai up with
muletrack lead to them whenc thei were taken by dai and set to
work under taskmast upon build an aqueduct a wharf and other
public work while the rest live in the hous which thei put up for
themselv had their famili with them and seem to me to be the
laziest peopl on the face of the earth thei did noth but take a
paseo into the wood a paseo among the hous a paseo at the
landingplac look at us and our vessel and too lazi to speak
fast while the other were drivingor rather drivenabout at a
rapid trot in singl file with burden on their shoulder and
follow up by their taskmast with long rod in their hand and
broadbrim straw hat upon their head upon what precis ground
thi great distinct wa made i do not know and i could not veri
well know for the governor wa the onli man who spoke english upon the
island and he wa out of my walk
have fill our cask we return on board and soon after the
governor dress in a uniform like that of an american militia
offic the padr in the dress of the grei friar with hood and all
complet and the capitan with big whisker and dirti regiment
came on board to dine while at dinner a larg ship appear in the
of and soon afterward we saw a light whaleboat pull into the
harbor the ship lai off and on and a boat came alongsid of us and
put on board the captain a plain young quaker dress all in brown
the ship wa the cort whaleman of new bedford and had put in to
see if there were ani vessel from round the horn and to hear the
latest new from america thei remain aboard a short time and had a
littl talk with the crew when thei left us and pull off to their
ship which have fill awai wa soon out of sight
a small boat which came from the shore to take awai the governor and
suitea thei style themselvesbrought as a present to the crew a
larg pail of milk a few shell and a block of sandal wood the milk
which wa the first we had tast sinc leav boston we soon
despatch a piec of the sandal wood i obtain and learn that it
grew on the hill in the centr of the island i have alwai regret
that i did not bring awai other specimen of the product of the
island have afterward lost all that i had with meth piec of
sandal wood and a small flower which i pluck and brought on board in
the crown of my tarpaulin and carefulli press between the leav of
a book
about an hour befor sundown have stow our water cask we
commenc get under weigh and were not a littl while about it
for we were in thirti fathom water and in on of the gust which came
off shore had let go our other bow anchor and as the southerli wind
draw round the mountain and come off in uncertain flaw we were
continu swing round and had thu got a veri foul haws we hove
in upon our chain and after stopper and unshackl it again and
again and hoist and haul down sail we at length tip our
anchor and stood out to sea it wa bright starlight when we were
clear of the bai and the lofti island lai behind us in it still
beauti and i gave a part look and bid farewel to the most
romant spot of earth that my ey had ever seen i did then and have
ever sinc felt an attach for that island altogeth peculiar
it wa partli no doubt from it have been the first land that i had
seen sinc leav home and still more from the associ which
everi on ha connect with it in their childhood from read
robinson cruso to thi i mai add the height and romant outlin of
it mountain the beauti and fresh of it verdur and the extrem
fertil of it soil and it solitari posit in the midst of the
wide expans of the south pacif as all concur to give it it
peculiar charm
when thought of thi place have occur to me at differ time i
have endeavor to recal more particular with regard to it it is
situat in about 33 30 s and is distant a littl more than three
hundr mile from valparaiso on the coast of chili which is in the
same latitud it is about fifteen mile in length and five in
breadth the harbor in which we anchor call by lord anson
cumberland bai is the onli on in the island two small bight of land
on each side of the main bai sometim dignifi by the name of bai
be littl more than landingplac for boat the best anchorag is
at the western side of the bai where we lai at about three cabl
length from the shore in a littl more than thirti fathom water
thi harbor is open to the nne and in fact nearli from n to e
but the onli danger wind be the southwest on which side ar
the highest mountain it is consid veri safe the most remark
thing perhap about it is the fish with which it abound two of our
crew who remain on board caught in a few minut enough to last us
for sever dai and on of the men who wa a marblehead man said
that he never saw or heard of such an abund there were cod
bream silverfish and other kind whose name thei did not know or
which i have forgotten
there is an abund of the best of water upon the island small
stream run through everi vallei and leap down from the side
of the hill on stream of consider size flow through the centr
of the lawn upon which the hous ar built and furnish an easi and
abund suppli to the inhabit thi by mean of a short wooden
aqueduct wa brought quit down to our boat the convict had also
built someth in the wai of a breakwat and were to build a
landingplac for boat and good after which the chilian govern
intend to lai port charg
of the wood i can onli sai that it appear to be abund the island
in the month of novemb when we were there be in all the
fresh and beauti of spring appear cover with tree these were
chiefli aromat and the largest wa the myrtl the soil is veri
loos and rich and wherev it is broken up there spring up
immedi radish turnip ground appl and other garden fruit
goat we were told were not abund and we saw none though it wa
said we might if we had gone into the interior we saw a few bullock
wind about in the narrow track upon the side of the mountain and
the settlement wa complet overrun with dog of everi nation
kindr and degre hen and chicken were also abund and seem
to be taken good care of by the women the men appear to be the
laziest peopl upon the face of the earth and inde as far as my
observ goe there ar no peopl to whom the newlyinv yanke
word of loafer is more applic than to the spanish american
these men stood about do noth with their cloak littl better
in textur than an indian blanket but of rich color thrown over
their shoulder with an air which it is said that a spanish beggar can
alwai give to hi rag and with great polit and courtesi in
their address though with hole in their shoe and without a sou in
their pocket the onli interrupt to the monotoni of their dai
seem to be when a gust of wind drew round between the mountain and
blew off the bough which thei had place for roof to their hous
and gave them a few minut occup in run about after them
on of these gust occur while we were ashor and afford us no
littl amus at see the men look round and if thei found that
their roof had stood conclud that thei might stand too while those
who saw their blown off after utter a few spanish oath gather
their cloak over their shoulder and start off after them
howev thei were not gone long but soon return to their habitu
occup of do noth
it is perhap needless to sai that we saw noth of the interior but
all who have seen it give veri glow account of it our captain
went with the governor and a few servant upon mule over the
mountain and upon their return i heard the governor request him to
stop at the island on hi passag home and offer him a handsom sum to
bring a few deer with him from california for he said that there were
none upon the island and he wa veri desir of have it stock
a steadi though light southwesterli wind carri us well off from the
island and when i came on deck for the middl watch i could just
distinguish it from it hide a few low star in the southern horizon
though my unpract ey would hardli have known it for land at the
close of the watch a few tradewind cloud which had arisen though we
were hardli yet in their latitud shut it out from our view and the
next dai
thursdai nov 27th upon come on deck in the morn we were again
upon the wide pacif and saw no more land until we arriv upon the
western coast of the great contin of america

tar downdaili lifego aftcalifornia
as we saw neither land nor sail from the time of leav juan fernandez
until our arriv in california noth of interest occur except
our own do on board we caught the southeast trade and run
befor them for nearli three week without so much as alter a sail
or brace a yard the captain took advantag of thi fine weather to
get the vessel in order for come upon the coast the carpent wa
emploi in fit up a part of the steerag into a traderoom for
our cargo we now learn wa not to be land but to be sold by
retail from on board and thi traderoom wa built for the sampl and
the lighter good to be kept in and as a place for the gener
busi in the mean time we were emploi in work upon the
rig everyth wa set up taut the lower rig rattl down
or rather rattl up accord to the modern fashion an abund
of spunyarn and seizingstuff made and final the whole
standingrig fore and aft wa tar down thi wa my first
essai at thi latter busi and i had enough of it for nearli all
of it came upon my friend s and myself the men were need at the
other work and m the other young man who came out with us wa
laid up with the rheumat in hi feet and the boi wa rather too
young and small for the busi and as the wind were light and
regular he wa kept dure most of the daytim at the helm so that
nearli all the tar came upon us we put on short duck frock and
take a small bucket of tar and a bunch of oakum in our hand we went
aloft on at the main royalmasthead and the other at the fore and
began tar down thi is an import oper and is usual
done about onc in six month in vessel upon a long voyag it wa
done in our vessel sever time afterward but by the whole crew at
onc and finish off in a dai but at thi time as most of it came
upon two of us and we were new at the busi it took us sever
dai in thi oper thei alwai begin at the masthead and work
down tar the shroud backstai stand part of the lift the
ti runner etc and go out to the yardarm and come in tar
as thei come the lift and footrop tar the stai is more
difficult and is done by an oper which the sailor call ride
down a long piec of ropetopgallantstuddingsail halyard or
someth of the kindi taken up to the masthead from which the stai
lead and rove through a block for a girtlin or as the sailor
usual call it a gantlin with the end of thi a bowlin is taken
round the stai into which the man get with hi bucket of tar and a
bunch of oakum and the other end be fast on deck with some on to
tend it he is lower down gradual and tar the stai carefulli as
he goe there he sing aloft twixt heaven and earth and if the
rope slip break or is let go or if the bowlin slip he fall
overboard or break hi neck thi howev is a thing which never
enter into a sailor calcul he think onli of leav no
holydai place not tar for in case he should he would have to
go over the whole again or of drop no tar upon deck for then
there would be a soft word in hi ear from the mate in thi manner i
tar down all the headstai but found the rig about the
jibboom martingal and spritsail yard upon which i wa afterward
put the hardest here you have to hang on with your eyelid and tar
with your hand
thi dirti work could not last forev and on saturdai night we
finish it scrape all the spot from the deck and rail and what
wa of more import to us clean ourselv thoroughli roll up
our tarri frock and trowser and laid them awai for the next occas
and put on our clean duck cloth and had a good comfort sailor
saturdai night the next dai wa pleasant and inde we had but on
unpleas sundai dure the whole voyag and that wa off cape horn
where we could expect noth better on mondai we commenc paint
and get the vessel readi for port thi work too is done by the
crew and everi sailor who ha been long voyag is a littl of a
painter in addit to hi other accomplish we paint her
both insid and out from the truck to the water edg the outsid
is paint by lower stage over the side by rope and on those we
sat with our brush and paintpot by us and our feet half the time
in the water thi must be done of cours on a smooth dai when the
vessel doe not roll much i rememb veri well be over the side
paint in thi wai on fine afternoon our vessel go quietli
along at the rate of four or five knot and a pilotfish the sure
precursor of the shark swim alongsid of us the captain wa
lean over the rail watch him and we quietli went on with our
work in the midst of our paint on
fridai dec 19th we cross the equat for the second time i had
the feel which all have when for the first time thei find
themselv live under an entir chang of season as cross the
line under a burn sun in the midst of decemb and as i afterward
wa beat about among ic and snow on the fourth of juli
thursdai dec 25th thi dai wa christma but it brought us no
holidai the onli chang wa that we had a plum duff for dinner and
the crew quarrel with the steward becaus he did not give us our
usual allow of molass to eat with it he thought the plum would
be a substitut for the molass but we were not to be cheat out of
our right in thi wai
such ar the trifl which produc quarrel on shipboard in fact we
had been too long from port we were get tire of on anoth and
were in an irrit state both forward and aft our fresh provis
were of cours gone and the captain had stop our rice so that we
had noth but salt beef and salt pork throughout the week with the
except of a veri small duff on sundai thi ad to the
discont and a thousand littl thing daili and almost hourli

in thi midst of thi state of thing my messmat s and myself
petit the captain for leav to shift our berth from the steerag
where we had previous live into the forecastl thi to our
delight wa grant and we turn in to bunk and mess with the crew
forward we now began to feel like sailor which we never fulli did
when we were in the steerag while there howev us and activ
you mai be you ar but a mongreland sort of afterguard and ship
cousin you ar immedi under the ey of the offic cannot
danc sing plai smoke make a nois or growl ie complain or
take ani other sailor pleasur and you live with the steward who is
usual a gobetween and the crew never feel as though you were on of
them but if you live in the forecastl you ar as independ as a
woodsawy clerk nautic and ar a sailor you hear sailor
talk learn their wai their peculiar of feel as well as
speak and act and moreov pick up a great deal of curiou and
us inform in seamanship ship custom foreign countri
etc from their long yarn and equal long disput no man can be a
sailor or know what sailor ar unless he ha live in the forecastl
with themturn in and out with them eaten of their dish and drank
of their cup after i had been a week there noth would have
tempt me to go back to my old berth and never afterward even in
the worst of weather when in a close and leak forecastl off cape
horn did i for a moment wish myself in the steerag anoth thing
which you learn better in the forecastl than you can anywher els
is to make and mend cloth and thi is indispens to sailor a
larg part of their watch below thei spend at thi work and here i
learn that art which stood me in so good stead afterward
but to return to the state of the crew upon our come into the
forecastl there wa some difficulti about the unit of the
allow of bread by which we thought we were to lose a few pound
thi set us into a ferment the captain would not condescend to
explain and we went aft in a bodi with a swede the oldest and best
sailor of the crew for spokesman the recollect of the scene that
follow alwai bring up a smile especi the quarterdeck digniti
and eloqu of the captain he wa walk the weather side of the
quarterdeck and see us come aft stop short in hi walk and
with a voic and look intend to annihil us call out well
what do you want now whereupon we state our grievanc as
respectfulli as we could but he broke in upon us sai that we were
get fat and lazi didnt have enough to do and that made us find
fault thi provok us and we began to give word for word thi
would never answer he clench hi fist stamp and swore and sent
us all forward sai with oath enough interspers to send the
word homeawai with you go forward everi on of you ill haze
you ill work you up you dont have enough to do youv mistaken
your man im f t all the wai from down east iv been
through the mill ground and bolt and come out a regularbuilt
downeast johnnycak good when it hot but when it cold sour and
indigestibleand youll find me so the latter part of the harangu
i rememb well for it made a strong impress and the downeast
johnnycak becam a byword for the rest of the voyag so much for
our petit for the redress of grievanc the matter wa howev set
right for the mate after allow the captain due time to cool off
explain it to him and at night we were all call aft to hear
anoth harangu in which of cours the whole blame of the
misunderstand wa thrown upon us we ventur to hint that he would
not give us time to explain but it wouldnt do we were driven back
discomfort thu the affair blew over but the irrit caus by
it remain and we never had peac or a good understand again so
long as the captain and crew remain togeth
we continu sail along in the beauti temper climat of the
pacif the pacif well deserv it name for except in the
southern part at cape horn and in the western part near the china
and indian ocean it ha few storm and is never either extrem hot
or cold between the tropic there is a slight hazi like a thin
gauz drawn over the sun which without obstruct or obscur the
light temper the heat which come down with perpendicular fierc
in the atlant and indian tropic we sail well to the westward to
have the full advantag of the northeast trade and when we had
reach the latitud of point concept where it is usual to make the
land we were sever hundr mile to the westward of it we
immedi chang our cours due east and sail in that direct
for a number of dai at length we began to heaveto after dark for
fear of make the land at night on a coast where there ar no
lighthous and but indiffer chart and at daybreak on the morn
of
tuesdai jan 13th 1835 we made the land at point concept lat 34
32 n long 120 06 w the port of santa barbara to which we were
bound ly about sixti mile to the southward of thi point we
continu sail down the coast dure the dai and follow night
and on the next morn
jan 14th 1835 we came to anchor in the spaciou bai of santa
barbara after a voyag of on hundr and fifti dai from boston

californiaa southeast
california extend along nearli the whole of the western coast of
mexico between the gulf of california in the south and the bai of sir
franci drake on the north or between the 22d and 38th degre of
north latitud it is subdivid into two provinceslow or old
california ly between the gulf and the 32d degre of latitud or
near it the divis line run i believ between the bai of
todo santo and the port of san diego and new or upper california
the southernmost port of which is san diego in lat 32 39 and the
northernmost san francisco situat in the larg bai discov by
sir franci drake in lat 37 58 and call after him by the
english though the mexican call it yerba buena upper california ha
the seat of it govern at monterei where is also the customhous
the onli on on the coast and at which everi vessel intend to trade
on the coast must enter it cargo befor it can commenc it traffic
we were to trade upon thi coast exclus and therefor expect to
go to monterei at first but the captain order from home were to put
in at santa barbara which is the central port of the coast and wait
there for the agent who live there and transact all the busi for
the firm to which our vessel belong
the bai or as it wa commonli call the canal of santa barbara is
veri larg be form by the main land on on side between point
concept on the north and point st buena ventura on the south
which here bend in like a crescent and three larg island opposit
to it and at the distanc of twenti mile thi is just suffici to
give it the name of a bai while at the same time it is so larg and so
much expos to the southeast and northwest wind that it is littl
better than an open roadstead and the whole swell of the pacif ocean
roll in here befor a southeast and break with so heavi a surf in
the shallow water that it is highli danger to lie near to the
shore dure the southeast season that is between the month of
novemb and april
thi wind the southeast is the bane of the coast of california
between the month of novemb and april includ a part of each
which is the raini season in thi latitud you ar never safe from it
and accordingli in the port which ar open to it vessel ar
oblig dure these month to lie at anchor at a distanc of three
mile from the shore with sliprop on their cabl readi to slip
and go to sea at a moment warn the onli port which ar safe
from thi wind ar san francisco and monterei in the north and san
diego in the south
as it wa januari when we arriv and the middl of the southeast
season we accordingli came to anchor at the distanc of three mile
from the shore in eleven fathom water and bent a sliprop and buoi
to our cabl cast off the yardarm gasket from the sail and
stop them all with ropeyarn after we had done thi the boat
went ashor with the captain and return with order to the mate to
send a boat ashor for him at sundown i did not go in the first boat
and wa glad to find that there wa anoth go befor night for
after so long a voyag as our had been a few hour is long to pass in
sight and out of reach of land we spent the dai on board in the usual
avoc but as thi wa the first time we had been without the
captain we felt a littl more freedom and look about us to see what
sort of a countri we had got into and were to spend a year or two of
our live in
in the first place it wa a beauti dai and so warm that we had on
straw hat duck trowser and all the summer gear and as thi wa
midwint it spoke well for the climat and we afterward found that
the thermomet never fell to the freezingpoint throughout the winter
and that there wa veri littl differ between the season except
that dure a long period of raini and southeasterli weather thick
cloth were not uncomfort
the larg bai lai about us nearli smooth as there wa hardli a breath
of wind stir though the boat crew who went ashor told us that
the long ground swell broke into a heavi surf upon the beach there wa
onli on vessel in the porta long sharp brig of about 300 ton with
rake mast and veri squar yard and english color at her peak we
afterward learn that she wa built at guayaquil and name the
ayacucho after the place where the battl wa fought that gave peru
her independ and wa now own by a scotchman name wilson who
command her and wa engag in the trade between callao the
sandwich island and california she wa a fast sailer as we
frequent afterward perceiv and had a crew of sandwich island
on board besid thi vessel there wa no object to break the surfac
of the bai two point ran out as the horn of the crescent on of
whichth on to the westwardwa low and sandi and is that to which
vessel ar oblig to give a wide berth when run out for a
southeast the other is high bold and well wood and we were
told ha a mission upon it call st buenaventura from which the
point is name in the middl of thi crescent directli opposit the
anchor ground lie the mission and town of santa barbara on a low
flat plain but littl abov the level of the sea cover with grass
though entir without tree and surround on three side by an
amphitheatr of mountain which slant off to the distanc of fifteen
or twenti mile the mission stand a littl back of the town and is
a larg build or rather a collect of build in the centr of
which is a high tower with a belfri of five bell and the whole
be plaster make quit a show at a distanc and is the mark by
which vessel come to anchor the town li a littl nearer to the
beachabout half a mile from itand is compos of onestori hous
built of brown claysom of them plasteredwith red tile on the
roof i should judg that there were about an hundr of them and in
the midst of them stand the presidio or fort built of the same
materi and appar but littl stronger the town is certainli
fine situat with a bai in front and an amphitheatr of hill
behind the onli thing which diminish it beauti is that the hill
have no larg tree upon them thei have been all burnt by a great
fire which swept them off about a dozen year befor and thei had not
yet grown up again the fire wa describ to me by an inhabit as
have been a veri terribl and magnific sight the air of the whole
vallei wa so heat that the peopl were oblig to leav the town and
take up their quarter for sever dai upon the beach
just befor sundown the mate order a boat crew ashor and i went
as on of the number we pass under the stern of the english brig
and had a long pull ashor i shall never forget the impress which
our first land on the beach of california made upon me the sun had
just gone down it wa get duski the damp night wind wa begin
to blow and the heavi swell of the pacif wa set in and
break in loud and high comber upon the beach we lai on our oar
in the swell just outsid of the surf wait for a good chanc to
run in when a boat which had put off from the ayacucho just after us
came alongsid of us with a crew of duski sandwich island talk
and haloo in their outlandish tongu thei knew that we were
novic in thi kind of boat and wait to see us go in the second
mate howev who steer our boat determin to have the advantag
of their experi and would not go in first find at length how
matter stood thei gave a shout and take advantag of a great
comber which came swell in rear it head and lift up the
stern of our boat nearli perpendicular and again drop it in the
trough thei gave three or four long and strong pull and went in on
top of the great wave throw their oar overboard and as far from
the boat as thei could throw them and jump out the instant that the
boat touch the beach and then seiz hold of her and run her up
high and dry upon the sand we saw at onc how it wa to be done
and also the necess of keep the boat stern on to the sea for
the instant the sea should strike upon her broadsid or quarter she
would be driven up broadsideon and capsiz we pull strongli in
and as soon as we felt that the sea had got hold of us and wa carri
us in with the speed of a racehors we threw the oar as far from the
boat as we could and took hold of the gunwal readi to spring out and
seiz her when she struck the offic us hi utmost strength to
keep her stern on we were shot up upon the beach like an arrow from a
bow and seiz the boat ran her up high and dry and soon pick up
our oar and stood by her readi for the captain to come down
find that the captain did not come immedi we put our oar in
the boat and leav on to watch it walk about the beach to see
what we could of the place the beach is nearli a mile in length
between the two point and of smooth sand we had taken the onli good
landingplac which is in the middl it be more stoni toward the
end it is about twenti yard in width from highwat mark to a
slight bank at which the soil begin and so hard that it is a favorit
place for run hors it wa grow dark so that we could just
distinguish the dim outlin of the two vessel in the of and the
great sea were roll in in regular line grow larger and larger
as thei approach the shore and hang over the beach upon which
thei were to break when their top would curl over and turn white with
foam and begin at on extrem of the line break rapidli to the
other as a long cardhous fall when the children knock down the
card at on end the sandwich island in the mean time had turn
their boat round and ran her down into the water and were load her
with hide and tallow as thi wa the work in which we were soon to
be engag we look on with some curios thei ran the boat into
the water so far that everi larg sea might float her and two of them
with their trowser roll up stood by the bow on on each side
keep her in her right posit thi wa hard work for besid the
forc thei had to us upon the boat the larg sea nearli took them
off their leg the other were run from the boat to the bank
upon which out of the reach of the water wa a pile of dry bullock
hide doubl lengthwis in the middl and nearli as stiff as board
these thei took upon their head on or two at a time and carri
down to the boat where on of their number stow them awai thei
were oblig to carri them on their head to keep them out of the
water and we observ that thei had on thick woolen cap look here
bill and see what your come to said on of our men to anoth
who stood by the boat well d said the second mate to me
thi doe not look much like cambridg colleg doe it thi is what
i call head work to tell the truth it did not look veri
encourag
after thei had got through with the hide thei laid hold of the bag
of tallow the bag ar made of hide and ar about the size of a
common meal bag and lift each upon the shoulder of two men on
at each end walk off with them to the boat and prepar to go
aboard here too wa someth for us to learn the man who
steer ship hi oar and stood up in the stern and those that
pull the after oar sat upon their bench with their oar ship
readi to strike out as soon as she wa afloat the two men at the bow
kept their place and when at length a larg sea came in and float
her seiz hold of the gunwal and ran out with her till thei were up
to their armpit and then tumbl over the gunwal into the bow
drip with water the men at the oar struck out but it wouldnt
do the sea swept back and left them nearli high and dry the two
fellow jump out again and the next time thei succeed better and
with the help of a deal of outlandish halloo and bawl got her
well off we watch them till thei were out of the breaker and saw
them steer for their vessel which wa now hidden in the dark
the sand of the beach began to be cold to our bare feet the frog set
up their croak in the marsh and on solitari owl from the end of
the distant point gave out hi melancholi note mellow by the
distanc and we began to think that it wa high time for the old
man as the captain is gener call to come down in a few
minut we heard someth come toward us it wa a man on

the sea were high some of them lift us up and slide from under
us seem to let us drop through the air like a flat plank upon the
bodi of the water in a few minut we were in the low regular swell

in the cours of the forenoon a boat went aboard of the ayacucho and
brought off a quarter of beef which made us a fresh bite for dinner
thi we were glad enough to have and the mate told us that we should
live upon fresh beef while we were on the coast as it wa cheaper here
than the salt while at dinner the cook call sail ho and come
on deck we saw two sail come round the point on wa a larg ship
under topgal sail and the other a small hermaphrodit brig
thei both back their topsail and sent boat aboard of us the
ship color had puzzl us and we found that she wa from genoa

captain unless he is also supercargo ha littl to do and is usual

as the mate wa a goodnatur man and not veri strict so it wa for a
time but we were wors off in the end for wherev the captain is a
sever energet man and the mate is want in both these qualiti
there will alwai be troubl and troubl we had alreadi begun to
anticip the captain had sever time found fault with the mate
in presenc of the crew and hint had been drop that all wa not
right between them when thi is the case and the captain suspect
that hi offic is too easi and familiar with the crew then he begin
to interfer in all the duti and to draw the rein tauter and the
crew have to suffer
chapter x

thi night after sundown it look black at the southward and
eastward and we were told to keep a bright lookout expect to be
call up we turn in earli wake up about midnight i found a man
who had just come down from hi watch strike a light he said that
it wa begin to puff up from the southeast and that the sea wa
roll in and he had call the captain and as he threw himself down
on hi chest with all hi cloth on i knew that he expect to be

surg and snap and lai awak expect an instant summon in
a few minut it camethre knock on the scuttl and all hand
ahoi bearahand up and make sail we sprang up for our cloth and
were about halfwai dress when the mate call out down the scuttl
tumbl up here men tumbl up befor she drag her anchor we were
on deck in an instant lai aloft and loos the topsail shout the
captain as soon as the first man show himself spring into the
rig i saw that the ayacucho topsail were loos and heard her
crew singingout at the sheet as thei were haul them home thi
had probabl start our captain as old wilson the captain of the
ayacucho had been mani year on the coast and knew the sign of the
weather we soon had the topsail loos and on hand remain as
usual in each top to overhaul the rig and light the sail out the
rest of us laid down to man the sheet while sheet home we saw
the ayacucho stand athwart our bow sharp upon the wind cut
through the head sea like a knife with her rake mast and sharp bow
run up like the head of a greyhound it wa a beauti sight
she wa like a bird which had been frighten and had spread her wing
in flight after the topsail had been sheet home the head yard
brace aback the foretopmast staysail hoist and the buoi
stream and all readi forward for slip we went aft and man
the sliprop which came through the stern port with a turn round the
timberhead all readi forward ask the captain ay ay sir
all readi answer the mate let go all gone sir and the
iron cabl grate over the windlass and through the hawsehol and the
littl vessel head swing off from the wind under the forc of her
back head sail brought the strain upon the sliprop let go
aft instantli all wa gone and we were under weigh as soon as she
wa well off from the wind we fill awai the head yard brace all
up sharp set the foresail and trysail and left our anchorag well
astern give the point a good berth nye off too said the
captain to the mate and look astern we could just see the littl
hermaphrodit brig under sail stand after us
it now began to blow fresh the rain fell fast and it grew veri black
but the captain would not take in sail until we were well clear of the
point as soon as we left thi on our quarter and were stand out
to sea the order wa given and we sprang aloft doubl reef each
topsail furl the foresail and doubl reef the trysail and were
soon under easi sail in those case of slip for southeast
there is noth to be done after you have got clear of the coast but
to lieto under easi sail and wait for the gale to be over which
seldom last more than two dai and is often over in twelv hour but
the wind never come back to the southward until there ha been a good
deal of rain fallen go below the watch said the mate but here wa
a disput which watch it should be which the mate soon howev settl
by send hi watch below sai that we should have our turn the
next time we got under weigh we remain on deck till the expir
of the watch the wind blow veri fresh and the rain come down in
torrent when the watch came up we wore ship and stood on the other
tack in toward land when we came up again which wa at four in the
morn it wa veri dark and there wa not much wind but it wa
rain as i thought i had never seen it rain befor we had on
oilcloth suit and southwest cap and had noth to do but to
stand bolt upright and let it pour down upon us there ar no
umbrella and no shed to go under at sea
while we were stand about on deck we saw the littl brig drift
by us hove to under her fore topsail doubl reef and she glide by
like a phantom not a word wa spoken and we saw no on on deck but
the man at the wheel toward morn the captain put hi head out of
the companionwai and told the second mate who command our watch to
look out for a chang of wind which usual follow a calm and heavi
rain and it wa well that he did for in a few minut it fell dead
calm the vessel lost her steeragewai and the rain ceas we haul
up the trysail and cours squar the after yard and wait for the
chang which came in a few minut with a vengeanc from the
northwest the opposit point of the compass ow to our
precaut we were not taken aback but ran befor the wind with
squar yard the captain come on deck we brace up a littl and
stood back for our anchorag with the chang of wind came a chang of
weather and in two hour the wind moder into the light steadi
breez which blow down the coast the greater part of the year and
from it regular might be call a tradewind the sun came up
bright and we set royal skysail and studdingsail and were under
fair wai for santa barbara the littl loriott wa astern of us
nearli out of sight but we saw noth of the ayacucho in a short
time she appear stand out from santa rosa island under the lee
of which she had been hove to all night our captain wa anxiou to
get in befor her for it would be a great credit to us on the coast
to beat the ayacucho which had been call the best sailer in the
north pacif in which she had been known as a trader for six year or
more we had an advantag over her in light wind from our royal and
skysail which we carri both at the fore and main and also in our
studdingsail for captain wilson carri noth abov
topgallantsail and alwai unbent hi studdingsail when on the
coast as the wind wa light and fair we held our own for some time
when we were both oblig to brace up and come upon a taut bowlin
after round the point and here he had us on fair ground and walk
awai from us as you would haul in a line he afterward said that we
sail well enough with the wind free but that give him a taut
bowlin and he would beat us if we had all the canva of the royal
georg
the ayacucho got to the anchor ground about half an hour befor us
and wa furl her sail when we came up to it thi pick up your
cabl is a veri nice piec of work it requir some seamanship to do
it and come to at your former moor without let go anoth
anchor captain wilson wa remark among the sailor on the coast
for hi skill in do thi and our captain never let go a second
anchor dure all the time that i wa with him come a littl to
windward of our buoi we clew up the light sail back our main
topsail and lower a boat which pull off and made fast a spare
hawser to the buoi on the end of the sliprop we brought the other
end to the captain and hove in upon it until we came to the sliprop
which we took to the windlass and walk her up to her chain the
captain help her by back and fill the sail the chain is
then pass through the hawsehol and round the windlass and bit
the sliprop taken round outsid and brought into the stern port and
she is safe in her old berth after we had got through the mate told
us that thi wa a small touch of california the like of which we must
expect to have through the winter
after we had furl the sail and got dinner we saw the loriott
near and she had her anchor befor night at sundown we went
ashor again and found the loriott boat wait on the beach the
sandwich island who could speak english told us that he had been up
to the town that our agent mr r and some other passeng were

a few minut captain t with two gentlemen and on femal came

we got clear of the island befor sunris the next morn and by
twelv oclock were out of the canal and off point concept the
place where we first made the land upon our arriv thi is the
largest point on the coast and is uninhabit headland stretch out
into the pacif and ha the reput of be veri windi ani
vessel doe well which get by it without a gale especi in the
winter season we were go along with studdingsail set on both
side when as we came round the point we had to haul our wind and
take in the lee studdingsail as the brig came more upon the wind
she felt it more and we dous the skysail but kept the weather
studdingsail on her brace the yard forward so that the
swingingboom nearli touch the spritsail yard she now lai over to
it the wind wa freshen and the captain wa evid drag on
to her hi brother and mr r look a littl squalli said
someth to him but he onli answer that he knew the vessel and what
she would carri he wa evid show off hi vessel and let
them know how he could carri sail he stood up to windward hold on
by the backstai and look up at the stick to see how much thei
would bear when a puff came which settl the matter then it wa
haul down and clew up royal flyingjib and studdingsail all
at onc there wa what the sailor call a messeveryth let go
noth haul in and everyth fly the poor spanish woman came
to the companionwai look as pale as a ghost and nearli frighten
to death the mate and some men forward were try to haul in the
lower studdingsail which had blown over the spritsail yardarm and
round the gui while the topmaststuddingsail boom after buckl up
and spring out again like a piec of whalebon broke off at the
boomiron i sprang aloft to take in the main topgal
studdingsail but befor i got into the top the tack part and awai
went the sail swing forward of the topgallantsail and tear
and slat itself to piec the halyard were at thi moment let go
by the run and such a piec of work i never had befor in take in a
sail after great exert i got it or the remain of it into the
top and wa make it fast when the captain look up call out
to me lai aloft there d and furl that main royal leav the
studdingsail i went up to the cross tree and here it look rather
squalli the foot of the topgallantmast wa work between the
cross and trussel tree and the royalmast lai over at a fear angl
with the mast below while everyth wa work and crack
strain to the utmost
there noth for jack to do but to obei order and i went up upon
the yard and there wa a wors mess if possibl than i had left
below the brace had been let go and the yard wa swing about
like a turnpikeg and the whole sail have blown over to leeward
the lee leach wa over the yardarm and the skysail wa all adrift
and fly over my head i look down but it wa in vain to attempt
to make myself heard for everi on wa busi below and the wind
roar and sail were flap in everi direct fortun it wa
noon and broad daylight and the man at the wheel who had hi ey
aloft soon saw my difficulti and after numberless sign and gestur
got some on to haul the necessari rope taut dure thi interv i
took a look below everyth wa in confus on deck the littl
vessel wa tear through the water as if she were mad the sea
fly over her and the mast lean over at an angl of fortyf
degre from the vertic at the other royalmasthead wa s
work awai at the sail which wa blow from him as fast as he
could gather it in the topgallantsail below me wa soon clew up
which reliev the mast and in a short time i got my sail furl and
went below but i lost overboard a new tarpaulin hat which troubl me
more than anyth els we work for about half an hour with might
and main and in an hour from the time the squall struck us from
have all our fly kite abroad we came down to doublereef
topsail and the stormsail
the wind had haul ahead dure the squall and we were stand
directli in for the point so as soon as we had got all snug we wore
round and stood off again and had the pleasant prospect of beat up
to monterei a distanc of an hundr mile against a violent head
wind befor night it began to rain and we had five dai of raini
stormi weather under close sail all the time and were blown sever
hundr mile off the coast in the midst of thi we discov that
our fore topmast wa sprung which no doubt happen in the squall
and were oblig to send down the fore topgallantmast and carri as
littl sail as possibl forward our four passeng were dreadfulli
sick so that we saw littl or noth of them dure the five dai
on the sixth dai it clear off and the sun came out bright but the
wind and sea were still veri high it wa quit like be at sea
again no land for hundr of mile and the captain take the sun
everi dai at noon our passeng now made their appear and i had
for the first time the opportun of see what a miser and
forlorn creatur a seasick passeng is sinc i had got over my own
sick the third dai from boston i had seen noth but hale
hearti men with their sea leg on and abl to go anywher for we
had no passeng and i will own there wa a pleasant feel of
superior in be abl to walk the deck and eat and go about and
compar on self with two poor miser pale creatur
stagger and shuffl about deck or hold on and look up with
giddi head to see us climb to the masthead or sit quietli
at work on the end of the lofti yard a well man at sea ha littl
sympathi with on who is seasick he is too apt to be consciou of a
comparison favor to hi own manhood after a few dai we made the
land at point pino pine which is the headland at the entranc of
the bai of monterei as we drew in and ran down the shore we could
distinguish well the face of the countri and found it better wood
than that to the southward of point concept in fact as i
afterward discov point concept mai be made the divid line
between two differ face of the countri as you go to the northward
of the point the countri becom more wood ha a richer appear
and is better suppli with water thi is the case with monterei and
still more so with san francisco while to the southward of the point
as at santa barbara san pedro and particularli san diego there is
veri littl wood and the countri ha a nake level appear though
it is still veri fertil
the bai of monterei is veri wide at the entranc be about
twentyfour mile between the two point ao nuevo at the north and
pino at the south but narrow gradual as you approach the town
which is situat in a bend or larg cove at the southeastern
extrem and about eighteen mile from the point which make the
whole depth of the bai the shore ar extrem well wood the
pine abound upon them and as it wa now the raini season
everyth wa as green as natur could make itth grass the
leav and all the bird were sing in the wood and great number
of wildfowl were fly over our head here we could lie safe from
the southeast we came to anchor within two cabl length of the
shore and the town lai directli befor us make a veri pretti
appear it hous be plaster which give a much better
effect than those of santa barbara which ar of a mudcolor the red
tile too on the roof contrast well with the white plaster
side and with the extrem green of the lawn upon which the
housesabout an hundr in numberwer dot about here and there
irregularli there ar in thi place and in everi other town which i
saw in california no street or fenc except here and there a
small patch wa fenc in for a garden so that the hous ar place
at random upon the green which as thei ar of on stori and of the
cottag form give them a pretti effect when seen from a littl
distanc
it wa a fine saturdai afternoon when we came to anchor the sun about
an hour high and everyth look pleasantli the mexican flag wa
fly from the littl squar presidio and the drum and trumpet of
the soldier who were out on parad sound over the water and gave
great life to the scene everi on wa delight with the appear
of thing we felt as though we had got into a christian which in the
sailor vocabulari mean civil countri the first impress
which california had made upon us wa veri disagreeableth open
roadstead of santa barbara anchor three mile from the shore
run out to sea befor everi southeast land in a high surf
with a littl darklook town a mile from the beach and not a sound
to be heard or anyth to be seen but sandwich island hide and
tallowbag add to thi the gale off point concept and no on can
be at a loss to account for our agreeabl disappoint in monterei
besid all thi we soon learn which wa of no small import to
us that there wa littl or no surf here and thi afternoon the beach
wa as smooth as a duckpond
we land the agent and passeng and found sever person wait
for them on the beach among whom were some who though dress in the
costum of the countri spoke english and who we afterward learn
were english and american who had marri and settl in the countri
i also connect with our arriv here anoth circumst which more
nearli concern myself viz my first act of what the sailor will
allow to be seamanshipsend down a royalyard i had seen it done
onc or twice at sea and an old sailor whose favor i had taken some
pain to gain had taught me carefulli everyth which wa necessari
to be done and in it proper order and advis me to take the first
opportun when we were in port and try it i told the second mate
with whom i had been pretti thick when he wa befor the mast that i
would do it and got him to ask the mate to send me up the first time
thei were struck accordingli i wa call upon and went up
repeat the oper over in my mind take care to get everyth
in it order for the slightest mistak spoil the whole fortun
i got through without ani word from the offic and heard the well
done of the mate when the yard reach the deck with as much
satisfact as i ever felt at cambridg on see a bene at the foot
of a latin exercis

the next dai be sundai which is the libertydai among merchantmen
when it is usual to let a part of the crew go ashor the sailor had
depend upon a dai on land and were alreadi disput who should ask
to go when upon be call in the morn we were turnedto upon
the rig and found that the topmast which had been sprung wa to
come down and a new on to go up and topgal and royalmast and
the rig to be set up thi wa too bad if there is anyth that
irrit sailor and make them feel hardli us it is be depriv
of their sabbath not that thei would alwai or inde gener
spend it religi but it is their onli dai of rest then too
thei ar often necessarili depriv of it by storm and unavoid
duti of all kind that to take it from them when ly quietli and
safe in port without ani urgent reason bear the more hardli the
onli reason in thi case wa that the captain had determin to have
the customhous offic on board on mondai and wish to have hi
brig in order jack is a slave aboard ship but still he ha mani
opportun of thwart and balk hi master when there is
danger or necess or when he is well us no on can work faster
than he but the instant he feel that he is kept at work for noth
no sloth could make less headwai he must not refus hi duti or be
in ani wai disobedi but all the work that an offic get out of
him he mai be welcom to everi man who ha been three month at sea
know how to work tom cox traversethre turn round the
longboat and a pull at the scuttledbutt thi morn everyth
went in thi wai soger wa the order of the dai send a man
below to get a block and he would capsiz everyth befor find

as much time to put thing in order again marlinespik were not to
be found knive want a prodigi deal of sharpen and
gener three or four were wait round the grindston at a time
when a man got to the masthead he would come slowli down again to get
someth which he had forgotten and after the tackl were got up
six men would pull less than three who pull with a will when the
mate wa out of sight noth wa done it wa all uphil work and
at eight oclock when we went to breakfast thing were nearli where
thei were when we began
dure our short meal the matter wa discuss on propos refus
to work but that wa mutini and of cours wa reject at onc i
rememb too that on of the men quot father taylor as thei
call the seamen preacher at boston who told them that if thei were
order to work on sundai thei must not refus their duti and the
blame would not come upon them after breakfast it leak out
through the offic that if we would get through our work soon we
might have a boat in the afternoon and go fish thi bait wa well
thrown and took with sever who were fond of fish and all began
to find that as we had on thing to do and were not to be kept at work
for the dai the sooner we did it the better
accordingli thing took a new aspect and befor two oclock thi
work which wa in a fair wai to last two dai wa done and five of
us went a fish in the jollyboat in the direct of point pino
but leav to go ashor wa refus here we saw the loriott which
sail with us from santa barbara come slowli in with a light
seabreez which set in toward afternoon have been becalm off
the point all the first part of the dai we took sever fish of
variou kind among which cod and perch abound and f the
cidev second mate who wa of our number brought up with hi hook

thi kind of busi wa new to us and we like it veri well for a
few dai though we were hard at work everi minut from daylight to
dark and sometim even later
by be thu continu engag in transport passeng with their
good to and fro we gain consider knowledg of the charact
dress and languag of the peopl the dress of the men wa as i have
befor describ it the women wore gown of variou texturesilk
crape calico etcmad after the european style except that the
sleev were short leav the arm bare and that thei were loos
about the waist have no corset thei wore shoe of kid or satin
sash or belt of bright color and almost alwai a necklac and
ear bonnet thei had none i onli saw on on the coast and
that belong to the wife of an american seacaptain who had settl in
san diego and had import the chaotic mass of straw and ribbon as a
choic present to hi new wife thei wear their hair which is almost
invari black or a veri dark brown long in their neck sometim
loos and sometim in long braid though the marri women often do
it up on a high comb their onli protect against the sun and
weather is a larg mantl which thei put over their head draw it
close round their face when thei go out of door which is gener
onli in pleasant weather when in the hous or sit out in front
of it which thei often do in fine weather thei usual wear a small
scarf or neckerchief of a rich pattern a band also about the top of
the head with a cross star or other ornament in front is common
their complexion ar variou dependinga well as their dress and
mannerupon their rank or in other word upon the amount of spanish
blood thei can lai claim to those who ar of pure spanish blood
have never intermarri with the aborigin have clear brunett
complexion and sometim even as fair as those of english women
there ar but few of these famili in california be mostli those
in offici station or who on the expir of their offic have
settl here upon properti which thei have acquir and other who
have been banish for state offenc these form the aristocraci
intermarri and keep up an exclus system in everi respect
thei can be told by their complexion dress manner and also by their
speech for call themselv castilian thei ar veri ambiti of
speak the pure castilian languag which is spoken in a somewhat
corrupt dialect by the lower class from thi upper class thei go
down by regular shade grow more and more dark and muddi until you
come to the pure indian who run about with noth upon him but a
small piec of cloth kept up by a wide leather strap drawn round hi
waist gener speak each person cast is decid by the
qualiti of the blood which show itself too plainli to be conceal
at first sight yet the least drop of spanish blood if it be onli of
quadroon or octoroon is suffici to rais them from the rank of
slave and entitl them to a suit of clothesboot hat cloak
spur long knife and all complet though coars and dirti as mai
beand to call themselv espaolo and to hold properti if thei
can get ani
the fond for dress among the women is excess and is often the
ruin of mani of them a present of a fine mantl or of a necklac or
pair of ear gain the favor of the greater part of them
noth is more common than to see a woman live in a hous of onli
two room and the ground for a floor dress in spangl satin shoe
silk gown high comb and gilt if not gold ear and necklac
if their husband do not dress them well enough thei will soon receiv
present from other thei us to spend whole dai on board our
vessel examin the fine cloth and ornament and frequent made
purchas at a rate which would have made a seamstress or waitingmaid
in boston open her ey
next to the love of dress i wa most struck with the fine of the
voic and beauti of the inton of both sex everi common
ruffianlook fellow with a slouch hat blanket cloak dirti
underdress and soil leather leggin appear to me to be speak
eleg spanish it wa a pleasur simpli to listen to the sound of
the languag befor i could attach ani mean to it thei have a good
deal of the creol drawl but it is vari with an occasion extrem
rapid of utter in which thei seem to skip from conson to
conson until light upon a broad open vowel thei rest upon
that to restor the balanc of sound the women carri thi peculiar
of speak to a much greater extrem than the men who have more
even and stateli of utter a common bullockdriv on
horseback deliv a messag seem to speak like an ambassador at
an audienc in fact thei sometim appear to me to be a peopl on
whom a curs had fallen and strip them of everyth but their
pride their manner and their voic
anoth thing that surpris me wa the quantiti of silver that wa in
circul i certainli never saw so much silver at on time in my
life as dure the week that we were at monterei the truth is thei
have no credit system no bank and no wai of invest monei but in
cattl thei have no circul medium but silver and hideswhich
the sailor call california bank note everyth that thei bui thei
must pai for in on or the other of these thing the hide thei bring
down dri and doubl in clumsi oxcart or upon mule back and
the monei thei carri ti up in a handkerchieffifti eighti or an
hundr dollar and half dollar
i had never studi spanish while at colleg and could not speak a
word when at juan fernandez but dure the latter part of the passag
out i borrow a grammar and dictionari from the cabin and by a
continu us of these and a care attent to everi word that i
heard spoken i soon got a vocabulari togeth and began talk for
myself as i soon knew more spanish than ani of the crew who inde
knew none at all and had been at colleg and knew latin i got the
name of a great linguist and wa alwai sent for by the captain and
offic to get provis or to carri letter and messag to
differ part of the town i wa often sent to get someth which i
could not tell the name of to save my life but i like the busi
and accordingli never plead ignor sometim i manag to jump
below and take a look at my dictionari befor go ashor or els i
overhaul some english resid on my wai and got the word from him
and then by sign and the help of my latin and french contriv to
get along thi wa a good exercis for me and no doubt taught me
more than i should have learn by month of studi and read it also
gave me opportun of see the custom charact and domest
arrang of the peopl besid be a great relief from the
monotoni of a dai spent on board ship
monterei as far as my observ goe is decidedli the pleasantest
and most civilizedlook place in california in the centr of it is
an open squar surround by four line of onestori plaster
build with half a dozen cannon in the centr some mount and
other not thi is the presidio or fort everi town ha a
presidio in it centr or rather everi presidio ha a town built
around it for the fort were first built by the mexican govern
and then the peopl built near them for protect the presidio here
wa entir open and unfortifi there were sever offic with
long titl and about eighti soldier but thei were poorli paid fed
cloth and disciplin the governorgener or as he is commonli
call the gener live here which make it the seat of
govern he is appoint by the central govern at mexico and
is the chief civil and militari offic in addit to him each town
ha a command who is the chief militari offic and ha charg of
the fort and of all transact with foreign and foreign vessel
and two or three alcald and corregidor elect by the inhabit
who ar the civil offic court and jurisprud thei have no
knowledg of small municip matter ar regul by the alcald
and corregidor and everyth relat to the gener govern to
the militari and to foreign by the command act under the
governorgener capit case ar decid by him upon person
inspect if he is near or upon minut sent by the proper offic
if the offend is at a distant place no protest ha ani civil
right nor can he hold ani properti or inde remain more than a
few week on shore unless he belong to some vessel consequ the
american and english who intend to remain here becom cathol to a
man the current phrase among them beinga man must leav hi
conscienc at cape horn
but to return to monterei the hous here as everywher els in
california ar of on stori built of clai made into larg brick
about a foot and a half squar and three or four inch thick and
harden in the sun these ar cement togeth by mortar of the same
materi and the whole ar of a common dirtcolor the floor ar
gener of earth the window grate and without glass and the
door which ar seldom shut open directli into the common room there
be no entri some of the more wealthi inhabit have glass to
their window and board floor and in monterei nearli all the hous
ar plaster on the outsid the better hous too have red tile
upon the roof the common on have two or three room which open
into each other and ar furnish with a bed or two a few chair and
tabl a lookingglass a crucifix of some materi or other and
small daub of paint enclos in glass and repres some
miracl or martyrdom thei have no chimnei or fireplac in the
hous the climat be such as to make a fire unnecessari and all
their cook is done in a small cookhous separ from the hous
the indian as i have said befor do all the hard work two or three
be attach to each hous and the poorest person ar abl to keep
on at least for thei have onli to feed them and give them a small
piec of coars cloth and a belt for the male and a coars gown
without shoe or stock for the femal
in monterei there ar a number of english and american english or
ingl all ar call who speak the english languag who have
marri californian becom unit to the cathol church and
acquir consider properti have more industri frugal and
enterpris than the nativ thei soon get nearli all the trade into
their hand thei usual keep shop in which thei retail the good
purchas in larger quantiti from our vessel and also send a good
deal into the interior take hide in pai which thei again barter
with our vessel in everi town on the coast there ar foreign
engag in thi kind of trade while i recollect but two shop kept by
nativ the peopl ar gener suspici of foreign and thei
would not be allow to remain were it not that thei becom good
cathol and by marri nativ and bring up their children as
cathol and mexican and not teach them the english languag
thei quiet suspicion and even becom popular and lead men the
chief alcald in monterei and santa barbara were both yanke by birth
the men in monterei appear to me to be alwai on horseback hors
ar as abund here as dog and chicken were in juan fernandez there
ar no stabl to keep them in but thei ar allow to run wild and
graze wherev thei pleas be brand and have long leather
rope call lasso attach to their neck and drag along
behind them by which thei can be easili taken the men usual catch
on in the morn throw a saddl and bridl upon him and us him for
the dai and let him go at night catch anoth the next dai when
thei go on long journei thei ride on hors down and catch anoth
throw the saddl and bridl upon him and after ride him down take a
third and so on to the end of the journei there ar probabl no
better rider in the world thei get upon a hors when onli four or
five year old their littl leg not long enough to come half wai over
hi side and mai almost be said to keep on him until thei have grown
to him the stirrup ar cover or box up in front to prevent
their catch when ride through the wood and the saddl ar larg
and heavi strap veri tight upon the hors and have larg pommel
or loggerhead in front round which the lasso is coil when not in
us thei can hardli go from on hous to anoth without get on a
hors there be gener sever stand ti to the doorpost of
the littl cottag when thei wish to show their activ thei make
no us of their stirrup in mount but strike the hors spring
into the saddl as he start and stick their long spur into him
go off on the full run their spur ar cruel thing have four or
five rowel each an inch in length dull and rusti the flank of the
hors ar often sore from them and i have seen men come in from
chase bullock with their hors hind leg and quarter cover with
blood thei frequent give exhibit of their horsemanship in
race bullbait etc but as we were not ashor dure ani
holydai we saw noth of it monterei is also a great place for
cockfight gambl of all sort fandango and everi kind of
amus and knaveri trapper and hunter who occasion arriv
here from over the rocki mountain with their valuabl skin and fur
ar often entertain with everi sort of amus and dissip
until thei have wast their time and their monei and go back
strip of everyth
noth but the charact of the peopl prevent monterei from becom
a great town the soil is as rich as man could wish climat as good
as ani in the world water abund and situat extrem beauti
the harbor too is a good on be subject onli to on bad wind the
north and though the holdingground is not the best yet i heard of
but on vessel be driven ashor here that wa a mexican brig
which went ashor a few month befor our arriv and wa a total
wreck all the crew but on be drown yet thi wa from the
careless or ignor of the captain who paid out all hi small
cabl befor he let go hi other anchor the ship lagoda of boston
wa there at the time and rode out the gale in safeti without
drag at all or find it necessari to strike her topgal
mast
the onli vessel in port with us wa the littl loriott i frequent
went on board her and becam veri well acquaint with her sandwich
island crew on of them could speak a littl english and from him i
learn a good deal about them thei were well form and activ with
black ey intellig counten darkol or i should rather
sai copper complexion and coars black hair but not woolli like the
negro thei appear to be talk continu in the forecastl
there wa a complet babel their languag is extrem guttur and
not pleasant at first but improv as you hear it more and is said to
have great capac thei us a good deal of gesticul and ar
exceedingli anim sai with their might what their tongu find
to sai thei ar complet waterdog therefor veri good in boat
it is for thi reason that there ar so mani of them on the coast of
california thei be veri good hand in the surf thei ar also
quick and activ in the rig and good hand in warm weather but
those who have been with them round cape horn and in high latitud
sai that thei ar useless in cold weather in their dress thei ar
precis like our sailor in addit to these island the vessel
had two english sailor who act as boatswain over the island
and took care of the rig on of them i shall alwai rememb as
the best specimen of the thoroughbr english sailor that i ever saw
he had been to sea from a boi have serv a regular apprenticeship
of seven year as all english sailor ar oblig to do and wa then
about four or five and twenti he wa tall but you onli perceiv it
when he wa stand by the side of other for the great breadth of
hi shoulder and chest made him appear but littl abov the middl
height hi chest wa as deep as it wa wide hi arm like that of
hercul and hi hand the fist of a tareveri hair a ropeyarn
with all thi he had on of the pleasantest smile i ever saw hi
cheek were of a handsom brown hi teeth brilliantli white and hi
hair of a raven black wave in loos curl all over hi head and
fine open forehead and hi ey he might have sold to a duchess at
the price of diamond for their brillianc as for their color thei
were like the irishman pig which would not stai to be count everi
chang of posit and light seem to give them a new hue but their
prevail color wa black or nearli so take him with hi
wellvarnish black tarpaulin stuck upon the back of hi head hi
long lock come down almost into hi ey hi white duck trowser
and shirt blue jacket and black kerchief ti loos round hi
neck and he wa a fine specimen of manli beauti on hi broad chest
he had stamp with india ink part momentsa ship readi to sail
a boat on the beach and a girl and her sailor lover take their
farewel underneath were print the initi of hi own name and two
other letter stand for some name which he knew better than i did
thi wa veri well done have been execut by a man who made it hi
busi to print with india ink for sailor at havr on on of hi
broad arm he had the crucifixion and on the other the sign of the
foul anchor
he wa veri fond of read and we lent him most of the book which we
had in the forecastl which he read and return to us the next time
we fell in with him he had a good deal of inform and hi
captain said he wa a perfect seaman and worth hi weight in gold on
board a vessel in fair weather and in foul hi strength must have
been great and he had the sight of a vultur it is strang that on
should be so minut in the descript of an unknown outcast sailor
whom on mai never see again and whom no on mai care to hear about
but so it is some peopl we see under no remark circumst but
whom for some reason or other we never forget he call himself
bill jackson and i know no on of all my accident acquaint to
whom i would more gladli give a shake of the hand than to him whoever
fall in with him will find a handsom hearti fellow and a good
shipmat
sundai came again while we were at monterei but as befor it brought
us no holydai the peopl on shore dress themselv and came off in
greater number than ever and we were emploi all dai in boat and
break out cargo so that we had hardli time to eat our cidev
second mate who wa determin to get liberti if it wa to be had
dress himself in a long coat and black hat and polish hi shoe
and went aft and ask to go ashor he could not have done a more
imprud thing for he knew that no liberti would be given and
besid sailor howev sure thei mai be of have liberti grant
them alwai go aft in their work cloth to appear as though thei
had no reason to expect anyth and then wash dress and shave
after thei get their liberti but thi poor fellow wa alwai get
into hot water and if there wa a wrong wai of do a thing wa sure
to hit upon it we look to see him go aft know pretti well what
hi recept would be the captain wa walk the quarterdeck
smoke hi morn cigar and f went as far as the break of the
deck and there wait for him to notic him the captain took two or
three turn and then walk directli up to him survei him from
head to foot and lift up hi forefing said a word or two in a
tone too low for us to hear but which had a magic effect upon poor
f he walk forward sprang into the forecastl and in a moment
more made hi appear in hi common cloth and went quietli to
work again what the captain said to him we never could get him to
tell but it certainli chang him outwardli and inwardli in a most
surpris manner

after a few dai find the trade begin to slacken we hove our
anchor up set our topsail ran the star and stripe up to the peak
fire a gun which wa return from the presidio and left the littl
town astern run out of the bai and bear down the coast again
for santa barbara as we were now go to leeward we had a fair wind
and a plenti of it after doubl point pino we bore up set
studdingsail alow and aloft and were walk off at the rate of
eight or nine knot promis to travers in twentyfour hour the
distanc which we were nearli three week in travers on the passag
up we pass point concept at a fly rate the wind blow so
that it would have seem half a gale to us if we had been go the
other wai and close haul as we drew near the island off santa
barbara it di awai a littl but we cameto at our old
anchoringground in less than thirti hour from the time of leav
monterei
here everyth wa pretti much as we left itth larg bai without a
vessel in it the surf roar and roll in upon the beach the white
mission the dark town and the high treeless mountain here too we
had our southeast tack aboard againsliprop buoyrop sail
furl with reef in them and ropeyarn for gasket we lai here
about a fortnight emploi in land good and take off hide
occasion when the surf wa not high but there did not appear to
be onehalf the busi do here that there wa in monterei in
fact so far as we were concern the town might almost as well have
been in the middl of the cordillera we lai at a distanc of three
mile from the beach and the town wa nearli a mile farther so that
we saw littl or noth of it occasion we land a few good
which were taken awai by indian in larg clumsi oxcart with the
yoke on the ox neck instead of under it and with small solid wheel
a few hide were brought down which we carri off in the california
style thi we had now got pretti well accustom to and harden to
also for it doe requir a littl harden even to the toughest
the hide ar alwai brought down dry or thei would not be receiv
when thei ar taken from the anim thei have hole cut in the end
and ar stake out and thu dri in the sun without shrink thei
ar then doubl onc lengthwis with the hair side usual in and
sent down upon mule or in cart and pile abov highwat mark and
then we rake them upon our head on at a time or two if thei ar
small and wade out with them and throw them into the boat which as
there ar no wharv we ar usual kept anchor by a small kedg or
keelek just outsid of the surf we all provid ourselv with thick
scotch cap which would be soft to the head and at the same time
protect it for we soon found that howev it might look or feel at
first the headwork wa the onli system for california for besid
that the sea break high often oblig us to carri the hide so
in order to keep them dry we found that as thei were veri larg and
heavi and nearli as stiff as board it wa the onli wai that we could
carri them with ani conveni to ourselv some of the crew tri
other expedi sai that thei look too much like west india
negro but thei all came to it at last the great art is in get
them on the head we had to take them from the ground and as thei
were often veri heavi and as wide as the arm could stretch and easili
taken by the wind we us to have some troubl with them i have
often been laugh at myself and join in laugh at other
pitch themselv down in the sand try to swing a larg hide upon
their head or nearli blown over with on in a littl gust of wind
the captain made it harder for us by tell us that it wa
california fashion to carri two on the head at a time and as he
insist upon it and we did not wish to be outdon by other vessel
we carri two for the first few month but after fall in with a
few other hidedrogh and find that thei carri onli on at a
time we knock off the extra on and thu made our duti somewhat
easier
after we had got our head us to the weight and had learn the true
california style of toss a hide we could carri off two or three
hundr in a short time without much troubl but it wa alwai wet
work and if the beach wa stoni bad for our feet for we of cours
alwai went barefoot on thi duti as no shoe could stand such
constant wet with salt water then too we had a long pull of
three mile with a load boat which often took a coupl of hour
we had now got well settl down into our harbor duti which as thei
ar a good deal differ from those at sea it mai be well enough to
describ in the first place all hand ar call at daylight or
ratherespeci if the dai ar shortbefor daylight as soon as
the first grei of the morn the cook make hi fire in the gallei
the steward goe about hi work in the cabin and the crew rig the head
pump and wash down the deck the chief mate is alwai on deck but
take no activ part all the duti come upon the second mate who ha
to roll up hi trowser and paddl about deck barefoot like the
rest of the crew the wash swab squilge etc last or
is made to last until eight oclock when breakfast is order fore
and aft after breakfast for which half an hour is allow the boat
ar lower down and made fast astern or out to the swing boom
by geswarp and the crew ar turnedto upon their dai work thi
is variou and it charact depend upon circumst there is
alwai more or less of boat in small boat and if heavi good ar
to be taken ashor or hide ar brought down to the beach for us then
all hand ar sent ashor with an offic in the long boat then there
is alwai a good deal to be done in the hold good to be broken out
and cargo to be shift to make room for hide or to keep the trim of
the vessel in addit to thi the usual work upon the rig must
be done there is a good deal of the latter kind of work which can
onli be done when the vessel is in portand then everyth must be
kept taut and in good order spunyarn made chafe gear repair
and all the other ordinari work the great differ between sea and
harbor duti is in the divis of time instead of have a watch on
deck and a watch below as at sea all hand ar at work togeth
except at meal time from daylight till dark and at night an
anchorwatch is kept which consist of onli two at a time the whole
crew take turn an hour is allow for dinner and at dark the
deck ar clear up the boat hoist supper order and at eight
the light put out except in the binnacl where the glass stand and
the anchorwatch is set thu when at anchor the crew have more time
at night stand watch onli about two hour but have no time to
themselv in the dai so that read mend cloth etc ha to
be put off until sundai which is usual given some religi
captain give their crew saturdai afternoon to do their wash and
mend in so that thei mai have their sundai free thi is a good
arrang and doe much toward creat the prefer sailor
usual show for religi vessel we were well satisfi if we got
sundai to ourselv for if ani hide came down on that dai as wa
often the case when thei were brought from a distanc we were oblig
to bring them off which usual took half a dai and as we now live
on fresh beef and at on bullock a week the anim wa almost alwai
brought down on sundai and we had to go ashor kill it dress it and
bring it aboard which wa anoth interrupt then too our
common dai work wa protract and made more fatigu by hide
come down late in the afternoon which sometim kept us at work in
the surf by starlight with the prospect of pull on board and
stow them all awai befor supper
but all these littl vexat and labor would have been
nothingthei would have been pass by as the common evil of a
sealif which everi sailor who is a man will go through without
complaintwer it not for the uncertainti or wors than uncertainti
which hung over the natur and length of our voyag here we were in
a littl vessel with a small crew on a halfcivil coast at the
end of the earth and with a prospect of remain an indefinit
period two or three year at the least when we left boston we
suppos that it wa to be a voyag of eighteen month or two year
at most but upon arriv on the coast we learn someth more of
the trade and found that in the scarciti of hide which wa yearli
greater and greater it would take us a year at least to collect our
own cargo besid the passag out and home and that we were also to
collect a cargo for a larg ship belong to the same firm which wa
soon to come on the coast and to which we were to act as tender we
had heard rumor of such a ship to follow us which had leak out from
the captain and mate but we pass them by as mere yarn till our
arriv when thei were confirm by the letter which we brought from
the owner to their agent the ship california belong to the same
firm had been nearli two year on the coast had collect a full
cargo and wa now at san diego from which port she wa expect to
sail in a few week for boston and we were to collect all the hide we
could and deposit them at san diego when the new ship which would
carri forti thousand wa to be fill and sent home and then we were
to begin anew and collect our own cargo here wa a gloomi prospect
befor us inde the california had been twenti month on the coast
and the lagoda a smaller ship carri onli thirtyon or thirtytwo
thousand had been two year get her cargo and we were to collect
a cargo of forti thousand besid our own which would be twelv or
fifteen thousand and hide were said to be grow scarcer then
too thi ship which had been to us a wors phantom than ani fly
dutchman wa no phantom or ideal thing but had been reduc to a
certainti so much so that a name wa given her and it wa said that
she wa to be the alert a wellknown indiaman which wa expect in
boston in a few month when we sail there could be no doubt and
all look black enough hint were thrown out about three year and
four yearsth older sailor said thei never should see boston again
but should lai their bone in california and a cloud seem to hang
over the whole voyag besid we were not provid for so long a
voyag and cloth and all sailor necessari were excess
dearthre or four hundr per cent advanc upon the boston price
thi wa bad enough for them but still wors wa it for me who did
not mean to be a sailor for life have intend onli to be gone
eighteen month or two year three or four year would make me a
sailor in everi respect mind and habit as well as bodynolen
volen and would put all my companion so far ahead of me that colleg
and a profess would be in vain to think of and i made up my mind
that feel as i might a sailor i must be and to be master of a
vessel must be the height of my ambit
besid the length of the voyag and the hard and expos life we were
at the end of the earth on a coast almost solitari in a countri
where there is neither law nor gospel and where sailor ar at their
captain merci there be no american consul or ani on to whom a
complaint could be made we lost all interest in the voyag care
noth about the cargo which we were onli collect for other
began to patch our cloth and felt as though we were fix beyond all
hope of chang
in addit to and perhap partli as a consequ of thi state of
thing there wa troubl brew on board the vessel our mate as
the first mate is alwai call par excel wa a worthi mana
more honest upright and kindheart man i never saw but he wa too
good for the mate of a merchantman he wa not the man to call a
sailor a son of a bh and knock him down with a handspik he
want the energi and spirit for such a voyag as our and for such a
captain captain t wa a vigor energet fellow as sailor
sai he hadnt a lazi bone in him he wa made of steel and
whalebon he wa a man to toe the mark and to make everi on els
step up to it dure all the time that i wa with him i never saw
him sit down on deck he wa alwai activ and drive sever in hi
disciplin and expect the same of hi offic the mate not be
enough of a driver for him and be perhap too easi with the crew
he wa dissatisfi with him becam suspici that disciplin wa
get relax and began to interfer in everyth he drew the
rein tauter and as in all quarrel between offic the sailor
side with the on who treat them best he becam suspici of the
crew he saw that everyth went wrongthat noth wa done with a
will and in hi attempt to remedi the difficulti by sever he made
everyth wors we were in everi respect unfortun situat
captain offic and crew entir unfit for on anoth and
everi circumst and event wa like a twoedg sword and cut both
wai the length of the voyag which made us dissatisfi made the
captain at the same time feel the necess of order and strict
disciplin and the natur of the countri which caus us to feel that
we had nowher to go for redress but were entir at the merci of a
hard master made the captain feel on the other hand that he must
depend entir upon hi own resourc sever creat discont
and sign of discont provok sever then too illtreat
and dissatisfact ar no linimenta laborum and mani a time have i
heard the sailor sai that thei should not mind the length of the
voyag and the hardship if thei were onli kindli treat and if
thei could feel that someth wa done to make thing lighter and
easier we felt as though our situat wa a call upon our superior
to give us occasion relax and to make our yoke easier but
the contrari polici wa pursu we were kept at work all dai when in
port which togeth with a watch at night made us glad to turnin as
soon as we got below thu we got no time for read orwhich wa of
more import to usfor wash and mend our cloth and then
when we were at sea sail from port to port instead of give us
watch and watch as wa the custom on board everi other vessel on the
coast we were all kept on deck and at work rain or shine make
spunyarn and rope and at other work in good weather and pick
oakum when it wa too wet for anyth els all hand were call to
come up and see it rain and kept on deck hour after hour in a
drench rain stand round the deck so far apart as to prevent our
talk with on anoth with our tarpaulin and oilcloth jacket on
pick old rope to piec or lai up gasket and roband thi wa
often done too when we were ly in port with two anchor down and
no necess for more than on man on deck as a lookout thi is what
is call haze a crew and work their old iron up
while ly at santa barbara we encount anoth southeast and
like the first it came on in the night the great black cloud come
round from the southward cover the mountain and hang down over
the town appear almost to rest upon the roof of the hous we
made sail slip our cabl clear the point and beat about for
four dai in the of under close sail with continu rain and
high sea and wind no wonder thought we thei have no rain in the
other season for enough seem to have fallen in those four dai to
last through a common summer on the fifth dai it clear up after a
few hour as is usual of rain come down like a four hour
showerbath and we found ourselv drift nearli ten leagu from the
anchorag and have light head wind we did not return until the
sixth dai have recov our anchor we made prepar for
get under weigh to go down to leeward we had hope to go directli
to san diego and thu fall in with the california befor she sail
for boston but our order were to stop at an intermedi port call
san pedro and as we were to lie there a week or two and the
california wa to sail in a few dai we lost the opportun just
befor sail the captain took on board a short redhair
roundshould vulgarlook fellow who had lost on ey and
squint with the other and introduc him as mr russel told us
that he wa an offic on board thi wa too bad we had lost
overboard on the passag on of the best of our number anoth had
been taken from us and appoint clerk and thu weaken and reduc
instead of ship some hand to make our work easier he had put
anoth offic over us to watch and drive us we had now four
offic and onli six in the forecastl thi wa bring her too
much down by the stern for our comfort
leav santa barbara we coast along down the countri appear
level or moder uneven and for the most part sandi and treeless
until doubl a high sandi point we let go our anchor at a distanc
of three or three and a half mile from shore it wa like a vessel
bound to halifax come to anchor on the grand bank for the shore
be low appear to be at a greater distanc than it actual wa
and we thought we might as well have staid at santa barbara and sent
our boat down for the hide the land wa of a clayei consist and
as far as the ey could reach entir bare of tree and even shrub
and there wa no sign of a townnot even a hous to be seen what
brought us into such a place we could not conceiv no sooner had we
come to anchor than the sliprop and the other prepar for
southeast were got readi and there wa reason enough for it for
we lai expos to everi wind that could blow except the northwest
and that came over a flat countri with a rang of more than a leagu of
water as soon as everyth wa snug on board the boat wa lower
and we pull ashor our new offic who had been sever time in
the port befor take the place of steersman as we drew in we found
the tide low and the rock and stone cover with kelp and seawe
ly bare for the distanc of nearli an eighth of a mile pick our
wai barefoot over these we came to what is call the landingplac
at highwat mark the soil wa as it appear at first loos and
clayei and except the stalk of the mustard plant there wa no
veget just in front of the land and immedi over it wa
a small hill which from it be not more than thirti or forti feet
high we had not perceiv from our anchorag over thi hill we saw
three men come down dress partli like sailor and partli like
californian on of them have on a pair of untan leather trowser
and a red baiz shirt when thei came down to us we found that thei
were englishmen and thei told us that thei had belong to a small
mexican brig which had been driven ashor here in a southeast and
now live in a small hous just over the hill go up thi hill with
them we saw just behind it a small low build with on room
contain a fireplac cook apparatu etc and the rest of it
unfinish and us as a place to store hide and good thi thei
told us wa built by some trader in the pueblo a town about thirti
mile in the interior to which thi wa the port and us by them as
a storehous and also as a lodg place when thei came down to trade
with the vessel these three men were emploi by them to keep the
hous in order and to look out for the thing store in it thei said
that thei had been there nearli a year had noth to do most of the
time live upon beef hard bread and frijol a peculiar kind of
bean veri abund in california the nearest hous thei told us
wa a rancho or cattlefarm about three mile off and on of them
went up at the request of our offic to order a hors to be sent
down with which the agent who wa on board might go up to the
pueblo from on of them who wa an intellig english sailor i
learn a good deal in a few minut convers about the place
it trade and the new from the southern port san diego he said
wa about eighti mile to the leeward of san pedro that thei had heard
from there by a mexican who came up on horseback that the california
had sail for boston and that the lagoda which had been in san pedro
onli a few week befor wa take in her cargo for boston the
ayacucho wa also there load for callao and the littl loriott
which had run directli down from monterei where we left her san
diego he told me wa a small snug place have veri littl trade
but decidedli the best harbor on the coast be complet
landlock and the water as smooth as a duckpond thi wa the depot
for all the vessel engag in the trade each on have a larg hous
there built of rough board in which thei stow their hide as fast
as thei collect them in their trip up and down the coast and when
thei had procur a full cargo spent a few week there take it in
smoke ship suppli wood and water and make other prepar
for the voyag home the lagoda wa now about thi busi when we
should be about it wa more than i could tell two year at least i
thought to myself
i also learn to my surpris that the desolatelook place we were
in wa the best place on the whole coast for hide it wa the onli
port for a distanc of eighti mile and about thirti mile in the
interior wa a fine plane countri fill with herd of cattl in the
centr of which wa the pueblo de lo angelosth largest town in
californiaand sever of the wealthiest mission to all of which san
pedro wa the seaport
have made our arrang for a hors to take the agent to the
pueblo the next dai we pick our wai again over the green slipperi
rock and pull aboard by the time we reach the vessel which wa
so far off that we could hardli see her in the increas dark
the boat were hoist up and the crew at supper go down into the
forecastl eat our supper and light our cigar and pipe we
had as usual to tell all we had seen or heard ashor we all agre
that it wa the worst place we had seen yet especi for get off
hide and our ly off at so great a distanc look as though it wa
bad for southeast after a few disput as to whether we should
have to carri our good up the hill or not we talk of san diego
the probabl of see the lagoda befor she sail etc etc
the next dai we pull the agent ashor and he went up to visit the
pueblo and the neighbor mission and in a few dai as the result
of hi labor larg oxcart and drove of mule load with hide
were seen come over the flat countri we load our longboat with
good of all kind light and heavi and pull ashor after land
and roll them over the stone upon the beach we stop wait
for the cart to come down the hill and take them but the captain soon
settl the matter by order us to carri them all up to the top
sai that that wa california fashion so what the oxen would not
do we were oblig to do the hill wa low but steep and the earth
be clayei and wet with the recent rain wa but bad holdingground
for our feet the heavi barrel and cask we roll up with some
difficulti get behind and put our shoulder to them now and
then our feet slip ad to the danger of the cask roll back
upon us but the greatest troubl wa with the larg box of sugar
these we had to place upon oar and lift them up rest the oar
upon our shoulder and creep slowli up the hill with the gait of a
funer process after an hour or two of hard work we got them all
up and found the cart stand full of hide which we had to unload
and also to load again with our own good the lazi indian who came
down with them squat down on their ham look on do
noth and when we ask them to help us onli shake their head
or drawl out no quiero
have load the cart we start up the indian who went off on
on each side of the oxen with long stick sharpen at the end to
punch them with thi is on of the mean of save labor in
californiatwo indian to two oxen now the hide were to be got
down and for thi purpos we brought the boat round to a place where
the hill wa steeper and threw them down let them slide over the
slope mani of them lodg and we had to let ourselv down and set
them ago again and in thi wai got cover with dust and our
cloth torn after we had got them all down we were oblig to take
them on our head and walk over the stone and through the water to
the boat the water and the stone togeth would wear out a pair of
shoe a dai and as shoe were veri scarc and veri dear we were
compel to go barefoot at night we went on board have had the
hardest and most disagre dai work that we had yet experienc
for sever dai we were emploi in thi manner until we had land
forti or fifti ton of good and brought on board about two thousand
hide when the trade began to slacken and we were kept at work on
board dure the latter part of the week either in the hold or upon
the rig on thursdai night there wa a violent blow from the
northward but as thi wa offshor we had onli to let go our other
anchor and hold on we were call up at night to send down the
royalyard it wa as dark as a pocket and the vessel pitch at
her anchor i went up to the fore and my friend s to the main
and we soon had them down shipshap and bristol fashion for as we

a hand against him thei would have had noth befor them but flight
and starvat in the wood of california or captur by the soldier
and indian bloodhound whom the offer of twenti dollar would have
set upon them
after the dai work wa done we went down into the forecastl and
at our plain supper but not a word wa spoken it wa saturdai
night but there wa no songno sweetheart and wive a gloom wa
over everyth the two men lai in their berth groan with pain
and we all turn in but for myself not to sleep a sound come now
and then from the berth of the two men show that thei were awak as
awak thei must have been for thei could hardli lie in on postur a
moment the dim swing lamp of the forecastl shed it light over
the dark hole in which we live and mani and variou reflect and
purpos cours through my mind i thought of our situat live
under a tyranni of the charact of the countri we were in of the
length of the voyag and of the uncertainti attend our return to
america and then if we should return of the prospect of obtain
justic and satisfact for these poor men and vow that if god
should ever give me the mean i would do someth to redress the
grievanc and reliev the suffer of that poor class of be of
whom i then wa on
the next dai wa sundai we work as usual wash deck etc
until breakfasttim after breakfast we pull the captain ashor
and find some hide there which had been brought down the night
befor he order me to stai ashor and watch them sai that the
boat would come again befor night thei left me and i spent a quiet
dai on the hill eat dinner with the three men at the littl hous
unfortun thei had no book and after talk with them and
walk about i began to grow tire of do noth the littl
brig the home of so much hardship and suffer lai in the of
almost as far as on could see and the onli other thing which broke
the surfac of the great bai wa a small desolatelook island
steep and conic of a clayei soil and without the sign of veget
life upon it yet which had a peculiar and melancholi interest to me
for on the top of it were buri the remain of an englishman the
command of a small merchant brig who di while ly in thi port
it wa alwai a solemn and interest spot to me there it stood
desol and in the midst of desol and there were the remain of
on who di and wa buri alon and friendless had it been a common
buryingplac it would have been noth the singl bodi
correspond well with the solitari charact of everyth around it
wa the onli thing in california from which i could ever extract
anyth like poetri then too the man di far from home without a
friend near him by poison it wa suspect and no on to inquir
into it and without proper funer rite the mate as i wa told
glad to have him out of the wai hurri him up the hill and into the
ground without a word or a prayer
i look anxious for a boat dure the latter part of the afternoon
but none came until toward sundown when i saw a speck on the water
and as it drew near i found it wa the gig with the captain the
hide then were not to go off the captain came up the hill with a
man bring my monkei jacket and a blanket he look pretti black
but inquir whether i had enough to eat told me to make a hous out
of the hide and keep myself warm as i should have to sleep there
among them and to keep good watch over them i got a moment to speak
to the man who brought my jacket
how do thing go aboard said i
bad enough said he hard work and not a kind word spoken
what said i have you been at work all dai
ye no more sundai for us everyth ha been move in the hold
from stem to stern and from the waterwai to the keelson
i went up to the hous to supper we had frijol the perpetu food
of the californian but which when well cook ar the best bean in
the world coffe made of burnt wheat and hard bread after our meal
the three men sat down by the light of a tallow candl with a pack of
greasi spanish card to the favorit game of treinta uno a sort of
spanish everlast i left them and went out to take up my bivouack
among the hide it wa now dark the vessel wa hidden from sight
and except the three men in the hous there wa not a live soul
within a leagu the coati a wild anim of a natur and appear
between that of the fox and the wolf set up their sharp quick bark
and two owl at the end of two distant point run out into the
bai on differ side of the hill where i lai kept up their
altern dismal note i had heard the sound befor at night but did
not know what it wa until on of the men who came down to look at my
quarter told me it wa the owl mellow by the distanc and heard
alon at night i thought it wa the most melancholi bode sound i
had ever heard through nearli all the night thei kept it up
answer on anoth slowli at regular interv thi wa reliev
by the noisi coati some of which came quit near to my quarter and
were not veri pleasant neighbor the next morn befor sunris
the longboat came ashor and the hide were taken off
we lai at san pedro about a week engag in take off hide and in
other labor which had now becom our regular duti i spent on more
dai on the hill watch a quantiti of hide and good and thi time
succeed in find a part of a volum of scott pirat in a corner
of the hous but it fail me at a most interest moment and i
betook myself to my acquaint on shore and from them learn a
good deal about the custom of the countri the harbor etc thi
thei told me wa a wors harbor than santa barbara for southeast
the bear of the headland be a point and a half more to windward
and it be so shallow that the sea broke often as far out as where we
lai at anchor the gale from which we slip at santa barbara had
been so bad a on here that the whole bai for a leagu out wa
fill with the foam of the breaker and sea actual broke over the
dead man island the lagoda wa ly there and slip at the
first alarm and in such hast that she wa oblig to leav her launch
behind her at anchor the littl boat rode it out for sever hour
pitch at her anchor and stand with her stern up almost
perpendicularli the men told me that thei watch her till toward
night when she snap her cabl and drove up over the breaker high
and dry upon the beach
on board the pilgrim everyth went on regularli each on try to
get along as smoothli as possibl but the comfort of the voyag wa
evid at an end that is a long lane which ha no
turningeveri dog must have hi dai and mine will come
byandbyand the like proverb were occasion quot but no on
spoke of ani probabl end to the voyag or of boston or anyth of
the kind or if he did it wa onli to draw out the perpetu surli
repli from hi shipmateboston is it you mai thank your star if
you ever see that place you had better have your back sheath and
your head copper and your feet shod and make out your log for
california for life or els someth of thi kindbefor you get
to boston the hide will wear the hair off your head and youll take
up all your wage in cloth and wont have enough left to bui a wig
with
the flog wa seldom if ever allud to by us in the forecastl if
ani on wa inclin to talk about it the other with a delicaci
which i hardli expect to find among them alwai stop him or
turn the subject but the behavior of the two men who were flog
toward on anoth show a delicaci and a sens of honor which would
have been worthi of admir in the highest walk of life sam knew
that the other had suffer sole on hi account and in all hi
complaint he said that if he alon had been flog it would have
been noth but that he never could see that man without think
what had been the mean of bring that disgrac upon him and john
never by word or deed let anyth escap him to remind the other
that it wa by interf to save hi shipmat that he had suffer
have got all our spare room fill with hide we hove up our anchor
and made sail for san diego in no oper can the disposit of a
crew be discov better than in get under weigh
where thing ar done with a will everi on is like a cat aloft
sail ar loos in an instant each on lai out hi strength on hi
handspik and the windlass goe briskli round with the loud cry of yo
heav ho heav and pawl heav hearti ho but with us at thi time
it wa all drag work no on went aloft beyond hi ordinari gait
and the chain came slowli in over the windlass the mate between the

cheerili said the mate but there wa no cheerili for us and we
did without it the captain walk the quarterdeck and said not a
word he must have seen the chang but there wa noth which he
could notic offici
we sail leisur down the coast befor a light fair wind keep
the land well aboard and saw two other mission look like block
of white plaster shine in the distanc on of which situat on
the top of a high hill wa san juan campestrano under which vessel
sometim come to anchor in the summer season and take off hide the
most distant on wa st loui rei which the third mate said wa onli
fifteen mile from san diego at sunset on the second dai we had a
larg and well wood headland directli befor us behind which lai the
littl harbor of san diego we were becalm off thi point all night
but the next morn which wa saturdai the 14th of march have a
good breez we stood round the point and haul our wind brought
the littl harbor which is rather the outlet of a small river right
befor us everi on wa anxiou to get a view of the new place a
chain of high hill begin at the point which wa on our larboard
hand come in protect the harbor on the north and west and ran
off into the interior as far as the ey could reach on the other
side the land wa low and green but without tree the entranc is

libertydai on shore
the next dai be sundai after wash and clear deck and
get breakfast the mate came forward with leav for on watch to go
ashor on liberti we drew lot and it fell to the larboard which i
wa in instantli all wa prepar bucket of fresh water which
we were allow in port and soap were put in us goashor jacket
and trowser got out and brush pump neckerchief and hat
overhaul on lend to anoth so that among the whole each on
got a good fitout a boat wa call to pull the liberti men
ashor and we sat down in the stern sheet as big as pai
passeng and jump ashor set out on our walk for the town
which wa nearli three mile off
it is a piti that some other arrang is not made in merchant
vessel with regard to the libertydai when in port the crew ar
kept at work all the week and the onli dai thei ar allow for rest
or pleasur is the sabbath and unless thei go ashor on that dai thei
cannot go at all i have heard of a religi captain who gave hi
crew liberti on saturdai after twelv oclock thi would be a good
plan if shipmast would bring themselv to give their crew so much
time for young sailor especi mani of whom have been brought up
with a regard for the sacred of the dai thi strong temptat to
break it is exceedingli injuri as it is it can hardli be expect
that a crew on a long and hard voyag will refus a few hour of
freedom from toil and the restraint of a vessel and an opportun to
tread the ground and see the sight of societi and human becaus it
is on a sundai it is too much like escap from prison or be
drawn out of a pit on the sabbath dai
i shall never forget the delight sensat of be in the open air
with the bird sing around me and escap from the confin
labor and strict rule of a vesselof be onc more in my life
though onli for a dai my own master a sailor liberti is but for a
dai yet while it last it is perfect he is under no on ey and
can do whatev and go wherev he pleas thi dai for the first
time i mai truli sai in my whole life i felt the mean of a term
which i had often heardth sweet of liberti my friend s wa
with me and turn our back upon the vessel we walk slowli
along talk of the pleasur of be our own master of the time
past and when we were free in the midst of friend in america and of
the prospect of our return and plan where we would go and what we
would do when we reach home it wa wonder how the prospect
brighten and how short and toler the voyag appear when
view in thi new light thing look differ from what thei did
when we talk them over in the littl dark forecastl the night after
the flog at san pedro it is not the least of the advantag of
allow sailor occasion a dai of liberti that it give them a
spring and make them feel cheer and independ and lead them
insens to look on the bright side of everyth for some time after
s and myself determin to keep as much togeth as possibl
though we knew that it would not do to cut our shipmat for know
our birth and educ thei were a littl suspici that we would
try to put on the gentleman when we got ashor and would be asham of
their compani and thi wont do with jack when the voyag is at an
end you mai do as you pleas but so long as you belong to the same
vessel you must be a shipmat to him on shore or he will not be a
shipmat to you on board be forewarn of thi befor i went to
sea i took no long tog with me and be dress like the rest in
white duck trowser blue jacket and straw hat which would prevent my
go in better compani and show no disposit to avoid them i
set all suspicion at rest our crew fell in with some who belong to
the other vessel and sailorlik steer for the first grogshop
thi wa a small mud build of onli on room in which were liquor
dry and west india good shoe bread fruit and everyth which is
vendibl in california it wa kept by a yanke a oneei man who
belong formerli to fall river came out to the pacif in a
whaleship left her at the sandwich island and came to california
and set up a pulperia s and i follow in our shipmat wake
know that to refus to drink with them would be the highest affront
but determin to slip awai at the first opportun it is the
univers custom with sailor for each on in hi turn to treat the
whole call for a glass all round and oblig everi on who is
present even the keeper of the shop to take a glass with him when
we first came in there wa some disput between our crew and the
other whether the new comer or the old california ranger should
treat first but it be settl in favor of the latter each of the
crew of the other vessel treat all round in their turn and as
there were a good mani present includ some loafer who had
drop in know what wa go on to take advantag of jack
hospit and the liquor wa a real 12 cent a glass it made
somewhat of a hole in their locker it wa now our ship turn and
s and i anxiou to get awai step up to call for glass but
we soon found that we must go in orderth oldest first for the old
sailor did not choos to be preced by a coupl of youngster and
bon gr mal gr we had to wait our turn with the twofold apprehens
of be too late for our hors and of get corn for drink you
must everi time and if you drink with on and not with anoth it is
alwai taken as an insult

the next sound we heard wa all hand ahoi and look up the
scuttl saw that it wa just daylight our liberti had now truli
taken flight and with it we laid awai our pump stock blue
jacket neckerchief and other goashor paraphernalia and put
on old duck trowser red shirt and scotch cap began take out and
land our hide for three dai we were hard at work from the grei
of the morn until starlight with the except of a short time
allow for meal in thi duti for land and take on board hide
san diego is decidedli the best place in california the harbor is
small and landlock there is no surf the vessel lie within a
cabl length of the beach and the beach itself is smooth hard sand
without rock or stone for these reason it is us by all the
vessel in the trade as a depot and inde it would be imposs
when load with the cure hide for the passag home to take them on
board at ani of the open port without get them wet in the surf
which would spoil them we took possess of on of the hidehous
which belong to our firm and had been us by the california it wa
built to hold forti thousand hide and we had the pleas prospect of
fill it befor we could leav the coast and toward thi our
thirtyf hundr which we brought down with us would do but
littl there wa not a man on board who did not go a dozen time into
the hous and look round and make some calcul of the time it
would requir
the hide as thei come rough and uncur from the vessel ar pile
up outsid of the hous whenc thei ar taken and carri through a
regular process of pickl dry clean etc and stow awai in
the hous readi to be put on board thi process is necessari in
order that thei mai keep dure a long voyag and in warm latitud
for the purpos of cure and take care of these hide an offic
and a part of the crew of each vessel ar usual left ashor and it
wa for thi busi we found that our new offic had join us
as soon as the hide were land he took charg of the hous and the
captain intend to leav two or three of us with him hire sandwich
island to take our place on board but he could not get ani
sandwich island to go though he offer them fifteen dollar a
month for the report of the flog had got among them and he wa
call aol maikai no good and that wa an end of the busi
thei were howev will to work on shore and four of them were
hire and put with mr russel to cure the hide
after land our hide we next sent ashor all our spare spar and
rig all the store which we did not want to us in the cours of
on trip to windward and in fact everyth which we could spare so
as to make room for hide among other thing the pigsti and with it
old bess thi wa an old sow that we had brought from boston and
which live to get around cape horn where all the other pig di from
cold and wet report said that she had been a canton voyag befor
she had been the pet of the cook dure the whole passag and he had
fed her with the best of everyth and taught her to know hi voic
and to do a number of strang trick for hi amus tom cringl
sai that no on can fathom a negro affect for a pig and i
believ he is right for it almost broke our poor darki heart when he
heard that bess wa to be taken ashor and that he wa to have the
care of her no more dure the whole voyag he had depend upon her
as a solac dure the long trip up and down the coast obei order
if you break owner said he break heart he meant to have said
and lent a hand to get her over the side try to make it as easi for
her as possibl we got a whip up on the mainyard and hook it to
a strap around her bodi swai awai and give a wink to on anoth
ran her chock up to the yard vast there vast said the mate
none of your skylark lower awai but he evid enjoi the
joke the pig squeal like the crack of doom and tear stood in
the poor darki ey and he mutter someth about have no piti
on a dumb beast dumb beast said jack if she what you call a
dumb beast then my ey ant mate thi produc a laugh from all
but the cook he wa too intent upon see her safe in the boat he
watch her all the wai ashor where upon her land she wa
receiv by a whole troop of her kind who had been sent ashor from
the other vessel and had multipli and form a larg commonwealth
from the door of hi gallei the cook us to watch them in their
manoeuvr set up a shout and clap hi hand whenev bess
came off victori in the struggl for piec of raw hide and
halfpick bone which were ly about the beach dure the dai he
save all the nice thing and made a bucket of swill and ask us to
take it ashor in the gig and look quit disconcert when the mate
told him that he would pitch the swill overboard and him after it if
he saw ani of it go into the boat we told him that he thought more
about the pig than he did about hi wife who live down in robinson
allei and inde he could hardli have been more attent for he
actual on sever night after dark when he thought he would not
be seen scull himself ashor in a boat with a bucket of nice swill
and return like leander from cross the hellespont
the next sundai the other half of our crew went ashor on liberti and
left us on board to enjoi the first quiet sundai which we had had upon
the coast here were no hide to come off and no southeast to
fear we wash and mend our cloth in the morn and spent the
rest of the dai in read and write sever of us wrote letter to

heav at a windlass in order that thei mai heav togeth alwai
have on to sing out which is done in a peculiar high and longdrawn
note vari with the motion of the windlass thi requir a high
voic strong lung and much practic to be done well thi fellow
had a veri peculiar wild sort of note break occasion into a
falsetto the sailor thought it wa too high and not enough of the
boatswain hoars about it but to me it had a great charm the
harbor wa perfectli still and hi voic rang among the hill as
though it could have been heard for mile toward sundown a good
breez have sprung up she got under weigh and with her long sharp
head cut elegantli through the water on a taut bowlin she
stood directli out of the harbor and bore awai to the southward she
wa bound to callao and thenc to the sandwich island and expect
to be on the coast again in eight or ten month
at the close of the week we were readi to sail but were delai a dai

few blow over the back with a rope end and sent him forward he wa
not much hurt but a good deal frighten and made up hi mind to run

to find f of cours we would tell noth and all thei could
discov wa that he had left an empti chest behind him and that he
went off in a boat for thei saw it ly up high and dry on the beach
after breakfast the captain went up to the town and offer a reward
of twenti dollar for him and for a coupl of dai the soldier
indian and all other who had noth to do were scour the

with captain bradshaw to take him on board the ship just behind the
hidehous among the thicket and underwood wa a small cave the
entranc to which wa known onli to two men on the beach and which wa
so well conceal that though when i afterward came to live on
shore it wa shown to me two or three time i wa never abl to find
it alon to thi cave he wa carri befor daybreak in the morn
and suppli with bread and water and there remain until he saw us
under weigh and well round the point
fridai march 27th the captain have given up all hope of find
f and be unwil to delai ani longer gave order for
unmoor the ship and we made sail drop slowli down with the
tide and light wind we left letter with captain bradshaw to take to
boston and had the satisfact of hear him sai that he should be
back again befor we left the coast the wind which wa veri light
di awai soon after we doubl the point and we lai becalm for two
dai not move three mile the whole time and a part of the second
dai were almost within sight of the vessel on the third dai about
noon a cool seabreez came rippl and darken the surfac of the
water and by sundown we were off san juan which is about forti
mile from san diego and is call half wai to san pedro where we
were now bound our crew wa now consider weaken on man we had
lost overboard anoth had been taken aft as clerk and a third had
run awai so that besid s and myself there were onli three abl
seamen and on boi of twelv year of ag with thi diminish and
discont crew and in a small vessel we were now to battl the
watch through a coupl of year of hard servic yet there wa not on
who wa not glad that f had escap for shiftless and good for
noth as he wa no on could wish to see him drag on a miser
life cow down and dishearten and we were all rejoic to hear
upon our return to san diego about two month afterward that he had
been immedi taken aboard the lagoda and went home in her on
regular seaman wage
after a slow passag of five dai we arriv on wednesdai the first
of april at our old anchor ground at san pedro the bai wa as
desert and look as dreari as befor and form no pleas
contrast with the secur and snug of san diego and the activ
and interest which the load and unload of four vessel gave to
that scene in a few dai the hide began to come slowli down and we
got into the old busi of roll good up the hill pitch hide
down and pull our long leagu off and on noth of note occur
while we were ly here except that an attempt wa made to repair the
small mexican brig which had been cast awai in a southeast and
which now lai up high and dry over on reef of rock and two
sandbank our carpent survei her and pronounc her capabl of
refit and in a few dai the owner came down from the pueblo and
wait for the high spring tide with the help of our cabl kedg
and crew got her off and afloat after sever trial the three men
at the hous on shore who had formerli been a part of her crew now
join her and seem glad enough at the prospect of get off the
coast
on board our own vessel thing went on in the common monoton wai
the excit which immedi follow the flog scene had pass
off but the effect of it upon the crew and especi upon the two
men themselv remain the differ manner in which these men were
affect correspond to their differ charact wa not a littl
remark john wa a foreign and hightemp and though
mortifi as ani on would be at have had the worst of an encount
yet hi chief feel seem to be anger and he talk much of
satisfact and reveng if he ever got back to boston but with the
other it wa veri differ he wa an american and had had some
educ and thi thing come upon him seem complet to break
him down he had a feel of the degrad that had been inflict
upon him which the other man wa incap of befor that he had a
good deal of fun and muse us often with queer negro storiesh wa
from a slave state but afterward he seldom smile seem to lose
all life and elast and appear to have but on wish and that
wa for the voyag to be at an end i have often known him to draw a
long sigh when he wa alon and he took but littl part or interest in
john plan of satisfact and retali
after a stai of about a fortnight dure which we slip for on
southeast and were at sea two dai we got under weigh for santa
barbara it wa now the middl of april and the southeast season
wa nearli over and the light regular tradewind which blow down
the coast began to set steadili in dure the latter part of each

all dress in their best the men ride about on horseback among the
hous and the women sit on carpet befor the door under the
piazza of a pulperia two men were seat deck out with knot of
ribbon and bouquet and plai the violin and the spanish guitar

trumpet at monterei that i ever heard in california and i suspect
thei plai upon no other for at a great fandango at which i wa
afterward present and where thei muster all the music thei could
find there were three violin and two guitar and no other
instrument as it wa now too near the middl of the dai to see ani
danc and hear that a bull wa expect down from the countri to
be bait in the presidio squar in the cours of an hour or two we
took a stroll among the hous inquir for an american who we had
been told had marri in the place and kept a shop we were direct
to a long low build at the end of which wa a door with a sign
over it in spanish enter the shop we found no on in it and the

daughter die the other dai and that the custom of the countri
here i felt a littl strang not know what to sai or whether to
offer consol or no and wa begin to retir when he open a
side door and told us to walk in here i wa no less astonish for i
found a larg room fill with young girl from three or four year
of ag up to fifteen and sixteen dress all in white with wreath of
flower on their head and bouquet in their hand follow our
conductor through all these girl who were plai about in high
spirit we came to a tabl at the end of the room cover with a
white cloth on which lai a coffin about three feet long with the
bodi of hi child the coffin wa line on the outsid with white
cloth and on the insid with white satin and wa strew with
flower through an open door we saw in anoth room a few elderli
peopl in common dress while the bench and tabl thrown up in a
corner and the stain wall gave evid sign of the last night
high go feel like garrick between tragedi and comedi an
uncertainti of purpos and a littl awkward i ask the man when
the funer would take place and be told that it would move toward
the mission in about an hour took my leav
to pass awai the time we took hors and rode down to the beach and
there found three or four italian sailor mount and ride up and
down on the hard sand at a furiou rate we join them and found
it fine sport the beach gave us a stretch of a mile or more and the
hors flew over the smooth hard sand appar invigor and
excit by the salt seabreez and by the continu roar and dash
of the breaker from the beach we return to the town and find
that the funer process had move rode on and overtook it about
halfwai to the mission here wa as peculiar a sight as we had seen
befor in the hous the on look as much like a funer process
as the other did like a hous of mourn the littl coffin wa born
by eight girl who were continu reliev by other run
forward from the process and take their place behind it came a
straggl compani of girl dress as befor in white and flower
and includ i should suppos by their number nearli all the girl

frequent stop and run all togeth to talk to some on or to
pick up a flower and then run on again to overtak the coffin
there were a few elderli women in common color and a herd of young
men and boi some on foot and other mount follow them or walk
or rode by their side frequent interrupt them by joke and
question but the most singular thing of all wa that two men walk
on on each side of the coffin carri musket in their hand which
thei continu load and fire into the air whether thi wa to
keep off the evil spirit or not i do not know it wa the onli
interpret that i could put upon it
as we drew near the mission we saw the great gate thrown open and the
pdre stand on the step with a crucifix in hand the mission is a
larg and desertedlook place the outbuild go to ruin and
everyth give on the impress of decai grandeur a larg
stone fountain threw out pure water from four mouth into a basin
befor the church door and we were on the point of ride up to let
our hors drink when it occur to us that it might be consecr

italian sailor danc and on of our crew exhibit himself in a sort
of west india shuffl much to the amus of the bystand who

the style of danc but although we had had our own wai dure the
dai yet we were after all but foremast jack and have been
order to be on the beach by sundown did not ventur to be more than
an hour behind the time so we took our wai down we found the boat
just pull ashor through the breaker which were run high
there have been a heavi fog outsid which from some caus or other
alwai bring on or preced a heavi sea libertymen ar privileg
from the time thei leav the vessel until thei step on board again so
we took our place in the stern sheet and were congratul
ourselv upon get off dry when a great comber broke fore and aft
the boat and wet us through and through fill the boat half full of
water have lost her buoyanc by the weight of the water she
drop heavili into everi sea that struck her and by the time we had
pull out of the surf into deep water she wa but just afloat and we
were up to our knee by the help of a small bucket and our hat we
bail her out got on board hoist the boat eat our supper
chang our cloth gave as is usual the whole histori of our dai
adventur to those who had staid on board and have taken a

on mondai morn as an offset to our dai sport we were all set to
work tar down the rig some got girtlin up for ride
down the stai and backstai and other tar the shroud lift
etc lai out on the yard and come down the rig we
overhaul our bag and took out our old tarri trowser and frock
which we had us when we tar down befor and were all at work in
the rig by sunris after breakfast we had the satisfact of
see the italian ship boat go ashor fill with men gaili
dress as on the dai befor and sing their barcarolla the
easter holydai ar kept up on shore dure three dai and be a
cathol vessel the crew had the advantag of them for two
success dai while perch up in the rig cover with tar and
engag in our disagre work we saw these fellow go ashor in
the morn and come off again at night in high spirit so much
for be protest there no danger of catholic spread in
new england yanke cant afford the time to be cathol american
shipmast get nearli three week more labor out of their crew in
the cours of a year than the master of vessel from cathol
countri yanke dont keep christma and shipmast at sea never
know when thanksgiv come so jack ha no festiv at all
about noon a man aloft call out sail ho and look round we saw
the head sail of a vessel come round the point as she drew round
she show the broadsid of a fullrig brig with the yanke ensign
at her peak we ran up our star and stripe and know that there
wa no american brig on the coast but ourselv expect to have new
from home she roundedto and let go her anchor but the dark face on
her yard when thei furl the sail and the babel on deck soon made
known that she wa from the island immedi afterward a boat
crew came aboard bring her skipper and from them we learn that
she wa from oahu and wa engag in the same trade with the ayacucho
loriott etc between the coast the sandwich island and the
leeward coast of peru and chili her captain and offic were
american and also a part of her crew the rest were island she
wa call the catalina and like all the other vessel in that
trade except the ayacucho her paper and color were from uncl sam
thei of cours brought us no new and we were doubli disappoint
for we had thought at first it might be the ship which we were
expect from boston
after ly here about a fortnight and collect all the hide the
place afford we set sail again for san pedro there we found the
brig which we had assist in get off ly at anchor with a mix
crew of american english sandwich island spaniard and spanish
indian and though much smaller than we yet she had three time the
number of men and she need them for her offic were californian
no vessel in the world go so poorli man as american and english
and none do so well a yanke brig of that size would have had a crew
of four men and would have work round and round her the italian
ship had a crew of thirti men nearli three time as mani as the alert
which wa afterward on the coast and wa of the same size yet the
alert would get under weigh and cometo in half the time and get two
anchor while thei were all talk at oncejabb like a parcel
of yahoo and run about deck to find their catblock
there wa onli on point in which thei had the advantag over us and
that wa in lighten their labor in the boat by their song the
american ar a time and monei save peopl but have not yet as a
nation learn that music mai be turn to account we pull the
long distanc to and from the shore with our load boat without a
word spoken and with discont look while thei not onli lighten
the labor of row but actual made it pleasant and cheer by
their music so true is it that
for the tire slave song lift the languid oar
and bid it aptli fall with chime
that beautifi the fairest shore
and mitig the harshest clime
we lai about a week in san pedro and got under weigh for san diego
intend to stop at san juan as the southeast season wa nearli
over and there wa littl or no danger
thi be the spring season san pedro as well as all the other open
port upon the coast wa fill with whale that had come in to make
their annual visit upon sound for the first few dai that we were
here and at santa barbara we watch them with great interestcal
out there she blow everi time we saw the spout of on break the
surfac of the water but thei soon becam so common that we took
littl notic of them thei often broke veri near us and on thick
foggi night dure a dead calm while i wa stand anchorwatch on
of them rose so near that he struck our cabl and made all surg
again he did not seem to like the encount much himself for he
sheer off and spout at a good distanc we onc came veri near
run on down in the gig and should probabl have been knock to
piec and blown skyhigh we had been on board the littl spanish
brig and were return stretch out well at our oar the littl
boat go like a swallow our back were forward as is alwai the
case in pull and the captain who wa steer wa not look
ahead when all at onc we heard the spout of a whale directli ahead
back water back water for your live shout the captain and we
back our blade in the water and brought the boat to in a smother of
foam turn our head we saw a great rough humpback whale
slowli cross our fore foot within three or four yard of the boat
stem had we not back water just as we did we should inevit
have gone smash upon him strike him with our stem just about
amidship he took no notic of us but pass slowli on and dive a
few yard beyond us throw hi tail high in the air he wa so near
that we had a perfect view of him and as mai be suppos had no desir
to see him nearer he wa a disgust creatur with a skin rough
hairi and of an irongrei color thi kind differ much from the
sperm in color and skin and is said to be fiercer we saw a few
sperm whale but most of the whale that come upon the coast ar
finback humpback and rightwhal which ar more difficult to
take and ar said not to give oil enough to pai for the troubl for
thi reason whaleship do not come upon the coast after them our
captain togeth with captain nye of the loriott who had been in a
whaleship thought of make an attempt upon on of them with two
boat crew but as we had onli two harpoon and no proper line thei
gave it up
dure the month of march april and mai these whale appear in
great number in the open port of santa barbara san pedro etc and
hover off the coast while a few find their wai into the close harbor
of san diego and monterei thei ar all off again befor midsumm
and make their appear on the offshor ground we saw some fine
school of sperm whale which ar easili distinguish by their
spout blow awai a few mile to windward on our passag to san
juan
coast along on the quiet shore of the pacif we came to anchor in
twenti fathom water almost out at sea as it were and directli
abreast of a steep hill which overhung the water and wa twice as high
as our royalmasthead we had heard much of thi place from the
lagoda crew who said it wa the worst place in california the shore
is rocki and directli expos to the southeast so that vessel ar
oblig to slip and run for their live on the first sign of a gale
and late as it wa in the season we got up our sliprop and gear
though we meant to stai onli twentyfour hour we pull the agent
ashor and were order to wait for him while he took a circuit
wai round the hill to the mission which wa hidden behind it we were
glad of the opportun to examin thi singular place and haul the
boat up and make her well fast took differ direct up and down
the beach to explor it
san juan is the onli romant spot in california the countri here for
sever mile is high tableland run boldli to the shore and
break off in a steep hill at the foot of which the water of the
pacif ar constantli dash for sever mile the water wash the
veri base of the hill or break upon ledg and fragment of rock
which run out into the sea just where we land wa a small cove or
bight which gave us at high tide a few squar feet of sandbeach
between the sea and the bottom of the hill thi wa the onli
landingplac directli befor us rose the perpendicular height of
four or five hundr feet how we were to get hide down or good up
upon the tableland on which the mission wa situat wa more than we
could tell the agent had taken a long circuit and yet had frequent
to jump over break and climb up steep place in the ascent no
anim but a man or monkei could get up it howev that wa not our
lookout and know that the agent would be gone an hour or more we
stroll about pick up shell and follow the sea where it
tumbl in roar and spout among the crevic of the great
rock what a sight thought i must thi be in a southeast the
rock were as larg as those of nahant or newport but to my ey more
grand and broken besid there wa a grandeur in everyth around
which gave almost a solemn to the scene a silenc and solitari
which affect everyth not a human be but ourselv for mile
and no sound heard but the pulsat of the great pacif and the
great steep hill rise like a wall and cut us off from all the
world but the world of water i separ myself from the rest and
sat down on a rock just where the sea ran in and form a fine
spout horn compar with the plain dull sandbeach of the rest of
the coast thi grandeur wa as refresh as a great rock in a weari
land it wa almost the first time that i had been posit
alonefre from the sens that human be were at my elbow if not
talk with mesinc i had left home my better natur return
strong upon me everyth wa in accord with my state of feel
and i experienc a glow of pleasur at find that what of poetri and
romanc i ever had in me had not been entir deaden by the
labori and fritter life i had led nearli an hour did i sit
almost lost in the luxuri of thi entir new scene of the plai in which
i had been so long act when i wa arous by the distant shout of
my companion and saw that thei were collect togeth as the agent
had made hi appear on hi wai back to our boat
we pull aboard and found the longboat hoist out and nearli laden
with good and after dinner we all went on shore in the quarterboat
with the longboat in tow as we drew in we found an oxcart and a
coupl of men stand directli on the brow of the hill and have
land the captain took hi wai round the hill order me and on
other to follow him we follow pick our wai out and jump and
scrambl up walk over brier and prickli pear until we came to
the top here the countri stretch out for mile as far as the ey
could reach on a level tabl surfac and the onli habit in
sight wa the small white mission of san juan capistrano with a few
indian hut about it stand in a small hollow about a mile from
where we were reach the brow of the hill where the cart stood we
found sever pile of hide and indian sit round them on or
two other cart were come slowli on from the mission and the captain
told us to begin and throw the hide down thi then wa the wai
thei were to be got down thrown down on at a time a distanc of
four hundr feet thi wa do the busi on a great scale
stand on the edg of the hill and look down the perpendicular
height the sailor
that walk upon the beach
appear like mice and our tall anchor bark
diminish to her cock her cock a buoi
almost too small for sight
down thi height we pitch the hide throw them as far out into
the air as we could and as thei were all larg stiff and doubl
like the cover of a book the wind took them and thei swai and
eddi about plung and rise in the air like a kite when it ha
broken it string as it wa now low tide there wa no danger of
their fall into the water and as fast as thei came to ground the
men below pick them up and take them on their head walk off
with them to the boat it wa realli a picturesqu sight the great
height the scale of the hide and the continu walk to and fro
of the men who look like mite on the beach thi wa the romanc
of hidedrogh
some of the hide lodg in caviti which were under the bank and out
of our sight be directli under us but by send other down in
the same direct we succeed in dislodg them had thei remain
there the captain said he should have sent on board for a coupl of
pair of long halyard and got some on to have gone down for them
it wa said that on of the crew of an english brig went down in the
same wai a few year befor we look over and thought it would not
be a welcom task especi for a few paltri hide but no on know
what he can do until he is call upon for six month afterward i
went down the same place by a pair of topgal studdingsail
halyard to save a half a dozen hide which had lodg there

nichola wa the most immens man that i had ever seen in my life he
came on the coast in a vessel which wa afterward wreck and now let
himself out to the differ hous to cure hide he wa consider
over six feet and of a frame so larg that he might have been shown
for a curios but the most remark thing about him wa hi feet
thei were so larg that he could not find a pair of shoe in california
to fit him and wa oblig to send to oahu for a pair and when he got
them he wa compel to wear them down at the heel he told me onc
himself that he wa wreck in an american brig on the goodwin sand

knew how to read nor write he had been to sea from a boi and had
seen all kind of servic and been in everi kind of vessel

gather from hi account of himself and from what he onc told me in
confid after we had becom better acquaint he had even been in
wors busi than slavetrad he wa onc tri for hi life in
charleston south carolina and though acquit yet he wa so
frighten that he never would show himself in the unit state again
and i could not persuad him that he could never be tri a second time
for the same offenc he said he had got safe off from the breaker
and wa too good a sailor to risk hi timber again
though i knew what hi life had been yet i never had the slightest
fear of him we alwai got along veri well togeth and though so
much stronger and larger than i he show a respect for my educ
and for what he had heard of my situat befor come to sea ill

togeth we kept the offic in good order for he wa evid
afraid of nichola and never order us except when emploi upon the
hide my other companion the sandwich island deserv particular
notic
a consider trade ha been carri on for sever year between
california and the sandwich island and most of the vessel ar man
with island who as thei for the most part sign no articl
leav whenev thei choos and let themselv out to cure hide at san
diego and to suppli the place of the men of the american vessel
while on the coast in thi wai quit a coloni of them had becom
settl at san diego as their headquart some of these had recent
gone off in the ayacucho and loriott and the pilgrim had taken mr
mannini and three other so that there were not more than twenti left
of these four were on pai at the ayacucho hous four more work
with us and the rest were live at the oven in a quiet wai for their
monei wa nearli gone and thei must make it last until some other
vessel came down to emploi them
dure the four month that i live here i got well acquaint with
all of them and took the greatest pain to becom familiar with their
languag habit and charact their languag i could onli learn
oral for thei had not ani book among them though mani of them had
been taught to read and write by the missionari at home thei spoke
a littl english and by a sort of compromis a mix languag wa
us on the beach which could be understood by all the long name of
sandwich island is drop and thei ar call by the white all
over the pacif ocean kanka from a word in their own languag
which thei appli to themselv and to all south sea island in
distinct from white whom thei call haol thi name kanaka
thei answer to both collect and individu their proper
name in their own languag be difficult to pronounc and
rememb thei ar call by ani name which the captain or crew mai
choos to give them some ar call after the vessel thei ar in
other by common name as jack tom bill and some have fanci name
as banyan foretop ropeyarn pelican etc etc of the four who
work at our hous on wa name mr bingham after the missionari
at oahu anoth hope after a vessel that he had been in a third
tom davi the name of hi first captain and the fourth pelican from
hi fanci resembl to that bird then there wa lagodajack
californiabil etc etc but by whatev name thei might be
call thei were the most interest intellig and kindheart
peopl that i ever fell in with i felt a posit attach for
almost all of them and mani of them i have to thi time a feel
for which would lead me to go a great wai for the mere pleasur of
see them and which will alwai make me feel a strong interest in
the mere name of a sandwich island
tom davi knew how to read write and cipher in common arithmet had
been to the unit state and spoke english quit well hi educ
wa as good as that of threequart of the yanke in california and
hi manner and principl a good deal better and he wa so quick of
apprehens that he might have been taught navig and the
element of mani of the scienc with the most perfect eas old mr
bingham spoke veri littl englishalmost none and neither knew how
to read nor write but he wa the bestheart old fellow in the world
he must have been over fifti year of ag and had two of hi front
teeth knock out which wa done by hi parent as a sign of grief at
the death of kamehameha the great king of the sandwich island we
us to tell him that he at captain cook and lost hi teeth in that
wai that wa the onli thing that ever made him angri he would
alwai be quit excit at that and sayaol no me no eat

captain cook for the sailor all believ that he wa eaten and that
thei cannot endur to be taunt withnew zealand kanaka eat white

haoleal e same a you
mr bingham wa a sort of patriarch among them and wa alwai treat
with great respect though he had not the educ and energi which
gave mr mannini hi power over them i have spent hour in talk
with thi old fellow about kamehameha the charlemagn of the sandwich
island hi son and successor riho riho who di in england and wa
brought to oahu in the frigat blond captain lord byron and whose
funer he rememb perfectli and also about the custom of hi
countri in hi boyhood and the chang which had been made by the
missionari he never would allow that human be had been eaten
there and inde it alwai seem like an insult to tell so
affection intellig and civil a class of men that such
barbar had been practis in their own countri within the
recollect of mani of them certainli the histori of no peopl on
the globe can show anyth like so rapid an advanc i would have
trust my life and my fortun in the hand of ani on of these peopl
and certainli had i wish for a favor or act of sacrific i would
have gone to them all in turn befor i should have appli to on of
my own countrymen on the coast and should have expect to have seen
it done befor my own countrymen had got half through count the
cost their costum and manner of treat on anoth show a
simpl primit generos which is truli delight and which is
often a reproach to our own peopl whatev on ha thei all have
monei food cloth thei share with on anoth even to the last
piec of tobacco to put in their pipe i onc heard old mr bingham
sai with the highest indign to a yanke trader who wa try to
persuad him to keep hi monei to himselfno we no all e same a
yousuppos on got monei all got monei yousuppos on got
moneylock him up in chestno goodkanaka all e same a on
thi principl thei carri so far that none of them will eat anyth
in the sight of other without offer it all round i have seen on
of them break a biscuit which had been given him into five part at
a time when i knew he wa on a veri short allow as there wa but
littl to eat on the beach
my favorit among all of them and on who wa like by both offic
and men and by whomev he had anyth to do with wa hope he wa
an intellig kindheart littl fellow and i never saw him angri
though i knew him for more than a year and have seen him impos upon
by white peopl and abus by insol offic of vessel he wa
alwai civil and alwai readi and never forgot a benefit i onc
took care of him when he wa ill get medicin from the ship
chest when no captain or offic would do anyth for him and he
never forgot it everi kanaka ha on particular friend whom he
consid himself bound to do everyth for and with whom he ha a
sort of contractan allianc offens and defensiveand for whom
he will often make the greatest sacrific thi friend thei call
aikan and for such did hope adopt me i do not believ i could have
want anyth which he had that he would not have given me in
return for thi i wa alwai hi friend among the american and us
to teach him letter and number for he left home befor he had
learn how to read he wa veri curiou about boston as thei call
the unit state ask mani question about the hous the peopl
etc and alwai wish to have the pictur in book explain to him
thei were all astonishingli quick in catch at explan and mani
thing which i had thought it utterli imposs to make them
understand thei often seiz in an instant and ask question which
show that thei knew enough to make them wish to go farther the
pictur of steamboat and railroad car in the column of some
newspap which i had gave me great difficulti to explain the
grade of the road the rail the construct of the carriag thei
could easili understand but the motion produc by steam wa a littl
too refin for them i attempt to show it to them onc by an
experi upon the cook copper but fail probabl as much from
my own ignor as from their want of apprehens and i have no
doubt left them with about as clear an idea of the principl as i had
myself thi difficulti of cours exist in the same forc with the
steamboat and all i could do wa to give them some account of the
result in the shape of speed for fail in the reason i had to
fall back upon the fact in my account of the speed i wa support by
tom who had been to nantucket and seen a littl steamboat which ran
over to new bedford
a map of the world which i onc show them kept their attent for
hour those who knew how to read point out the place and refer
to me for the distanc i rememb be much amus with a question
which hope ask me point to the larg irregular place which is
alwai left blank round the pole to denot that it is undiscov
he look up and askedpau done end
the system of name the street and number the hous thei easili
understood and the util of it thei had a great desir to see
america but were afraid of doubl cape horn for thei suffer much in
cold weather and had heard dread account of the cape from those
of their number who had been round it
thei smoke a great deal though not much at a time us pipe with
larg bowl and veri short stem or no stem at all these thei
light and put them to their mouth take a long draught get
their mouth as full as thei can hold and their cheek distend and
then let it slowli out through their mouth and nostril the pipe is
then pass to other who draw in the same manner on pipeful
serv for half a dozen thei never take short continu draught
like european but on of these oahu puff as the sailor call
them serv for an hour or two until some on els light hi pipe
and it is pass round in the same manner each kanaka on the beach had
a pipe flint steel tinder a hand of tobacco and a jackknif
which he alwai carri about with him
that which strike a stranger most peculiarli is their style of
sing thei run on in a low guttur monoton sort of chant
their lip and tongu seem hardli to move and the sound modul
sole in the throat there is veri littl tune to it and the word
so far as i could learn ar extempor thei sing about person and
thing which ar around them and adopt thi method when thei do not
wish to be understood by ani but themselv and it is veri effectu
for with the most care attent i never could detect a word that i
knew i have often heard mr mannini who wa the most note
improvisator among them sing for an hour togeth when at work in
the midst of american and englishmen and by the occasion shout
and laughter of the kanaka who were at a distanc it wa evid
that he wa sing about the differ men that he wa at work with
thei have great power of ridicul and ar excel mimic mani of
them discov and imit the peculiar of our own peopl
befor we had seen them ourselv
these were the peopl with whom i wa to spend a few month and who
with the except of the offic nichola the frenchman and the boi
made the whole popul of the beach i ought perhap to except
the dog for thei were an import part of our settlement some of
the first vessel brought dog out with them who for conveni
were left ashor and there multipli until thei came to be a great
peopl while i wa on the beach the averag number wa about forti
and probabl an equal or greater number ar drown or kill in some
other wai everi year thei ar veri us in guard the beach the
indian be afraid to come down at night for it wa imposs for
ani on to get within half a mile of the hidehous without a gener
alarm the father of the coloni old sachem so call from the ship
in which he wa brought out di while i wa there full of year and
wa honor buri hog and a few chicken were the rest of the
anim tribe and form like the dog a common compani though thei
were all known and mark and usual fed at the hous to which thei
belong
i had been but a few hour on the beach and the pilgrim wa hardli out
of sight when the cry of sail ho wa rais and a small
hermaphrodit brig round the point bore up into the harbor and came
to anchor it wa the mexican brig fazio which we had left at san
pedro and which had come down to land her tallow try it all over and
make new bag and then take it in and leav the coast thei moor
ship erect their trywork on shore put up a small tent in which
thei all live and commenc oper thei made an addit to our
societi and we spent mani even in their tent where amid the
babel of english spanish french indian and kanaka we found some
word that we could understand in common
the morn after my land i began the duti of hidecur in
order to understand these it will be necessari to give the whole
histori of a hide from the time it is taken from a bullock until it is
put on board the vessel to be carri to boston when the hide is
taken from the bullock hole ar cut round it near the edg by which
it is stake out to dry in thi manner it dri without shrink
after thei ar thu dri in the sun thei ar receiv by the vessel
and brought down to the depot at san diego the vessel land them and
leav them in larg pile near the hous
then begin the hidecur duti the first thing is to put them in
soak thi is done by carri them down at low tide and make them
fast in small pile by rope and let the tide come up and cover
them everi dai we put in soak twentyf for each man which with
us made an hundr and fifti there thei lie fortyeight hour when
thei ar taken out and roll up in wheelbarrow and thrown into the
vat these vat contain brine made veri strong be seawat
with great quantiti of salt thrown in thi pickl the hide and
in thi thei lie fortyeight hour the us of the seawat into
which thei ar first put be mere to soften and clean them from
these vat thei ar taken and lie on a platform twentyfour hour
and then ar spread upon the ground and carefulli stretch and stake
out so that thei mai dry smooth after thei were stake and while yet
wet and soft we us to go upon them with our knive and carefulli
cut off all the bad partsth piec of meat and fat which would
corrupt and infect the whole if stow awai in a vessel for mani
month the larg flipper the ear and all other part which would
prevent close stowag thi wa the most difficult part of our duti as
it requir much skill to take everyth necessari off and not to cut
or injur the hide it wa also a long process as six of us had to
clean an hundr and fifti most of which requir a great deal to be
done to them as the spaniard ar veri careless in skin their
cattl then too as we clean them while thei were stake out we
were oblig to kneel down upon them which alwai give beginn the
backach the first dai i wa so slow and awkward that i clean onli
eight at the end of a few dai i doubl my number and in a fortnight
or three week could keep up with the other and clean my
proportiontwentyf
thi clean must be got through with befor noon for by that time
thei get too dry after the sun ha been upon them a few hour thei
ar carefulli gone over with scraper to get off all the greas which
the sun bring out thi be done the stake ar pull up and the
hide carefulli doubl with the hair side out and left to dry
about the middl of the afternoon thei ar turn upon the other side
and at sundown pile up and cover over the next dai thei ar spread
out and open again and at night if fulli dry ar thrown upon a
long horizont pole five at a time and beat with flail thi
take all the dust from them then be salt scrape clean
dri and beaten thei ar stow awai in the hous here end their
histori except that thei ar taken out again when the vessel is readi
to go home beaten stow awai on board carri to boston tan
made into shoe and other articl for which leather is us and mani
of them veri probabl in the end brought back again to california in
the shape of shoe and worn out in pursuit of other bullock or in
the cure of other hide
by put an hundr and fifti in soak everi dai we had the same
number at each stage of cure on each dai so that we had everi dai
the same work to do upon the same number an hundr and fifti to put
in soak an hundr and fifti to wash out and put in the vat the same
number to haul from the vat and put on the platform to drain the same
number to spread and stake out and clean and the same number to beat
and stow awai in the home i ought to except sundai for by a
prescript which no captain or agent ha yet ventur to break in
upon sundai ha been a dai of leisur on the beach for year on
saturdai night the hide in everi stage of progress ar carefulli
cover up and not uncov until mondai morn on sundai we had
absolut no work to do unless it wa to kill a bullock which wa
sent down for our us about onc a week and sometim came on sundai
anoth good arrang wa that we had just so much work to do and
when that wa through the time wa our own know thi we work
hard and need no drive we turn out everi morn at the
first sign of daylight and allow a short time about eight
oclock for breakfast gener got through our labor between on and
two oclock when we dine and had the rest of the time to ourselv
until just befor sundown when we beat the dry hide and put them in
the hous and cover over all the other by thi mean we had about
three hour to ourselv everi afternoon and at sundown we had our
supper and our work wa done for the dai there wa no watch to stand
and no topsail to reef the even we gener spent at on
anoth hous and i often went up and spent an hour or so at the
oven which wa call the kanaka hotel and the oahu coffeehous
immedi after dinner we usual took a short sista to make up for
our earli rise and spent the rest of the afternoon accord to our
own fanci i gener read wrote and made or mend cloth for
necess the mother of invent had taught me these two latter
art the kanaka went up to the oven and spent the time in sleep
talk and smoke and my messmat nichola who neither knew how
to read or write pass awai the time by a long sista two or three
smoke with hi pipe and a paso to the other hous thi leisur
time is never interf with for the captain know that the men earn
it by work hard and fast and that if thei interf with it the
men could easili make their twentyf hide apiec last through the
dai we were pretti independ too for the master of the
housecapitan de la casahad noth to sai to us except when we
were at work on the hide and although we could not go up to the town
without hi permiss thi wa seldom or never refus
the great weight of the wet hide which we were oblig to roll about
in wheelbarrow the continu stoop upon those which were peg
out to be clean and the smell of the vat into which we were often
oblig to get kneedeep to press down the hide all made the work
disagre and fatiguingbut we soon got harden to it and the
compar independ of our life reconcil us to it for there wa
nobodi to haze us and find fault and when we got through we had onli
to wash and chang our cloth and our time wa our own there wa
howev on except to the time be our own which wa that on
two afternoon of everi week we were oblig to go off and get wood
for the cook to us in the gallei wood is veri scarc in the vicin
of san diego there be no tree of ani size for mile in the
town the inhabit burn the small wood which grow in thicket and
for which thei send out indian in larg number everi few dai
fortun the climat is so fine that thei had no need of a fire in
their hous and onli us it for cook with us the get of wood
wa a great troubl for all that in the vicin of the hous had
been cut down and we were oblig to go off a mile or two and to
carri it some distanc on our back as we could not get the handcart
up the hill and over the uneven place two afternoon in the week
gener mondai and thursdai as soon as we had got through dinner we
start off for the bush each of us furnish with a hatchet and a
long piec of rope and drag the handcart behind us and follow
by the whole coloni of dog who were alwai readi for the bush and
were half mad whenev thei saw our prepar we went with the
handcart as far as we could conveni drag it and leav it in an
open conspicu place separ ourselv each take hi own
cours and look about for some good place to begin upon
frequent we had to go nearli a mile from the handcart befor we
could find ani fit place have light upon a good thicket the next
thing wa to clear awai the underbrush and have fair plai at the
tree these tree ar seldom more than five or six feet high and the
highest that i ever saw in these expedit could not have been more
than twelv so that with lop off the branch and clear awai
the underwood we had a good deal of cut to do for a veri littl
wood have cut enough for a backload the next thing wa to make
it well fast with the rope and heav the bundl upon our back and
take the hatchet in hand to walk off up hill and down dale to the
handcart two good backload apiec fill the handcart and that
wa each on proport when each had brought down hi second load
we fill the handcart and took our wai again slowli back and
unload cover the hide for the night and get our supper
finish the dai work
these wood excurs had alwai a mixtur of someth rather
pleasant in them roam about in the wood with hatchet in hand
like a backwoodsman follow by a troop of dog start up of bird
snake hare and fox and examin the variou kind of tree
flower and bird nest wa at least a chang from the monoton
drag and pull on shipboard frequent too we had some amus and
adventur the coati of which i have befor spokena sort of
mixtur of the fox and wolf breedsfierc littl anim with bushi
tail and larg head and a quick sharp bark abound here as in all
other part of california these the dog were veri watch for and
whenev thei saw them start off in full run after them we had
mani fine chase yet although our dog ran fine the rascal
gener escap thei ar a match for the dogon to onebut as
the dog gener went in squad there wa seldom a fair fight a
smaller dog belong to us onc attack a coati singl and got a
good deal worst and might perhap have been kill had we not come
to hi assist we had howev on dog which gave them a good
deal of troubl and mani hard run he wa a fine tall fellow and
unit strength and agil better than ani dog that i have ever seen
he wa born at the island hi father be an english mastiff and
hi mother a greyhound he had the high head long leg narrow bodi
and spring gait of the latter and the heavi jaw thick jowl and
strong forequart of the mastiff when he wa brought to san diego
an english sailor said that he look about the face precis like
the duke of wellington whom he had onc seen at the tower and
inde there wa someth about him which resembl the portrait of
the duke from thi time he wa christen welli and becam the
favorit and bulli of the beach he alwai led the dog by sever
yard in the chase and had kill two coati at differ time in
singl combat we often had fine sport with these fellow a quick
sharp bark from a coati and in an instant everi dog wa at the height
of hi speed a few moment made up for an unfair start and gave each
dog hi rel place welli at the head seem almost to skim over
the bush and after him came fanni feliciana childer and the
other fleet onesth spaniel and terrier and then behind follow
the heavi corpsbulldog etc for we had everi breed pursuit by us
wa in vain and in about half an hour a few of them would come pant
and straggl back
besid the coati the dog sometim made prize of rabbit and hare
which ar veri plenti here and great number of which we often shot
for our dinner there wa anoth anim that i wa not so much
dispos to find amus from and that wa the rattlesnak these
ar veri abund here especi dure the spring of the year the
latter part of the time that i wa on shore i did not meet with so
mani but for the first two month we seldom went into the bush
without on of our number start some of them the first that i ever
saw i rememb perfectli well i had left my companion and wa
begin to clear awai a fine clump of tree when just in the midst
of the thicket not more than eight yard from me on of these fellow
set up hi hiss it is a sharp continu sound and resembl veri
much the let off of the steam from the small pipe of a steamboat
except that it is on a smaller scale i knew by the sound of an ax
that on of my companion wa near and call out to him to let him
know what i had fallen upon he took it veri lightli and as he seem
inclin to laugh at me for be afraid i determin to keep my
place i knew that so long as i could hear the rattl i wa safe for
these snake never make a nois when thei ar in motion accordingli
i kept at my work and the nois which i made with cut and break
the tree kept him in alarm so that i had the rattl to show me hi
whereabout onc or twice the nois stop for a short time which
gave me a littl uneasi and retreat a few step i threw
someth into the bush at which he would set hi rattl ago and
find that he had not move from hi first place i wa easi again
in thi wai i continu at my work until i had cut a full load never
suffer him to be quiet for a moment have cut my load i strap
it togeth and got everyth readi for start i felt that i could
now call the other without the imput of be afraid and went in
search of them in a few minut we were all collect and began an
attack upon the bush the big frenchman who wa the on that i had
call to at first i found as littl inclin to approach the snake as
i had been the dog too seem afraid of the rattl and kept up a
bark at a safe distanc but the kanaka show no fear and get
long stick went into the bush and keep a bright lookout stood
within a few feet of him on or two blow struck near him and a few
stone thrown start him and we lost hi track and had the pleasant
conscious that he might be directli under our feet by throw
stone and chip in differ direct we made him spring hi rattl
again and began anoth attack thi time we drove him into the clear
ground and saw him glide off with head and tail erect when a
stone well aim knock him over the bank down a decliv of
fifteen or twenti feet and stretch him at hi length have made
sure of him by a few more stone we went down and on of the kanaka
cut off hi rattl these rattl vari in number it is said accord
to the ag of the snake though the indian think thei indic the
number of creatur thei have kill we alwai preserv them as
trophi and at the end of the summer had quit a number none of our
peopl were ever bitten by them but on of our dog di of a bite
and anoth wa suppos to have been bitten but recov we had no
remedi for the bite though it wa said that the indian of the countri
had and the kanaka profess to have an herb which would cure it but
it wa fortun never brought to the test
hare and rabbit as i said befor were abund and dure the
winter month the water ar cover with wild duck and gees crow
too were veri numer and frequent alight in great number upon
our hide pick at the piec of dri meat and fat bear and
wolv ar numer in the upper part and in the interior and
inde a man wa kill by a bear within a few mile of san pedro
while we were there but there were none in our immedi
neighborhood the onli other anim were hors over a dozen of
these were own by differ peopl on the beach and were allow to

the poor wretch sit on the bare ground in front of the calabozo
with hi feet chain to a stake and handcuff about hi wrist i
knew there wa veri littl hope for him although the deed wa done in
hot blood the hors on which he wa sit be hi own and a great
favorit yet he wa an indian and that wa enough in about a week
after i saw him i heard that he had been shot these few instanc
will serv to give on a notion of the distribut of justic in
california
in their domest relat these peopl ar no better than in their
public the men ar thriftless proud and extravag and veri much
given to game and the women have but littl educ and a good
deal of beauti and their moral of cours is none of the best yet
the instanc of infidel ar much less frequent than on would at
first suppos in fact on vice is set over against anoth and
thu someth like a balanc is obtain the women have but littl
virtu but then the jealousi of their husband is extrem and their
reveng deadli and almost certain a few inch of cold steel ha been
the punish of mani an unwari man who ha been guilti perhap of
noth more than indiscret of manner the difficulti of the
attempt ar numer and the consequ of discoveri fatal with
the unmarri women too great watch is us the main object
of the parent is to marri their daughter well and to thi the
slightest slip would be fatal the sharp ey of a duea and the cold
steel of a father or brother ar a protect which the charact of
most of themmen and womenrend by no mean useless for the veri
men who would lai down their live to aveng the dishonor of their own
famili would risk the same live to complet the dishonor of anoth
of the poor indian veri littl care is taken the priest inde
at the mission ar said to keep them veri strictli and some rule
ar usual made by the alcald to punish their misconduct but it all
amount to but littl inde to show the entir want of ani sens of
moral or domest duti among them i have frequent known an indian
to bring hi wife to whom he wa lawfulli marri in the church down
to the beach and carri her back again divid with her the monei
which she had got from the sailor if ani of the girl were
discov by the alcald to be open evilliv thei were whip
and kept at work sweep the squar of the presidio and carri mud
and brick for the build yet a few rel would gener bui them
off intemper too is a common vice among the indian the
spaniard on the contrari ar veri abstemi and i do not rememb
ever have seen a spaniard intox
such ar the peopl who inhabit a countri embrac four or five
hundr mile of seacoast with sever good harbor with fine

our absenc two year in all thi would be pretti long but would not
be fatal it would not necessarili be decis of my futur life but

station and the order is givengo below the watch
dure the last twentyfour hour of the passag we beat off and on
the land make a tack about onc in four hour so that i had a
suffici opportun to observ the work of the ship and
certainli it took no more men to brace about thi ship lower yard
which were more than fifti feet squar than it did those of the
pilgrim which were not much more than half the size so much depend
upon the manner in which the brace run and the state of the block
and captain wilson of the ayacucho who wa afterward a passeng
with us upon a trip to windward said he had no doubt that our ship
work two men lighter than hi brig
fridai sept 11th thi morn at four oclock went below san
pedro point be about two leagu ahead and the ship go on under
studdingsail in about an hour we were wake up by the haul of
the chain about deck and in a few minut all hand ahoi wa
call and we were all at work haul in and make up the
studdingsail overhaul the chain forward and get the anchor
readi the pilgrim is there at anchor said some on as we were
run about deck and take a moment look over the rail i saw my
old friend deepli laden ly at anchor insid of the kelp in
come to anchor as well as in tack each on had hi station and
duti the light sail were clew up and furl the cours haul up
and the jib down then came the topsail in the buntlin and the
anchor let go as soon as she wa well at anchor all hand lai aloft
to furl the topsail and thi i soon found wa a great matter on
board thi ship for everi sailor know that a vessel is judg of a
good deal by the furl of her sail the third mate a sailmak and
the larboard watch went upon the fore topsail yard the second mate
carpent and the starboard watch upon the main and myself and the
english lad and the two boston boi and the young capecod man
furl the mizen topsail thi sail belong to us altogeth to reef
and to furl and not a man wa allow to come upon our yard the mate
took us under hi special care frequent make us furl the sail
over three or four time until we got the bunt up to a perfect cone
and the whole sail without a wrinkl as soon as each sail wa haul
up and the bunt made the jigger wa bent on to the slack of the
buntlin and the bunt trice up on deck the mate then took hi
place between the knighthead to twig the fore on the windlass to
twig the main and at the foot of the mainmast for the mizen and if
anyth wa wrongtoo much bunt on on side clew too taut or too
slack or ani sail abaft the yardth whole must be drop again
when all wa right the bunt were trice well up the yardarm gasket
pass so as not to leav a wrinkl forward of the yardshort gasket
with turn close togeth
from the moment of let go the anchor when the captain ceas hi
care of thing the chief mate is the great man with a voic like a
young lion he wa halloo and bawl in all direct make
everyth fly and at the same time do everyth well he wa
quit a contrast to the worthi quiet unobtrus mate of the pilgrim
not so estim a man perhap but a far better mate of a vessel and
the entir chang in captain ts conduct sinc he took command of
the ship wa ow no doubt in a great measur to thi fact if
the chief offic want forc disciplin slacken everyth get out
of joint the captain interfer continu that make a difficulti
between them which encourag the crew and the whole end in a
threesid quarrel but mr brown the mate of the alert want no
help from anybodi took everyth into hi own hand and wa more
like to encroach upon the author of the master than to need ani
spur captain t gave hi direct to the mate in privat
and except in come to anchor get under weigh tack reef
topsail and other allhandswork seldom appear in person thi
is the proper state of thing and while thi last and there is a
good understand aft everyth will go on well
have furl all the sail the royal yard were next to be sent down
the english lad and myself sent down the main which wa larger than
the pilgrim main topgal yard two more light hand the fore
and on boi the mizen thi order we alwai kept while on the coast
send them up and down everi time we came in and went out of port
thei were all trip and lower togeth the main on the starboard
side and the fore and mizen to port no sooner wa she all snug
than tackl were got up on the yard and stai and the longboat and
pinnac hove out the swing boom were then gui out and the boat
made fast by geswarp and everyth in harbor style after
breakfast the hatch were taken off and all got readi to receiv
hide from the pilgrim all dai boat were pass and repass
until we had taken her hide from her and left her in ballast trim
these hide made but littl show in our hold though thei had load
the pilgrim down to the water edg thi chang of the hide
settl the question of the destin of the two vessel which had
been on of some specul to us we were to remain in the leeward
port while the pilgrim wa to sail the next morn for san
francisco after we had knock off work and clear up deck for the
night my friend s came on board and spent an hour with me in our
berth between deck the pilgrim crew envi me my place on board the
ship and seem to think that i had got a littl to windward of them
especi in the matter of go home first s wa determin to
go home on the alert by beg or bui if captain t would not
let him come on other term he would purchas an exchang with some
on of the crew the prospect of anoth year after the alert should
sail wa rather too much of the monkei about seven oclock the
mate came down into the steerag in fine trim for fun rous the boi
out of the berth turn up the carpent with hi fiddl sent the
steward with light to put in the betweendeck and set all hand to
danc the betweendeck were high enough to allow of jump and
be clear and white from holyston made a fine dancinghal
some of the pilgrim crew were in the forecastl and we all turnedto
and had a regular sailor shuffl till eight bell the capecod boi
could danc the true fisherman jig barefoot knock with hi
heel and slap the deck with hi bare feet in time with the
music thi wa a favorit amus of the mate who alwai stood
at the steerag door look on and if the boi would not danc he
haze them round with a rope end much to the amus of the men
the next morn accord to the order of the agent the pilgrim set
sail for the windward to be gone three or four month she got under
weigh with veri littl fuss and came so near us as to throw a letter
on board captain faucon stand at the tiller himself and steer
her as he would a mackerel smack when captain t wa in command of
the pilgrim there wa as much prepar and ceremoni as there would
be in get a seventyfour under weigh captain faucon wa a sailor
everi inch of him he knew what a ship wa and wa as much at home in
on as a cobbler in hi stall i want no better proof of thi than
the opinion of the ship crew for thei had been six month under hi
command and knew what he wa and if sailor allow their captain to be
a good seaman you mai be sure he is on for that is a thing thei ar
not alwai readi to sai
after the pilgrim left us we lai three week at san pedro from the
11th of septemb until the 2nd of octob engag in the usual port
duti of land cargo take off hide etc etc these duti
were much easier and went on much more agreeabl than on board the
pilgrim the more the merrier is the sailor maxim and a boat
crew of a dozen could take off all the hide brought down in a dai
without much troubl by divis of labor and on shore as well as on
board a good will and no discont or grumbl make everyth go
well the offic too who usual went with us the third mate wa
a fine young fellow and made no unnecessari troubl so that we
gener had quit a sociabl time and were glad to be reliev from
the restraint of the ship while here i often thought of the
miser gloomi week we had spent in thi dull place in the brig
discont and hard usag on board and four hand to do all the work
on shore give me a big ship there is more room more hand better
outfit better regul more life and more compani anoth thing
wa better arrang here we had a regular gig crew a light
whaleboat handsom paint and fit out with stern seat yoke
tillerrop etc hung on the starboard quarter and wa us as the
gig the youngest lad in the ship a boston boi about thirteen year
old wa coxswain of thi boat and had the entir charg of her to
keep her clean and have her in readi to go and come at ani hour
four light hand of about the same size and ag of whom i wa on
form the crew each had hi oar and seat number and we were
oblig to be in our place have our oar scrape white our tholepin
in and the fender over the side the bowman had charg of the
boathook and painter and the coxswain of the rudder yoke and
sternsheet our duti wa to carri the captain and agent about and
passeng off and on which last wa no trifl duti as the peopl
on shore have no boat and everi purchas from the boi who bui hi
pair of shoe to the trader who bui hi cask and bale were to be
taken off and on in our boat some dai when peopl were come and
go fast we were in the boat pull off and on all dai long with
hardli time for our meal make as we lai nearli three mile from
shore from forti to fifti mile row in a dai still we thought it
the best berth in the ship for when the gig wa emploi we had
noth to do with the cargo except small bundl which the passeng
carri with them and no hide to carri besid the opportun of
see everybodi make acquaint hear the new etc unless
the captain or agent were in the boat we had no offic with us and
often had fine time with the passeng who were alwai will to
talk and joke with us frequent too we were oblig to wait
sever hour on shore when we would haul the boat up on the beach
and leav on to watch her go up to the nearest hous or spend the
time in stroll about the beach pick up shell or plai
hopscotch and other game on the hard sand the rest of the crew
never left the ship except for bring heavi good and take off
hide and though we were alwai in the water the surf hardli leav
us a dry thread from morn till night yet we were young and the
climat wa good and we thought it much better than the quiet
humdrum drag and pull on board ship we made the acquaint of
nearli half of california for besid carri everybodi in our
boatmen women and childrenal the messag letter and light
packag went by us and be known by our dress we found a readi
recept everywher
at san pedro we had none of thi amus for there be but on
hous in the place we of cours had but littl compani all the
varieti that i had wa ride onc a week to the nearest rancho to
order a bullock down for the ship
the brig catalina came in from san diego and be bound up to
windward we both got under weigh at the same time for a trial of
speed up to santa barbara a distanc of about eighti mile we hove up
and got under sail about eleven oclock at night with a light
landbreez which di awai toward morn leav us becalm onli a
few mile from our anchoringplac the catalina be a small
vessel of less than half our size put out sweep and got a boat
ahead and pull out to sea dure the night so that she had the
seabreez earlier and stronger than we did and we had the
mortif of see her stand up the coast with a fine breez
the sea all ruffl about her while we were becalm inshor when
the seabreez di awai she wa nearli out of sight and toward the
latter part of the afternoon the regular northwest wind set in fresh
we brace sharp upon it took a pull at everi sheet tack and halyard
and stood after her in fine style our ship be veri good upon a
tauten bowlin we had nearli five hour of fine sail beat
up to windward by long stretch in and off shore and evid
gain upon the catalina at everi tack when thi breez left us we
were so near as to count the paint port on her side fortun
the wind di awai when we were on our inward tack and she on her
outward so we were inshor and caught the landbreez first which
came off upon our quarter about the middl of the first watch all
hand were turnedup and we set all sail to the skysail and the
royal studdingsail and with these we glide quietli through the
water leav the catalina which could not spread so much canva as
we gradual astern and by daylight were off st buenaventura and
our antagonist nearli out of sight the seabreez howev favor
her again while we were becalm under the headland and labor
slowli along she wa abreast of us by noon thu we continu ahead
astern and abreast of on anoth altern now far out at sea
and again close in under the shore on the third morn we came
into the great bai of santa barbara two hour behind the brig and
thu lost the bet though if the race had been to the point we should
have beaten her by five or six hour thi howev settl the
rel sail of the vessel for it wa admit that although she
be small and light could gain upon us in veri light wind yet
whenev there wa breez enough to set us ago we walk awai from
her like haul in a line and in beat to windward which is the
best trial of a vessel we had much the advantag of her
sundai oct 4th thi wa the dai of our arriv and somehow or
other our captain alwai manag not onli to sail but to come into
port on a sundai the main reason for sail on the sabbath is not
as mani peopl suppos becaus sundai is thought a lucki dai but
becaus it is a leisur dai dure the six dai the crew ar
emploi upon the cargo and other ship work and the sabbath be
their onli dai of rest whatev addit work can be thrown into
sundai is so much gain to the owner thi is the reason of our
coaster packet etc sail on the sabbath thei get six good
dai work out of the crew and then throw all the labor of sail
into the sabbath thu it wa with us nearli all the time we were on
the coast and mani of our sabbath were lost entir to us the
cathol on shore have no trade and make no journei on sundai but
the american ha no nation religion and like to show hi
independ of priestcraft by do as he choos on the lord dai
santa barbara look veri much as it did when i left it five month
befor the long sand beach with the heavi roller break upon it
in a continu roar and the littl town imbed on the plain girt
by it amphitheatr of mountain dai after dai the sun shone clear
and bright upon the wide bai and the red roof of the hous
everyth be as still as death the peopl realli hardli seem to
earn their sunlight daylight actual seem thrown awai upon them
we had a few visitor and collect about a hundr hide and everi
night at sundown the gig wa sent ashor to wait for the captain
who spent hi even in the town we alwai took our monkeyjacket
with us and flint and steel and made a fire on the beach with the
driftwood and the bush we pull from the neighbor thicket and
lai down by it on the sand sometim we would strai up to the town
if the captain wa like to stai late and pass the time at some of
the hous in which we were almost alwai well receiv by the
inhabit sometim earlier and sometim later the captain came
down when after a good drench in the surf we went aboard chang
our cloth and turn in for the nightyet not for all the night
for there wa the anchor watch to stand
thi lead me to speak of my watchmat for nine monthsand take him
all in all the most remark man i have ever seentom harri an
hour everi night while ly in port harri and myself had the deck
to ourselv and walk fore and aft night after night for month
i learn hi whole charact and histori and more about foreign
nation the habit of differ peopl and especi the secret of
sailor live and hardship and also of practic seamanship in
which he wa abundantli capabl of instruct me than i could ever
have learn elsewher but the most remark thing about him wa
the power of hi mind hi memori wa perfect seem to form a
regular chain reach from hi earliest childhood up to the time i
knew him without on link want hi power of calcul too wa
remark i call myself pretti quick at figur and had been
through a cours of mathemat studi but work by my head i
wa unabl to keep within sight of thi man who had never been beyond
hi arithmet so rapid wa hi calcul he carri in hi head
not onli a logbook of the whole voyag in which everyth wa
complet and accur and from which no on ever thought of appeal
but also an accur registri of all the cargo know precis
where each thing wa and how mani hide we took in at everi port
on night he made a rough calcul of the number of hide that
could be stow in the lower hold between the fore and main mast
take the depth of hold and breadth of beam for he alwai knew the
dimens of everi part of the ship befor he had been a month on
board and the averag area and thick of a hide he came
surprisingli near the number as it afterward turn out the mate
frequent came to him to know the capac of differ part of the
vessel so he could tell the sailmak veri nearli the amount of canva
he would want for each sail in the ship for he knew the hoist of everi
mast and spread of everi sail on the head and foot in feet and
inch when we were at sea he kept a run account in hi head
of the ship wayth number of knot and the cours and if the
cours did not vari much dure the twentyfour hour by take the
whole progress and allow so mani eighth south or north to
so mani east or west he would make up hi reckon just befor
the captain took the sun at noon and often came wonderfulli near the
mark calcul of all kind wa hi delight he had in hi chest
sever volum give account of invent in mechan which he
read with great pleasur and made himself master of i doubt if he
ever forgot anyth that he read the onli thing in the wai of poetri
that he ever read wa falcon shipwreck which he wa delight
with and whole page of which he could repeat he knew the name of
everi sailor that had ever been hi shipmat and also of everi
vessel captain and offic and the princip date of each voyag
and a sailor whom he afterward fell in with who had been in a ship
with harri nearli twelv year befor wa veri much surpris at
have harri tell him thing about himself which he had entir
forgotten hi fact whether date or event no on thought of
disput and hi opinion few of the sailor dare to oppos for
right or wrong he alwai had the best of the argument with them hi
reason power were remark i have had harder work maintain
an argument with him in a watch even when i knew myself to be right
and he wa onli doubt than i ever had befor not from hi
obstinaci but from hi acut give him onli a littl knowledg of
hi subject and certainli among all the young men of my acquaint
and stand at colleg there wa not on whom i had not rather meet
than thi man i never answer a question from him or advanc an
opinion to him without think more than onc with an iron memori
he seem to have your whole past convers at command and if you
said a thing now which ill agre with someth said month befor he
wa sure to have you on the hip in fact i alwai felt when with
him that i wa with no common man i had a posit respect for hi
power of mind and felt often that if half the pain had been spent
upon hi educ which ar thrown awai yearli in our colleg he
would have been a man of great weight in societi like most
selftaught men he overestim the valu of an educ and thi
i often told him though i profit by it myself for he alwai treat
me with respect and often unnecessarili gave wai to me from an
overestim of my knowledg for the intellectu capac of all
the rest of the crew captain and all he had the most sovereign
contempt he wa a far better sailor and probabl a better navig
than the captain and had more brain than all the after part of the
ship put togeth the sailor said tom got a head as long as the
bowsprit and if ani on got into an argument with him thei would
call outah jack youd better drop that as you would a hot potato
for tom will turn you insid out befor you know it
i recollect hi pose me onc on the subject of the corn law i wa
call to stand my watch and come on deck found him there befor
me and we began as usual to walk fore and aft in the waist he
talk about the corn law ask me my opinion about them which i
gave him and my reason my small stock of which i set forth to the
best advantag suppos hi knowledg on the subject must be less
than mine if inde he had ani at all when i had got through he
took the liberti of differ from me and to my surpris brought
argument and fact connect with the subject which were new to me to
which i wa entir unabl to repli i confess that i knew almost
noth of the subject and express my surpris at the extent of hi
inform he said that a number of year befor while at a
boardinghous in liverpool he had fallen in with a pamphlet on the
subject and as it contain calcul had read it veri carefulli
and had ever sinc wish to find some on who could add to hi stock
of knowledg on the question although it wa mani year sinc he had
seen the book and it wa a subject with which he had no previou
acquaint yet he had the chain of reason found upon
principl of polit economi perfect in hi memori and hi fact
so far as i could judg were correct at least he state them with
great precis the principl of the steam engin too he wa veri
familiar with have been sever month on board of a steamboat and
made himself master of it secret he knew everi lunar star in both
hemispher and wa a perfect master of hi quadrant and sextant
such wa the man who at forti wa still a dog befor the mast at
twelv dollar a month the reason of thi wa to be found in hi
whole past life as i had it at differ time from himself
he wa an englishman by birth a nativ of ilfracomb in devonshir
hi father wa skipper of a small coaster from bristol and dy
left him when quit young to the care of hi mother by whose
exert he receiv a commonschool educ pass hi winter at
school and hi summer in the coast trade until hi seventeenth
year when he left home to go upon foreign voyag of hi mother he
often spoke with the greatest respect and said that she wa a
strongmind woman and had the best system of educ he had ever
known a system which had made respect men of hi three brother
and fail onli in him from hi own indomit obstinaci on thing
he often mention in which he said hi mother differ from all other
mother that he had ever seen disciplin their children that wa
that when he wa out of humor and refus to eat instead of put
hi plate awai as most mother would and sai that hi hunger would
bring him to it in time she would stand over him and oblig him to
eat iteveri mouth of it it wa no fault of her that he wa what
i saw him and so great wa hi sens of gratitud for her effort
though unsuccess that he determin at the close of the voyag to
embark for home with all the wage he should get to spend with and for
hi mother if perchanc he should find her aliv
after leav home he had spent nearli twenti year sail upon all
sort of voyag gener out of the port of new york and boston
twenti year of vice everi sin that a sailor know he had gone to
the bottom of sever time he had been haul up in the hospit
and as often the great strength of hi constitut had brought him
out again in health sever time too from hi known capac he
had been promot to the offic of chief mate and as often hi
conduct when in port especi hi drunken which neither fear
nor ambit could induc him to abandon put him back into the
forecastl on night when give me an account of hi life and
lament the year of manhood he had thrown awai he said that there
in the forecastl at the foot of the stepsa chest of old
clotheswa the result of twentytwo year of hard labor and
exposurework like a hors and treat like a dog as he grew
older he began to feel the necess of some provis for hi later
year and came gradual to the convict that rum had been hi worst
enemi on night in havana a young shipmat of hi wa brought
aboard drunk with a danger gash in hi head and hi monei and new
cloth strip from him harri had seen and been in hundr of
such scene as these but in hi then state of mind it fix hi
determin and he resolv never to tast anoth drop of strong
drink of ani kind he sign no pledg and made no vow but reli
on hi own strength of purpos the first thing with him wa a reason
and then a resolut and the thing wa done the date of hi
resolut he knew of cours to the veri hour it wa three year
befor i knew him and dure all that time noth stronger than
cider or coffe had pass hi lip the sailor never thought of
entic tom to take a glass ani more than thei would of talk to
the ship compass he wa now a temper man for life and capabl
of fill ani berth in a ship and mani a high station there is on
shore which is held by a meaner man
he understood the manag of a ship upon scientif principl and
could give the reason for haul everi rope and a long experi
ad to care observ at the time and a perfect memori gave
him a knowledg of the expedi and resort in time of hazard which
wa remark and for which i becam much indebt to him as he took
the greatest pleasur in open hi store of inform to me in
return for what i wa abl to do for him stori of tyranni and
hardship which had driven men to piracyof the incred ignor
of master and mate and of horrid brutal to the sick dead and
dy as well as of the secret knaveri and imposit practis upon
seamen by conniv of the owner landlord and offic all these
he had and i could not but believ them for men who had known him for
fifteen year had never taken him even in an exagger and as i
have said hi statement were never disput i rememb among other
thing hi speak of a captain whom i had known by report who never
hand a thing to a sailor but put it on deck and kick it to him
and of anoth who wa of the best connect in boston who
absolut murder a lad from boston that went out with him befor the
mast to sumatra by keep him hard at work while ill of the coast

san diego againa descenthurri departurea new shipmat
sundai oct 11th set sail thi morn for the leeward pass
within sight of san pedro and to our great joi did not come to
anchor but kept directli on to san diego where we arriv and moor
ship on
thursdai oct 15th found here the italian ship la rosa from the
windward which report the brig pilgrim at san francisco all well
everyth wa as quiet here as usual we discharg our hide horn
and tallow and were readi to sail again on the follow sundai i
went ashor to my old quarter and found the gang at the hidehous
go on in the even tenor of their wai and spent an hour or two
after dark at the oven take a whiff with my old kanaka friend who
realli seem glad to see me again and salut me as the aikan of the
kanaka i wa griev to find that my poor dog bravo wa dead he
had sicken and di suddenli the veri dai after i sail in the
alert
sundai wa again as usual our sail dai and we got under weigh
with a stiff breez which remind us that it wa the latter part of
the autumn and time to expect southeast onc more we beat up
against a strong head wind under reef topsail as far as san juan
where we came to anchor nearli three mile from the shore with
sliprop on our cabl in the old southeast style of last winter
on the passag up we had an old sea captain on board who had marri
and settl in california and had not been on salt water for more than
fifteen year he wa astonish at the chang and improv that
had been made in ship and still more at the manner in which we
carri sail for he wa realli a littl frighten and said that
while we had topgal sail on he should have been under reef
topsail the work of the ship and her progress to windward seem
to delight him for he said she went to windward as though she were
kedg
tuesdai oct 20th have got everyth readi we set the agent
ashor who went up to the mission to hasten down the hide for the
next morn thi night we had the strictest order to look out for
southeast and the long low cloud seem rather threaten but
the night pass over without ani troubl and earli the next morn
we hove out the longboat and pinnac lower awai the quarterboat
and went ashor to bring off our hide here we were again in thi
romant spot a perpendicular hill twice the height of the ship
masthead with a singl circuit path to the top and long sand
beach at it base with the swell of the whole pacif break high
upon it and our hide rang in pile on the overhang summit the
captain sent me who wa the onli on of the crew that had ever been
there befor to the top to count the hide and pitch them down
there i stood again as six month befor throw off the hide and
watch them pitch and scale to the bottom while the men
dwarf by the distanc were walk to and fro on the beach carri
the hide as thei pick them up to the distant boat upon the top
of their head two or three boatload were sent off until at last
all were thrown down and the boat nearli load again when we were
delai by a dozen or twenti hide which had lodg in the recess of
the hill and which we could not reach by ani missil as the gener
line of the side wa exactli perpendicular and these place were cave
in and could not be seen or reach from the top as hide ar worth
in boston twelv and a half cent a pound and the captain commiss
wa two per cent he determin not to give them up and sent on board
for a pair of topgal studdingsail halyard and request some
on of the crew to go to the top and come down by the halyard the
older sailor said the boi who were light and activ ought to go
while the boi thought that strength and experi were necessari
see the dilemma and feel myself to be near the medium of these
requisit i offer my servic and went up with on man to tend
the rope and prepar for the descent
we found a stake fasten strongli into the ground and appar
capabl of hold my weight to which we made on end of the halyard
well fast and take the coil threw it over the brink the end we
saw just reach to a landingplac from which the descent to the
beach wa easi have noth on but shirt trowser and hat the
common searig of warm weather i had no strip to do and began my
descent by take hold of the rope in each hand and slip down
sometim with hand and feet round the rope and sometim breast
off with on hand and foot against the precipic and hold on to the
rope with the other in thi wai i descend until i came to a place
which shelv in and in which the hide were lodg keep hold of
the rope with on hand i scrambl in and by the other hand and feet
succeed in dislodg all the hide and continu on my wai just
below thi place the precipic project again and go over the
project i could see noth below me but the sea and the rock upon
which it broke and a few gull fly in midair i got down in
safeti pretti well cover with dirt and for my pain wa told what
a dd fool you were to risk your life for a half a dozen hide
while we were carri the hide to the boat i perceiv what i had
been too busi to observ befor that heavi black cloud were roll
up from seaward a strong swell heav in and everi sign of a
southeast the captain hurri everyth the hide were pitch
into the boat and with some difficulti and by wade nearli up to
our armpit we got the boat through the surf and began pull
aboard our gig crew tow the pinnac astern of the gig and the
launch wa tow by six men in the jollyboat the ship wa ly
three mile off pitch at her anchor and the farther we pull the
heavier grew the swell our boat stood nearli up and down sever
time the pinnac part her towlin and we expect everi moment to
see the launch swamp we at length got alongsid our boat half
full of water and now came the greatest difficulti of allunload
the boat in a heavi sea which pitch them about so that it wa
almost imposs to stand in them rais them sometim even with
the rail and again drop them below the bend with great
difficulti we got all the hide aboard and stow under hatch the
yard and stai tackl hook on and the launch and pinnac hoist
check and gripe the quarterboat were then hoist up and we
began heav in on the chain get the anchor wa no easi work in
such a sea but as we were not come back to thi port the captain
determin not to slip the ship head pitch into the sea and the
water rush through the hawsehol and the chain surg so as almost
to unship the barrel of the windlass hove short sir said the
mate ay ay weatherbit your chain and loos the topsail make
sail on her menwith a will a few moment serv to loos the
topsail which were furl with reef to sheet them home and hoist
them up bear a hand wa the order of the dai and everi on saw
the necess of it for the gale wa alreadi upon us the ship broke
out her own anchor which we cat and fish after a fashion and
stood off from the leeshor against a heavi head sea under reef
topsail foretopmast staysail and spanker the fore cours wa given
to her which help her a littl but as she hardli held her own
against the sea which wa settl her leewardboard the main tack
shout the captain when the tack wa carri forward and taken to the
windlass and all hand call to the handspik the great sail
belli out horizont as though it would lift up the main stai the
block rattl and flew about but the forc of machineri wa too much
for her heav ho heav and pawl yo heav hearti ho and in
time with the song by the forc of twenti strong arm the windlass
came slowli round pawl after pawl and the weather clew of the sail
wa brought down to the waterwai the starboard watch haul aft the
sheet and the ship tore through the water like a mad hors quiver
and shake at everi joint and dash from it head the foam which
flew off at everi blow yard and yard to leeward a half hour of
such sail serv our turn when the clew of the sail were haul
up the sail furl and the ship eas of her press went more
quietli on her wai soon after the foresail wa reef and we
mizentop men were sent up to take anoth reef in the mizen topsail
thi wa the first time i had taken a weather ear and i felt not a
littl proud to sit astrid of the weather yardarm pass the ear
and sing out haul out to leeward from thi time until we got to
boston the mate never suffer ani on but our own gang to go upon the
mizen topsail yard either for reef or furl and the young
english lad and myself gener took the ear between us
have clear the point and got well out to sea we squar awai the
yard made more sail and stood on nearli befor the wind for san
pedro it blew strong with some rain nearli all night but fell calm
toward morn and the gale have gone over we cameto
thursdai oct 22d at san pedro in the old southeast berth a
leagu from shore with a sliprop on the cabl reef in the
topsail and ropeyarn for gasket here we lai ten dai with the
usual boat hidecarri roll of cargo up the steep hill
walk barefoot over stone and get drench in salt water
the third dai after our arriv the rosa came in from san juan where
she went the dai after the southeast her crew said it wa as
smooth as a millpond after the gale and she took off nearli a
thousand hide which had been brought down for us and which we lost
in consequ of the southeast thi mortifi us not onli that
an italian ship should have got to windward of us in the trade but
becaus everi thousand hide went toward complet the forti thousand
which we were to collect befor we could sai goodbi to california
while ly here we ship on new hand an englishman of about two
or three and twenti who wa quit an acquisit as he prove to be a
good sailor could sing toler and what wa of more import to
me had a good educ and a somewhat remark histori he call
himself georg p marsh profess to have been at sea from a small
boi and to have serv hi time in the smuggl trade between germani
and the coast of franc and england thu he account for hi
knowledg of the french languag which he spoke and read as well as he
did english but hi cutter educ would not account for hi
english which wa far too good to have been learn in a smuggler for
he wrote an uncommonli handsom hand spoke with great correct and
frequent when in privat talk with me quot from book and show
a knowledg of the custom of societi and particularli of the
formal of the variou english court of law and of parliament
which surpris me still he would give no other account of himself
than that he wa educ in a smuggler a man whom we afterward fell
in with who had been a shipmat of georg a few year befor said
that he heard at the boardinghous from which thei ship that
georg had been at colleg probabl a naval on as he knew no latin
or greek where he learn french and mathemat he wa by no mean
the man by natur that harri wa harri had made everyth of hi
mind and charact in spite of obstacl while thi man had evid
been born in a differ rank and educ earli in life accordingli
but had been a vagabond and done noth for himself sinc what had
been given to him by other wa all that made him to differ from those
about him while harri had made himself what he wa neither had
georg the charact strength of mind acut or memori of harri
yet there wa about him the remain of a pretti good educ which
enabl him to talk perhap beyond hi brain and a high spirit and
sens of honor which year of a dog life had not broken after he
had been a littl while on board we learn from him hi remark
histori for the last two year which we afterward heard confirm in
such a manner as put the truth of it beyond a doubt
he sail from new york in the year 1833 if i mistak not befor the
mast in the brig lascar for canton she wa sold in the east indi
and he ship at manilla in a small schooner bound on a trade
voyag among the ladron and pelew island on on of the latter
island their schooner wa wreck on a reef and thei were attack
by the nativ and after a desper resist in which all their
number except the captain georg and a boi were kill or drown
thei surrend and were carri bound in a cano to a neighbor
island in about a month after thi an opportun occur by which
on of their number might get awai i have forgotten the
circumst but onli on could go and thei yield to the captain
upon hi promis to send them aid if he escap he wa success
in hi attempt got on board an american vessel went back to manilla
and thenc to america without make ani effort for their rescu or
inde as georg afterward discov without even mention their
case to ani on in manilla the boi that wa with georg di and he
be alon and there be no chanc for hi escap the nativ soon
treat him with kind and even with attent thei paint him
tattoo hi bodi for he would never consent to be mark in the face
or hand gave him two or three wive and in fact made quit a pet
of him in thi wai he live for thirteen month in a fine climat
with a plenti to eat half nake and noth to do he soon howev
becam tire and went round the island on differ pretenc to
look out for a sail on dai he wa out fish in a small cano with
anoth man when he saw a larg sail to the windward about a leagu
and a half off pass abreast of the island and stand westward
with some difficulti he persuad the island to go off with him to
the ship promis to return with a good suppli of rum and tobacco
these articl which the island had got a tast of from american
trader were too strong a temptat for the fellow and he consent
thei paddl off in the track of the ship and layto until she came
down to them georg step on board the ship nearli nake paint
from head to foot and in no wai distinguish from hi companion
until he began to speak upon thi the peopl on board were not a
littl astonish and have learn hi stori the captain had him
wash and cloth and send awai the poor astonish nativ with a
knife or two and some tobacco and calico took georg with him on the
voyag thi wa the ship cabot of new york captain low she wa
bound to manilla from across the pacif and georg did seaman duti
in her until her arriv in manilla when he left her and ship in a
brig bound to the sandwich island from oahu he came in the british
brig clementin to monterei as second offic where have some
difficulti with the captain he left her and come down the coast
join us at san pedro nearli six month after thi among some

rumor of wara spouterslip for a southeastera gale
sundai novemb 1st sail thi dai sundai again for santa
barbara where we arriv on the 5th come round st buenaventura
and near the anchorag we saw two vessel in port a larg
fullrig and a small hermaphrodit brig the former the crew said
must be the pilgrim but i had been too long in the pilgrim to be
mistaken in her and i wa right in differ from them for upon
nearer approach her long low shear sharp bow and rake mast
told quit anoth stori manofwar brig said some of them
baltimor clipper said other the ayacucho thought i and soon the
broad fold of the beauti banner of st georgewhit field with
bloodr border and crosswer displai from her peak a few
minut put it beyond a doubt and we were ly by the side of the
ayacucho which had sail from san diego about nine month befor
while we were ly there in the pilgrim she had sinc been to
valparaiso callao and the sandwich island and had just come upon
the coast her boat came on board bring captain wilson and in
half an hour the new wa all over the ship that there wa a war
between the unit state and franc exagger account reach the
forecastl battl had been fought a larg french fleet wa in the
pacif etc etc and on of the boat crew of the ayacucho said
that when thei left callao a larg french frigat and the american
frigat brandywin which were ly there were go outsid to have
a battl and that the english frigat blond wa to be umpir and see
fair plai here wa import new for us alon on an unprotect
coast without an american manofwar within some thousand of mile
and the prospect of a voyag home through the whole length of the
pacif and atlant ocean a french prison seem a much more
probabl place of destin than the good port of boston howev
we were too salt to believ everi yarn that come into the forecastl
and wait to hear the truth of the matter from higher author by
mean of a supercargo clerk i got the account of the matter which
wa that the govern had had difficulti about the payment of a
debt that war had been threaten and prepar for but not actual
declar although it wa pretti gener anticip thi wa not
quit so bad yet wa no small caus of anxieti but we care veri
littl about the matter ourselv happi go lucki with jack we did
not believ that a french prison would be much wors than
hidedrogh on the coast of california and no on who ha not been
on a long dull voyag shut up in on ship can conceiv of the effect
of monotoni upon on thought and wish the prospect of a chang
is like a green spot in a desert and the remotest probabl of great
event and excit scene give a feel of delight and set life in
motion so as to give a pleasur which ani on not in the same state
would be entir unabl to account for in fact a more jovial night
we had not pass in the forecastl for month everi on seem in
unaccount high spirit an undefin anticip of radic
chang of new scene and great do seem to have possess
everi on and the common drudgeri of the vessel appear contempt
here wa a new vein open a grand theme of convers and a topic
for all sort of discuss nation feel wa wrought up joke
were crack upon the onli frenchman in the ship and comparison made
between old hors and soup meagr etc etc
we remain in uncertainti as to thi war for more than two month
when an arriv from the sandwich island brought us the new of an
amic arrang of the difficulti
the other vessel which we found in port wa the hermaphrodit brig
avon from the sandwich island she wa fit up in handsom style
fire a gun and ran her ensign up and down at sunris and sunset had a
band of four or five piec of music on board and appear rather like
a pleasur yacht than a trader yet in connect with the loriott
clementin bolivar convoi and other small vessel belong to
sundri american at oahu she carri on a great tradeleg and
illegalin otter skin silk tea speci etc
the second dai after our arriv a fullrig brig came round the
point from the northward sail leisur through the bai and stood
off again for the southeast in the direct of the larg island of
catalina the next dai the avon got under weigh and stood in the same
direct bound for san pedro thi might do for marin and
californian but we knew the rope too well the brig wa never again
seen on the coast and the avon arriv at san pedro in about a week
with a full cargo of canton and american good
thi wa on of the mean of escap the heavi duti the mexican lai
upon all import a vessel come on the coast enter a moder cargo
at monterei which is the onli customhous and commenc trade in
a month or more have sold a larg part of her cargo she stretch
over to catalina or other of the larg uninhabit island which lie
off the coast in a trip from port to port and suppli herself with
choic good from a vessel from oahu which ha been ly off and on
the island wait for her two dai after the sail of the avon
the loriott came in from the leeward and without doubt had also a
snatch at the brig cargo
tuesdai nov 10th go ashor as usual in the gig just befor
sundown to bring off the captain we found upon take in the captain
and pull off again that our ship which lai the farthest out had
run up her ensign thi meant sail ho of cours but as we were
within the point we could see noth give wai boi give wai lai
out on your oar and long stroke said the captain and stretch to
the whole length of our arm bend back again so that our back
touch the thwart we sent her through the water like a rocket a
few minut of such pull open the island on after anoth in
rang of the point and gave us a view of the canal where wa a ship
under topgal sail stand in with a light breez for the
anchorag put the boat head in the direct of the ship the
captain told us to lai out again and we need no spur for the
prospect of board a new ship perhap from home hear the new
and have someth to tell of when we got back wa excit enough
for us and we gave wai with a will captain nye of the loriott who
had been an old whaleman wa in the sternsheet and fell mightili
into the spirit of it bend your back and break your oar said he
lai me on captain bunker there she fluke and other
exclam peculiar to whalemen in the meantim it fell flat
calm and be within a coupl of mile of the ship we expect to
board her in a few moment when a sudden breez sprung up dead ahead
for the ship and she brace up and stood off toward the island sharp
on the larboard tack make good wai through the water thi of
cours brought us up and we had onli to eas larboard oar pull
round starboard and go aboard the alert with someth veri like a
flea in the ear there wa a light landbreez all night and the ship
did not come to anchor until the next morn as soon as her anchor
wa down we went aboard and found her to be the whaleship wilmington
and liverpool packet of new bedford last from the offshor ground
with nineteen hundr barrel of oil a spouter we knew her to be as
soon as we saw her by her crane and boat and by her stump
topgal mast and a certain slovenli look to the sail rig
spar and hull and when we got on board we found everyth to
correspondspout fashion she had a fals deck which wa rough
and oili and cut up in everi direct by the chime of oil cask her
rig wa slack and turn white no paint on the spar or block
clumsi seiz and strap without cover and homewardbound splice
in everi direct her crew too were not in much better order her
captain wa a slabsid shambleleg quaker in a suit of brown
with a broadbrim hat and sneak about deck like a sheep with
hi head down and the men look more like fishermen and farmer than
thei did like sailor
though it wa by no mean cold weather we have on onli our red
shirt and duck trowser thei all had on woollen trowsersnot blue
and shipshapebut of all colorsbrown drab grei ay and green
with suspend over their shoulder and pocket to put their hand
in thi ad to guernsei frock stripe comfort about the neck
thick cowhid boot woollen cap and a strong oili smell and a
decidedli green look will complet the descript eight or ten were
on the foretopsail yard and as mani more in the main furl the
topsail while eight or ten were hang about the forecastl do
noth thi wa a strang sight for a vessel come to anchor so we
went up to them to see what wa the matter on of them a stout
heartylook fellow held out hi leg and said he had the scurvi
anoth had cut hi hand and other had got nearli well but said that
there were plenti aloft to furl the sail so thei were soger on the
forecastl there wa onli on splicer on board a finelook old
tar who wa in the bunt of the foretopsail he wa probabl the onli
sailor in the ship befor the mast the mate of cours and the
boatsteer and also two or three of the crew had been to sea
befor but onli whale voyag and the greater part of the crew were
raw hand just from the bush as green as cabbag and had not yet
got the hayse out of their head the mizen topsail hung in the
buntlin until everyth wa furl forward thu a crew of thirti
men were half an hour in do what would have been done in the alert
with eighteen hand to go aloft in fifteen or twenti minut
we found thei had been at sea six or eight month and had no new to
tell us so we left them and promis to get liberti to come on board
in the even for some curios etc accordingli as soon as we
were knock off in the even and had got supper we obtain leav
took a boat and went aboard and spent an hour or two thei gave us
piec of whalebon and the teeth and other part of curiou sea
anim and we exchang book with thema practic veri common among
ship in foreign port by which you get rid of the book you have read
and reread and a suppli of new on in their stead and jack is not
veri nice as to their compar valu
thursdai nov 12th thi dai wa quit cool in the earli part and
there were black cloud about but as it wa often so in the morn
noth wa apprehend and all the captain went ashor togeth to
spend the dai toward noon the cloud hung heavili over the
mountain come half wai down the hill that encircl the town of
santa barbara and a heavi swell roll in from the southeast the
mate immedi order the gig crew awai and at the same time we
saw boat pull ashor from the other vessel here wa a grand
chanc for a row match and everi on did hi best we pass the
boat of the ayacucho and loriott but could gain noth upon and
inde hardli hold our own with the long sixoar boat of the
whaleship thei reach the breaker befor us but here we had the
advantag of them for not be us to the surf thei were oblig
to wait to see us beach our boat just as in the same place nearli a
year befor we in the pilgrim were glad to be taught by a boat
crew of kanaka
we had hardli got the boat beach and their head out befor our
old friend bill jackson the handsom english sailor who steer the
loriott boat call out that the brig wa adrift and sure enough
she wa drag her anchor and drift down into the bight of the
bai without wait for the captain for there wa no on on board
but the mate and steward he sprung into the boat call the kanaka
togeth and tri to put off but the kanaka though capit
waterdog were frighten by their vessel be adrift and by the
emerg of the case and seem to lose their faculti twice
their boat fill and came broadsid upon the beach jackson swore at
them for a parcel of savag and promis to flog everi on of them
thi made the matter no better when we came forward told the kanaka
to take their seat in the boat and go two on each side walk
out with her till it wa up to our shoulder and gave them a shove
when give wai with their oar thei got her safe into the long
regular swell in the mean time boat had put off from our ship and
the whaler and come all on board the brig togeth thei let go the
other anchor paid out chain brace the yard to the wind and brought
the vessel up
in a few minut the captain came hurri down on the run and
there wa no time to be lost for the gale promis to be a sever on
and the surf wa break upon the beach three deep higher and higher
everi instant the ayacucho boat pull by four kanaka put off
first and as thei had no rudder or steer oar would probabl never
have got off had we not wade out with them as far as the surf would
permit the next that made the attempt wa the whaleboat for we
be the most experienc beachcomb need no help and staid
till the last whalemen make the best boat crew in the world for a
long pull but thi land wa new to them and notwithstand the
exampl thei had had thei slu round and were hove upboat oar
and menaltogeth high and dry upon the sand the second time thei
fill and had to turn their boat over and set her off again we
could be of no help to them for thei were so mani as to be in on
anoth wai without the addit of our number the third time
thei got off though not without ship a sea which drench them
all and half fill their boat keep them bale until thei
reach their ship we now got readi to go off put the boat
head out english ben and i who were the largest stand on each
side of the bow to keep her head on to the sea two more ship
and man the two after oar and the captain take the steer
oar two or three spaniard who stood upon the beach look at us
wrap their cloak about them shook their head and mutter
caramba thei had no tast for such do in fact the hydrophobia
is a nation maladi and show itself in their person as well as
their action
watch for a smooth chanc we determin to show the other boat
the wai it should be done and as soon as our float ran out with
her keep her head on with all our strength and the help of the
captain oar and the two after oarsmen give wai regularli and
strongli until our feet were off the ground we tumbl into the bow
keep perfectli still from fear of hinder the other for some
time it wa doubt how it would go the boat stood nearli up and
down in the water and the sea roll from under her let her fall
upon the water with a forc which seem almost to stave her bottom in
by quietli slide two oar forward along the thwart without
imped the rower we ship two bow oar and thu by the help of
four oar and the captain strong arm we got safe off though we
ship sever sea which left us half full of water we pull
alongsid of the loriott put her skipper on board and found her
make prepar for slip and then pull aboard our own ship
here mr brown alwai on hand had got everyth readi so that we
had onli to hook on the gig and hoist it up when the order wa given
to loos the sail while we were on the yard we saw the loriott
under weigh and befor our yard were masthead the ayacucho had
spread her wing and with yard brace sharp up wa stand athwart
our haws there is no prettier sight in the world than a fullrig
clipperbuilt brig sail sharp on the wind in a moment our
sliprop wa gone the headyard fill awai and we were off next
came the whaler and in a half an hour from the time when four vessel
were ly quietli at anchor without a rag out or a sign of motion
the bai wa desert and four white cloud were stand off to sea
be sure of clear the point we stood off with our yard a littl
brace in while the ayacucho went off with a taut bowlin which
brought her to windward of us dure all thi dai and the greater
part of the night we had the usual southeast entertain a gale
of wind varieg and final top off with a drench rain of
three or four hour at daybreak the cloud thin off and roll
awai and the sun came up clear the wind instead of come out from
the northward as is usual blew steadili and freshli from the
anchoringground thi wa bad for us for be fly light with
littl more than ballast trim we were in no condit for show off
on a taut bowlin and had depend upon a fair wind with which by
the help of our light sail and studdingsail we meant to have been
the first at the anchoringground but the ayacucho wa a good leagu
to windward of us and wa stand in in fine style the whaler
howev wa as far to leeward of us and the loriott wa nearli out
of sight among the island up the canal by haul everi brace and
bowlin and clap watchtackl upon all the sheet and halyard
we manag to hold our own and drop the leeward vessel a littl in
everi tack when we reach the anchoringground the ayacucho had got
her anchor furl her sail squar her yard and wa ly as
quietli as if noth had happen for the last twentyfour hour
we had our usual good luck in get our anchor without let go
anoth and were all snug with our boat at the boomend in half an
hour in about two hour more the whaler came in and made a clumsi
piec of work in get her anchor be oblig to let go her best
bower and final to get out a kedg and a hawser thei were
heaveho stop and unstop pawl cat and fish
for three hour and the sail hung from the yard all the afternoon
and were not furl until sundown the loriott came in just after
dark and let go her anchor make no attempt to pick up the other
until the next dai
thi affair led to a great disput as to the sail of our ship and
the ayacucho bet were made between the captain and the crew took
it up in their own wai but as she wa bound to leeward and we to
windward and merchant captain cannot deviat a trial never took
place and perhap it wa well for us that it did not for the ayacucho
had been eight year in the pacif in everi part of itvalparaiso
sandwich island canton california and all and wa call the
fastest merchantman that trade in the pacif unless it wa the brig
john gilpin and perhap the ship ann mckim of baltimor
saturdai nov 14th thi dai we got under weigh with the agent and
sever spaniard of note as passeng bound up to monterei we went
ashor in the gig to bring them off with their baggag and found them
wait on the beach and a littl afraid about go off as the surf
wa run veri high thi wa nut to us for we like to have a
spaniard wet with salt water and then the agent wa veri much dislik
by the crew on and all and we hope as there wa no offic in the
boat to have a chanc to duck them for we knew that thei were such
marin that thei would not know whether it wa our fault or not
accordingli we kept the boat so far from shore as to oblig them to
wet their feet in get into her and then wait for a good high
comber and let the head slue a littl round sent the whole forc
of the sea into the sternsheet drench them from head to feet the
spaniard sprang out of the boat swore and shook themselv and
protest against try it again and it wa with the greatest
difficulti that the agent could prevail upon them to make anoth
attempt the next time we took care and went off easili enough and
pull aboard the crew came to the side to hoist in their baggag
and we gave them the wink and thei heartili enjoi the halfdrown
look of the compani
everyth be now readi and the passeng aboard we ran up the
ensign and broad pennant for there wa no manofwar and we were the
largest vessel on the coast and the other vessel ran up their
ensign have hove short cast off the gasket and made the bunt of
each sail fast by the jigger with a man on each yard at the word the
whole canva of the ship wa loos and with the greatest rapid
possibl everyth wa sheet home and hoist up the anchor
trip and cathead and the ship under headwai we were determin
to show the spouter how thing could be done in a smart ship with a
good crew though not more than half their number the royal yard
were all cross at onc and royal and skysail set and as we had
the wind free the boom were run out and everi on wa aloft activ
as cat lai out on the yard and boom reev the studdingsail
gear and sail after sail the captain pile upon her until she wa
cover with canva her sail look like a great white cloud rest
upon a black speck befor we doubl the point we were go at a
dash rate and leav the ship far astern we had a fine
breez to take us through the canal as thei call thi bai of forti
mile long by ten wide the breez di awai at night and we were
becalm all dai on sundai about half wai between santa barbara and
point concept sundai night we had a light fair wind which set us
up again and have a fine seabreez on the first part of mondai we
had the prospect of pass without ani troubl point
conceptionth cape horn of california where it begin to blow the
first of januari and blow all the year round toward the latter part
of the afternoon howev the regular northwest wind as usual set
in which brought in our studdingsail and gave us the chanc of
beat round the point which we were now just abreast of and which
stretch off into the pacif high rocki and barren form the
central point of the coast for hundr of mile north and south a
capful of wind will be a bagful here and befor night our royal
were furl and the ship wa labor hard under her topgal
sail at eight bell our watch went below leav her with as much
sail as she could stagger under the water fly over the forecastl
at everi plung it wa evid blow harder but then there wa
not a cloud in the sky and the sun had gone down bright
we had been below but a short time befor we had the usual
premonit of a come gale sea wash over the whole forward part
of the vessel and her bow beat against them with a forc and sound
like the drive of pile the watch too seem veri busi trampl
about deck and sing out at the rope a sailor can alwai tell
by the sound what sail is come in and in a short time we heard
the topgal sail come in on after anoth and then the fly
jib thi seem to eas her a good deal and we were fast go off
to the land of nod whenbang bang bangon the scuttl and all
hand reef topsail ahoi start us out of our berth and it not
be veri cold weather we had noth extra to put on and were soon
on deck i shall never forget the fine of the sight it wa a
clear and rather a chilli night the star were twinkl with an
intens bright and as far as the ey could reach there wa not a
cloud to be seen the horizon met the sea in a defin line a
painter could not have paint so clear a sky there wa not a speck
upon it yet it wa blow great gun from the northwest when you
can see a cloud to windward you feel that there is a place for the
wind to come from but here it seem to come from nowher no person
could have told from the heaven by their eyesight alon that it wa
not a still summer night on reef after anoth we took in the
topsail and befor we could get them hoist up we heard a sound
like a short quick rattl of thunder and the jib wa blown to atom
out of the boltrop we got the topsail set and the fragment of
the jib stow awai and the foretopmast staysail set in it place
when the great mainsail gape open and the sail rip from head to
foot lai up on that mainyard and furl the sail befor it blow to
tatter shout the captain and in a moment we were up gather
the remain of it upon the yard we got it wrap round the yard
and pass gasket over it as snugli as possibl and were just on deck
again when with anoth loud rent which wa heard throughout the
ship the foretopsail which had been doublereef split in two
athwartship just below the reefband from ear to ear here
again it wa down yard haul out reeftackl and lai out upon the
yard for reef by haul the reeftackl chockablock we took
the strain from the other ear and pass the closereef ear
and knot the point carefulli we succeed in set the sail
closereef
we had but just got the rig coil up and were wait to hear go
below the watch when the main royal work loos from the gasket
and blew directli out to leeward flap and shake the mast like a
wand here wa a job for somebodi the royal must come in or be cut
adrift or the mast would be snap short off all the light hand in
the starboard watch were sent up on after anoth but thei could do
noth with it at length john the tall frenchman the head of the
starboard watch and a better sailor never step upon a deck
sprang aloft and by the help of hi long arm and leg succeed
after a hard struggleth sail blow over the yardarm to leeward
and the skysail blow directli over hi headin smother it and
frap it with long piec of sinnet he came veri near be blown
or shaken from the yard sever time but he wa a true sailor everi
finger a fishhook have made the sail snug he prepar to send the
yard down which wa a long and difficult job for frequent he wa
oblig to stop and hold on with all hi might for sever minut
the ship pitch so as to make it imposs to do anyth els at
that height the yard at length came down safe and after it the fore
and mizen royalyard were sent down all hand were then sent aloft
and for an hour or two we were hard at work make the boom well
fast unreev the studdingsail and royal and skysail gear get
rollingrop on the yard set up the weather breastbackstai
and make other prepar for a storm it wa a fine night for a
gale just cool and brace enough for quick work without be cold
and as bright as dai it wa sport to have a gale in such weather as
thi yet it blew like a hurrican the wind seem to come with a
spite an edg to it which threaten to scrape us off the yard the
mere forc of the wind wa greater than i had ever seen it befor but
dark cold and wet ar the worst part of a storm to a sailor
have got on deck again we look round to see what time of night it
wa and whose watch in a few minut the man at the wheel struck
four bell and we found that the other watch wa out and our own half
out accordingli the starboard watch went below and left the ship to
us for a coupl of hour yet with order to stand by for a call
hardli had thei got below befor awai went the foretopmast staysail
blown to ribbon thi wa a small sail which we could manag in the
watch so that we were not oblig to call up the other watch we laid
out upon the bowsprit where we were under water half the time and
took in the fragment of the sail and as she must have some head sail
on her prepar to bend anoth staysail we got the new on out
into the net seiz on the tack sheet and halyard and the
hank man the halyard cut adrift the frap line and hoist
awai but befor it wa half wai up the stai it wa blown all to
piec when we belai the halyard there wa noth left but the
boltrop now larg ey began to show themselv in the foresail
and know that it must soon go the mate order us upon the yard to
furl it be unwil to call up the watch who had been on deck all
night he rous out the carpent sailmak cook steward and other
idler and with their help we man the foreyard and after nearli
half an hour struggl master the sail and got it well furl
round the yard the forc of the wind had never been greater than at
thi moment in go up the rig it seem absolut to pin us
down to the shroud and on the yard there wa no such thing as
turn a face to windward yet here wa no drive sleet and
dark and wet and cold as off cape horn and instead of a stiff
oilcloth suit southwest cap and thick boot we had on hat
round jacket duck trowser light shoe and everyth light and
easi all these thing make a great differ to a sailor when we
got on deck the man at the wheel struck eight bell four oclock in
the morn and all starbowlin ahoi brought the other watch up
but there wa no go below for us the gale wa now at it height
blow like scissor and thumbscrew the captain wa on deck the
ship which wa light roll and pitch as though she would shake
the long stick out of her and the sail gape open and split in
everi direct the mizen topsail which wa a compar new
sail and closereef split from head to foot in the bunt the
foretopsail went in on rent from clew to ear and wa blow to
tatter on of the chain bobstai part the spritsailyard sprung in
the sling the martingal had slu awai off to leeward and ow to
the long dry weather the lee rig hung in larg bight at everi
lurch on of the main topgal shroud had part and to crown
all the gallei had got adrift and gone over to leeward and the
anchor on the lee bow had work loos and wa thump the side
here wa work enough for all hand for half a dai our gang laid out
on the mizen topsail yard and after more than half an hour hard
work furl the sail though it belli out over our head and again
by a slant of the wind blew in under the yard with a fear jerk
and almost threw us off from the footrop
doubl gasket were pass round the yard roll tackl and other
gear bows taut and everyth made as secur as could be come
down we found the rest of the crew just come down the fore rig
have furl the tatter topsail or rather swath it round the
yard which look like a broken limb bandag there wa no sail now
on the ship but the spanker and the closereef main topsail which
still held good but thi wa too much after sail and order wa given
to furl the spanker the brail were haul up and all the light
hand in the starboard watch sent out on the gaff to pass the gasket
but thei could do noth with it the second mate swore at them for a
parcel of soger and sent up a coupl of the best men but thei
could do no better and the gaff wa lower down all hand were now
emploi in set up the lee rig fish the spritsailyard

is expect to come though there is alwai a privat entertain
within the hous for particular friend the old women sat down in
row clap their hand to the music and applaud the young on
the music wa live and among the tune we recogn sever of our
popular air which we without doubt have taken from the spanish in
the danc i wa much disappoint the women stood upright with
their hand down by their side their ey fix upon the ground
befor them and slide about without ani percept mean of motion
for their feet were invis the hem of their dress form a
perfect circl about them reach to the ground thei look as
grave as though thei were go through some religi ceremoni their
face as littl excit as their limb and on the whole instead of
the spirit fascin spanish danc which i had expect i found
the californian fandango on the part of the women at least a lifeless
affair the men did better thei danc with grace and spirit move
in circl round their nearli stationari partner and show their
figur to great advantag
a great deal wa said about our friend don juan bandini and when he
did appear which wa toward the close of the even he certainli
gave us the most grace danc that i had ever seen he wa dress
in white pantaloon neatli made a short jacket of dark silk gaili
figur white stock and thin morocco slipper upon hi veri small
feet hi slight and grace figur wa well calcul for danc
and he move about with the grace and dainti of a young fawn an
occasion touch of the toe to the ground seem all that wa
necessari to give him a long interv of motion in the air at the
same time he wa not fantast or flourish but appear to be
rather repress a strong tendenc to motion he wa loudli
applaud and danc frequent toward the close of the even
after the supper the waltz began which wa confin to a veri few
of the gent de razn and wa consid a high accomplish and
a mark of aristocraci here too don juan figur greatli waltz

figur which last as much as half an hour no on els take the
floor thei were repeatedli and loudli applaud the old men and women
jump out of their seat in admir and the young peopl wave
their hat and handkerchief inde among peopl of the charact of
these mexican the waltz seem to me to have found it right place
the great amus of the eveningwhich i suppos wa ow to it
be carnivalwa the break of egg fill with cologn or other
essenc upon the head of the compani on end of the egg is broken
and the insid taken out then it is partli fill with cologn and
the whole seal up the women bring a great number of these secretli
about them and the amus is to break on upon the head of a
gentleman when hi back is turn he is bound in gallantri to find
out the ladi and return the compliment though it must not be done if
the person see you a tall state don with immens grei whisker
and a look of great import wa stand befor me when i felt a
light hand on my shoulder and turn round saw donna angustia whom
we all knew as she had been up to monterei and down again in the
alert with her finger upon her lip motion me gentli asid i
step back a littl when she went up behind the don and with on
hand knock off hi huge sombrero and at the same instant with the
other broke the egg upon hi head and spring behind me wa out of
sight in a moment the don turn slowli round the cologn run
down hi face and over hi cloth and a loud laugh break out from
everi quarter he look round in vain for some time until the
direct of so mani laugh ey show him the fair offend she
wa hi niec and a great favorit with him so old don domingo had to
join in the laugh a great mani such trick were plai and mani a
war of sharp manoeuv wa carri on between coupl of the younger
peopl and at everi success exploit a gener laugh wa rais
anoth singular custom i wa for some time at a loss about a pretti
young girl wa danc name after what would appear to us the
sacrilegi custom of the countryespiritu santo when a young man
went behind her and place hi hat directli upon her head let it
fall down over her ey and sprang back among the crowd she danc
for some time with the hat on when she threw it off which call
forth a gener shout and the young man wa oblig to go out upon the
floor and pick it up some of the ladi upon whose head hat had
been place threw them off at onc and a few kept them on throughout
the danc and took them off at the end and held them out in their
hand when the owner step out bow and took it from them i
soon began to suspect the mean of the thing and wa afterward told
that it wa a compliment and an offer to becom the ladi gallant for
the rest of the even and to wait upon her home if the hat wa
thrown off the offer wa refus and the gentleman wa oblig to
pick up hi hat amid a gener laugh much amus wa caus
sometim by gentlemen put hat on the ladi head without
permit them to see whom it wa done by thi oblig them to throw
them off or keep them on at a ventur and when thei came to discov
the owner the laugh wa often turn upon them the captain sent for
us about ten oclock and we went aboard in high spirit have
enjoi the new scene much and were of great import among the
crew from have so much to tell and from the prospect of go everi
night until it wa over for these fandango gener last three dai
the next dai two of us were sent up to the town and took care to come
back by wai of capitan noriego and take a look into the booth the
musician were still there upon their platform scrape and twang
awai and a few peopl appar of the lower class were danc
the danc is kept up at interv throughout the dai but the
crowd the spirit and the lite come in at night the next night
which wa the last we went ashor in the same manner until we got
almost tire of the monoton twang of the instrument the drawl
sound which the women kept up as an accompani and the slap
of the hand in time with the music in place of castanet we found
ourselv as great object of attent as ani person or anyth at
the place our sailor dressesand we took great pain to have them
neat and shipshapewer much admir and we were invit from everi
quarter to give them an american sailor danc but after the
ridicul figur some of our countrymen cut in danc after the
spaniard we thought it best to leav it to their imagin our
agent with a tight black swallowtail coat just import from
boston a high stiff cravat look as if he had been pin and
skewer with onli hi feet and hand left free took the floor just
after bandini and we thought thei had had enough of yanke grace
the last night thei kept it up in great style and were get into a
highgo when the captain call us off to go aboard for it be
southeast season he wa afraid to remain on shore long and it wa
well he did not for that veri night we slip our cabl as a

between man and man while at work on deck so that when the steward
came forward with letter for the crew each man took hi letter
carri them below to hi chest and came up again immedi and not
a letter wa read until we had clear up deck for the night
an overstrain sens of manli is the characterist of seafar
men or rather of life on board ship thi often give an appear
of want of feel and even of cruelti from thi if a man come
within an ac of break hi neck and escap it is made a joke of
and no notic must be taken of a bruis or cut and ani express of
piti or ani show of attent would look sisterli and unbecom a
man who ha to face the rough and tumbl of such a life from thi
too the sick ar neglect at sea and whatev sailor mai be ashor
a sick man find littl sympathi or attent forward or aft a man
too can have noth peculiar or sacr on board ship for all the
nicer feel thei take pride in disregard both in themselv and
other a thinskin man could not live an hour on shipboard on
would be torn raw unless he had the hide of an ox a moment of natur
feel for home and friend and then the frigid routin of sealif
return joke were made upon those who show ani interest in the
expect new and everyth near and dear wa made common stock for
rude joke and unfeel coars to which no except could be
taken by ani on

been marri just befor leav boston and dure the voyag had
talk much about hi wife and had to bear and forbear as everi man

thi wa the best consol sail had to offer but it did not seem
to be just the thing the carpent want for dure sever dai he
wa veri much deject and bore with difficulti the joke of the
sailor and with still more difficulti their attempt at advic and
consol of most of which the sailmak wa a good specimen
thursdai feb 25th set sail for santa barbara where we arriv on
sundai the 28th we just miss of see the california for she had
sail three dai befor bound to monterei to enter her cargo and
procur her licens and thenc to san francisco etc captain arthur
left file of boston paper for captain t which after thei had
been read and talk over in the cabin i procur from my friend the
third mate on file wa of all the boston transcript for the month
of august 1835 and the rest were about a dozen daili advertis and
courier of differ date after all there is noth in a strang
land like a newspap from home even a letter in mani respect is
noth in comparison with it it carri you back to the spot
better than anyth els it is almost equal to clairvoy the
name of the street with the thing advertis ar almost as good as
see the sign and while read boi lost on can almost hear the
bell and wellknown voic of old wilson cry the boi as strai
stolen or mislaid then there wa the commenc at cambridg and
the full account of the exercis at the graduat of my own class a
list of all those familiar name begin as usual with abbot and
end with w which as i read them over on by on brought up
their face and charact as i had known them in the variou scene of
colleg life then i imagin them upon the stage speak their
orat dissert colloqui etc with the gestur and tone
of each and tri to fanci the manner in which each would handl hi
subject handsom showi and superfici with hi
strong head clear brain cool selfpossess modest
sensit and underr the mouthpiec of the debat
club noisi vapor and democrat and so follow then i could
see them receiv their a bs from the dignifi feudallook
presid with hi auctorit mihi commiss and walk off the
stage with their diploma in their hand while upon the veri same dai
their classmat wa walk up and down california beach with a hide
upon hi head
everi watch below for a week i pore over these paper until i wa
sure there could be noth in them that had escap my attent and
wa asham to keep them ani longer
saturdai march 5th thi wa an import dai in our almanac for it
wa on thi dai that we were first assur that our voyag wa realli
draw to a close the captain gave order to have the ship readi for
get under weigh and observ that there wa a good breez to take
us down to san pedro then we were not go up to windward thu
much wa certain and wa soon known fore and aft and when we went in
the gig to take him off he shook hand with the peopl on the beach
and said that he never expect to see santa barbara again thi
settl the matter and sent a thrill of pleasur through the heart of
everi on in the boat we pull off with a will sai to ourselv
i can speak for myself at leastgoodbi santa barbarathi is
the last pull hereno more duck in your breaker and slip
from your curs southeast the new wa soon known aboard and
put life into everyth when we were get under weigh each on
wa take hi last look at the mission the town the breaker on the
beach and swear that no monei would make him ship to see them
again and when all hand talli on to the catfal the choru of
time for us to go wa rais for the first time and join in with
full swing by everybodi on would have thought we were on our voyag
home so near did it seem to us though there were yet three month for
us on the coast
we left here the young englishman georg marsh of whom i have befor
spoken who wa wreck upon the pelew island he left us to take the
berth of second mate on board the ayacucho which wa ly in port
he wa well qualifi for thi and hi educ would enabl him to
rise to ani situat on board ship i felt realli sorri to part from
him there wa someth about him which excit my curios for i
could not for a moment doubt that he wa well born and in earli
life well bred there wa the latent gentleman about him and the
sens of honor and no littl of the pride of a young man of good
famili the situat wa offer him onli a few hour befor we
sail and though he must give up return to america yet i have no
doubt that the chang from a dog berth to an offic wa too
agreeabl to hi feel to be declin we pull him on board the
ayacucho and when he left the boat he gave each of it crew a piec of
monei except myself and shook hand with me nod hi head as
much as to sayw understand on anoth and sprang on board had
i known an hour sooner that he wa to leav us i would have made an
effort to get from him the true histori of hi earli life he knew
that i had no faith in the stori which he told the crew and perhap
in the moment of part from me probabl forev he would have given
me the true account whether i shall ever meet him again or whether
hi manuscript narr of hi adventur in the pelew island which
would be credit to him and interest to the world will ever see
the light i cannot tell hi is on of those case which ar more
numer than those suppos who have never live anywher but in their
own home and never walk but in on line from their cradl to their
grave we must come down from our height and leav our straight
path for the bywai and low place of life if we would learn truth
by strong contrast and in hovel in forecastl and among our own
outcast in foreign land see what ha been wrought upon our
fellowcreatur by accid hardship or vice
two dai brought us to san pedro and two dai more to our no small
joi gave us our last view of that place which wa univers call
the hell of california and seem design in everi wai for the wear
and tear of sailor not even the last view could bring out on
feel of regret no thank thought i as we left the sandi shore
in the distanc for the hour i have walk over your stone
barefoot with hide on my headfor the burden i have carri up
your steep muddi hill for the duck in your surf and for the
long dai and longer night pass on your desol hill watch
pile of hide hear the sharp bark of your etern coati and the
dismal hoot of your owl
as i bade goodbi to each success place i felt as though on link
after anoth were struck from the chain of my servitud have kept
close in shore for the landbreez we pass the mission of san juan
campestrno the same night and saw distinctli by the bright
moonlight the hill which i had gone down by a pair of halyard in
search of a few paltri hide forsan et haec olim thought i and
took my last look of that place too and on the next morn we were
under the high point of san diego the flood tide took us swiftli in
and we cameto opposit our hidehous and prepar to get everyth
in trim for a long stai thi wa our last port here we were to
discharg everyth from the ship clean her out smoke her take in
our hide wood water etc and set sail for boston while all thi
wa do we were to lie still in on place and the port wa a safe
on and there wa no fear of southeast accordingli have
pick out a good berth in the stream with a good smooth beach
opposit for a landingplac and within two cabl length of our
hidehous we moor ship unbent all the sail sent down the
topgal yard and all the studdingsail boom and hous the
topgal mast the boat were then hove out and all the sail
spare spar the store the rig not rove and in fact everyth
which wa not in daili us sent ashor and stow awai in the hous
then went all our hide and horn and we left hardli anyth in the
ship but her ballast and thi we made prepar to heav out the
next dai at night after we had knock off and were sit round
in the forecastl smoke and talk and take sailor pleasur we
congratul ourselv upon be in that situat in which we had
wish ourselv everi time we had come into san diego if we were
onli here for the last time we had often said with our topgal
mast hous and our sail unbentand now we had our wish six
week or two month of the hardest work we had yet seen wa befor
us and thengoodbi to california
chapter xxix
load for homea surpriselast of an old friendth last hidea
hard caseup anchor for homehomeward bound
we turnedin earli know that we might expect an earli call and
sure enough befor the star had quit fade all hand ahoi and we
were turnedto heav out ballast a regul of the port forbid
ani ballast to be thrown overboard accordingli our longboat wa
line insid with rough board and brought alongsid the gangwai but
where on tubful went into the boat twenti went overboard thi is
done by everi vessel for the ballast can make but littl differ in
the channel and it save more than a week of labor which would be
spent in load the boat row them to the point and unload
them when ani peopl from the presidio were on board the boat wa
haul up and ballast thrown in but when the coast wa clear she wa
drop astern again and the ballast fell overboard thi is on of
those petti fraud which everi vessel practis in port of inferior
foreign nation and which ar lost sight of among the countless deed
of greater weight which ar hardli less common fortun a sailor
not be a free agent in work aboard ship is not account yet the
fact of be constantli emploi without thought in such thing
beget an indiffer to the right of other
fridai and a part of saturdai we were engag in thi work until we
had thrown out all but what we want under our cargo on the passag
home when as the next dai wa sundai and a good dai for smoke
ship we clear everyth out of the cabin and forecastl made a
slow fire of charcoal birch bark brimston and other matter on the
ballast in the bottom of the hold calk up the hatch and everi open
seam and past over the crack of the window and the slide of the
scuttl and companionwai wherev smoke wa seen come out we
calk and past and so far as we could made the ship smoke tight
the captain and offic slept under the awn which wa spread over
the quarterdeck and we stow ourselv awai under an old
studdingsail which we drew over on side of the forecastl the next
dai from fear that someth might happen order were given for no
on to leav the ship and as the deck were lumber up with
everyth we could not wash them down so we had noth to do all
dai long unfortun our book were where we could not get at them
and we were turn about for someth to do when on man recollect
a book he had left in the gallei he went after it and it prove to
be woodstock thi wa a great windfal and as all could not read it
at onc i be the scholar of the compani wa appoint reader i
got a knot of six or eight about me and no on could have had a more
attent audienc some laugh at the scholar and went over the
other side of the forecastl to work and spin their yarn but i
carri the dai and had the cream of the crew for my hearer mani of
the reflect and the polit part i omit but all the
narr thei were delight with especi the descript of the
puritan and the sermon and harangu of the roundhead soldier
the gallantri of charl dr radcliff plot the knaveri of trusti
tompkinsin fact everi part seem to chain their attent mani
thing which while i wa read i had a misgiv about think
them abov their capac i wa surpris to find them enter into
complet
i read nearli all dai until sundown when as soon as supper wa over
as i had nearli finish thei got a light from the gallei and by
skip what wa less interest i carri them through to the
marriag of everard and the restor of charl the second befor
eight oclock
the next morn we took the batten from the hatch and open the
ship a few stifl rat were found and what bug cockroach
flea and other vermin there might have been on board must have
unrov their lifelin befor the hatch were open the ship be
now readi we cover the bottom of the hold over fore and aft with
dri brush for dunnag and have level everyth awai we were
readi to take in our cargo all the hide that had been collect
sinc the california left the coast a littl more than two year
amount to about forti thousand were cure dri and stow awai
in the hous wait for our good ship to take them to boston
now began the oper of take in our cargo which kept us hard at
work from the grei of the morn till starlight for six week with
the except of sundai and of just time to swallow our meal to
carri the work on quicker a divis of labor wa made two men threw
the hide down from the pile in the hous two more pick them up and
put them on a long horizont pole rais a few feet from the ground
where thei were beaten by two more with flail somewhat like those
us in thresh wheat when beaten thei were taken from thi pole
by two more and place upon a platform of board and ten or a dozen
men with their trowser roll up were constantli go back and
forth from the platform to the boat which wa kept off where she
would just float with the hide upon their head the throw the
hide upon the pole wa the most difficult work and requir a sleight
of hand which wa onli to be got by long practic as i wa known for
a hidecur thi post wa assign to me and i continu at it for
six or eight dai toss in that time from eight to ten thousand
hide until my wrist becam so lame that i gave in and wa
transfer to the gang that wa emploi in fill the boat where i
remain for the rest of the time as we were oblig to carri the
hide on our head from fear of their get wet we each had a piec
of sheepskin sew into the insid of our hat with the wool next to
our head and thu were abl to bear the weight dai after dai which
would otherwis have soon worn off our hair and born hard upon our
skull upon the whole our wa the best berth for though the water
wa nip cold earli in the morn and late at night and be so
continu wet wa rather an exposur yet we got rid of the constant
dust and dirt from the beat of the hide and be all of us young
and hearti did not mind the exposur the older men of the crew whom
it would have been danger to have kept in the water remain on
board with the mate to stow the hide awai as fast as thei were
brought off by the boat
we continu at work in thi manner until the lower hold wa fill to
within four feet of the beam when all hand were call aboard to
commenc steev as thi is a peculiar oper it will requir a
minut descript
befor stow the hide as i have said the ballast is level off
just abov the keelson and then loos dunnag place upon it on which
the hide rest the greatest care is us in stow to make the ship
hold as mani hide as possibl it is no mean art and a man skill
in it is an import charact in california mani a disput have i
heard rage high between profess beachcomb as to whether the
hide should be stow shingl or backtoback and
flippertoflipp upon which point there wa an entir and bitter
divis of sentiment among the savan we adopt each method at
differ period of the stow and parti ran high in the
forecastl some side with old bill in favor of the former and
other scout him and reli upon english bob of the ayacucho
who had been eight year in california and wa will to risk hi
life and limb for the latter method at length a compromis wa
effect and a middl cours of shift the end and back at everi
lai wa adopt which work well and which though thei held it
inferior to their own each parti grant wa better than that of the
other
have fill the ship up in thi wai to within four feet of her
beam the process of steev commenc by which an hundr hide ar
got into a place where on could not be forc by hand and which
press the hide to the utmost sometim start the beam of the
ship resembl in it effect the jackscrew which ar us in
stow cotton each morn we went ashor and beat and brought off
as mani hide as we could steev in the cours of the dai and after
breakfast went down into the hold where we remain at work until
night the whole length of the hold from stem to stern wa floor
off level and we began with rais a pile in the after part hard
against the bulkhead of the run and fill it up to the beam
crowd in as mani as we could by hand and push in with oar when
a larg book wa made of from twentyf to fifti hide doubl at
the back and put into on anoth like the leav of a book an
open wa then made between two hide in the pile and the back of
the outsid hide of the book insert two long heavi spar call
steev made of the strongest wood and sharpen off like a wedg at
on end were place with their wedg end into the insid of the hide
which wa the centr of the book and to the other end of each strap
were fit into which larg tackl were hook compos each of two
huge purchas block on hook to the strap on the end of the steev
and the other into a dog fasten into on of the beam as far aft as
it could be got when thi wa arrang and the wai greas upon
which the book wa to slide the fall of the tackl were stretch
forward and all hand talli on and bows awai until the book wa
well enter when these tackl were nipper strap and toggl
clap upon the fall and two more luff tackl hook on with dog
in the same manner and thu by luff upon luff the power wa
multipli until into a pile in which on hide more could not be
crowd by hand an hundr or an hundr and fifti were often driven
in by thi complic of purchas when the last luff wa hook
on all hand were call to the ropecook steward and alland
rang ourselv at the fall on behind the other sit down on
the hide with our head just even with the beam we set taut upon
the tackl and strike up a song and all ly back at the choru
we bows the tackl home and drove the larg book chock in out of
sight
the sailor song for capstan and fall ar of a peculiar kind
have a choru at the end of each line the burden is usual sung
by on alon and at the choru all hand join inand the louder
the nois the better with us the choru seem almost to rais the
deck of the ship and might be heard at a great distanc ashor a
song is as necessari to sailor as the drum and fife to a soldier
thei cant pull in time or pull with a will without it mani a time
when a thing goe heavi with on fellow yoho a live song like
heav to the girl nanci oh jack crosstre etc ha put
life and strength into everi arm we often found a great differ in
the effect of the differ song in drive in the hide two or
three song would be tri on after the other with no effectnot
an inch could be got upon the tackleswhen a new song struck up
seem to hit the humor of the moment and drove the tackl two
block at onc heav round hearti captain gone ashor and the
like might do for common pull but in an emerg when we want a
heavi raisethedead pull which should start the beam of the ship
there wa noth like time for us to go round the corner or
hurrah hurrah my hearti bulli
thi wa the most live part of our work a littl boat and beach
work in the morn then twenti or thirti men down in a close hold
where we were oblig to sit down and slide about pass hide and
rows about the great steev tackl and dog sing out at the
fall and see the ship fill up everi dai the work wa as hard
as it could well be there wa not a moment cessat from mondai
morn till saturdai night when we were gener beaten out and
glad to have a full night rest a wash and shift of cloth and a
quiet sundai dure all thi timewhich would have startl dr
grahamw live upon almost noth but fresh beef fri beefsteak
three time a daymorn noon and night at morn and night we
had a quart of tea to each man and an allow of about a pound of
hard bread a dai but our chief articl of food wa the beef a mess
consist of six men had a larg wooden kid pile up with beefsteak
cut thick and fri in fat with the greas pour over them round
thi we sat attack it with our jackkniv and teeth and with the
appetit of young lion and sent back an empti kid to the gallei
thi wa done three time a dai how mani pound each man at in a
dai i will not attempt to comput a whole bullock we at liver and
all last us but four dai such devour of flesh i will ventur
to sai wa seldom known befor what on man at in a dai over a
hearti man allow would make a russian heart leap into hi
mouth inde dure all the time we were upon the coast our
princip food wa fresh beef and everi man had perfect health but
thi wa a time of especi devour and what we should have done
without meat i cannot tell onc or twice when our bullock fail
and we were oblig to make a meal upon dry bread and water it seem
like feed upon shave light and dry feel unsatisfi and
at the same time full we were glad to see four quarter of a bullock
just kill swing from the foretop whatev theori mai be
start by sedentari men certainli no men could have gone through more
hard work and exposur for sixteen month in more perfect health and
without ail and fail than our ship crew let them have live
upon hygeia own bake and dress
fridai april 15th arriv brig pilgrim from the windward it wa a
sad sight for her crew to see us get readi to go off the coast
while thei who had been longer on the coast than the alert were
condemn to anoth year hard servic i spent an even on board
and found them make the best of the matter and determin to rough
it out as thei might but my friend s wa determin to go home in
the ship if monei or interest could bring it to pass after
consider negoti and work he succeed in persuad my
english friend tom harrismi companion in the anchor watchfor
thirti dollar some cloth and an intim from captain faucon
that he should want a second mate befor the voyag wa up to take hi
place in the brig as soon as she wa readi to go up to windward
the first opportun i could get to speak to captain faucon i ask
him to step up to the oven and look at hope whom he knew well have
had him on board hi vessel he went to see him but said that he had
so littl medicin and expect to be so long on the coast that he
could do noth for him but that captain arthur would take care of
him when he came down in the california which would be in a week or
more i had been to see hope the first night after we got into san
diego thi last time and had frequent sinc spent the earli part of
a night in the oven i hardli expect when i left him to go to
windward to find him aliv upon my return he wa certainli as low as
he could well be when i left him and what would be the effect of the
medicin that i gave him i hardli then dare to conjectur yet i
knew that he must die without them i wa not a littl rejoic
therefor and reliev upon our return to see him decidedli better
the medicin were strong and took hold and gave a check to the
disord which wa destroi him and more than that thei had begun
the work of extermin it i shall never forget the gratitud that
he express all the kanaka attribut hi escap sole to my
knowledg and would not be persuad that i had not all the secret of
the physic system open to me and under my control my medicin
howev were gone and no more could be got from the ship so that hi
life wa left to hang upon the arriv of the california
sundai april 24th we had now been nearli seven week in san diego
and had taken in the greater part of our cargo and were look out
everi dai for the arriv of the california which had our agent on
board when thi afternoon some kanaka who had been over the hill
for rabbit and to fight rattlesnak came run down the path
sing out kail ho with all their might mr h our third mate
wa ashor and ask them particularli about the size of the sail
etc and learn that it wa mokunui moku hail our ship and
said that the california wa on the other side of the point
instantli all hand were turn up the bow gun run out and load
the ensign and broad pennant set the yard squar by lift and
brace and everyth got readi to make a good appear the
instant she show her nose round the point we began our salut she
came in under topgal sail clew up and furl her sail in good
order and cameto within good swing distanc of us it be
sundai and noth to do all hand were on the forecastl
criticis the newcom she wa a good substanti ship not quit
so long as the alert and wallsid and kettlebottom after the
latest fashion of southshor cotton and sugar wagon strong too and
tight and a good averag sailor but with no pretens to beauti
and noth in the style of a crack ship upon the whole we were
perfectli satisfi that the alert might hold up her head with a ship
twice as smart as she
at night some of us got a boat and went on board and found a larg
roomi forecastl for she wa squarer forward than the alert and a
crew of a dozen or fifteen men and boi sit around on their
chest smoke and talk and readi to give a welcom to ani of our
ship compani it wa just seven month sinc thei left boston which
seem but yesterdai to us accordingli we had much to ask for
though we had seen the newspap that she brought yet these were the
veri men who had been in boston and seen everyth with their own
ey on of the greenhand wa a boston boi from on of the public
school and of cours knew mani thing which we wish to ask about
and on inquir the name of our two boston boi found that thei had
been schoolmat of hi our men had hundr of question to ask
about ann street the boardinghous the ship in port the rate of
wage and other matter
among her crew were two english manofwarsmen so that of cours
we soon had music thei sang in the true sailor style and the rest
of the crew which wa a remark music on join in the
chorus thei had mani of the latest sailor song which had not yet
got about among our merchantmen and which thei were veri choic of
thei began soon after we came on board and kept it up until after two
bell when the second mate came forward and call the alert awai
battlesong drinkingsong boatsong lovesong and everyth
els thei seem to have a complet assort of and i wa glad to
find that all in the down poor tom bowlin the bai of biscai
list ye landsmen and all those classic song of the sea still
held their place in addit to these thei had pick up at the
theatr and other place a few song of a littl more genteel cast
which thei were veri proud of and i shall never forget hear an old
salt who had broken hi voic by hard drink on shore and bellow
from the masthead in a hundr northwest with all manner of
ungovern trill and quaver in the high note break into a
rough falsettoand in the low on growl along like the dy awai
of the boatswain all hand ahoi down the hatchwai sing oh
no we never mention him
perhap like me he struggl with
each feel of regret
but if he love as i have love
he never can forget
the last line be the conclus he roar out at the top of hi
voic break each word up into half a dozen syllabl thi wa veri
popular and jack wa call upon everi night to give them hi
sentiment song no on call for it more loudli than i for the
complet absurd of the execut and the sailor perfect
satisfact in it were ludicr beyond measur
the next dai the california commenc unload her cargo and her
boat crew in come and go sang their boatsong keep time
with their oar thi thei did all dai long for sever dai until
their hide were all discharg when a gang of them were sent on board
the alert to help us steev our hide thi wa a windfal for us for
thei had a set of new song for the capstan and fall and our had got
nearli worn out by six week constant us i have no doubt that thi
time reinforc of song hasten our work sever dai
our cargo wa now nearli all taken in and my old friend the pilgrim
have complet her discharg unmoor to set sail the next morn
on anoth long trip to windward i wa just think of her hard lot
and congratul myself upon my escap from her when i receiv a
summon into the cabin i went aft and there found seat round the
cabin tabl my own captain captain faucon of the pilgrim and mr
r the agent captain t turn to me and ask abruptli
d do you want to go home in the ship
certainli sir said i i expect to go home in the ship
then said he you must get some on to go in your place on board
the pilgrim
i wa so complet taken aback by thi sudden intim that for a
moment i could make no repli i knew that it would be hopeless to
attempt to prevail upon ani of the ship crew to take twelv month
more upon the california in the brig i knew too that captain t
had receiv order to bring me home in the alert and he had told me
when i wa at the hidehous that i wa to go home in her and even if
thi had not been so it wa cruel to give me no notic of the step
thei were go to take until a few hour befor the brig would sail
as soon as i had got my wit about me i put on a bold front and told
him plainli that i had a letter in my chest inform me that he had
been written to by the owner in boston to bring me home in the ship
and moreov that he had told me that i wa to go in the ship
to have thi told him and to be oppos in such a manner wa more
than my lord paramount had been us to
he turn fierc upon me and tri to look me down and face me out
of my statement but find that that wouldnt do and that i wa
enter upon my defenc in such a wai as would show to the other two
that he wa in the wrongh chang hi ground and point to the
ship paper of the pilgrim from which my name had never been
eras and said that there wa my namethat i belong to herthat
he had an absolut discretionari powerand in short that i must be
on board the pilgrim by the next morn with my chest and hammock or
have some on readi to go in my place and that he would not hear
anoth word from me no court or star chamber could proce more
summarili with a poor devil than thi trio wa about to do with me
condemn me to a punish wors than a botani bai exil and to a
fate which would alter the whole current of my futur life for two
year more in california would have made me a sailor for the rest of my
dai i felt all thi and saw the necess of be determin i
repeat what i had said and insist upon my right to return in the
ship
i rais my arm and tauld my crack
befor them a
but it would have all avail me noth had i been some poor bodi
befor thi absolut domin tribun but thei saw that i would
not go unless vi et armi and thei knew that i had friend and
interest enough at home to make them suffer for ani injustic thei
might do me it wa probabl thi that turn the matter for the
captain chang hi tone entir and ask me if in case ani on
went in my place i would give him the same sum that s gave harri
to exchang with him i told him that if ani on wa sent on board the
brig i should piti him and be will to help him to that or almost
ani amount but would not speak of it as an exchang
veri well said he go forward about your busi and send
english ben here to me
i went forward with a light heart but feel as angri and as much
contempt as i could well contain between my teeth english ben wa
sent aft and in a few moment came forward look as though he had
receiv hi sentenc to be hung the captain had told him to get hi
thing readi to go on board the brig the next morn and that i would
give him thirti dollar and a suit of cloth the hand had knock

knew that thi wa too true to be answer but i excus myself from
ani blame and told them that i had a right to go home at all event
thi pacifi them a littl but jack had got a notion that a poor lad
wa to be impos upon and did not distinguish veri clearli and
though i knew that i wa in no fault and in fact had bare escap
the grossest injustic yet i felt that my berth wa get to be a
disagre on the notion that i wa not on of them which by a
particip in all their labor and hardship and have no favor
shown me had been laid asleep wa begin to reviv but far
stronger than ani feel for myself wa the piti i felt for the poor

greater part of hi wage in the slopchest and it wa everi dai a
lose concern to him and like all the rest of the crew he had a
hearti hatr of california and the prospect of eighteen month or two
year more of hidedrogh seem complet to break down hi spirit
i had determin not to go myself happen what would and i knew that
the captain would not dare to attempt to forc me i knew too that
the two captain had agre togeth to get some on and that unless i
could prevail upon somebodi to go voluntarili there would be no help
for ben from thi consider though i had said that i would have
noth to do with an exchang i did my best to get some on to go
voluntarili i offer to give an order upon the owner in boston for

publish in the ship and the case of poor ben wa set forth in strong
color sever who would not have dream of go themselv were
busi in talk it up to other who thei thought might be tempt to
accept it and at length on fellow a harumscarum lad whom we
call harri bluff and who did not care what countri or ship he wa
in if he had cloth enough and monei enoughpartli from piti for
ben and partli from the thought he should have cruis monei for
the rest of hi staycam forward and offer to go and sling hi
hammock in the bloodi hooker lest hi purpos should cool i sign
an order for the sum upon the owner in boston gave him all the
cloth i could spare and sent him aft to the captain to let him know
what had been done the skipper accept the exchang and wa
doubtless glad to have it pass off so easili at the same time he
cash the order which wa endors to him1 and the next morn
the lad went aboard the brig appar in good spirit have shaken

the old brig stand round the point under full sail as she pass
abreast of us we all collect in the waist and gave her three loud
hearti cheer wave our hat in the air her crew sprang into the
rig and chain answer us with three as loud to which we after
the nautic custom gave on in return i took my last look of their
familiar face as thei got over the rail and saw the old black cook
put hi head out of the gallei and wave hi cap over hi head the
crew flew aloft to loos the topgal sail and royal the two
captain wave their hand to on anoth and in ten minut we saw
the last inch of her white canva as she round the point

top of the longboat call all hand into the waist and give us a

and in fact everi sign of have been well born and bred at the
same time there wa someth in hi express which show a slight
defici of intellect how great the defici wa or what it
result from whether he wa born so whether it wa the result of
diseas or accid or whether as some said it wa brought on by hi
distress of mind dure the voyag i cannot sai from hi own
account of himself and from mani circumst which were known in
connect with hi stori he must have been the son of a man of
wealth hi mother wa an italian woman he wa probabl a natur
son for in scarc ani other wai could the incid of hi earli
life be account for he said that hi parent did not live togeth
and he seem to have been ill treat by hi father though he had
been delic brought up and indulg in everi wai and he had then
with him trinket which had been given him at home yet hi educ
had been sadli neglect and when onli twelv year old he wa sent
as midshipman in the compani servic hi own stori wa that he
afterward ran awai from home upon a difficulti which he had with hi
father and went to liverpool whenc he sail in the ship rialto
captain holm for boston captain holm endeavor to get him a
passag back but there be no vessel to sail for some time the boi
left him and went to board at a common sailor boardinghous in ann
street where he support himself for a few week by sell some of
hi valuabl at length accord to hi own account be desir
of return home he went to a shippingoffic where the ship
articl of the california were open upon ask where the ship wa
go he wa told by the shippingmast that she wa bound to
california not know where that wa he told him that he want to
go to europ and ask if california wa in europ the
shippingmast answer him in a wai which the boi did not understand
and advis him to ship the boi sign the articl receiv hi
advanc laid out a littl of it in cloth and spent the rest and
wa readi to go on board when upon the morn of sail he heard
that the ship wa bound upon the northwest coast on a two or three
year voyag and wa not go to europ frighten at thi
prospect he slip awai when the crew wa go aboard wander up
into anoth part of the town and spent all the forenoon in strai
about the common and the neighbor street
have no monei and all hi cloth and other thing be in the
chest on board and be a stranger he becam tire and hungri and
ventur down toward the ship to see if the vessel had sail he
wa just turn the corner of a street when the shippingmast who
had been in search of him pop upon him seiz him and carri him
on board he cri and struggl and said he did not wish to go in
the ship but the topsail were at the masthead the fast just readi
to be cast off and everyth in the hurri and confus of departur
so that he wa hardli notic and the few who did inquir about the
matter were told that it wa mere a boi who had spent hi advanc and
tri to run awai had the owner of the vessel known anyth of the
matter thei would have interf at onc but thei either knew
noth of it or heard like the rest that it wa onli an unruli boi
who wa sick of hi bargain as soon as the boi found himself actual
at sea and upon a voyag of two or three year in length hi spirit
fail him he refus to work and becam so miser that captain
arthur took him into the cabin where he assist the steward and
occasion pull and haul about deck he wa in thi capac
when we saw him and though it wa much better for him than the life in
the forecastl and the hard work watch and exposur which hi
delic frame could not have born yet to be join with a black
fellow in wait upon a man whom he probabl look upon as but
littl in point of educ and manner abov on of hi father
servant wa almost too much for hi spirit to bear had he enter
upon hi situat of hi own free will he could have endur it but
to have been deceiv and in addit to that forc into it wa
intoler he made everi effort to go home in our ship but hi
captain refus to part with him except in the wai of exchang and
that he could not effect if thi account of the whole matter which
we had from the boi and which wa confirm by all the crew be
correct i cannot understand why captain arthur should have refus to
let him go especi be a captain who had the name not onli with
that crew but with all whom he had ever command of an unusu
kindheart man
the truth is the unlimit power which merchant captain have upon
long voyag on strang coast take awai a sens of respons
and too often even in men otherwis welldispos substitut a
disregard for the right and feel of other the lad wa sent on
shore to join the gang at the hidehous from whenc i wa afterward
rejoic to hear he effect hi escap and went down to callao in a
small spanish schooner and from callao he probabl return to
england
soon after the arriv of the california i spoke to captain arthur
about hope and as he had known him on the voyag befor and wa veri
fond of him he immedi went to see him gave him proper medicin
and under such care he began rapidli to recov the saturdai night
befor our sail i spent an hour in the oven and took leav of my
kanaka friend and realli thi wa the onli thing connect with
leav california which wa in ani wai unpleas i felt an interest
and affect for mani of these simpl trueheart men such as i
never felt befor but for a near relat hope shook me by the hand
said he should soon be well again and readi to work for me when i came
upon the coast next voyag as offic of the ship and told me not to
forget when i becam captain how to be kind to the sick old mr
bingham and king mannini went down to the boat with me shook me
heartili by the hand wish us a good voyag and went back to the
oven chant on of their deep monoton song the burden of which
i gather to be about us and our voyag

ourselv gradual shoot ahead of her were on the point of give
her three part cheer when suddenli we found ourselv stop
short and the california rang fast ahead of us a bar stretch
across the mouth of the harbor with water enough to float common
vessel but be low in the water and have kept well to leeward
as we were bound to the southward we had stuck fast while the
california be light had float over
we kept all sail on in the hope of forc over but fail in thi
we hove aback and lai wait for the tide which wa on the flood to
take us back into the channel thi wa somewhat of a damper to us
and the captain look not a littl mortifi and vex thi is the
same place where the rosa got ashor observ the redhead second
mate most malapropo a maledict on the rosa and him too wa
all the answer he got and he slunk off to leeward in a few minut

set swiftli up and the ship bare manag in the light
breez we cameto in our old berth opposit the hidehous whose

that we had return and wa hoveto wait for us off the point
thi time we pass the bar safe and were soon up with the
california who fill awai and kept us compani
she seem desir of a trial of speed and our captain accept the
challeng although we were load down to the bolt of our chain
plate as deep as a sandbarg and bound so taut with our cargo
that we were no more fit for a race than a man in fetterswhil our
antagonist wa in her best trim be clear of the point the breez
becam stiff and the royal mast bent under our sail but we would
not take them in until we saw three boi spring aloft into the rig
of the california when thei were all furl at onc but with order
to stai aloft at the topgal masthead and loos them again at the
word it wa my duti to furl the fore royal and while stand by to
loos it again i had a fine view of the scene from where i stood
the two vessel seem noth but spar and sail while their narrow
deck far below slant over by the forc of the wind aloft
appear hardli capabl of support the great fabric rais upon
them the california wa to windward of us and had everi advantag

halyard rove sail after sail pack upon her until everi avail
inch of canva wa spread that we might not lose a breath of the fair

chapter xxx
begin the long return voyagea scare
at eight oclock all hand were call aft and the watch set for the
voyag some chang were made but i wa glad to find myself still in
the larboard watch our crew wa somewhat diminish for a man and a
boi had gone in the pilgrim anoth wa second mate of the ayacucho
and a third the oldest man of the crew had broken down under the hard
work and constant exposur on the coast and have had a stroke of
the palsi wa left behind at the hidehous under the charg of
captain arthur the poor fellow wish veri much to come home in the
ship and he ought to have been brought home in her but a live dog is
better than a dead lion and a sick sailor belong to nobodi mess so
he wa sent ashor with the rest of the lumber which wa onli in the
wai by these diminut we were shorthand for a voyag round cape
horn in the dead of winter besid s and myself there were onli
five in the forecastl who togeth with four boi in the steerag
the sailmak carpent etc compos the whole crew in addit
to thi we were onli three or four dai out when the sailmak who
wa the oldest and best seaman on board wa taken with the palsi and
wa useless for the rest of the voyag the constant wade in the
water in all weather to take off hide togeth with the other
labor is too much for old men and for ani who have not good
constitut besid these two men of our the second offic of the
california and the carpent of the pilgrim broke down under the work
and the latter di at santa barbara the young man too who came out
with us from boston in the pilgrim had to be taken from hi berth
befor the mast and made clerk on account of a fit of rheumat which
attack him soon after he came upon the coast by the loss of the
sailmak our watch wa reduc to five of whom two were boi who
never steer but in fine weather so that the other two and myself had
to stand at the wheel four hour apiec out of everi twentyfour and
the other watch had onli four helmsmen never mindwer homeward
bound wa the answer to everyth and we should not have mind
thi were it not for the thought that we should be off cape horn in
the veri dead of winter it wa now the first part of mai and two
month would bring us off the cape in juli which is the worst month in
the year there when the sun rise at nine and set at three give
eighteen hour night and there is snow and rain gale and high sea
in abund
the prospect of meet thi in a ship half man and load so deep
that everi heavi sea must wash her fore and aft wa by no mean
pleasant the alert in her passag out doubl the cape in the month
of februari which is midsumm and we came round in the pilgrim in
the latter part of octob which we thought wa bad enough there wa
onli on of our crew who had been off there in the winter and that wa
in a whaleship much lighter and higher than our ship yet he said thei
had mankil weather for twenti dai without intermiss and their
deck were swept twice and thei were all glad enough to see the last
of it the brandywin frigat also in her passag round had sixti
dai off the cape and lost sever boat by the heavi sea all thi
wa for our comfort yet pass it we must and all hand agre to make
the best of it
dure our watch below we overhaul our cloth and made and mend
everyth for bad weather each of us had made for himself a suit of
oilcloth or tarpaulin and these we got out and gave thorough
coat of oil or tar and hung upon the stai to dry
our stout boot too we cover over with a thick mixtur of melt
greas and tar and hung out to dry thu we took advantag of the
warm sun and fine weather of the pacif to prepar for it other face
in the forenoon watch below our forecastl look like the workshop
of what a sailor isa jack at all trade thick stock and
drawer were darn and patch mitten drag from the bottom of the
chest and mend comfort made for the neck and ear old flannel
shirt cut up to line monkei jacket southwest line with flannel
and a pot of paint smuggl forward to give them a coat on the outsid
and everyth turn to hand so that although two year had left us
but a scanti wardrob yet the economi and invent which necess
teach a sailor soon put each of us in pretti good trim for bad
weather even befor we had seen the last of the fine even the
cobbler art wa not out of place sever old shoe were veri
decent repair and with wax end an awl and the top of an old
boot i made me quit a respect sheath for my knife
there wa on difficulti howev which noth that we could do would
remedi and that wa the leak of the forecastl which made it veri
uncomfort in bad weather and render half of the berth
tenantless the tightest ship in a long voyag from the constant
strain which is upon the bowsprit will leak more or less round the
heel of the bowsprit and the bitt which come down into the
forecastl but in addit to thi we had an unaccount leak on
the starboard bow near the cathead which drove us from the forward
berth on that side and inde when she wa on the starboard tack
from all the forward berth on of the after berth too leak in
veri bad weather so that in a ship which wa in other respect as
tight as a bottl and brought her cargo to boston perfectli dry we
had after everi effort made to prevent it in the wai of caulk and
lead a forecastl with onli three dry berth for seven of us
howev as there is never but on watch below at a time by turn
in and out we did pretti well and there be in our watch but
three of us who live forward we gener had a dry berth apiec in
bad weather1
all thi howev wa but anticip we were still in fine weather
in the north pacif run down the northeast trade which we took
on the second dai after leav san diego
sundai mai 15th on week out we were in latitud 14 56 n long
116 14 w have gone by reckon over thirteen hundr mile in
seven dai in fact ever sinc leav san diego we had had a fair
wind and as much as we want of it for seven dai our lower and
topmast studdingsail were set all the time and our royal and
topgal studdingsail whenev she could stagger under them
inde the captain had shown from the moment we got to sea that he
wa to have no boi plai but that the ship had got to carri all she
could and that he wa go to make up by crack on to her what
she want in light in thi wai we frequent made three degre
of latitud besid someth in longitud in the cours of
twentyfour hoursour dai were spent in the usual ship work the
rig which had becom slack from be long in port wa to be set
up breast backstai got up studdingsail boom rig upon the main
yard and the royal studdingsail got readi for the light trade
ringtail set and new rig fit and sail got readi for cape
horn for with a ship gear as well as a sailor wardrob fine
weather must be improv to get readi for the bad to come our
forenoon watch below as i have said wa given to our own work and
our night watch were spent in the usual mannera trick at the
wheel a lookout on the forecastl a nap on a coil of rig under
the lee of the rail a yarn round the windlassend or as wa
gener my wai a solitari walk fore and aft in the weather waist
between the windlassend and the main tack everi wave that she threw
asid brought us nearer home and everi dai observ at noon
show a progress which if it continu would in less than five
month take us into boston bai thi is the pleasur of life at
seafin weather dai after dai without interruptionfair wind
and a plenti of itand homeward bound everi on wa in good humor
thing went right and all wa done with a will at the dog watch all
hand came on deck and stood round the weather side of the forecastl
or sat upon the windlass and sung sea song and those ballad of
pirat and highwaymen which sailor delight in home too and what
we should do when we got there and when and how we should arriv wa
no infrequ topic everi night after the kid and pot were put
awai and we had light our pipe and cigar at the gallei and
gather about the windlass the first question wa
well tom what wa the latitud todai
why fourteen north and she ha been go seven knot ever sinc
well thi will bring us up to the line in five dai
ye but these trade wont last twentyfour hour longer sai an
old salt point with the sharp of hi hand to leewardi know that
by the look of the cloud
then came all manner of calcul and conjectur as to the
continu of the wind the weather under the line the southeast
trade etc and rough guess as to the time the ship would be up
with the horn and some more ventur gave her so mani dai to
boston light and offer to bet that she would not exce it
youd better wait till you get round cape horn sai an old croaker
ye sai anoth you mai see boston but youv got to smell
hell befor that good dai
rumor also of what had been said in the cabin as usual found their
wai forward the steward had heard the captain sai someth about the
strait of magellan and the man at the wheel fanci he had heard him
tell the passeng that if he found the wind ahead and the weather
veri bad off the cape he should stick her off for new holland and
come home round the cape of good hope
thi passengerth first and onli on we had had except to go from
port to port on the coast wa no on els than a gentleman whom i had
known in my better dai and the last person i should have expect to
have seen on the coast of californiaprofessor n of cambridg i
had left him quietli seat in the chair of botani and ornitholog in
harvard univers and the next i saw of him wa stroll about san
diego beach in a sailor peajacket with a wide straw hat and
barefoot with hi trowser roil up to hi knee pick up stone
and shell he had travel overland to the northwest coast and come
down in a small vessel to monterei there he learn that there wa a
ship at the leeward about to sail for boston and take passag in
the pilgrim which wa then at monterei he came slowli down visit
the intermedi port and examin the tree plant earth bird
etc and join us at san diego shortli befor we sail the second
mate of the pilgrim told me that thei had an old gentleman on board who
knew me and came from the colleg that i had been in
he could not recollect hi name but said he wa a sort of an oldish
man with white hair and spent all hi time in the bush and along
the beach pick up flower and shell and such truck and had a
dozen box and barrel full of them i thought over everybodi who
would be like to be there but could fix upon no on when the next
dai just as we were about to shove off from the beach he came down to
the boat in the rig i have describ with hi shoe in hi hand and
hi pocket full of specimen i knew him at onc though i should not
have been more surpris to have seen the old south steepl shoot up
from the hidehous he probabl had no less difficulti in recogn
me as we left home about the same time we had noth to tell on
anoth and ow to our differ situat on board i saw but
littl of him on the passag home sometim when i wa at the wheel
of a calm night and the steer requir no attent and the
offic of the watch wa forward he would come aft and hold a short
yarn with me but thi wa against the rule of the ship as is in
fact all intercours between passeng and the crew i wa often
amus to see the sailor puzzl to know what to make of him and to
hear their conjectur about him and hi busi thei were as much
puzzl as our old sailmak wa with the captain instrument in the
cabin
he said there were threeth chronomet the chrenomet and the
thenomet chronomet baromet and thermomet the pilgrim
crew christen mr n old curiou from hi zeal for curios
and some of them said that he wa crazi and that hi friend let him
go about and amus himself in thi wai why els a rich man sailor
call everi man rich who doe not work with hi hand and wear a long
coat and cravat should leav a christian countri and come to such a
place as california to pick up shell and stone thei could not
understand on of them howev an old salt who had seen someth
more of the world ashor set all to right as he thoughtoh vast
therey dont know anyth about them craft iv seen them
colleg and know the rope thei keep all such thing for
curos and studi em and have men a purpos to go and get em
thi old chap know what he about he ant the child you take him
for hell carri all these thing to the colleg and if thei ar
better than ani that thei have had befor hell be head of the
colleg then byandbi somebodi els will go after some more and
if thei beat him hell have to go again or els give up hi berth
that the wai thei do it thi old covei know the rope he ha
work a travers over em and come wai out here where nobodi ever
been afor and where theyll never think of come thi explan
satisfi jack and as it rais mr ns credit for capac and wa
near enough to the truth for common purpos i did not disturb it
with the except of mr n we had no on on board but the regular
ship compani and the live stock upon thi we had made a
consider inroad we kill on of the bullock everi four dai so
that thei did not last us up to the line we or rather thei then
began upon the sheep and the poultri for these never come into jack
mess2 the pig were left for the latter part of the voyag for
thei ar sailor and can stand all weather we had an old sow on
board the mother of a numer progeni who had been twice round the
cape of good hope and onc round cape horn the last time go
round wa veri nearli her death we heard her squeal and moan
on dark night after it had been snow and hail for sever
hour and get into the sty we found her nearli frozen to death
we got some straw an old sail and other thing and wrap her up in
a corner of the sty where she staid until we got into fine weather

trade had now left us and we had the usual variabl wind which
prevail near the line togeth with some rain so long as we were in
these latitud we had but littl rest in our watch on deck at night
for as the wind were light and variabl and we could not lose a
breath we were all the watch brace the yard and take in and
make sail and humbug with our fly kite a littl puff of
wind on the larboard quarter and thenlarboard fore brace and
studdingboom were rig out studdingsail set alow and aloft the

editor note the 166 in the follow paragraph is clearli an error with 116 actual meant longitud 166 would have put the ship southwest of the sandwich island howev thi print error goe back to at least an 1869 edit of thi book

sailor call an irishman hurricaneright up and down
thi dai it rain nearli all dai and be sundai and noth to do
we stop up the scupper and fill the deck with rain water and
bring all our cloth on deck had a grand wash fore and aft when
thi wa through we strip to our drawer and take piec of soap
and strip of canva for towel we turnedto and soap wash and
scrub on anoth down to get off as we said the california dust
for the common wash in salt water which is all jack can get be on
an allow of fresh had littl efficaci and wa more for tast than
util the captain wa below all the afternoon and we had someth
nearer to a saturnalia than anyth we had yet seen for the mate came
into the scupper with a coupl of boi to scrub him and got into a
battl with them in heav water by unplug the hole we let the
soapsud off the deck and in a short time had a new suppli of rain
water in which we had a grand rins it wa surpris to see how
much soap and fresh water did for the complexion of mani of us how
much of what we suppos to be tan and seablack we got rid of
the next dai the sun rise clear the ship wa cover fore and aft

these trade were the same that in the passag out in the pilgrim
last nearli all the wai from juan fernandez to the line blow
steadili on our starboard quarter for three week without our start
a brace or even brail down the skysail though we had now the
same wind and were in the same latitud with the pilgrim on her
passag out yet we were nearli twelv hundr mile to the westward of
her cours for the captain depend upon the strong southwest wind
which prevail in high southern latitud dure the winter month took
the full advantag of the trade and stood well to the westward so
far that we pass within about two hundr mile of duci island
it wa thi weather and sail that brought to my mind a littl
incid that occur on board the pilgrim while we were in the same
latitud we were go along at a great rate dead befor the wind
with studdingsail out on both side alow and aloft on a dark night
just after midnight and everyth wa as still as the grave except
the wash of the water by the vessel side for be befor the
wind with a smooth sea the littl brig cover with canva wa
do great busi with veri littl nois the other watch wa
below and all our watch except myself and the man at the wheel were
asleep under the lee of the boat the second mate who came out befor
the mast and wa alwai veri thick with me had been hold a yarn
with me and just gone aft to hi place on the quarterdeck and i had
resum my usual walk to and from the windlassend when suddenli we
heard a loud scream come from ahead appar directli from under
the bow the dark and complet still of the night and the
solitud of the ocean gave to the sound a dread and almost
supernatur effect i stood perfectli still and my heart beat quick
the sound woke up the rest of the watch who stood look at on
anoth what in the name of god is that said the second mate
come slowli forward the first thought i had wa that it might be a
boat with the crew of some wreck vessel or perhap the boat of some
whaleship out over night and we had run them down in the dark
anoth scream but less loud than the first thi start us and we
ran forward and look over the bow and over the side to leeward
but noth wa to be seen or heard what wa to be done call the
captain and heav the ship aback just at thi moment in cross
the forecastl on of the men saw a light below and look down the
scuttl saw the watch all out of their berth and afoul of on poor
fellow drag him out of hi berth and shake him to wake him out
of a nightmar
thei had been wake out of their sleep and as much alarm at the
scream as we were and were hesit whether to come on deck when
the second sound come directli from on of the berth reveal the
caus of the alarm the fellow got a good shake for the troubl he
had given we made a joke of the matter and we could well laugh for
our mind were not a littl reliev by it ridicul termin
we were now close upon the southern tropic line and with so fine a
breez were daili leav the sun behind us and draw nearer to
cape horn for which it behov us to make everi prepar our
rig wa all examin and overhaul and mend or replac with

found that there were two hole under it which had been bore for the
purpos of drive treenail and which accident had not been
plug up when the cathead wa place over them thi wa suffici
to account for the leak and for our not have been abl to discov
and stop it

in all american merchantmen whenev a pig is kill the sailor
have on mess from it the rest goe to the cabin the smaller live
stock poultri etc thei never tast
and inde thei do not complain of thi for it would take a great
deal to suppli them with a good meal and without the accompani
which could hardli be furnish to them it would not be much better
than salt beef but even as to the salt beef thei ar scarc dealt
fairli with for whenev a barrel is open befor ani of the beef is
put into the harnesscask the steward come up and pick it all over
and take out the best piec those that have ani fat in them for
the cabin
thi wa done in both the vessel i wa in and the men said that it
wa usual in other vessel inde it is made no secret but some of
the crew ar usual call to help in assort and put awai the
piec by thi arrang the hard dry piec which the sailor
call old hors come to their share
there is a singular piec of rhyme tradit among sailor which
thei sai over such piec of beef i do not know that it ever appear
in print befor when seat round the kid if a particularli bad
piec is found on of them take it up and address it repeat
these line old hors old hors what brought you here

there is a stori current among seamen that a beefdeal wa

each dai and give less and less heat and the night so cold as to
prevent our sleep on deck the magellan cloud in sight of a clear
night the ski look cold and angri and at time a long heavi
ugli sea set in from the southward told us what we were come
to still howev we had a fine strong breez and kept on our wai
under as much sail as our ship would bear toward the middl of the
week the wind haul to the southward which brought us upon a taut
bowlin made the ship meet nearli head on the heavi swell which
roll from that direct and there wa someth not at all
encourag in the manner in which she met it be so deep and
heavi she want the buoyanc which should have carri her over the
sea and she drop heavili into them the water wash over the
deck and everi now and then when an unusu larg sea met her
fairli upon the bow she struck it with a sound as dead and heavi as
that with which a sledgehamm fall upon the pile and took the whole
of it in upon the forecastl and rise carri it aft in the
scupper wash the rig off the pin and carri along with it
everyth which wa loos on deck she had been act in thi wai
all of our forenoon watch below as we could tell by the wash of the
water over our head and the heavi break of the sea against her
bow with a sound as though she were strike against a rock onli
the thick of the plank from our head as we lai in our berth
which ar directli against the bow at eight bell the watch wa
call and we came on deck on hand go aft to take the wheel and
anoth go to the gallei to get the grub for dinner i stood on the
forecastl look at the sea which were roll high as far as the
ey could reach their top white with foam and the bodi of them of a
deep indigo blue reflect the bright rai of the sun our ship rose
slowli over a few of the largest of them until on immens fellow came
roll on threaten to cover her and which i wa sailor enough to
know by the feel of her under my feet she would not rise over
i sprang upon the knighthead and seiz hold of the forestai with
my hand drew myself upon it my feet were just off the stanchion
when she struck fairli into the middl of the sea and it wash her
fore and aft buri her in the water as soon as she rose out of it
i look aft and everyth forward of the mainmast except the
longboat which wa gripe and doublelash down to the ringbolt
wa swept off clear the gallei the pigsti the hencoop and a
larg sheeppen which had been built upon the forehatch were all gone
in the twinkl of an eyeleav the deck as clean as a chin
newreapedand not a stick left to show where thei had stood in the
scupper lai the gallei bottom up and a few board float about
the wreck of the sheeppenand half a dozen miser sheep float
among them wet through and not a littl frighten at the sudden
chang that had come upon them as soon as the sea had wash by all
hand sprung out of the forecastl to see what had becom of the ship
and in a few moment the cook and old bill crawl out from under the
gallei where thei had been ly in the water nearli smother with
the gallei over them fortun it rest against the bulwark or
it would have broken some of their bone when the water ran off we
pick the sheep up and put them in the longboat got the gallei back
in it place and set thing a littl to right but had not our ship
had uncommonli high bulwark and rail everyth must have been wash
overboard not except old bill and the cook
bill had been stand at the galleydoor with the kid of beef in hi
hand for the forecastl mess when awai he went kid beef and all
he held on to the kid till the last like a good fellow but the beef
wa gone and when the water had run off we saw it ly high and dry
like a rock at low tidenoth could hurt that we took the loss of
our beef veri easili consol ourselv with the recollect that
the cabin had more to lose than we and chuckl not a littl at see
the remain of the chickenpi and pancak float in the scupper
thi will never do wa what some said and everi on felt here we
were not yet within a thousand mile of the latitud of cape horn and
our deck swept by a sea not on half so high as we must expect to find
there some blame the captain for load hi ship so deep when he
knew what he must expect while other said that the wind wa alwai
southwest off the cape in the winter and that run befor it we
should not mind the sea so much when we got down into the
forecastl old bill who wa somewhat of a croakerhav met with a
great mani accid at seasaid that if that wa the wai she wa
go to act we might as well make our will and balanc the book at
onc and put on a clean shirt vast there you bloodi old owl
your alwai hang out blue light your frighten by the
duck you got in the scupper and cant take a joke what the us
in be alwai on the lookout for davi jone stand by sai
anoth and well get an afternoon watch below by thi scrape but
in thi thei were disappoint for at two bell all hand were call
and set to work get lash upon everyth on deck and the
captain talk of send down the long topgal mast but as the
sea went down toward night and the wind haul abeam we left them
stand and set the studdingsail
the next dai all hand were turnedto upon unbend the old sail
and get up the new on for a ship unlik peopl on shore put
on her best suit in bad weather the old sail were sent down and
three new topsail and new fore and main cours jib and
foretopmast staysail which were made on the coast and never had been
us were bent with a complet set of new ear roband and
reefpoint and reeftackl were rove to the cours and
spillinglin to the topsail these with new brace and clewlin
fore and aft gave us a good suit of run rig
the wind continu westerli and the weather and sea less rough sinc
the dai on which we ship the heavi sea and we were make great
progress under studdingsail with our light sail all set keep a
littl to the eastward of south for the captain depend upon
westerli wind off the cape had kept so far to the westward that
though we were within about five hundr mile of the latitud of cape
horn we were nearli seventeen hundr mile to the westward of it
through the rest of the week we continu on with a fair wind
gradual as we got more to the southward keep a more easterli
cours and bring the wind on our larboard quarter until
sundai june 26th when have a fine clear dai the captain got a
lunar observ as well as hi meridian altitud which made us in
lat 47 50 s long 113 49 w cape horn bear accord to my
calcul e s e 12 e and distant eighteen hundr mile
mondai june 27th dure the first part of thi dai the wind
continu fair and as we were go befor it it did not feel veri
cold so that we kept at work on deck in our common cloth and round
jacket our watch had an afternoon watch below for the first time
sinc leav san diego and have inquir of the third mate what the
latitud wa at noon and made our usual guess as to the time she
would need to be up with the horn we turnedin for a nap we were
sleep awai at the rate of knot when three knock on the
scuttl and all hand ahoi start us from our berth what could
be the matter it did not appear to be blow hard and look up
through the scuttl we could see that it wa a clear dai overhead
yet the watch were take in sail
we thought there must be a sail in sight and that we were about to
heaveto and speak her and were just congratul ourselv upon
itfor we had seen neither sail nor land sinc we had left portwhen
we heard the mate voic on deck he turnedin all stand and
wa alwai on deck the moment he wa call sing out to the men
who were take in the studdingsail and ask where hi watch were
we did not wait for a second call but tumbl up the ladder and
there on the starboard bow wa a bank of mist cover sea and sky
and drive directli for us i had seen the same befor in my passag
round in the pilgrim and knew what it meant and that there wa no
time to be lost we had noth on but thin cloth yet there wa not
a moment to spare and at it we went
the boi of the other watch were in the top take in the topgal
studdingsail and the lower and topmast studdingsail were come
down by the run it wa noth but haul down and clew up until we
got all the studdingsail in and the royal flyingjib and mizen
topgal sail furl and the ship kept off a littl to take the
squall the fore and main topgal sail were still on her for the
old man did not mean to be frighten in broad daylight and wa
determin to carri sail till the last minut
we all stood wait for it come when the first blast show us
that it wa not be trifl with rain sleet snow and wind enough
to take our breath from us and make the toughest turn hi back to
windward the ship lai nearli over on her beamend the spar and
rig snap and crack and her topgal mast bent like
whipstick clew up the fore and main topgal sail shout
the captain and all hand sprang to the clewlin the deck were
stand nearli at an angl of fortyf degre and the ship go
like a mad steed through the water the whole forward part of her in a
smother of foam the halyard were let go and the yard clew down
and the sheet start and in a few minut the sail smother and
kept in by clewlin and buntlinesfurl em sir ask the
matelet go the topsail halyard fore and aft shout the
captain in answer at the top of hi voic down came the topsail
yard the reeftackl were man and haul out and we climb up
to windward and sprang into the weather rig the violenc of the
wind and the hail and sleet drive nearli horizont across the
ocean seem actual to pin us down to the rig it wa hard work
make head against them on after anoth we got out upon the
yard and here we had work to do for our new sail which had hardli
been bent long enough to get the starch out of them were as stiff as
board and the new ear and reefpoint stiffen with the sleet
knot like piec of iron wire have onli our round jacket and
straw hat on we were soon wet through and it wa everi moment
grow colder our hand were soon stiffen and numb which ad
to the stiff of everyth els kept us a good while on the yard
after we had got the sail haul upon the yard we had to wait a long
time for the weather ear to be pass but there wa no fault to be
found for french john wa at the ear and a better sailor never
laid out on a yard so we lean over the yard and beat our hand upon
the sail to keep them from freez at length the word camehaul
out to leewardand we seiz the reefpoint and haul the band
taut for the lee ear taut bandknot awai and we got the
first reef fast and were just go to lai down whentwo reefstwo
reef shout the mate and we had a second reef to take in the same
wai when thi wa fast we laid down on deck man the halyard to
leeward nearli up to our knee in water set the topsail and then
laid aloft on the main topsail yard and reef that sail in the same
manner for as i have befor state we were a good deal reduc in
number and to make it wors the carpent onli two dai befor
cut hi leg with an ax so that he could not go aloft thi weaken
us so that we could not well manag more than on topsail at a time in
such weather as thi and of cours our labor wa doubl from the
main topsail yard we went upon the main yard and took a reef in the
mainsail no sooner had we got on deck thanlai aloft there
mizentopmen and closereef the mizen topsail thi call me and
be nearest to the rig i got first aloft and out to the weather
ear english ben wa on the yard just after me and took the lee
ear and the rest of our gang were soon on the yard and began to
fist the sail when the mate consider sent up the cook and
steward to help us i could now account for the long time it took to
pass the other ear for to do my best with a strong hand to help
me at the dog ear i could not get it pass until i heard them
begin to complain in the bunt on reef after anoth we took in
until the sail wa closereef when we went down and hoist awai at
the halyard in the mean time the jib had been furl and the
staysail set and the ship under her reduc sail had got more
upright and wa under manag but the two topgal sail were
still hang in the buntlin and slat and jerk as though thei
would take the mast out of her we gave a look aloft and knew that
our work wa not done yet and sure enough no sooner did the mate see
that we were on deck thanlai aloft there four of you and furl the
topgal sail thi call me again and two of us went aloft up
the fore rig and two more up the main upon the topgal yard
the shroud were now ic over the sleet have form a crust or cake
round all the stand rig and on the weather side of the mast
and yard when we got upon the yard my hand were so numb that i
could not have cast off the knot of the gasket to have save my life
we both lai over the yard for a few second beat our hand upon the
sail until we start the blood into our finger end and at the
next moment our hand were in a burn heat my companion on the yard
wa a lad who came out in the ship a weak puni boi from on of the
boston schoolsno larger than a spritsail sheet knot nor heavier
than a paper of lampblack and not strong enough to haul a shad off
a gridiron but who wa now as long as a spare topmast strong enough
to knock down an ox and hearti enough to eat him we fist the sail
togeth and after six or eight minut of hard haul and pull
and beat down the sail which wa as stiff as sheet iron we manag
to get it furl and snugli furl it must be for we knew the mate
well enough to be certain that if it got adrift again we should be
call up from our watch below at ani hour of the night to furl it
i had been on the lookout for a moment to jump below and clap on a
thick jacket and southwest but when we got on deck we found that
eight bell had been struck and the other watch gone below so that
there were two hour of dog watch for us and a plenti of work to do
it had now set in for a steadi gale from the southwest but we were
not yet far enough to the southward to make a fair wind of it for we
must give terra del fuego a wide berth the deck were cover with
snow and there wa a constant drive of sleet in fact cape horn had
set in with good earnest in the midst of all thi and befor it
becam dark we had all the studdingsail to make up and stow awai
and then to lai aloft and rig in all the boom fore and aft and coil
awai the tack sheet and halyard thi wa pretti tough work for
four or five hand in the face of a gale which almost took us off the
yard and with rope so stiff with ic that it wa almost imposs
to bend them i wa nearli half an hour out on the end of the fore
yard try to coil awai and stop down the topmast studdingsail tack
and lower halyard it wa after dark when we got through and we were
not a littl pleas to hear four bell struck which sent us below for
two hour and gave us each a pot of hot tea with our cold beef and
bread and what wa better yet a suit of thick dry cloth fit
for the weather in place of our thin cloth which were wet through
and now frozen stiff
thi sudden turn for which we were so littl prepar wa as
unaccept to me as to ani of the rest for i had been troubl for
sever dai with a slight toothach and thi cold weather and
wet and freez were not the best thing in the world for it
i soon found that it wa get strong hold and run over all
part of my face and befor the watch wa out i went aft to the mate
who had charg of the medicinechest to get someth for it
but the chest show like the end of a long voyag for there wa
noth that would answer but a few drop of laudanum which must be
save for ani emerg so i had onli to bear the pain as well as i
could
when we went on deck at eight bell it had stop snow and there
were a few star out but the cloud were still black and it wa
blow a steadi gale just befor midnight i went aloft and sent
down the mizen royal yard and had the good luck to do it to the
satisfact of the mate who said it wa done out of hand and
shipshap the next four hour below were but littl relief to me
for i lai awak in my berth the whole time from the pain in my face
and heard everi bell strike and at four oclock turn out with the
watch feel littl spirit for the hard duti of the dai
bad weather and hard work at sea can be born up against veri well if
on onli ha spirit and health but there is noth bring a man down
at such a time like bodili pain and want of sleep
there wa howev too much to do to allow time to think for the gale
of yesterdai and the heavi sea we met with a few dai befor while
we had yet ten degre more south to make had convinc the captain
that we had someth befor us which wa not to be trifl with and
order were given to send down the long topgal mast the
topgal and royal yard were accordingli struck the fly
jibboom rig in and the topgal mast sent down on deck and
all lash togeth by the side of the longboat
the rig wa then sent down and coil awai below and everyth
wa made snug aloft there wa not a sailor in the ship who wa not
rejoic to see these stick come down for so long as the yard were
aloft on the least sign of a lull the topgal sail were loos
and then we had to furl them again in a snowsqual and shin up and
down singl rope cake with ic and send royal yard down in the
teeth of a gale come right from the south pole it wa an
interest sight too to see our nobl ship dismantl of all her
tophamp of long taper mast and yard and boom point with
spearhead which ornament her in port and all that canva which a
few dai befor had cover her like a cloud from the truck to the
water edg spread far out beyond her hull on either side now
gone and she strip like a wrestler for the fight it
correspond too with the desol charact of her
situationalon as she wa battl with storm wind and ic at
thi extrem of the globe and in almost constant night
fridai juli 1st we were now nearli up to the latitud of cape horn
and have over forti degre of east to make we squar awai the
yard befor a strong westerli gale shook a reef out of the
foretopsail and stood on our wai eastbysouth with the prospect of
be up with the cape in a week or ten dai as for myself i had had
no sleep for fortyeight hour and the want of rest togeth with
constant wet and cold had increas the swell so that my face wa
nearli as larg as two and i found it imposs to get my mouth open
wide enough to eat in thi state the steward appli to the captain
for some rice to boil for me but he onli got ano d you tell
him to eat salt junk and hard bread like the rest of them for thi
of cours i wa much oblig to him and in truth it wa just what i
expect howev i did not starv for the mate who wa a man as
well as a sailor and had alwai been a good friend to me smuggl a
pan of rice into the gallei and told the cook to boil it for me and
not let the old man see it had it been fine weather or in port i
should have gone below and lain by until my face got well but in such
weather as thi and shorthand as we were it wa not for me to
desert my post so i kept on deck and stood my watch and did my duti
as well as i could
saturdai juli 2nd thi dai the sun rose fair but it ran too low in
the heaven to give ani heat or thaw out our sail and rig yet
the sight of it wa pleasant and we had a steadi reef topsail breez
from the westward the atmospher which had previous been clear and
cold for the last few hour grew damp and had a disagre wet
chilli in it and the man who came from the wheel said he heard the
captain tell the passeng that the thermomet had fallen sever
degre sinc morn which he could not account for in ani other wai
than by suppos that there must be ic near us though such a thing
had never been heard of in thi latitud at thi season of the year
at twelv oclock we went below and had just got through dinner when
the cook put hi head down the scuttl and told us to come on deck and
see the finest sight that we had ever seen where awai cook ask
the first man who wa up on the larboard bow and there lai
float in the ocean sever mile off an immens irregular mass
it top and point cover with snow and it center of a deep indigo
color
thi wa an iceberg and of the largest size as on of our men said
who had been in the northern ocean as far as the ey could reach the
sea in everi direct wa of a deep blue color the wave run high
and fresh and sparkl in the light and in the midst lai thi
immens mountainisland it caviti and vallei thrown into deep
shade and it point and pinnacl glitter in the sun
all hand were soon on deck look at it and admir in variou
wai it beauti and grandeur but no descript can give ani idea of
the strang splendor and realli the sublim of the sight
it great sizefor it must have been from two to three mile in
circumfer and sever hundr feet in heightit slow motion as
it base rose and sank in the water and it high point nod against
the cloud the dash of the wave upon it which break high with
foam line it base with a white crust and the thunder sound of
the crack of the mass and the break and tumbl down of huge
piec togeth with it near and approach which ad a slight
element of fearal combin to give to it the charact of true
sublim the main bodi of the mass wa as i have said of an indigo
color it base crust with frozen foam and as it grew thin and
transpar toward the edg and top it color shade off from a deep
blue to the white of snow
it seem to be drift slowli toward the north so that we kept awai
and avoid it it wa in sight all the afternoon and when we got to
leeward of it the wind di awai so that we layto quit near it for
a greater part of the night unfortun there wa no moon but it
wa a clear night and we could plainli mark the long regular heav
of the stupend mass as it edg move slowli against the star
sever time in our watch loud crack were heard which sound as
though thei must have run through the whole length of the iceberg and
sever piec fell down with a thunder crash plung heavili into
the sea toward morn a strong breez sprang up and we fill
awai and left it astern and at daylight it wa out of sight the
next dai which wa
sundai juli 3d the breez continu strong the air exceedingli
chilli and the thermomet low in the cours of the dai we saw
sever iceberg of differ size but none so near as the on which
we saw the dai befor some of them as well as we could judg at the
distanc at which we were must have been as larg as that if not
larger at noon we were in latitud 55 12 south and suppos
longitud 89 5 west toward night the wind haul to the southward
and head us off our cours a littl and blew a tremend gale but
thi we did not mind as there wa no rain nor snow and we were
alreadi under close sail
mondai juli 4th thi wa independ dai in boston what fire
of gun and ring of bell and rejoic of all sort in everi
part of our countri the ladi who have not gone down to nahant for
a breath of cool air and sight of the ocean walk the street with
parasol over their head and the dandi in their white pantaloon
and silk stock what quantiti of icecream have been eaten and
what quantiti of ic brought into the citi from a distanc and sold
out by the lump and the pound the smallest of the island which we
saw todai would have made the fortun of poor jack if he had had it in
boston and i dare sai he would have had no object to be there
with it thi to be sure wa no place to keep the fourth of juli
to keep ourselv warm and the ship out of the ic wa as much as we
could do yet no on forgot the dai and mani were the wish and
conjectur and comparison both seriou and ludicr which were
made among all hand the sun shone bright as long as it wa up onli
that a scud of black cloud wa ever and anon drive across it at
noon we were in lat 54 27 s and long 85 5 w have made a
good deal of east but have lost in our latitud by the head of
the wind between daylight and darkthat is between nine oclock and
threew saw thirtyfour ic island of variou size some no bigger
than the hull of our vessel and other appar nearli as larg as
the on that we first saw though as we went on the island becam
smaller and more numer and at sundown of thi dai a man at the
masthead saw larg field of float ic call fieldic at the
southeast thi kind of ic is much more danger than the larg
island for those can be seen at a distanc and kept awai from but
the fieldic float in great quantiti and cover the ocean for
mile and mile in piec of everi sizelarg flat and broken
cake with here and there an island rise twenti and thirti feet and
as larg as the ship hullthi it is veri difficult to sheer clear
of a constant lookout wa necessari for ani of these piec come
with the heav of the sea were larg enough to have knock a hole in
the ship and that would have been the end of us for no boat even if
we could have got on out could have live in such a sea and no man
could have live in a boat in such weather to make our condit
still wors the wind came out due east just after sundown and it
blew a gale dead ahead with hail and sleet and a thick fog so that
we could not see half the length of the ship our chief relianc the
prevail westerli gale wa thu cut off and here we were nearli
seven hundr mile to the westward of the cape with a gale dead from
the eastward and the weather so thick that we could not see the ic
with which we were surround until it wa directli under our bow
at four p m it wa then quit dark all hand were call and sent
aloft in a violent squall of hail and rain to take in sail we had
now all got on our cape horn rigthick boot southwest come
down over our neck and ear thick trowser and jacket and some with
oilcloth suit over all mitten too we wore on deck but it would
not do to go aloft with them on for it wa imposs to work with
them and be wet and stiff thei might let a man slip overboard
for all the hold he could get upon a rope so we were oblig to work
with bare hand which as well as our face were often cut with the
hailston which fell thick and larg our ship wa now all case
with icehul spar and stand riggingand the run rig
so stiff that we could hardli bend it so as to belai it or still
wors take a knot with it and the sail nearli as stiff as sheet
iron on at a time for it wa a long piec of work and requir
mani hand we furl the cours mizen topsail and foretopmast
staysail and closereef the fore and main topsail and hove the
ship to under the fore with the main haul up by the clewlin and
buntlin and readi to be sheet home if we found it necessari to
make sail to get to windward of an ic island a regular lookout wa
then set and kept by each watch in turn until the morn it wa a
tediou and anxiou night it blew hard the whole time and there wa
an almost constant drive of either rain hail or snow in addit
to thi it wa as thick as muck and the ic wa all about us the
captain wa on deck nearli the whole night and kept the cook in the
gallei with a roar fire to make coffe for him which he took
everi few hour and onc or twice gave a littl to hi offic but
not a drop of anyth wa there for the crew the captain who sleep
all the daytim and come and goe at night as he choos can have
hi brandi and water in the cabin and hi hot coffe at the gallei
while jack who ha to stand through everyth and work in wet and
cold can have noth to wet hi lip or warm hi stomach
thi wa a temper ship and like too mani such ship the
temper wa all in the forecastl the sailor who onli take hi
on glass as it is dealt out to him is in danger of be drunk while
the captain who ha all under hi hand and can drink as much as he
choos and upon whose selfpossess and cool judgment the live of
all depend mai be trust with ani amount to drink at hi will
sailor will never be convinc that rum is a danger thing by
take it awai from them and give it to the offic nor that that
temper is their friend which take from them what thei have alwai
had and give them noth in the place of it by see it allow
to their offic thei will not be convinc that it is taken from
them for their good and by receiv noth in it place thei will
not believ that it is done in kind on the contrari mani of them
look upon the chang as a new instrument of tyranni not that thei
prefer rum i never knew a sailor in my life who would not prefer a
pot of hot coffe or chocol in a cold night to all the rum afloat
thei all sai that rum onli warm them for a time yet if thei can get
noth better thei will miss what thei have lost the momentari
warmth and glow from drink it the break and chang which is made in
a long dreari watch by the mere call all hand aft and serv of
it out and the simpli have some event to look forward to and to
talk about give it an import and a us which no on can appreci
who ha not stood hi watch befor the mast on my passag round cape
horn befor the vessel that i wa in wa not under temper
articl and grog wa serv out everi middl and morn watch and
after everi reef of topsail and though i had never drank rum
befor and never intend to again i took my allow then at the
capstan as the rest did mere for the momentari warmth it gave the
system and the chang in our feel and aspect of our duti on the
watch at the same time as i have state there wa not a man on
board who would not have pitch the rum to the dog i have heard
them sai so a dozen time for a pot of coffe or chocol or even
for our common beveragewat bewitch and tea begrudg as it
was1
the temper reform is the best thing that ever wa undertaken for
the sailor but when the grog is taken from him he ought to have
someth in it place as it is now in most vessel it is a mere
save to the owner and thi account for the sudden increas of
temper ship which surpris even the best friend of the caus
if everi merchant when he struck grog from the list of the expens of
hi ship had been oblig to substitut as much coffe or chocol
as would give each man a potful when he came off the topsail yard on
a stormi nighti fear jack might have gone to ruin on the old
road2 but thi is not doubl cape horn eight hour of the
night our watch wa on deck and dure the whole of that time we kept
a bright lookout on man on each bow anoth in the bunt of the fore
yard the third mate on the scuttl on on each quarter and a man
alwai stand by the wheel the chief mate wa everywher and
command the ship when the captain wa below
when a larg piec of ic wa seen in our wai or drift near us the
word wa pass along and the ship head turn on wai and anoth
and sometim the yard squar or brace up there wa littl els to
do than to look out and we had the sharpest ey in the ship on the
forecastl the onli varieti wa the monoton voic of the lookout
forwardanoth islandic aheadic on the lee bowhard
up the helmkeep her off a littlesteadi
in the meantim the wet and cold had brought my face into such a state
that i could neither eat nor sleep and though i stood it out all
night yet when it becam light i wa in such a state that all hand
told me i must go below and liebi for a dai or two or i should be
laid up for a long time and perhap have the lockjaw
when the watch wa chang i went into the steerag and took off my
hat and comfort and show my face to the mate who told me to go
below at onc and stai in my berth until the swell went down and
gave the cook order to make a poultic for me and said he would speak
to the captain
i went below and turnedin cover myself over with blanket and
jacket and lai in my berth nearli twentyfour hour half asleep and
half awak stupid from the dull pain i heard the watch call and
the men go up and down and sometim a nois on deck and a cry of
ic but i gave littl attent to anyth at the end of
twentyfour hour the pain went down and i had a long sleep which
brought me back to my proper state yet my face wa so swollen and
tender that i wa oblig to keep to my berth for two or three dai
longer dure the two dai i had been below the weather wa much the
same that it had been head wind and snow and rain or if the wind
came fair too foggi and the ic too thick to run at the end of the
third dai the ic wa veri thick a complet fogbank cover the ship
it blew a tremend gale from the eastward with sleet and snow and
there wa everi promis of a danger and fatigu night at dark
the captain call all hand aft and told them that not a man wa to
leav the deck that night that the ship wa in the greatest danger
ani cake of ic might knock a hole in her or she might run on an
island and go to piec no on could tell whether she would be a ship
the next morn the lookout were then set and everi man wa put
in hi station when i heard what wa the state of thing i began to
put on my cloth to stand it out with the rest of them when the mate
came below and look at my face order me back to my berth sai
that if we went down we should all go down togeth but if i went on
deck i might lai myself up for life thi wa the first word i had
heard from aft for the captain had done noth nor inquir how i
wa sinc i went below
in obedi to the mate order i went back to my berth but a more
miser night i never wish to spend i never felt the curs of
sick so keenli in my life if i could onli have been on deck with
the rest where someth wa to be done and seen and heard where
there were fellowb for companion in duti and dangerbut to be
coop up alon in a black hole in equal danger but without the power
to do wa the hardest trial sever time in the cours of the
night i got up determin to go on deck but the silenc which show
that there wa noth do and the knowledg that i might make
myself serious ill for noth kept me back it wa not easi to
sleep ly as i did with my head directli against the bow which
might be dash in by an island of ic brought down by the veri next
sea that struck her thi wa the onli time i had been ill sinc i
left boston and it wa the worst time it could have happen i felt
almost will to bear the plagu of egypt for the rest of the voyag
if i could but be well and strong for that on night yet it wa a
dread night for those on deck
a watch of eighteen hour with wet and cold and constant anxieti
nearli wore them out and when thei came below at nine oclock for
breakfast thei almost drop asleep on their chest and some of them
were so stiff that thei could with difficulti sit down not a drop of
anyth had been given them dure the whole time though the
captain as on the night that i wa on deck had hi coffe everi four
hour except that the mate stole a pot of coffe for two men to
drink behind the gallei while he kept a lookout for the captain
everi man had hi station and wa not allow to leav it and noth
happen to break the monotoni of the night except onc set the
main topsail to run clear of a larg island to leeward which thei
were drift fast upon some of the boi got so sleepi and stupefi
that thei actual fell asleep at their post and the young third
mate whose station wa the expos on of stand on the fore
scuttl wa so stiff when he wa reliev that he could not bend hi
knee to get down by a constant lookout and a quick shift of the
helm as the island and piec came in sight the ship went clear of
everyth but a few small piec though daylight show the ocean
cover for mile at daybreak it fell a dead calm and with the sun
the fog clear a littl and a breez sprung up from the westward
which soon grew into a gale we had now a fair wind daylight and
compar clear weather yet to the surpris of everi on the
ship continu hoveto why doe not he run what is the captain
about wa ask by everi on and from question it soon grew into
complaint and murmur when the daylight wa so short it wa too
bad to lose it and a fair wind too which everi on had been prai
for as hour follow hour and the captain show no sign of make
sail the crew becam impati and there wa a good deal of talk
and consult togeth on the forecastl thei had been beaten out
with the exposur and hardship and impati to get out of it and
thi unaccount delai wa more than thei could bear in quiet in
their excit and restless state some said that the captain wa
frightenedcomplet cow by the danger and difficulti that
surround us and wa afraid to make sail while other said that in
hi anxieti and suspens he had made a free us of brandi and opium
and wa unfit for hi duti the carpent who wa an intellig man
and a thorough seaman and had great influenc with the crew came down
into the forecastl and tri to induc the crew to go aft and ask the
captain why he did not run or request him in the name of all hand
to make sail thi appear to be a veri reason request and the
crew agre that if he did not make sail befor noon thei would go
aft noon came and no sail wa made a consult wa held again
and it wa propos to take the ship from the captain and give the
command of her to the mate who had been heard to sai that if he could
have hi wai the ship would have been half the distanc to the cape
befor nightic or no ic and so irrit and impati had the
crew becom that even thi proposit which wa open mutini
punish with state prison wa entertain and the carpent went
to hi berth leav it tacitli understood that someth seriou
would be done if thing remain as thei were mani hour longer when
the carpent left we talk it all over and i gave my advic
strongli against it anoth of the men too who had known someth
of the kind attempt in anoth ship by a crew who were dissatisfi
with their captain and which wa follow with seriou consequ
wa oppos to it s who soon came down join us and we
determin to have noth to do with it by these mean thei were
soon induc to give it up for the present though thei said thei
would not lie where thei were much longer without know the reason
the affair remain in thi state until four oclock when an order
came forward for all hand to come aft upon the quarterdeck in about
ten minut thei came forward again and the whole affair had been
blown the carpent veri prematur and without ani author from
the crew had sound the mate as to whether he would take command of
the ship and intim an intent to displac the captain and the
mate as in duti bound had told the whole to the captain who
immedi sent for all hand aft instead of violent measur or
at least an outbreak of quarterdeck bravado threat and abus
which thei had everi reason to expect a sens of common danger and
common suffer seem to have tame hi spirit and begotten
someth like a human fellowfeel for he receiv the crew in a
manner quiet and even almost kind he told them what he had heard
and said that he did not believ that thei would try to do ani such
thing as wa intim that thei had alwai been good menobedi
and knew their duti and he had no fault to find with them and ask
them what thei had to complain ofsaid that no on could sai that he
wa slow to carri sail which wa true enough and that as soon as
he thought it wa safe and proper he should make sail he ad a few
word about their duti in their present situat and sent them
forward sai that he should take no further notic of the matter
but at the same time told the carpent to recollect whose power he
wa in and that if he heard anoth word from him he would have caus
to rememb him to the dai of hi death
thi languag of the captain had a veri good effect upon the crew and
thei return quietli to their duti
for two dai more the wind blew from the southward and eastward or in
the short interv when it wa fair the ic wa too thick to run yet
the weather wa not so dreadfulli bad and the crew had watch and
watch i still remain in my berth fast recov yet still not
well enough to go safe on deck and i should have been perfectli
useless for from have eaten noth for nearli a week except a
littl rice which i forc into my mouth the last dai or two i wa as
weak as an infant to be sick in a forecastl is miser inde it
is the worst part of a dog life especi in bad weather the
forecastl shut up tight to keep out the water and cold airth
watch either on deck or asleep in their berthsno on to speak
toth pale light of the singl lamp swing to and fro from the
beam so dim that on can scarc see much less read by itth
water drop from the beam and carlin and run down the side
and the forecastl so wet and dark and cheerless and so lumber up
with chest and wet cloth that sit up is wors than ly in the
berth these ar some of the evil fortun i need no help
from ani on and no medicin and if i had need help i dont know
where i should have found it sailor ar will enough but it is
true as is often saidno on ship for nurs on board a vessel our
merchant ship ar alwai underman and if on man is lost by
sick thei cannot spare anoth to take care of him a sailor is
alwai presum to be well and if he sick he a poor dog on ha
to stand hi wheel and anoth hi lookout and the sooner he get on
deck again the better
accordingli as soon as i could possibl go back to my duti i put on
my thick cloth and boot and southwest and made my appear on
deck though i had been but a few dai below yet everyth look
strang enough the ship wa case in icedeck side mast
yard and rig two closereef topsail were all the sail she
had on and everi sail and rope wa frozen so stiff in it place that
it seem as though it would be imposs to start anyth reduc
too to her topmast she had altogeth a most forlorn and crippl
appear the sun had come up brightli the snow wa swept off the
deck and ash thrown upon them so that we could walk for thei had
been as slipperi as glass
it wa of cours too cold to carri on ani ship work and we had
onli to walk the deck and keep ourselv warm the wind wa still
ahead and the whole ocean to the eastward cover with island and
fieldic at four bell the order wa given to squar awai the yard
and the man who came from the helm said that the captain had kept her
off to n n e what could thi mean some said that he wa go to
put into valparaiso and winter and other that he wa go to run
out of the ic and cross the pacif and go home round the cape of
good hope soon howev it leak out and we found that we were
run for the strait of magellan the new soon spread through the
ship and all tongu were at work talk about it no on on board
had been through the strait but i had in my chest an account of the
passag of the ship a j donelson of new york through those strait
a few year befor
the account wa given by the captain and the represent wa as
favor as possibl it wa soon read by everi on on board and
variou opinion pronounc the determin of our captain had at
least thi good effect it gave everi on someth to think and talk
about made a break in our life and divert our mind from the
monoton dreari of the prospect befor us have made a fair
wind of it we were go off at a good rate and leav the thickest
of the ic behind us thi at least wa someth
have been long enough below to get my hand well warm and soften
the first handl of the rope wa rather tough but a few dai
harden them and as soon as i got my mouth open wide enough to take
in a piec of salt beef and hard bread i wa all right again
sundai juli 10th lat 54 10 long 79 07 thi wa our posit
at noon the sun wa out bright the ic wa all left behind and
thing had quit a cheer appear we brought our wet peajacket
and trowser on deck and hung them up in the rig that the breez
and the few hour of sun might dry them a littl and by the
permiss of the cook the gallei wa nearli fill with stock and
mitten hung round to be dri boot too were brought up and
have got a littl tar and slush from below we gave them a thick
coat after dinner all hand were turnedto to get the anchor over
the bow bend on the chain etc the fishtackl wa got up
fishdavit rig out and after two or three hour of hard and cold
work both the anchor were readi for instant us a coupl of kedg
got up a hawser coil awai upon the forehatch and the
deepsealeadlin overhaul and got readi our spirit return with
have someth to do and when the tackl wa man to bows the
anchor home notwithstand the desol of the scene we struck up
cheerili ho in full choru thi pleas the mate who rub hi
hand and cri outthat right my boi never sai die that sound
like the old crew and the captain came up on hear the song and
said to the passeng within hear of the man at the wheelthat
sound like a live crew theyll have their song so long as therer
enough left for a choru
thi prepar of the cabl and anchor wa for the passag of the
strait for be veri crook and with a varieti of current it is
necessari to come frequent to anchor thi wa not by ani mean a
pleasant prospect for of all the work that a sailor is call upon to
do in cold weather there is none so bad as work the groundtackl
the heavi chain cabl to be haul and pull about the deck with
bare hand wet hawser sliprop and buoyrop to be haul
aboard drip in water which is run up your sleev and
freez clear haws under the bow get under weigh and
comingto at all hour of the night and dai and a constant lookout
for rock and sand and turn of tidesthes ar some of the
disagre of such a navig to a common sailor fair or foul
he want to have noth to do with the groundtackl between port and
port on of our hand too had unluckili fallen upon a half of an
old newspap which contain an account of the passag through the
strait of a boston brig call i think the peruvian in which she
lost everi cabl and anchor she had got aground twice and arriv at
valparaiso in distress thi wa set off against the account of the a
j donelson and led us to look forward with less confid to the
passag especi as no on on board had ever been through and the
captain had no veri perfect chart howev we were spare ani
further experi on the point for the next dai when we must have
been near the cape of pillar which is the southwest point of the
mouth of the strait a gale set in from the eastward with a heavi
fog so that we could not see half of the ship length ahead thi of
cours put an end to the project for the present for a thick fog and
a gale blow dead ahead ar not the most favor circumst for
the passag of difficult and danger strait thi weather too
seem like to last for some time and we could not think of beat
about the mouth of the strait for a week or two wait for a
favor opportun so we brace up on the larboard tack put the
ship head due south and struck her off for cape horn again
1 the proport of the ingredi of the tea that wa made for us
and our as i have befor state wa a favor specimen of
american merchantmen were a pint of tea and a pint and a half of
molass to about three gallon of water
these ar all boil down togeth in the copper and befor serv
it out the mess is stir up with a stick so as to give each man hi
fair share of sweeten and tealeav the tea for the cabin is of

2 i do not wish these remark so far as thei relat to the save of
expens in the outfit to be appli to the owner of our ship for she
wa suppli with an abund of store of the best kind that ar
given to seamen though the dispens of them is necessarili left to
the captain inde so high wa the reput of the emploi among
men and offic for the charact and outfit of their vessel and
for their liber in conduct their voyag that when it wa
known that thei had a ship fit out for a long voyag and that
hand were to be ship at a certain timea half hour befor the

ic againa beauti afternooncap hornland hohead for
home
in our first attempt to doubl the cape when we came up to the
latitud of it we were nearli seventeen hundr mile to the westward
but in run for the strait of magellan we stood so far to the
eastward that we made our second attempt at a distanc of not more
than four or five hundr mile and we had great hope by thi mean
to run clear of the ic think that the easterli gale which had
prevail for a long time would have driven it to the westward with
the wind about two point free the yard brace in a littl and two
closereef topsail and a reef foresail on the ship we made great
wai toward the southward and almost everi watch when we came on deck
the air seem to grow colder and the sea to run higher still we
saw no ic and had great hope of go clear of it altogeth when
on afternoon about three oclock while we were take a siesta
dure our watch below all hand wa call in a loud and fear
voic tumbl up here mentumbl updont stop for your
clothesbefor were upon it we sprang out of our berth and
hurri upon deck
the loud sharp voic of the captain wa heard give order as though
for life or death and we ran aft to the brace not wait to look
ahead for not a moment wa to be lost the helm wa hard up the after
yard shake and the ship in the act of wear
slowli with stiff rope and ic rig we swung the yard round
everyth come hard and with a creak and rend sound like
pull up a plank which had been frozen into the ic the ship wore
round fairli the yard were steadi and we stood off on the other
tack leav behind us directli under our larboard quarter a larg
ic island peer out of the mist and reach high abov our top
while astern and on either side of the island larg tract of
fieldic were dimli seen heav and roll in the sea we were now
safe and stand to the northward but in a few minut more had it
not been for the sharp lookout of the watch we should have been
fairli upon the ic and left our ship old bone adrift in the
southern ocean after stand to the northward a few hour we wore
ship and the wind have haul we stood to the southward and
eastward all night long a bright lookout wa kept from everi part of
the deck and whenev ic wa seen on the on bow or the other the
helm wa shift and the yard brace and by quick work of the ship
she wa kept clear the accustom cry of ic aheadic on the
lee bowanoth island in the same tone and with the same
order follow them seem to bring us directli back to our old
posit of the week befor
dure our watch on deck which wa from twelv to four the wind came
out ahead with a pelt storm of hail and sleet and we lai hoveto
under a closereef main topsail the whole watch dure the next
watch it fell calm with a drench rain until daybreak when the
wind came out to the westward and the weather clear up and show
us the whole ocean in the cours which we should have steer had it
not been for the head wind and calm complet block up with ic
here then our progress wa stop and we wore ship and onc more
stood to the northward and eastward not for the strait of magellan
but to make anoth attempt to doubl the cape still farther to the
eastward for the captain wa determin to get round if persever
could do it and the third time he said never fail
with a fair wind we soon ran clear of the fieldic and by noon had
onli the strai island float far and near upon the ocean
the sun wa out bright the sea of a deep blue fring with the white
foam of the wave which ran high befor a strong southwest our
solitari ship tore on through the water as though glad to be out of
her confin and the ic island lai scatter upon the ocean here
and there of variou size and shape reflect the bright rai of
the sun and drift slowli northward befor the gale it wa a
contrast to much that we had late seen and a spectacl not onli of
beauti but of life for it requir but littl fanci to imagin these
island to be anim mass which had broken loos from the thrill
region of thickrib ic and were work their wai by wind and
current some alon and some in fleet to milder clime no pencil
ha ever yet given anyth like the true effect of an iceberg in a
pictur thei ar huge uncouth mass stuck in the sea while their
chief beauti and grandeurtheir slow state motion the whirl of
the snow about their summit and the fear groan and crack of
their partsth pictur cannot give thi is the larg iceberg
while the small and distant island float on the smooth sea in the
light of a clear dai look like littl float fairi isl of sapphir
from a northeast cours we gradual haul to the eastward and after
sail about two hundr mile which brought us as near to the
western coast of terra del fuego as wa safe and have lost sight of
the ic altogetherfor the third time we put the ship head to the
southward to try the passag of the cape the weather continu clear
and cold with a strong gale from the westward and we were fast
get up with the latitud of the cape with a prospect of soon be
round on fine afternoon a man who had gone into the foretop to
shift the roll tackl sung out at the top of hi voic and with
evid gleesail ho neither land nor sail had we seen sinc
leav san diego and ani on who ha travers the length of a whole
ocean alon can imagin what an excit such an announc
produc on board sail ho shout the cook jump out of hi
gallei sail ho shout a man throw back the slide of the
scuttl to the watch below who were soon out of their berth and on
deck and sail ho shout the captain down the companionwai to the
passeng in the cabin besid the pleasur of see a ship and
human be in so desol a place it wa import for us to speak a
vessel to learn whether there wa ic to the eastward and to
ascertain the longitud for we had no chronomet and had been
drift about so long that we had nearli lost our reckon and
opportun for lunar observ ar not frequent or sure in such a
place as cape horn for these variou reason the excit in our
littl commun wa run high and conjectur were made and
everyth thought of for which the captain would hail when the man
aloft sung outanoth sail larg on the weather bow
thi wa a littl odd but so much the better and did not shake our
faith in their be sail at length the man in the top hail and
said he believ it wa land after all land in your ey said the
mate who wa look through a telescop thei ar ic island if i
can see a hole through a ladder and a few moment show the mate to
be right and all our expect fled and instead of what we most
wish to see we had what we most dread and what we hope we had
seen the last of we soon howev left these astern have pass
within about two mile of them and at sundown the horizon wa clear in
all direct
have a fine wind we were soon up with and pass the latitud of the
cape and have stood far enough to the southward to give it a wide
berth we began to stand to the eastward with a good prospect of be
round and steer to the northward on the other side in a veri few
dai
but ill luck seem to have light upon us not four hour had we
been stand on in thi cours befor it fell dead calm and in half
an hour it cloud up a few straggl blast with spit of snow and
sleet came from the eastward and in an hour more we lai hoveto
under a closereef main topsail drift bodili off to leeward
befor the fiercest storm that we had yet felt blow dead ahead
from the eastward it seem as though the geniu of the place had
been rous at find that we had nearli slip through hi finger
and had come down upon us with tenfold furi the sailor said that
everi blast as it shook the shroud and whistl through the rig
said to the old ship no you dontno you dont
for eight dai we lai drift about in thi manner
sometimesgener toward noonit fell calm onc or twice a
round copper ball show itself for a few moment in the place where
the sun ought to have been and a puff or two came from the westward
give some hope that a fair wind had come at last dure the first
two dai we made sail for these puff shake the reef out of the
topsail and board the tack of the cours but find that it
onli made work for us when the gale set in again it wa soon given up
and we layto under our closereef
we had less snow and hail than when we were farther to the westward
but we had an abund of what is wors to a sailor in cold
weatherdrench rain snow is blind and veri bad when come
upon a coast but for genuin discomfort give me rain with freez
weather a snowstorm is excit and it doe not wet through the
cloth which is import to a sailor but a constant rain there is
no escap from it wet to the skin and make all protect vain
we had long ago run through all our dry cloth and as sailor have no
other wai of dry them than by the sun we had noth to do but to
put on those which were the least wet
at the end of each watch when we came below we took off our cloth
and wrung them out two take hold of a pair of trowserson at each
endand jacket in the same wai stock mitten and all were
wrung out also and then hung up to drain and chafe dry against the
bulkhead then feel of all our cloth we pick out those
which were the least wet and put them on so as to be readi for a
call and turnedin cover ourselv up with blanket and slept
until three knock on the scuttl and the dismal sound of all
starbowlin ahoi eight bell there below do you hear the new
drawl out from on deck and the sulki answer of ay ay from
below sent us up again
on deck all wa as dark as a pocket and either a dead calm with the
rain pour steadili down or more gener a violent gale dead
ahead with rain pelt horizont and occasion variat of
hail and sleetdeck afloat with water swash from side to side
and constantli wet feet for boot could not be wrung out like drawer
and no composit could stand the constant soak in fact wet and
cold feet ar inevit in such weather and ar not the least of
those littl item which go to make up the grand total of the
discomfort of a winter passag round the cape few word were spoken
between the watch as thei shift the wheel wa reliev the mate
took hi place on the quarterdeck the lookout in the bow and each
man had hi narrow space to walk fore and aft in or rather to swing
himself forward and back in from on belai pin to anotherfor the
deck were too slipperi with ic and water to allow of much walk
to make a walk which is absolut necessari to pass awai the time
on of us hit upon the expedi of sand the deck and afterward
whenev the rain wa not so violent as to wash it off the weathersid
of the quarterdeck and a part of the waist and forecastl were
sprinkl with the sand which we had on board for holyston and thu
we made a good promenad where we walk fore and aft two and two
hour after hour in our long dull and comfortless watch the bell
seem to be an hour or two apart instead of half an hour and an ag
to elaps befor the welcom sound of eight bell the sole object wa
to make the time pass on ani chang wa sought for which would break
the monotoni of the time and even the two hour trick at the wheel
which came round to each of us in turn onc in everi other watch wa
look upon as a relief even the neverfail resourc of long
yarn which ek out mani a watch seem to have fail us now for we
had been so long togeth that we had heard each other stori told
over and over again till we had them by heart each on knew the whole
histori of each of the other and we were fairli and liter talk
out sing and joke we were in no humor for and in fact ani
sound of mirth or laughter would have struck strang upon our ear
and would not have been toler ani more than whistl or a wind
instrument the last resort that of specul upon the futur
seem now to fail us for our discourag situat and the danger
we were realli in as we expect everi dai to find ourselv drift
back among the ic clap a stopper upon all that from
sayingwhen we get homew began insens to alter it toif we
get homeand at last the subject wa drop by a tacit consent
in thi state of thing a new light wa struck out and a new field
open by a chang in the watch on of our watch wa laid up for two
or three dai by a bad hand for in cold weather the least cut or
bruis ripen into a sore and hi place wa suppli by the
carpent thi wa a windfal and there wa quit a contest who
should have the carpent to walk with him as chip wa a man of
some littl educ and he and i had had a good deal of intercours
with each other he fell in with me in my walk he wa a fin but
spoke english veri well and gave me long account of hi countryth
custom the trade the town what littl he knew of the govern
i found he wa no friend of russia hi voyag hi first arriv in
america hi marriag and courtshiph had marri a countrywoman of
hi a dressmak whom he met with in boston i had veri littl to
tell him of my quiet sedentari life at home and in spite of our best
effort which had protract these yarn through five or six watch
we fairli talk on anoth out and i turn him over to anoth man
in the watch and put myself upon my own resourc
i commenc a deliber system of timekil which unit some
profit with a cheer up of the heavi hour as soon as i came on
deck and took my place and regular walk i began with repeat over
to myself a string of matter which i had in my memori in regular
order first the multipl tabl and the tabl of weight and
measur then the state of the union with their capit the
counti of england with their shire town the king of england in
their order and a larg part of the peerag which i commit from an
almanac that we had on board and then the kanaka numer thi
carri me through my fact and be repeat deliber with
long interv often ek out the two first bell then came the ten
command the thirtyninth chapter of job and a few other passag
from scriptur the next in the order that i never vari from came
cowper castawai which wa a great favorit with me the solemn
measur and gloomi charact of which as well as the incid that it
wa found upon made it well suit to a lone watch at sea then
hi line to mari hi address to the jackdaw and a short extract from
tabl talk i abound in cowper for i happen to have a volum of
hi poem in my chest ill et nefasto from horac and goeth erl
king after i had got through these i allow myself a more gener
rang among everyth that i could rememb both in prose and vers
in thi wai with an occasion break by reliev the wheel heav
the log and go to the scuttlebutt for a drink of water the
longest watch wa pass awai and i wa so regular in my silent
recit that if there wa no interrupt by ship duti i could
tell veri nearli the number of bell by my progress
our watch below were no more vari than the watch on deck
all wash sew and read wa given up and we did noth but
eat sleep and stand our watch lead what might be call a cape
horn life the forecastl wa too uncomfort to sit up in and
whenev we were below we were in our berth to prevent the rain
and the seawat which broke over the bow from wash down we were
oblig to keep the scuttl close so that the forecastl wa nearli
airtight in thi littl wet leaki hole we were all quarter in
an atmospher so bad that our lamp which swung in the middl from the
beam sometim actual burn blue with a larg circl of foul air
about it still i wa never in better health than after three week of
thi life i gain a great deal of flesh and we all at like hors
at everi watch when we came below befor turningin the bread barg
and beef kid were overhaul each man drank hi quart of hot tea
night and morn and glad enough we were to get it for no nectar and
ambrosia were sweeter to the lazi immort than wa a pot of hot tea
a hard biscuit and a slice of cold salt beef to us after a watch on
deck to be sure we were mere anim and had thi life last a year
instead of a month we should have been littl better than the rope in
the ship not a razor nor a brush nor a drop of water except the
rain and the sprai had come near us all the time for we were on an
allow of fresh water and who would strip and wash himself in salt
water on deck in the snow and ic with the thermomet at zero
after about eight dai of constant easterli gale the wind haul
occasion a littl to the southward and blew hard which as we
were well to the southward allow us to brace in a littl and stand
on under all the sail we could carri these turn last but a short
while and sooner or later it set again from the old quarter yet each
time we made someth and were gradual edg along to the
eastward on night after on of these shift of the wind and when
all hand had been up a great part of the time our watch wa left on
deck with the mainsail hang in the buntlin readi to be set if
necessari it came on to blow wors and wors with hail and snow
beat like so mani furi upon the ship it be as dark and thick
as night could make it the mainsail wa blow and slat with a
nois like thunder when the captain came on deck and order it to be
furl the mate wa about to call all hand when the captain stop
him and said that the men would be beaten out if thei were call up
so often that as our watch must stai on deck it might as well be
do that as anyth els
accordingli we went upon the yard and never shall i forget that piec
of work our watch had been so reduc by sick and by some have
been left in california that with on man at the wheel we had onli
the third mate and three besid myself to go aloft so that at most
we could onli attempt to furl on yardarm at a time we man the
weather yardarm and set to work to make a furl of it our lower
mast be short and our yard veri squar the sail had a head of
nearli fifti feet and a short leach made still shorter by the deep
reef which wa in it which brought the clew awai out on the quarter
of the yard and made a bunt nearli as squar as the mizen royalyard
besid thi difficulti the yard over which we lai wa case with ic
the gasket and rope of the foot and leach of the sail as stiff and
hard as a piec of suctionhos and the sail itself about as pliabl
as though it had been made of sheet of sheath copper it blew a
perfect hurrican with altern blast of snow hail and rain we
had to fist the sail with bare hand no on could trust himself to
mitten for if he slip he wa a gone man all the boat were
hoist in on deck and there wa noth to be lower for him we
had need of everi finger god had given us sever time we got the
sail upon the yard but it blew awai again befor we could secur it
it requir men to lie over the yard to pass each turn of the gasket
and when thei were pass it wa almost imposs to knot them so
that thei would hold frequent we were oblig to leav off
altogeth and take to beat our hand upon the sail to keep them
from freez
after some timewhich seem foreverw got the weather side stow
after a fashion and went over to leeward for anoth trial
thi wa still wors for the bodi of the sail had been blown over to
leeward and as the yard wa acockbil by the ly over of the
vessel we had to light it all up to windward when the yardarm were
furl the bunt wa all adrift again which made more work for us we
got all secur at last but we had been nearli an hour and a half upon
the yard and it seem an ag it just struck five bell when we went
up and eight were struck soon after we came down thi mai seem slow
work but consid the state of everyth and that we had onli
five men to a sail with just half as mani squar yard of canva in it
as the mainsail of the independ sixtygun ship which muster
seven hundr men at her quarter it is not wonder that we were no
quicker about it we were glad enough to get on deck and still more
to go below the oldest sailor in the watch said as he went downi
shall never forget that main yardit beat all my go a fish
fun is fun but furl on yardarm of a cours at a time off cape
horn is no better than mankil
dure the greater part of the next two dai the wind wa pretti
steadi from the southward we had evid made great progress and
had good hope of be soon up with the cape if we were not there
alreadi we could put but littl confid in our reckon as there
had been no opportun for an observ and we had drift too
much to allow of our dead reckon be anywher near the mark if
it would clear off enough to give a chanc for an observ or if we
could make land we should know where we were and upon these and the
chanc of fall in with a sail from the eastward we depend almost
entir
fridai juli 22d thi dai we had a steadi gale from the southward
and stood on under close sail with the yard eas a littl by the
weather brace the cloud lift a littl and show sign of
break awai in the afternoon i wa below with mr h the third
mate and two other fill the bread locker in the steerag from the
cask when a bright gleam of sunshin broke out and shone down the
companionwai and through the skylight light up everyth below
and send a warm glow through the heart of everi on it wa a sight
we had not seen for weeksan omen a godsend even the roughest and
hardest face acknowledg it influenc just at that moment we heard
a loud shout from all part of the deck and the mate call out down
the companionwai to the captain who wa sit in the cabin what
he said we could not distinguish but the captain kick over hi
chair and wa on deck at on jump we could not tell what it wa
and anxiou as we were to know the disciplin of the ship would not
allow of our leav our place yet as we were not call we knew
there wa no danger we hurri to get through with our job when
see the steward black face peer out of the pantri mr h
hail him to know what wa the matter lan o to be sure sir no
you hear em sing out lan o de capem sai im cape horn
thi gave us a new start and we were soon through our work and on
deck and there lai the land fair upon the larboard beam and slowli
edg awai upon the quarter all hand were busi look at itth
captain and mate from the quarterdeck the cook from hi gallei and
the sailor from the forecastl and even mr n the passeng who
had kept in hi shell for nearli a month and hardli been seen by
anybodi and who we had almost forgotten wa on board came out like a
butterfli and wa hop round as bright as a bird
the land wa the island of staten land and just to the eastward of
cape horn and a more desolatelook spot i never wish to set ey
uponbar broken and girt with rock and ic with here and there
between the rock and broken hillock a littl stunt veget of
shrub it wa a place well suit to stand at the junction of the two
ocean beyond the reach of human cultiv and encount the blast
and snow of a perpetu winter yet dismal as it wa it wa a
pleasant sight to us not onli as be the first land we had seen but
becaus it told us that we had pass the capewer in the
atlanticand that with twentyfour hour of thi breez might bid
defianc to the southern ocean it told us too our latitud and
longitud better than ani observ and the captain now knew where
we were as well as if we were off the end of long wharf
in the gener joi mr n said he should like to go ashor upon the
island and examin a spot which probabl no human be had ever set
foot upon but the captain intim that he would see the
islandspecimen and allinanoth place befor he would get out
a boat or delai the ship on moment for him
we left the land gradual astern and at sundown had the atlant
ocean clear befor us
chapter xxxiii
crack onprogress homewarda pleasant sundaya fine sightbyplai
it is usual in voyag round the cape from the pacif to keep to the
eastward of the falkland island but as it had now set in a strong
steadi and clear southwest with everi prospect of it last and
we had had enough of high latitud the captain determin to stand
immedi to the northward run insid the falkland island
accordingli when the wheel wa reliev at eight oclock the order
wa given to keep her due north and all hand were turn up to squar
awai the yard and make sail in a moment the new ran through the
ship that the captain wa keep her off with her nose straight for
boston and cape horn over her taffrail it wa a moment of
enthusiasm everi on wa on the alert and even the two sick men
turn out to lend a hand at the halyard the wind wa now due
southwest and blow a gale to which a vessel close haul could
have shown no more than a singl closereef sail but as we were
go befor it we could carri on
accordingli hand were sent aloft and a reef shaken out of the
topsail and the reef foresail set when we came to masthead the
topsail yard with all hand at the halyard we struck up cheerili
men with a choru which might have been heard halfwai to staten
land under her increas sail the ship drove on through the water
yet she could bear it well and the captain sang out from the
quarterdeckanoth reef out of that foretopsail and give it to
her two hand sprang aloft the frozen reefpoint and ear were
cast adrift the halyard man and the sail gave out her increas
canva to the gale all hand were kept on deck to watch the effect of
the chang it wa as much as she could well carri and with a heavi
sea astern it took two men at the wheel to steer her she flung the
foam from her bow the sprai break aft as far as the gangwai she
wa go at a prodigi rate
still everyth held prevent brace were reev and haul
taut tackl got upon the backstai and each thing done to keep all
snug and strong the captain walk the deck at a rapid stride look
aloft at the sail and then to windward the mate stood in the
gangwai rub hi hand and talk aloud to the shiphurrah old
bucket the boston girl have got hold of the towrop and the like
and we were on the forecastl look to see how the spar stood it
and guess the rate at which she wa goingwhen the captain call
outmr brown get up the topmast studdingsail what she cant
carri she mai drag the mate look a moment but he would let no on
be befor him in dare
he sprang forwardhurrah men rig out the topmast studdingsail
boom lai aloft and ill send the rig up to youw sprang
aloft into the top lower a girtlin down by which we haul up the
rig rove the tack and halyard ran out the boom and lash it
fast and sent down the lower halyard as a prevent it wa a clear
starlight night cold and blow but everybodi work with a will
some inde look as though thei thought the old man wa mad but
no on said a word we had had a new topmast studdingsail made with a
reef in ita thing hardli ever heard of and which the sailor had
ridicul a good deal sai that when it wa time to reef a
studdingsail it wa time to take it in but we found a us for it
now for there be a reef in the topsail the studdingsail could
not be set without on in it also to be sure a studdingsail with
reef topsail wa rather a new thing yet there wa some reason in
it for if we carri that awai we should lose onli a sail and a boom
but a whole topsail might have carri awai the mast and all
while we were aloft the sail had been got out bent to the yard
reef and readi for hoist wait for a good opportun the
halyard were man and the yard hoist fairli up to the block but
when the mate came to shake the catspaw out of the downhaul and we
began to boomend the sail it shook the ship to her centr the boom
buckl up and bent like a whipstick and we look everi moment to
see someth go but be of the short tough upland spruce it bent
like whalebon and noth could break it the carpent said it wa
the best stick he had ever seen the strength of all hand soon
brought the tack to the boomend and the sheet wa trim down and
the prevent and the weather brace haul taut to take off the
strain everi ropeyarn seem stretch to the utmost and everi
thread of canva and with thi sail ad to her the ship sprang
through the water like a thing possess the sail be nearli all
forward it lift her out of the water and she seem actual to
jump from sea to sea from the time her keel wa laid she had never
been so driven and had it been life or death with everi on of us she
could not have born anoth stitch of canva
find that she would bear the sail the hand were sent below and
our watch remain on deck two men at the wheel had as much as thei
could do to keep her within three point of her cours for she steer
as wild as a young colt the mate walk the deck look at the
sail and then over the side to see the foam fly by her slap hi
hand upon hi thigh and talk to the shiphurrah you jade
youv got the scentyou know where your go and when she
leap over the sea and almost out of the water and trembl to her
veri keel the spar and mast snap and creakingther she
goesther she goeshandsomelya long as she crack she
holdswhil we stood with the rig laid down fair for let go
and readi to take in sail and clear awai if anyth went at four
bell we hove the log and she wa go eleven knot fairli and had
it not been for the sea from aft which sent the ship home and threw
her continu off her cours the log would have shown her to have
been go much faster i went to the wheel with a young fellow from
the kennebec who wa a good helmsman and for two hour we had our
hand full a few minut show us that our monkeyjacket must come
off and cold as it wa we stood in our shirtsleev in a
perspir and were glad enough to have it eight bell and the
wheel reliev we turnedin and slept as well as we could though the
sea made a constant roar under her bow and wash over the forecastl
like a small cataract
at four oclock we were call again the same sail wa still on the
vessel and the gale if there wa ani chang had increas a littl
no attempt wa made to take the studdingsail in and inde it wa
too late now if we had start anyth toward take it in either
tack or halyard it would have blown to piec and carri someth
awai with it the onli wai now wa to let everyth stand and if the
gale went down well and good if not someth must goth weakest
stick or rope firstand then we could get it in for more than an
hour she wa driven on at such a rate that she seem actual to crowd
the sea into a heap befor her and the water pour over the spritsail
yard as it would over a dam toward daybreak the gale abat a littl
and she wa just begin to go more easili along reliev of the
pressur when mr brown determin to give her no respit and
depend upon the wind subsid as the sun rose told us to get
along the lower studdingsail thi wa an immens sail and held wind
enough to last a dutchman a weekhoveto it wa soon readi the
boom top up prevent gui rove and the idler call up to man
the halyard yet such wa still the forc of the gale that we were
nearli an hour set the sail carri awai the outhaul in do it
and came veri near snap off the swing boom no sooner wa it
set than the ship tore on again like on that wa mad and began to
steer as wild as a hawk the men at the wheel were puf and blow
at their work and the helm wa go hard up and hard down
constantli add to thi the gale did not lessen as the dai came on
but the sun rose in cloud a sudden lurch threw the man from the
weather wheel across the deck and against the side the mate sprang to
the wheel and the man regain hi feet seiz the spoke and thei
hove the wheel up just in time to save her from broach to though
nearli half the studdingsail went under water and as she came to the
boom stood up at an angl of forti five degre she had evid
more on her than she could bear yet it wa in vain to try to take it
inth clewlin wa not strong enough and thei were think of
cut awai when anoth wide yaw and a cometo snap the gui
and the swing boom came in with a crash against the lower rig
the outhaul block gave wai and the topmast studdingsail boom bent in
a manner which i never befor suppos a stick could bend i had my
ey on it when the gui part and it made on spring and buckl up
so as to form nearli a half circl and sprang out again to it shape
the clewlin gave wai at the first pull the cleat to which the
halyard were belai wa wrench off and the sail blew round the
spritsail yard and head gui which gave us a bad job to get it in
a half hour serv to clear all awai and she wa suffer to drive on
with her topmast studdingsail set it be as much as she could
stagger under
dure all thi dai and the next night we went on under the same sail
the gale blow with undiminish forc two men at the wheel all the
time watch and watch and noth to do but to steer and look out for
the ship and be blown alonguntil the noon of the next dai

began to melt from off the rig and spar and except a littl
which remain in the top and round the hound of the lower mast wa
soon gone as we left the gale behind us the reef were shaken out of
the topsail and sail made as fast as she could bear it and everi
time all hand were sent to the halyard a song wa call for and we
hoist awai with a will
sail after sail wa ad as we drew into fine weather and in on
week after leav cape horn the long topgal mast were got up

notwithstand all that ha been said about the beauti of a ship under
full sail there ar veri few who have ever seen a ship liter
under all her sail a ship come in or go out of port with her
ordinari sail and perhap two of three studdingsail is commonli
said to be under full sail but a ship never ha all her sail upon her
except when she ha a light steadi breez veri nearli but not quit
dead aft and so regular that it can be trust and is like to last
for some time then with all her sail light and heavi and
studdingsail on each side alow and aloft she is the most gloriou
move object in the world such a sight veri few even some who have
been at sea a great deal have ever beheld for from the deck of your
own vessel you cannot see her as you would a separ object
on night while we were in these tropic i went out to the end of the
flyingjibboom upon some duti and have finish it turn round
and lai over the boom for a long time admir the beauti of the sight
befor me be so far out from the deck i could look at the ship
as at a separ vesseland there rose up from the water support
onli by the small black hull a pyramid of canva spread out far
beyond the hull and tower up almost as it seem in the indistinct
night air to the cloud the sea wa as still as an inland lake the
light tradewind wa gentli and steadili breath from astern the
dark blue sky wa stud with the tropic star there wa no sound
but the rippl of the water under the stem and the sail were spread
out wide and highth two lower studdingsail stretch on each
side far beyond the deck the topmast studdingsail like wing to
the topsail the topgal studdingsail spread fearlessli out
abov them still higher the two royal studdingsail look like
two kite fly from the same string and highest of all the littl
skysail the apex of the pyramid seem actual to touch the star
and to be out of reach of human hand so quiet too wa the sea and
so steadi the breez that if these sail had been sculptur marbl
thei could not have been more motionless not a rippl upon the
surfac of the canva not even a quiver of the extrem edg of the
sailso perfectli were thei distend by the breez i wa so lost in
the sight that i forgot the presenc of the man who came out with me
until he said for he too rough old manofwarsman as he wa had
been gaze at the show half to himself still look at the marbl
sailshow quietli thei do their work
the fine weather brought work with it as the ship wa to be put in
order for come into port thi mai give a landsman some notion of
what is done on board shipal the first part of a passag is spent
in get a ship readi for sea and the last part in get her readi
for port she is as sailor sai like a ladi watch alwai out of
repair the new strong sail which we had up off cape horn were to
be sent down and the old set which were still servic in fine
weather to be bent in their place all the rig to be set up fore
and aft the mast stai the stand rig to be tar down
lower and topmast rig rattl down fore and aft the ship scrape
insid and out and paint deck varnish new and neat knot
seiz and cover to be fit and everi part put in order to
look well to the owner ey on come into boston thi of cours
wa a long matter and all hand were kept on deck at work for the
whole of each dai dure the rest of the voyag sailor call thi
hard usag but the ship must be in crack order and were homeward
bound wa the answer to everyth
we went on for sever dai emploi in thi wai noth remark
occur and at the latter part of the week fell in with the
southeast trade blow about eastsoutheast which brought them
nearli two point abaft our beam these blew strong and steadi so
that we hardli start a rope until we were beyond their latitud
the first dai of all hand on of those littl incid occur
which ar noth in themselv but ar great matter in the ey of a
ship compani as thei serv to break the monotoni of a voyag and
afford convers to the crew for dai afterward these small
matter too ar often interest as thei show the custom and state
of feel on shipboard
in merchant vessel the captain give hi order as to the ship
work to the mate in a gener wai and leav the execut of them
with the particular order to him thi ha becom so fix a
custom that it is like a law and is never infring upon by a wise
master unless hi mate is no seaman in which case the captain must
often overse thing for himself thi howev could not be said of
our chief mate and he wa veri jealou of ani encroach upon the
border of hi author
on mondai morn the captain told him to stai the foretopmast plumb
he accordingli came forward turn all hand to with tackl on the
stai and backstai come up with the seiz haul here
belai there and full of busi stand between the knighthead
to sight the mastwhen the captain came forward and also began to
give order thi made confus and the mate find that he wa
all aback left hi place and went aft sai to the captain
if you come forward sir ill go aft on is enough on the
forecastl
thi produc a repli and anoth fierc answer and the word flew
fist were doubl up and thing look threateningli
im master of thi ship
ye sir and im mate of her and know my place my place is
forward and your is aft
my place is where i choos i command the whole ship and you ar
mate onli so long as i choos
sai the word capt t and im done i can do a man work aboard
i didnt come through the cabin window if im not mate i can be
man etc etc
thi wa all fun for us who stood by wink at each other and
enjoi the contest between the higher power the captain took the
mate aft and thei had a long talk which end in the mate return
to hi duti the captain had broken through a custom which is a part
of the commonlaw of a ship and without reason for he knew that hi
mate wa a sailor and need no help from him and the mate wa
excus for be angri yet he wa wrong and the captain right
whatev the captain doe is right ipso facto and ani opposit to
it is wrong on board ship and everi offic and man know thi when
he sign the ship articl
it is a part of the contract yet there ha grown up in merchant
vessel a seri of custom which have becom a well understood
system and have almost the forc of prescript law to be sure all
power is in the captain and the offic hold their author onli
dure hi will and the men ar liabl to be call upon for ani
servic yet by break in upon these usag mani difficulti have
occur on board ship and even come into court of justic which ar
perfectli unintellig to ani on not acquaint with the univers
natur and forc of these custom mani a provoc ha been
offer and a system of petti oppress pursu toward men the
forc and mean of which would appear as noth to stranger and
doubtless do appear so to mani longshor juri and judg
the next littl divers wa a battl on the forecastl on
afternoon between the mate and the steward thei had been on bad
term the whole voyag and had threaten a ruptur sever time
thi afternoon the mate ask him for a tumbler of water and he
refus to get it for him sai that he wait upon nobodi but the
captain and here he had the custom on hi side but in answer he
left off the handl to the mate name thi enrag the mate who
call him a black soger and at it thei went clench strike
and roll over and over while we stood by look on and enjoi
the fun the darki tri to butt him but the mate got him down and
held him the steward sing out let me go mr brown or therel
be blood spilt in the midst of thi the captain came on deck
separ them took the steward aft and gave him half a dozen with a
rope end
the steward tri to justifi himself but he had been heard to talk of
spill blood and that wa enough to earn him hi flog and the
captain did not choos to inquir ani further

inevit have been thrown violent from the height of nineti or a
hundr feet overboard or what is wors upon the deck howev a
miss is as good as a mile a sai which sailor veri often have
occas to us an escap is alwai a joke on board ship a man
would be ridicul who should make a seriou matter of it a sailor
know too well that hi life hang upon a thread to wish to be alwai
remind of it so if a man ha an escap he keep it to himself or
make a joke of it i have often known a man life to be save by an

which swept the north atlant destroi almost everyth befor it
the first night after the tradewind left us while we were in the
latitud of the island of cuba we had a specimen of a true tropic
thunder storm a light breez had been blow directli from aft
dure the first part of the night which gradual di awai and
befor midnight it wa dead calm and a heavi black cloud had shroud
the whole sky when our watch came on deck at twelv oclock it wa
as black as erebu the studdingsail were all taken in and the
royal furl not a breath wa stir the sail hung heavi and
motionless from the yard and the perfect still and the dark
which wa almost palpabl were truli appal not a word wa
spoken but everi on stood as though wait for someth to happen
in a few minut the mate came forward and in a low tone which wa
almost a whisper told us to haul down the jib the fore and mizen
topgal sail were taken in in the same silent manner and we lai
motionless upon the water with an uneasi expect which from the
long suspens becam actual pain we could hear the captain
walk the deck but it wa too dark to see anyth more than on
hand befor the face soon the mate came forward again and gave an
order in a low tone to clew up the main topgal sail and so
infecti wa the aw and silenc that the clewlin and buntlin
were haul up without ani of the customari sing out at the rope
an english lad and myself went up to furl it and we had just got the
bunt up when the mate call out to us someth we did not hear
whatbut suppos it to be an order to bearahand we hurri and
made all fast and came down feel our wai among the rig when
we got down we found all hand look aloft and there directli over
where we had been stand upon the main topgallantmasthead wa a
ball of light which the sailor name a corpos corpu sancti and
which the mate had call out to us to look at thei were all watch
it carefulli for sailor have a notion that if the corpos rise in
the rig it is a sign of fair weather but if it come lower down
there will be a storm unfortun as an omen it came down and
show itself on the topgal yardarm we were off the yard in
good season for it is held a fatal sign to have the pale light of the
corpos thrown upon on face as it wa the english lad did not
feel comfort at have had it so near him and directli over hi
head in a few minut it disappear and show itself again on the
fore topgal yard and after plai about for some time
disappear again when the man on the forecastl point to it upon
the flyingjibboomend but our attent wa drawn from watch
thi by the fall of some drop of rain and by a percept
increas of the dark which seem suddenli to add a new shade of
black to the night in a few minut low grumbl thunder wa
heard and some random flash of lightn came from the southwest
everi sail wa taken in but the topsail still no squall appear to
be come a few puff lift the topsail but thei fell again to the
mast and all wa as still as ever a moment more and a terrif
flash and peal broke simultan upon us and a cloud appear to
open directli over our head and let down the water in on bodi like a
fall ocean we stood motionless and almost stupefi yet noth
had been struck peal after peal rattl over our head with a sound
which seem actual to stop the breath in the bodi and the speedi
gleam kept the whole ocean in a glare of light the violent fall of
rain last but a few minut and wa succeed by occasion drop
and shower but the lightn continu incess for sever hour
break the midnight dark with irregular and blind flash
dure all which time there wa not a breath stir and we lai
motionless like a mark to be shot at probabl the onli object on the
surfac of the ocean for mile and mile we stood hour after hour
until our watch wa out and we were reliev at four oclock dure
all thi time hardli a word wa spoken no bell were struck and the
wheel wa silent reliev the rain fell at interv in heavi
shower and we stood drench through and blind by the flash
which broke the egyptian dark with a bright which seem almost
malign while the thunder roll in peal the concuss of which
appear to shake the veri ocean a ship is not often injur by
lightn for the electr is separ by the great number of
point she present and the quantiti of iron which she ha scatter
in variou part the electr fluid ran over our anchor topsail
sheet and ti yet no harm wa done to us we went below at four
oclock leav thing in the same state it is not easi to sleep
when the veri next flash mai tear the ship in two or set her on fire
or where the deathlik calm mai be broken by the blast of a hurrican
take the mast out of the ship but a man is no sailor if he cannot
sleep when he turnsin and turn out when he call and when at
seven bell the customari all the larboard watch ahoi brought us
on deck it wa a fine clear sunni morn the ship go leisur

our captain had been marri onli a few week befor he left boston
and after an absenc of over two year it mai be suppos he wa not

and the second mate though he wa afraid to press sail wa afraid as
death of the captain and be between two fear sometim carri on

twentyfour hour as fast as thei could be fit and rig out
sprung the spritsail yard and made noth of studdingsail boom
besid the natur desir to get home we had anoth reason for urg
the ship on the scurvi had begun to show itself on board on man
had it so badli as to be disabl and off duti and the english lad
ben wa in a dread state and wa daili grow wors hi leg
swell and pain him so that he could not walk hi flesh lost it

shape and hi gum swell until he could not open hi mouth hi
breath too becam veri offens he lost all strength and spirit
could eat noth grew wors everi dai and in fact unless someth
wa done for him would be a dead man in a week at the rate at which
he wa sink the medicin were all or nearli all gone and if we
had had a chestful thei would have been of no us for noth but
fresh provis and terra firma ha ani effect upon the scurvi thi
diseas is not so common now as formerli and is attribut gener
to salt provis want of cleanli the free us of greas and fat
which is the reason of it preval among whalemen and last of
all to lazi it never could have been from the latter caus on
board our ship nor from the second for we were a veri cleanli crew
kept our forecastl in neat order and were more particular about
wash and chang cloth than mani betterdress peopl on shore
it wa probabl from have none but salt provis and possibl from
our have run veri rapidli into hot weather after have been so long
in the extremest cold
depend upon the westerli wind which prevail off the coast in the
autumn the captain stood well to the westward to run insid of the
bermuda and in the hope of fall in with some vessel bound to the
west indi or the southern state the scurvi had spread no farther
among the crew but there wa danger that it might and these case
were bad on

turn up to see the stranger as she drew nearer she prove to be an

probabl bound out from the northern state to the west indi and
wa just the thing we wish to see she hoveto for us see that we
wish to speak her and we ran down to her boomend our
studdingsail back our main topsail and hail herbrig

of them we lower awai the quarterboat instantli and the captain
and four hand sprang in and were soon danc over the water and
alongsid the brig in about half an hour thei return with half a
boatload of potato and onion and each vessel fill awai and kept
on her cours she prove to be the brig solon of plymouth from the
connecticut river and last from new york bound to the spanish main
with a cargo of fresh provis mule tin bakepan and other
notion the onion were genuin and fresh and the mate of the brig
told the men in the boat as he pass the bunch over the side that
the girl had strung them on purpos for us the dai he sail we had
suppos on board that a new presid had been chosen the last
winter and just as we fill awai the captain hail and ask who
wa presid of the unit state thei answer andrew jackson but
think that the old gener could not have been elect for a third
time we hail again and thei answeredjack down and left us to
correct the mistak at our leisur
it wa just dinnertim when we fill awai and the steward take a
few bunch of onion for the cabin gave the rest to us with a bottl
of vinegar we carri them forward stow them awai in the
forecastl refus to have them cook and at them raw with our
beef and bread and a gloriou treat thei were the fresh and
crisp of the raw onion with the earthi tast give it a great
relish to on who ha been a long time on salt provis
we were perfectli raven after them it wa like a scent of blood to
a hound we at them at everi meal by the dozen and fill our
pocket with them to eat in our watch on deck and the bunch rise
in the form of a cone from the largest at the bottom to the smallest
no larger than a strawberri at the top soon disappear
the chief us howev of the fresh provis wa for the men with
the scurvi on of them wa abl to eat and he soon brought himself
to by gnaw upon raw potato but the other by thi time wa
hardli abl to open hi mouth and the cook took the potato raw
pound them in a mortar and gave him the juic to drink thi he
swallow by the teaspoon at a time and rins it about hi gum
and throat the strong earthi tast and smell of thi extract of the
raw potato at first produc a shudder through hi whole frame and
after drink it an acut pain which ran through all part of hi
bodi but know by thi that it wa take strong hold he
persev drink a spoon everi hour or so and hold it a long
time in hi mouth until by the effect of thi drink and of hi own
restor hope for he had nearli given up in despair he becam so
well as to be abl to move about and open hi mouth enough to eat the
raw potato and onion pound into a soft pulp thi cours soon
restor hi appetit and strength and in ten dai after we spoke the
solon so rapid wa hi recoveri that from ly helpless and almost
hopeless in hi berth he wa at the masthead furl a royal
with a fine southwest wind we pass insid of the bermuda and
notwithstand the old couplet which wa quot again and again by
those who thought we should have on more touch of a storm befor our
voyag wa up
if the bermuda let you pass
you must bewar of hattera
we were to the northward of hattera with good weather and begin
to count not the dai but the hour to the time when we should be at
anchor in boston harbor
our ship wa in fine order all hand have been hard at work upon her
from daylight to dark everi dai but sundai from the time we got into
warm weather on thi side the cape
it is a common notion with landsmen that a ship is in her finest
condit when she leav port to enter upon her voyag and that she
come home after a long absenc
with overweath rib and rag sail lean rent and beggar by
the strumpet wind
but so far from that unless a ship meet with some accid or come
upon the coast in the dead of winter when work cannot be done upon the
rig she is in her finest order at the end of the voyag when she
sail from port her rig is gener slack the mast need
stai the deck and side ar black and dirti from take in cargo
rigger seiz and overhand knot in place of nice seamanlik work
and everyth to a sailor ey adrift
but on the passag home the fine weather between the tropic is spent
in put the ship into the neatest order no merchant vessel look
better than an indiaman or a cape horner after a long voyag and
mani captain and mate will stake their reput for seamanship upon
the appear of their ship when she haul into the dock all our
stand rig fore and aft wa set up and tar the mast
stai the lower and topmast rig rattl down or up as the
fashion now is and so care were our offic to keep the rattlin
taut and straight that we were oblig to go aloft upon the rope
and shearpol with which the rig wa swift in and these were
us as juri rattlin until we got close upon the coast after thi
the ship wa scrape insid and out deck mast boom and all a
stage be rig outsid upon which we scrape her down to the
waterlin pound the rust off the chain bolt and fasten
then take two dai of calm under the line we paint her on the
outsid give her open port in her streak and finish off the
nice work upon the stern where sat neptun in hi car hold hi
trident drawn by seahors and retouch the gild and color
of the cornucopia which ornament her billethead the insid wa
then paint from the skysail truck to the waterwaysth yard black
masthead and top white monkeyrail black white and yellow
bulwark green plankshear white waterwai lead color etc etc
the anchor and ringbolt and other iron work were blacken with
coaltar and the steward kept at work polish the brass of the
wheel bell capstan etc the cabin too wa scrape varnish and
paint and the forecastl scrape and scrub there be no need
of paint and varnish for jack quarter the deck were then scrape
and varnish and everyth useless thrown overboard among which the
empti tar barrel were set on fire and thrown overboard on a dark
night and left blaze astern light up the ocean for mile add
to all thi labor the neat work upon the riggingth knot
flemishey splice seiz cover point and graft
which show a ship in crack order the last prepar and which
look still more like come into port wa get the anchor over

thursdai septemb 15th thi morn the temperatur and peculiar
appear of the water the quantiti of gulfwe float about
and a bank of cloud ly directli befor us show that we were on
the border of the gulf stream thi remark current run
northeast nearli across the ocean is almost constantli shroud in
cloud and is the region of storm and heavi sea vessel often run
from a clear sky and light wind with all sail at onc into a heavi
sea and cloudi sky with doublereef topsail a sailor told me that
on a passag from gibraltar to boston hi vessel near the gulf
stream with a light breez clear sky and studdingsail out alow and
aloft while befor it wa a long line of heavi black cloud ly
like a bank upon the water and a vessel come out of it under
doublereef topsail and with royal yard sent down as thei drew
near thei began to take in sail after sail until thei were reduc to
the same condit and after twelv or fourteen hour of roll and
pitch in a heavi sea befor a smart gale thei ran out of the bank
on the other side and were in fine weather again and under their
royal and skysail as we drew into it the sky becam cloudi the
sea high and everyth had the appear of the go off or the
come on of a storm it wa blow no more than a stiff breez yet
the wind be northeast which is directli against the cours of the
current made an ugli chop sea which heav and pitch the
vessel about so that we were oblig to send down the royal yard and
to take in our light sail at noon the thermomet which had been
repeatedli lower into the water show the temperatur to be
seventi which wa consider abov that of the aira is alwai
the case in the centr of the stream a lad who had been at work at
the royal masthead came down upon the deck and took a turn round the
longboat and look veri pale said he wa so sick that he could
stai aloft no longer but wa asham to acknowledg it to the offic
he went up again but soon gave out and came down and lean over the
rail as sick as a ladi passeng
he had been to sea sever year and had he said never been sick
befor he wa made so by the irregular pitch motion of the
vessel increas by the height to which he had been abov the hull
which is like the fulcrum of the lever an old sailor who wa at work
on the topgal yard said he felt disagre all the time and
wa glad when hi job wa done to get down into the top or upon the
deck anoth hand wa sent to the royal masthead who staid nearli
an hour but gave up the work must be done and the mate sent me i
did veri well for some time but began at length to feel veri
unpleasantli though i had never been sick sinc the first two dai
from boston and had been in all sort of weather and situat
still i kept my place and did not come down until i had got through
my work which wa more than two hour the ship certainli never act
so badli befor she wa pitch and jerk about in all manner of
wai the sail seem to have no steadi power over her the
taper point of the mast made variou curv and angl against the
sky overhead and sometim in on sweep of an instant describ an
arc of more than fortyf degre bring up with a sudden jerk
which made it necessari to hold on with both hand and then sweep
off in anoth long irregular curv i wa not posit sick and
came down with a look of indiffer yet wa not unwil to get
upon the compar terra firma of the deck a few hour more carri
us through and when we saw the sun go down upon our larboard beam in
the direct of the contin of north america we had left the bank
of dark stormi cloud astern in the twilight

the lower lighthous and it be about slack water we made littl
progress a fire wa heard in the direct of hingham and the
pilot said there wa a review there
the hingham boi got wind of thi and said if the ship had been twelv
hour sooner he should have been down among the soldier and in the
booth and have a grand time as it wa we had littl prospect of
get in befor night about two oclock a breez sprang up ahead
from the westward and we began beat up against it a fullrig
brig wa beat in at the same time and we pass on anoth in our
tack sometim on and sometim the other work to windward as
the wind and tide favor or oppos it wa my trick at the wheel
from two till four and i stood my last helm make between nine
hundr and a thousand hour which i had spent at the helm of our two
vessel the tide begin to set against us we made slow work and
the afternoon wa nearli spent befor we got abreast of the inner
light in the meantim sever vessel were come down outward
bound among which a fine larg ship with yard squar fair wind
and fair tide pass us like a racehors the men run out upon
her yard to rig out the studdingsail boom toward sundown the wind
came off in flaw sometim blow veri stiff so that the pilot took
in the royal and then it di awai when in order to get us in
befor the tide becam too strong the royal were set again as thi
kept us run up and down the rig all the time on hand wa sent
aloft at each masthead to standbi to loos and furl the sail at
the moment of the order i took my place at the fore and loos and
furl the royal five time between rainsford island and the castl
at on tack we ran so near to rainsford island that look down from
the royal yard the island with it hospit build nice gravel
walk and green plat seem to lie directli under our yardarm so
close is the channel to some of these island that we ran the end of
our flyingjibboom over on of the outwork of the fortif on
georg island and had an opportun of see the advantag of
that point as a fortifi place for in work up the channel we
present a fair stem and stern for rake from the batteri three
or four time on gun might have knock us to piec
we had all set our heart upon get up to town befor night and
go ashor but the tide begin to run strong against us and the
wind what there wa of it be ahead we made but littl by
weatherbow the tide and the pilot gave order to cockbil the
anchor and overhaul the chain make two long stretch which
brought us into the road under the lee of the castl he clew up
the topsail and let go the anchor and for the first time sinc
leav san diegoon hundr and thirtyf daysour anchor wa
upon bottom in half an hour more we were ly snugli with all
sail furl safe in boston harbor our long voyag end the
wellknown scene about us the dome of the state hous fade in the
western sky the light of the citi start into sight as the
dark came on and at nine oclock the clangor of the bell ring
their accustom peal among which the boston boi tri to
distinguish the wellknown tone of the old south
we had just done furl the sail when a beauti littl
pleasureboat luf up into the wind under our quarter and the
junior partner of the firm to which our ship belong jump on board
i saw him from the mizen topsail yard and knew him well
he shook the captain by the hand and went down into the cabin and in
a few moment came up and inquir of the mate for me
the last time i had seen him i wa in the uniform of an undergradu
of harvard colleg and now to hi astonish there came down from
aloft a rough allei look fellow with duck trowser and red shirt
long hair and face burnt as black as an indian he shook me by the
hand congratul me upon my return and my appear of health and
strength and said my friend were all well i thank him for tell
me what i should not have dare to ask and if
the first bringer of unwelcom new
hath but a lose offic and hi tongu
sound ever after like a sullen bell
certainli i shall ever rememb thi man and hi word with pleasur
the captain went up to town in the boat with mr h and left us to
pass anoth night on board ship and to come up with the morn
tide under command of the pilot
so much did we feel ourselv to be alreadi at home in anticip
that our plain supper of hard bread and salt beef wa bare touch
and mani on board to whom thi wa the first voyag could scarc
sleep as for myself by on of those anomal chang of feel of
which we ar all the subject i found that i wa in a state of
indiffer for which i could by no mean account a year befor
while carri hide on the coast the assur that in a twelvemonth
we should see boston made me half wild but now that i wa actual
there and in sight of home the emot which i had so long
anticip feel i did not find and in their place wa a state of
veri nearli entir apathi someth of the same experi wa
relat to me by a sailor whose first voyag wa on of five year upon
the northwest coast he had left home a lad and after sever year
of veri hard and try experi found himself homeward bound and
such wa the excit of hi feel that dure the whole passag
he could talk and think of noth els but hi arriv and how and
when he should jump from the vessel and take hi wai directli home
yet when the vessel wa made fast to the wharf and the crew dismiss
he seem suddenli to lose all feel about the matter he told me
that he went below and chang hi dress took some water from the
scuttlebutt and wash himself leisur overhaul hi chest and
put hi cloth all in order took hi pipe from it place fill it
and sit down upon hi chest smoke it slowli for the last time
here he look round upon the forecastl in which he had spent so mani
year and be alon and hi shipmat scatter he began to feel
actual unhappi home becam almost a dream and it wa not until hi
brother who had heard of the ship arriv came down into the
forecastl and told him of thing at home and who were wait there
to see him that he could realiz where he wa and feel interest
enough to put him in motion toward that place for which he had long
and of which he had dream for year there is probabl so much of
excit in prolong expect that the quiet realiz of it
produc a momentari stagnat of feel as well as of effort it
wa a good deal so with me the activ of prepar the rapid
progress of the ship the first make land the come up the harbor

conclud chapter
i trust that thei who have follow me to the end of my narr will
not refus to carri their attent a littl farther to the conclud
remark which i here present to them
thi chapter is written after the laps of a consider time sinc
the end of my voyag and after a return to my former pursuit and in
it i design to offer those view of what mai be done for seamen and of
what is alreadi do which i have deduc from my experi and
from the attent which i have sinc gladli given to the subject
the romant interest which mani take in the sea and in those who live
upon it mai be of us in excit their attent to thi subject
though i cannot but feel sure that all who have follow me in my
narr must be convinc that the sailor ha no romanc in hi
everydai life to sustain him but that it is veri much the same plain
matteroffact drudgeri and hardship which would be experienc on
shore if i have not produc thi convict i have fail in
persuad other of what my own experi ha most fulli impress
upon myself
there is a witcheri in the sea it song and stori and in the mere
sight of a ship and the sailor dress especi to a young mind
which ha done more to man navi and fill merchantmen than all the
pressgang of europ i have known a young man with such a passion
for the sea that the veri creak of a block stir up hi
imagin so that he could hardli keep hi feet on dry ground and
mani ar the boi in everi seaport who ar drawn awai as by an
almost irresist attract from their work and school and hang
about the deck and yard of vessel with a fond which it is
plain will have it wai no sooner howev ha the young sailor
begun hi new life in earnest than all thi fine draperi fall off
and he learn that it is but work and hardship after all thi is the
true light in which a sailor life is to be view and if in our
book and anniversari speech we would leav out much that is said
about blue water blue jacket open heart see god hand
on the deep and so forth and take thi up like ani other practic
subject i am quit sure we should do full as much for those we wish to
benefit the question is what can be done for sailor as thei
aremen to be fed and cloth and lodg for whom law must be
made and execut and who ar to be instruct in us knowledg
and abov all to be brought under religi influenc and restraint
it is upon these topic that i wish to make a few observ
in the first place i have no fanci about equal on board ship it
is a thing out of the question and certainli in the present state of
mankind not to be desir i never knew a sailor who found fault with
the order and rank of the servic and if i expect to pass the rest
of my life befor the mast i would not wish to have the power of the
captain diminish an iota it is absolut necessari that there
should be on head and on voic to control everyth and be
respons for everyth there ar emerg which requir the
instant exercis of extrem power these emerg do not allow of
consult and thei who would be the captain constitut advis
might be the veri men over whom he would be call upon to exert hi
author it ha been found necessari to vest in everi govern
even the most democrat some extraordinari and at first sight
alarm power trust in public opinion and subsequ
account to modifi the exercis of them these ar provid to
meet exig which all hope mai never occur but which yet by
possibl mai occur and if thei should and there were no power to
meet them instantli there would be an end put to the govern at
onc so it is with the author of the shipmast it will not
answer to sai that he shall never do thi and that thing becaus it
doe not seem alwai necessari and advis that it should be done
he ha great care and respons is answer for everyth
and is subject to emerg which perhap no other man exercis
author among civil peopl is subject to let him then have
power commensur with hi utmost possibl need onli let him be held
strictli respons for the exercis of them ani other cours would
be injustic as well as bad polici
in the treatment of those under hi author the captain is amen
to the common law like ani other person he is liabl at common law
for murder assault and batteri and other offenc and in addit to
thi there is a special statut of the unit state which make a
captain or other offic liabl to imprison for a term not
exceed five year and to a fine not exceed a thousand dollar
for inflict ani cruel punish upon withhold food from or in
ani other wai maltreat a seaman thi is the state of the law on
the subject while the relat in which the parti stand and the
peculiar necess excus and provoc aris from that
relat ar mere circumst to be consid in each case as
to the restraint upon the master exercis of power the law
themselv seem on the whole to be suffici i do not see that we
ar in need at present of more legisl on the subject the
difficulti li rather in the administr of the law and thi is
certainli a matter that deserv great consider and on of no
littl embarrass
in the first place the court have said that public polici requir
the power of the master and offic should be sustain mani live
and a great amount of properti ar constantli in their hand for which
thei ar strictli respons to preserv these and to deal justli
by the captain and not lai upon him a realli fear respons
and then tie up hi hand it is essenti that disciplin should be
support in the second place there is alwai great allow to be
made for fals swear and exagger by seamen and for
combin among them against their offic and it is to be
rememb that the latter have often no on to testifi on their side
these ar weighti and true statement and should not be lost sight of
by the friend of seamen on the other hand sailor make mani
complaint some of which ar well found
on the subject of testimoni seamen labor under a difficulti full as
great as that of the captain it is a wellknown fact that thei ar
usual much better treat when there ar passeng on board
the presenc of passeng is a restraint upon the captain not onli
from hi regard to their feel and to the estim in which thei
mai hold him but becaus he know thei will be influenti wit
against him if he is brought to trial though offic mai sometim be
inclin to show themselv off befor passeng by freak of offic
and author yet cruelti thei would hardli dare to be guilti of it
is on long and distant voyag where there is no restraint upon the
captain and none but the crew to testifi against him that sailor
need most the protect of the law on such voyag as these there
ar mani case of outrag cruelti on record enough to make on
heartsick and almost disgust with the sight of man and mani mani
more which have never come to light and never will be known until
the sea shall give up it dead mani of these have led to mutini and
piracystrip for stripe and blood for blood if on voyag of thi
descript the testimoni of seamen is not to be receiv in favor of
on anoth or too great a deduct is made on account of their be
seamen their case is without remedi and the captain know thi
will be strengthen in that disposit to tyrann which the
possess of absolut power without the restraint of friend and
public opinion is too apt to engend
it is to be consid also that the sailor come into court under
veri differ circumst from the master he is thrown among
landlord and shark of all descript is often led to drink
freeli and come upon the stand unaid and under a certain cloud of
suspicion as to hi charact and verac the captain on the other
hand is back by the owner and insur and ha an air of greater
respect though after all he mai have but a littl better
educ than the sailor and sometim especi among those
engag in certain voyag that i could mention a veri hacknei
conscienc
these ar the consider most commonli brought up on the subject of
seamen evid and i think it cannot but be obviou to everi on
that here posit legisl would be of no manner of us there
can be no rule of law regul the weight to be given to seamen
evid it must rest in the mind of the judg and juri and no
enact or posit rule of court could vari the result a hair in
ani on case the effect of a sailor testimoni in decid a case
must depend altogeth upon the reput of the class to which he
belong and upon the impress he himself produc in court by hi
deport and by those infal mark of charact which alwai
tell upon a juri
in fine after all the wellmeant and speciou project that have been
brought forward we seem driven back to the belief that the best mean
of secur a fair administr of the law made for the protect
of seamen and certainli the onli mean which can creat ani import
chang for the better is the gradual on of rais the intellectu
and religi charact of the sailor so that as an individu and as
on of a class he mai in the first instanc command the respect of
hi offic and if ani difficulti should happen mai upon the stand
carri that weight which an intellig and respect man of the lower
class almost alwai doe with a juri i know there ar mani men who
when a few case of great hardship occur and it is evid that there
is an evil somewher think that some arrang must be made some
law pass or some societi got up to set all right at onc on thi
subject there can be no call for ani such movement on the contrari i
fulli believ that ani public and strong action would do harm and that
we must be satisfi to labor in the less easi and less excit task
of gradual improv and abid the issu of thing work slowli
togeth for good
equal injudici would be ani interfer with the economi of the
ship the lodg food hour of sleep etc ar all matter which
though capabl of mani chang for the better must yet be left to
regul themselv and i am confid that there will be and that
there is now a gradual improv in all such particular the
forecastl of most of our ship ar small black and wet hole which
few landsmen would believ held a crew of ten or twelv men on a voyag
of month or year and often inde in most case the provis ar
not good enough to make a meal anyth more than a necessari part of a
dai duty1 and on the score of sleep i fulli believ that the
live of merchant seamen ar shorten by the want of it i do not
refer to those occas when it is necessarili broken in upon but
for month dure fine weather in mani merchantmen all hand ar
kept throughout the dai and then there ar eight hour on deck for
on watch each night thu it is usual the case that at the end of a
voyag where there ha been the finest weather and no disast the
crew have a weari and wornout appear thei never sleep longer
than four hour at a time and ar seldom call without be realli
in need of more rest there is no on thing that a sailor think more
of as a luxuri of life on shore than a whole night sleep still
all these thing must be left to be gradual modifi by circumst
whenev hard case occur thei should be made known and master and
owner should be held answer and will no doubt in time be
influenc in their arrang and disciplin by the increas
consider in which sailor ar held by the public
it is perfectli proper that the men should live in a differ part of
the vessel from the offic and if the forecastl is made larg and
comfort there is no reason why the crew should not live there as
well as in ani other part in fact sailor prefer the forecastl it
is their accustom place and in it thei ar out of the sight and
hear of their offic
as to their food and sleep there ar law with heavi penalti
requir a certain amount of store to be on board and safe stow
and for depriv the crew unnecessarili of food or sleep the captain
is liabl at common law as well as under the statut befor refer
to farther than thi it would not be safe to go
the captain must be the judg when it is necessari to keep hi crew
from their sleep and sometim a retrench not of the necessari
but of some of the littl niceti of their meal as for instanc
duff on sundai mai be a mode of punish though i think gener
an injudici on
i could not do justic to thi subject without notic on part of the
disciplin of a ship which ha been veri much discuss of late and
ha brought out strong express of indign from manyi mean
the inflict of corpor punish those who have follow me in
my narr will rememb that i wa wit to an act of great
cruelti inflict upon my own shipmat and inde i can sincer sai
that the simpl mention of the word flog bring up in me feel
which i can hardli control yet when the proposit is made to
abolish it entir and at onc to prohibit the captain from ever
under ani circumst inflict corpor punish i am oblig
to paus and i must sai to doubt exceedingli the expedi of
make ani posit enact which shall have that effect if the
design of those who ar write on thi subject is mere to draw
public attent to it and to discourag the practic of flog and
bring it into disreput it is well and inde whatev mai be the
end thei have in view the mere agit of the question will have
that effect and so far must do good yet i should not wish to take
the command of a ship tomorrow run my chanc of a crew as most
master must and know and have my crew know that i could not under
ani circumst inflict even moder chastis i should trust
that i might never have to resort to it and inde i scarc know
what risk i would not run and to what inconveni i would not
subject myself rather than do so yet not to have the power of
hold it up in terrorem and inde of protect myself and all
under my charg by it if some extrem case should aris would be a
situat i should not wish to be place in myself or to take the
respons of place anoth in
inde the difficulti into which master and offic ar liabl to
be thrown ar not suffici consid by mani whose sympathi ar
easili excit by stori frequent enough and true enough of
outrag abus of thi power it is to be rememb that more than
threefourth of the seamen in our merchant vessel ar foreign
thei ar from all part of the world a great mani from the north of
europ besid frenchmen spaniard portugues italian men from all
part of the mediterranean togeth with lascar negro and
perhap worst of all the offcast of british menofwar and men from
our own countri who have gone to sea becaus thei could not be
permit to live on land
as thing now ar mani master ar oblig to sail without know
anyth of their crew until thei get out at sea there mai be
pirat or mutin among them and on bad man will often infect all
the rest and it is almost certain that some of them will be ignor
foreign hardli understand a word of our languag accustom all
their live to no influenc but forc and perhap nearli as familiar
with the us of the knife as with that of the marlinespik no
prudent master howev peaceabl inclin would go to sea without hi
pistol and handcuff even with such a crew as i have suppos
kind and moder would be the best polici and the duti of everi
conscienti man and the administ of corpor punish might
be danger and of doubt us but the question is not what a
captain ought gener to do but whether it shall be put out of the
power of everi captain under ani circumst to make us of even
moder chastis as the law now stand a parent mai correct
moder hi child and the master hi apprentic and the case of
the shipmast ha been place upon the same principl the statut
and the common law as expound in the decis of court and in the
book of comment ar express and unanim to thi point that
the captain mai inflict moder corpor chastis for a
reason caus if the punish is excess or the caus not
suffici to justifi it he is answer and the juri ar to
determin by their verdict in each case whether under all the
circumst the punish wa moder and for a justifi caus
thi seem to me to be as good a posit as the whole subject can be
left in i mean to sai that no posit enact go beyond thi
is need or would be a benefit either to master or men in the
present state of thing thi again would seem to be a case which
should be left to the gradual work of it own cure as seamen
improv punish will becom less necessari and as the charact of
offic is rais thei will be less readi to inflict it and still
more the inflict of it upon intellig and respect men will
be an enorm which will not be toler by public opinion and by
juri who ar the puls of the bodi polit no on can have a
greater abhorr of the inflict of such punish than i have
and a stronger convict that sever is bad polici with a crew yet
i would ask everi reason man whether he had not better trust to the
practic becom unnecessari and disreput to the measur of
moder chastis and a justifi caus be better understood
and thu the act becom danger and in cours of time to be
regard as an unheardof barbaritythan to take the respons of
prohibit it at onc in all case and in what ever degre by
posit enact
there is howev on point connect with the administr of
justic to seamen to which i wish serious to call the attent of
those interest in their behalf and if possibl also of some of
those concern in that administr thi is the practic which
prevail of make strong appeal to the juri in mitig of damag
or to the judg after a verdict ha been render against a captain or
offic for a lenient sentenc on the ground of their previou good
charact and of their be poor and have friend and famili
depend upon them for support these appeal have been allow a
weight which is almost incred and which i think work a greater
hardship upon seamen than ani on other thing in the law or the
execut of them notwithstand everi advantag the captain ha
over the seaman in point of evid friend monei and abl counsel
it becom appar that he must fail in hi defenc an appeal is
then made to the juri if it is a civil action or to the judg for a
mitig sentenc if it is a crimin prosecut on the two ground
i have mention the same form is usual gone through in everi case
in the first place as to the previou good charact of the parti
wit ar brought from the town in which he resid to testifi to
hi good charact and to hi unexception conduct when on shore
thei sai that he is a good father or husband or son or neighbor and
that thei never saw in him ani sign of a cruel or tyrann
disposit i have even known evid admit to show the charact
he bore when a boi at school the owner of the vessel and other
merchant and perhap the presid of the insur compani ar then
introduc and thei testifi to hi correct deport express their
confid in hi honesti and sai that thei have never seen anyth
in hi conduct to justifi a suspicion of hi be capabl of cruelti
or tyranni thi evid is then put togeth and great stress is
laid upon the extrem respect of those who give it thei ar
the companion and neighbor of the captain it is saidmen who know
him in hi busi and domest relat and who knew him in hi
earli youth thei ar also men of the highest stand in the
commun and who as the captain employ must be suppos to
know hi charact thi testimoni is then contrast with that of
some half dozen obscur sailor who the counsel will not forget to
add ar exasper against the captain becaus he ha found it
necessari to punish them moder and who have combin against him
and if thei have not fabric a stori entir have at least so
exagger it that littl confid can be place in it
the next thing to be done is to show to the court and juri that the
captain is a poor man and ha a wife and famili or other friend
depend upon him for support that if he is fine it will onli be
take bread from the mouth of the innoc and helpless and lai a
burden upon them which their whole live will not be abl to work off
and that if he is imprison the confin to be sure he will have
to bear but the distress consequ upon the cut him off from hi
labor and mean of earn hi wage will fall upon a poor wife and
helpless children or upon an infirm parent these two topic well
put and urg home earnestli seldom fail of their effect
in deprec of thi mode of proceed and in behalf of men who i
believ ar everi dai wrong by it i would urg a few consider
which seem to me to be conclus
first as to the evid of the good charact the captain sustain on
shore it is to be rememb that master of vessel have usual
been brought up in a forecastl and upon all men and especi upon
those taken from lower situat the confer of absolut power is
too apt to work a great chang there ar mani captain whom i know to
be cruel and tyrann men at sea who yet among their friend and
in their famili have never lost the reput thei bore in
childhood in fact the seacaptain is seldom at home and when he is
hi stai is short and dure the continu of it he is surround by
friend who treat him with kind and consider and he ha
everyth to pleas and at the same time to restrain him he would
be a brute inde if after an absenc of month or year dure hi
short stai so short that the novelti and excit of it ha hardli
time to wear off and the attent he receiv as a visitor and
stranger hardli time to slackenif under such circumst a
townsman or neighbor would be justifi in testifi against hi
correct and peaceabl deport with the owner of the vessel also
to which he is attach and among merchant and insur gener he
is a veri differ man from what he mai be at sea when hi own
master and the master of everybodi and everyth about him he know
that upon such men and their good opinion of him he depend for hi
bread so far from their testimoni be of ani valu in determin
what hi conduct would be at sea on would expect that the master who
would abus and impos upon a man under hi power would be the most
compliant and deferenti to hi employ at home
as to the appeal made in the captain behalf on the ground of hi
be poor and have person depend upon hi labor for support the
main and fatal object to it is that it will cover everi case of the
kind and exempt nearli the whole bodi of master and offic from the
punish the law ha provid for them there ar veri few if ani
master or other offic of merchantmen in our countri who ar not
poor men and have either parent wive children or other
rel depend mainli or wholli upon their exert for support
in life few other follow the sea for subsist now if thi
appeal is to have weight with court in diminish the penalti the law
would otherwis inflict is not the whole class under a privileg which
will in a degre protect it in wrongdo it is not a thing that
happen now and then it is the invari appeal the last resort of
counsel when everyth els ha fail i have known case of the
most flagrant natur where after everi effort ha been made for the
captain and yet a verdict render against him and all other hope
fail thi appeal ha been urg and with such success that the
punish ha been reduc to someth littl more than nomin the
court not seem to consid that it might be made in almost everi
such case that could come befor them it is a littl singular too
that it seem to be confin to case of shipmast and offic no
on ever heard of a sentenc for an offenc commit on shore be
reduc by the court on the ground of the prison poverti and the
relat in which he mai stand to third person on the contrari it
had been thought that the certainti that disgrac and suffer will be
brought upon other as well as himself is on of the chief restraint
upon the crimin dispos besid thi cours work a peculiar
hardship in the case of the sailor for if poverti is the point in
question the sailor is the poorer of the two and if there is a man on
earth who depend upon whole limb and an unbroken spirit for support
it is the sailor he too ha friend to whom hi hard earn mai
be a relief and whose heart will bleed at ani cruelti or indign
practis upon him yet i never knew thi side of the case to be onc
advert to in these argument address to the lenienc of the court
which ar now so much in vogu and certainli thei ar never allow a
moment consider when a sailor is on trial for revolt or for an
injuri done to an offic notwithstand the mani difficulti which
lie in a seaman wai in a court of justic presum that thei will
be modifi in time there would be littl to complain of were it not
for these two appeal
it is no caus of complaint that the testimoni of seamen against their
offic is view with suspicion and that great allow is made for
combin and exagger on the contrari it is the judg duti
to charg the juri on these point strongli but there is reason for
object when after a strict crossexamin of wit after
the argument of counsel and the judg charg a verdict is found
against the master that the court should allow the practic of hear
appeal to it leniti support sole by evid of the captain
good conduct when on shore especi where the case is on in which
no evid but that of sailor could have been brought against the
accus and then on thi ground and on the invari claim of the
wife and famili be induc to cut down essenti the penalti impos
by a statut made expressli for master and offic of merchantmen
and for no on els
there ar mani particular connect with the man of vessel the
provis given to crew and the treatment of them while at sea upon
which there might be a good deal said but as i have for the most
part remark upon them as thei came up in the cours of my narr
i will offer noth further now except on the singl point of the
manner of ship men thi it is well known is usual left
entir to the shippingmast and is a caus of a great deal of
difficulti which might be remedi by the captain or owner if he ha
ani knowledg of seamen attend to it person on of the
member of the firm to which our ship belong mr s had been
himself a master of a vessel and gener select the crew from a
number sent down to him from the shippingoffic in thi wai he
almost alwai had healthi servic and respect men for ani
on who ha seen much of sailor can tell pretti well at first sight
by a man dress counten and deport what he would be on
board ship thi same gentleman wa also in the habit of see the
crew togeth and speak to them previous to their sail on
the dai befor our ship sail while the crew were get their
chest and cloth on board he went down into the forecastl and spoke
to them about the voyag the cloth thei would need the provis
he had made for them and saw that thei had a lamp and a few other
conveni if owner or master would more gener take the same
pain thei would often save their crew a good deal of inconveni
besid creat a sens of satisfact and gratitud which make a
voyag begin under good auspic and goe far toward keep up a
better state of feel throughout it continu
it onli remain for me now to speak of the associ public effort
which have been make of late year for the good of seamen a far more
agreeabl task than that of find fault even where fault there is
the exert of the gener associ call the american seamen
friend societi and of the other smaller societi throughout the
union have been a true bless to the seaman and bid fair in cours
of time to chang the whole natur of the circumst in which he is
place and give him a new name as well as a new charact these
associ have taken hold in the right wai and aim both at make
the sailor life more comfort and credit and at give him
spiritu instruct connect with these effort the spread of
temper among seamen by mean of societi call in their own
nautic languag windwardanchor societi and the distribut of
book the establish of sailor home where thei can be
comfort and cheapli board live quietli and decent and be in
the wai of religi servic read and convers also the
institut of save bank for seamen the distribut of tract and
biblesar all mean which ar silent do a great work for thi
class of men these societi make the religi instruct of seamen
their promin object if thi is gain there is no fear but that
all other thing necessari will be ad unto them a sailor never
becom interest in religion without immedi learn to read
if he did not know how befor and regular habit forehanded if i
mai us the word in worldli affair and hour reclaim from
indol and vice which follow in the wake of the convert man make
it sure that he will instruct himself in the knowledg necessari and
suitabl to hi call the religi chang is the great object if
thi is secur there is no fear but that knowledg of thing of the
world will come in fast enough with the sailor as with all other men
in fact the cultiv of the intellect and the spread of what is
commonli call us knowledg while religi instruct is
neglect is littl els than chang an ignor sinner into an
intellig and power on that sailor upon whom of all other
the preach of the cross is least like to have effect is the on
whose understand ha been cultiv while hi heart ha been left
to it own devic i fulli believ that those effort which have
their end in the intellectu cultiv of the sailor in give him
scientif knowledg put it in hi power to read everyth
without secur first of all a right heart which shall guid him in
judgment in give him polit inform and interest him in
newspapersan end in the further of which he is exhibit at
ladi fair and public meet and compliment for hi gallantri
and generosityar all do a harm which the labor of mani faith
men cannot undo
the establish of bethel in most of our own seaport and in mani
foreign port frequent by our vessel where the gospel is regularli
preach and the open of sailor home which i have befor
mention where there ar usual religi servic and other good
influenc ar do a vast deal in thi caus but it is to be
rememb that the sailor home is on the deep nearli all hi life
must be spent on board ship and to secur a religi influenc there
should be the great object the distribut of bibl and tract into
cabin and forecastl will do much toward thi there is noth
which will gain a sailor attent sooner and interest him more
deepli than a tract especi on which contain a stori it is
difficult to engag their attent in mere essai and argument but
the simplest and shortest stori in which home is spoken of kind
friend a prai mother or sister a sudden death and the like
often touch the heart of the roughest and most abandon the bibl
is to the sailor a sacr book it mai lie in the bottom of hi chest
voyag after voyag but he never treat it with posit disrespect
i never knew but on sailor who doubt it be the inspir word of
god and he wa on who had receiv an uncommonli good educ
except that he had been brought up without ani earli religi
influenc the most abandon man of our crew on sundai morn
ask on of the boi to lend him hi bibl the boi said he would
but wa afraid he would make sport of it no said the man i dont
make sport of god almighti thi is a feel gener among sailor
and is a good foundat for religi influenc
a still greater gain is made whenev by mean of a captain who is
interest in the etern welfar of those under hi command there can
be secur the perform of regular religi exercis and the
exert on the side of religion of that mighti influenc which a
captain possess for good or for evil there ar occurr at sea
which he mai turn to great accounta sudden death the apprehens
of danger or the escap from it and the like and all the call for
gratitud and faith besid thi state of thing alter the whole
current of feel between the crew and their command hi author
assum more of the parent charact and kinder feel exist
godwin though an infidel in on of hi novel describ the
relat in which a tutor stood to hi pupil sai that the convict
the tutor wa under that he and hi ward were both alik await a
state of etern happi or miseri and that thei must appear
togeth befor the same judgmentseat oper so upon hi natur
moros disposit as to produc a feel of kind and tender
toward hi ward which noth els could have caus such must be
the effect upon the relat of master and common seaman
there ar now mani vessel sail under such auspic in which great
good is done yet i never happen to fall in with on of them i did
not hear a prayer made a chapter read in public nor see anyth
approach to a religi servic for two year and a quarter there
were in the cours of the voyag mani incid which made for the
time seriou impress upon our mind and which might have been
turn to our good but there be no on to us the opportun and
no servic the regular return of which might have kept someth of
the feel aliv in us the advantag of them wa lost to some
perhap forev
the good which a singl religi captain mai do can hardli be
calcul in the first place as i have said a kinder state of
feel exist on board the ship there is no profan allow and
the men ar not call by ani opprobri name which is a great thing
with sailor the sabbath is observ thi give the men a dai of
rest even if thei pass it in no other wai such a captain too will
not allow a sailor on board hi ship to remain unabl to read hi bibl
and the book given to him and will usual instruct those who need
it in write arithmet and navig sinc he ha a good deal of
time on hi hand which he can easili emploi in such a manner he
will also have regular religi servic and in fact by the power
of hi exampl and where it can judici be done by the exercis
of hi author will give a charact to the ship and all on board
in foreign port a ship is known by her captain for there be no
gener rule in the merchant servic each master mai adopt a plan of
hi own it is to be rememb too that there ar in most ship
boi of a tender ag whose charact for life ar form as well as
old men whose live must be draw toward a close the greater part
of sailor die at sea and when thei find their end approach if it
doe not as is often the case come without warn thei cannot as
on shore send for a clergyman or some religi friend to speak to
them of that hope in a saviour which thei have neglect if not
despis through life but if the littl hull doe not contain such an
on within it compass thei must be left without human aid in their
great extrem when such command and such ship as i have just
describ shall becom more numer the hope of the friend of
seamen will be greatli strengthen and it is encourag to rememb
that the effort among common sailor will soon rais up such a class
for those of them who ar brought under these influenc will
inevit be the on to succe to the place of trust and author
if there is on earth an instanc where a littl leaven mai leaven the
whole lump it is that of the religi shipmast
it is to the progress of thi work among seamen that we must look with
the greatest confid for the remedi of those numer minor evil
and abus that we so often hear of it will rais the charact of
sailor both as individu and as a class it will give weight to
their testimoni in court of justic secur better usag to them on
board ship and add comfort to their live on shore and at sea there
ar some law that can be pass to remov temptat from their wai
and to help them in their progress and some chang in the
jurisdict of the lower court to prevent delai mai and probabl
will be made but gener speak more especi in thing which
concern the disciplin of ship we had better labor in thi great
work and view with caution the propos of new law and arbitrari
regul rememb that most of those concern in the make of
them must necessarili be littl qualifi to judg of their oper
without ani formal dedic of my narr to that bodi of men of
whose common life it is intend to be a pictur i have yet born them
constantli in mind dure it prepar i cannot but trust that
those of them into whose hand it mai chanc to fall will find in it
that which shall render ani profess of sympathi and good wish on
my part unnecessari and i will take the liberti on part with my
reader who ha gone down with us to the ocean and laid hi hand upon
it mane to commend to hi kind wish and to the benefit of hi
effort that class of men with whom for a time my lot wa cast i
wish the rather to do thi sinc i feel that whatev attent thi
book mai gain and whatev favor it mai find i shall ow almost
entir to that interest in the sea and those who follow it which is
so easili excit in us all
1 i am not sure that i have state in the cours of my narr
the manner in which sailor eat on board ship there ar neither
tabl knive fork nor plate in a forecastl but the kid a
wooden tub with iron hoop is place on the floor and the crew sit
round it and each man cut for himself with the common jackknif or
sheathknif that he carri about him thei drink their tea out of
tin pot hold littl less than a quart each
these particular ar not look upon as hardship and inde mai be
consid matter of choic sailor in our merchantmen furnish
their own eat utensil as thei do mani of the instrument which
thei us in the ship work such as knive palm and needl
marlinespik rubber etc and consid their mode of life in
other respect the littl time thei would have for lai and clear
awai a tabl with it apparatu and the room it would take up in a
forecastl as well as the simpl charact of their meal consist
gener of onli on piec of meatit is certainli a conveni
method and as the kid and pan ar usual kept perfectli clean a
neat and simpl on i had suppos these thing to be gener
known until i heard a few month ago a lawyer of reput who ha had
a good deal to do with marin case ask a sailor upon the stand
whether the crew had got up from tabl when a certain thing happen

hardship of a coast servic in the winter but captain wilson tell
me that the climat ha alter that the southeast ar no longer
the bane of the coast thei onc were and that vessel now anchor

that an unromant sailless sparless enginedriven hulk
i land in the surf in the old style but it wa not high enough to
excit us the onli chang be that i wa somehow unaccount a

run her up by the gunwal
santa barbara ha gain but littl i should not know from anyth
i saw that she wa now a seaport of the unit state a part of the
enterpris yanke nation and not still a lifeless mexican town at
the same old hous where seor noriego live on the piazza in front
of the courtyard where wa the gai scene of the marriag of our

augustia danc don pablo de la guerra receiv me in a courtli
fashion i pass the dai with the famili and in walk about the
place and at the old dinner with it accompani of frijol
nativ oliv and grape and nativ wine in due time i paid my
respect to doa augustia and notwithstand what wilson told me i
could hardli believ that after twentyfour year there would still be
so much of the enchant woman about her
she thank me for the kind and as she call them greatli
exagger compliment i had paid her and her daughter told me that
all travel who came to santa barbara call to see her mother and
that she herself never expect to live long enough to be a bell
mr alfr robinson our agent in 18356 wa here with a part of hi
famili i did not know how he would receiv me rememb what i had
print to the world about him at a time when i took littl thought
that the world wa go to read it but there wa no sign of offenc
onli cordial which gave him as between us rather the advantag in

the peopl of thi region ar give attent to sheeprais
winemak and the rais of oliv just enough to keep the town
from go backward
but even is draw on and our boat sail tonight so refus a

interior with it mine and agricultur wealth and rapidli fill
popul and it larg citi so far from the coast with their

materi aid and as georg mother told me on my return had with
medic aid and store and a clergyman made the boi end as
comfort and hope as possibl
the alert made two more voyag to the coast of california success
and without a mishap as usual and wa sold by messr bryant and
sturgi in 1843 to mr thoma w william a merchant of new london
connecticut who emploi her in the whaletrad in the pacif she

dear siri am happi to acknowledg the receipt of your favor of the
14th inst and to answer your inquiri about the good ship alert i
bought her of messr bryant and sturgi in the year 1843 for my firm
of william and haven for a whaler in which busi she wa
success until captur by the rebel steamer alabama septemb
1862 make a period of more than nineteen year dure which she
took and deliv at new london upward of twentyf thousand
barrel of whale and sperm oil she sail last from thi port august
30 1862 for hurd island the newli discov land south of
kerguelen command by edwin church and wa captur and burn on
the 9th of septemb follow onli ten dai out near or close to the
azor with thirti barrel of sperm oil on board and while her boat
were off in pursuit of whale
the alert wa a favorit ship with all owner offic and men who
had anyth to do with her and i mai add almost all who heard her
name ask if that wa the ship the man went in who wrote the book
call two year befor the mast and thu we feel with you no
doubt a sort of sympathi at her loss and that too in such a manner
and by wick act of our own countrymen
my partner mr haven send me a note from the offic thi p m
sai that he had just found the last logbook and would send up thi
even a copi of the last entri on it and if there should be anyth
of import i will enclos it to you and if you have ani further
inquiri to put i will with great pleasur endeavor to answer them
remain veri respectfulli and truli your
thoma w william
p ssinc write the abov i have receiv the extract from the
logbook and enclos the same
the last entri in the logbook of the alert
septemb 9 1862
shortli after the ship came to the wind with the main yard aback we
went alongsid and were hoist up when we found we were prison of
war and our ship a prize to the confeder steamer alabama we were
then order to give up all nautic instrument and letter
appertain to ani of us afterward we were offer the privileg
as thei call it of join the steamer or sign a parol of honor
not to serv in the armi or navi of the unit state thank god no
on accept the former of these offer we were all then order to
get our thing readi in hast to go on shoreth ship run off
shore all the time we were allow four boat to go on shore in and
when we had got what thing we could take in them were order to get
into the boat and pull for the shoreth nearest land be about
fourteen mile offwhich we reach in safeti and shortli after
saw the ship in flame
so end all our bright prospect blast by a gang of miscreant who
certainli can have no regard for human so long as thei continu to
foster their socal peculiar institut which is now destroi
our countri
i love to think that our nobl ship with her long record of good
servic and uniform success attract and belov in her life should
have pass at her death into the lofti region of intern
jurisprud and debat form a part of the bodi of the alabama
claim that like a true ship commit to her element onc for all
at her launch she perish at sea and without an extrem us of
languag we mai sai a victim in the caus of her countri
