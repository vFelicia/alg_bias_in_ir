introduct
in popular esteem the butterfli among the insect ar what the bird
ar among the higher animalsth most attract and beauti
member of the great group to which thei belong thei ar primarili
dai flier and ar remark for the delicaci and beauti of their
membran wing cover with myriad of tini scale that overlap on
anoth like the shingl on a hous and show an infinit varieti of
hue through the color of the scale and their arrang upon the
transluc membran run between the wing vein it is thi
characterist structur of the wing that give to the great order of
butterfli and moth it name lepidoptera mean scalewing
in the gener structur of the bodi the butterfli resembl other
insect there ar three chief divis head thorax and abdomen
the head bear the princip sens organ the thorax the organ of
locomot and the abdomen the organ of reproduct
by examin a butterfli head through a len it is easi to see the
princip appendag which it bear project forward from the
middl of the top is a pair of long feeler or antenna each of these
consist of short joint which in gener mai be divid into three
group first a few larg joint at the base connect the feeler
with the head second mani rather small joint which make up the
princip length third sever larger joint which make up the outer
part or club of the antenn in the case of the skipper there ar
in addit a number of small joint come to a sharp point at the
end of the club just below the insert of the antenna on each side
of the head ar the larg compound ey which ar almost
hemispher with a power glass on can see the honeycomblik
facet of which there ar thousand make up each ey just below
the ey there ar two hairi project call the palpi between
which is the coil tongu or suck tube see plate page 6465
illustr butterfli antenna magnifi from holland
anatom the thorax is divid into three partsth prothorax
the mesathorax and the metathorax but the line of divis between
these part ar not easili seen without denud the skin of it hairi
cover the prothorax bear the first pair of leg the mesathorax
bear the front pair of wing and the second pair of leg the
metathorax bear the hind pair of wing and the third pair of leg in
mani butterfli the first pair of leg ar so reduc in size that
thei ar not us in walk
the abdomen is compos of eight or nine distinct ring or segment
most of which have two spiracl or breath pore on on each side
it also bear upon the end of the bodi the ovipositor of the femal
or the clasp organ of the male
butterfli transform
the butterfli furnish the best known exampl of insect
transform the chang from the egg to the caterpillar or larva
from the caterpillar to the pupa or chrysali and from the chrysali
to the butterfli or imago is doubtless the most gener known fact
concern the life histori of insect it is a typic exampl of
what ar call complet transform as distinguish from the
manner of growth of grasshopp cricket and mani other insect in
which the young that hatch from the egg bear a gener resembl
to the adult and in which there is no quiet chrysali stage when the
littl creatur is unabl to eat or to move about
illustr egg of baltimor butterfli much magnifi
from holland
the growth of the caterpillar
caterpillar ar like snake in at least on respect in order to
provid for their increas in size thei shed their skin when a
caterpillar hatch from the egg it is a tini creatur with a soft
skin over most of it bodi but with rather a firm cover for it
head while we might fanci that there could be a consider increas
in size provid for by the stretch of the soft skin it is easi to
see that the hard cover of the head will not admit of thi so the
stori of the growth of a caterpillar mai be told in thi wai
a butterfli lai an egg upon a leaf some dai later the egg hatch
into a larva which is the technic name for the second stage of an
insect life in the case of the butterfli we call thi larva a
caterpillar the littl caterpillar is like to take it first meal
by eat the empti egg shell thi is a curiou habit and a realli
satisfactori explan of it seem not to have been made it next
meal is like to be taken from the green tissu of the leaf
commonli the green outer surfac onli be eaten at thi time the
futur meal ar also taken from the leaf more and more be eaten
as the larva get older
after a few dai of thi feed upon the leaf tissu the littl
caterpillar becom so crowd within the skin with which it wa born
that it is necessari to have a larger on so a new skin begin to
form beneath the first on consequ the latter split open in a
straight line part wai down the middl of the back just behind the
head then the new head cover is withdrawn from the old on and the
caterpillar wriggl it wai out of the split skin and find itself
cloth in a new on at first all of the tissu of the new skin ar
soft and pliabl and thei easili take on a larger size as the bodi of
the caterpillar expand a littl later these tissu becom harden
and no further expans is possibl
thi process of skinshed is call moult the cast skin is
often call the exuvia the period of the caterpillar life between
the hatch from the egg and thi moult is often call a stage or
instarthat is the caterpillar up to the time of thi moult is
live in the first caterpillar stage or instar
dure the actual moult the caterpillar is quit activ in free
itself from the exuvia but as soon as it is free it is like to
rest quietli for some hour while the tissu of the new skin ar
harden then it begin feed upon the leaf again and continu
take it meal at more or less regular interv for sever dai
by that time it will again have reach it limit of growth within
thi second skin and the process of moult must be repeat it
take place in the same wai as befor and the caterpillar enter upon
the third instar of it larval life
thi process of feed and moult is continu for sever week
the number of moult be usual four dure the later stage the
increas in size is more mark each time the skin is shed until the
caterpillar final reach it full growth as a larva and is readi
for the wonder chang to the quiet chrysali in which all it
caterpillar organ ar to be transform into the veri differ
organ of the butterfli
in the case of butterfli larva on of the most interest featur
of the growth of the caterpillar is that of the remark chang in
color and pattern of mark which the caterpillar undergo on
who had not follow these chang would often be at a loss to
recogn caterpillar of slightli differ size as belong to the
same speci these chang commonli show a remark adapt to
the condit of life and gener tend to the conceal of the
caterpillar upon it food plant the stage of growth of the
greencloud swallowtail caterpillar ar illustr on plate
opposit page 80
befor each moult the caterpillar is like to spin a silken web upon
the leaf surfac it then entangl it claw in the web to hold
itself in place while the skin is cast see plate page 17
the chang to the chrysali
see plate page 3233
a week or ten dai after the last moult of it caterpillar growth the
larva commonli becom full fed and readi to chang to the chrysali
state the detail of the wai in which thi is accomplish vari
greatli with differ butterfli as will be note in the stori of
mani speci later in thi book in gener howev the caterpillar
provid a web of silk which it spin against some surfac where the
chrysali will be secur and in thi web it entangl it hind leg
sometim there is the addit protect of a loop of silk over
the front end of the bodi after the leg have becom entangl the
caterpillar hang downward until the skin split open along the median
line of the back and gradual shrink upward until it is almost free
show as it come off a curiou creatur which ha some of the
characterist featur of a chrysali it is seldom at thi stage of
the same shape as the chrysali when the caterpillar skin is nearli
off thi chrysalislik object usual wriggl it bodi quickli in a
manner to entangl a curiou set of hook attach to the upper end in
the web of silken thread thi hooklik project is call the
cremast and it serv a veri import purpos in hold the
chrysali in posit
illustr swallowtail chrysali show b the loop of
silk over thorax after rilei
as soon as the cremast is entangl in the web the cast skin usual
fall off and for a veri short period the creatur hang seem to be
neither caterpillar nor chrysali it is in fact in a transit stage
between the two and it veri soon shorten up and take on the
definit form of the chrysali the outer tissu harden into the
characterist chrysali skin
from the fact that thi chrysali skin show mani of the
characterist featur of the futur butterfli it is evid that the
chang from the caterpillar to the butterfli realli began dure the
life of the larva the natur of the process by which thi chang
take place ha long been a puzzl to scientist for the make of a
butterfli is on of the most wonder phenomena in the outer world
and it ha challeng the attent of mani acut observ some two
centuri ago the great dutch naturalist swammerdam studi veri
carefulli the develop of mani insect especi the butterfli
he found that if he place in boil water a caterpillar that wa
readi to pupat or becom a chrysali the outer skin could easili be
remov reveal beneath the immatur butterfli with welldevelop
leg and antenna from these observ he wa led to believ that
the process of growth wa simpli a process of unfold that is as
professor packard ha express it that the form of the larva pupa
and imago prexist in the egg and even in the ovari and that the
insect in these stage were distinct anim contain on insid
the other like a nest of box or a seri of envelop on within
the other thi wa call the incas theori and it wa held to
be correct by naturalist for nearli a centuri it wa discredit
howev about a hundr year ago but not until anoth fifti year
had pass wa it definit replac by anoth and much more
convinc theori propound by weismann
accord to weismann theori which is now wellestablish the
process of develop intern is a much more continu on than
the extern chang would indic so far as the latter ar
concern we simpli sai that a caterpillar chang to a chrysali and
a chrysali to a butterfli the transit in each case requir but
a veri short time intern howev it ha been go on almost
continu from the earli life of the caterpillar the variou
organ of the butterfli aris from certain germin disk or
imagin bud the word imagin in thi case be an adject
form of imago so that the imagin bud ar realli simpli bud for
the start of growth of the variou organ of the imago or adult as
the caterpillar approach the chrysali period these imagin bud
rapidli develop into the variou organ of the butterfli thi process
is help along by the break down of mani of the tissu of the
larva thi brokendown tissu be then util for the product
of the new organ about the time the chrysali is form thi
breakingdown process becom veri gener so that the newli form
chrysali seem larg a mass of creami materi which is soon us
to build up the variou part of the butterfli through the growth of
the imagin bud
the chang to the butterfli
see plate page 3233
there is probabl no phenomenon in the world of live creatur which
ha attract more attent than the chang of the chrysali into the
butterfli it is not strang that thi is so we see upon a tree or
shrub or wall an inert appar lifeless object have no
definit form with which we can compar it with other thing have
neither ey nor ear nor wing nor legsan object appar of as
littl interest as a lifeless piec of rock a few minut later we
behold it again and note with astonish that thi appar
inanim be ha been suddenli transform into the most ether
of the creatur of earth with an exquisit beauti that cannot fail
to attract admir with wing of most delic structur for
fly through the air with ey of a thousand facet with organ of
smell that baffl the ingenu of man to explain with vibrant
antenna and a slender tongu adapt to feed upon the nectar of
flowersth most ambrosi of natur food so it is not strang that
thi emerg of a butterfli ha long been the theme both of poet
and theologian and that it attract the admir attent of
childhood youth and ag
fortun thi chang from chrysali to butterfli mai readili be
observ by ani on who will take a littl troubl to rear the
caterpillar or to watch chrysalid found outdoor the precis method
of eclos as we call thi new kind of hatch vari somewhat
with differ speci but in gener the process is similar in all
those chrysalid which have a light color outer skin ar especi
desir if we would watch thi process on can see through the
semitranspar membran the develop butterfli within until
final just befor it is readi to break out the mark of the
wing and bodi show distinctli if at thi time the chrysali is
place in the sunshin it is like to come out at onc so that you
can observ it readili it usual break apart over the head and the
newli releas leg quickli grasp hold of the empti skin as well as of
the support to which it is attach it then hang downward with a
veri larg abdomen and with the wing more or less crumpl up but
decidedli larger than when thei were confin within the chrysali
the wing howev soon begin to lengthen as thei ar stretch out
probabl through the fill of the space by the bodi juic
commonli the hind pair of wing becom full size befor the front
on in a short time the wing attain their full size the abdomen
becom smaller through the discharg of a liquid call meconium
and the butterfli is like to walk a few step to a better posit
where it will rest quietli for an hour or two while bodi and wing
tissu harden after thi it is like to fly awai to lead the free
life of a butterfli see plate page 16
these chang from larva to chrysali and from chrysali to adult in
the case of the monarch butterfli ar illustr on the plate
opposit page 3233 a littl studi of these photograph from life
will help greatli to an understand of the process
some veri interest observ have been made by mr j alston
moffat upon the method of the expans of the wing in summar
hi investig he write
when a wing is fulli expand and for an hour or two after the
membran can be easili separ entranc for a pinpoint between
them is to be found at the base of the wing where the subcost and
median nervur come close togeth the membran ar unit at the
costal and inner edg which have to be cut to get them apart but
thei ar free at the outer angl at that time the nervur ar in two
part half in on membran and half in the other and open in the
centr the fluid which ha been store up in the pupa enter the
winglet at the open refer to expand the membran as it
pass along between them and the nervur at the same time and when
it ha extend to everi portion of the wing then it is fulli
expand the expand fluid is of a gummi consist and as it
dri cement the membran togeth also the edg of the
halfnervur and produc the hollow tube with which we ar so
familiar
butterfli and moth
the butterfli and moth both belong to the great order of
scalewing insectsth lepidoptera thei ar distinguish
howev by certain gener characterist which hold true for the
most part in both group the butterfli fly by dai the moth fly by
night all of the higher butterfli go into the chrysali state
without make a silken cocoon while most of the higher moth make
such a cocoon the bodi of the butterfli ar usual slender
while those of the larger moth ar stout the antenna of the
butterfli ar gener slender and commonli enlarg at the tip
into a miniatur club the antenna of the larger moth ar commonli
featheri or ar long and slender taper gradual toward the tip
illustr butterfli wing scale magnifi

the characterist featur that distinguish a moth from a butterfli
ar well illustr in the plate opposit page 49 which show on of
the largest and most beauti moth in the world it is the cynthia
moth as mai be seen the newli emerg moth is rest upon the
silken cocoon in which it spent it period as a pupa or chrysali
thi cocoon wa attach by the caterpillar to the twig from which it
hang at the time it spun the cocoon the feather antenna the
hairi leg the thick thorax and larg abdomenal show veri clearli
in thi side view of the moth as will be seen the wing ar larg
and veri suggest of those of a butterfli and have the
characterist eyespot toward the tip and the crescent mark in the
middl which ar so often found on the wing of the larger moth
some of these larg moth on cloudi dai occasion fly dure
daylight and by the uniniti thei ar often mistaken for larg
butterfli on who will notic their structur howev will
readili see the characterist featur of the moth
in the caterpillar stage there ar no hard and fast differ
between the larva of butterfli and those of the higher moth in
each case the insect consist of a wormlik bodi have a small
head provid with bite jaw and simpl ey or ocelli back of the
head ar the three ring of the thorax each of which bear a pair of
joint leg back of these three ring there ar a consider
number of other bodi ring make up the abdomen on the middl of
which there ar commonli four or five pair of fleshi proleg not
joint but furnish at the tip with fine claw at the hind end of
the bodi there is anoth pair of proleg similar in structur
the scent of butterfli
mani student of american butterfli have occasion mention the
fact that certain speci seem to give off a distinct scent which ha
frequent been spoken of as a pleas fragranc suggest
sandalwood or some other aromat odor the gener subject as
exemplifi by butterfli of other land ha been studi for mani
year by fritz mller and certain english entomologist have paid
consider attent to it a translat of the mller public
and an excel summari of our present knowledg of the subject is
publish in dr longstaff book on butterfli hunt
the odor given off by butterfli ar divid into two princip
kind name first those which ar repuls to the sens of man
and evid for the purpos of protect the butterfli from bird
and other vertebr enemiesthes ar found in both sex second
those which ar evid for the purpos of sexual attract and
confin to the male butterfliesthes scent ar usual attract
to the sens of man
illustr androconia from wing of male butterfli
the aromat scent of the second group ar gener produc by
mean of certain scale or hair of mani curiou form which ar
scatter over the surfac of the wing or ar place within certain
special pocket gener near the border of the wing these scale
or hair ar call androconia some of them much magnifi ar
repres in the pictur abov
our knowledg of the scent given off by american butterfli is veri
fragmentari and it is highli desir that mani more observ
should be made upon the subject if collector gener would make
care note both in the field and upon the freshli kill
butterfli at home we ought soon to be abl greatli to extend our
knowledg by hold the butterfli with a pair of forcep on can
often determin whether the fragranc is emit it is often help
also to brush the hair or tuft where the androconia ar attach
us a small dry camel hair brush for the purpos
butterfli migrat
migrat seem to be a gener instinct in the anim world
develop when a speci becom enorm abund at such time
thi instinct appar overcom all other and the creatur move
on regardless of obstacl and condit that mai mean certain death
to the vast major such migrat among mammal have often been
record on of the most notabl exampl be that of the littl
lem which migrat at period interv in a wai which ha
often been describ among the insect such migrat have been
frequent notic and the phenomenon ha appar been observ
often among the butterfli than in ani other group entomolog
literatur dure the last hundr year contain a great mani record
of enorm flight of butterfli over long distanc extend even
from africa into europ or from on part of america to anoth far
remot as such migrat is like to happen whenev a speci
becom extrem abund it probabl is natur wai of provid
for an extend food suppli for the succeed gener that it
result in the death of the great major of the migrant is
doubtless true but it must lead to vast experi in extend the

the migrat thu consid ar onli except occurr there
is howev a regularli recur annual migrat on the part of
some butterfli which is also a phenomenon of extraordinari interest
the most notabl exampl is that of the monarch which appar
follow the bird southward everi autumn and come northward again in
spring there is much evid to indic that in some slight degre
other butterfli have a similar habit although the present
observ ar inadequ to determin to what extent thi habit ha
becom fix in most of these speci
hibern or winter lethargi
the wai in which butterfli spend the winter ar alwai of peculiar
interest to the naturalist here ar creatur with four distinct
stage of exist each of which ha the possibl of carri the
speci through the season of cold it is necessari to learn for each
insect which stage ha been chosen for the purpos and if possibl to
find the reason for the choic
as a rule the relat member of a group ar like to hibern in a
similar stage thu most of the swallowtail pass the winter as
chrysalid while practic all the anglew pass the winter as
adult thi rule howev ha mani except for on will often
find close relat speci which differ in the stage of hibern
as on would expect the condit of hibern vari greatli with
the latitud in the sever climat of the far north the condit
ar like to be more uniform than in the south where the milder
climat permit greater variat to the insect in some case where a
butterfli hibern in onli on stage in canada it mai pass the
winter in two or more stage in alabama or florida
in mani other order of insect the egg is a favorit stage for
hibern even in the close relat moth it is often chosen by
mani speci but compar few butterfli pass the winter in the
egg stage the littl bronz copper mai serv as on exampl of thi
limit group
the condit as to hibern by the larva of butterfli ar veri
differ from those of the egg it ha been estim that probabl
half of all our speci pass the winter in some stage of caterpillar
growth thi vari all the wai from the newli hatch caterpillar
which hibern without tast food to the fulli grown caterpillar
which hibern full fed and chang to a chrysali in spring without
eat anyth at that time a larg proport howev feed both
in fall and spring go through the winter when approxim half
grown
the grayl and the fritillari ar typic exampl of butterfli
which hibern as newli hatch larva the egg ar laid in autumn
upon or near the food plant and the caterpillar gnaw their wai out
of the shell and seek seclus at onc find such shelter as thei
mai in the materi on the soil surfac in spring thei begin to feed
as soon as the weather permit and complet their growth from then
on
the halfgrown caterpillar mai hibern either as free creatur
under board stone or in the turfi grass or thei mai be protect
by special shelter which thei have provid for themselv in their
earlier life in the case of the latter each mai have a shelter of it
own or there mai be a common shelter for a coloni of caterpillar
among the exampl of those hibern in miscellan situat
without special protect the caterpillar of the tawni emperor the
grai emperor the pearl crescent and some of the grayl ar
exampl among those which hibern in individu shelter the
sovereign among which our common viceroi is most familiar ar good
exampl among those which hibern in a tent woven by the whole
coloni for the whole coloni the baltimor or phaeton butterfli is
perhap the best exampl
the caterpillar that hibern when full grown mai be group in a
wai somewhat similar to those which ar half grown mani speci
simpli find such shelter as thei mai at or near the soil surfac the
cloud sulphur is a good exampl of these other pass the winter in
individu shelter made from a leaf or blade sever of the larger
skipper ar good exampl of thi condit so far as i know none of
our speci pass the winter in coloni shelter when full grown
it would be natur to suppos that the great major of butterfli
would be like to hibern in the chrysali state here is a quiet
stage in which the insect is unabl to move about or to take ani food
in which it seem entir dormant and as a rule is fairli well hidden
from the view of enemi we find howev that onli a rather small
proport of our butterfli ha chosen thi stage for surviv
through the winter the most conspicu exampl ar the
swallowtail nearli all of which hibern in the chrysali stage
other exampl ar the variou white the orangetip and isol
speci like the wander and the spring azur and the american
copper practic all the butterfli that pass the winter as
chrysalid have a silken loop run around near the middl of the
bodi which help to hold them secur through the long winter month
appar none of those chrysalid which hang straight downward ar
abl to surviv the winter
an adult butterfli seem a fragil creatur to endur the long cold
month of arctic region yet mani of our most beauti speci
habitu hibern as adult find shelter in such situat as
hollow tree the crevic in rock the open beneath loos bark
or even the outer bark on the under side of a larg branch it is
signific that most of the adultwint anglew ar northern
rather than southern speci some of them be found in arctic
region practic around the world on of the few southern form
that hibern as an adult is the goatwe emperor
these exampl ar all case of true hibern in a letharg
condit there ar certain butterfli howev which pass the
winter as adult that remain activ dure thi period obvious thi
is imposs in latitud where the winter is sever and it involv
migrat to a warmer climat the on notabl illustr of thi is
the monarch butterfli which appar fli southward to the gulf
state at least and there remain until spring when individu come
north again the southward migrat mai be begun in canada when the
butterfli gather togeth in enorm flock that remind on of the
gather of the clan with the migrat bird thi is on of the
least understood of insect activ but it ha been observ so
often and over so long a period of year that there seem to be no
question the gener habit
like everyth els in relat to live thing there ar numer
variat in the prevail mode of hibern in the case of mani
speci on can find combin of two or more stage in which the
winter is pass probabl if we could observ with suffici care we
might be abl to find somewher exampl of almost ani conceiv
doubl combinationa egg with larva or chrysali or adultth
insect hibern in two of these stage mani exampl ar known in
which both chrysali and adult of the same speci pass the winter and
also of those in which young and wellgrown larva pass the winter as
on would expect the condit as to such combin ar like to
be more variabl in southern than in northern region
notwithstand all the attent which ha been paid to butterfli
lifehistori there is still some uncertainti in regard to the
hibern of mani of our speci on of the most interest seri
of observ which a young naturalist could undertak would be to
learn posit how each speci of butterfli in hi local pass
the winter
aestiv or summer lethargi
in some speci of butterfli there is a special adapt to
pass through the hottest part of the summer season in a state of
lethargi which is suggest of the torpor of the hibern period
thi phase of butterfli exist ha not been extens studi and
there ar indic that it exist more gener than ha been
commonli suppos it ha been notic even in northern new england
that some of the anglew seek shelter and becom letharg dure
august appar thi is an adapt to singl brooded
help to carri the speci through the year without the exhaust
incid to the continu activ of the butterfli
in more southern region especi in the hot dry climat where
veget wither in midsumm it is well known that some
caterpillar becom letharg remain inact until the fall rain
start veget into growth the orangesulphur butterfli is a good
exampl of thi
thi summer lethargi offer excel opportun for care studi
ani observ who find a butterfli hidden awai in summer under board
the bark of a tree or in a stone pile should look carefulli to see
what speci it is and how the butterfli behav such observ
should be sent to the entomolog journal in order that our
knowledg of the subject mai be increas
feign death
the fact ha long been notic that variou butterfli have the habit
at time of feign death and drop to the ground where thei mai
lie motionless for a consider period thi habit is most easili
observ in some of the anglew especi those which hibern
as adult those speci have the under surfac of their wing
color in variou barkpictur pattern and appar live
through the winter to some extent rest beneath the bark of larg
branch or upon the trunk of tree mani of them also secret
themselv in hollow tree or beneath loos bark or in board pile or
stone wall it is probabl howev that dure the long ag when
these insect were adapt themselv to their life condit
befor man interf with the natur order and furnish variou
more or less artifici place for hibern these butterfli
rest more gener upon the under side of branch than thei do
now
even in warm weather when on of these butterfli is suddenli
disturb it is like to fold it leg upon it bodi and drop to the
ground allow itself to be handl without show ani sign of
life thi habit is doubtless of valu especi dure hibern
or possibl dure the summer lethargi or aestiv the latter a
habit which mai be more gener among these butterfli than is now
suppos as the insect li motionless upon the ground it is veri
like to blend so thoroughli with it surround that it becom
conceal and ani bird which had startl it from the branch abov
would have difficulti in find it
some veri interest observ have been made upon the
deathfeign instinct of variou other insect especi the
beetl but no on so far as i know ha yet made an extend studi of
the subject in relat to our american butterfli it is an
excel field for investig and offer unusu opportun for

color
the caterpillar of butterfli and moth form a larg part of the
food of insect bird these caterpillar ar especi adapt
for such a purpos and in the economi of natur thei plai a veri
import part in keep aliv the feather tribe dure the long
ag through which both bird and insect have been develop side by
side there have been mani remark interrel establish
which tend on the on hand to prevent the bird from extermin the
insect and on the other to prevent the insect from caus the bird
to starv the most import of these so far as the caterpillar ar
concern ar the variou devic by which these insect protect
themselv from attack by hide awai where bird ar not like to
find them by cloth their bodi with spini hair by other method
of render themselv distast or by variou phase of
conceal color on the whole the exampl of the latter ar
not so numer or so easili found in the case of the larva of
butterfli as in those of moth
perhap the basal principl of conceal color is the law of
countershad first partial announc by prof e b poulton and
later much more elabor work out by mr abbott h thayer and
discuss at length by mr gerald h thayer in hi remark volum
conceal color in the anim kingdom the law of
countershad is ters state in these word anim ar paint
by natur darkest on those part which tend to be most light by the
sky light and vice versa as thi law work out on most anim
that live on or near the ground the upper part of the bodi expos
to the direct light from abov is dark and the under part shut off
from the upper light and receiv onli the small reflect from
below is enough lighter to make the appear of the creatur in it
natur environ of a uniform tone from back to breast
nearli all caterpillar illustr thi law of countershad if
thei ar in the habit of feed or rest with their feet downward
the back will be darker and the under side lighter but if thei ar in
the habit of feed or rest in the opposit posit these color
tone will be revers on can find exampl of such condit
almost ani summer dai by a littl search of tree or shrub
thi law of countershad howev is realli onli the basi for the
color of caterpillar or other anim it tend chiefli to
make the creatur appear as a flat plane when seen from the side and
mai be said in a wai to prepar the canva upon which natur paint
her more distinct pictur a great mani exampl of color mark
that tend to conceal the caterpillar amid it natur surround mai
be found by ani on who will studi the subject and it offer on of
the most interest field for investig the chapter on
caterpillar in the abovement book by mr thayer should serv as
a start point for ani on take up the subject
butterfli differ from caterpillar and from most other anim in
the fact that their color is chiefli shown upon the flat surfac
of the wing consequ there is less opportun for the variou
phase of countershad which is so commonli shown in the larger
caterpillar the bodi of nearli all butterfli do exhibit thi
phenomenon but these bodi ar rel so small that
countershad plai but a littl part in the gener displai
upon the outstretch membran of the butterfli wing natur
through the long ag of develop ha paint a great varieti of
pictur those which tend to protect the insect by conceal amid
it surround ar most commonli spread on the under surfac of the
wing especi is thi true in the case of those speci which pass
the winter as adult or which have the habit of rest upon the bark
of tree the side of rock or the surfac of the ground we here
find some of the most interest exampl of oblit color
that occur in natur some butterfli have taken on the look of tree
bark other the sombr appear of weather rock while still
other ar paint with the imag of floweret and their stem
dazzl and eclips color
mani of the butterfli especi the anglew which ar mark
on the under surfac in variou protect color ar admir
exampl of that phase of anim color which is spoken of as
dazzl color thi is appar on of the most import
protect devic to be found in natur and the valid of it is now
gener conced by naturalist on phase of it which mai be
call eclips color seem to have been first definit
formul by the late lord walsingham a famou english entomologist
who enunci it in an address as presid of the entomolog
societi of london the most signific paragraph in that address
were these
my attent wa late drawn to a passag in herbert spencer
essai on the moral of trade he write as when tast differ
food or wine the palat is disabl by someth strongli flavor
from appreci the more delic flavor of anoth thing afterward
taken so with the other organ of sens a temporari disabl
follow an excess stimul thi hold not onli with the ey in
judg of color but also with the finger in judg of textur
here i think we have an explan of the principl on which
protect is undoubtedli afford to certain insect by the
possess of bright color on such part of their wing or bodi
as can be instantli cover and conceal at will it is an undoubt
fact and on which must have been observ by nearli all collector
of insect abroad and perhap also in our own countri that it is
more easi to follow with the ey the rapid movement of a more
conspicu insect soberli and uniformli color than those of an
insect capabl of chang in an instant the appear it present
the ey have onc fix itself upon an object of a certain form and
color convei to the mind a correspond impress and if that
impress is suddenli found to be unreli the instruct which
the mind convei to the ey becom also unreli and the rapid
with which the impress and consequ instruct can be chang
cannot alwai compet successfulli with the rapid transform
effect by the insect in it effort to escap
lord walsingham then goe on to suggest that thi intermitt plai of
bright color probabl ha as confus effect upon bird and other
predac vertebr as upon man and that on thi hypothesi such
color can be account for more satisfactorili than upon ani other
yet suggest sinc then the signific of thi theori ha been
repeatedli point out by professor poulton mr abbott h thayer and
variou other author upon anim color the term dazzl
and eclips have been appli to the phenomenon
shortli after lord walsingham propound thi theori i call
attent a to it fit in explain some of the most interest
color phase shown by american insect notabl the moth and locust
which have brilliantli color under wing and protect color
upper wing
a popular scienc monthli 1898 a game of hide and seek
reprint in the insect world 1899
the anim of the north show numberless color phase of interest on
of the most curiou of these is exhibit by sever famili of
insect in which the outer wing ar protect color in dull hue
and the under wing brightli color for exampl there ar mani
speci of moth belong to the genu catocala found throughout the
unit state these ar insect of good size the larger on
measur three inch in expans of wing and the major of them
be at least two third that size most of them live dure the dai
on the bark of tree with their front wing fold togeth over the
back the color and mark of these wing as well as of the rest
of the expos portion of the bodi ar such as to assimil close
with the bark of the tree upon which the insect rest in such a
situat it requir a sharp ey to detect the presenc of the moth
which unless disturb fli onli at night remain all dai
expos to the attack of mani enemi probabl the most import of
these ar the bird especi speci like the woodpeck which
ar constantli explor all portion of the trunk of tree
the chief beauti of these catocala as thei ar seen spread out in
the museum cabinet li in the fact that the hind wing which when
the moth is at rest in life ar conceal by the front on ar
brightli color in contrast hue of black red and white in
variou brilliant combin these color in connect with the
soft and blend tone of the front wing make a veri handsom
insect
it is easi to see that when on of these underw moth is driven to
flight by a woodpeck or other barksearch bird it would show
dure it rapid irregular flight the bright color of the under
wing which would be instantli hidden upon alight and the veri
differ color of the upper wing blend with the bark would be
substitut consequ the bird would be veri like to be baffl
in it pursuit
color of locust
on the rocki hill and sandi plain of new england there ar sever
speci of grasshopp or locust that also illustr these
principl if you walk along a strip of sandi land in summer you
start to flight certain locust which soon alight and when search
for will be found close to assimil in color the sand upon which
thei rest on a neighbor graniterib hill you will find few if
ani of thi speci of locust but instead there occur two or three
quit differ speci which when at rest close resembl the
lichencov rock thi resembl is veri strike and is found
in all stage of the insect exist if now you go to a lowland
meadow still anoth color phase will be found to prevailth green
grass is swarm with the socal longhorn grasshopp
which ar green throughout with linear bodi and long slender leg
and antenna
each of these three group of insect is adapt to it particular
habitat all ar constantli persecut by bird and have been so
persecut for unnumb ag in the past in everi gener the
individu have vari some toward closer resembl to
environ other in an opposit direct the more conspicu
insect have been constantli taken and the least conspicu as
constantli left to reproduc were the three group to chang place
todai the green grasshopp from the meadow go to sandi
surfac the sandcolor locust go to rocki hill and the
mossback from the hill to the lowland meadow each would becom
conspicu and the bird would have such a feast as is seldom spread
befor them
the speci live on sand and rock ar often flush by bird
those which flew but a few feet would be like to be captur by the
pursu bird those which flew farther would stand a better chanc of
escap similarli those which flew slowli and in a straight line
would be more like to be caught than those which flew rapidli and
took a zigzag cours as a consequ of the select thu brought
about through the elimin of those which flew slowli along the
straight and narrow wai that led to death you will find that most
locust live in expos situat when startl fly some distanc
in a rapid zigzag manner
but still anoth element of safeti ha been introduc by some
speci of these locust through the adopt of the color tactic of
the catocala moth the under wing of the common carolina locustth
speci most abund along the highwayar black border with
yellowish white the base of the hind wing of a relat speci
live on the western plain is bluish while in the larg
coralwing locust of the eastern state the hind wing ar red
border with black in nearli all of the speci of these locust
frequent open local where thei ar liabl to disturb by
bird or other anim the hind wing exhibit contrast color in
flight most of them also fly in a zigzag line and alight in a most
errat manner mani time i have had difficulti in determin the
exact landfal of on of these peculiar creatur and i believ lord
walsingham suggest is well exemplifi in them see page 33
the most famou exampl of a combin of thi dazzl color of
the upper wing surfac with a definit protect color of the
under wing surfac is the kallima butterfli which is illustr in
almost everi book deal with anim color the under wing
surfac bear a strike resembl to a leaf and the hind wing
project to form a tail which look like the petiol of the leaf and
there is also a mark run across the wing which mimic the midrib
when the butterfli is fly the brilliant color of the upper surfac
ar visibl but when it alight these ar instantli replac by the
sombr tone of the under surfac so that appar the insect
complet disappear and in it place there is onli a leaf attach
to a branch in a most natur posit in dr longstaff book there
is an illustr of anoth tropic butterfli eronia cleodora
which resembl on it under surfac a yellow diseasestricken leaf
but on it upper surfac give a brilliant combin of black and
white thi insect alight upon the leav which it resembl and is
a strike exampl of both dazzl and mimick color
mani of our own butterfli notabl the anglew ar excel
exampl of a similar combin in flight thei reveal conspicu
color which ar instantli hidden upon alight and then on onli
see the barklik or dead leaflik under surfac as mai be seen in
the plate opposit page 160161 the iridesc upon the upper wing
surfac of mani butterfli whose under wing surfac is color in
conceal tone is doubtless also of great us to the insect in a
similar wai there is a splendid opportun here for some observ to
studi thi phase of butterfli activ and to get photograph of the
insect amid their natur surround
in their book upon conceal color the messr thayer have
call attent to mani interest phase of dazzl color
thei show that bright mark like the eyespot or ocelli which form
so promin a featur on the wing surfac of mani butterfli
realli help to conceal the insect amid it natur surround by
draw the ey awai from the outlin of wing and bodi so that the
latter tend to disappear their discuss of thi subject open up

select color sens
on who collect the underw moth soon discov that the light
color speci which resembl the bark of birch tree ar like to
be found upon the trunk of those tree and that the dark color
kind which resembl the bark of mapl tree ar like to be found
upon the trunk of these obvious were thi not true the protect
color would avail but littl and it is evid that these moth ar
abl to select a background which is of advantag in help to
conceal them
there is much evid to show that in a similar wai the butterfli
ar abl by mean of a welldevelop color sens to select the place
where thei alight on of the most notabl exampl is that of a south
american speci peridromia feronia thi is a silveri grai
butterfli which alight head downward upon the bark of certain palm
tree that have silveri grai stem and remain there with it wing
fulli expand so that it util the background in much the same wai
that the underw moth do when disturb thei will return to the
same tree again and again
on who will observ the habit of our anglew and other
butterfli which have oblit color of the under wing surfac
can easili learn that these insect select rather carefulli the place
where thei alight it will be found that as a rule each speci
util a background that blend with it own color it is
probabl that thi habit is much more common in other group of
butterfli than ha been realiz much evid of thi sort ha
been collect regard the butterfli of europ and other
countri as well as near our own border in america
warn color and mimicri
the color of a great mani anim includ a consider
percentag of american butterfli and their larva have been
commonli explain by the theori of warn color accord to
thi theori anim which were for ani reason not edibl by bird and
mammal have develop variou strike combin of color such as
black and yellow red and black or black and white in order to
advertis to their foe their ined qualiti thi theori ha been
veri gener accept by naturalist and will be found expound at
length in mani book publish dure the last quarter centuri
the whole subject of the valid of warn color ha recent
been brought up for reconsider by the illumin investig
of mr abbott h thayer and discuss at length in the book upon
conceal color alreadi mention in an appendix to thi book
date 1908 mr thayer state that he no longer hold the belief that
there must somewher be warn color he ha convincingli shown
that a larg proport of the anim which were suppos to be
exampl of thi theori ar realli illustr of conceal
color but there yet remain variou fact which have been
conclus proven that appar requir the theori of warn
color to explain them here is anoth field in which there is a real
need for much care investig under condit that ar rigidli
scientif
along with the theori of warn color the theori of mimicri
ha been propound accord to thi if a butterfli in a given
region show warn color have develop such color
becaus it is distast to bird and mammal it mai be mimick by
anoth butterfli in the same region belong to anoth group the
latter butterfli be edibl but benefit by it resembl to
the distast speci becaus bird or mammal mistak it for the
latter and do not attempt to catch it the most notabl exampl of
such mimicri in north america is that of the monarch butterfli which
is suppos to be the distast speci and the viceroi butterfli
which is suppos to mimic it sever other instanc of mimicri ar
found among our own butterfli while in south america africa and
asia there ar numberless exampl
heliotrop
it ha long been known that the green surfac of plant respond to
the stimulu of the sun rai in a most remark manner thi
respons ha commonli been call heliotrop and it ha been
carefulli studi by botanist all over the habit world more
recent the fact ha been observ that mani anim respond in
certain definit wai to the stimulu of direct sunshin and the same
term ha been appli in thi case veri littl attent ha been
given to the subject of heliotrop until within a few recent year
but the observ which have been made by parker longstaff dixei
and other open up a most interest field for further observ
an admir summari of our present knowledg of the subject ha been
publish by dr longstaff in hi book butterfli hunt in mani
land
on of the earliest observ upon thi subject wa that publish
in my book natur biographi which appear in june 1901
concern the habit in the mourn cloak on a springlik dai
earli in novemb the 8th i came across on of these butterfli
bask in the sunshin upon the ti of a railwai track it rest
with it wing wide open on be disturb it would fly a short
distanc and then alight and i wa interest to notic that after
alight it would alwai turn about until the hind end of it bodi
point in the direct of the sun so that the sun rai struck it
wing and bodi nearli at right angl i repeatedli observ thi
habit of get into the posit in which the most benefit from the
sunshin wa receiv and it is of interest as show the extrem
delicaci of percept toward the warmth of sunshin which these
creatur possess
a littl later some veri elabor observ were made upon thi
habit of the mourn cloak by prof g h parker of harvard
univers professor parker notic that dure the warm spell in
winter the butterfli came out of their hide place and after
alight alwai place themselv with their head awai from the
direct of the sun and their bodi ly nearli at right angl to
the sun rai by experi he found that thei adjust themselv
to thi posit as soon as thei were fulli expos to direct
sunshin even if at the time of alight thei were in a shadow he
found that thi movement wa a reflex action through the ey for
when the ey were blind no such adjust took place he call it
neg heliotrop
dr longstaff us the term orient for thi adjust of the
butterfli to the sun rai and he find it is a veri gener habit
especi with the anglew for the butterfli thu to orient
itself after alight in such a wai that the hind end of the bodi
point toward the sun thi occur not onli with those speci which
keep their wing spread open when thei alight but also with those in
which the wing ar close togeth and held in a vertic posit on
alight
variou explan of thi phenomenon have been offer but
appar none of them ar yet gener accept were the habit
confin to butterfli like the mourn cloak it would seem easi to
prove that a main advantag wa found in the benefit deriv from the
heat rai of the sun were it confin to those speci which alwai
fold their wing on alight it would seem easi to believ that it
wa a devic for reduc the shadow cast by the insect to it lowest
term it ha also been suggest that the habit is for the purpos of
reveal to the fullest extent the mark of the butterfli
evid there is here an ampl field for further investig
befor definit conclus ar reach
list and shadow observ
anoth field for most interest studi upon the habit of live
butterfli ha been open up by the veri interest discuss of
list and shadow in colonel g b longstaff fascin book
butterfli hunt in mani land he there summar hi numer
observ upon butterfli in variou local which he ha seen
to lean over at a decid angl when thei alight he defin list
as an attitud result from the rotat of the insect about it
longitudin axi as heliotrop result from a rotat about an
imaginari vertic axi at right angl to thi the name is adapt
from the sailor term appli to a vessel lean to on side or
anoth in a storm
appar thi interest habit wa first call to the attent of
european entomologist by an observ of colonel c t bingham
made in 1878 but not publish until long afterward the observ
wa thi
the melan wa there among dead leav it wing fold and
look for all the world a dead dry leaf itself with regard to
melan i have not seen it record anywher that the speci of
thi genu when disturb fly a littl wai drop suddenli into the
undergrowth with close wing and invari lie a littl askew and
slant which still more increas their like to a dead leaf
casual fallen to the ground
long befor thi wa print howev a similar habit had been
observ by scudder in the case of our white mountain butterfli
oeni semidea but thi speci is so except in it habitat
that the habit seem to have been consid a special adapt to
the windswept mountain top the possibl of it be at all
gener among the butterfli in lowland seem to have been
overlook
the observ record by longstaff relat chiefli to variou
member of the satyrid group for exampl a common grayl satyru
semel wa watch mani time as it settl on the ground as a rule
three motion ar gone through in regular sequenc the wing ar
brought togeth over the back the forew ar drawn between the
hind wing the whole is thrown over to right or left to the extent of
thirti forti or even fifti degre
thi habit of cours is of advantag to the insect it seem
possibl that the advantag might be explain in either of two wai
first the lean over on the ground among grass and fallen leav
might help to render the disguis color of the insect more
effect the larg ocelli serv to draw the ey awai from the
outlin of bodi and wing second the list of the butterfli toward
the sun tend to reduc the shadow and to hide it beneath the wing
there is no doubt that when a grayl butterfli light upon the
ground in strong sunshin the shadow it cast is more conspicu than
the insect itself and the hide of thi might be of distinct
advantag in help it to escap observ it is signific that
in england the butterfli observ appear to lean over more
frequent in sunshin than in shade an observ of mr e g
waddilov report by colonel longstaff is interest in thi
connect
a grayl settl on a patch of bare black peat earth shut up it
wing vertic and crawl at onc some two yard to the edg of
the patch to where some firneedl a cone or two and a few brittl
twig were ly and then becom stationari threw itself over at an
angl of some fortyf degre squar to the sun it thu becam
quit indistinguish from it surround
appar some of the anglew mai have the same habit for in
barrett lepidoptera of the british island there is a note in
regard to grapta calbum to the effect that it is fond of sun

shelter vallei here if the sun becom overcloud it will
sometim close it wing and almost lie down in such a manner that
to distinguish it brown and green marbl under side from the dead
leav is almost imposs
here is a most fascin opportun for american observ to
determin definit the fact in regard to our numer speci of
butterfli that mai show thi habit an observ with a reflex type
of camera might easili be abl to get pictur that would be of great
valu in help to determin the princip fact in regard to the
subject our common grayl and numer speci of anglew ar
so abund and easili observ that thei offer splendid opportun
to ani on who will undertak a seriou studi of the subject
parasit enemi
all three of the earlier stage of butterfliesegg larva and
chrysalisar subject to attack by variou parasit insect which
develop at the expens of the host such parasit ar probabl the
most import check upon the increas of butterfli and along with
bird mammal and bacteri diseas thei help to keep up that
balanc of natur which in the long run maintain a surpris
uniform in the number of each kind of butterfli
for the most part these insect parasit ar small fourwing fli
although mani of them ar twowing fli in either case the life
stage show a seri of chang much like those of the butterfli
themselv each parasit exist first as an egg second as a larva
third as a pupa and fourth as an adult fly the larval stage
howev is simpli that of a footless grub which live within the bodi
of it victim absorb it life blood and gradual kill it
the parasit of butterfli egg ar legion thei ar tini fli whose
lifestori in briefest summari is thi the butterfli lai an egg the
parasit fly find thi egg soon after it is laid and pierc the
shell with her tini sharpli point ovipositor and deposit insid of
the shell her own microscop egg thi egg within the egg soon
hatch into a curiou littl larva that develop at the expens of
the content of the butterfli egg shell and soon absorb the whole
of them the parasit larva now chang to a pupa which a littl later
chang again to an adult fly like the on that laid the parasit egg
in the begin of cours the butterfli egg never hatch into a
caterpillar
on of the most interest question in regard to these egg parasit
is thi how doe the tini parasit fly find the newli laid egg on
would think that the proverbi search for a needl in a haymow would
be an easi task compar with that of a fly about as larg as the head
of a pin find a butterfli egg of similar size upon some part of on
of the million of leav upon the tree and shrub in field and
forest yet the search is success as everi on who ha tri to
get caterpillar from egg found out of door will testifi on a later
page in thi book in connect with the stori of the life of the
mourn cloak butterfli i have record some observ upon the
littl parasit which seem to have been ride around upon the bodi
of the butterfli wait for her to lai her egg
for on parasit upon the egg of butterfli there probabl ar
dozen that attack the caterpillar a larg proport of the
butterfli larva brought in from outdoor especi those which ar
halfgrown or more will yield not butterfli but parasit thi is
the experi of practic everi on who attempt to rear these
insect and it emphas the valu of the advic that in order to
get fine specimen it is desir to rear them from egg laid by
butterfli beneath net or in cage
the lifehistori of the parasit that attack caterpillar vari
greatli the simplest ar those of the larg ichneumon fli the
mother fly lai an egg beneath the skin of the caterpillar the egg
hatch into a larva that absorb the fatti part of the bodi of the
caterpillar gradual grow larger and larger until at last it
reach a length of possibl an inch by thi time it is like to
have absorb so larg a part of the insid of the caterpillar that
the latter di the parasit larva now chang to a pupa either
insid or outsid the skin of the caterpillar and a littl later
chang again to an adult ichneumon fly
illustr tachinid parasit a fly b puparium
magnifi
in the case just given on egg onli wa deposit within the skin of
the caterpillar in mani other howev a larg number of egg mai
be so deposit by a singl fly a special group of ichneumon fli
call the microgast contain mani parasit that have thi
peculiar the microgast larva on come forth from the
caterpillar have the habit of spin tini cocoon within which thei
chang to pupa by collect some cabbag worm which ar nearli
full grown and keep them in a glass jar on can gener get a
consider number of these microgast cocoon and rear the fli
from them
anoth group of caterpillar parasit is still more minut thei ar
call the chalcid fli their lifehistori ar full of interest
and might easili furnish opportun for a long lifetim of studi and
experi on is like to get hundr of these chalcid fli from
a singl caterpillar
anoth interest group of parasit is that of the twowing
tachina fli see cut on thi page the lifestori of some of
these is compar simpl a buzz fly look much like a
larg housefli lai a small whitish egg upon the skin of a
caterpillar thi egg is glu tightli and is larg enough to be
readili seen by the unaid ey it hatch into a tini larva that
eat it wai through the part of the shell glu to the caterpillar
skin and through the latter at the same time so the newli hatch
tachina larva find itself in the bodi of it caterpillar host it
live there absorb the fatti juic around it until at last it
either kill or stupefi it unfortun victim it ha then becom
full grown as a larva and it last larval skin harden into a brown
pupacas within which the littl creatur chang into a pupa it mai
or mai not have burrow through the skin of the caterpillar befor
thi happen a littl later the pupa chang to a tachina fly which
break apart the pupacas and fli out into the world
it ha late been found howev that mani tachinid have much more
complic lifehistori than thi i have alreadi discuss some of
the more import of these in my book entitl see natur first
page 150158
on can frequent rear parasit from the chrysalid of butterfli
but in mani case it is probabl that these began their parasit
develop in the caterpillar which were abl to chang to
chrysalid befor be kill in some case howev the chrysalid
seem to be attack especi by certain ichneumon fli
rear butterfli from caterpillar
there ar few thing in the world more interest to watch than the
wonder chang which a moth or butterfli goe through in the
cours of it life you find on a tree or shrub a wormlik
caterpillar you take it in charg place it in a box or jar where
you can provid leav for it food and soon it either spin around
itself a silken shroud thu hide from your sight or els it simpli
seem to chang to a lifeless object without ey or wing or leg
unabl to move about and motionless save for a slight wriggl when
you touch it yet if you keep the shroud or the mummylik object for
two or three week you ar like to see a beauti moth come from
the shroud or a gloriou butterfli break out of the mummi case see
plate page 49 so you can get the realest kind of move pictur
by simpli bring in the caterpillar that ar easili found in
garden field and wood
to collect these caterpillar it is onli necessari to be provid with
a pair of sharp ey and an empti coffe can or some other form of tin
box go out into the garden or along the border of the wood look
carefulli if you see place where leav have been eaten search the
leav near by and you ar like to find on or more of the
caterpillar that caus the injuri transfer them to the box and take
them home with a few leav of the food plant there place them in
some form of vivarium which simpli mean a box or cage in which you
can keep live creatur
the most satisfactori cage for rear caterpillar ar those which
ar open abov so that there is not even a glass plate between the
observ and the insect thi kind of vivarium is easili made by us
a band of some sticki substanc like the tree tanglefoot with which
tree ar commonli band or a strip of sticki fly paper ani wide
shallow box mai be us by simpli place an inchwid band of the
sticki materi around the vertic side near the top the
caterpillar will be free to move all over the open box but thei
cannot cross the band to escap fresh leav ar easili place in the
open box and the wither on remov
the same plan mai be adopt with wide glass jar like the ordinari
batteri jar choos a rather larg on and smear the inner side near
the top with a band of sticki materi the caterpillar ar thu
prevent from crawl out but thei ar open to observ at all
time see plate page 4849
in the case of the caterpillar that chang to butterfli no soil
need be place in the bottom of the jar as these will attach their
chrysalid to the side or to a stick or board which mai easili be put
in in the case of mani caterpillar that chang to moth howev it
is desir to place about two inch of soil in the bottom of the
jar then if the caterpillar ar not cocoon spinner thei can burrow
into the soil when thei ar readi to chang to pupa
instead of appli the sticki materi directli to the glass a strip
of sticki fly paper mai be glu to it
as a rule the butterfli caterpillar easiest to find live upon
cabbag go into the garden and you ar like to see a dozen green
caterpillar upon as mani cabbag plant bring in sever of the
larger on and place them in a vivarium with some fresh cabbag
leav in a few dai some of them will be like to fasten themselv
to the vertic side of the vivarium and shed the caterpillar skin
each thu becom a chrysali about ten dai later thi chrysali
skin will break open and a white cabbag butterfli will come out
so your caterpillar goe through the four differ stage of insect
life it wa first an egg laid upon the leaf by a butterfli the egg
hatch into the caterpillar or larva the larva chang to the
chrysali the chrysali chang to the butterfli or adult insect
on of the most satisfactori wai to rear the caterpillar of
butterfli is to get the femal to lai their egg upon the food
plant in the case of mani speci thi is not difficult the simplest
wai is to enclos the mother butterfli in a small gauz bag ti over
the branch of the food plant if she ha egg readi to deposit she is
veri like to lai them under these condit after thei ar laid
the mother butterfli mai be allow to escap but it is well to
replac the gauz protect as a safeguard against mani sort of
enemi which mai destroi the egg or the young caterpillar that
hatch from them anoth wai is to enclos the butterfli with a twig
of the food plant in a glass jar seal it tight to prevent the
leav from wilt the butterfli is like after she ha quiet
down to lai her egg upon the leav accord to william g wright
who speak from hi long experi with the butterfli of the west
coast these genera will lai their egg on anyth parnassiu
argynni euptoieta neonympha and all member of the famili
satyrida in these case on can get the egg by simpli enclos the
butterfli in glass jar or gauz net without even the leav of the
food plant william h edward found in hi long experi that on
can get the egg of practic all butterfli in confin
provid onli the insect ar suffici matur so that the egg ar
readi to be laid he found that the caus of failur to get egg from
mani of the fritillari earli in the season wa that the egg were
not matur and that from the same kind of butterfli with which he
fail earli in the summer he got plenti of egg in septemb
there is here a rich field for observ and experi for everi
naturalist who wish to take up the studi of butterfli he can be
sure of the parentag of the caterpillar and can trace them from the
veri moment of egglai through all their wonder chang until
thei becom butterfli again
photograph butterfli
there is a famou old sai that to make hare stew it is first
necessari to catch your hare so if on wish to make perfect
pictur of butterfli it is first necessari to get the caterpillar
for though caterpillar ar not butterfli thei ar butterfli in
the make and thei will show you most interest stage in natur
manufactur of these dainti and exquisit creatur thi is not
howev the chief reason why the photograph should get them he
will wish to make perfect pictur and in order to do thi he must
have not onli perfect specimen but live butterfli which ar
will to look pleasant while he make compar long exposur
under condit of light that he can control if you catch a
butterfli outdoor and bring it in you will be like to find that it
is by no mean a docil subject the sunlight shine through the
nearest window will be a call which you cannot counteract and your
butterfli will constantli respond to it in a most vex manner so
you must catch the butterfli young and take advantag of a brief but
docil period in their live when thei ar will to pose befor your
camera in quit a remark manner thi is the period just after
the butterfli emerg from the chrysali when it wing ar fulli
develop but befor the tissu have harden and the muscl in the
thorax ar strong enough for flight at thi time the butterfli is
perfect everi scale is in it place and everi spot of color is at it
best and it will rest quietli upon a flower leaf or twig while you
adjust the camera and expos the plate from on such specimen on can
get mani pictur upon differ flower and with differ angl of
view see plate page 160 225
in order to make admir photograph of live butterfli it is by
no mean necessari to have a regular photograph studio if on ha a
room light from the north or east on can arrang for exposur near
the window us cardboard reflector to make the light more even
from both side in such a situat on soon learn the exposur
period requir and can easili get mani beauti photograph
a collect of print of the butterfli of on local would be
on of the most interest photograph exhibit that an amateur
could select it is compar easi to get rather full set show
the lifehistori of sever of our larger speci and such set ar
of cours of especi interest in the case of those caterpillar
which make nest upon the food plant like the paint beauti larva
which remain for week feed upon the leav of the common wild
everlast the take of the pictur of the differ stage is
compar easi on can keep the plant with the stem in water and
get the caterpillar to chang to the chrysali and emerg as the

butterfli collect
there ar few group in natur which offer such advantag to the
collector as that of the butterfli thei ar easili obtain easili
preserv and retain their beauti for a long period even under
exposur to strong light thei offer opportun for seriou studi
in which on cannot onli review the fact which other have alreadi
discov but also hope to contribut someth of valu to the sum
of human knowledg
the mistak most commonli made by beginn with butterfli as with
other collect is to undertak too much instead of start on
the hopeless task of make a collect of the butterfli of the
world it is much better to start with the intent of make a
collect of those of on own town in the latter case on can hope
soon to attain the desir end and then if on wish it is a simpl
matter to reach out and make a collect of the butterfli of the
state or even of the particular region in which the state is locat
the natur limit for a collect in new england is to make a
collect of new england butterfli there is a splendid exampl of
such a collect on exhibit in the museum of the boston societi of
natur histori thi contain repres of practic everi
kind that ha been collect in new england and yet there ar less
than a hundr speci in all so it is appar that a local
collect should be attain by ani enthusiast student and the
veri fact that the number of speci is limit add interest and
satisfact to the pursuit
the main valu of ani collect of object li in the point of view
of the collector the most natur point of view for a beginn is
that of the local fauna as indic in the previou paragraph such
a collect best serv as a basi for a studi of the subject but it
mai well lead to a broader field through some special phase of
scientif interest thu while it would be hopeless for most person
to attempt a collect of the butterfli of the world it would be
entir reason for on to start a collect of all the speci
in the world of ani given genu or tribe and such a set of specimen
would soon come to possess decid scientif valu or instead of
the point of view of gener or famili relationship on could take
the point of view of special geograph distribut thu a
collect of all the butterfli found within a certain number of
degre of the north pole show the circumpolar butterfli fauna
would have great scientif interest
there ar also variou other point of view which could be follow in
make a collect there ar alreadi in mani of the museum of the
world collect of butterfli which illustr the variou phase
of true mimicryth resembl of on speci to anoth in the same
region thi is a field in which on could spend a lifetim of
endeavor and secur result of great valu to the world of scienc
an easier problem for most collector in the unit state would be a
collect made from the point of view of resembl to environ
includ such exampl as the anglew that show a barklik set
of mark on the under surfac yet anoth point of view would be that
of hibern the make of a collect of all butterfli that
hibern as adult
these ar onli a few suggest there ar mani other phase of
butterfli life which could be util as the basi for interest
collect the import thing is to have a definit object in view
and to make the collect a basi for a real studi of the subject so
that the collector will not onli be grow intellectu but will
also be make a real contribut to our scientif knowledg
collect apparatu
to collect and preserv butterfli in proper condit for studi
certain apparatu is necessari perhap the first essenti is the
collect net for catch butterfli in the field the simplest wai
to obtain thi is to bui it of the dealer in entomolog suppli
net in consider varieti and at variou price ar offer in the
catalogu of these firm on can make howev a net at home with
littl difficulti on need onli obtain an iron wire about on fifth
of an inch in diamet and bend it into a circular ring a foot or
fifteen inch wide leav the end project at right angl to
the circl and have a blacksmith weld them togeth so as to form a
spur about four inch long now thrust thi spur into some conveni
handl such as a broomstick and sew over the wire circl a bag of
mosquito net swiss muslin or some similar fabric it is better
that thi materi be green or black rather than white
after the butterfli ar caught thei must be kill so some form of
kill bottl is necessari most collector us a cyanid bottl in
which the fume of cyanid of potassium kill the insect on of the
best wai to make thi is to place in a widemouth bottl two or
three lump of cyanid of potassium approxim an inch across
over thi place some fine sawdust and on top of the sawdust pour
liquid plaster of pari carefulli so that it will harden into a layer
about half an inch thick allow the plaster to becom thoroughli dry
then insert the stopper into the bottl and it will be readi for us
it is better to us a ground glass stopper so that the bottl will
alwai be air tight the sawdust is often omit the plaster of
pari be pour directli over the cyanid the special advantag of
the sawdust is that it tend to absorb the cyanid in case it
liquefi as it often doe in damp weather as thi cyanid is a
deadli poison it is better to let a druggist prepar the bottl or
els to bui it alreadi prepar of the dealer in such suppli
illustr butterfli envelop fold first on line ab
then on ad and cb then on bf and ea from holland
after the specimen have been kill in the cyanid bottl some
method of keep them is necessari the simplest wai is to preserv
them with their wing close togeth in piec of paper fold over
into triangl as indic on the accompani diagram such
specimen mai be kept for an indefinit time and if on wish to
mount them later it is onli necessari to place them for a few hour
in a relax jar which is simpli a close vessel with enough water
in the bottom to satur the air with moistur a great advantag of
keep the specimen in these paper cover is that thei requir so
littl room and ar easili store awai in tin can or box where thei
ar safe from dust and destroi enemi
illustr set board with butterfli in place
from holland
those butterfli which ar to be preserv in the ordinari wai in
drawer or cabinet must be spread out and held in posit while the
bodi is dry so that the wing will remain expand for thi
purpos some form of a set board is necessari these mai be
bought of dealer or made at home on of the simplest kind consist
of two thin strip of pine board a foot or more long nail to end
piec with a space between the two board wide enough to accommod
the bodi of the butterfli beneath thi open space a piec of
thin cork is tack the pin on which the butterfli is fasten is
push through the cork until the wing of the insect ar level with
the board the wing ar then brought forward with a needl point
until thei ar in the desir posit and thei ar then held in place
by piec of glass or by bit of cardboard fasten down by pin the
butterfli must be left in thi posit until thoroughli dry

entomolog dealer instead of pin the insect and preserv
them in cabinet on mai keep them in the riker mount which have
the advantag of be seal so that there is no chanc for dust or
museum pest to reach the specimen if on wish to collect
extens on will need a consider number of set board and
it will be worth while to prepar for them a special dry box like

the true butterfli
superfamili papilionoidea
the great subord of butterfli is commonli separ into two
princip group call superfamili on of these includ all of
the higher butterfli and is name papilionoidea the other
includ the lower skipper butterfli and is name the
hesperioidea the former ar character by small bodi and
rel larg wing straight club antenna and the fact that
the caterpillar do not make cocoon when prepar for the chrysali
state
the most authorit classif of butterfli famili ar base
upon the peculiar of wing venat and ar admir discuss in
such book as holland butterfli book and comstock how to know
the butterfli without attempt to go into the technic detail
of structur it will suffic here to give the list of famili which
compos the superfamili papilionoidea
the parnassian parnassiida
the swallowtail papilionida
the white orangetip and yellow pierida
the nymph nymphalida
the satyr or meadowbrown agapetida
the heliconian heliconida
the milkwe butterfli lymnadida
the longbeak libytheida
the metalmark riodinida
the gossamerw lycaenida
it must not be thought that such a list necessarili indic the
degre of develop of the respect famili for thi is not
true it is simpli a linear arrang adopt for conveni by
lead author notabl dr harrison g dyar in hi standard
catalog of american lepidoptera
the parnassian butterfli
famili parnassiida
it is perhap a bit unfortun that the group of butterfli which
is commonli chosen to head the list of famili is on that is rare
seen by most collector the parnassian ar butterfli of the far
north or of high elev in the mountain the four speci
credit to north america have been collect in alaska and the higher
elev of the rocki mountain so there is veri littl probabl
of ani of them be found in the eastern state
while structur these butterfli have a close affin with the
swallowtail on would never suspect it from their gener
appear their bodi ar larg and all of the wing well round
so that there is more of the suggest of a larg moth than of the
swallowtail the color is also more mothlik than with most
butterfli the wing be veri light color and nearli
transpar with mark of grai and brown arrang in dot and
splash
all our speci belong to the genu parnassiu the caterpillar show
their affin with those of the swallowtail by have the curiou
scent organ or osmateria just back of the head thei feed upon such
alpin plant as stonecrop and saxifrag and ar well adapt by their
structur and habit to the bleak surround of the mountain top
as a typic exampl of the environ in which these butterfli
live we mai take the alpin vallei of such mountain region as
pike peak prof m j elrod ha describ a visit where at an
altitud of 11500 feet in the month of august parnassiu smintheu
wa fly by thousand and the earlier stage were so abund that
a water ditch had the surfac cover as far as on could see with the
dead or dy caterpillar in such situat where ic form at
night and snow frequent fall by dai these butterfli develop
appar in greater number than almost ani of our other speci ar
known to do in warmer region
the swallowtail
famili papilionida
thi is probabl the most distinct famili of all our familiar
butterfli it member ar character by be on the whole the
largest butterfli in our region and by have the hind wing
prolong into curiou taillik project suggest of those of a
swallow in gener the basal color of the wing is blackish though
thi is commonli mark in variou strike wai with yellow green
or blue while the margin of the wing ar commonli adorn with red
or orang spot these butterfli ar also character by certain
peculiar in the branch of the wing vein which will be found
pictur in more technic work
the caterpillar of these butterfli have the characterist form
pictur on the plate of the swallowtail opposit page 80 when
full grown thei ar larg fairli smoothbodi worm show at most
on the surfac spars fine hair or fleshi threadlik project
their most characterist featur is found in the scent organ call
osmateria situat in the back just behind the head these ar
thrust out gener when the caterpillar is disturb and appear as
orang y or vshape organ from which an offens odor is commonli
given off thei ar suppos to serv the purpos of prevent injuri
by enemi possibl bird monkei and other vertebr
structur thei ar like long tubular pocket that can be turn
insid out when the pocket is in place it is get a pocket of
odor when it is invert it let these odor free on thi account
professor comstock ha aptli call these caterpillar the polecat
of the insect world
when readi to pupat these papilio caterpillar spin a web of silk
upon some more or less flatten surfac and a loop of silk near by
thei entangl their hind leg in the former and keep their head
through the latter so the loop support the bodi a littl behind the
head then thei chang to chrysalid which ar held in place by these
set of silken thread
the chrysalid ar rather larg and angular and gener take on
color approxim their surround thei vari so much in
differ speci that on familiar with them can recogn the
chrysali and know the kind of butterfli it will produc
the black swallowtail
papilio polyxen
while the black swallowtail is not so larg as some other member of
the group it is probabl the best known to most peopl it is found
throughout mani month of the year in practic all part of north
america south of canada and ha the habit of fly freeli about
field and garden in search of flower from which to suck it nectar
food and of plant on which to deposit it egg the femal
butterfli have a remark abil in select onli member of the
great famili umbellifera for thi purpos in consequ the
caterpillar ar gener to be found feed upon carrot parsnip
parslei and variou wild speci belong to thi order see
plate page 48 and 6465
the egg of the black swallowtail ar laid on in a place upon the
leav of the food plant each egg is a small yellowish smooth and
ovoid object it mai often be found by watch the butterfli as
thei fly low in search of umbellifer plant and see on stop
for a minut or so while she lai the egg
about ten dai after the egg is laid it hatch into a small black
caterpillar mark in a characterist fashion with a blotch of white
in the middl of the bodi which is suggest of a saddl the
caterpillar immedi begin to feed upon the green substanc of the
leaf continu thu about a week befor the first moult at thi
time it doe not chang much in appear still be a spini
creatur blackish in color and mark by the curiou white saddl a
littl later it moult again retain it origin color at each
moult of cours it get larger and feed more freeli upon the celeri
or other plant on which it mai happen to be
when the caterpillar becom about half grown it take on a veri
differ appear from that of it earli life the skin is smooth
rather than spini and the gener color ar green black and
yellow the ground color of the skin is green which is mark with
black crossband along the middl of each bodi ring on these band
there ar mani larg dot of orang yellow the whole color give
the insect a veri strike appear especi when it is place by
itself against a plain background when thei final becom full grown
in thi larva state these caterpillar ar almost two inch long
the larva of the black swallowtail have certain characterist in
which thei differ from mani other caterpillar after each moult thei
do not devour their cast skin which happen in the case of mani of
their rel when feed as well as when rest thei remain
expos upon the leaf and seem never to attempt to conceal themselv
as is the habit with a larg proport of caterpillar it is
probabl that thi instinct for remain expos to view bear some
relat to the curiou mean of protect possess by thi as well
as other swallowtail caterpillar when disturb on of these larva
will push out from just back of the head the strangelook
orangeyellow yshape organ which give off a veri disagre odor
these osmateria organ ar gener believ to be defens against
the attack of bird and variou other enemi although thei seem not
to be effect against insect parasit
the fullgrown caterpillar ar like to leav their food plant when
readi to chang to the chrysali state thei wander in variou
direct until suitabl shelter is found a piec of board a fenc
post or possibl the bark of a tree will answer for thi purpos
here the caterpillar spin a mat of silk in which to entangl it hind
leg and a short distanc awai near the front end of the bodi it spin
a loop of silk attach the end to the support these serv to hold
the chrysali in place dure thi helpless period after the loop is
made the caterpillar keep it head through it so that the loop hold
the insect in posit a short distanc back of the head it is now
readi to moult it last caterpillar skin and becom a chrysali
on who ha watch hundr of these caterpillar go through thi
chang miss mari c dickerson describ the process in these word
in thi final moult the chrysali ha to work veri hard the bulk of
the bodi is again slip forward in the loosen caterpillar skin so
that thi becom tens stretch over the anterior end and veri
much wrinkl at the posterior end the skin split back of the head
and is forc back by it own taut condit and by the effort of the
chrysali until onli the extrem posterior end of the chrysali is
within it then the chrysali withdraw thi posterior end with it
mani veri tini hook from the skin on the dorsal side and reach
around secur fasten the hook into the button of silk then the
old skin is remov both from it fasten to the chrysali and from
it attach in the button of silk
a short time after the caterpillar skin ha thu been cast off the
chrysali take on a brownish color which as is so often the case is
like to vari somewhat accord to the tint of the surround
surfac thi is doubtless a protect devic and help the insect
to escap attack by bird dure the long period of exposur for thi
butterfli pass through the winter onli in the chrysali condit
and the larva which went into the chrysali in septemb doe not come
out as a butterfli until the follow mai or june there ar
howev two brood of the butterfli in the north and at least three
in the south as the adult live for about two month and there is
consider variat in the period of their develop it happen
that on can find these black swallowtail butterfli upon the wing
almost ani time in warm weather either north or south
the giant swallowtail
papilio thoa
the largest of our north american butterfli is a magnific insect
with a wing expans of some four inch and with a rich color of
black and yellow more or less suffus with greenish or bluish
iridesc that give it a strike beauti as it fli leisur
about from flower to flower or stop to lai an egg upon some bush or
tree the tail ar long and expand toward the tip their prevail
color be black with a broad splash of yellow near the end in a
gener wai we mai sai that the upper wing surfac is black mark
with two band of orangeyellow while the under surfac is yellow
mark with two band of black see plate page 64
the giant swallowtail is a tropic speci which is abund
throughout the southern state and dure recent year seem to have
been gradual extend it northern rang it is now commonli found
as far north as fortytwo degre latitud from nebraska eastward in
new england it is occasion taken in connecticut massachusett
and even in main but it appear in thi region is except
in the orangegrow region of the southern state the caterpillar
of thi butterfli feed freeli upon the leav of citru fruit and
thei ar often call orang puppi or orang dog probabl
their curiou appear and their habit of rest for long period
upon leaf or twig gave rise to thi name in the region indic the
lifehistori of the insect mai be summar thu
the mother butterfli deposit the egg singli upon the young growth of
orang or other citru fruit tree gener near the tip of leav
or branch about a week later each egg hatch into a caterpillar
that feed upon the young leav rest upon the lower surfac when
not eat after a few dai of thi feed the caterpillar becom
too larg for the skin with which it wa born and it moult come
forth with a new skin which soon harden so that it can begin feed
again a week or so later it moult for the second time and continu
these process of feed and moult until full grown which is
perhap a month from the time of hatch from the egg at first the
caterpillar eat onli the succul young leav and branch but as
thei grow larger thei feed more freeli upon the older foliag thei
ar veri voraci and when abund mai often do much damag
especi to young tree when readi to chang to the chrysali each
caterpillar attach itself by silken thread to the bark of the
trunk or branch of the tree here it chang to a chrysali which
take on a color so similar to that of the bark that the insect is
surprisingli difficult to discov a fortnight or so later it chang
again into a fulli develop butterfli that salli forth in search of
the nectar of flower see plate page 240
these orang dog like the caterpillar of other swallowtail
butterfli have curiou yellow scent organ which when the
caterpillar is disturb protrud from the upper surfac just behind
the head these give forth a veri disagre odor which is believ
to serv the purpos of repel bird and possibl other enemi it
ha been notic that these caterpillar ar not molest by bird
although thei ar attack by variou insect enemi each mother
butterfli is known to be abl to deposit four or five hundr egg and
it ha been suggest that the injuri of the caterpillar mai be
check by shoot the butterfli upon the wing with cartridg load
with small bird shot in the south there ar sever brood in a
season
the lifehistori of thi speci in more northern region differ in
the choic of the food plant and the number of brood it feed upon
variou member of the rue famili includ common rue and prickli
ash as well as upon certain poplar and probabl other tree it is
two brood and appar winter as a chrysali the butterfli of
the first brood come from the chrysali about the last of mai and ar
found on the wing dure june those of the second brood come from the
chrysali about the last of juli and ar found on the wing dure
august and septemb the length of time requir from the lai of
the egg to the emerg of the butterfli vari greatli with the
local and the temperatur it commonli extend over a period of
four or five week

the blue swallowtail is said to have closer affin with the splendid

there is a row of about five rather indistinct whitish spot thi row
be continu more distinctli on the hind wing on the under

probabl the commonest food plant of the caterpillar is the
dutchman pipe or aristolochia which is frequent plant as an
ornament vine for porch adorn it also feed upon wild ginger or
asarum and probabl upon other plant a dozen or more egg ar laid
upon a leaf by the mother butterfli usual in a cluster or group
near togeth thei hatch a week or so later into small brownish
caterpillar which remain togeth for awhil in littl group that
feed side by side upon the leaf begin at the margin and work
toward the centr as thei becom larger thei feed more freeli and
gradual dispers so that each forag for himself as thei approach
matur their appetit becom voraci and their presenc is often
shown by the defoli condit of the branch thei have back of
the head the osmateria or scent organ which ar commonli found in

and some of them ar believ to chang into butterfli in autumn
these butterfli hibern through the winter while other ar
believ to remain unchang through the winter and disclos the

the greencloud swallowtail
papilio troilu
thi beauti butterfli is essenti a southern speci and is
found over a wide rang of territori from the mississippi river to the
atlant ocean it occur as far north as new hampshir and vermont
and ha even been report from alberta canada it is easili
recogn by the bluegreen cloud of the upper surfac of the
wing the gener color be velveti black with distinct row of
yellow spot along the margin of the front wing these spot ar
present also on the hind wing where thei ar almost chang to blue
becaus overlaid with a gener cloudi of thi color on the under

the inner row be nearli crescentshap and the outer row oblong
in the live insect the tail project on the hind wing ar
usual twist into a vertic plane at right angl to the plane of
the wing
the caterpillar of thi speci feed upon the leav of sassafra and
spice bush the distribut of the butterfli appear to be close
relat to the distribut of these plant
as is the case with so mani of our swallowtail butterfli the
greencloud swallowtail pass through the winter in the chrysali
stage late in spring the butterfli emerg and soon afterward lai
their egg singli upon the leav of sassafra or spice bush the egg
soon hatch into leadcolor caterpillar larg cover with spini
wart each caterpillar cleverli make a protect nest by eat out
a narrow strip in the leaf which free a flap along the margin that is
turn back upon the leaf make a case in which the larva live it
spin a silken carpet on on side of the case and rest upon thi
carpet when at home dure it feed period it goe outsid and
eat the tissu of the other part of the same leaf it continu to
occupi thi first nest for a week or more by which time the rest of
the leaf is like to be pretti well consum
have pass the first moult and thu becom larger and have
practic eaten itself out of it first hous and home the
caterpillar now crawl to a larger leaf where it proce to make a
more endur structur in thi case it doe not need to bite a
channel along on side of the midrib as it did befor but instead it
begin to spin silken thread transvers across the upper surfac in
such a wai as to fold over the border of the leaf and make a tubular
chamber in which it ha plenti of room to move about it us thi as
it home for some time thereaft wander out at even to feed
upon neighbor leav as it hunger necessit in thi wai it
continu to feed and grow for a week or two then it find it
necessari to construct still anoth home which it doe by bring
togeth the opposit side of a leaf take care to have a doorlik
open at the base of the blade next the leaf stalk thi third home
serv it to the end of it larval exist it goe in and out as
necessari remain conceal when it cast it skin and until the
bodi tissu harden afterward appar it devour the cast skin and
thrust the hard cover of the head out of the nest consequ
these littl home ar clean and sanitari and serv admir their

and there ar six row of blue dot along the bodi see plate
page 80
when readi to chang to the chrysali the caterpillar desert their
leafi home and on a twig or board or stone each spin a bit of silken
web and a silken loop thei now chang to chrysalid which ar
like to resembl the color of the background and which ar somewhat
smoother than mani of the swallowtail chrysalid about two week
later the butterfli emerg
the eclos of the butterfli
the transform of a chrysali into a butterfli is alwai on of
extraordinari interest compar few definit descript of
thi process have been given by care observ on of the best of
these is that written by mr scudder in connect with the emerg
of thi butterfli and it is so accur and complet that it seem
worth while to quot it at length
the butterfli gener emerg from the chrysali earli in the dai
write mr scudder and the first sign of the immedi chang ar
strong forward and backward movement of the chrysali at interv of
a few second perhap the third or fourth attempt will be success
when a click mai be heard at the distanc of sever feet but all the
subsequ movement ar absolut noiseless though rapid at
interv of three or four second spasmod movement similar to the
first carri on the process first the split continu along the
thorax then it run down either side between the leg and wing
ultim to the tip of the antenna as thi progress the
action becom more strenuou and more frequent repeat with eager
effort the butterfli push forward it halfdetach head now an
antenna spring from it case at onc assum it natur attitud
the other soon follow and then the wing ar partial drawn from
their sheath and while in thi posit seem to be us as lever or
arm to aid in withdraw the rest of the bodi next the leg appear
seiz the upper part of the chrysali skin and speedili withdraw the
whole bodi it is now a curiouslook object the wing wrinkl
and bloat and although the whole process of escap last littl
more than half a minut alreadi twice the size of the sheath thei
late occupi the insect crawl upward until it find a secur
rest place and there remain until readi for flight each half of
the tongu drawn independ from it receptacl is roll in a
separ spiral and now while the wing ar gradual expand the
insect appli all it energi to unit their two part
incessantli roll and unrol them and begin simultan at
the base gradual fit them togeth by their interlock joint
in about fifteen minut all but the tip ar perfectli unit these
requir nearli fifteen minut more and ar not fairli interlock
until the wing ar fulli expand nearli a full half hour after the
escap from the chrysali the wing howev ar still tender and
gener requir two hour to stiffen when at last the insect
ventur upon flight it is not with an uncertain flutter but boldli
and steadili as if long accustom to the action
the butterfli of thi second brood of the season ar like to begin
to appear earli in august continu to becom more abund
throughout that month these lai egg upon the same food plant and the
caterpillar grow to matur in the same wai as those of the first
brood thei becom full grown dure septemb or octob and then
chang to chrysalid which remain dormant until the follow spring
the speci thu ha two brood each year and pass the winter onli
in the chrysali state
these beauti butterfli ar like to be found in the sort of
situat where the food plant of the larva ar grow open
grove the border of wood and the margin of stream or marsh
ar the place where on is most like to find spice bush and
sassafra these ar the place to look for these butterfli which
on mai often see in grace flight near the ground paus now and
then to seek a sassafra leaf or to sip the nectar from a flower
the tiger swallowtail
papilio glaucu
on of the mani thing that make a studi of the lifehistori of
butterfli of great interest is the variat in the develop of
mani of the speci on who follow the simplest lifestori of a
butterfli and see the egg chang to larva and the larva chang in
size and form and color with each success moult and then chang
again into the seemingli inert chrysali from which there final
come the wing butterflyunlik the egg unlik the larva unlik
the chrysalisa creatur of perfect beauti wonderfulli adapt to
live freeli in the air and sip ambrosi nectar from the
flowerson who follow these chang with awaken vision can
scarc fail to have a sens of wonder as to the law that govern
such intric phenomena but the marvel is still more pronounc in
the case of those butterfli which have two or more form aris
from the same lot of egg in a wai which scienc ha as yet not
adequ explain
the splendid tiger swallowtail is an exampl of thi dimorph which
is of especi interest becaus of the fact that the extra form is
confin to on sex and to onli a part of the geograph area over
which the butterfli is found the speci occur over a veri larg
part of the north american contin be found from ocean to ocean
and from canada to florida in the region north of approxim the
fortieth degre of latitud there is but on form of the insectth
familiar yellowandblack stripe butterfli which everi on ha seen
visit the lilac blossom in mai or june south of thi howev
part of the femal take on an entir differ appear be
almost wholli black with the hind wing touch with line of blue and
border with crescent of yellow and orang the curiou thing about
it is that a certain mother butterfli mai lai a dozen egg part of
which will develop into the usual yellow form and the rest into the
black form both lot be of the same sex thi black form is so
entir distinct in appear that the two were origin describ
as separ speci and thei were long consid such until
breed experi determin the precis condit see plate
page 17
thi speci is of interest also for anoth reason the caterpillar
dure their later life ar remark exampl of that curiou
resembl to the head of a serpent which is thought to have a real
protect valu in frighten awai attack bird and possibl
other enemi the ring of the bodi just back of the head ar much
swollen and on the top of the swollen part there ar two larg
circular mark which bear a strike resembl to ey when the
insect is at rest it withdraw it head and hold up the front of the
bodi in such a wai as certainli to suggest at the first glanc that
on is look at the head of a small snake an impress which is
like to be enhanc when the caterpillar push out the curiou
yellow scent organ from the ring near the top of the head these
organ take on the fork appear of a snake tongu
obvious it is exceedingli difficult to get definit observ
under natur condit to determin whether these seem
resembl ar realli of valu to the caterpillar in frighten
awai bird or other enemi about the onli direct evid which i
have come across upon thi point is found in thi paragraph by dr j

when i recal the first sight of thi larva the impress gain of
it wa a most curiou on the forward masklik face wa remark
startl thi mask bear eyelik spot and the light transvers
ridg gave it an aspect which might easili be mistaken for real ey
and a mouth thi contriv is onli a fals face in no wai connect
with the real ey and mouth on might imagin the shock that a bird
or other predac enemi would experi when look upon thi

the yearli cycl of the tiger swallowtail is much like that of the
relat speci it pass the winter as a chrysali the butterfli
come forth just about the time that the lilac bloom thei remain
upon the wing for a few week and deposit their egg upon a great
varieti of tree and shrub for the food plant of the larva ar
unusu vari and includ tulip tree birch wild cherri
appl poplar ash and sever other common tree or shrub these
egg soon hatch into caterpillar that feed upon the leav and make
for themselv rest place by spin a web of silk transvers
across the surfac of the leaf thei remain upon these silken web
when not feed and in later life ar like to caus the leaf on
which the web is made to curl into a partial tube when fulli
develop thei chang to chrysalid which give forth the summer brood
of butterfli in juli and august these in turn lai egg for the

if the magician who had succeed in convert a black swallowtail
into the shorttail papilio wish to try hi hand on make a

larger retain practic all it color mark and the outlin
of it wing and tail for thi speci bear a remark resembl
to the black swallowtail seem to be a giant varieti induc by the
warmth of the southern climat where it live and possibl by the
more gener suppli of the magnolia and sassafra leav upon which
the caterpillar feed
thi speci is distinctli a southern form occur as far west as
the mississippi river throughout the more southern state as on
would expect in the long season and warm climat of thi region there
ar sever brood each year and the caterpillar often hibern as

tree
the zebra swallowtail
iphiclid ajax
most of our swallowtail butterfli ar so distinct in form and
color that thei ar easili distinguish from on anoth but the
zebra speci is so differ from all the rest that when it is onc
seen it is like alwai to be rememb the strike combin of
green and black stripe with veri long tail set off by beauti
crescent of blue and of red at onc distinguish thi fine
butterfli in ani of it vari form
three distinct form of thi speci occur name
marcellu the earli spring form small in size with short tail
that show white onli on the tip
telamonid the late spring form somewhat larger with tail a
littl longer and show more white on the outer half
ajax the summer form decidedli larger with tail veri long
it would be a compar simpl matter to understand these form if
thei were simpli season variat with three brood each form
succeed the other as the season advanc but thi is far from
be the case we have instead the most complic and confus
seri of condit imaginablecondit for which no on ha yet
given satisfactori explan
to make a fairli clear statement of what happen suppos we assum
that we start with twenti overwint chrysalid in april ten of
these disclos their butterfli which ar marcellu the earli spring
form in mai the other ten disclos their butterfli which ar
telamonid the late spring form we thu have these two form
appear success in spring from the same set of overwint
chrysalid
after fly about for a short time the marcellu or earli spring
swallowtail lai egg upon the leav of papaw tree or bush these
egg soon hatch into caterpillar that feed upon the leav and grow
rather rapidli a littl more than a month later thei matur into
butterfli which ar ajax the summer form
in a similar wai the telamonid or late spring butterfli lai egg
soon after thei appear also upon papaw leav and these egg in
about a month matur into ajax the summer form
so we have ajax the summer form develop directli from both the
earli spring or marcellu and the late spring or telamonid
butterfli
these ajax butterfli in their turn lai egg for caterpillar young
these soon matur into a brood of butterfli which ar of thi same
ajax form there mai be success brood through the summer
practic all of them be thi same ajax summer form
the last brood of caterpillar howev chang to chrysalid which do
not disclos the butterfli until the follow spring and then the
first that come out ar the marcellu form and the last the
telamonid form so we mai have these two form matur from the
same brood of autumn caterpillar
thi seem a suffici complic lifehistori to suit the most
persist solver of puzzl problem but there is an addit
factor which add much to the possibl confus of the brood in
each brood of caterpillar from the earliest to the latest there ar a
certain number of chrysalid which remain dormant through the
remaind of the season and the follow winter matur into
butterfli the next spring consequ at the end of everi winter
there ar a miscellan lot of chrysalid which repres everi
brood of caterpillar that live the previou season and all of these
develop into either marcellu or telamonid butterfli
such a condit of affair certainli repres what an old new

there is probabl no butterfli which on can gener find so easili
in it earli stage as the white or import cabbag butterfli which
is found practic wherev cabbag ar grown and is gener so
abund that caterpillar and chrysalid ar readili discov in
the northern state the insect pass through the winter within the
chrysali come forth rather earli in spring as the familiar white
butterfli with black dot upon the wing and blackish front angl of
the fore wing see plate page 6465 and 81
the butterfli that thu appear in spring flit freeli about over
field meadow and garden sip the nectar of variou earli
flower through their long coil tongu and stop occasion
to alight upon the leaf of a cabbag or other plant of the mustard
famili to deposit the small pale yellow egg which remain attach by
a sort of glue the adult butterfli continu their leisur life
for a fortnight or more thu extend the lai of the egg over a
consider period
about a week after be deposit the egg hatch into a tini green
caterpillar that begin feed upon the tender surfac of the cabbag
leaf it is commonli call the cabbag worm and it is doubtless the
most gener destruct insect affect thi crop it continu to
feed for sever dai befor the first moult after which it becom
decidedli larger and begin to eat again more voraci than befor
it undergo sever success moult dure the next two or three
week befor it becom full grown as a caterpillar unlik most
butterfli larva it ha chang veri littl in it gener appear
dure it growth it is alwai of a pale green color strikingli like
the glaucou green of the cabbag leaf a fact which doubtless help
to conceal it from the eager ey of bird and other anim
when the caterpillar is thu full fed it is like to leav it food
plant and find shelter elsewher sometim it will stop on the lower
surfac of the outer leav but more commonli it will find a piec of
board an overhang stone a fencepost or the side of a build
where it will prepar for the chang to the chrysali it will do thi
by spin a silken thread upon the surfac in which to entangl it
hind leg and a loop of silk near by with which to hold it bodi when
these prepar ar complet the insect will cast it last
caterpillar skin emerg as a grayish or brownish chrysali the
color usual vari with the color of the surround surfac
a week or more later the chrysali skin burst open and the white
butterfli emerg to expand and dry it wing befor it fli awai for
it leisur life there ar two or more brood each season the
number vari with the latitud there is a decid variat in the
length of time requir for the complet of the cycl from egg to
butterfli in hot weather the insect mai matur in about three week
while in cooler weather it mai requir as much as five week
it introduct and dispers
while it is well known that a larg proport of our most destruct
insect have been import from europ it is onli in compar
few case that man ha been abl to make care record of the time
and place where the insect were introduc and to follow the spread
of the pest from these origin centr the import cabbag
butterfli is on of the few speci of which thi is true thi insect
ha been known for centuri in europ where it feed freeli upon the
leav of cabbag and turnip so far as known it wa first
introduc into north america about 1860 when it appear in quebec
eight year later it wa again introduc into the region of new york
citi from these two point the insect spread gradual in variou
direct until in 1871 it cover the whole of new england and
variou part of new york and new jersei from then on it spread even
more rapidli and wa evid accident introduc into variou
part of the countri which becam new centr of distribut of
cours it would be veri easi for thi to happen through the shipment
of cabbag from on part of the countri to anoth within thirti
year of the time of it first introduct it had becom a seriou
pest over practic all the unit state and canada
the introduct and spread of such a pest is of interest in itself
but in thi case there is to be note the addit fact that the
presenc of thi foreign ha practic led to the extinct of
two nativ speci of butterfli both close relat to each other
and to the invad and both feed upon the same plant an almost
pure white butterflyth grayvein whitewa formerli exceedingli
abund in mani of the northern state while farther south there wa
anoth speci the checker white which wa also abund both of
these have now so complet disappear that in some local thei
ar almost never seen while their import rel ha becom
perhap the most abund of all american butterfli
the grayvein white
pieri napi
on would natur suppos that when a butterfli wa reduc to the
greatest possibl simplic in it color there would be littl
chanc for the develop of geograph or season varieti but
he would onli have to studi a larg collect of specimen of thi
speci taken at differ season and in differ region to find
hi supposit at fault here is a butterfli which is essenti a
slender blackbodi creatur with four white wing scarc touch
with color and yet we ar told that there ar eleven varieti in the
unit state so distinct that thei have receiv scientif name
not to mention variou other which have been found in europ thi
is inde a remark show and it is a strike illustr of
the infinit variat which natur can produc with the most limit
materi
to me the season variat of a butterfli ar alwai of greater
interest than those which ar geograph we know that in the case
of a great mani anim from insect to mammal the differ
condit of climat and physic environ found in differ
region produc variat of mani sort so it doe not seem
especi strang that in alaska there should be a differ form of
a certain butterfli than is found in virginia but that in the same
local there should be two or more form of a butterfli exist
under ident condit as to climat and environ is not so
easili explain in the case of the grayvein white we collect in
earli spring in new england or other northern state a lot of
chrysalid we keep them until the butterfli come forth and we find
even here two distinct form on smaller and more delic than the
other with both surfac of the wing pure white scientist call
thi form virginiensi the other larger with the under surfac of
the wing slightli tint with yellow scientist call thi form
oleracea the first name ha but on brood a year while the second
lai egg which develop into caterpillar that produc butterfli of
still a third form in which the upper surfac of the wing is pure
white with a slightli greater expans scientist call thi form
cruciferarum these three varieti occur in eastern region and mai
be found in the same local and differ consider from variou
geograph varieti found in the far west
the caterpillar of the grayvein white is a bit smaller than those
of the nearli relat form and in color is green with no distinct
longitudin mark but with mani fine dot of black over the
surfac the cylindr bodi is cover with a fine down when
feed upon cabbag it is more like to attack the outer than the
inner leav and so even when abund it is less troublesom to
garden than the import speci it is now howev so rare that
it seem to feed chiefli upon wild crucifer plant and is more
like to be found along the border of open wood than in garden and
field the winter is pass in the chrysali state
the checker white
pontia protodic
some year ago the checker white wa commonli call the southern
cabbag butterfli but the gener distribut of the import speci
ha had the same effect upon it abund in the south that it ha
had upon the grayvein white in the north consequ it is now
much less abund than formerli even in the southern state where it
is most at home there ar two fairli distinct form the spring form
and the summer form the latter is practic of the same size as the
import cabbag butterfli the male have the hind wing nearli white
abov and the fore wing with a few black dot or spot upon their
outer halv the femal ar much more definit mark have the
upper surfac of both pair of wing mark in black or brownish black
in such a wai as to enclos a larg number of white diamond the
spring form is decidedli smaller and the mark ar much less
distinct than in the summer form
the season histori of thi speci is compar simpl in
winter the chrysalid ar found from these chrysalid in earli spring
the small butterfli of the spring form come forth these lai egg
upon variou crucifer plant which hatch into greenish caterpillar
that eat the leav and soon matur so far as their caterpillar stage
is concern thei ar then about an inch long with downi cylindr
bodi more or less mark with rather pale yellow stripe touch
here and there with purplish green or dot slightli with fine black
dot these caterpillar now attach themselv by mean of a button of
silk and a silken loop to some support like a piec of board the side
of a stone or almost ani avail shelter each cast it larval
skin and appear as a grayish chrysali from which probabl a
fortnight later the summer form of the butterfli emerg there ar
commonli two brood of thi summer form make three set of
butterfli for the entir season the caterpillar of the second
summer brood of butterfli go into the chrysali stage in autumn to
remain throughout the winter
some veri interest observ upon the sleep habit of thi
butterfli have been made in st loui by mr and mr phil rau the
insect were found abundantli rest upon the seed head of white
snakeroot earli in octob when a warm south wind wa blow the
great major of the butterfli slept horizont with their head
toward the wind at other season and in other place mani of them
were found in a vertic posit but practic all had their bodi
toward the wind prevail at the time the observ were unabl to
ascertain definit whether the insect thu orient themselv at
the time of alight so that their wing present the least
resist to the forc of the wind or whether thi wa a mechan
result of the breez
the great southern white
pontia monust
there us to be in the northern state befor the advent of the
import cabbag butterfli a familiar white butterfli which then laid
it egg upon cabbag in much the same wai that the import pest now
doe on who ha seen thi northern grayvein white and then see
the great southern white will be like to think of the latter as a
larger edit of the former for in the male of the southern speci
the wing ar practic white save for a narrow duski border at the
outer angl of the front pair although in the femal thi duski
margin is wider and the hind wing show a seri of duski triangl
near the margin there is also a curiou black mark suggest of a
crescent on each front wing near the middl of the front border which
help to make the appear of thi butterfli veri distinct from that
of ani other
although thi speci is at time so abund that it swarm in great
flock and although it ha been known for mani year it lifehistori
seem not to have been carefulli work out sinc it wa first
describ by abbott more than a centuri ago the caterpillar feed
upon crucifer plant and when full grown ar about an inch and a
half long of a gener yellow color more or less stripe with
purpl line the speci is distinctli tropic extend northward
into our southern state
dr g b longstaff report thi speci as abund in jamaica where
he found that the club of the antenna of the live insect show a
beauti turquois blue color although anoth observ describ
them as bright green with a ting of blue thi is an interest
color variat for a member of thi group in the tropic also there
ar two form on belong to the dry season and on to the wet
season

the tribe of the orangetip
when on see a gossamerwing butterfli flit from flower to
flower on a bright june dai it seem on of the most ether of
earth vision on could readili fanci that the whole
sightflow butterfli and allmight easili vanish into thin
air so it is someth of a shock to hear scientist talk about
fossil butterfli and to realiz that these fragil creatur have
been live gener after gener for untold million of year
a realiz of thi fact howev help us to understand the mani
wonder wai in which butterfli in all stage of their exist
have becom adapt to the condit of their live
there is perhap no group of butterfli whose beauti seem more
fragil than that of the orangetip these ar delic creatur
with slender bodi and almost gauzi wing of a size somewhat smaller
than our common white and yellow butterfli perhap the most
remark featur is the mark of the wing the upper side of the
front pair have an orang patch near the apex and the under side
have a background of delic whitish or yellowish green line and
spot with darker color in a veri characterist wai thi
peculiar mark is so signific that it ha been call flower
pictur to understand the reason for it exist on ha onli to
watch the butterfli in their nativ haunt he will find them
flit from blossom to blossom among the plant of the mustard
familyth crucifera thi is on of the most characterist
famili in the plant world the foliag for the most part is small
and delic and the flower have a characterist fourpet
structur be practic alwai of small size and gener tone
in white or yellow when an orangetip is at rest upon these
blossom it merg so complet into the background that it
disappear from view should a bird chase on of these insect through
the air it would see chiefli the orang tip which ar so mark upon
the upper side of the wing and when the butterfli close it wing
and light among the flower the orang color would instantli
disappear and there would be onli an almost invis surfac against
the background of flower and leaf
the adapt of these orangetip to the condit of their live
ar by no mean confin to thi remark resembl to the floweri
background in the case of some speci the whole yearli cycl ha
been adapt to correspond to the yearli histori of the crucifer
food plant as is well known mani speci of the mustard famili spring
up earli in the season put forth their blossom which quickli develop
into fruit and then die down the speci be carri through until
the next year by the dormant seed in a similar wai the orangetip
feed as caterpillar upon the host plant through the spring
complet their growth befor the plant di and then chang to
chrysalid which remain dormant through summer fall and winter and
come forth as butterfli earli the follow spring the insect ha
thu adapt itself in a most remark manner to the yearli histori

the falcat orangetip
synchlo genutia
the falcat orangetip is about the onli member of thi tribe
gener distribut east of the rocki mountain thi is a beauti
insect which is sparingli found even as far north as new england it
is more abund throughout the southern state occur south at
least as far as texa it appear to be a good illustr of the
adapt of it develop to that of it food plant the egg ar
laid upon leav or stem of such springflow crucifera as
rock cress arabi and hedg mustard sisymbrium on hatch
the caterpillar feed upon stem leav flower and even seed pod
of these plant becom matur in a few week and chang to
chrysalid under the protect of such shelter as thei can find in
the northern state these chrysalid remain unchang until the
follow spring when the butterfli emerg and ar found upon the
wing for a few week in mai and earli june in some southern region
at least the speci is evid doublebrood as dr holland
report that he ha taken the butterfli in late autumn in the
western portion of north carolina

thi falcat orangetip is on of the daintiest and most exquisit of
northern butterfli it is a prize which ani collector will find joi
in possess it is easili recogn by it gener white color
which in the femal is reliev onli by a distinct black mark on the
upper surfac of the front wing and a row of margin mark upon
all the wing the male is slightli smaller and is at onc known by
the orang blotch on the outer angl of the upper surfac of the front

dr j l hancock ha describ in a most interest manner the wai
in which thi orangetip lose itself among the flower of rock cress
in northern indiana he found thi butterfli abund in april at the
time of the blossom of arabi lyrata the butterfli would be
fly about easili seen in the air then thei would suddenli
disappear and could be found onli after the most care search thei
had simpli lit upon the flower head when the flower pictur of the

the green mark of the under side of the wing write dr
hancock ar so arrang as to divid the ground color into patch
of white which blend with or simul perfectli the petal of the
cluster flower the ey of the butterfli ar delic pale green
and the antenna ar whitish all of which add to the effect
of the blend the flower of arabi have white petal with the
centr yellowish green as is also the calyx there is a shade of pink
outsid the base of the petal all in all the adapt of insect
to flower here displai is on of rare exquisitenessc
c natur sketch in temper america p 83
dr hancock found that the butterfli were abl to cling on the

have lit upon the cluster flower head
the olympian orangetip

northern maryland to northern missouri like it alli the larva
feed upon variou crucifer plant the hedg mustard be on of
these and the adult visit the flower of the same famili thei

practic all northern butterfli ar various mark in differ
color while the butterfli of tropic region ar commonli tint
in monoton though often show a splendid iridesc on with
veri littl experi can tell the look of a tropic butterfli and
would be like to sai at onc that the cloudless sulphur is on of
these the upper surfac of the wing of the male is a clear plain
sulphur with mere the narrowest possibl fring of brown around the
margin made onli by the color margin scale the under surfac is
lighter and spars dot in brown in the femal the margin
brown take on the shape of a seri of small crescent and there is a
singl round brown eyespot just in front of the middl of each front
wing
while the cloudless sulphur is without doubt essenti a tropic
speci it ha an extraordinari geograph rang it is extrem
abund in mexico cuba and the tropic zone in south america it
extend south even to northern patagonia and north to new england
wisconsin and nebraska
presum in the tropic thi speci breed continu on
gener follow anoth in regular success unless interrupt
by drought or other natur phenomena in our southern state there is
more or less interrupt by the winter season so that it is commonli
consid to have onli two brood the butterfli hibern
farther north there is probabl onli on brood in summer and perhap
not even that in the extrem limit of it rang for there is pretti
good evid that the specimen seen in the northern state ar
migrant from the south come singli or in scatter flock in earli
summer and if thei lai egg the butterfli of the new gener
return south in autumn but the precis condit ar not well known
and need care observ in variou local
the lifestori of a gener of these butterfli is much like that
of the other yellow the egg ar laid on in a place on the
leaflet of variou speci of wild senna cassia and soon hatch
into cylindr caterpillar that devour the tender leaflet in a
few week the caterpillar matur and chang to curiou and
characterist chrysalid the head project in the shape of a cone
and the back is so concav as to give the side view of the chrysali a
veri strike appear
like so mani of the yellow thi butterfli is sunlov and social in
it habit great number flock togeth their larg size and bright
color render them veri conspicu thei often alight on the
ground to sip moistur when thei have been liken to bed of yellow
crocus thei also fly long distanc in flock that attract much
attent it is like that the northward distribut take place in

other sulphur butterfli
the larg orang sulphur is a close relat butterfli of about the
same size in which the color is uniformli orangeyellow instead of
lemonyellow it also belong to the tropic occur in our extrem
southern state and rang occasion as far north as nebraska
the redbar sulphur is anoth splendid butterfli somewhat larger
than the brimston which is easili distinguish by the broad reddish
bar across the upper surfac of the front wing it is tropic but
migrat rare even as far north as indiana illinoi and wisconsin
the dogshead butterfli
meganostoma caesonia
the dogshead butterfli furnish on of the most remark exampl
of accident resembl in wing mark that can be found in the
whole order of scalewing insect it is compar with the skull

the middl of the front wing ha a broad band of yellow against a
black margin on each side and the yellow outlin make an excel
silhouett of the profil of a poodl with a larg black eyespot in
exactli the proper place the femal ar less brightli color than
the male but thei still show the dogshead silhouett
thi is a southern speci which occasion strai as far north as
new york citi new hampshir wisconsin and iowa the larva feed on
speci of amorpha and ar believ to be threebrood in southern
region where the butterfli occur
the california dogshead is even more beauti than the southern
speci it is remark for it pink and purpl iridescencea
characterist which is not common in the butterfli of the yellow

the cloud sulphur
eurymu philodic
it is an interest fact that the butterfli which on is most like
to find in field and along roadsid dure practic all the week
of summer ha seldom if ever been note as a destruct insect the
cloud sulphur is probabl the commonest speci in it group there
mai be time when the white cabbag butterfli or other form ar more
abund but the cloud sulphur retain it place season after
season with compar littl notic variat in it number
thi is doubtless an illustr of an insect which ha establish
such relat with it food plant and it variou insect and other
enemi that it remain in a fairli stabl equilibriuman exampl of
what is often call the balanc of natur
the cloud sulphur is about the onli mediums yellow butterfli
gener found in the northeastern state the adult mai be seen
from spring until autumn thei lai egg upon clover and other plant
these egg hatch into small green caterpillar that feed upon the
leav and ar protect color so thei ar compar seldom
seen when the food plant is disturb thei drop to the ground
crawl up again upon stem and leav when the disturb is over
these caterpillar moult sever time dure their growth when full
grown thei find such shelter as thei ar abl and each spin a silken
web over part of the surfac it then fasten it hind leg into thi
web and later spin a loop near the front end of the bodi it push
itself beneath thi loop and wait for sever hour befor the skin
break open along the back and is gradual shuffl off reveal the

like so mani other of thi group the orang sulphur is essenti a
tropic speci in the eastern unit state it is rare found
north of latitud forti degre but south of that it becom

variou disguis all of which ar now recogn as synonym in the
more northern region where it is found onli on of these form
usual occur but in other place bright yellow and pale white
varieti ar found
the lifehistori of thi butterfli along latitud forti degre is
veri similar to that of the cloud sulphur there seem to be usual
two brood and the caterpillar live upon legumin plant
especi alfalfa buffalo clover wild senna and other speci of
trifolium and cassia appar also it hibern in both the
caterpillar and the butterfli stage
in the extrem southwesta on the plain of texasth veget
dri up complet in summer so that there is no succul leafag
for the caterpillar to live upon in such case the insect must
aestiv rather than hibern thi speci appar succe in
do thi by have the caterpillar go into a more or less letharg
condit in which thei pass the summer the adult butterfli utterli
disappear in june and ar not seen again until earli in autumn when
the autumn rain have start the growth of veget anew the
insect then make up for lost time and produc sever brood in rapid
success
in the imperi vallei of california thi butterfli is a seriou pest
to alfalfa grower it continu to reproduc throughout a veri long

project on the front of the head when seen through a hand len
thi point project and the welldevelop characterist wing
sheath give the chrysali a remark resembl to some of the
twig hopper or membracid the color vari consider with the
surround but ar commonli tone in variou shade of green and
yellow brown
a littl later each chrysali break open to disclos on of the
beauti butterfli
the condit under which thi butterfli live at the limit of it
northern rang ar not well determin it is probabl that mani of
those seen here have flown from consider farther south and that
these migrant lai egg from which a brood of butterfli develop
these nativ born appear late in summer presum the latter
hibern but whether thei can do thi successfulli under the
rigor condit of our northern winter ha never been determin
in fact scudder wrote some year ago that no caterpillar had ever
been found in new england here is an interest opportun for some
young observ to make a real contribut to scienc
the littl sulphur
eurema lisa
were on to imagin a cloud sulphur butterfli reduc to half it
usual size and built with a correspond delicaci of structur on
would have a pretti good idea of the beauti littl creatur call
by the abov name i well rememb in my colleg dai take what wa
probabl the first of these butterfli ever collect in the region
of our michigan colleg it wa a prize that veri like had wander
north from indiana but which serv to add much glori to the littl
collect in which i took such pride for thi is essenti a
southern speci in mani region of the south it is so abund that
it can be taken by ani on it rang from coast to coast and extend
south into the tropic in the eastern region it is found from
southern wisconsin to southern new england occur sparingli and
local in variou place along the line thu indic
the food plant of the speci is chiefli wild senna or other kind of
cassia the mother butterfli deposit the egg singli on leav or
stem gener on the small leaflet of the compound leaf less than
a week later each egg hatch into a cylindr greenish caterpillar
that feed upon the leaflet in a characterist fashion instead of
devour the blade from the margin inward it gnaw narrow strip
between the smaller vein when not feed the caterpillar protect
themselv from observ by bird or other enemi by rest
motionless along the stem of the leaflet or els along the midrib on
the under side as is well known the leaflet of cassia like other
legumin plant close at night it is probabl on thi account that
these caterpillar feed chiefli by dai the gener green color of the
skin and the straight stripe along the side help to make thi
caterpillar veri inconspicu when it is at rest
when full grown the caterpillar reach a length of three quarter of
an inch it now find some bit of shelter on which it spin a bit of
flat web and a silken loop to hold it in place as it becom a
chrysali it then chang and remain quiescent for ten dai or more
when it emerg as the dainti butterfli
notwithstand it abund and it success brood it
lifehistori is none too complet work out there is still
opportun for care observ upon the wai in which it pass
the winter in variou part of it rang while in the south it
appar hibern as an adult thi fact is not certain in the
more northern local
notwithstand it diminut size thi butterfli ha been known to
swarm in such enorm number as to seem a verit cloud the most
notabl record of thi ha been quot by scudder in connect with a
swarm that invad the bermuda island in 1874 on the first dai of
octob it wa describ in these word

concours of small yellow butterfli which flit about all the

in tropic america there is a genu of butterfli call agrauli
these ar fairli larg insect approxim the size of the viceroi
which show most beauti color in the tropic sunshin on member
of thi genu ha come north to our southern state and is

which is veri suggest of the under surfac of our northern spangl
fritillari so thi beauti speci mai fittingli be call the

beauti and connect with the equal distinct beauti of the
tropic south
like so mani other southern butterfli the egg of thi speci ar

there is someth in the appear of the upper surfac of thi
butterfli that suggest the other fritillari on the on hand and the
emperor on the other the color and mark is a bit like the
former and the shape of the wing like the latter the gener color
is a golden brown with darker mark arrang in band and eyespot
in a rather complic pattern the under surfac so far as it is
expos when the butterfli is at rest is a beauti marbl
combin of grai and brown which is probabl distinctli
oblit in the haunt of these insect the front wing have the
outer margin concav in the middl give a special promin to the
shape of each front outer angl
thi butterfli is a southern rather than a northern speci but it is
found occasion from montana to massachusett and southward to
arizona mexico and florida even in northern indiana it is veri
seldom found and is consid rare in the southern part of that
state around buffalo new york it is also rare and is not common in
the vicin of new york citi in the more southern state howev
it is abund and extend well through the contin of south
america
there is consider evid to indic that thi butterfli
hibern as an adult in the more southern region it probabl also
hibern in other stage especi the chrysali and the larva in
region where it is doublebrood as it appear to be in the
latitud of new york citi the season histori seem to run someth
like thi the partli grown caterpillar which have pass the winter
in shelter at the surfac of the soil feed upon the leav of violet
and certain other plant thei chang to chrysalid probabl in mai
and emerg as butterfli in june these butterfli lai egg for a
summer brood of caterpillar which mai feed upon the leav of

cylindr worm of a gener reddish yellow color mark by
longitudin stripe of brown upon the side and a row of whitish dot
upon the back thei becom matur in time to disclos the butterfli
of the second brood in august and septemb presum these
butterfli lai egg that develop into caterpillar which hibern
when partial grown
farther south there ar probabl three brood a year and hibern
mai take place in variou stage there is good opportun for
care work in determin the lifehistori of the speci in
differ latitud the butterfli is found in much the same
situat as the other fritillari fly over meadow and along
the border of wood
the diana fritillari
argynni diana
thi magnific butterfli differ from the other fritillari in the
fact that the femal ar so unlik the male that onli a skill
naturalist would even guess that thei ar relat both sex ar
rather rare and ar found onli in a compar narrow rang
extend from west virginia to missouri northward to ohio and
indiana and southward to georgia and arkansa
thi speci wa first describ by cramer a long time ago from
specimen of the male sex it wa later describ by sai and other
writer all of whom saw onli the male the other sex wa first
recogn by william h edward whose account of it discoveri as
given in hi splendid work on the butterfli of north america is
worth quot
no mention is made of the femal by ani author wrote mr edward
and it seem to have been unknown till it discoveri by me in 1864 in
kanawha counti west virginia on the 20th august i saw for the
first time a male hover about the flower of the ironwe
vernonia fasciculata and succeed in take it two dai
afterward in same vicin while break my wai through a dens
thicket of the same weed hope to find anoth diana i came
suddenli upon a larg black and blue butterfli feed so quietli as
to allow me to stand near it some second and watch it motion it
seem to be a new speci of limen alli to ursula which it
resembl in color but on take it i saw it wa a femal argynni
and the gener pattern of the under wing left littl doubt of it
affin to the diana male despit it total differ in color and
of upper surfac subsequ captur confirm thi conjectur and
out of the larg number that have sinc been taken the male have been
of the known type and the femal black with no tendenc in either to
vari in the direct of the other
when my attent wa call to the speci i found it not veri
uncommon alwai upon or near the ironwe which is veri abund
and grow in rank luxuri upon the rich bottom land of the kanawha
river frequent reach a height from eight to ten feet and in
august cover by head of purpl flower that possess a remark
attract for most butterfli both sex ar conspicu the male
from the strong contrast of color and the femal from their great
size and the habit of alight on the topmost flower and rest with
wing erect and motionless it is an exceedingli alert and wari
speci differ in thi from our other argynnid at the slightest
alarm it will fly high into the wood near which upon the narrow
bottom or river slope it is invari found it is a true southern
speci sensit to cold not to be look for in the cooler part of
the morn but fly down from the forest when the sun is well up
from eleven to three oclock is it feed time
the lifehistori of thi fine butterfli is similar to that of the
lesser fritillari the butterfli appear from midsumm onward the
male preced the femal and the egg ar laid on or near violet
in august or septemb the larva hibern and matur earli the
follow summer as thei approach the chrysali stage thei ar rather
larg velveti black caterpillar with brown head and row of fleshi
barb spine that show an orang tint at their base there is thu
but on gener each year
the regal fritillari
argynn idalia
the regal fritillari fresh from the chrysali still show the
marvel sheen of it iridesc furnish on of the most
beauti exhibit of color in the world of natur over the whole
wing surfac there ar tini scale that reflect the sunlight in an
almost dazzl manner give a distinct purplish tone especi to
the hind wing
the regal fritillari is on of the largest butterfli of the
distinct group to which it belong the wing expand some three
inch and the rather thick bodi is more than an inch long the
gener ground color of the wing is brown with distinct mark of
blackish which in the hind wing almost obscur the brown on each of
the latter as seen from abov there is a distinct row of creamcolor
spot across the middl duplic by a similar row of brown spot
near the margin the under surfac of both pair of wing is much
lighter and thickli mottl all over with light creamcolor spot of
a larg size and more or less triangular shape see frontispiec
like the other argynnid the regal fritillari is singlebrood
dure the year and it ha a rather remark longev in each stage
of it life the newli hatch caterpillar go into hibern and
live through the winter without feed find shelter at the
surfac of the ground especi beneath the leav of violet which
form their chosen food plant when the snow ha disappear and the
warmth of the spring sun bring them out of their winter lethargi
these tini caterpillar feed upon the violet leav and grow slowli
for sever week thei then chang to chrysalid the time for do
thi vari consider with the individu and doubtless with the
warmth of the situat in which each is live the length of time
spent in the chrysali vari also but in gener it seem to be less
for those which develop into male butterfli than for the femal it
is a curiou fact that the former mai be found for nearli two week
befor ani of the latter appear
the first butterfli of thi speci ar usual disclos from the
chrysali late in june or earli in juli thei continu to come forth
for sever week appar until nearli the middl of august thei
lead a leisur life visit freeli the flower of goldenrod
ironwe boneset joe pye weed and especi swamp milkwe thei
ar most like to be found in lowland and along the border of
swamp where these favorit flower ar grow it evid requir
some time for the egg to develop within the ovari for the
butterfli cannot begin lai these until the latter part of august
thei appar ar normal deposit on the under side of violet
leav although so far as i know no butterfli ha been seen thu
lai her egg it would be an interest point for some young
observ to determin even the egg take a long time to develop not
hatch for three or four week after thei ar laid when thei do
hatch the tini caterpillar seem not to eat at all but to go directli
into hibern
these butterfli ar to be found in their prefer habitat almost
ani time dure juli august and septemb appar mani of them
live as adult for nearli three month so that whether we consid the
egg the larva the chrysali or the adult we have in thi speci an
unusu durat of life thi is doubtless an adapt to the fact
that the speci must get through the year with onli on brood
thi uniti of habit with no such variat as occur in mani
butterfli with a wider rang north and south is appar
correl with the distribut of thi butterfli it is found in a
belt of territori run from new england and the atlant state
westward at least to nebraska along a line which approxim the
annual isotherm of fifti degre fahrenheit
the great spangl fritillari
argynni cybel
to on who wander much in the wood and open field there ar few
summer scene more characterist of the season than that of a group
of milkwe in full flower surround by a host of brown butterfli
busili suck the nectar from the curiou pink blossom there ar
like to be sever speci of these wing creatur but in mani
region of america the largest and most conspicu will gener be
the great spangl fritillari thi butterfli is easili recogn by
it larg size and it combin of two color of brown with
whitish or silverish spot scatter over the lower surfac of the
wing
the lifehistori of thi insect is of peculiar interest on account of
the wai in which it pass the winter the mother butterfli remain
upon the wing through mani week in summer so that toward the end of
august or earli septemb a larg proport of the specimen have a
decidedli frai appear thei ar patient wait for the season
of the year when thei can deposit their egg appar know by
instinct that thi must not be done until earli autumn when the
proper season arriv thei lai their egg upon the leav or stem of
wild violet appar without much refer to the particular
speci sometim thei have been report simpli to drop the egg
loos upon the violet plant with no attempt to fasten them in place
have thu deposit the egg the mother butterfli soon die
it would not seem strang if these egg remain unhatch until the
follow spring but the fact is that the egg hatch veri soon into
small caterpillar that eat off part of the shell in order to escap
and sometim eat also part of the shell remain after thei have
emerg variou good observ have appar establish the fact
that these tini caterpillar eat noth els befor winter set in
it seem curiou inde that thei should not nibbl at the leav or
stem of the violet plant in order to be slightli prepar for the
long fast that await them befor thei will find food upon the young
bud the follow spring the case is somewhat similar to that of
the common tent caterpillar which becom a fulli form caterpillar
within the egg shell befor the end of autumn but remain unhatch
until the follow spring in the present case the caterpillar
hibern outsid of the egg shell rather than within it
when at last the warm sunshin of spring start the violet into new
growth the tini caterpillar begin feed upon the succul tissu
thei nibbl awai dai after dai for a week or more befor thei becom
so larg that thei have to cast their skin for the first time thei
then feed again and continu thi process of feed and moult
until earli in summer thei ar like to hide themselv dure
daylight and have the reput of be difficult to rear under
artifici condit
the fullgrown caterpillar wander along the surfac of the ground in
search of suitabl shelter for the chrysali period when it come to
a larg stone with side project more or less horizont or a log
ly upon the ground or even a larg piec of loos bark it is like
to stop and chang to the pupa or chrysali in thi condit it is
dark brown in color and well cover with thicken tubercl
especi along the back of the abdomen
about a fortnight later the chrysali break open and the fulli
develop butterfli come forth it rest quietli for a time while it
wing expand and the tissu harden and then salli forth for it
long period of flight for thi insect is singlebrood in the
northern state at least and the butterfli that thu matur late in
june or earli in juli ar like to remain aliv until earli in
septemb so thei have a compar long life for a butterfli that
doe not hibern as an adult
the silverspot fritillari
argynni aphrodit
our brown fritillari ar seldom found without sever speci
mingl togeth thi is not strang for thei have similar habit
throughout their entir live so when you see a bevi of butterfli
collect around the midsumm blossom of the milkwe you ar
pretti sure to find that the great spangl fritillari is associ
with the silverspot and probabl on or two other relat form the
silverspot is gener decidedli smaller than the on first name
and the surest wai to be certain of it is to look on the under side of
the hind wing and see whether there is a broad band of buff between
the two outer row of silver spot if thi band ha disappear or is
nearli all taken up by the brown groundcolor of the wing you mai be
pretti sure we have the silverspot fritillari
when on ha firmli fix in mind the life cycl of on of these
butterfli on ha a model after which to fashion the rest for our
sever speci ar remark alik in thi respect
the silverspot ar on the wing for sever week in summer dure
the latter part of thi time the femal lai egg upon violet leav
these egg shortli hatch into caterpillar that go directli into
hibern take no food befor winter set in the follow
spring thei feed upon violet leav and matur in time to chang to
chrysalid and emerg as butterfli in earli summer there is but on
brood a year and the speci is wide distribut over southern
canada and the northern state it extend south to virginia and
pennsylvania and west to nebraska montana and washington
the mountain silverspot
argynni atlanti
if on were abl to take a silverspot fritillari and reduc it size
about on third he would have a wonderfulli good imit of the
present speci except for the size about the onli differ in the
mark is found in the blackish border along the margin of the
mountain silverspot which is not present in the other speci the
buff submargin border line on the under surfac of the wing
between the row of silver spot is also wider in the mountain
speci
the distribut of thi butterfli justifi it name it is
premin a northern speci be especi abund in the
white mountain of new hampshir and rang northward far into canada
and west through british america as far as the mackenzi river a pair
of these butterfli were captur by merritt carei on juli 16 1903
on the summit of mount thaontha in the nahanni mountain at an
altitud of 2500 feet the southern limit of it distribut
approxim the isotherm of fortyf degre it extend southward
in mountain region through new york and pennsylvania and is found
in michigan illinoi and iowa it also occur in the rocki mountain
region of colorado
the variou speci of argynni show a remark uniform in their
lifehistori like the other thi butterfli is singlebrood
lai the egg on or near violet late in summer the egg hatch
into larva that take no food until the follow spring thei then
feed upon the violet leav becom matur and chang to chrysalid
in time for the butterfli to emerg in june in new hampshir these
butterfli remain upon the wing for sever week thei usual
appear a week or two earlier than aphrodit or cybel in region where
all three speci ar found it is worth while for the collector to
take a hint from thi fact and do hi silverspot collect earli
for after the other speci appear it is not so easi to tell which is
atlanti when the butterfli ar on the wing it is most like to be
found in open place in the wood appar prefer such
situat to the broad expans of field and meadow
the white mountain fritillari
argynni montinu
thi is distinctli a mountain butterfli known to be found onli near
the top of mount washington and other neighbor part of the white
mountain it gener occur between the altitud of four thousand
and fiftyf hundr feet it is doubtless close relat to a
somewhat similar form found farther north and west but it isol
from them is complet appar it is singlebrood and veri littl
is known of the earli stage the butterfli visit the flower of
goldenrod and those of the alpin sandwort which ar abund in the
subalpin home of thi speci
thi varieti is interest as a live souvenir of the dai when new

the fact of variat is on of the most univers thing in natur
no two anim ar exactli alik and everi plant differ from everi
other plant that thi is true of the structur of live thing is
easili observ but it is not so well known becaus not so easili
observ that most speci of anim differ also in the precis
phase of their growth we know that the variat in form and color
ha brought about the remark adapt to surround which we
call mimicri and protect color a littl consider will
make it evid that the variat of differ individu in period
of growth must have led also to the adapt of the life stage to
the condit of the chang season thi is particularli true in
the great major of insect which show remark adapt in
their variou brood to the season condit of the local
where thei live
from thi point of view the attract littl meadow fritillari is of
especi interest we ar indebt to the studi of s h scudder for
our knowledg of the remark variat in it growth these ar so
complic that in order to make plain the vari condit it
seem necessari to separ the brood in a somewhat hypothet
manner

we will begin with what we shall call group a the butterfli ar on
the wing in mai and earli june thei have just come from the chrysali
and continu live for three or four week befor thei deposit egg
thi time be requir in order that the egg mai develop in the
ovari of the butterfli these egg hatch in about a week and the
caterpillar becom full grown a month later thei then chang to
chrysalid in which condit thei remain anoth week thu requir
five or six week for the newli laid egg to matur into butterfli
suppos the egg were laid the first week in june the butterfli
of thi second brood would appear about the middl of juli the egg
in the ovari of some of these butterfli also requir sever week
befor thei ar readi to be laid so that it mai be about the tenth of
august when thi happen these hatch and matur to chrysalid dure
the next six week the butterfli of thi brood emerg about the
middl of septemb these in turn lai egg at onc appar no
extend period be requir for their develop befor thei ar
laid the egg hatch dure the latter part of septemb and the young
caterpillar feed upon the violet leav for two or three week
moult perhap twice and becom approxim half grown thei now
stop feed and go into a letharg condit in which thei
hibern then in spring thei awaken and feed again upon the violet
leav for a short time becom matur and chang to chrysalid
suffici earli to emerg as butterfli late in mai
in thi hypothet group we have a fairli normal condit of a
threebrood butterfli hibern in the stage of the halfgrown
larva and requir some week for the develop of the egg in the
ovari of the butterfli in the case of the first two brood but not
of the third
in anoth group which we mai design as b the condit mai be
similar except that the butterfli lai their egg veri soon after
come from the chrysali in the case of all three brood obvious
there would be a tendenc here for hasten the earli of the
brood so that the hibern caterpillar might either becom larger
or might go into the hibern condit earlier than those of
group a
in group c the variat take place in the larva rather than in the
butterfli these mai go on in the normal wai up to the time the
caterpillar of the summer brood becom half grown then thei becom
letharg ceas to feed and to all appear go into
hibern thei remain in thi condit until the follow spring
when thei come forth from their winter sleep and feed upon the
violet in precis the same wai as the caterpillar of the third
brood of group a and b
in group d we have anoth interest variat of the larva these
ar the same as c up to the time of becom letharg that is the
larva of the summer or second brood becom letharg at the same time
as those of group c but instead of continu in thi condit until
the follow spring thei remain in lethargi onli three or four week
then thei wake up have appar then chang their caterpillar
mind and begin to feed soon matur and chang to chrysalid
from which butterfli emerg late in septemb or earli in octob
the result is that these butterfli lai egg so late that the cold
night come on apac and the littl caterpillar appar take no
food at all but go into hibern immedi in consequ these
must eat for a longer period the follow spring so that the
butterfli into which thei matur will be like not to appear until
well along in june
it is probabl that even thi rather elabor statement doe not do
justic to all the variat in the develop of thi littl
butterfli but perhap enough ha been said to help us to understand
someth of the wai in which such insect ar abl to adapt their
life habit to the condit of their environ it is easi to see
that if condit should so chang as to give ani on of these group
a decid advantag over the other the tendenc would be for the
other group to disappear and for the group of favor habit to
surviv
the meadow fritillari is common in canada and the northern state east
of the rocki mountain it is found especi in lowland meadow and
along the border of swamp the veri situat chosen by the food
plant of the larva the blue and the white violet the butterfli
mai be often seen sip nectar from the variou speci of mint and
relat plant found in such situat it is commonli associ
with the silverbord fritillari from which it is easili
distinguish becaus it ha no silver spot upon it wing
the silverbord fritillari
brenthi myrina
thi attract littl butterfli bear a close gener resembl to
the meadow fritillari from which it differ chiefli by the continu
row of silver spot along the border of the under side of both pair
of wing it is found in the same local as the other and it
lifehistori is veri similar
the present speci is wide distribut in north america be
found as far west as the upper mississippi vallei and the rocki
mountain and southward as far as the carolina in new england and
the atlant state it is on of the commonest of the smaller
butterfli
begin with the butterfli which ar seen in the field and
meadow in septemb the yearli cycl of thi insect mai be
summar in thi wai the egg laid in septemb hatch in a few dai
into tini caterpillar some of which becom letharg at onc while
other begin feed upon the violet leav and continu thu to feed
until thei ar about half grown these then also becom letharg and
find shelter just abov the soil surfac where thei remain until the
follow spring thei then begin to feed again upon the violet leav
and at about the same time the other caterpillar which becam dormant
as soon as hatch also waken and feed upon these leav natur
those which were half grown at the begin of spring ar like to
matur and chang to chrysalid two or three week earlier than those
which were so small at the begin of the season consequ the
fresh butterfli will be found from late in mai to the latter part of
june presum those which first appear have develop from the
larger caterpillar and the later on from the smaller caterpillar
the butterfli of thi first brood of the season lai their egg upon
the violet leav gener upon the upper surfac of the blade but
occasion upon the stem or upon nearbi grass these egg hatch
in about a week into caterpillar that matur dure the next three or
four week come forth as a second brood of butterfli late in juli
or earli in august these in like manner lai their egg and develop
into a third brood which matur as butterfli in septemb these
lai egg that hatch into the caterpillar which live through the
winter there ar thu three brood of butterfli dure the year
and it is probabl that there is the same remark variat in the
habit of the differ brood that have been found in the eas of the

to the naturalist those island in the sea which ar remot from the

like to show the result of mani gener of live under uniqu
condit the plant and anim ar gener distinct mani of
the speci have characterist which differenti them markedli
from those upon the mainland thei show in a thousand wai the effect
of isol and so ar of especi valu when on attempt to
determin the result of unusu condit upon live thing
in a somewhat similar wai the peat bog or sphagnum swamp which occur
here and there over a larg part of north america ar of especi
interest becaus in a wai thei ar biolog island in which the
condit of a long past ag ar preserv until the present these
nearli alwai occur in a littl vallei surround on all side by
hill here the water ha collect origin into a pond or lake
which ha been gradual fill up through the growth of peat moss
and a special set of other plant that develop in such situat on
can still find mani stage in the process in some bog the surfac
will be practic cover although the water beneath mai still be
so abund that the mat moss quak as on walk over it
sometim such bog ar realli danger becaus the walker mai drop
through to the water beneath in most of the bog howev the littl
lake is nearli fill but show the surfac over a small area
the condit in these peat bog have chang littl sinc
civil began thei ar relic of an earlier era which have come
down to us as type of condit that onc exist veri gener
the plant life is uniqu and consist almost entir of form which
ar found practic nowher els there ar compar few
anim live in these peat bog and all of these ar like to be of
especi interest among the insect none is more remark than the
baltimor checkerspot butterfli which ha sever peculiar that
differenti it from the other member of the group it seem to have
come down to us unchang from a far remot past and to be live it
tranquil life todai in precis the same manner as dure the time
when the mammoth and the mastodon were like to invad it haunt
the baltimor is probabl the most local in it distribut of ani of
the butterfli found throughout canada and the northern state it is
to be look for onli in peat bog and swamp and it ha a remark
uniti in it lifehistori whether it be found in northern canada or as
far south as west virginia the butterfli itself is rather larg
measur a littl more than two inch across it expand wing and
be color with an unusu combin of fulvou and yellow upon a
black background it is present as a rule onli from about the first of
june to the middl of juli the egg in bunch of from on hundr
to four hundr ar laid upon the leav of the plant commonli call
snakehead or turtlehead chelon glabra thei do not hatch for
nearli three week then the littl caterpillar emerg togeth and
usual each eat a littl of the empti egg shell thei ar then
like to form a thin web over the under surfac of the leaf beneath
which thei remain as a small compani feed upon the succul green
tissu a littl later thei ar like to begin the construct of a
miniatur nest by spin a silken web over the young leav at the
top of the plant from thi time on thi silken nest serv as their
home and thei util it almost as effect as do our familiar
american tent caterpillar the nest which thei make in the fork of
the wild cherri tree the baltimor caterpillar often wander more or
less from their tentlik home but thei gener come back to feed as
well as to moult if the nest is injur by wind or rain all the
caterpillar turn out to repair it and as the need for new food
suppli aris thei also unit to enlarg the tent thi habit of
work togeth for the common good is veri suggest of the similar
habit of the american tent caterpillar door for go in and out
ar left in the tent dure it construct
the tent thu made is like to be desert after the first moult and
a new and larger on construct on anoth part of the plant two or
perhap three such nest mai be made from the time the caterpillar
hatch until after the second moult the last nest made is veri
like to be upon some neighbor bushi plant or at least to includ
some branch of such a plant if the bulk of the nest is made upon
snakehead for after the third moult the caterpillar stop feed
and becom more or less quiet thu begin a nine month fast
dure which thei ar simpli to wait until the return of spring thi
fast mai be begun ani time from the middl of august until earli in
septemb and even when brought indoor the caterpillar cannot be
induc to eat it is evid the wai in which the speci ha
bridg over the winter dure the thousand of gener of it
exist and the instinct is so firmli fix that it cannot be
chang even in west virginia where the caterpillar would have
plenti of time dure the summer to matur as butterfli that would
bring forth anoth gener of caterpillar that might pass the
winter the condit is the same as in the far northern region
so within the shelter of the silken nest these baltimor caterpillar
remain from the middl of august until mai then when the spring
sunshin ha suffici warm their cool retreat thei come forth
and feed greedili upon the young leav thei now soon make up for
lost time and complet their growth as caterpillar veri quickli
when full fed thei wander about in all direct each hunt it
own shelter befor becom a chrysali have found a twig or branch
that suit their purpos each hang downward and chang to a brownish
yellow chrysali more or less mark with black it remain in thi
condit for about a fortnight when it come forth as the baltimor
butterfli which thu appear again about the first of june
these butterfli seem to have some of the characterist of their
uniqu surround there ar veri few flower in the peat bog and
it is signific that the butterfli instead of flit from flower
to flower as do most of our familiar speci fly rather in a slow
and lazi fashion from leaf to leaf light upon the foliag or
frequent upon the surfac of the moss or ground thei seem letharg
and have littl of the anim which we usual associ with the
name butterfli
in my mind the baltimor is associ with the white mountain
butterfli as a survivor of a former geolog period the latter wa
develop under colder condit and now surviv onli on a few
isol mountain peak but the former ha surviv wherev the peat
bog ha held it swai dure the long ag that the surround
landscap ha been take on it presentdai condit mani thing in
the life of the baltimor point to it primit condit the lai
of the egg in loos cluster the long lethargi of the caterpillar
the limit flight of the butterfliesal indic a creatur with
habit firmli fix by long ag of develop in a definit
environ
no collector should feel sure that the baltimor is not to be on of
hi trophi until he ha visit in june everi peat bog or sphagnum
swamp in hi local on mai search year without find it and
then come across a dozen in a singl dai i well rememb the interest
with which i first found thi speci on the margin of a great swamp
in michigan when i wa eager for everi new butterfli to add to my
collect i had never seen it aliv befor and the thrill with which
the first specimen wa captur can be realiz onli by those
rememb similar experi
harriss checkerspot
cinclidia harrisii
thi littl butterfli so close resembl the pearl crescent and the
silver crescent that on the wing it is easili mistaken for them it
realli look more like them than it doe the baltimor checkerspot
which is consider larger and darker color than the present
speci thi is essenti a northern form occur onli in a
narrow strip of countri east of minnesota and wisconsin run on
the north through southern canada and on the south through michigan
new york and massachusett
thi insect is on of the bestknown botanist among all the
butterfli in the veri difficult group of aster which ha caus
endless confus to human botanist these insect seem alwai abl to
select the on speciesast umbellatu it ha been repeatedli
found that the caterpillar would starv rather than eat the leav of
other kind of aster and so far as known thei have never been found
feed outdoor upon ani other
these butterfli appear along roadsid and in open field about the
middl of june thei ar often veri abund and ar much more
gener distribut than the baltimor checkerspot a few week
later the femal lai their egg upon the aster leav the egg be
deposit in cluster of twenti or more on the under side of the leaf
earli in juli the littl caterpillar come forth and remain togeth
in coloni as thei feed upon the green tissu of the leav each is
abl to spin a silken thread so that wherev thei go thei weav a web
and thei soon protect themselv with a slight silken shelter which
is suggest of the nest made by the baltimor caterpillar thei
continu to live in thi manner for sever week in juli and august
grow rather gradual and becom approxim half grown befor
the frost of autumn unlik the baltimor caterpillar thei now
desert their nest and find shelter at or near the surfac of the
ground here thei hibern to come forth the follow spring and
feed again upon the new growth of the aster plant often do
consider damag by denud the young shoot of their leav thei
becom full grown in time to chang to chrysalid so that the
butterfli mai emerg in june
the silver crescent
charidrya nyctei
while thi speci ha not the broad distribut for which the pearl
crescent is notabl it occur over a larg part of the unit state
it distribut is bound broadli by a line run from southern
canada north of main to a point in southern canada north of montana
whenc it run south through wyom and utah to the corner of
arizona and thenc east through new mexico and texa to ohio and west
virginia extend south near the coast to north carolina it thu
includ a broad belt of territori occupi fulli on half of the
area of the unit state
throughout thi vast area the silver crescent is often a pure local
speci occur abundantli dure it brief season in some
favor local but seldom be seen in other place near by in
the north it is singlebrood the butterfli appear on the wing
dure june and commonli disappear earli in juli late in june the
femal lai their egg in cluster of a hundr or less on the under
surfac of the leav of variou composit plant notabl sunflow
aster and a common speci of actinomeri a week or more later
these hatch into littl caterpillar that feed togeth in coloni
upon the green tissu of the leaf take onli the succul
parenchyma and leav the network of vein as on leaf is thu
denud thei migrat to anoth in thi wai pass from leaf to leaf
for sever week in summer thei continu to feed until about half
grown when thei desert the food plant and find shelter at the soil
surfac here thei becom letharg and hibern until the follow
spring thei then arous again and feed upon the tender leav of the
new growth continu to eat and grow for a few week befor thei
becom matur as caterpillar and chang to chrysalid a littl later
the chrysalid disclos the butterfli which as alreadi indic
appear in june
in more southern region the lifestori of the speci is not so
simpl there is at least a partial second brood and it is probabl
that in mani local the speci is both singlebrood and
doublebrood in such a case some of the caterpillar go into
hibern probabl about midsumm remain quiescent through the
later week of summer and all the week of fall and winter while
other would matur to chrysalid and butterfli in summer and the
butterfli would lai egg for a second brood of larva which would
hibern when partial grown there ar opportun for care
observ to do good work upon the lifehistori of thi speci in
mani part of it rang
the pearl crescent
phyciod tharo
some year ago mr samuel h scudder the most notabl student of new
england butterfli wrote a delight essai with the titl
butterfli as botanist from hi long experi in rear the
egg of these insect he conclud that the egglai femal know in
a most remark wai the precis kind of leav upon which to
oviposit he educ mani illustr in proof of the fact and quot
a remark of asa grai the most emin of american botanist that is
worth repeat at that time scudder had reason to believ that the
pearl crescent laid it egg exclus upon the new england aster
now the aster as a group have been a sourc of much troubl to the
botanist who have attempt to classifi them as to speci and
varieti the variou form ar so similar to on anoth that
differ author have not agre as to the limit of the
speci so when grai wa told that thi littl butterfli wa abl
alwai to distinguish and select for her egglai a singl speci
of thi vex tribe he repli if your butterfli select onli that
it is a better botanist than most of us
while later observ have found that thi beauti littl insect is
not so exclus in it choic of a food plant as wa formerli
believ it serv to illustr the fact that a larg proport of
the caterpillar of thi group have a veri narrow rang of food
plant in nearli everi case where the food is thu restrict the
insect feed onli upon speci which ar close relat to on
anoth gener fall within a singl genu accord to the
classif of the botanist
there ha been much discuss in regard to the wai in which the
mother butterfli know the particular speci which she choos for
oviposit experi appar have shown that she is not
depend upon the sens of sight but rather upon the sens of smell
which as is well known is much more highli develop in insect than
in the higher anim i suppos it is not veri strang that a
creatur which ha fed from infanc upon leav with a certain tast
and odor should in it later life respond onli to that particular odor
and should neglect all other in a wai the butterfli itself is a
product of the plant and it probabl is not necessari to assum that
each butterfli differenti the odor of all kind of plant but
onli that she respond to the fragranc of the on with which she ha
been particularli associ

thi idea mai suggest to variou observ an interest point of

and alight upon the leav rather than the blossom you mai be
pretti sure that she is bent upon egglai now watch her to see if
she goe at onc to the particular kind of leav she final select

abund and distribut
few butterfli ar more abund or more wide distribut
throughout north america than the beauti littl pearl crescent it
occur over practic the whole of the unit state and canada and
is found from earli in spring until late in autumn it is a rather
small speci with a wing expans of onli about an inch and a quarter
the upper surfac of the wing be that tone of reddish brown call
fulvou more or less mark with black wavi line and dot the under
surfac is similar in color with a small silver crescent near the
outer margin of each hind wing
these butterfli ar not veri activ creatur although thei ar
commonli found in meadow and pastur along brook and by the border
of open wood instead of lai their egg singli as do so mani of
the more activ butterfli thei lai them in cluster often of a
hundr or more on layer of egg be place abov the other upon
the aster leaf in at least on case observ the caterpillar hatch
from the layer farthest awai from the leaf surfac befor those of the
layer next the leaf surfac emerg thi is an interest provis
for were the latter to come out first thei would be like to
disarrang the unhatch egg the caterpillar appear about a week
after the egg ar laid and remain togeth in crowd coloni that
feed upon the upper surfac of the aster leaf at first thei eat onli
the green tissu leav the bare vein although thei ar not
care to denud the entir surfac of the leaf as so mani other
caterpillar do as on leaf is exhaust thei pass to anoth near
by continu thu to feed in compani for a few week their
gener color is blackish although the black is reliev with yellow
dot along the back and a band of a similar color on each side unlik
the larger social caterpillar of the mourn cloak and other
butterfli these larva do not spin ani thread as thei crawl from
place to place so there is absolut no nest made upon the aster
leaf thi mai possibl be correl with the fact that these
caterpillar ar sluggish creatur and when disturb drop quickli to
the soil beneath
when the caterpillar ar full grown thei fall or crawl to the ground
and scatter more or less in search of shelter each attach itself to
ani protect it mai have found and chang to a grayish or brownish
chrysali more or less angular it remain in thi condit for a
period that vari greatli with the weather condit averag
about two week
there ar two distinct form of these butterfli which vari so
greatli that thei were onc consid separ speci thei ar now
known howev to be onli season variat in new england two
brood of the insect occur on in spring the other in summer the
spring form is call technic phyciod tharo tharo in thi
form the under surfac of the hind wing is veri distinctli mark
with blackish spot the summer form is call phyciod tharo
morpheu it is notic larger than the spring form and it ha
veri few mark on the under surfac of the hind wing
the yearli histori
as it occur in new england the yearli histori of thi littl
butterfli run someth like thi the spring form of the adult
appear in mai and lai egg upon the aster leav these egg hatch
into caterpillar that feed upon the aster leav for sever week
and then chang to chrysalid remain in the latter stage ten dai
or two week thei then come from the chrysalid in the form of the
summer butterfli which begin to appear about the middl of juli and
continu to emerg for at least a month these lai egg upon the aster
leav again and the littl caterpillar that hatch from them feed for
a few week or until about the last of septemb thei ar then onli
partial grown but thei make no attempt to complet their
transform at thi time instead thei drop to the ground and go
into hibern remain in thi condit until earli the
follow spring thei then begin feed again and complet their
develop in time to emerg as the spring form of the butterfli in
mai
some veri interest experi by william h edward have shown
that the smaller darker spring form of the butterfli is due to cold
he place upon ic chrysalid that would normal produc the summer
form and found that the specimen so treat produc the spring form
thi butterfli is on of the best known exampl of the variat in
the yearli cycl due to differ in latitud thi is readili shown
by a brief summari of it lifehistori from north to south
in the far northern climat of labrador there is but on brood a year
and the butterfli belong to what i have been call the spring
form the butterfli appear on the wing in earli summer lai their
egg upon the aster leav and die the egg hatch into caterpillar
that feed for sever week then becom dormant and remain in such
shelter as thei can find until the follow spring thei then chang
to chrysalid to emerg as butterfli a littl later there is thu
but on brood a year and the onli form of the butterfli is the small
darker color varieti
as far south as southern canada there is a slight variat in thi
yearli cycl the spring form of the butterfli appear in mai and
lai egg the egg hatch into caterpillar part of these
caterpillar matur within a few week chang to chrysalid and come
out in juli or august as the larger summer form of the butterfli
which in turn lai egg for the caterpillar that ar to winter over
in a dormant condit and matur the follow season but the
signific fact is that not all of the caterpillar which thu have
hatch in spring go through thi cycl part of them becom dormant
when partial grown and continu dormant through summer autumn and
winter just as thei did in labrador then in spring thei develop into
the spring form of the butterfli along with the caterpillar that
have hatch from the egg laid in summer there is thu what is
call an overlap of the brood
farther south in southern new england the lifehistori is more
definit twobrood each year as alreadi describ in an earlier
paragraph still farther south in the region of the virginia it is
definit threebrood there be at least two summer brood
dure the year how is it that the instinct to becom letharg li
dormant in the summer brood of caterpillar and show itself onli in
the autumn brood is it perhap due to a reaction to the colder night
of the later season if so possibl on could get interest light
upon the subject by experi with place the summer caterpillar

harriss checkerspot cinclidia harrisii or melitaea harrisii
expans 1 34 inch thi speci bear a close gener resembl
to the silver crescent it mai be distinguish by the fact that the
middl joint of each palpu is of uniform size from end to end instead
of taper toward it outer end the tibial joint of the first pair

silver crescent charidrya nyctei melitaea nyctei or
phyciod nyctei expans 1 34 inch thi speci mai be known
from harriss checkerspot by the fact that the middl joint of each
palpu taper from the middl to the tip and that the tibia of each
front leg in the male is slender rather than stout on the lower
surfac of the wing there is a narrow yellowish margin line
pearl crescent phyciod tharo or melitaea tharo expans

termin joint of each palpu less than a third as long as the middl

the tribe of the anglew
the special characterist that distinguish the member of thi
import group from the other nymph is the fact that on that portion
of the club of each antenna which ha not hair there ar three
longitudin ridg the tribe includ a larg number of our most
familiar butterfli nearli all of them ar rather larg with bright
attract color thei fly freeli along roadsid and in orchard
field and meadow so thei ar commonli seen by everi on
the violettip
polygonia interrogationi
the violettip is on of the largest of the anglew as well as
on of the most beauti of all our speci it ha a wonder
violet iridesc which is especi mark on the project tip of
the hind wing on fresh specimen howev it mai be seen practic
all over both surfac of the wing and in bright sunlight give them
a sheen of remark beauti the expand wing measur nearli two
and a half inch the upper surfac be mark with dark brown
upon a ground of orangebrown the under surfac ha a barklik
effect in brownish grai brought about by rather indefinit mark of
vari tone the most characterist featur is a distinct silver
semicolon on the middl of the under surfac of each hind wing thi
mark close resembl the greek interrog point and so the
speci wa given the specif name interrogationi by fabriciu
earli in the histori of scienc it ha sinc often been call the
interrog butterfli as a translat of it latin name but in as
much as the mark on the wing is not at all like the english
interrog point thi ha led to consider confus and peopl
have consid it a misnom it ha also been call the semicolon
butterfli which is correct enough so far as thi most characterist
featur is concern but it lead to confus in connect with the
latin name the recent practic seem the better which is to call it
the violettip butterfli
lifehistori
the lifehistori of thi butterfli is much like that of the relat
speci briefli summar thi is it stori
the adult butterfli more or less worn and fade from their long
hibern appear in field and pastur in mai thei fly for
sever week sip nectar from mani kind of spring flower the
femal search for the leav of the elm hop nettl fals nettl
and perhap other relat plant on which thei deposit their rib
egg either singli or in small group it often happen that on egg
will be laid directli on top of anoth about a week later the egg
hatch into small spinos caterpillar which begin feed upon the
leav near by thei continu to feed and grow rather rapidli until
thei becom full size each then fasten a bit of pink silk to the
stem of the plant or some other support in which it entangl it
hind leg and hang downward to becom a chrysali which is remark
for it numer protuber and the beauti silveri and golden
spot along the middl of the back within these chrysalid the chang
from larva to butterfli take place usual in less than two week
so that thi new brood of adult appear on the wing earli in juli
egg ar laid by these for a second brood of caterpillar that feed
upon the host plant in the same wai as the other and matur as
butterfli late in august or earli in septemb these butterfli
visit the fall flower and suck the juic of fallen fruit until the
cold weather of autumn warn them to seek shelter for the winter thei
now find crevic within the bark of tree or place in hollow log or
stone pile or other similar situat where thei close their wing
togeth so that onli the barklik under surfac show and remain
quiet for long period thei hibern in thi wai come forth again
the follow season to start the cycl for the new year
in region where hop ar grown commerci the chrysalid of these
butterfli ar often call hop merchant there is a quaint fanci
that the price of the crop vari with the lustr of the golden spot
upon the chrysalid when these stand out conspicu accord to
thi fanci the hop ar to sell highbring much gold to the
owner when these ar inconspicu the hop ar to sell at a low
price with a correspond diminut in the return but thi fanci
doe not appli at all to the chrysalid when thei ar nearli readi to
disclos the butterfli for at thi time thei lose their metal
lustr
the hop merchant or comma
polygonia comma
there ar two speci of butterfli which commonli lai their egg
upon the hop and which resembl each other so close in their earlier
stage that thei ar frequent confus by ordinari observ on is
the violettip or semicolon and the other is the on which ha long
been call the comma the chrysalid of both ar mark in silver and
gold and the variat in the golden lustr ha led hop grower to
deduc from them the probabl price of hop on thi account the
chrysalid ar commonli call hop merchant and the name ha been
transfer to the butterfli themselv see plate page 144
the comma is easili distinguish by the conspicu silver mark in
the middl of the under side of each hind wing thi bear a strike
resembl to a comma henc the name the butterfli ar somewhat
smaller than the violettip and show to a remark degre the
angular in the border of the wing the under side is cleverli
mark in imit of the bark of tree which is doubtless of much
benefit to the speci in elud observ dure the long month
from octob until april when the butterfli ar hibern in such
conceal shelter as each happen to find the crevic beneath loos
bark the open in fallen log and hollow tree the interspac in
stone pile as well as the interior of build all serv thi
purpos
like the other overwint butterfli the specimen that come
forth in spring ar commonli fade and more or less frai from their
long wait sinc burst forth from the chrysali thei mai often be
seen sun themselv on bright dai in april and mai rest upon
stone or log in shelter spot with their wing fulli expand to
receiv the greatest benefit from the rai of sunshin
illustr egg laid in stringlik cluster on the under
side of leaf magnifi from holland
when spring ha suffici advanc for the leav of the elm and
the hop to be fairli well develop the mother butterfli lai their
egg in a curiou and characterist fashion under a len these egg
look like tini barrel with vertic rib thei ar deposit in
column the egg first extrud be attach to the leaf gener
the under surfac and those which follow ar place on upon the
other sometim to the number of six or eight the group thu make a
miniatur column now if the egg which wa first laid should hatch
befor the other when the littl caterpillar came out it would be
veri like to caus the other to fall off and when thei hatch thei
would find themselv in what would be to them an impenetr forest
of weed and grass from which there would be small chanc to escap
to reach the elm or hop leav to avoid thi calam we find an
interest adapt the egg at the end of the column hatch
first although it wa necessarili the on laid last the tini
caterpillar eat it wai out of the shell and crawl over the other
egg to the leaf then the other hatch in success
the egg thu deposit by the hibern butterfli ar like to
be laid late in mai or even earli in june thei hatch into
caterpillar less than a week later and these caterpillar feed for
about a month when thei chang to the characterist chrysalid in
which thei commonli remain for a week or ten dai thei then emerg as
the summer brood of butterfli most of them in new england appear
dure juli these remain upon the wing for sever week the femal
lai their egg upon the elm and hop leav these in turn soon
hatch into caterpillar that chang to chrysalid in august and emerg
as butterfli late that month or dure septemb thi autumn brood
of butterfli is quit abund for a time but soon seek the
seclus of winter quarter to remain until the follow april
there ar thu two distinct brood dure the year in the northern
state while as far south as west virginia there ar like to be
three brood
these caterpillar at first simpli eat small hole in the green
substanc of the leaf but as thei becom larger each take up it
abod on the under surfac of a singl leaf and make a shelter tent
in somewhat the same fashion that the paint ladi doe upon the
nettl leaf the caterpillar eat out more or less of the base of the
blade on each side of the midrib thu weaken the edg so that
thei can be fasten in a tentlik manner by silken thread thi
serv as a rest place from which it salli forth to feed
commonli onli toward the tip of the leaf as a result it often eat
itself out of hous and home and ha to crawl to anoth leaf and
construct a new shelter
while the comma is gener spoken of as a characterist northern
speci it ha a veri wide rang be found from new england to
texa and from the northwestern state to the carolina it is on of
those speci which have two distinct form of color the winter
form ha been given the varieti name harrisii the butterfli of
thi brood ar decidedli lighter in color than those of the summer
brood to which the varieti name drya ha been given the latter wa
origin describ as a distinct speci by w h edward
the chang to the chrysali
the manner in which a larva chang to a chrysali is second in
interest onli to that in which a chrysali chang to a butterfli
there ar not a great mani care descript by compet observ
of thi process in print on of the best of these is that by w h
edward in hi splendid work on the butterfli of north america in
which he describ the transform of the comma caterpillar it is
as follow
when about to transform the caterpillar select a conveni place
on the under side of a project rock or of a fenc rail or of a
weather board of the hous or the midrib of a hop leaf and have
spun a littl button of pale red silk fix the hook of it hind leg
therein and hang suspend head downward in the shape of a fishhook
and remain immov for the space of twentyfour hour no chang
be percept except in the color of the skin which becom
partli transpar and lose it dark color ow to it gradual
part from the chrysali within suddenli and to a lookeron
without ani premonitori symptom a rent take place in the skin at the
back of the head just wide enough to allow the passag of the
chrysali the head of which at onc emerg by a rapid contract
and expans of the fold of the abdomen the larva draw the skin
upward success discov the part of the fulli form
chrysalid until at last and in scarc more than on minut of time
the entir skin is gather about the hind feet it now bend itself
violent to disengag the end of the chrysali which is long
point and hard furnish with sever littl hook meanwhil
retain it hold of the skin by the fold of it abdomen until after
a sever effort convuls reach out and feel in all
direct for the object of it search it touch the button of silk
and at onc grasp it with it hook and fix them in it secur
then by a twist motion it manag to disengag the loos skin which
fall to the ground and the chrysali rest the whole process is most
interest to wit and excit renew wonder with everi
repetit at the ingenu of the mean emploi and the delicaci of
the instinct displai how to strip off the skin and much more the
leg by which the creatur is suspend without lose it hold and
at the same time to secur fasten the chrysali is a problem that
would seem imposs to solv and yet thi littl insect
accomplish it unerringli when to fail would be certain destruct
and not thi speci onli but the larva of all butterfli which
form suspend chrysalid embrac the whole of the great famili of
nymphalida that is a larg proport of all the exist speci
of butterfli undergo a similar transform
the chrysali is now green in color soft and indefens
suscept to the slightest injuri and for a few moment the sever
part of the futur butterfli mai be seen and readili separ the
wing fold close and envelop the thorax the antenna and
probosci stretch at length along the back but veri speedili a
complet case is form by the exud from part of the bodi of a
viscou fluid which bind togeth the tender part and cover the
whole with a coat like varnish thi soon harden and the chrysali
is readi to take it chanc against injuri
the grai comma

thi butterfli is rather darker color especi on it under side

crawl up the stem of the plant to the unfold bud at the top
here it make it first nest by web togeth the still close
upper surfac of a leaf not yet unfold it is thu abl to furnish

a week then it cast it skin still within it protect and stai
until it ha recov after the process it now migrat to anoth
larger expand leaf where it veri cleverli proce to construct it
second nest in order to do thi it weaken the midrib at the base of
the leaf by bite nearli through it then it cut a hole in the blade
of the leaf at the base in such a wai that the margin ar made to
droop so that thei can be fasten togeth with silk to form a
littl tent we thu have a tentlik nest hang down from the stem
of the leaf on the under side of which the caterpillar will find
shelter while near at hand is the green tissu of the inner surfac
of the leaf wait to be eaten thi improvis tent serv as the

moult commonli take place after which the caterpillar migrat to a
new leaf and construct it third nest the rest of the stori of the
caterpillar life consist of similar chapter after each moult a
new tent is form and even the chrysali is often hung within the
last on
the egg which were laid late in mai develop into butterfli dure
juli these in turn lai egg for the second brood of caterpillar most
of which develop into butterfli late in august or earli in
septemb but some of which appar remain in the chrysali stage
unchang throughout the winter and matur as butterfli about the

mention at the begin of thi discuss that on can find late
in spring and earli in summer some butterfli which seem worn and
frai while other seem perfectli fresh thei ar all the progeni of
the midsumm brood of the previou summer but some of them have been
live as fullgrown butterfli through eight long month of
tempestu weather while other have just been disclos from the
protect wall of the chrysali
the worldwid distribut of thi butterfli is shown in the
statement that it occur throughout europ and in north america from
newfoundland to cuba and guatemala it is a safe guess that it is
found in practic all local where nettl grow
it is not alon the associ between a butterfli caterpillar and
it host plant which ha been brought about dure the long ag
through which on gener ha been succeed anoth but there
have been also mani develop of similar associ between the

exampl of such a develop dure it long growth as a speci it
ha been expos to attack by vast number of tini foe which live at
the expens of other insect sever of these foe have found in the
bodi of the caterpillar good opportun for growth so that now
the red admir as a speci ha to reckon with mani enemi among
these tini parasit the interact between caterpillar host and
uninvit parasit guest ha much to do with the great irregular
in the number of the butterfli it is simpli anoth exampl of
that complic struggl for exist by mean of which natur

the paint beauti
vanessa huntera
on of the most interest phase of the studi of butterfli is to
learn how often thei take advantag in their lifehistori of ani
peculiar of the food plant which ha a protect valu the
paint beauti is an excel illustr of thi the caterpillar
feed upon the leav of the common everlast or gnaphalium thi is
an abund and wide distribut plant found along roadsid and in

leav and flowersthi dry hairi surfac be so evid that the
flower will appar continu in blossom when thei have dri
henc it common name everlast or as the french call a similar
flower immortel see plate page 161
the util of the hair upon the leav is begun by the mother
butterfli when she lai her egg upon the upper surfac push it
down among the hair so that it is almost conceal should you be
fortun enough to find on of these egg you would see that it is a
small yellowish green object look like a tini barrel with sever
vertic rib upon it surfac a few dai after the egg is laid it
hatch into a minut caterpillar that begin eat off the hair
where thei ar attach to the leaf in such a wai that it soon ha a
free space beneath a bunch of these hair which it ha more or less
mat togeth by mean of silken thread the littl caterpillar ha
thu provid for itself a protect nest that effectu conceal
it from bird or other enemi it now begin feed upon the
succul surfac of the rather thick leaf where it ha remov the
hair after sever dai of such feed it moult still under the
shelter of it hairi cover thi process of moult and feed
continu for two or three week the caterpillar occasion make
a new cover as need for it food suppli
the later nest ar like to be made by fold two or three leav
togeth bind them with silken thread the caterpillar in do
thi take advantag of the fact that the termin leav ar vertic
befor thei have spread out so that it is a compar simpl
matter to make a littl hous by bind their edg togeth with
silken thread the larva feed upon the inner wall of the hous it
thu construct and as it becom larger the bud and blossom ar
also util for food
when the caterpillar is full grown it thu find itself fairli well
conceal within a veri substanti sort of a home mani of them have
the appar good sens to realiz that thi is as safe a place as
thei ar like to find for shelter dure the period of the
chrysali so the caterpillar make the nest especi secur near
the centr of what might be call the ceil and in thi web it
entangl it hind leg and hang downward preparatori to chang to
the chrysali a few hour later the skin split apart and is wriggl
off leav the chrysali hang in place of the caterpillar about
a fortnight later the butterfli emerg and crawl at onc to the
outsid of the nest where it rest quietli while it wing expand and
it tissu harden then it fli awai in search of the nectar of
thistl and mani other flower which it visit freeli
thi paint beauti is a wonder exampl of harmoni color the

our stori of thi beauti butterfli ought realli to begin with that
of on of the most success plant in the world now a plant is
success from it own point of view when it is abl to multipli
abundantli in mani differ sort of situat and to spread easili
over a larg area the plant i have in mind is the thistl which
from time immemori ha been on of the commonest neighbor of man
it is found over the whole habit globe as well as in mani part
which ar scarc habit it ha mani advantag in it struggl
for life the root penetr deepli into the soil the thicken
spini leav ar so protect by their juic and their spine that
thei ar molest by veri few enemi the flower stalk ar also
cloth in a similar armatur and the great head of flower ar
surround with prickli involucr that gener prevent their be
eaten by brows anim or even by phytophag insect the
brightli color blossom ar abundantli provid with nectar and
pollen and thei attract great number of bee moth and
butterfli in order to bring about crossfertil but all of
these advantag ar of littl signific so far as wide
distribut is concern compar with the featheri seed which ar
produc in such abund and so gener scatter by the slightest
breath of wind that the word thistledown ha come into gener us to
express a lightli move object these airi seed have been ride on
the wing of the wind all over the surfac of the earth for untold
million of year doubtless dure sever storm thei mai be carri
thousand of mile and it is easi to think that on of them might
readili go halfwai round the world befor it found a rest place
wherev such a seed alight and found the condit of a moist soil
and slight protect it would be like soon to spring into growth
and to start anew the develop of it ancient race
the thistl howev ha not been entir unmolest dure it
aeon of exist there ha been develop along with it on of
the most beauti of our butterfli which ha receiv variou
scientif name and the common name of the paint ladi although it
is also often call the thistl butterfli and the cosmopolit which
latter titl perhap is to be prefer thi butterfli howev can
scarc be consid a troublesom enemi of it host plant for it
is seldom suffici abund to injur the thistl appreci the
relat between the two is rather suggest of that mutual
toler by which two live thing develop togeth with advantag
at least to on and without seriou disadvantag to the other the
univers distribut of the food plant ha led to a like
distribut of the butterfli consequ the thistl butterfli ha
long been recogn as the most cosmopolitan speci of it group
see plate page 176
asid from the wide distribut of it food plant and possibl
correl with it through the divers of climat condit under
which the insect ha develop thi butterfli is remark for it
power of flight mani instanc ar known where it ha been taken at
sea long distanc from land thi is due not onli to the propens
of the individu for take arial journei but also to the fact
that thi is on of the butterfli which ha the instinct to
congreg in swarm and to migrat long distanc when thu
congreg in 1879 such a flock start from africa and migrat to
europ
on of the most remark thing about thi butterfli is our
ignor of what it doe with itself in winter american
entomologist ar agre that the adult butterfli hibern but
where it doe so seem not to be known here is an excel
opportun for some young naturalist to go scout hunt in board
pile under loos bark or with a flashlight search the interior
of hollow tree to find between novemb and april live specimen of
thi butterfli such a discoveri would be a real servic to scienc
and should at onc be made known through some scientif journal in
europ there seem to be a belief that the insect hibern partial
at least in the condit of the chrysali
the lifestori
while we mai not know just where the butterfli have been throughout
the winter we do know that in southern new england thei begin to be
seen in field and along roadsid about the middl of mai mani of
the specimen then have a rag appear which is a pretti good
indic that thei came from the chrysali the fall befor and have
been ly conceal through all the week sinc these butterfli
lai their small greenish barrelshap egg on the leav of the
thistl the mother butterfli choos the locat rather carefulli
and deposit onli on egg upon a leaf the butterfli continu thu
to visit flower and to lai egg until about the middl of june when
appar thei perish
about a week after the egg ha thu been laid it hatch into a small
spini caterpillar which doe not take the troubl to devour it egg
shell as so mani other caterpillar do instead it crawl around to
the lower side of the leaf and gnaw off enough of the silken surfac
of the leaf to furnish materi for make a webbi cover the leaf
particl be woven togeth by thread from the caterpillar
mouth in thi wai the littl creatur soon provid itself with a
snug enclosur which serv it as a temporari home it remain in thi
home much of the time when not eat go out occasion to feed
upon the green tissu of the adjac part of the leaf
thi first home of the young caterpillar made as it is as a flat
blanket upon a flat surfac can be us onli by a veri small larva
consequ the caterpillar soon find these quarter too cramp
and it desert them to make a new home with larger space thi second
nest is commonli made on the upper surfac of a leaf the edg of
which ar like to be more or less drawn togeth and other support
connect from other leav or a nearbi stem the caterpillar
continu to us thi nest number two as a place for remain when
not feed and for protect dure the process of moult but
even thi larger nest is like to be given up about the time the
caterpillar becom half grown and a third nest is begun in the upper
part of the plant thi is like to be veri commodi it wall
be made of leav or stem bound togeth by a silken web within
thi the caterpillar complet it growth go out and in through
on or more door when it wish to feed sometim it even remain
within thi nest dure the process of chang to the chrysali
hang downward from the upper part in much the same wai that the
caterpillar of the paint beauti butterfli doe in case it leav
the nest when fulli develop it gener find a place nearbi in
which to pupat
about ten dai after the caterpillar ha chang to a chrysali it
chang again to the adult butterfli in southern new england these
butterfli appear about the middl of juli and lai egg soon
afterward these egg hatch into butterfli that chang to
chrysalid and chang again to butterfli late in august or earli in
septemb thi autumn brood doubtless furnish the butterfli that
will be seen upon the wing the follow mai so that it is pretti
certain that thei must find some shelter in which to pass the
interven month
the fullgrown caterpillar of the thistl butterfli is about on and a
quarter inch long and of a gener yellowish color more or less
mark with blackish as well as with paler line of color there ar
mani transvers row of spine along the segment each yellowish
spine have a circl of smaller on at the top
notwithstand it fond for thistl these caterpillar
occasion feed upon variou other plant on might readili expect
them to be abl to live upon other composit upon which thei ar
found but it seem a bit strang that thei should be record as
be especi fond of mallow
the mourningcloak
vanessa antiopa
on of the most scholarli student of american insect ha happili
call the butterfli the frail children of the air it seem a
fit term for creatur so ether that thei ar readili waft on
the wing of the slightest breez and so delic in structur that
thei ar like to be sadli mutil by the lightest touch of human
hand such creatur on would sai belong to region of perpetu
summer and have no place in the blizzardswept winter of our northern
state
yet if on goe into the snowclad wood dure on of the midwint
thaw on is like to see in everi open glade sever darkcolor
butterfli flit from tree to tree or rest with expand
wing in the sunniest spot these butterfli obvious have endur
the coldest weather and if thei ar to surviv until anoth season
must continu to endur still more thi speci is commonli call
the mourningcloak butterflynot a particularli happi name for so
beauti an insect in england it ha the more suggest titl of
camberwel beauti and countri boi ar said to call it the yellow
edg butterfli it gener lifestori ha alreadi been told on page
112115
the caterpillar of the mourningcloak butterfli ar restrict to
compar few food plant in region where thei ar not
especi abund thei ar like to be found upon willow poplar
or elm in gener as mani observ indic thei ar as like
to be found upon ani on of these food plant as upon either of the
other two but in certain local where thei becom especi
abund it seem that thei ar more like to occur upon the elm on
thi account thei have been call the spini elm caterpillar there
is consider evid to show that thei prefer the american elm to
other speci of the genu although in the case of willow and poplar
there seem to be littl if ani prefer as to the speci
miss carolin g soul ha seen the butterfli deposit their egg
upon the white and cano birch and it ha been record as feed in
labrador and europ upon a speci of birch there is on record of
the caterpillar have been found feed upon the hackberri and
also of their have fed greedili upon the leav of rose bush and
still anoth of their have almost defoli a pear tree linden
and nettl ar also includ in the european list of the food plant
of thi speci see plate page 145 176
it is evid howev that all of these except the three first
namedwillow poplar and elmar to be regard as except
case and that the normal food of the speci is the foliag of a
plant belong to on of these three genera
it ha gener been suppos that thi speci is doublebrood in
central and southern new england the butterfli of the first brood
appear earli in juli these ar said to deposit egg which hatch
into caterpillar that matur into butterfli earli in septemb
these butterfli live through the winter lai egg the follow
spring
it is veri probabl that as far north as southern new hampshir the
speci is commonli singlebrood dure on season when the
caterpillar were unusu abund a veri care watch wa kept
for the second brood in new hampshir and vermont by sever compet
observ onli on coloni of caterpillar wa found and thi wa at
durham in the southern part of new hampshir near the seacoast
consequ it seem safe to conclud that in northern and central
new england at least a singl brood is the rule rather than the
except thi involv the conclus that the butterfli seen upon
the wing earli in autumn ar the same on that develop in juli and
that these same butterfli remain aliv through the winter and until
in the follow mai thei lai their egg thu there is a period of
ten month of exist in the butterfli state an extraordinari
length of time for a butterfli to live
to a larg extent the butterfli disappear in august and the
question aris as to what becom of them our observ lead to
the conclus that thei go into summer quarter similar to those
which thei seek out for winter shelter appar thei fly about for
a few dai after come from the chrysali and then retir to cool
wood where under the side of a log or beneath the loos bark of a
dead tree thei settl down and to all appear go to sleep the
instinct to remain quiet is veri strong in these butterfli in
take the accompani photograph i found that even shortli after
come from the chrysali the butterfli when disturb would fold
their wing with the antenna between them and draw the leg
against the bodi would lie quietli on their side for a long time
these same butterfli would also hang downward from a limb by the
hour in the hibern posit as shown in plate opposit page 32
in the cooler weather of earli autumn the butterfli come from their
retreat and fly about in the sunshin thei ar especi like to
be seen along the border of wood or in open glade at thi time
thei love the sunshin and will settl in a sunni place to bask in it
go into winter quarter
when the warm dai no longer tempt them abroad the mourningcloak
seek shelter in mani sort of situationsund loos bark in hollow
tree under culvert and bridg in woodpil in crevic of rock
or alongsid log ly on the ground in such retreat thei remain
until the sunshin of spring again call them forth
prof g h parker observ indic that these butterfli ar
veri sensit to chang of temperatur and he ha seen the
interest action of the butterfli crawl into their hide
place find that thi take place each dai after thei had been
sun themselv thu he write
these butterfli remain dure cool spring night in place similar
to those in which thei hibern in winter viz in open in
stone wall in old outhous in open under the bark of tree
etc thei retir to these place with consider regular so that
in the open wood where dozen of individu mai have been seen
flit about all mai have disappear a quarter of an hour later i
have watch their retreat with some care on a clear afternoon in
earli april i took my stand in a woodland where mani mourningcloak
butterfli were on the wing thei continu activ fly about
till approxim four oclock when i began to notic a diminut
in their number by a quarter past four not a butterfli wa to be
seen dure the fifteen minut from four oclock on i follow two
to their hide place on alight on the front of a fallen tree and
without expand it wing crept immedi into a larg crack in
the bark the second settl on a stone fenc and crept into a hole
between some loos stone the period dure which thi occur wa
mark not so much by a diminut of light as by a rapid fall of
temperatur
that the habit of lethargi in cold and of rest upon the bark of
tree is practic univers with thi speci is shown by a
statement quot by h g adam in hi book beauti butterfli
publish in england in 1871 the writer quot sai in a wood on
the summit of the drachenfel when the wind wa rather keen i found
number rest on the back of fallen tree in a state of stupor
thei made no attempt to escap and when thrown into the air their
wing bare open or flap feebli eas their fall or enabl
them to seek repos on the stem of a rotten trunk
it rariti in england
in mani book thi speci is spoken of by it english name camberwel
beauti it is so call becaus it wa first observ in the
neighborhood of camberwel in the counti of surrei england it seem
that in that countri it is a veri rare speci thi is a bit curiou
consid the fact that in america it is so extrem abund in
hi attract littl book quot abov mr adam begin the
discuss of thi speci with thi statement thi is the crown
glori of the british butterfli collector cabinet and a happi man is
he who get a perfect specimen of an insect which is at onc so rare
and so beauti and later in the same discuss is thi further
statement concern the scarciti of the speci in neither the
larva nor the pupa state ha the insect been found we believ in
thi countri where it appear occur except just here and there a
singl specimen or two at long and uncertain interv about eighti
year ago it wa seen in mani part of the kingdom and again in 1819
but not sinc then although almost everi year on or more specimen
ar taken or seen
a curiou fact in regard to the mourningcloak as found in england
is that the border around the wing seem to be much more gener
white than it is with us j o westwood in hi book on british
butterfli describ the margin as of a white or whitish color and
other writer speak of the same fact kirbi in hi butterfli and
moth make thi compar statement the border is whitest in
british specimen and perhap yellowest in american on he speak
of it also as on of the rarest british speci it is sometim
call by the common name the white border and also occasion the
grand surpris appel which bear out what ha been said abov
both in regard to the color of the border and the rariti of the
insect

the mourningcloak
caterpillar chrysali and butterfli
the mourningcloak subsist upon a consider varieti of liquid food
which thei suck through their long tongu in spring when thei first
come from their winter quarter thei visit the stump of recent cut
tree and suck the exud sap a habit which thei continu whenev
opportun offer mr w f fisk ha notic that thei commonli sip
the sap of mapl twig where the squirrel have gnaw the bark a
littl later thei visit the willow catkin to suck the nectar secret
by these blossom and still later thei hover about the delic
blossom of the mayflow or trail arbutu for a similar purpos
probabl mani other flower ar thu rifl of their sweet although
thi butterfli seem to be a less regular visitor to flower than ar
mani of it alli a littl later when the aphid or plantlic
have becom suffici abund so that the socal honei dew is
to be found upon the infest shrub these mourningcloak sometim
sip the liquid sweet from the surfac of the leav in april and mai
thei occasion visit the flower of moosewood and later in the
season have been observ upon the blossom of the common milkwe
from the time the earli appl ripen these butterfli mai often be
seen beneath the orchard tree sip the liquid of the fallen and
decai fruit
the parasit of the egg
on fine spring morn i came upon a mourningcloak deposit a
cluster of egg upon a willow twig she wa so busili engag that i
wa abl to draw near and watch the oper for some time befor she
flew awai as soon as she wa gone i wa much interest to see a tini
parasit fly run eagerli over the newli laid egg and thi fly
also wa so busili interest in her work that i wa abl to cut the
twig off and sit down to observ at leisur through a len the action
of the insect i dictat to a companion my note of these
observ and so wa abl to get rather a complet record of the
process of oviposit
the tini fly would stop over on of the butterfli egg hold it
bodi vertic with the hind leg far back and the other leg so
straighten out as to hold the front of the bodi high up then it
would insert it tini ovipositor through the egg shell and proce to
deposit an egg of it own insid of the larger egg of the butterfli
at least it seem a safe assumpt that thi wa what happen
although of cours it wa imposs to see the smaller egg at the
time while thu engag the antenna of the tini fly were bent
directli downward to the egg beneath in about a minut the fly
withdrew it ovipositor and after run around for a few second
again settl upon anoth egg and repeat the oper then it
tri again on a third egg after which i got out my watch and began
time the process these ar the result in the case of the next
dozen egg that were laid it requir
94 sec to lai egg no 4 then fly move around 26 sec

it thu requir an averag of about two minut per egg for the
lai of these fifteen egg i then caught the littl fly and sent
her to dr l o howard our greatest author on thi group of
insect to learn the name of the parasit he identifi it as
telenomu grapta a wellknown parasit of the egg of the
mourningcloak and relat butterfli
the most interest thing about thi observ wa the fact that
the littl fly had appar begun it oper befor the mother
butterfli had finish lai her cluster of egg there were
thousand of willow twig in the immedi vicin how did thi tini
creatur arriv at thi particular place at the particular moment when
from it own point of view it wa most need had it been ride
around upon the bodi of the butterfli wait for the time when she
should lai the egg or wa it attract to them from somewher in the
immedi vicin that thi earli arriv probabl take place
gener is indic by the fact that a similar observ had been
made in the white mountain by prof c w woodworth
the histori of the egg parasit after the lai of the egg seem to
be compar simpl it soon hatch into a tini larva that
develop within the shell at the expens of the content it final
chang to a pupa which in turn chang to the littl fly that gnaw a
hole through the egg shell and emerg to the outer world
the parasit of the caterpillar
after hatch from the egg the mourningcloak caterpillar ar also
subject to the attack of variou parasit on of these is quit
minut not a great deal larger than the egg parasit it is a tini
fourwing fly which deposit mani egg in a singl caterpillar the
egg hatch into tini maggot that grow at the expens of the
caterpillar final kill it and chang to fourwing fli
again as mani as 145 of these parasit have been known to emerg
from a singl dead caterpillar these littl fli ar call chalcid
by entomologist
there is still anoth group of fourwing fli some of which
attack the antiopa caterpillar these ar much larger than the
chalcid fli and ar call ichneumon fli in the case of these
onli on or two parasit develop in each caterpillar or chrysali
in addit to these variou fourwing fli there ar certain
twowing fli call tachinid fli that develop at the expens
of the caterpillar in new hampshir dure recent year these
appear to have been the most abund parasit of these insect an
egg is laid on the skin of the caterpillar by a twowing fly
similar in gener appear to the figur below the content of
thi egg shortli develop into a tini grub that burrow through the egg
shell and the skin of the caterpillar into the insid of the bodi
here it remain absorb the bodi substanc of it host and
gradual increas in size in a few week it becom fulli
develop in thi grub state by thi time the caterpillar ha becom
sluggish from the effect of the parasit if the branch upon which it
feed is disturb the other caterpillar ar like to crawl awai
but the enfeebl victim remain in it place
illustr tachinid parasit slightli magnifi
shortli after becom full grown the tachinid grub break through
the skin of the dy caterpillar and fall to the ground chang
to a peculiar pupa the outer skin of the grub turn brown and becom
hard form a protect cover for the bodi insid a week or two
later the insect undergo anoth chang and emerg as a twowing
tachinid fly like the on that laid the egg some week befor
other enemi
besid those insect that develop on the insid of the bodi of
these antiopa caterpillar there ar other insect enemi which attack
them from the outsid and devour them bodili the most notabl of
these perhap is a larg beetl commonli call the caterpillar
hunter it is known to entomologist as calosoma scrutat thi is
a veri activ insect with larg strong jaw that run rapidli about
in search of victim in some case it ha been observ while
destroi mani of the antiopa larva
in the southern state a common reddish waspa speci of
polistesha also been observ attack these caterpillar and
there ar probabl variou other insect that destroi them although
definit observ show thi have not been record
the antiopa caterpillar ar such spini creatur that compar
few bird attack them thei ar devour howev by the two speci
of cuckoosth yellowbil and blackbilledand it is probabl
that thei ar sometim kill by baltimor oriol and variou other
bird thei ar also greedili devour by toad but of cours thei do
not often come within the reach of these us anim
even the adult butterfli of thi speci have to be on the lookout
for enemi dure the long month of their life mani of them
probabl succumb to the attack of bird or other creatur i have
seen but on such tragedi while ride along a countri highwai with a
birdlov friend on spring dai we saw a male maryland yellowthroat
flit by with a mourningcloak in hi mouth the bird lit on a fenc
from which i startl him so that he drop the butterfli a worn and
fade halfdead specimen the place where the bird held the insect
were indic by miss piec of the wing
the american tortoiseshel
aglai milberti
thi beauti butterfli is on of the most distinct of all our
speci it is of moder size it wing rare expand more than
two inch and it ha suffici irregular outlin to indic it
relationship with the anglew the most strike featur of the
upper surfac is the broad band of orangebrown extend clear across
both wing a littl insid the border the remain surfac is a
darker brown mark with two orangebrown spot near the front margin
of each front wing and have scatter iridesc scale which show
plainli under a len the suggest of the color of a
tortoiseshel is easili seen in these rich brown tone the under
surfac is a wonder illustr of protect color with wing
close and rest against the bark of tree or ly beneath the
tree among fallen leav it would requir a keen ey to detect the
insect see plate page 160161
the american tortoiseshel is distinctli a northern speci north of
latitud fortythre degre it seem to occur practic from ocean
to ocean extend far up toward the arctic region it is commonli
found in british america as far north as fort simpson in latitud
sixtyon degre there ar specimen in the british museum collect
by the explor ross in arctic america and there ar mani in our own
nation museum collect in the hudson bai region by variou american
explor in new england the speci is abund at time in new
hampshir vermont and main in the vicin of new york citi and
buffalo new york it is rather rare and south of thi latitud it is
found chiefli at the higher elev in mountain district as a
rule it is like to vari in number from year to year sometim
be extrem abund while more commonli it is rather rare these
ar the same sort of fluctuat that we find in the case of the
mourningcloak the american tent caterpillar and variou other
insect whose larva live in coloni the variat is probabl due
to the fact that when the caterpillar becom unusu abund thei
becom correspondingli conspicu and so provid a shine mark that
is soon discov by their insect enemi or by variou fungou
diseas
the stori of it life
in it manner of lai egg thi butterfli differ from most other
the great major of our familiar speci lai their egg on in a
place or possibl two or three near togeth some speci deposit
sever in a group while some like the mourningcloak mai lai two
or three dozen in a cluster veri few howev deposit hundr in a
bunch two of these ar the baltimor and thi american
tortoiseshel in the case of the latter the egg ar loos laid
hundr togeth upon the leav of the common sting nettl
probabl each femal can deposit six or eight hundr egg in less
than a week the egg hatch into minut blackish caterpillar that feed
upon the tender tissu of the leaf upon which thei were born and then
migrat togeth toward the top of the plant in their habit thei ar
quit similar to the caterpillar of the mourningcloak as each walk
it spin from it mouth a silken thread and the combin effect of
hundr of these thread is to make a notic silken web over the
leav the caterpillar remain in coloni feed togeth from dai
to dai and gradual denud the upper branch of the nettl plant
leav an unsightli silken web as a memento of their presenc thi
web is veri suggest of the similar result left behind by a
coloni of mourningcloak caterpillar upon the twig of elm or poplar
when about half grown these caterpillar ar like to scatter more or
less in accident group which mai make small shelter tent from the
larger leav in each littl nest there mai be four or five or more
of the darkcolor caterpillar from these shelter tent thei salli
forth to feed upon the adjac leav and a littl later becom full
grown as caterpillar each now wander awai and find such shelter
as it is abl to spin a button of silk and becom a chrysali it
remain in thi condit but a short time befor it emerg again as
the beauti butterfli
thi speci is commonli reput to have three brood a year
hibern both as a butterfli and as a chrysali it ha been
suggest howev by mr w f fisk on of our most painstak
entomologist who ha studi the butterfli of new hampshir for
mani year that it is more probabl doublebrood with a period of
aestiv dure the later week of summer thi seem a veri
probabl condit and it is to be hope that some observ will make
such a care studi of thi speci as to settl the point
definit
in the case of mani butterfli the distribut of the speci
coincid with the distribut of the food plant thi american
tortoiseshel howev is perhap the except that mai prove the
rule for it southward limit is far north of the southern rang of
the sting nettl evid it is a speci which ha develop in
adjust to the cool climat of northern region or high altitud
and it doe not easili adapt itself to a warmer territori
the whitej butterfli or compton tortois
eugonia jalbum
dure bright dai in march and april on is like to find two kind
of butterfli on the wing in open glade of the wood on is the
familiar mourningcloak and the other is the compton tortoiseth
latter gener much less abund than the former both make the
most of the brief period of sunshin and quickli disappear when the
sky is overcast
the compton tortois butterfli which ar thu abroad in earli spring
have been in hibern sinc octob thei ar help to carri the
speci over from on season to anoth and as the dai becom longer
and warmer thei appear on the wing more and more seek such liquid
food as the field and forest yield dure the dai of earli spring
the sap exud from hole in bark made by woodpeck or from the
tap of the mapl tree by man the nectar of willow catkin the
moistur of roadsid poolsthes help to yield a precari
susten to these butterfli after their long winter fast thei
remain upon the wing week after week while spring slowli progress
in the northern region thei inhabit when at last the leav push out
on their food treeswillow birch and elmth femal lai their
egg and then have live to what for a butterfli is a ripe old ag
thei die after nearli ten month of adult exist
appar the egg ar laid in cluster on the twig although thi
seem to be on of the mani fact about butterfli await
observ by some care student the caterpillar feed togeth in
small coloni but make no nest thei becom full grown in about a
month thei ar then nearli two inch long with spinou greenish
bodi stripe with lighter line some chang to chrysalid about
the middl of june and ten dai later chang again to butterfli the
first of which appear earli in juli while other continu to emerg
for nearli a month
these butterfli mai be seen rather frequent from midsumm on
visit variou flower and sip the juic from decai fruit
beneath the tree at time thei seem to disappear in august to
reappear in octob a fact which ha led some observ to suggest
that there is a second brood the caterpillar of thi brood howev
have never been observ and a much more probabl explan ha been
made by mr w f fisk who studi the butterfli of new hampshir
carefulli for mani year he found that in the hot summer weather thi
butterfli goe into a seclus similar to that of it winter
restthat is it aestiv in summer and hibern in winter the
possibl that the octob jalbum did not repres a second
brood write mr fisk wa render almost a certainti by repeat
observ which fail to disclos a singl specimen approxim
in fresh to averag august individu and the question of their
whereabout dure the interim wa unexpectedli answer on warm
august dai by my find sever snugli pack awai under the shingl
on an old roof the theori of the aestiv of the butterfli of
thi group will explain a good mani point hitherto obscur in the
life histori of the other speci
in octob these butterfli seek their winter quarter find them
in wood and grove appar thei commonli rest upon the bark of
the trunk as well as crawl into such crevic beneath loos bark as
thei can find here thei remain through fall winter and spring
except when call into brief period of activ by the unwont
warmth of the winter sunshin then in spring thei come forth again to
lai the egg for the caterpillar of the new gener
the fresh butterfli ar creatur of exquisit modul color
the name compton tortois ha refer to the rich brown tone of the
upper wing surfac suggest of those of fine tortoiseshel in
fresh specimen much of the surfac especi in the middl and
along the front border is overlaid with iridesc purpl scale
near the front outer angl of each of the four wing there is a
distinct white spot divid near the middl by a darker line of the
vein run through it the under surfac is on of the best exampl
of mimicri of grai bark to be found in ani butterfli the tone vari
consider in differ individu but in all the protect must
be well nigh perfect when the insect is at rest with close wing upon
the bark of a tree the strike angular of the wing border
doubtless help to conceal it and the habit of drop motionless to
the ground when disturb must also have protect valu near the
middl of each hind wing there is a small white j which led to the
specif name jalbum
thi butterfli is essenti a member of the canadian fauna it
rang from far north in labrador british america and alaska south
as far as pennsylvania but toward it southern limit it occur onli
on the higher elev of mountain like the alleghani
the buckey
junonia coenia
some genera of butterfli seem to belong almost exclus to the
north temper region seldom occur even in our southern state
other belong equal exclus to tropic region seldom
strai into the north the buckey is an illustr of the latter
group the genu junonia to which it belong is essenti tropic
as it contain sever speci which ar found throughout the tropic
in both the old and the new world in fact thi is appar the
onli speci which occur north of the tropic it ha an
extraordinari rang be found from cuba to massachusett and from
the atlant to the pacif coast toward the northern limit of it
rang it is veri rare and on of the greatest prize which the
collector can obtain in our southern state it is an abund and
gener distribut butterfli and as it hibern as an adult and
on group follow anoth throughout the season rather rapidli it is
like to be taken at almost ani time see plate page 176
the mother butterfli select as food plant for the larva variou
member of either the plantain or figwort famili thei lai egg on
in a place upon the leav of plantain figwort gerardia and
relat plant gener near the tip of the leav less than a week
later these hatch into spini caterpillar which feed upon the green
substanc of the leav dure the next few week for the most part
thei eat between the vein leav a rag effect which mai help in
find them when full grown thei chang to chrysalid which hang
straight downward and bear a gener resembl to those of the
thistl butterfli curious enough those chrysalid which ar
attack by parasit take on a characterist golden hue although
the normal healthi chrysalid ar dark brown with a few touch of a
decidedli lighter brown
in it tropic home where there is no winter period to interrupt it
growth thi butterfli doubtless continu to develop gener
after gener without ani break in the sequenc as the speci
goe north howev there is necessarili such an interruptionin
which case the winter seem commonli to be pass by the adult
butterfli in our southern state there ar commonli three or four
brood each year while in the northern part of it rang there is

the tribe of the sovereign
no other small group of american butterfli ha attract so much

butterfli with round wing which ar found in on speci or
anoth over practic the whole of north america some of them ar
of exceed beauti and all of them present lifehistori of
extraordinari interest at least two of the speci ar the most
notabl exampl of the mimicri of other butterfli that ar shown in
our fauna thei also present some extrem interest problem for
the studi of natur hybrid and thei illustr in their develop
some of the most wonder case of adapt to environ that
have ever been found

the stage of the viceroi
the butterfli freshli emerg caterpillar hung up for
pupat the chrysali the caterpillar feed
these butterfli mai be consid from so mani interest point of
view that it is a bit difficult to know which phase to emphas in
gener there is a strike similar in their structur and habit
in the earlier stage the egg ar veri nearli alik the
caterpillar resembl on anoth so close that even expert
entomologist sometim have to decid what speci a collect
caterpillar belong to by see what plant it is feed upon and
the chrysalid ar also veri similar
some of the more interest phase in the develop of these
insect ar discuss in connect with the lifestori of the
differ speci a phase which is characterist to all of them mai
well be emphas here from the time the caterpillar hatch until
thei chang to chrysalid thei illustr to a mark degre an
adapt through structur and habit which must veri larg protect
them from attack by bird and other enemi their structur and
mark ar almost grotesqu the bodi is cover with strang
clublik appendag and it is color with a curiou mottl of
tone of green drab brown and white which is veri difficult to
describ but which suggest as the caterpillar rest upon rough bark
simpli a bit of bird dung or some natur excresc the
caterpillar have the habit of feed at night and remain upon
their perch by dai often assum posit which ar veri unusu
among insect larva such posit in which thei remain motionless
for hour at a time ar undoubtedli of protect valu and help to
conceal the insect after the caterpillar ar half grown thei rest
not upon the leav upon which thei feed but rather upon the bark of
twig or branch where their peculiar structur is like to make
them inconspicu
the chrysalid of the sovereign ar also curious mottl in color
tone that will probabl lead to their be overlook
three distinct speci of sovereign ar found in eastern north
america name
the viceroi basilarchia archippu
the band purpl basilarchia arthemi
the redspot purpl basilarchia astyanax
the first speci the viceroi ha a much wider distribut than
either of the other it appar is found in nearli all local
in which either of these occur and so includ within it rang
almost the whole of the unit state and much of canada
the second of these the band purpl is a northern form it is
found commonli at least as far north as the mackenzi river region in
british america and southward to central massachusett it also occur
as far west as nebraska so that it ha a veri wide distribut in
northern region it is especi abund in canada and the white
mountain
the third the redspot purpl is the characterist form south of
latitud 42 degre it rang overlap that of the band purpl for
about on degre but it is seldom found north of latitud 42 degre
it seem to rang about as far west as the band purpl
there ar sever other butterfli belong to thi genu which ar
rare found and which occur onli in certain limit region there
ha been much discuss in regard to these some entomologist have
thought them simpli varieti or dimorph form while other have
consid them hybrid an analysi of the condit show that
these doubt butterfli occur onli in region where the differ
speci overlap thu in the boundari connect the band purpl
and the redspot purpl there ar form which resembl these two
speci in such a wai as to suggest that these ar the parent of the
hybrid in local where the viceroi and the band purpl occur
there ar other form which seem to connect these two speci and in
the local where the viceroi and the redspot purpl occur there
ar still other form which seem to suggest these as the parent so
the evid seem pretti conclus that where these butterfli
overlap there ar like to be occasion cross between the speci
which result in these natur hybrid
in the far western state there ar certain other speci of
basilarchia which take the place of the eastern form on of the most
abund of these on the pacif coast is sometim call lorquin
admir b lorquini in florida there is anoth speci b
floridensi which is found in the southern state it is the onli
on whose color resembl that of the viceroi
the viceroi
basilarchia archippu
the common name of thi butterfli wa probabl given it in allus to
it resembl to the monarch butterfli for the monarch and the
viceroi have been close associ in the mind of mani observ
ever sinc peopl began to studi butterfli in america these two
insect have becom famou as the most notabl exampl that we have
of the mimick of on butterfli by anoth accord to the theori
which ha been held by mani naturalist the monarch is distast to
bird and other anim and it advertis the fact by it bright
combin of brown and black the monarch is thu an exampl of what
ha often been call warn color on the other hand the
viceroi is commonli suppos to have no objection tast when eaten
by bird but it so close resembl the monarch in it color pattern
and it habit of flight that it ha been assum that bird would not
touch it becaus of it resembl to the distast butterfli
there ha howev recent been a reaction among naturalist in
regard to the valid of mani suppos exampl of warn color
and the whole subject is still open to care investig see
cover and plate page 145
whether the viceroi deserv it celebr as an insect mimic or not
it is well worthi of studi for other reason it is a common and
attract butterfli and it ha most interest habit in the larval
state it is found over a larg part of north america and fli freeli
from spring until autumn over meadow field and open glade
the yearli cycl of life
to trace the yearli cycl of thi butterfli life let us begin with
on of the mother insect flit along a stream in earli summer she
stop now and then to lai an egg on the tip of a leaf on a willow or
poplar she then continu on her wai occasion sip nectar from
ani earli flower she mai chanc to find and continu her leisur
life perhap for sever week
the egg thu laid upon the poplar leaf remain in posit for a week
or more unless it should be devour by some wander ant or
discov by some tini parasit if it escap these danger it
hatch into a minut caterpillar that escap from the egg shell
through a hole in it side after it ha come out it turn around and
eat the remaind of the shell it then begin feed upon the
tender tissu of the leaf it is rest upon nibbl at the side
until it appetit is satisfi then it retir to the midrib on the
lower surfac where it remain quietli through the dai and thereaft
feed chiefli at night after about a week it becom too larg for
the skin with which it wa born so it moult and immedi devour
it cast skin it continu these oper of feed and moult
at occasion interv for sever week final becom a rather
larg and curiou look caterpillar mottl in greenish oliv and
light grai with two larg hornlik project from the front of the
bodi
it final becom full grown in thi larval state then it spin a
web of silk upon the bark of the twig and entangl the hook claw
of it hind leg in the silken web it thu hang downward until the
larval skin is shuffl off and the curiou pupa with the conspicu
hump upon the middl of it back remain in it place thi chrysali
is of a mottl color veri similar to that of the caterpillar a
week or so later the chrysali skin break open and the butterfli
come out catch hold of the twig with it leg and hang quietli
in posit while it wing expand
the butterfli of thi brood ar like to appear late in summer it
is the second brood of adult butterfli for the season these insect
have the same leisur habit as those that were on the wing earlier
in the season in a similar wai the mother butterfli lai their egg
on the leav of willow and poplar and these egg soon hatch into
young caterpillar that look like those that hatch in earli summer
the caterpillar howev of thi autumn brood have a most
interest habit which wa entir lack in those of earli summer
soon after hatch thei begin to make for themselv littl hous in
which to pass the winter thi is veri cleverli done by util part
of the leaf upon which thei ar feed each side of the leaf toward
it tip is eaten off with the midrib remain untouch then the
lower half of the leaf which ha not been eaten is roll into a tube
and secur sew togeth with silken thread the stem of the leaf
is also cover with a similar silken web and secur fasten to the
twig in such a wai that it is imposs for the leaf to fall off when
the other leav do the littl caterpillar thu cleverli provid
itself with a safe winter home into which it retreat on the approach
of cold weather to remain until spring thei enter these littl case
head first and appar seldom emerg again until the warm spring
sun bring them forth to feed upon the develop willow catkin or
the unfold leav
the caterpillar that thu pass the winter in these pitcherlik case
ar perhap a third grown thei develop rapidli in spring and ar
like to us the case for rest purpos when thei ar not
feed after a few week thei becom fullgrown caterpillar and
chang to chrysalid to chang again a littl later into the
butterfli that appear in earli summer there ar thu two brood of
each stage of the insect dure the year
curiou caterpillar habit
thi brief summari of the yearli histori of the viceroi is by no mean
adequ as a stori of the mani interest thing to be told about
thi insect which ha been carefulli studi by sever emin
naturalist on of these is the strang habit the veri young
caterpillar have of fasten a few bit of leaf togeth by mean of
silken thread and then ty the bunch to the denud rib of the
leaf to explain thi allow me to quot from an admir essai of
the late samuel h scudder whose studi of butterfli have ad so
much to our knowledg of these beauti creatur
soon after birth wrote mr scudder when it ha eaten but a veri
few swath down the leaf the littl fellow construct a small and
loos packet from minut bit of leaf and other rejectamenta loos
fasten to on anoth and to the midrib close to but scarc
touch the eaten edg of the leaf and as fast as the leaf is eaten
it remov thi packet continu ad to until it becom almost
as big as a small pea farther and farther down the midrib awai from
it perch alwai keep it near the eaten edg it should be note
that it is so loos attach the bit of leaf at all possibl
angl that it is move by the least breath meanwhil the
caterpillar ha been grow larger and more conspicu and thu in
greater peril from it enemi there ar two possibl servic that
thi odd packet mai render a spider wander over a leaf and
observ it motion mai seiz it and think it ha a prize hurri
awai with it and leav it architect unharm thi seem to me rather
a strain suggest for a wander spider would probabl proce
to investig it on the spot anoth explan seem more
probabl it should be rememb that the leav prefer by these
creatur as food ar mostli such as ar easili shaken by the wind
and as the caterpillar move with the leaf and with all the
surround leav in a continu flutter in the case of the
trembl aspen and to a less degre in the other food plant thi
of itself is a protect to it as it would more readili escap
observ as an object distinct from the leav all be in motion
togeth but on the more stabl leav like the willow the motion
in a feebl wind would not be suffici to be servic and here
at least the packet come into plai an object in motion among other
at rest is a notic thing a fact well recogn among anim
as a host of them show when thei fear be seen thi packet attach
by loos silken thread move as state with a breath of wind and
so would distract attent from it architect near by who ha taken
pain to place it at the farthest remov from hi perch while still
to avoid undesir step on hi daili track if thi be realli it
object it is sure on of the oddest devic in natur
the curiou winter case of the viceroi were first carefulli describ
by the late dr c v rilei in on of hi classic report on the
insect of missouri it is on of the best account which ha ever
been written and is well worth quot at some length
the larva of the autumn brood wrote doctor rilei when about
on fourth or on third grown build for themselv curiou littl
hous in which thei pass the winter first and foremostwith wise
forethought and be well awar through it natur instinct that
the leaf which it ha collect for it hous will fall to the ground
when the cold weather set in unless it take measur to prevent
thisth larva fasten the stem of the leaf with silken cabl
secur to the twig from which it grow it then gnaw off the blade
of the leaf at it tip end leav littl els but the midrib
final it roll the remain part of the blade of the leaf into a
cylind sew the edg togeth with silk the basal portion of
the cylind is of cours taper to a point as the edg of the leaf
ar nearli drawn togeth not overlap and invari the lower
side of the leaf form the outsid of the hous so as to have the
project midrib out of the wai of the larva as it repos snugli on
the insid the whole when finish ha somewhat the appear of
the leaf of a miniatur pitcherpl sarracenia it length
be 5065 inch and it diamet 1114 inch
these curiou littl case mai be commonli found upon our willow and
poplar in the winter time i have examin hundr of them and
although thei ar invari built upon thi plan thei vari greatli
in the degre of perfect which the architect attain and thi is
especi the case where thei have been built in confin the
blade on the tip piec is sometim gnaw off right down to the rib
at other it is left almost as broad as the tube sometim it is bent
over the orific at other not thei ar also much more irregular and
ungainli when made with broad leav such as those of the silver
poplar than when made from the more narrow leav of the willow tree
these autumn larva have also anoth peculiar habit thei exhibit a
tendenc to build from the time thei ar hatch and will alwai eat
the leav from the side gnaw larg hole and cut along the
side of the midrib thei commenc at the tip and as thei work
downward toward the base thei collect the dbri into a littl bunch
which thei fasten with silk to the midrib when the hibernaculum is
finish the seam is perfectli smooth and the hole insid is line
with silk the larva have complet it work compos itself for
the winter with the hind end toward the orific here it remain till
the catkin ar in bloom the next spring when it retreat from it
hous and commenc feed not the least wonder part of thi
phenomenon is that it is onli the autumn brood of larva that form
pitcherlik hous to live in dure the inclement season of the
yearth summer brood have no occas to shelter themselv from
cold it is an interest fact that in most northern region these
winter case ar nearli alwai made so near the ground that thei ar
protect by snow dure most of the winter
when an insect ha such a curiou habit as that of make these winter
case it seem compar easi to explain it as an acquir
instinct brought about through the condit of life dure the long
period in which success gener have been laid but as doctor
rilei seem to suggest abov it is much more difficult to explain
thi sort of phenomenon when it occur onli in on of two or more
brood dure the season
the band purpl
basilarchia arthemi
none of our common butterfli show more strike color mark than
the band purpl a broad white stripe run midwai through the wing
on both surfac the white make a strong contrast to the purplish
or brownish black of the rest of the wing thi white band is
supplement by row of fulvou and of blue dot especi on both
surfac of the hind wing
thi butterfli is a northern form rang to a larg extent north of
the region occupi by the viceroi it lifehistori is veri similar
to that of the latter insect the caterpillar have the same curiou
habit and bear a close gener resembl to on anoth the band
purpl butterfli appear in june and lai their egg in juli upon the
tip of the leav of birch especi the black birch almost all
of these egg ar laid within two or three feet of the ground thei
ar of grayish green color the caterpillar ar greenish or
olivebrown
about a week after the egg is laid it hatch into a small caterpillar
that feed upon the side of the leaf and rest upon the midrib just
as the viceroi caterpillar doe it continu to feed through juli and
the earli part of august moult onc or twice befor it begin to
form the winter case it usual goe into thi dure the latter part
of august when it is in the second or third caterpillar stage from
then on it remain quietli in it winter home be cover by the
deep snow dure sever month and come out about the middl of
the follow mai when the spring warmth start the bud of it food
plant it then feed for two or three week befor it chang to a
chrysali to emerg in june as a butterfli there seem to be normal
but on brood each year although under except condit some of
the egg laid in juli matur into butterfli the same season but it
is probabl that these butterfli either do not lai egg and perish
as the cold come on or that if thei do lai egg the caterpillar
that hatch from them do not get larg enough to construct their winter
case consequ it is doubt if we can consid the insect
realli twobrood even in part
the redspot purpl
basilarchia astyanax
were it not for the wonder iridesc of it wing the redspot
purpl would be on of the most plainli mark of the sovereign but
the upper surfac of both pair of wing is thickli cover with
iridesc scale which give the insect a shimmer beauti that make
it conspicu among northern butterfli suggest someth of the
marvel color of the larg tropic speci the gener color
is a purplish black with row of white dot along the border of the
wing the under surfac show much more of the fulvou brown which is
so characterist of the viceroi the brownish background be rather
thinli overlaid with iridesc scale but with a larg number of
spot and stripe where the fulvou color alon show
the favorit food plant of thi speci belong to the great order
rosacea which includ the appl pear cherri rose and mani
other common tree and shrub the egg is laid upon the extrem tip of
the leaf a characterist habit of all the speci of basilarchia it
obvious must have decid advantag in preserv the egg from
attack by ant spider ichneumon fli and other enemi all of
these creatur ar constantli patrol leaf surfac in search of
egg and minut insect thei ar much more like to find their
victim upon the broad gener surfac than upon the extrem tip of
narrowli point leav the egg of all these butterfli ar small
and pit much like a tini littl honeycomb with a larg number of
tini hair aris from the surfac these hair ar veri similar to
the hair upon the surfac of mani leav and thei probabl assist in
lead other insect to overlook the egg yet notwithstand these
devic for protect it remain true that a larg proport of the
egg ar attack by tini parasit and probabl mani other ar eaten
by ant and spider thi veri fact emphas the necess of such
protect featur as the lai of on egg in a place upon the tip
of a leaf and the hairi cover on the egg shell
a few dai after the egg ar laid each hatch into a small
caterpillar that immedi begin feed upon the green tissu
besid itfirst howev devour the empti egg shell it doe not
eat the midrib of the leaf but util it as a perch gener
wind it more or less with silken thread appar to make it
stronger and to prevent it from curl up the caterpillar seem to
feed chiefli at night rest quietli by dai after a week or so it
moult and then continu feed as befor it continu to feed and
grow for sever week moult regularli until it becom full fed
as a caterpillar it then spin a web of silk close upon the bark of
twig or branch or possibl upon some other object near at hand in
thi web it entangl the hook claw of it hind leg and hang
downward preparatori to the chang to the chrysali soon afterward
the last larval skin is shed and the chrysali hang in place of the
caterpillar thi chrysali ha the characterist form of all the
member of thi limit group the outer skin be well harden and
there be a veri promin project on the middl of the back
the chrysali hang thu buffet more or less by wind and rain for
about ten dai then the skin break apart and the butterfli emerg
over a larg part of it rang there ar two brood of thi butterfli
each year the adult appear in earli summer and lai egg which
develop into butterfli again dure the latter part of summer the
lifehistori of thi gener is the on describ in the last
paragraph the egg laid by these late summer butterfli howev
requir a somewhat differ stori thei hatch in the same wai as the
other but when the caterpillar have moult about twice thei form a
winter case or hibernaculum in exactli the same wai as the
caterpillar of the viceroi thei remain within these winter home
till the follow spring when thei come forth and complet their
develop produc the earli summer brood of butterfli with which

the chrysali b is suggest of that of the monarch butterfli
it is light green cover with whitish granul
the adult butterfli is remark for the falcat shape of the outer
margin of each front wing and the broad tail at the hind outer angl
of each hind wing in the male the upper surfac of all the wing is
of a dark orang tone with a rather narrow brown margin mark in
the femal thi margin band is broader and is nearli parallel by
anoth narrow band a littl nearer the bodi in bright sunshin
there is a distinct purplish red iridesc over practic the
whole upper surfac the under side of both wing is of a color to
suggest a dead brown leaf with a purplish iridesc in certain
angl of light
the grai emperor

thi veri distinct mediums butterfli is found in the southern

like the tawni emperor thi speci feed in the larval state upon the
leav of hackberri in missouri the butterfli appear in june a
littl later thei lai egg upon the under side of the hackberri
leav commonli on in a place but sometim sever side by side a
few dai later these egg hatch into littl yellow caterpillar that
feed upon the leav for about a month when thei becom full grown
thei ar then a littl more than an inch long of a gener light
green color with yellow spot along the middl of the back and three
yellow line along each side the head ha a pair of curiou antler
much like those of the caterpillar of the tawni emperor these
caterpillar now spin a bit of silken web on the under side of the
leaf or twig thei attach their hind leg into thi web and hang
downward for a dai or two befor cast the last larval skin and
chang to chrysalid thei chang again to butterfli which ar
seen upon the wing earli in august these butterfli lai egg in turn
on the hackberri leav the egg soon hatch into small
caterpillar which accord to rilei observ ar less activ
than those of the earlier brood these caterpillar feed for a few
week until thei becom nearli half grown and have pass their second
or possibl their third moult thei now stop eat and get readi for
a long fast through the winter appar some of them at least
attach themselv to the under side of the hackberri leav and turn
to a brownish color remain upon the leav until the latter fall
to the ground and presum hibern in the shelter thu provid
whether or not all of the caterpillar have thi rather curiou habit
seem to be doubt it ha been suggest that some of them find
shelter within the crevic in the rough bark of the tree at ani
rate the caterpillar remain in a sort of stupor until the follow

feed upon the young leav thei continu thi until thei becom
full grown in mai when thei chang to chrysalid to emerg as the
first brood of butterfli the follow month mani of the
caterpillar make a sort of nest for themselv by spin a web of
silk upon the under surfac of the leaf and draw togeth slightli
the outer edg
as is the case with so mani other butterfli that hibern as
caterpillar appar the speci is onli partial doublebrood
some of the earlier caterpillar becom letharg when half grown and
remain in that condit throughout the later week of summer and all
through the fall and winter
the tawni emperor
chloripp clyton
thi handsom butterfli is easili distinguish from the grai emperor
by the gener reddish color of the wing which ar thickli mark
with band and eyespot of darker brown or black the eyespot ar
especi mark on the hind wing there be a row of five of these
on each hind wing in both sex the femal ar decidedli larger than
the male and gener of a distinctli lighter color
thi butterfli is a southern speci found more or less abundantli
from southern new york to northern florida and across the countri to a
line drawn from iowa to texa it seem to be more common in the
mississippi vallei than in other region and it lifehistori wa
first thoroughli work out in missouri and publish in on of
rilei classic report on the insect of that state it ha sinc
been studi by edward and other but even now there seem to be
some uncertainti in regard to mani point in it develop notabl
the number of brood in differ local and the habit of the
larva when prepar for hibern
the princip point in the lifehistori of the speci mai be
outlin as follow some time in juli the egg ar laid on the leav
of hackberri in dens cluster each of which mai contain from two
hundr to five hundr egg these ar usual deposit in two or
more layer on upon anoth a littl more than a week later these
egg hatch each caterpillar eat through on end in a wai to cut
out the rim of a tini cap which is push up as the larva escap the
whole brood emerg at practic the same time and collect upon on
or more leav where thei begin to feed upon the succul green
tissu like so mani caterpillar that feed in compani each spin a
silken thread wherev it goe
the littl larva remain togeth until after the third moult at
which time thei ar about half grown in the more northern region
where thei ar found thei ar now like to scatter about in search of
quarter for hibern have found suitabl shelter thei remain
through the winter to come forth earli the follow spring and feed
upon the develop leav of the hackberri tree thei continu to do
thi for a few week befor thei becom full grown thei ar then
smoothbodi greenish worm about an inch and a half long stripe
longitudin in yellow and brown the hind end of the bodi is fork
in a curiou fashion and the head is even more remark for the
strang pair of tini antler project from it
these fullgrown caterpillar soon chang to pale green chrysalid
lightli stripe with longitudin line of yellow with a distinctli
point head from these chrysalid butterfli emerg earli in
summer
evid in the more southern state there ar two brood of these
butterfli each year but there is great need of more precis
knowledg in regard to them
as is the case with so mani other butterfli there is a dimorph

the meadowbrown form on of the most distinct famili group among

our eastern speci ar concern by their slender bodi and rather
larg wing tone in variou shade of brown and mark chiefli with
conspicu and characterist eyespot the larger vein of the

the common woodnymph or grayl
cercyoni alop
in the develop of our knowledg of both bird and mammal as found
upon the american contin the experi in mani case ha been
essenti thi a bird or a mammal wa first describ from some
wellknown region of north america commonli from specimen carri to
europ by earli voyag later other speci of the same genu were
brought to light by variou explor and given specif name as
each section wa thu explor a new form differ markedli from the
other wa found and name at a later period when great collect
were brought togeth so that on observ wa abl to make a care
survei of specimen from all part of the contin it wa found that
mani of these speci merg into each other through intergrad
form from region between the local of the origin speci so
it ha come about that in the case of a larg number of our bird and
mammal we have geograph race distinctli recogn instead of
separ speci
while the studi of butterfli ha by no mean receiv the degre of
attent which ha been given the bird and mammal it is alreadi
evid that a similar condit prevail with refer to mani
speci as the size of collect ha increas and more care
studi have been made of the variou form from differ region it
ha been found in numer case that thei intergrad to so great an

formerli consid entir distinct on of the most strike
exampl of thi is found in the case of our common woodnymph which
is sometim call the blueei grayl the form which is on of
our most abund butterfli in southern new england and mani of the
eastern state wa describ as satyru alop by the french
naturalist fabriciu who also describ anoth speci from the
southern state as satyru pegala and a form found in northern
canada wa describ by the english entomologist kirbi as satyru
nephel variou other form from isol region have been given
specif name by other author see plate page 81
dure recent year mani collector have gather these butterfli
from all part of north america and mani specimen have been group
togeth in the more import collect when thi occur it
becam easi to see that thi is essenti a variabl speci which
under vari climat condit ha assum slightli differ
form so that we have a good illustr of welldevelop
geograph race the more import of these ar indic in the
synopsi of the meadowbrown on page 227
the similar lifehistori
on good indic that these vari form all have a common origin
is found in the remark uniti of their lifehistori it is
essenti the same in all the mother butterfli lai egg late in
summer upon the leav of grass and perhap other plant about
three week later these egg hatch into small caterpillar that
immedi becom letharg and begin their hibern condit
without eat ani veget thei remain thu fast until spring
when after the weather warm up suffici thei begin to feed upon
grass and perhap other herbag but thei have lot of time in which
to complet their growth and thei ar veri moder in their eat
and their movement thei grow slowli so that thei do not becom
matur as caterpillar until june thei then chang to chrysalid to
emerg as butterfli dure juli and august the femal butterfli
remain upon the wing for some week befor thei begin to lai their
egg we thu have in thi case an adapt to singlebrooded in
practic all stage of the insect life the twelv month of the
year must be pass and egg larva chrysali and butterfli each
seem to try to do it part in prolong it period of life
these butterfli ar especi common along stream and near the
border of wood as well as in upland pastur and meadow thei ar
interest creatur with characterist manner of flight thei ar
by no mean so easi to captur as on might think who see them
appar go with slow errat motion from flower to flower mr
s f denton a collector of long experi ha written thi
interest paragraph upon thi point
as the flight of these insect is weak thei have been oblig to
resort to a number of trick to outwit their enemi in captur
these butterfli the collector will veri soon becom acquaint with
their mode of escap which ar veri interest and show no small
amount of cun scarc to be look for in an innoc littl
butterfli their first plan of escap on be disturb is to make
directli for a clump of bush into the thickest part of which thei
dive and there remain until the danger is past if on is startl
from the grass at some distanc from a safe retreat and the collector
overtak him he will immedi dodg backward and forward at on
time high in air and again low down near the grass top and in spite
of hi slow flight keep well clear of the net if the net is at
last brought veri close to him he will try hi last desper scheme
to elud hi pursuer and shut hi wing quickli togeth will drop
into the grass disappear as if by magic if it were not for the
cun of the frail littl creatur thei would doubtless have gone

the ei brown

for delicaci of graybrown color tone few butterfli can compar

the white mountain butterfli
oenei norna semidea
to appreci the extraordinari distribut of thi notabl speci
on must let hi fanci carri him back a million year or so until he
reach that old time when the whole northern part of the american

gradual retreat of the ic northward carri with it wonder
chang in climat and along with these climat chang take
northward mani plant and anim which were adapt to the cool
temperatur along the border of the glacier as the ic cap retreat
most of these arctic form retreat with it and all along the lower
level thei were replac by other migrat from the south so that
gradual there came about the distribut of plant and anim as
we find them todai
when howev the glacier left the higher elev of the white
mountain and the rocki mountain there were at the summit small
area in which the climat condit were of veri much the same
arctic charact as prevail along the margin of the ic cap
consequ condit were here favor for the continu of

among the anim thu left strand by the retreat ic cap thi

to appreci the fact in regard to the structur and life of thi
butterfli on must know that it habitat is confin to a thousand
feet or so at the summit of the mountain that in thi area there ar
no tree or even shrub worth mention and that the surfac of the
mountain is cover with rock between which grow a few stunt sedg
and over which grow the everpres reindeer moss it is a bleak
bare grai environ constantli swept by terrif wind where snow
is seen in august and is like to remain until june so the summer
season is of briefest durat and the climat condit ar so
sever that on can onli wonder how a fragil creatur like a

habit and lifehistori
from a first glanc at the mottl graybrown wing of these insect
on would guess that here wa a distinct exampl of oblit
color and it is true as all observ testifi that when the
butterfli light upon the stone and turn sidewai as appar it

difficult to see for the wing ar close and onli the round
mottl under surfac show it appear also to have the habit of some
of the grayl when hard push of simpli close it wing and
drop to the ground feign death in defer also to the wind
it flight is just abov the surfac doubtless if it rose high in the

the egg hatch into sluggish littl caterpillar which feed upon the
sedg leav appar eat onli at night and hide in crevic
between stone by dai as on would expect from the prevail low
temperatur these caterpillar grow veri slowli and appar a
larg proport of them requir two year to complet their
develop there seem to be some uncertainti in regard to thi
phase of the insect lifehistori but most entomologist ar of the
opinion that some of the butterfli matur in on year while other
requir two year that is the brood ar both annual and biennial
there is no doubt that the insect hibern as a caterpillar and if
thi statement about the number of brood is correct some of the
caterpillar hibern when veri small and recent hatch from the
egg while other hibern when nearli full grown
the fullgrown caterpillar chang to chrysalid beneath the shelter
of the small stone in practic the same sort of situat which
thei have chosen for hide at night or for hibern through the

befor the latter emerg mani observ have report upon thi
curiou phenomenon and have record experi demonstr that it
is a gener habit with the speci
the roost habit
the adult butterfli flock togeth at night and rest upon the
spanish moss which festoon so mani of the tree in the far south or
upon dead branch thei take posit with head upward and wing
close mani of them often flock togeth to roost and wander
out to the nearbi field when the morn sun give them renew

reliabl observ have notic that when on emerg from a chrysali
it fli up in the air and make straight for the nearest wood
other have notic that when a butterfli in a field is alarm it
also make for the wood and in the region where the speci is
abund the butterfli ar most like to be found in path and
glade in the forest thu thei show the influenc of their ancestr
habitat in the tropic wilder
there seem to be a certain amount of ceremoni attend the flock

about two week later the glass hous will burst open and the

the chang from the caterpillar to the butterfli is easier to watch in
thi speci than in most other the fullgrown caterpillar
spinssometim on the under surfac of the milkwe leaf sometim
elsewherea littl mat of silk in which it entangl the hook claw
of it hind feet then it let go with it fore feet and hang
downward with the front end of it bodi curl upward in thi
posit it remain for some hoursperhap a dayth bodi juic
gravit downward and caus a swollen appear on the lower
segment then the skin split apart and is wriggl off by the
contort of the bodi when it final drop awai there is left a
strangelook creatur broader below than abov thi is a
transit stage that last but a veri short time soon the form is
entir chang so that the broadest part is abov instead of below
the definit outlin of the chrysali is soon taken on the outer
tissu harden into a distinct cover the insect is now a
beauti green with wonder golden spot upon it surfac and a few
black spot just below the black cremast by which the chrysali is
connect with the web of silk upon the leaf
in thi quiet chrysali the insect remain for nearli a fortnight
then the structur of the forthcom butterfli begin to show through
the thin outer cover and you know that the period of the chrysali
is nearli end if you keep watch you will probabl see the sudden
burst of the outer envelop and the quick grasp of it surfac
by the leg of the newli emerg butterfli it wing at first ar
short and crumpl bear littl resembl to those of the fulli
develop butterfli but as it hang there with on pair of leg
hold to the empti chrysali and the other to the leaf abov the
wing rapidli lengthen hang limpli downward and the bodi juic
penetr the vein a littl later thei expand in the other
direct the hind wing reach full size befor the front on do
final both pair of wing ar fulli expand and the butterfli is
like to walk to the top of the support where it rest for an hour
or two while it tissu harden befor it attempt to fly
in earli autumn out of door these butterfli start southward on
their long journei thei often gather in great flock and roost at
night on waysid shrub and tree at thi season it is easi to catch
them in an insect net and bring them indoor for pet thei live for a
long while and lend interest and beauti to live room or window
garden to the photograph thei offer opportun for attract

the gener form and color pattern of thi fine butterfli show at
onc that it is relat to the monarch it gener color ar
chocolatebrown and black dot and spot with white the egg ar
laid upon milkwe and the lifehistori is much like that of the
monarch on of the most interest fact in connect with thi
speci is that it seem to be mimick by the vicerein butterfli in
the same wai that the monarch is mimick by the viceroi
the snout butterfli or longbeak
famili libytheida
on ha a suggest of hobson choic in the common name of thi
uniqu famili if snout butterfli doe not seem suffici eleg
as a descript phrase for such delic creatur he can call them
the longbeak until he see that thi also is inadequ as a
matter of fact both ar misnom for the project from the head
that give them these name is neither a snout nor a beak it is
simpli a pair of palpi unusu develop which perhap in an earli
stage of butterfli histori serv a us purpos at present
howev thei serv chiefli to set the few owner apart from the other
butterfli in the system of classif although possibl thei
mai also serv the butterfli by help to give the impress of a
leaf attach to a twig see plate page 240
the snout butterfli
hypatu bachmani
there is a peculiar interest in ani form of anim life which can be
definit trace far back through the geolog ag in nearli everi
group of live creatur there ar certain type which scientist
have found were onc abund but which now ar on the wane as a rule
these ar better repres in the museum through fossil speci
than by those now live to a consider extent also such form ar
like to present variou featur which mark their primit
condit and the live alli have peculiar which set them off
as distinct from those of their own relat which have been model
in a more modern fashion among the mammal the curiou marsupi of
which our southern opossum is an exampl furnish good illustr
of thi gener truth among the bird the curiou littl least
bittern is an exampl among the butterfli the strang snout
butterfli is by far the best exampl
these snout butterfli of which onli two speci ar now live in
north america ar the sole repres with us of the famili
libytheida or the longbeak onli on of these speci occur to
ani extent at least north of texa it is the curiou littl creatur
call the snout butterfli it ha a strang appear due to the
angular outlin of both front and hind wing and the long palpi which
project forward from the head in a wai to attract attent the
common name is due to these project palpi even the color is
primit the gener tone of the wing be blackish brown
distinctli mark with white and orang spot the under surfac is
less primit in it color be tone in iridesc grayish
brown in a wai to suggest protect color except in that part of
each front wing which is not hidden when the insect is at rest thi
show the white and orangebrown mark
some year ago there were found in certain fossil deposit in the
west about a dozen speci of fossil butterfli it is strang inde
that these ether creatur should be fossil at all on would
think it scarc possibl that thei could be so preserv that a
million year after thei had di man should be abl to studi them
determin to what famili thei belong and even guess with a high
probabl of accuraci upon what leav their caterpillar fed thi
littl collect of fossil butterfli wa studi by on of the
great american author on live butterfli the late samuel h
scudder who said of them thei ar gener preserv in such fair
condit that the cours of the nervur and the color pattern of
the wing can be determin and even in on case the scale mai be
studi as a rule thei ar so well preserv that we mai feel nearli
as confid concern their affin with those now live as if
we had pin specimen to examin and gener speak the older
thei ar the better thei ar preserv
a curiou fact is that out of the compar few speci of these
fossil butterfli two were easili recogn as member of thi
longbeak famili thei were given special scientif name and
undoubtedli were close relat to the snout butterfli which is still
fly everi year in variou part of the unit state our modern
speci lai it egg upon the leav of hackberri and in these
geolog deposit of that fargon era there have been found
wellpreserv leav of old hackberri tree upon which it is
extrem probabl that the caterpillar of these ancient longbeak
fed what an opportun for a modern collector of butterfli to work
hi fanci as he think of those old time when these fossil creatur
were fly in the sunshin deposit their egg upon the leav of
tree that made up landscap pictur probabl veri differ from
those of todai and how he wonder what flower these butterfli
visit for their nectar food what bird chase them from tree to
tree and what mammal wander through those ancient forest what a
suggest also it give of the continu of life upon our old earth
to realiz that these butterfli of todai ar carri on their
brief exist in practic the same wai that these forbear of
their did so mani million of year ago
anoth wai in which these butterfli ar peculiar is the fact that
the femal have six welldevelop leg while the male have onli
four as alreadi indic the caterpillar feed upon hackberri when
full grown thei ar about an inch long dark green stripe with
yellow with two blackish tubercul on the second ring behind the
head thei appar pass the winter in the chrysali stage the
butterfli ar like to be found along the border of brook or
stream run through wood or along the margin of the forest
occasion thei becom abund in certain local but on the
whole thei ar rare and highli prize by collector
the metalmark
famili riodinida
thi small famili of veri small butterfli contain five genera and a
dozen speci found in the unit state and mexico onli two
howev occur in the eastern region and onli on extend much north
of the gulf state asid from certain peculiar of the
wingven a costal and a humer vein on the hind wing these
metalmark mai be known by their minut and the bright metal
mark on the brown wing
both our eastern speci belong to the genu caleph the small
metalmark c caeniu ha been collect in florida and georgia
the wing ar rusti red on both surfac brighter below than abov
and mark with blackish spot that almost converg to form stripe
in addit to which there ar beyond the middl of each wing two
line made by special scale that glisten with a steel glitter the
wing expand onli about three quarter of an inch so far as i can
learn the egg larva or pupa have never been describ
the larg metalmark is call by scienc caleph boreali but
it deserv the latter name onli in the sens that it is more northern
than it alli it ha been collect as far north as new york and
michigan but it seem to be veri seldom found at least in eastern
region it expand a littl more than an inch the gener color of
the wing is yellowish brown mark with blackish dot and line

the gossamerw
famili lycaenida
the daintiest and most delic of all our butterfli ar includ
among the gossamerw their bodi ar small and slender their
antenna ring with white and almost threadlik their wing thin and
of exquisit beauti mani of them ar mark with the slenderest of
tail project from the hind wing when the face is view
from in front it is seen to be much narrow than it height at the
insert of the antenna the ey ar notch and thei ar also more
or less surround with white scale most of the caterpillar have
oval slugshap smooth bodi with the under surfac flatten
and veri small head which in mani speci can be extend by mean
of an extensil neck the chrysalid ar held in place by silken
thread both at the tail and over the middl thei ar round short
and stout
notwithstand their small size the gossamerw ar among the
most sprite of all our butterfli thei seem inde wing sprite
plai everywher in field and open wood along road lane and
brook in dooryard and gardenswherev in fact a bit of open
space invit their presenc not alon upon the wing but even when at
rest doe their liveli appear for most of these butterfli have
the curiou habit of keep the hind wing in motion after alight
rub them against each other in a vertic plane or move them
backward and forward when half expand these habit ar so fix
that when on see a butterfli thu engag on can pretti certainli
conclud it is a member of thi famili
the gossamerw ar commonli separ into three rather distinct
tribesth hairstreak the copper and the blue the
characterist featur ar these
three branch aris from the radiu of each front wing under
surfac of hind wing commonli mark with threadlik streak the
hairstreak
four branch aris from the radiu of each front wing under
surfac of hind wing commonli mark with spot rather than line
color brownish red the copper
color blue the blue
the tribe of the hairstreak
the hairstreak ar small butterfli with the ey notch to allow
for the insert of the base of the antenna the name is given on
account of the fine hairlik mark which extend across the under
surfac of the hind wing in mani speci there is a tail
project or two on the hind inner margin of the hind wing the
caterpillar ar remark for the small head so connect with the
bodi that it can be push forward in a characterist wai
the hairstreak ar among the most exquisit and delic of all our
butterfli a larg proport of them have the upper surfac of the
wing tone in beauti hue of grayish brown and the under surfac
lighter grai mark with dot and stripe some of which ar
brilliant in color a few of the larger speci ar brilliantli
iridesc in purpl blue and green mark with black the male
have welldevelop scentpocket in mani speci these be
commonli along the front border of the front wing
a veri interest suggest in regard to the possibl function of
the curiou tail project wa made nearli a hundr year ago by
some english entomologist and ha sinc been discuss at
consider length in variou public it is that the slender
tail togeth with the enlarg of the wing just back of them
give the impress of a fals head along with thi unusu
develop of the wing is to be consid the fact that these
butterfli nearli alwai alight head downward so that the fals head
furnish with what seem to be wave antenna take the place that
would natur be occupi by the true head instanc have been
report in which thi fals head ha appar been nip off by a
lizard and much evid ha accumul to indic that thi curiou
devic mai be a real protect in mani case of cours the loss of
the tail and the part of the wing adjac would be compar
insignific in most case these project on the wing ar held
at right angl to the plane of the wing
while nearli half a hundr speci of hairstreak have been found in
north america onli a few of these ar suffici abund to
requir discuss in thi littl book
the great purpl hairstreak
atlid halesu
it seem someth of a reflect on the activ of american
entomologist to sai that after the laps of more than a centuri
sinc abbott studi the insect of georgia our knowledg of the
earli stage of two of the largest hairstreak butterfli is still
confin to the observ he made yet thi is true and on of
themth great purpl hairstreaki the largest speci of the
group that occur in the eastern unit state the other is the
whitem hairstreak
the great purpl hairstreak is a beauti iridesc blue creatur
as seen from abov with blackish border around the blue as seen
from below the wing ar dark brown with red spot near the bodi
the two taillik project ar quit long it is veri larg for the
group to which it belong measur nearli two inch across the
expand wing it is a tropic form extend into our southern
border from california to florida and occasion occur north as
far as southern illinoi the larva feed on oak see plate page
256
the whitem hairstreak
eupsych malbum
the whitem hairstreak is about two third the size of the great
purpl speci with less blue and more black on the upper wing
surfac the hind tail is slender and well develop and the angl of
the wing just back of it is round out in an unusu fashion the
lower surfac of the wing is of a gener grayish brown color mark
by a white stripe which take the form of the letter m henc it
name thi is also a southern speci occur at time as far north
as ohio and even atlant citi new jersei the caterpillar feed upon
the leav of oak and astragalu or milk vetch
there is also a third speci of thi group of whose histori we ar
ignor except for abbot observ it is an exquisit littl
butterfli call the least purpl hairstreak calycopi cecrop
and is appar a tropic form which ha spread into our southern
state it is especi beauti becaus of the brilliant red and
white line run across the under surfac of both wing it occur
as far north as west virginia and kentucki and rang westward at
least to the mississippi vallei
the grai hairstreak
uranot melinu
thi exquisit littl creatur is capabl of surviv under a great
varieti of climat condit it rang from new hampshir to
florida and central america but appar occur onli rare north
of the unit state perhap the most distinct featur in the
femal is the orang spot just in front of a pair of tini tail on
each hind wing the rear on be curious curv and about three
time as long as the other in the male the shorter tail is absent
the gener color of the upper surfac is a dark bluish grai reliev
on the margin of each hind wing by a few white dot and the orang
spot alreadi mention the under surfac is much lighter grai
distinctli mark with two dark brown line near the margin the outer
line littl more than a row of spot and the inner line with a white
edg see plate page 257
these small butterfli lai tini though beauti egg upon a varieti
of plant the egg hatch into curiou littl caterpillar that have
the appear of slug with small head which can be extend as if
the littl creatur had realli a rubber neck the object of thi
extensil head is seen when on find the larva feed upon the
fruit or the seedpod of it variou food plantshawthorn hop
houndstongu and st johnswort the caterpillar is abl to thrust
it jaw into the interior of the seedpod and devour their
content there seem to be gener two brood in a season even in
the more northern part of it rang while toward the south there ar
probabl at least three brood the butterfli ar found upon the
wing almost ani time in summer especi from earli june until late
in august
the band hairstreak
thecla calanu
thi is on of the most familiar of the delic littl butterfli
group in the genu thecla it occur rather commonli in a great
stretch of territori extend from main west to nebraska south to
new mexico and texa and east to alabama and georgia it also occur
in a limit area on the coast of california the gener color of the
upper surfac is a dark brown which in the male is mark near the
front edg of the fore wing with a distinct grai patch of scent
scale the under side is similar in color to the upper except that
the outer half of the wing is mark by two seri of broken line in
white blue and brown and a brilliant bit of color just in front
of the tail project of the hind wing thi color show
beauti tone of red blue and black
these littl butterfli mai often be seen visit the midsumm
flower but ar fulli as like to be found along the side of a shadi
road where thei rest upon the leav of tree shrub and herbac
plant when disturb thei fly up in small compani but soon settl
back again into their previou posit thei ar lover of sunshin
and mai often be seen upon a leaf with fulli expand wing take
a sunbath there is but on brood a year butterfli appear earli
in summer and remain for sever week thei lai their tini pale
green egg upon the leav of variou tree especi oak and
hickori and probabl hawthorn it is not known whether these egg
remain unhatch as a rule until the follow spring or whether thei
soon hatch and the young caterpillar hibern without feed it is
probabl that both condit occur in spring the larva eat hole in
the leav of their food plant and grow rather slowli gradual
becom brown or green sluglik caterpillar about half an inch
long thei final chang into greenish brown chrysalid from which
the butterfli emerg in earli summer
the stripe hairstreak
thecla liparop
in the eastern state the distribut of thi speci is almost the
same as that of the band hairstreak but in the central west the
outlin of it region move northward extend into canada abov
north dakota and into montana and wyom it doe not go so far
south howev extend practic onli to the southern border of
kansa and missouri the butterfli bear a strike gener
resembl to the other speci just name differ chiefli in the
fact that the under surfac of the wing is much more thickli mark
with broken line that extend nearer to the bodi as a rule it is not
common and consequ it is prize by collector some good
observ have notic that it is more like to be found onli on
flower instead of sun itself on leav it is singlebrood
hibern either in the egg state or in that of the young larva
the food plant ar vari there be good evid that the
caterpillar feed upon all of these appl plum shadbush blueberri
holli chestnut willow thorn and sever kind of oak mr w f
fisk found a chrysali of thi speci in the desert nest of a tent
caterpillar in new hampshir in earli june the butterfli emerg
later in the month
the acadian hairstreak
thecla acadica
thi is on of the numer butterfli that offer some young student
an opportun to make real contribut to scienc it is a
beauti littl creatur expand scarc an inch across it
outstretch wing found from new england west to montana along a
rather restrict area which coincid pretti close with the
southern part of the transit zone there is a form on the pacif
coast which is commonli consid to be thi same speci
these butterfli appear dure juli and august thei visit variou
flower but ar especi like to be found near willow thicket
along the border of brook and swamp it is suppos that the egg
ar laid upon the willow and that thei remain unhatch until the
follow spring then thei develop into littl caterpillar that feed
upon the willow leav and matur in time to form chrysalid earli in
june these chrysalid in turn disclos the butterfli earli in juli
so far as i know the egg themselv and the situat in which thei
ar laid have never been describ
the oliv hairstreak
mitoura damon
veri few butterfli have the distinct of show a clear case of
protect resembl to on kind of plant in both the adult and the
larval stage thi is the case howev with thi oliv hairstreak
which is so intim associ with our common red cedar that
where on is found the other is like to occur although both
caterpillar and butterfli ar seldom seen becaus thei resembl the
twig of the cedar so close
along the atlant coast thi littl butterfli occur from new
hampshir to florida and westward to a line drawn from dakota to
texa the upper surfac of the wing is rather dark olivebrown and
the under surfac so far as it is expos when the butterfli is
rest is of a greenish hue that harmon with the green of the
red cedar twig there ar also on the under surfac some irregular
line and dot of red brown and white which probabl help in
render the insect inconspicu when it is rest among a cluster
of twig
the yearli histori of thi beauti littl butterfli differ from
that of most of it rel the speci winter in the chrysali
state the first brood of butterfli burst forth earli in mai
these lai their egg upon or between the scale of the red cedar
twig especi those which bear flower about a week later the
egg hatch into tini caterpillar that feed upon the scalelik
leav continu to eat and grow for nearli six week befor thei
reach their full size these caterpillar ar so similar in color that
thei ar difficult to see and thei have a remark protect
devic in that the first ring behind the head is develop into a
shield which cover the head hide it so complet that the
movement of the jaw in feed is effect conceal late in june
thei chang to chrysalid part of which appear to remain in thi
condit until the follow spring while most of them give forth a
second brood of butterfli in juli these butterfli lai egg for a
second brood of larva that matur into chrysalid dure septemb
and hibern in thi condit until the follow spring
consequ in the northern state the collector should look for
fresh specimen in mai and earli june and again in juli and earli
august
these butterfli visit variou flower appar prefer rather
small blossom such as those of the mouseear everlast which is
in bloom when the first brood is fly and the variou member of
the mint famili especi spearmint as well as the sumac which
ar in bloom when the second brood is on the wing the time between
flower visit seem to be spent at rest upon the red cedar branch
and on of the surest wai to find the butterfli is to give these
tree a sudden jar which start them into flight in fact thei mai
often be seen fly around the top of the cedar a score of feet
from the ground

the wander
feniseca tarquiniu
in mani order of insect there ar whole famili whose larva ar
habitu carnivor feed entir upon other kind of insect
thi is especi so in case of the beetl the fli the true
bug and the great order to which the bee and wasp belong among
the scalewing insect howev carnivor caterpillar ar rare
seldom occur among the moth and in hardli more than on speci
among the butterfli thi on except is the modestlook littl
butterfli fancifulli call the wander perhap becaus instead of
frequent the floweri field where other butterfli congreg it
wander in and out among the alder by brook and pond alight
often upon a leaf or twig than upon a flowerth latter appar
lack for it the attract it ha for other butterfli
if you watch on of these copperhu creatur for awhil howev
you will soon see that it wander is not aimless but ha rather a
method all it own perhap you will see it alight upon an alder twig
on or abov which you ar like to notic curiou woolli white
excresc if you ar close enough you will probabl see the
butterfli uncoil it tongu and sip up a liquid on twig or leafth
exud of the woolli aphid that make up the suppos excresc
and suck the sap from the bark much of thi sap pass through the
bodi of the aphid and collect in liquid globul on twig and
leav form a sort of honeydew which is much sought after by
fli wasp and other insect it seem to form the chief susten
of these wander
but mani of these butterfli have anoth purpos besid that of
sip the honeydew should you watch on of the mother butterfli
carefulli you would be like to see her alight on or near a coloni of
woolli aphid and run rather rapidli over them in a wasplik manner
final stop long enough to lai a tini roundish slightli
flatten egg upon the twig gener on the under side and onli on
in a place then she mai continu her wai wander lazili along the
alderbord stream
let us now centr our interest upon the egg three or four dai later
it hatch into a curiou caterpillar instead of have mouth part
fit for bite leav as is the case with most butterfli larva it
ha on fit for grasp pierc and suck the juic of the
plump bodi of the aphid which it find hard by it place of birth
it also ha silk spinneret connect with it mouth so it is abl to
spin a web to shelter it from be run over by it intend victim
the newli hatch larva is not slow to take advantag of the
facil with which it is provid it at onc begin to spin a web
abov and around itself from the end of which it reach out for the
nearest aphid suck their lifeblood and cast their empti skin
to the discard of it protect web the skin thu serv as an
addit shelter so that as the caterpillar move forward
increas the number of it victim from dai to dai it extend it
web and the protect of the cast skin intermingl with it while
through allth cast skin the silken web and even the hair on the
bodi of the caterpillarther run a woof of the woolli
excretioneffectu conceal the larva from sight
the woolli aphid thu serv as the sole food of the caterpillar
dure it brief life as a larva perhap becaus of the predigest
natur of it food it is abl to matur much sooner than most
butterfli larva in about eleven dai after hatch it is readi to
chang to a chrysali have undergon dure thi period onli three
moult instead of at least four as with other caterpillar each
caterpillar then chang to a chrysali which is remark becaus
the form and color of it back bear a strike resembl to the
face of a miniatur monkei it remain in thi condit nearli a
fortnight and then emerg as a butterfli
in new england and the northern state the short life of the larva
enabl thi insect to matur three brood each season farther south
there ar probabl more for thi speci is wide distribut in

thi littl butterfli is on of the most gener abund insect in
the northern part of north america it commonli occur from ocean to

open space of field and forest when seen through a len it is veri
beautifulli color the copperi red of the wing be overspread
with conspicu black dot and a touch of orang around the outer

on of the smallest of our common butterfli
the caterpillar of the american copper feed upon sorrel on of the
commonest weedi plant of wast place everywher the rusti red
blossom of the sorrel harmon in color with the color of the
butterfli which is frequent to be seen fly slowli abov the
plant stop now and then to lai it egg singli upon the leav
or stem each egg soon hatch into a curiou caterpillar which
look more like a slug than the usual type of butterfli larva it
feed upon the succul tissu of the sorrel leaf at first bite

about three week chang into a chrysali under the shelter of a
stone or board a littl later it again chang to a butterfli
there is an interest variat in the number of brood of thi
butterfli each season in region where it ha been studi it ha
been found to be doublebrood in northern new england and
triplebrood in southern new england and the atlant state it is
probabl that in it far northern home in the hudson bai territori it
is onli singlebrood it is thought that the insect hibern as a
chrysali
these littl butterfli ar so small and fly so near the ground that
thei ar like to be overlook by the casual observ thei
frequent alight to sun themselv or to sip nectar from mani kind
of flower thei begin their dai work earli in the morn and

the tribe of the blue
these beauti littl butterfli ar well name for the major of
them ar color in exquisit tint of blue thei ar distinguish
from the copper by thi blue color as well as by the fact that
the spine on the under side of the tarsi ar arrang in row rather
than in cluster and ar compar few in number the bodi is
rather slender and the under surfac of the wing ar gener
dot in a characterist fashion most of the two score or more
speci found in north america occur on the pacif coast or in the

for a wee bit of a gossamerwing creatur that expand scarc an
inch across it outstretch wing the spring azur ha caus
american scientist an immens amount of patient labor over the vast
territori from labrador across to alaska and south to the gulf of
mexico thi littl blue butterfli exist in so mani differ form
that it requir special analyt kei to separ them not onli
doe it vari geograph so that in on local we find on form
and in anoth a differ form but it also vari season to a
mark degre as on would expect there is a strike differ in
it annual cycl between labrador and the gulf coast in the far
northern region there is but on brood a year while in the southern
region there ar at least two and perhap more
the variat in thi butterfli ar shown by the differ in the
mark of both surfac of the wing these mark mai run from a
faint blackish border along the extrem margin and a few faint dot
upon the under surfac to a wide black margin around the wing and a
deep abund spot of the under surfac the mark of the
variou form ar so uniform that the varieti ar easili
distinguish it is beyond the scope of thi book to attempt to
differenti all these varieti but ani reader interest will find
an admir summari of the condit illustr by an excel
plate in comstock how to know the butterfli the speci as a
whole mai be known from the fact that the upper surfac is blue the
lower surfac ashgrai more or less spot with dark brown and the
wing ar without tail see plate page 256
the strang structur of the larva
a remark variat of the adult is suffici to give thi
speci a special interest but the larva also have a uniqu
attract for the naturalist the mother butterfli lai their egg
upon the flower bud of variou plant especi those which have
cluster racem of blossom these egg hatch into minut sluglik
larva which feed upon the bud commonli burrow through the calyx
lobe and devour the undevelop stamen and pistil insid thei
final chang to chrysalid which ar more or less secur attach
to a central flower stalk from which in due time the butterfli
emerg so far there is noth remark about thi stori of the
life of the spring azur but that is yet to come
these littl caterpillar ar subject to attack by tini parasit
fli which lai egg in their bodi each egg hatch into a still
more tini maggot that live at the expens of the tissu of the
caterpillar and final kill it when on of these littl
caterpillar ha it head buri in the round ball of a flower bud
about half of it bodi is expos defenseless so that the littl fly
that light upon it to lai her egg cannot even be dislodg by the
head of the caterpillar as is often the case with other speci
there is a veri curiou provis for defens howev if you look
carefulli through a len at the hind part of the bodi you will find a
littl open on the back of the seventh abdomin ring thi open
lead to a sort of tini pocket a pocket which the caterpillar can
turn insid out when it so desir now the curiou thing about it is
that the caterpillar while thi pocket is conceal in it bodi is
abl to secret in it a drop of liquid which we presum to be sweet to
the tast when the littl pocket is partli fill with thi drop of
liquid the caterpillar turn it insid out in such a wai that the
liquid drop remain in posit on top of the protrud pocket
perhap you ask what is the good of all thi complic arrang
if you could see what happen when the littl drop of whatfor lack
of a better namew shall call honeydew is expos you would begin
to guess the reason wherev these larva ar found you will also
find mani ant wander round among them and the moment the
honeydew appear these ant begin to sip it up when it is all gone
the littl caterpillar draw in it pocket again and presum begin
to store up anoth bit of liquid it is certainli a curiou exampl
of what the naturalist call symbiosi which simpli mean a live
togeth of two anim each help the other in some wai in thi
case it is easi enough to see how the caterpillar help the ant but
perhap you ar wonder in what possibl wai the ant mai help the
caterpillar i hardli dare give the most plausibl explan for
fear some on will cry out naturefak but fortun the
explan is base upon at least on precis observ by w h
edward on of the most care and reliabl naturalist america ha
produc who live befor the recent era of naturefak and wa
never accus of sensation mr edward saw an ant drive awai
from on of these caterpillar a littl parasit fly which appar
wa search for a victim consequ it would appear that the
ant help the caterpillar by protect them from these arch
enemi
thi is by no mean an isol exampl of the relat between ant
and other insect it ha been known for hundr of year that the
ant us the aphid as a sort of domest milkproduc attend the
aphid at all time and even care for their egg throughout the
winter season as the plantlic live in coloni suck the sap of
their host plant thei ar attend by great number of ant that
feed upon the honeydew which pass through their bodi in mani
case the ant have been observ to stroke the aphid with their
antenna in a wai which seem to induc the aphid to give out a drop
of the sweet liquid for the ant to lap up in a similar wai these ant
seem sometim to stroke these littl caterpillar with their antenna
and thu to induc them to turn their littl pocket insid out with
the drop of liquid at the tip thi is certainli an unusu and most
interest relat between two insect far separ by their
structur charact
the littl pocket that i have thu describ is situat upon the
seventh segment of the abdomen just back of it there ar two other
open which ar even more curiou in their structur these ar
provid with some slender tentacl on which there ar circl of
hairi spur these structur ar a great puzzl to naturalist it is
difficult to explain what thei ar for unless we assum that thei
relat in some wai to the honeydew pocket on the seventh ring the
onli plausibl explan is that these serv to advertis to the
ant by give off a distinct odor that there is nectar near at
hand to be had for the ask thei would thu be analog in a wai
to the fragrant scent of flower which is for the purpos of
advertis to the bee the fact that nectar or pollen or both ar near
at hand and mai be had for the ask in the case of these
caterpillar howev if thi is the true explan it is a most
wonder provis and on which would be like to tax the ingenu
of man mind for a long while befor it wa origin
so thi littl butterfli which greet us in everi spring like a
violet afloat to quot mr scudder happi phrase is full of
interest at all stage of it exist it should lead on to a new
respect for the familiar thing in the natur world when on learn
how baffl to the wit of the wisest scientist is thi littl
creatur with it protean form and the wonder structur of it
caterpillar
scudder blue
rusticu scudderi
thi beauti littl butterfli is perhap the most richli color of
all our northern blue the upper surfac of the wing in the male is
a nearli uniform hue except for a narrow dark border around the
margin in the femal there is in addit a seri of blackcentr
orang spot insid of the black border the seri be more
promin on the hind wing than on the front on the under surfac
is veri pale with distinct mark in black scatter over the basal two
third with a row of orang spot outsid of these and anoth row of
small blackish spot just insid of the blackish border stripe
thi butterfli is a northern speci it occur in new england new
york and michigan and thenc extend far north into canada the
caterpillar feed upon blue lupin and appar the butterfli is
like to be found in most place where thi plant grow the egg ar
laid upon the leav or stem and the littl caterpillar come out of
the shell through small hole which thei have gnaw
the caterpillar wrote mr scudder ha a veri extens head and
flexibl neck and it manner of feed immedi after birth is
rather remark it pierc the lower cuticl of the leaf make a
hole just larg enough to introduc it minut head and then devour
all the interior of the leaf as far as it can reachmani time the
diamet of the holeso that when the caterpillar goe elsewher the
leaf look as if mark with a circular blister have a central
nucleu the nearli colorless membran of the leaf be all that is
left and at the central entranc to the blister the upper membran
onli later in it life it often modifi thi feed habit
somewhat and as it approach full growth it is like to devour the
entir blade of the leaf
these larva have the curiou nectarsecret gland on the seventh
abdomin segment which ar discuss in connect with the preced

happen that the easiest wai to find the caterpillar is to look for
these attend in new england there ar two brood of the

the giant skipper megathymida
the common skipper hesperiida
these insect as a whole ar distinguish from the higher butterfli
by their larg mothlik bodi small wing hook antenna except
in the giant skipper by have five branch of the radiu vein
aris from the larg central cell the larva spin slight cocoon in
which to pupat and the pupa ar round rather than angular
the two famili ar readili distinguish by the differ in their

emerg as adult
the common skipper
famili hesperiida
the skipper ar the least develop of the butterfli thei show
their close relationship to the moth both by their structur and
their habit the larva make slight cocoon befor chang to
chrysalid and these chrysalid ar so round that thei suggest the
pupa of moth rather than those of butterfli the common
nameskippersi due to the habit of the butterfliesa jerki
skip flight as thei wing their errat wai from flower to flower
in north america the skipper famili includ nearli two hundr
speci group in about forti genera from thi point of view it is
the largest famili of our butterfli but on account of the small
size and limit rang of most of the speci it ha by no mean the
gener import of such famili as the nymph the swallowtail
or the pierid
the skipper ar remark for the uniform of structur in each
stage of exist the butterfli have small wing and larg bodi
the broad head bear larg ey without hair but with a tuft of
curv bristl overhang each the antenna ar hook at the end
and wide separ at the base each short palpu ha a larg middl
joint and a small joint at the tip the fore wing project out at the
front angl and the hind wing ar fold along the inner margin
there ar six welldevelop leg in both sex the color ar
chiefli variou tone of brown dull rather than bright and mani of
the form resembl on anoth so close that it is difficult to

the skipper caterpillar have stout bodi and ar easili known by the
constrict neck most of these have the habit of make nest from
the leav of the food plant weav them togeth with silken
thread in a similar wai each also make a slight cocoon when it is
readi to chang to a chrysali
the skipper found in eastern north america ar commonli group into
two typesth larger skipper and the smaller skipper the
characterist ar given in the paragraph immedi follow and
the on on page 278
the tribe of the larger skipper
the butterfli of thi tribe have that part of the club of the
antenna which is recurv about as long as the thicker part below
it as a rule the abdomen is distinctli shorter than the hind wing
the caterpillar ar rather short and thick and the upper part of the
head when look at from in front is squar or roundish rather than
taper the chrysalid have the tongu case attach throughout it
length and stop short of the tip of the wing case
the silverspot skipper

on can seldom draw hard and fast artifici line in natur there
ar all sort of intermedi condit which disturb arbitrari
classif it might seem simpl enough to sai that some insect
ar leafrol and other ar tentmak but as a matter of fact
in the case of the silverspot skipper we have an insect which
start it larval life as a leafrol and finish it as a
tentmak it lifehistori is rather interest and easili
observ if on can find the larva at work upon the leav of
locust and other tree see plate page 272273
the silverspot skipper is on of the largest butterfli of the

surfac of the leaflet of locust and other plant of the legum
famili in less than a week each egg hatch into a littl caterpillar
with a veri larg head and a compar larg bodi taper

from the leafi case and the tree that bear it and find such shelter
as thei can upon the ground near by here thei spin slight silken
cocoon within which thei chang to chrysalid in the more northern

particularli us to those which need to make a winter nest
by a littl search almost ani time after the middl of june on is

thi fasten is not continu but is more or less intermitt so
that the turnedov margin is like to have an irregular border
where it join the blade insid of thi tubular construct a rather
unusu look wormlik caterpillar is probabl to be seen late in

less mark with darker and lighter spot toward the northern limit
of it rang there is but on brood a year but farther south there ar
two although it is not improb that some of the caterpillar of
the first brood remain unchang throughout the season so that the
insect is both singl and doublebrood in the same local

on brood the butterfli appear in open wood and on cutov land
in mai and june thei lai egg upon the twig of oak tree on egg in

littl caterpillar that crawl upon a nearbi leaf and begin the
construct of it tubular nest by bend over the margin and sew
it with golden silk it util thi nest chiefli as a tent for
rest and sleep and wander awai from it gener to anoth
leaf when it is readi to feed it grow veri slowli have befor it
all the week of summer to complet it caterpillar growth as it get
larger it need a new tent and is like to desert it earli on when
it doe thi some observ have note a curiou habit it cut loos
all the silk that bind the margin of the leaf down upon the blade so
that the flap is free to spring back to it origin posit it
would be difficult to suggest an adequ explan for thi habit
when autumn come our caterpillar is face with the problem of pass
through the winter successfulli it must shelter itself from bird
spider predac beetl and mani other enemi it must find a
mean of keep out of the reach of snow and rain for while it can
surviv a great degre of cold as long as it keep dry it might
easili be kill by freez up with moistur but the caterpillar is
abl to provid against these danger it ha appar an abund
suppli of liquid silk to secret from the silk gland in it head so
it line it tubular tent with a dens silken web that effectu
exclud enemi and moistur it thu ha on the outsid of it nest
the thick oak leaf and on the insid a dens soft line that make a
most admir winter protect so it remain here throughout the
winter the leaf commonli stai on the tree until earli spring then
leaf nest and enclos caterpillar ar like to drop to the ground
to remain until spring arriv in earnest just what happen then
seem to be a bit doubt the caterpillar chang to a chrysali
but whether it first work it wai out of it winter nest and make a
new and less dens cover seem not to be certainli known here is

a veri pale transvers band which is almost obsolet the butterfli is
found from ocean to ocean along the northern tier of state it also
occur in the eastern state as far south as florida as well as in the
state along the pacif coast
the food plant of the caterpillar differ from most of those of the
other skipper the butterfli lai their yellowish green egg on in
a place upon the leav of willow and poplar these soon hatch into
littl caterpillar each of which cut out a small flap along the
margin of the leaf and fold it over fasten it in place with
silken thread it thu form a protect nest within which it
remain dure the dai go forth at night to a neighbor part of
the same leaf or to anoth leaf and feed upon the green surfac
tissu in thi first caterpillar stage it doe not eat the vein to
ani extent as it becom larger it construct a larger nest and feed
more freeli upon the leaf tissu when about half grown it ha the
curiou habit of bite out small hole here and there in the blade so
that the leaf take on a veri unusu appear the presenc of
these hole is gener the easiest wai to find the caterpillar for

after a few week the caterpillar becom full grown thei then sew
themselv in for the winter fasten all of the crevic in the

winter is like to take place about midsumm the caterpillar
remain quiet from thi time until the follow spring the nest
of cours fall in autumn with the leav and the caterpillar remain

occur over practic the whole of the unit state except in
the state along the canadian border from wisconsin westand in
sever of these it is found along their southern limit
thi butterfli is of particular interest becaus it is on of the

except in florida it lifehistori wa carefulli work out by dr
jame fletcher late entomologist to the dominion of canada and in
the north mai be summar thu the butterfli come from the
hibern chrysalid in mai or june thei remain upon the wing for
sever week so that worn specimen mai be taken late in juli or
rare even earli in august the femal lai egg upon grass blade
these egg hatch about two week later the larva eat their wai
out of the shell so slowli that a whole dai mai be taken up by the
oper each littl caterpillar weav a silken nest for itself in
which it remain conceal most of the time reach out to feed upon
adjac blade of grass but retir into the nest at the least
alarm it is a sluggish littl creatur and grow so slowli that in
the north it mai requir more than two month to becom full fed as a
larva it is then about an inch long and ha the characterist
outlin of the other skipper larva with a black head and a greenish
brown bodi it now spin a cocoon possibl us it larval nest as
a basi and some time later befor cold weather sure it chang
to a chrysali that winter over
thi is the stori of the life of the butterfli in the more northern
part of it rang even in new hampshir there seem to be at least a
partial second brood and farther south there ar probabl two regular
brood with the possibl that a small percentag of the first set
of chrysalid remain unchang until spring
the roadsid skipper
amblyscirt viali
thi littl butterfli is found appar in most part of the unit
state as it ha been collect in new england california texa
and mani intermedi point over the northern part of it rang
there is but on brood a year in new hampshir the butterfli appear
in mai and earli june and lai egg upon the blade of variou grass
these hatch about ten dai later into slender silkspin
caterpillar each of which make a nest for itself by sew togeth
the margin of on or more grass blade when the larva get larger
thei make larger and denser nest with heavi line of silken web
after the earlier moult the thin skin is cover with veri fine
snowwhit hair between which there is develop a curiou whitish
exud so that the caterpillar have a floccul appear when
full grown thei chang to delic green chrysalid which appar
in the north remain until the follow spring befor disclos the
butterfli in more southern region there ar two brood each
summer
the least skipper
ancyloxipha numitor
the least skipper differ from the other skipper both in structur
and habit most of these butterfli have thick bodi and a distinct
hook at the end of each antenna thi ha a slender bodi and the
antenna lack the hook most skipper have strong wing and show their
strength in their rapid errat flight thi ha feebl wing that
show their weak in their slow straight flight but from the fact
that it is about the smallest of all our butterfli expand littl
more than three quarter of an inch it deserv our interest
attent the tawni wing ar so mark with broad margin of dark
brown that thei show the tawni ting chiefli in the middl space
on account of it small size and it retir habit thi littl
butterfli is often overlook by all but the most experienc
collector it gener fli slowli just abov the grass in sunni
place in wet meadow and along the open margin of brook and
marsh it rest frequent upon grass flower or bush mr
scudder notic that when rest these butterfli have the curiou
habit of move their antenna in a small circl the motion of the
two altern that is when on is move in a forward direct
the other is pass in a revers direct thi is the sort of
observ that should challeng us all to sharper wit in watch
live butterfli it would be strang if no other thu twirl
their feeler in their leisur moment who will find out
the femal butterfli at least have someth to do besid sip
the nectar of flower or idli twirl their feeler thei must lai
their egg and thu provid for the continu of the speci to do
thi thei find suitabl blade of grass on which thei deposit their
tini halfround smooth yellow egg a week or so later each egg
hatch into a dumpi littl yellow caterpillar with a black head and a
bodi well cover with hairi bristl thi littl creatur is a silk
spinner and make a home instinct by draw togeth more or
less the outer edg of a leaf blade and fasten them with
transvers band of silk it then feed upon the green tissu and as
it grow larger it make it nest more secur by thicker wall of
silken web
when full grown as a caterpillar it chang into a slender chrysali
gener of a grayish red color thickli dot with black about ten
dai later it emerg as a butterfli
the least skipper is on of the most wide distribut of all
butterfli it occur from new england to texa south to florida on
the east coast and west to the rocki mountain
