prefac
a lover of natur feel the fascin of the fern though he mai know
littl of their name and habit behold them in their nativ haunt
adorn the rug cliff gracefulli fring the watercours or
wave their state frond on the border of woodland he feel their
call to a closer acquaint happi would he be to receiv instruct
from a live teacher hi next prefer would be the companionship of a
good fern book such a help we aim to give him in thi manual if he will
con it dilig consult it glossari for the mean of term while
he quicken hi power of observ by studi real specimen he mai
hope to learn the name and chief qualiti of our most common fern in a
singl season
our most product period in fern literatur wa between 1878 when
williamson publish hi fern of kentucki and 1905 when clute
issu our fern in their haunt between these flourish dc eaton
davenport water dodg parson eastman underwood aa eaton slosson
and other all their work ar now out of print except clute just
mention and mr parson how to know the fern both of these
ar valuabl handbook and ampli illustr clute is larger more
scholarli and more inclus of rare speci with an illustr kei to
the genera while mr parson is more simpl and popular with a naiv
charm that creat for it a constant demand
we trust there is room also for thi unpretenti but progress
handbook design to stimul interest in the fern and to aid the
averag student in learn their name and mean it geograph
limit includ the northeastern state and canada it nomenclatur follow
in the main the seventh edit of grai manual while the emend
set forth in rhodora of octob 1919 and also a few term of later
adopt ar embodi either as synonym or substitut for the more
familiar latin name of the manual and ar indic by a differ type
in everi case the student ha befor him both the older and the more recent
term from which to choos howev sinc the book is written primarili
for lover of natur mani of whom ar unfamiliar with scientif term
the common english name ar everywher given promin and strang to
sai ar less subject to chang and controversi than the latin there is
no doubt what speci is meant when on speak of the christma fern the
ostrich fern the long beech fern the interrupt fern etc the us of
the common name will lead to the knowledg and enjoy of the scientif
term
a friend unfamiliar with latin ha ask for pointer to aid in pronounc
the scientif name of fern follow grai wood and other we have
mark each accent syllabl with either the grave or acut
accent the former show that the vowel over which it stand ha it long
sound while the latter indic the short or modifi sound let it be
rememb that ani syllabl with either of these mark over it is the
accent syllabl whose sound will be long or short accord to the slant
of the mark
we have appropri from mani sourc such materi as suit our purpos
our interest in fern date back to our colleg dai at amherst when we
collect our first specimen in a rough bushi swamp in hadlei we found
here a fine coloni of the climb fern lygodium we recal the slender
frond climb over the low bush uniqu twiner charm inde in
their nativ habitat we have sinc collect and studi specimen of
nearli everi new england fern and have carefulli examin most of the
other speci mention in thi book by courtesi of the librarian mr
william p rich we have made larg us of the famou davenport herbarium
in the massachusett horticultur librari and through the kind of
the daughter miss mari e davenport we have freeli consult the larger
unmount collect of fern at the davenport homestead at medford1
find here a veri larg and fine assort of botrychium includ a
real b ternatum from japan
footnot 1 recent donat to the grai herbarium
for numer fact and suggest we ar indebt to the twenti volum of
the fern bulletin and also to it abl editor mr willard n clute to
him we ar greatli oblig for the us of photograph and plate and
especi for help counsel on mani item we appreci the help
of the american fern journal and it oblig editor mr ej winslow
to our friend mr ch knowlton our thank ar due for the revis of
the checklist and for much help advic and we ar grate to mr

help inspect of the entir manuscript
the illustr have been carefulli select mani of them from origin
neg bequeath to the author by hi friend henri lincoln clapp
pioneer and chief promot of school garden in america some have been

introduct
thoreau tell us natur made a fern for pure leav fern leav ar in
the highest order of cryptogam like those of flower plant thei ar
reinforc by woodi fibr run through their stem keep them erect
while permit grace curv their exquisit symmetri of form their
frequent fine cut border and their rich shade of green combin to make
them object of rare beauti while their uniqu vernat and method of
fruit along with their wonder mysteri of reproduct invest them
with mark scientif interest afford stimulu and cultur to the
thought mind by peculiar enchant these charm plant allur the
ardent naturelov to observ their haunt and habit
oh then most gracefulli thei wave
in the forest like a sea
and dear as thei ar beauti
ar these fern leav to me
as a rule the larger and coarser fern grow in moist shadi situat as
swamp ravin and damp wood while the smaller on ar more apt to be
found along mountain rang in some dry and even expos local a tini
crevic in some high cliff is not infrequ chosen by these fascin
littl plant which protect themselv from drought by assum a mantl
of light wool or of hair and chaff with perhap a cover of white
powder as in some cloak fernsthu keep a layer of moist air next to
the surfac of the leaf and check transpir
some of the rocklov fern in dry place ar known as resurrect
fern reviv after their leav have turn sere and brown a touch of
rain and lo thei ar green and flourish
fern vari in height from the diminut filmi fern of less than an inch
to the vast tree fern of the tropic reach a height of sixti feet or
more
reproduct
fern ar propag in variou wai a frequent method is by perenni
rootstock which often creep beneath the surfac send up it mai be
singl frond as in the common bracken or grace leafcrown as in the
cinnamon fern the bladder fern is propag in part from it bulblet
while the walk leaf bend over to the earth and root at the tip
illustr male shield fern fern reproduct by the prothallium
fern ar also reproduc by spore a process mysteri and marvel as
a fairi tale instead of seed the fern produc spore which ar littl
onecel bodi without an embryo and mai be liken to bud a
spore fall upon damp soil and germin produc a small green
shieldshap patch much smaller than a dime which is call a prothllium
or prothallu on it under surfac delic root hair grow to give it
stabil and nutriment also two sort of reproduct organ known as
antherdia and archegnia the male and femal growth analog to the
stamen and pistil in flower from the former spring small activ
spiral bodi call ntherozid which lash about in the moistur of
the prothllium until thei find the archegnia the cell of which ar so
arrang in each case as to form a tube around the central cell which is
call the sphere or eggcel the point to be fertil when on
of the enter ntherozid reach thi point the desir chang is
effect and the canal of the archegnium close the empti sphere
becom the quicken sphore whose newli begotten plant germ unfold
normal by the multipl of cell that becom in turn root stem
first leaf etc while the prothllium no longer need to sustain it
offspr wither away1
footnot 1 in the accompani illustr it should be rememb that
the reproduct part of a fern ar microscop and cannot be seen by the
nake ey
fern plant have been known to spring directli from the prothllu by a
bud process apart from the organ of fertil show that natur
fulfil herself in mani ways2
footnot 2 the scientif term for thi method of reproduct is apgami
apart from marriag sometim the prothallu itself bud directli from
the frond without spore for which process the term apspori is us
mean liter without spore
vernat
all true fern come out of the ground head foremost coil up like a
watchspr and ar design as fiddlehead or crosier a real
crosier is a bishop staff some of these odd young growth ar cover
with fern wool which bird often us in line their nest thi wool
usual disappear later as the crosier unfold into the broad green blade
the develop of plant shoot from the bud is call vernat latin
ver mean spring and thi uniqu uncoil of fern circinn
vernat
vein
the vein of a fern ar free when branch from the midvein thei do
not connect with each other and simpl when thei do not fork when
the vein intersect thei ar said to anastomos greek an open or
network and their mesh ar call arol or reol latin areola a
littl open space
explan of term
a frond is said to be pinnat latin pinna a feather when it primari
divis extend to the rachi as in the christma fern fig 1 a frond
is bipinn latin bi twice when the lobe of the pinn extend to
the midvein as in the royal fern fig 2 these divis of the pinn ar
call pinnul when a frond is tripnnat the last complet divis ar
call ultim pinnul or segment a frond is pinntifid when it lobe
extend halfwai or more to the rachi or midvein as in the middl lobe
of the pinntifid spleenwort fig 3 the pinn of a frond ar often
pinntifid when the frond itself is pinnat and a frond mai be pinnat
in it lower part and becom pinntifid higher up as in the pinntifid
spleenwort just mention fig 3
illustr fig 1
illustr fig 2
illustr fig 3
the divis of a pinntifid leaf ar call segment of a bipinntifid
or tripinntifid leaf ultim segment
sporngia and fruit dot
fern spore ar form in littl sac known as sporecas or sporngia
fig 4 thei ar usual cluster in dot or line on the back or margin
of a frond either on or at the end of a small vein or in spikelik
racem on separ stalk sori singular soru a heap or fruit dot
mai be nake as in the polypodi but ar usual cover with a thin
delic membran known as the indusium greek a dress or mantl the
famili or genu of a fern is often determin by the shape of it indusium
eg the indusium of the woodsia is starshap of the dicksonia
cupshap of the asplenium linear of the wood fern kidneyshap
etc
illustr fig 4
in mani fern the sporangia ar surround in whole or in part by a
vertic elast ring annulu remind on of a small brown worm
close coil fig 4 as the spore matur the ring contract and
burst with consider forc scatter the spore the spore of the
differ genera matur at differ time from mai to septemb a good
time to collect fern is just befor the fruit season for time of
fruit see individu descript or chronolog chart on page 220

pick your fern leaf down close to the rootstock includ a portion of
that also if it can be spare place your frond between newspap sheet
and lai dryer over them blot paper or other absorb paper cover
with a board or slat frame and lai on thi a weight of sever pound
leav it for twentyfour hour if the specimen ar not then cure
chang the dryer mount the prepar specimen on white mount sheet

it is well to jot down import memoranda at the time of collect thi
is the method in us at the grai herbarium in cambridg it can of cours
be modifi to suit on own tast or conveni the young collector can
begin by simpli press hi specimen between the leav of a book
the older and coarser the better and he can mount them in a blank book
design for the purpos or if he ha onli a common blank book he can cut
out some of the leav altern with other left in place as is often
done with a scrap book that when the book is full it mai not be crowd at
the back or he can us sheet of blank paper of ani uniform size and mount
the specimen on these with gum strip and then group them place
those of the same genu togeth such an extempor herbarium though
crude will serv for a begin while stimul hi interest and
advanc hi knowledg of the fern let him collect press and mount
as mani varieti as possibl give the name with date and place of
collect etc such a first attempt mai be kept as a remind of pleasant
hour spent in learn the rudiment of a delight studi
we cannot insist too strongli upon the necess of handl and studi
the live plant everi student need to observ for himself the haunt
habit and structur of real fern we would sai to the young student
while familiar yourself with the english name of the fern do not
neglect the scientif name which often hold the kei to their mean
repeat over and over the name of each genu in soliloqui and in
convers until your mind instantli associ each fern with it famili
nameadiantum polystichum asplenium and all the rest fix
them in the memori for a perman asset with hard studi and grow
knowledg will come grow attach how our great expert mr
davenport love the fern he would handl them with gentl touch fondli

the student should have some idea of the term genu speci and
varieti although thei ar not capabl of exact definit
a speci or kind is in botani the unit of classif it embrac
all such individu as mai have origin in a common stock such
individu bear an essenti resembl to each other as well as to
their common parent in all their part eg the cinnamon fern is a kind
or speci of fern with the frond evid of on kind and of a common
origin and all produc individu of their own kind by their spore or
rootstock when such individu differ percept from the type in the
shape of the pinn or the cut of the frond we have varieti as
frondsum incsum etc or if the differ is less strike the
word form is us instead of varieti but in ani given case opinion mai
differ in respect to the more fit term
a genu is an assemblag of speci close relat to each other and
have more point of resembl than of differ eg the royal fern
the cinnamon fern and the interrupt fern ar alik in have similar
spore case born in a somewhat similar manner on the frond and form
the genu osmunda in like manner certain member of the clover
groupr white yellow etc make up the genu trifolium
thu individu ar group into speci and speci ar associ into
genera and the two group ar unit to give each fern or plant it true
name the gener name be qualifi by that of the speci as in the
cinnamon fern osmnda genu cinnammea speci

the petrifi fern
in a vallei centuri ago
grew a littl fernleaf green and slender
vein delic and fiber tender
wave when the wind crept down so low
rush tall and moss and grass grew round it
play sunbeam dart in and found it
drop of dew stole down by night and crown it
but no foot of man eer came that wai
earth wa young and keep holidai
monster fish swam the silent main
state forest wave their giant branch
mountain hurl their snowi avalanch
mammoth creatur stalk across the plain
natur revel in grand mysteri
but the littl fern wa not of these
did not slumber with the hill and tree
onli grew and wave it wild sweet wai
no on came to note it dai by dai
earth on time put on a frolic mood
heav the rock and chang the mighti motion
of the deep strong current of the ocean
move the plain and shook the haughti wood
crush the littl fern in soft moist clai
cover it and hid it safe awai
oh the long long centuri sinc that dai
oh the chang oh life bitter cost
sinc the useless littl fern wa lost
useless lost there came a thought man
search natur secret far and deep
from a fissur in a rocki steep
he withdrew a stone oer which there ran
fairi pencil a quaint design
leafag vein fiber clear and fine
and the fern life lai in everi line
