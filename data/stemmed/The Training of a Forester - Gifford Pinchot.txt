friend and fellow worker
to whom is due more than to ani other man the
high effici of the unit state forest servic
prefac
at on time or anoth the largest question befor everi young man is
what shall i do with my life among the possibl open which best
suit hi ambit hi tast and hi capac along what line
shall he undertak to make a success career the search for a life
work and the choic of on is sure as import busi as can occupi
a boi verg into manhood it is to help in the decis of those who
ar consid forestri as a profess that thi littl book ha been
written
to the young man who is attract to forestri and begin to consid it
as a possibl profess certain question present themselv what is
forestri if he take it up what will hi work be and where doe it
in fact offer the satisfi type of outdoor life which it appear to
offer what chanc doe it present for a success career for a career
of genuin us and what is the chanc to make a live is he
fit for it in charact mind and bodi if so what train doe he
need these question deserv an answer
to the men whom it realli suit forestri offer a career more
attract it mai be said in all fair than ani other career
whatsoev i doubt if ani other profess can show a membership so
uniformli and enthusiast in love with the work the men who have
taken it up practis it and left it for other work ar few but to
the man not fulli adapt for it forestri must be punish pure and
simpl those who have begun the studi of forestri and then have
learn that it wa not for them have doubtless been more in number
than those who have follow it through
i urg no man to make forestri hi profess but rather to keep awai
from it if he can in forestri a man is either altogeth at home or
veri much out of place unless he ha a compel love for the
forest life and the forest work let him keep out of it

the train of a forest
what is a forest
first what is forestri forestri is the knowledg of the forest in
particular it is the art of handl the forest so that it will render
whatev servic is requir of it without be impoverish or
destroi for exampl a forest mai be handl so as to produc saw
log telegraph pole barrel hoop firewood tan bark or turpentin
the main purpos of it treatment mai be to prevent the wash of soil
to regul the flow of stream to support cattl or sheep or it mai
be handl so as to suppli a wide rang and combin of us
forestri is the art of produc from the forest whatev it can yield
for the servic of man
befor we can understand forestri certain fact about the forest itself
must be kept in mind a forest is not a mere collect of individu
tree just as a citi is not a mere collect of unrel men and
women or a nation like our mere a certain number of independ
racial group a forest like a citi is a complex commun with a life
of it own it ha a soil and an atmospher of it own chemic and
physic differ from ani other with plant and shrub as well as
tree which ar peculiar to it it ha a resid popul of insect
and higher anim entir distinct from that outsid most import
of all from the forest point of view the member of the forest
live in an exact and intric system of competit and mutual
assist of help or harm which extend to all the inhabit of
thi complic citi of tree
the tree in a forest ar all help by mutual protect each other
against high wind and by produc a richer and moister soil than
would be possibl if the tree stood singli and apart thei compet
among themselv by their root for moistur in the soil and for light
and space by the growth of their crown in height and breadth perhap
the strongest weapon which tree have against each other is growth in
height in certain speci intoler of shade the tree which is
overtop ha lost the race for good the number of young tree which
destroi each other in thi fierc struggl for exist is prodigi
so that often a few score per acr ar all that surviv to middl or old
ag out of mani ten of thousand of seedl which enter the race of
life on approxim even term
not onli ha a forest a charact of it own which aris from the fact
that it is a commun of tree but each speci of tree ha peculiar
characterist and habit also just as in new york citi for exampl
the french the german the italian the hungarian and the chines
each have quarter of their own and in those quarter live in
accord with habit which distinguish each race from all the other
so the differ speci of pine and hemlock oak and mapl prefer
and ar found in certain definit type of local and live in
accord with definit racial habit which ar as gener and
unfail as the racial characterist which distinguish for exampl
the italian from the german or the swede from the chines
the most import of these characterist of race or speci ar those
which ar concern with the relat of each to light heat and
moistur thu a river birch will die if it ha onli as much water as
will suffic to keep a post oak in the best condit and the warm
climat in which the balsam fir would perish is just suit to the
requir of a long leaf pine or a magnolia
the toler of a tree for shade mai vari greatli at differ time of
it life but a white pine alwai requir more light than a hemlock
and a beech throughout it life will flourish with less sunshin or
reflect light than for exampl an oak or a tulip tree
tree ar limit in their distribut also by their adapt in
which thei vari greatli thu a bald cypress will grow both in wetter
and in dryer land than an oak a red cedar will flourish from florida to
the canadian line while other speci like the eastern larch the
western mountain hemlock or the big tree of california ar confin
in their nativ local within extrem narrow limit
the forest knowledg
the train forest must know the forest as a doctor know the human
machin first of all he must be abl to distinguish the differ
tree of which the forest is compos for that is like learn to
read he must know the wai thei ar made and the wai thei grow but far
more import than all els he must base hi knowledg upon that part
of forestri which is call silvic the knowledg of the relat of
tree to light heat and moistur to the soil and to each other
the welltrain forest must also know the forest shrub and at least
the more import smaller forest plant someth of the insect and
anim life of hi domain and the bird and fish he must have a good
work knowledg of rock soil and stream and of the method of
make road trail and bridg he should be an expert in woodcraft
abl to travel the forest safe and sure by dai or by night it is
essenti that he should have a knowledg of the theori and the practic
of lumber and he should know someth about lumber market and the
valu of lumber about survei and map make and mani other matter
which ar consid more at length in the chapter on train there
ar as yet in america compar few men who have acquir even
fairli well the more import knowledg which should be includ in the
train of a forest
the forest and the nation
the posit of the forest in the housekeep of ani nation is unlik
that of ani other great natur resourc for the forest not onli
furnish wood without which civil as we know it would be
imposs but serv also to protect or make valuabl mani of the
other thing without which we could not get on thu the forest cover
protect the soil from the effect of wind and hold it in place for
lack of it hundr of thousand of squar mile have been convert by
the wind from moder fertil product land to arid drift
sand narrow strip of forest plant as windbreak make agricultur
possibl in certain region by prevent destruct of crop by
moisturest dry wind which so afflict the central portion of our
countri
without the forest the great bulk of our mine for coal metal and
the preciou miner would be either imposs or vastli more
expens than it is at present becaus the galleri of mine ar
prop with wood and so protect against cave in so far no
satisfactori substitut for the wooden railroad tie ha been devis
and our whole system of land transport is directli depend for
it exist upon the forest which suppli more than on hundr and
twenti million new railroad ti everi year in the unit state alon
the forest regul and protect the flow of stream it effect is to
reduc the height of flood and to moder extrem of low water the
offici measur of the unit state geolog survei have
final settl thi longdisput question by protect mountain
slope against excess soil wash it protect also the lowland upon
which thi wash would otherwis be deposit and the river whose
channel it would clog it is well within the truth to sai that the
util of ani system of river for transport for irrig for
waterpow and for domest suppli depend in great part upon the
protect which forest offer to the headwat of the stream and
that without such protect none of these us can be expect long to
endur
of the two basic materi of our civil iron and wood the
forest suppli on the domin place of the forest in our nation
economi is well illustr by the fact that no articl whatsoev
whether of us or ornament whether it be for food shelter cloth
conveni protect or decor can be produc and deliv to
the user as industri is now organ without the help of the forest
in suppli wood an examin of the histori of ani articl
includ the product of the raw materi and it manufactur
transport and distribut will at onc make thi point clear
the forest is a nation necess without the materi the
protect and the assist it suppli no nation can long succe
mani region of the old world such as palestin greec northern
africa and central india offer in themselv the most impress
object lesson of the effect upon nation prosper and nation
charact of the neglect of the forest and it consequ destruct
the forest point of view
the central idea of the forest in handl the forest is to promot
and perpetu it greatest us to men hi purpos is to make it serv
the greatest good of the greatest number for the longest time befor
the member of ani other profess deal with natur resourc the
forest acquir the long look ahead thi wa onli natur becaus
in forestri it is seldom that a man live to harvest the crop which he
help to sow the forest must look forward becaus the natur
resourc with which he deal matur so slowli and becaus if step
ar to be taken to insur for succeed gener a suppli of the
thing the forest yield thei must be taken long in advanc the idea
of us the forest first for the greatest good of the present
gener and then for the greatest good of succeed gener
through the long futur of the nation and the racethat is the
forest point of view
the us of foresight to insur the exist of the forest in the
futur and so far as practic the continu or increas
abund of it servic to men natur suggest the us of
foresight in the same wai as to other natur resourc as well thu it
wa the forest point of view appli not onli to the forest but to
the land the miner and the stream which produc the
conserv polici the idea of appli foresight and commonsens to
the other natur resourc as well as to the forest wa natur and
inevit it work out equal as a matter of cours into the
concept of a plan and orderli develop of all that the earth
contain for the us of men thi lead in turn to the applic of
the same principl to other question and resourc it wa foreseen
from the begin by those who were respons for inaugur the
conserv movement that it natur develop would in time work
out into a plan and orderli scheme for nation effici base on
the elimin of wast and direct toward the best us of all we
have for the greatest good of the greatest number for the longest time
it is easi to see that thi principl the forest principl first
brought to public attent by forest is the kei to nation
success
forestri then is seen to be peculiarli essenti to the nation
prosper both now and hereaft nation degrad and decai have
uniformli follow the excess destruct of forest by other
nation and will inevit becom our portion if we continu to
destroi our forest three time faster than thei ar produc as we ar
do now the principl of forestri therefor must occupi a
command place in determin the futur prosper or failur of our
nation and thi command posit in the field of idea is natur
and properli reflect in the digniti and high stand which the
profess of forestri young as it is ha alreadi acquir in the
unit state thi posit it must be the first care of everi member
of the profess to maintain and increas
in the long run no profess rise higher than the degre of public
consider which mark it member the profess of forestri is in
mani wai a peculiarli respons profess but in noth more so
than in it vital connect with the whole futur welfar of our
countri and in the oblig which li upon it member to see that
it reput and stand which ar the measur of it capac for
us ar kept strong and clear
the establish of forestri
in the unit state forestri is pass out of the pioneer phase of
agit and the educ of public opinion and into the perman
phase of the practic of the profess the first step in forestri in
thi countri as in ani other where the develop and destruct of
natur resourc ha been rapid were necessarili direct mainli to
inform the public mind upon the import of forestri and to
build up nation and state law and organ for the protect
of timberland set asid for the public benefit the right to be heard
with respect by the men who were alreadi in control of the larger part
of our total forest wealth had to be won and ha been won what is
more in the teeth of the bitterest opposit of privat special
interest the right of the public to first consider in the
protect and develop of the forest and of all the resourc it
contain had to be assert and establish that ha now been done
in the unit state these step in the movement for the wise us of the
forest have been taken mainli in the last dozen or fifteen year dure
which the feder forest organ ha grown from an insignific
divis of less than a dozen men to the present unit state forest
servic of more than three thousand member dure thi period also
forestri both as a profess and as a public necess ha won
endur public recognit and at the same time more public timberland
ha been set asid for the public us and to remain in the public hand
than dure all the rest of our histori put togeth todai the
nation forest ar reason safe in the protect of public
opinion not against all attack it is true but against ani success
attempt to dismemb and turn them over to the special interest who
alreadi control the bulk and the best of our forest the public ha
accept forestri as necessari to the public welfar both in the
present and in the futur state forest organ ar spring up
forestri ha won the right to be heard in the busi offic as well
as in the convent of the privat owner of forest land and the
time for the practic of the profess ha fulli come
the work of a forest
what doe a forest do i will try to answer thi question first with
refer to the unit state forest servic and later as to the
numer other field of activ which ar open or have alreadi
open to the train forest in the unit state
the forest servic
the unit state forest servic is respons both for the gener
progress of forestri so far as the unit state govern is
concern and for the protect and us of the nation forest these
nation forest now cover an area of on hundr and eightyseven
million acr or as much land as is includ in all the new england
state with new york pennsylvania new jersei delawar maryland
virginia and west virginia the head of the servic whose offici
titl is forest is charg with the great task of protect thi
vast area against fire theft and other depred and of make all
it resourc the wood water and grass the miner and the soil
avail and us to the peopl of the unit state under
regul which will secur develop and prevent destruct or
wast
the unit state forest servic consist first of a protect forc
of forest guard and forest ranger who spend practic the whole of
their time in the forest second of an execut staff of forest
supervisor and their assist who have immedi charg of the
handl of the nation forest and third of an administr staff
divid between headquart in washington and the six local
administr offic in the west where the nation forest mainli
lie
the work of a forest ranger is first of all to protect the district
commit to hi charg against fire that come befor all els for
that purpos the ranger patrol hi district dure the season when
fire ar danger or watch for sign of fire from certain high
point call firelookout or both he keep the trail and fire
line clear and the telephon in work order and see to it that the
fire fight tool such as spade ax and rake ar in good
condit and readi for servic if he is wise he establish such
relat with the peopl who live in hi neighborhood that thei becom
hi volunt assist in watch for forest fire in take
precaut against them and in notifi him of them when thei do take
place illustr string a forest telephon line
fight a forest fire in some respect is like fight a fire in a
citi in both the first and most necessari thing is to get men and
apparatu to the site of the fire at the first practic moment for
thi purpos fireengin and men ar alwai readi in the citi while
in the forest the telephon trail and bridg must be kept in
condit and the forest offic must be readi to move instantli dai
or night
it is far better to prevent a forest fire from start than to have to
put it out after it ha start but in spite of all the care that can
be exercis with the mean at hand mani fire start each year the
forest servic men extinguish not less than three thousand fire nearli
all of them while thei ar still small at time howev when the
wood ar veri dry and the wind blow hard in spite of all that can be
done a fire will grow larg enough to be danger not onli to the
forest but to human life thu in the summer of 1910 the driest ever
known in certain part of the west high wind drove the forest fire
clear beyond the control of the fire fighter mani of whom were
compel to fight for their own live
the worst of these fire were in montana and idaho where the whole
power of the forest servic wa us against them the forest ranger
under the order of their supervisor immedi organ or took
charg of small compani of fire fighter and began the work of
get them under control but so fierc wa the wind and so terribl
the heat of the fire and the speed with which thei move that in mani
place it becam a question of save the live of the fire fighter
rather than of put out the fire as a matter of fact nearli a
hundr of the men temporarili emploi to help the govern fire
fighter lost their live and mani more would have di but for the
courag resourc and knowledg of the wood of the forest ranger
take for exampl the case of ranger edward c pulaski of the coeur
dalen nation forest station at wallac idaho pulaski had charg
of forti italian and pole he had been at work with them for mani
hour when the flame grew to be so threaten that it becam a
question of whether he could save hi men the fire wa travel
faster than the men could make their wai through the dens forest and
the onli hope wa to find some place into which the fire could not come
accordingli pulaski guid hi parti at a run through the blind smoke
to an abandon mine he knew of in the neighborhood when thei reach
it he sent the men into the work ahead of him hung a wet blanket
across the mouth of the tunnel and himself stood there on guard the
fierc heat the stifl air and their deadli fear drove some of the
foreign temporarili insan and a number of them tri to break out
with drawn revolv pulaski held them back on man did get by him and
wa burn to death mani faint in the tunnel the ranger himself
more expos than ani of hi men wa terribl burn he stood at hi
post howev for five hour until the fire had pass and brought
hi parti through without lose a singl man except that on who got
out of the tunnel although hi own injuri were so sever that he wa
in the hospit for two month as a result of them the record of the
forest servic in these terribl fire is on of which everi forest
mai well be proud
the ranger must protect hi district not onli against fire but against
the theft of timber and the incess effort of land grabber to steal
govern land to prevent the theft of timber is usual not
difficult but it is far harder to prevent fake homestead fraudul
mine men and other dishonest claimant from seiz upon land to
which thei have no right and so prevent honest men from us these
claim to make a live
in the past thi problem ha present the most seriou difficulti
and still occasion doe so there is no louder shouter for justic
than a balk habitu land thief with polit influenc behind him
to illustr the kind of attack upon the forest servic to which
fraudul land claim have constantli given rise i mai cite the
statement made dure on of the annual attempt in the senat to break
down the servic on of the senat assert that in hi state the
forest servic wa overbear and tyrann and that in a particular
case it had driven out of hi home a citizen known to the senat and
had left him and hi famili to wander houseless upon the hillsid and
that for no good reason whatsoev
thi statement if it had been true would at onc have destroi the
stand of the servic in the mind of mani of it friend and would
have led to immedi defeat in the fight then go on fortun
the record of the servic were so complet and the knowledg of field
condit on the part of the men in washington wa so thorough that
the mere mention of the gener local of the suppos outrag by the
senat made it easi to identifi the individu case the man in
question instead of be an honest settler with a wife and famili wa
the keeper of a disreput saloon and danc hall a wellknown
lawbreak whom the local author had tri time and again to
dispossess and drive awai but by mean of hi fraudul claim the man
had alwai defeat the local offic when howev the offic of
the forest servic took the case in hand the situat chang and
thing move quickli the disreput saloon wa promptli remov from
the fraudul land claim by mean of which the keeper of it had held
on and thi thoroughli undesir citizen either went out of busi
or remov hi abomin trade to some local outsid the nation
forest
the actual fact were fulli brought out in the debat next dai remain
uncontradict and save the fight for the forest servic the whole
incid mai be found at length in the congression record
the forest ranger is charg with overse and regul the free us
of timber by settler and other who live in or near the nation
forest last year 1912 the forest servic gave awai without charg
more than 196000 worth of saw timber hous log fenc fuel and
other materi to men and women who need it for their own us usual
it is the ranger work to issu the permit for thi free us and to
design the timber that mai be cut for thi purpos he must be well
acquaint with the kind and the us of the tree in hi district and
it is most import that he should know someth of how their
reproduct can best be secur in order that the free us mai be
permit without injuri to the futur welfar of the forest
a ranger overse the us of hi district for the graze of cattl
sheep and other domest anim he must acquaint himself with the
brand and mark of the variou owner and should be well post in the
essenti of the busi of rais cattl sheep and hors the
allot of graze area is on of the most difficult problem to
adjust becaus the demand is almost alwai for much more rang than is
avail and the divis of what rang there is among the local owner
of stock often present seriou difficulti in which the ranger
local knowledg and advic is constantli sought by hi superior offic
there is a wise law pass at the request of the forest servic under
which land in the nation forest which is shown to be agricultur mai
be enter under the homestead law and us for the make of home
thi law is peculiarli hard to carri out becaus the ceaseless effort
of land grabber to misus it demand great vigil on the part of the
forest offic in mani case it is the ranger who make the report
upon which the decis as to the agricultur or nonagricultur
charact of the land is base although in other case the
examin to determin whether the land is realli agricultur in
charact ar made by examin especi train for thi duti
seriou controversi into which polit enter ar often caus by the
effort of specul and other under pretext of thi law to get
possess of land chiefli valuabl for their timber
the build and mainten of trail telephon line road bridg
and fenc in hi district is under the charg of the ranger and in
mani case ranger and forest guard ar appoint by the state as
warden to see to it that the game and fish law ar properli enforc
next to the protect of hi district from fire the most import
duti of the ranger ha to do with the sale of timber and the mark of
the individu tree which ar to be cut the reproduct of the forest
depend directli on what tree ar kept for seed or on how the
exist young growth is protect and preserv in fell and swamp
the tree which have been mark for cut and in skid the log
the dispos of the slash must be look after for it ha much to do
with forest reproduct and with promot safeti from fire then the
scale of the log determin the amount of the payment the govern
receiv for it timber and there ar often regul govern the
transport of the scale log whose enforc is of great
consequ to the futur forest
illustr forest ranger scale timber
nearli all of these duti the ranger mai perform in certain case
without supervis if hi judgment and train ar suffici but
the mark especi is often done under the ey or in accord with
the direct of the technic forest whose duti it is to see that
the futur of the forest is protect by enforc the condit of
sale
these ar but a part of the duti of the ranger for he is concern
with all the us which hi district mai serv the stream for
exampl mai be import for citi water suppli irrig or for
waterpow and their us for these purpos must be under hi ey
hotel and sawmil on site leas from the govern mai dot hi
district here and there the land within nation forest mai be put to
a thousand other us from a bee ranch on the cleveland forest in
southern california to a whale station on the tongass forest in
alaska all of which mean work for him
the result of all thi is that the ranger come in contact with citi
dweller irrig cattlemen sheepmen and horsemen rancher
storekeep hotel men hunter miner and lumbermen and abov all
with the settler who live in or near hi district with all these it is
hi duti to keep on good term for well he know that on man at
certain time can set more fire than a regiment can extinguish and
that the best protect for hi district come from the friendli
interest of the men who live in it or near it
a forest guard is in effect an assist to the ranger and mai be
call upon to carri out most of the duti which fall upon a ranger
the forego short statement will make it clear that preliminari
experi as a ranger mai be of the utmost valu to the man who
propos later on to perform in the govern servic the duti of a
train forest it is becom more and more common and fortun
so for graduat of forest school to begin their work in the unit
state forest servic as ranger or forest guard the man who ha done
well a ranger work like the graduat of an engin school who
after graduat ha enter a machin shop as a hand ha acquir a
bodi of practic inform and experi which will be invalu to
him in the later practic of hi profess and which is far beyond the
reach of ani man who ha not been train in the actual execut of
thi work on the ground and in actual daili contact with the
multifari us and user of the forest
the forest supervisor
illustr western yellow pine seed collect by the forest servic
for plant up denud land
the supervisor is the gener manag of a nation forest the
respons for the protect care and us of it fall upon him
under the direct of the district forest the supervisor is
respons for make the us of hi forest as valuabl and as
conveni as possibl for the peopl in and around the area of which he
ha charg he deal with the organ of forest user such as
local stock associ and issu permit for graze live stock in
the forest permit for cut small amount of timber ar grant by
him and he advertis in the paper the sale of larger amount and
receiv bid from prospect purchas keep the account of hi
forest and make regular report on a varieti of import subject
such as the personnel of hi forest forc the perman improv
made or to be made the permit issu for regular and special us of
the forest and for free us of timber and forag the number and kind
of predatori anim kill the amount of forest plant accomplish
and the expens and loss from forest fire he ha gener oversight
of the road trail and other improv on hi forest and prepar
plan for the extens of them in particular he direct control
and inspect the work of the ranger and guard and in gener he
attend to the thousand and on matter which go to adjust the us of
the forest to the need of the men who us it and on which depend
whether the forest is well or badli thought of among the peopl whose
coper or opposit have so much to do with make it manag
success or otherwis
the supervisor spend about half hi time in the offic and half in the
field inspect the work of hi men and consult with them meet
local resid or associ of local resid who have proposit
to submit for improv the servic of the forest to them or for
correct mistak or who wish to lai befor the supervisor some on
of the numberless matter in which the forest affect their welfar the
us of the supervisor depend as much upon hi good judgment hi
abil to meet men and do busi with them and hi knowledg of
local need and local affair as it doe upon hi knowledg of the
forest itself as in the case of everi superior offic hi attitud
toward hi work hi energi hi good sens and hi good will ar or
should be reflect in the men under him so that hi posit is on of
the greatest import in determin the success or failur of each
nation forest and henc of the forest servic as a whole more and
more of the train forest in the servic ar seek and secur
appoint as forest supervisor becaus of the interest and
satisfact thei find in the work such men handl both the
profession and busi side of forest manag mani of their
duti therefor ar describ in the succeed chapter
the posit of supervisor is in mani respect the most desir a
train forest can occupi in the forest servic and the most
respons of the field posit
the train forest
to each forest where timber cut ha becom import there ar
assign on or more forest assist or forest examin these ar
profession train forest thei ar subordin upon each forest
to the supervisor as manag but it is their work which ha most to do
with decid whether the forest servic in gener is to be success

cours under the direct of the supervisor of whom he becom the
advis on all problem involv technic forestri
the most import task of the train forest on a nation forest
ar the prepar of work plan for the us of the forest by
method which will protect and perpetu it as well and the carri
out of the plan when made thi is forestri in the technic sens of
the word it involv a thorough studi of the kind of timber their
amount and locat their rate of growth their valu the eas or
difficulti of their reproduct and the method by which the timber
can be cut at a profit and at the same time the reproduct of the
forest can be safe secur a work plan usual includ a
consider number of map which often have to be drawn in the first
place from actual survei on the ground by the forest examin these
map contain the inform secur by workingplan studi and ar of
the first necess for the wise and skil handl of the forest
thei often constitut also most import document in the histori of
it condit and us
on mani of the nation forest the need for immedi us of the timber
is so urgent and so just that there is no time to prepar elabor
work plan timber sale must be made and made at onc but thei
must be made nevertheless in a wai that will fulli protect the futur
welfar of the forest whether work plan can be prepar or not a
most import duti of the technic forest is to work out the
condit under which a given bodi of timber can be cut with safeti to
the forest especi with safeti to it reproduct and futur
growth the princip studi for a timber sale will usual includ an
examin of the gener featur and condit of the forest and the
determin of the diamet down to which it is advis to cut the
stand tree a diamet which must be fix at such a size as will
protect the forest and make the lumber pai it will includ also an
investig more or less thorough and complet as the condit
warrant of the silvic habit of on or more of the speci of tree
in that forest the area which form natur unit for the log and
transport of the timber must be work out and laid off and
care estim or measur of the amount of stand timber and
of it valu on the stump must be made as well as of the cost of
move it to the mill or to the railroad
the forest examin must also consid in mani case the build of
log road or railroad timber slide etc and must make a care
studi of the materi into which the tree to be cut can best be work
up and of the valu of such materi in the market most of all
howev he must studi think over and decid what he will recommend as
to the condit which ar to govern the log condit by which
the protect of the forest is to be insur these condit fix
by hi superior upon the report of the forest examin determin
whether an individu timber sale is forestri or forest destruct
thi is the central question in the administr of the nation
forest from the nation point of view
the princip object of the condit laid down for a timber sale ar
alwai the reproduct of the forest and it safeti against fire
natur reproduct from selfsown seed is almost invari the result
desir and so the question of the seed tree to be left and how thei
ar to be locat or space is fundament unless there is ampl young
growth alreadi on the ground in the latter case thi young growth must
not be smash or bent by throw the older tree on top of it or
against it and the young sapl bent down by the fell top must be
promptli releas
in order to avoid danger to the young growth alreadi present or to be
secur as well as to protect the older tree from fire the slash
produc in lumber the top lop from the tree up to and beyond
the highest point to which the lumbermen ar requir to take the log
must be satisfactorili dispos ofeith by scatter it thinli over
the ground by pile and burn or often by pile alon
these and mani other condit of sale must be studi out in a form
adapt to each particular case and must be discuss with the men who
propos to bui who often have wise and practic suggest to make
similar question on a less import scale present themselv and must
be answer in the matter of small timber sale and of timber given
without charg under freeus permit to settler and other
when the term of a contract of sale have been work out and accept
and the timber ha been sold then the forest assist ha charg of
the extrem interest task of mark the tree that ar to be cut
in accord with these term usual thi is done by mark all the
tree which ar to be fell but sometim by mark onli the tree
which ar to remain
the mark is usual done by blaze each tree and stamp the
letter u s upon the blaze with a govern mark ax or hatchet
it must be done in such a wai that the logger will have no excus
either for cut an unmark tree or leav a mark tree uncut or
vice versa as the case mai be the mark mai be carri out by the
ranger and forest guard under supervis of the forest assist or
in difficult situat he mai mark or direct the mark of each tree
himself mark is fascin work
later while the log is under wai the forest examin will often
inspect it to see that the term of the sale ar compli with that the
tree cut ar thrown in place where thei will not unduli damag either
young growth or the larger tree which ar to remain and that the other
condit laid down for the log in the contract of sale ar
observ the scale of the log to determin the amount of payment to
the govern will mani time be under hi supervis although in the
larger sale thi work as well as the routin inspect of the
log is usual carri out by a special bodi of expert lumbermen
who often bring to it a much wider knowledg of the wood than the men
in actual charg of the lumber
in nearli everi nation forest there ar area upon which the tree
have been destroi by fire mani of these ar so larg or so remot
from seedbear tree that natur reproduct will not suffic to
replac the forest in such local plant is need and for that
purpos the forest examin must establish and conduct a forest nurseri
the decis on the kind of tree to plant and on the method of rais
and plant them the collect of the seed the care and
transplant of the young tree until thei ar set out on the site of
the futur forest form a task of absorb interest such work often
requir a high degre of technic skill it is like to occupi a
larger and larger share of the time and attent of the train men of
the forest servic
illustr a forest examin run a compass line
the forest assist or examin knowledg of survei make it
natur for him to take an import part in the lai out of new road
and trail in the forest or in correct the line of old on and
there is littl work more immedi us the forest can be
safeguard effect just in proport to the eas with which all
part of it can be reach forest protect mai be less technic
interest than other part of the forest work but noth that he
doe is more import or pai larger dividend in futur result
in addit to hi studi of the habit and reproduct of the
differ tree for work plan or timber sale or simpli to increas
hi knowledg of the forest the forest examin is often call upon to
lai out sampl plot for ascertain the exact relat of each speci
to light heat and moistur or for studi it rate of growth he mai
find it necessari to determin the effect of the graze of cattl or
sheep on young growth of variou speci and of variou ag or to
ascertain their rel resist to fire in gener what time he
can spare from more press duti is veri fulli occupi with ad
to hi silvic knowledg by observ with studi of injuri
insect or fungi of the reason for the increas or decreas of
valuabl or worthless speci of tree in the forest the innumer
secondari effect of forest fire the caus of the local distribut
of tree or with some other of the thousand question which give a
neverfail interest to work in the wood
the protect of a valuabl kind of tree often depend upon the abil
to find a us for and therefor to remov a lessvalu speci
which is crowd it out for as yet the american forest can do veri
littl cut or thin that doe not pai just so the protect of
a given tract against fire mai depend upon the abil to us and
therefor to remov a part or the whole of the dead and down timber
which now make it a fire trap for such reason as these the us of
wood and the market for it dispos form exceedingli import
branch of studi for the forest examin who will usual find that
hi duti requir him to be thoroughli familiar with them
it is more and more common to find each forest officerrang forest
examin or supervisorcombin in himself the qualiti and the
knowledg requir to fill ani or all of the other posit the
profession train man who develop mark execut abil is
like to becom a supervisor just as a ranger with the necessari
train and experi who mai wish to devot himself to silvic
investig mai be transfer to that work the point is that each
man ha individu opportun to establish and occupi the place for
which he is best fit
the success of the technic forest like that of the ranger and
inde of nearli everi govern forest offic in whatev posit
or line of work will veri frequent depend on hi good judgment and
practic sens the chief ingredi of which will alwai be hi
knowledg of local need and condit and hi sympathet
understand of the local point of view thi doe not mean that the
local point of view is alwai to control on the contrari the forest
offic must often decid against it in the interest of the welfar of
the larger public but the desir and demand of the user of the
forest should alwai be given the fullest hear and the most care
consider to thi rule there is no except whatsoev
person equip
forestri differ from most profess in thi that it requir as much
vigor of bodi as it doe vigor of mind the sort of man to which it
appeal and which it seek is the man with high power of observ
who doe not shrink from respons and whose mental vigor is
balanc by physic strength and hardi the man who take up
forestri should be littl interest in hi own person comfort and
should have and conserv endur enough to stand sever physic work
accompani by mental labor equal exhaust
forest ar still few in number and the point of view which thei
repres while it is make immens stride in public accept is
still far from gener applic therefor forest ar still
missionari in a veri real sens and sinc thei ar so few it is of
the utmost import that thei should stand close togeth
differ of opinion there must alwai be in all profess but
there is no other profess in which it is more import to keep these
differ from work out into animos or separ of ani
kind we ar fortun abov all in thi that american forest ar
unit as probabl the member of no other profess thi esprit de
corp ha given them their greatest power of achiev and ani man
who propos to enter the profess should do so with thi fact clearli
in mind
the high standard which the profess of forestri new in the unit
state ha alreadi reach it great power for us to the
nation now and hereaft and the larg respons which fall so
quickli on the men who ar train to accept ital these thing give
to the profess a posit and digniti which it should be the first
care of everi man who enter it to maintain or increas
to stand well at graduat is or ought to be far less the object of a
forest train than to stand well ten or twenti year after
graduat it is of the first import that the train should be
thorough and complet
a friend of mine john muir sai that the best advic he can give young
men is take time to get rich hi idea of get rich is to fill
hi mind and spirit full with observ of the natur he so deepli
love and so well understand so that in hi mind it is not monei which
make rich but life in the open and the see ey
next to those basic trait of person charact without which no man
is worth hi salt the forest most import qualiti is the power of
observ the power to note and understand or seek to understand
what he see in the forest it is just as essenti a part of the
forest equip to be abl to see what is wrong with a piec of
forest and what is requir for it improv as it is necessari for
a physician to be abl to diagnos a diseas and to prescrib the
remedi
silvic which mai be said to be the knowledg of how tree behav in
health and diseas toward each other and toward light heat moistur
and the soil is the foundat of forestri and the forest first
task is to bring himself to a high point of effici in observ and
interpret these fact of the forest and to keep himself there it
should be as hard work to walk through the forest and see what is there
to be seen as to wrestl with the most difficult problem of
mathemat no man can be a good forest without that qualiti of
observ and understand which the french call the forest
ey it is not the onli qualiti requir for success in forestri but
it is unquestion the first
perhap the second among the qualiti necessari for the forest is
common sens which most often simpli mean a sympathet understand
of the circumst among which a man find himself the american
forest must know the unit state and understand it peopl noth
which affect the welfar of hi countri should be indiffer to him
forestri is a form of practic statesmanship which touch the nation
life at so mani point that no forest can safe allow himself to
remain ignor of the need and purpos of hi fellow citizen or to
be out of touch with the current question of the dai the best citizen
make the best forest and no man can make a good forest unless he
is a good citizen also
the forest can not succe unless he understand the problem and
point of view of hi countri and that is the reason why forest from
other land were not brought into the unit state in the earli stage
of the forest movement at that time practic no american forest
had yet been train and the great need of the situat wa for men to
do the immedi press work forest from germani franc
switzerland and other countri could have been obtain in abund
number and at reason salari thei were not invit to come
becaus howev well train in technic forestri thei could not have
understood the habit of thought of our peopl therefor in too mani
case thei would have fail to establish the kind of practic
understand which a forest must have with the men who us or work
in hi forest if he is to succe it wa wiser to wait until
american could be train for the practis forest must handl men
as well as tree
on of the most difficult thing to do in ani profess which involv
drudgeri and i take it that no profess which doe not involv
drudgeri is worth the attent of a man is to look beyond the daili
routin to the thing which that routin is intend to assist in
accomplish thi is peculiarli true of forestri in which perhap
more than in ani other profess the longdist farsight
attitud of mind is essenti to success the tree a forest plant he
himself will seldom live to harvest much of hi thought about hi
forest must be in term of centuri the great object for which he is
strive of necess can not be fulli accomplish dure hi lifetim
he must therefor accustom himself to look ahead and to reap hi
person satisfact from the plan and orderli develop of a
scheme the perfect fruit of which he can never hope to see
thi is on of the strongest reason why the forest whether in public
or privat employ must alwai look upon himself as a public
servant it is of the first import that he should accustom himself
to think of the result of hi work as affect not primarili himself
but other alwai includ the gener public it is essenti for a
forest to form the habit of look far ahead out of which grow a
sound perspect and persist in bodi and mind
on of the greatest footbal player of our time make the distinct
between a player who is quick and a player who is soon in hi
descript the quick player is the man who wait until the last
moment and then move with nervou and desper hast in the littl
time he ha left the man who is soon howev almost invari
arriv ahead of the man who is quick becaus he ha thought out in
advanc exactli where he is go and how to get there and when the
moment come he doe not delai hi start make no fals motion and
therebi make and keep himself effici forestri is premin a
profess for the soon man for it is the steadi prepar long in
advanc the wellthoughtout plan well stuck to which in forestri
bring success
in my experi men differ compar littl in mere abil in
the qualiti of the mental machin through which the spirit work nine
time out of ten it is not abil which bring success but
persist and enthusiasm which ar usual but not alwai the same
as vision and will we all have abil enough to do the thing which
lie befor us but the man with the will to keep everlastingli at it
and the vision to realiz the mean and valu of the result for which
he is strive is the man who win in nearli everi case thi is true
in all human affair but it is peculiarli true of the forest and hi
task the end of which li so far ahead
in a class below me at phillipsexet academi wa a boi who had just
enter the school hi great ambit wa to plai footbal and he
came to the practis dai after dai hi abil howev were
appar not on the same plane with hi ambit and hi work wa so
ridicul poor that he becam the laugh stock of the whole school
that howev troubl him not at all what held hi mind wa footbal
undiscourag and undismai he kept on plai footbal until in hi
last year he becam captain of the exet footbal team
everi man of experi ha known mani similar case it is clear i
think that the master qualiti in achiev ar neither luck nor
mere abil but rather enthusiasm and persist or vision and will
in a peculiar sens the forest depend upon public opinion and public
support for the mean of carri on hi work and for it final
success but the attent which the public give or can give to ani
particular subject vari and of necess must vari from time to
time under these circumst it is inevit that the forest must
meet discourag check and delai as well as period of smooth
sail he should expect them and should be prepar to discount them
when thei come when thei do come i know of no better wai of reduc
their bad effect than for a man to make allow for hi own state of
mind he who can stand off and look at himself imparti realiz
that he will not feel tomorrow as he feel todai ha a power
weapon against the temporari discourag which ar necessarili met
in ani work that is realli worth while progress is alwai in spiral
and there is alwai a good time come there is noth so fatal to
good work as that flabbi spirit under which some weak men try to hide
their inefficiencyth spirit of what the us
it ha been the experi of everi forest as he goe about the
countri to be told that a certain mountain is impass that a
certain trail can not be travel that a certain stream can not be
cross and to find that mountain trail and stream can all be pass
with littl seriou difficulti by a man who is will to try most
thing said to be imposs ar so onli in the mind of the man whose
timid or inert keep him from make the attempt the whole stori
of the establish and growth of the unit state forest servic is a
stori of the do of thing which the men who did them were warn in
advanc would be imposs usual the thing which cant be done is
well worth try
perhap i ought to add that i am not urg the young forest to
disregard local public opinion without the best of reason or to rush
hi hors blindli into the ford of a swollen stream good sens is the
first condit of success i am mere sai that in ninetynin case
out of a hundr when a thing ought to be done it can be done if the
effort is made with that idea in mind
all thi is but on wai of sai that the forest should be hi own
severest taskmast the forest must keep himself up to hi own work
in no other profess to my knowledg is a man thrown so complet
on hi own respons the forest often lead an isol life for
week or month at a time see the men under whom he work onli at
distant interv becaus he is so much hi own master the
respons which rest upon him is peculiarli hi own and must be
met out of the resourc within himself
the train of a forest should lead him to be practic in the right
sens of that word which emphat is not the sens of abandon
standard of work or conduct in order to get immedi result the
practic men with whom the forest must do hi worklumbermen
cattlemen sheepmen settler forest user of all kindsar often by
veri much hi superior in usabl knowledg of the detail of their
work their opinion ar entitl to the most complet hear and
respect there is no other class of men from whose advic the forest
can so greatli profit if he choos to do so he is superior to them if
at all onli in hi technic knowledg and in the broader point of
view he ha deriv from hi profession train it is of the first
import that the young forest should know these men should learn
to like and respect them and that he should get all the help he can
from their knowledg and practic experi the willing to us
the inform and assist which such men were readi to give ha
more than onc meant the differ between failur and success
the young forest like other young men is like to be impati i
do not blame him for it rightli direct hi impati mai becom on
of hi best asset but it will do no harm to rememb also that the
human race ha reach it present degre of civil and
advanc onli step by step and that it seem like to proce in
veri much the same wai hereaft as a gener rule result slowli and
painfulli accomplish ar last the result to be achiev in
forestri must be last if thei ar to be valuabl
in gener the men with whom the forest deal can adopt and in mani
case ought to adopt a new point of view but slowli to fall in love
at first sight with theori or polici is as rare as the same
experi is between person as a rule an intellectu convict
howev well found must be follow by a period of incub and
growth befor it can blossom into a definit principl of action befor
the man who hold it is readi to work or fight in order to carri it out
there is a rate in the adopt of new idea beyond which onli the most
unusu circumst will induc men mind to move forestri ha gone
ahead in the unit state faster than it ever did in ani other land if
it proce a littl less rapidli now that so much of the field ha
been won there will be no reason for discourag in that
as a subordin offic
necessarili the young forest will begin as a subordin how soon he
will come to give order of hi own will depend on how well he execut
the order of hi superior in particular it will depend on whether he
requir to be coddl in do hi work or whether he is will and
abl to stand on hi own feet the man for whom everi employ of men is
search everywher and alwai is the man who will accept the
respons for the work he ha to dowho will not lean at everi
point upon hi superior for addit instruct advic or
encourag
there is no more valuabl subordin than the man to whom you can give
a piec of work and then forget about it in the confid expect
that the next time it is brought to your attent it will come in the
form of a report that the thing ha been done when thi master qualiti
is join to execut power loyalti and common sens the result is a
man whom you can trust on the other hand there is no greater nuisanc
to a man heavili burden with the direct of affair than the
weakback assist who is continu try to get hi chief to do
hi work for him on the feebl plea that he thought the chief would
like to decid thi or that himself the man to whom an execut is
most grate the man whom he will work hardest and valu most is the
man who accept respons willingli and is not continu under
hi feet
as a superior offic
the principl of effect administr work have never so far as i
know been adequ classifi and defin when thei come to be
state on of the most import will be found to be the exact
assign of respons so that whatev goe wrong the
administr head will know clearli and at onc upon whom the
respons fall thi is on of the reason why as a rule board
and commiss ar far less effect in get thing done than
singl men with clearcut author and equal clearcut
respons anoth principl so well known that it ha almost
becom a proverb is to deleg everyth you can to do noth that
you can get someon els to do for you but the wisdom of let a good
man alon is less commonli understood it is sometim as import for
the superior offic not to worri hi subordin with useless order as
it is for the subordin not to harass hi superior with useless
question
let a good man alon give him hi head noth will hold him so
rigidli to hi work as the feel that he is trust lead your men in
their work and abov all make of your organ not a monarchi
limit or unlimit but a democraci in which the respons of
each man for a particular piec of work shall not onli be defin but
recogn in which the credit for each man work so far as possibl
shall be attach to hi own name in which the opinion and advic of
your subordin ar often sought befor decis ar made in a word
a democraci in which each man feel a person respons for the
success of the whole enterpris
the young forest mai be year remov from the chanc to appli these
principl in practic but sinc no superior offic can put them into
fruit effect without the coper of hi subordin it is well
that thei should be known at both end of the line
a public servant
i repeat that whether a forest is engag in privat work or in public
work whether he is emploi by a lumberman an associ of
lumbermen a fish and shoot club the owner of a great estat or
whether he is an offic of a state or of the nation by virtu of hi
profess he is a public servant becaus he deal with the forest he
ha hi hand upon the futur welfar of hi countri hi point of view
is that which must control it futur welfar he repres the plan
and orderli develop of it resourc he is the repres also
of the forest school from which he graduat and of hi profess
upon the standard which he help to establish and maintain the welfar
of these too directli depend
state forest work
the work of the state in forestri is still in the pioneer stage and
the work of a state forest must still bear larg on the creation of
a right public sentiment in forest matter in state forestri the need

forest to prepar or endeavor to secur the passag of good state
forest law or to interpos against the enact of bad law in

distribut the identif of tree speci and other forest
botan work is also under the immedi supervis of the forest
and the chief lumberman report directli to him
in addit to the work which fall immedi under the ey of the
forest and which us to but doe not now includ the legal work
necessari to support and promot the oper of the servic there
ar seven princip part or branch in the work of the washington
headquart the first of these is the branch of account whose work i
need not describ further than to sai that the servic ha alwai ow a
veri larg part of it safeti against the bitter attack of it enemi
to the accuraci complet and gener high qualiti of it
account system
the second branch that of oper ha charg of the busi
administr both of the nation forest and of the other work of
the forest servic here the busi method which ar necessari to
keep the organ at a high state of effici ar formul put
in practic and constantli revis for it is onli by such revis
that thei can be kept as thei ar kept at a level with the veri best
practic of the best modern busi there ar veri few govern
bureau of which thi can be said the branch of oper is
respons for the adopt and enforc of laborsav devic in
correspond in handl requisit and in the file and care of
paper gener and for the suppli of stationeri tool and
instrument and the rent of quartersin a word for the whole of
the more or less routin transact of busi which is essenti to
keep so larg an organ at the highest point of effici
illustr brush pile in a nation forest timber sale
the offic work need in the map of the nation forest with
all their resourc boundari and interior hold is in charg of
the branch of oper so is the immens amount of draft which is
necessari in the other work of the servic and the photograph
laboratori in which map ar reproduc and where perman photograph
record of the condit of the forest ar made
the third branch that of silvicultur is the most import of all it
ha oversight of the practic of forestri on all the nation forest
and of all scientif forest studi in the nation forest and
outsid it is here that the condit in the contract under which the
larger timber sale ar made ar final examin and approv and here
ar found the inspector whose duti it is not onli to see that the work
is well done but to labor constantli for improv in method as
well as in result here centr the prepar of forest work
plan and the knowledg of lumber and the lumber market
the branch of silvicultur ha charg also of nation coper for
the advanc of forestri with the sever state and in particular
for fire protect under the week law thi form of coper ha
made the knowledg and equip of the forest servic avail for the
studi of state forest resourc and forest problem and much of the
progress in forestri made by the state is directli due to it
under the branch of silvicultur the offic of forest investig
bring togeth all that is known of the natur and growth of tree in
thi countri and to some extent in other countri also conduct
independ studi of the greatest valu in develop better method
of secur the reproduct of import forest tree and comput
the enorm number of forest measur deal with the stand and
the rate of growth of tree and forest that ar turn in by the
parti engag in forest investig in the field under the offic
of forest investig studi in forest distribut and in the
structur of wood ar carri on and it includ the librari of the
forest servic by far the most complet and effect forest librari in
the unit state
the fourth branch that of graze supervis the us of the nation
forest for pastur over the greater part of the west thi wa the
first us to which the forest were put and an idea of it magnitud
mai be gather from the fact that everi year the nation forest
suppli feed for about a million and a half cattl and hors and more
than fourteen million sheep it is no easi task to permit all thi live
stock to util the forag which the nation forest produc and yet
do littl or no harm to the young growth on which the futur of the
forest depend to exclud the graze anim altogeth is imposs
and undesir for to do so would ruin the lead industri in mani
portion of the west consequ mani of the most difficult and
perplex question in the practic administr of the nation
forest have occur in the work of the branch of graze and have
there been solv and mani of the most bitter attack upon it have
there been met
the fifth branch that of land ha to do with the question which
aris from the us of the land in the nation forest for farm or
ranch mine and a veri wide varieti of other purpos and with
the exceedingli numer and intric question which aris becaus
there ar about 21100000 acr of land within the boundari of the
nation forest whose titl ha alreadi pass from the govern the
boundari of the nation forest also ar constantli be examin to
determin whether thei includ all the land and onli the land to be
contain within them and whether thei should be extend or reduc
the first permit for the us of waterpow site on govern land
were issu by the forest servic and the polici which is just be
adopt by the interior depart and other govern organ in
their handl of waterpow question wa there first develop these
permit ar prepar in the branch of land the first step toward
deter men who attempt in defianc of the law to get possess of
land claim to be agricultur or miner within the nation forest
ar taken here but the final decis on these point rest with the
depart of the interior the examin of land to determin
whether thei ar agricultur in charact and therefor should be
open to settlement is direct from thi branch
the us to which nation forest land ar put ar almost unbeliev
variou barn borrow pit botan garden cemeteri and church
dairi and dip vat fox ranch and fish hatcheri hotel
pastur pipe line power site resid sanitaria and
schoolhous store and tunnel these and mani other make up with
graze and timber sale the us of the nation forest for which
alreadi more than half a million permit have been issu thi work
also fall to the branch of land
the sixth branch that of forest product is concern with the whole
question of the us of wood and other materi produc by the forest
it princip work is conduct through the forest product laboratori
in coper with the univers of wisconsin at madison here timber
is test to ascertain it strength the product of wood distil
ar investig wood pulp and paper studi of larg reach ar carri
on the method of wood preserv and the result of appli them
ar in constant cours of be examin and the diseas of tree and
of wood ar studi in coper with the bureau of plant industri of
the unit state depart of agricultur the consumpt of wood
and the product of lumber and forest product ar also the subject
of continu investig and variou necessari special studi ar
undertaken from time to time at the moment an effort is under wai to
find new us and new market for wood kill by the chestnut blight in
the northeastern unit state
the seventh branch ha to do with the studi select and acquisit
of land under the week law in accord with which eight million
dollar wa appropri for the purchas of forest land valuabl for
stream protect with particular refer to the southern
appalachian and the white mountain of new england the examin of
the amount of merchant timber on land under consider for
purchas the studi of the charact of the land and the forest and the
survei of the land keep a numer bodi of young men veri fulli
occupi their task is to see that none but the right land is
recommend for acquisit by the govern that the natur and valu
of the land select shall be most thoroughli known and that the
constant effort to make the govern pai unreason price or
purchas under unfavor condit shall as constantli be defeat
the same branch take charg of the land as soon as thei have been
acquir
the forego descript of the work which is done in washington by the
forest servic mai help to make clear the great varieti of task to
which a forest mai be requir to set hi hand and emphas the
need of a broad train not strictli confin to pure technic
line it would be defect as a descript howev and would fail
to show the spirit in which the work is done if no mention were made of
the servic meet at which the respons head of each branch and
of the work of the forest offic meet onc a week to discuss everi
problem which confront the servic and everi phase of it work thi
meet is the centr where all part of the work of the servic come
togeth and arrang their mutual coper and it is also the spring
from which the essenti democraci of the organ take it rise
the servic meet is the best thing in the forest servic and that is
sai a great deal
it must not be imagin that the mainten of forest servic
headquart in washington indic that the actual busi of
handl the nation forest is carri on at long rang in order to
avoid ani such possibl the six district offic were organ in
1908 these ar situat at missoula denver albuquerqu portland
ogden and san francisco each of the district offic is in charg of a
district forest who direct the practic carri out of the
polici final determin upon in washington after consult with
the men in the field the execut of all the work the larger featur
of which the washington offic decid and direct and the detail of
which it inspect is the task of the district forest the district
forest offic is necessarili organ much on the same gener
line as the washington headquart thu the subject of account
oper silvicultur graze land and forest product ar all
repres in the district offic in addit a legal offic is

while the work of the washington offic is mainli that of guid the
work of the nation forest along broad gener line through
instruct to the district forest the offic of each district
forest deal directli with the forest supervisor and so with the
handl of the nation forest a multitud of question which the
supervisor can not answer ar decid in the district offic instead
as wa formerli the case of be forward to washington for dispos
there with the consequ aggrav and needless delai the
establish of the district offic ha made the handl of the
nation forest far less complic and far more prompt and ha
brought it far closer than ever befor to the actual usersthat is
ha made it far more quickli and accur respons to their need
privat forestri
as yet the practic of forestri by privat owner except for fire
protect ha made but littl progress in the unit state although
without doubt it will be wide extend dure the next ten or fifteen
year the concentr of timberland ownership in the unit state
ha put a few men in control of vast area of forest mani of them ar
anxiou to prevent forest destruct so far as that mai be practic
without interf with their profit and for that purpos forest
ar begin to be emploi until now the princip task of forest
emploi by lumbermen have been the measur of the amount of lumber
in the stand crop of tree and the protect of forest land from
fire here and there the practic of a certain amount of forestri ha
been ad but thi part of the work of the privat forest emploi
by lumbermen ha not been import it is like howev to increas
with some rapid befor long in the meantim the privat forest
must usual be will to accept a good mani limit on the
technic side of hi work
it is essenti for the forest thu emploi to have or promptli to
acquir a knowledg of practic lumber that is of log
mill and market and for the forest student who expect to enter
thi work to give special attent to these subject
alreadi about 170 graduat of forest school ar in privat emploi a
consider proport of which number ar emploi by larg lumbermen
the time is undoubtedli come and i hope it mai come soon when forest
destruct will be legal recogn as hostil to the public welfar
and when lumbermen will be compel by law to handl their forest so
as to insur the reproduct of them under reason condit and
within a reason time the idea is neither tyrann nor new in
democrat switzerland privat owner of timberland ar restrain by
law from destroi the forest upon which the welfar of that mountain
region so larg depend and if thei disobei their forest land ar
replant by the govern at the owner expens
anoth open for forest in the emploi of lumbermen is through the
forest fire protect associ of these two stand out most
conspicu at the present time on the northwestern conserv and
forestri associ the other the oregon forest fire associ each
ha as it execut offic a train forest whose knowledg of the
wood not onli make him exceedingli us to hi employ but also
when combin with the forest point of view enabl him to be of
great valu in protect the gener interest in the forest
the object and method of on of the associ is describ by it
secretari as follow
a field hitherto narrow but continu broaden and offer much
opportun for those with peculiar qualif is the manag of
the coper forest work carri on by timber owner in mani
local often jointli with state and govern thi movement
origin in the pacif northwest where it still ha the highest
develop but is extend to the lake state new england and
canada
as a rule the primari object of these coper associ is fire
prevent and their local manag must have demonstr abil to
organ effect patrol system build telephon line appli everi
ingenu to suppli and equip their forc and abov all to
handl men in emerg but in most case the associ of forest
owner to thi end ha led also to progress in mani other matter
insepar from improv such as studi of reforest
possibl forest legisl educ lumberman and public in
forest preserv and the extens of coper in all these as
well as in fire prevent from privat to state and feder agenc
the develop of such activ is alreadi emploi sever highli
paid men who can command the confid not onli of forest owner but
also of the public and of public offici advis in legisl as
well as technic forestri matter and particularli profici in all
that pertain to forest protect their us li as much
outsid their own associ as within them and to be success thei
must be skil organ and campaign it is these men who have
develop to it highest extent the adapt to forestri propaganda of
modern public and advertis method
as a rule howev these mai be describ as graduat posit
fill by men of experi and acquaint with the sever agenc
involv rather than by newli fledg forest a practic knowledg
of protect problem is essenti
forestri associ offer a differ but often a most fascin
field of work for the train forest there ar at present 39 such
associ the work which thei offer ha much in common with the
duti of a state forest
fish and game associ ar begin to emploi forest realiz
that the wise handl of the forest mai well go hand in hand with the
care of the game and fish which the forest shelter and protect
eventu nearli all such associ which control ani consider
bodi of land in timber region mai be expect to util the servic
of train forest of their own
in addit to the work for lumbermen and for associ of variou
kind land owner in consider varieti have begun to emploi
forest among these ar coal and coke compani iron compani wood
pulp and paper compani which ar begin to look after their suppli
of timber powder arm and ammunit compani hydraul and water

forest school
sinc the first on wa found in 1898 the number of forest school in
the unit state ha increas so rapidli as to creat a demand for
forest instructor which it ha been exceedingli difficult to fill
inde the increas in secondari forest school or school not of the
first grade ha doubtless been more rapid than the welfar of the
profess or the sound practic of forestri requir and the brisk
demand for teacher ha led some men to take up the task of instruct
who were not well fit for it
there ar in thi countri todai 23 forest school which prepar men for
the practic of forestri as a profess and 51 school which devot
themselv to gener instruct in forestri or to cours for forest
ranger and forest guard the approxim number of teacher in all
forest school is at present 110 and thi number will doubtless be
still further increas by the addit of new forest school or the
expans of old on while a certain number of place will be made
vacant by the retir of men who find themselv better fit for
other line of work
the teach staff at three of the princip forest school of the
countri is as follow
at school a 5 men give their whole time to forest instruct and 14
give cours in the forest school
school b and c have each 4 men who give their whole time to the work
and 4 and 20 respect who give lectur or individu cours
in addit to the work for lumbermen associ railroad and
other just mention an increas number of forest ar requir to
care for the forest on larg land estat in differ part of the
countri work of thi kind is at present restrict almost entir to
the east and especi to new england where sever firm of
consult forest give to it the larger portion of their time some
of the men thu emploi ar as fulli occupi with the task of the
profession forest as ani of the men in the govern servic while
other give a part of their attent to the gener manag of the
properti or to the protect and propag of game and fish
the opportun
govern servic
there is no more us profess than forestri the opportun to
make himself count in affair of public import come earlier and
more certainli to the forest than to the member of ani other
profess the first and most valuabl therefor of the incent
which lead the forest to hi choic is the chanc to make himself of
us to hi countri and to hi gener
but if thi is the first matter to be consid in decid upon a
profess it is by no mean the last and the practic consider
of a fair return for good work bread and butter for a man and hi
famili the certainti or uncertainti of employmentsuch question as
these must have their full share of attent
there ar in the unit state forest servic 1059 forest guard 1247
forest ranger 233 supervisor and deputi supervisor and 115 forest
assist and 177 forest examin who as alreadi explain ar the
technic men in charg of practic forestri on the nation forest
the six district offic togeth includ in their membership about 50
profession forest and about 65 more ar attach to the
headquart at washington so that allow for duplic there ar
about 335 train forest in the unit state forest servic
the number of new appoint to the forest servic in the differ
perman grade vari from year to year but mai be said to be

the pai of the state forest or other train forest in charg of

assist from 1000 to 2500 out of the total number onli 2 ar
directli in charg of their own work respons onli to the governor
and the legislatur while 19 act as subordin for state forest
commiss or commission who in the major of case ar polit
appointe in strike contrast with the unit state forest servic
polit ha so far been a danger if not a domin influenc in
the forest work of most of the state which have undertaken it
like the nation forest the state forest alreadi in exist will
creat an increas demand for the servic of technic forest
inde as similar forest ar acquir by most of the state which ar
now without them as undoubtedli thei will be the extent of the
opportun for profession train forest in state work is
certain to grow
privat work
at present the demand for forest in privat work is far less
press and the open is far less attract than it will be in the
not distant futur the number of men that will be requir for thi
work will depend on the develop of legisl as well as upon the
desir of the privat owner lumbermen and other to protect and
improv their properti the time is come and come befor long when
all privat owner of forest in the mountain or on steep slope
elsewher will be requir by law to provid for their protect and
reproduct when that time arriv the demand for forest in
privat work will increas to veri larg dimens and will probabl
do so far more rapidli than forest can be train to suppli it
the pai of forest in privat work whether in the emploi of
lumbermen railroad shoot and fish club the proprietor of
larg privat estat or other forest owner ha so far been somewhat
better than that for similar servic in govern emploi thi monei
differ in favor of privat employ is in my judgment like to
continu and eventu the pai of consult forest of establish
reput emploi in pass upon the valu of forest offer as
secur for invest or in estim the stand timber for
purchas or seller or in other profession work of larg busi
import will certainli reach veri satisfactori figur
teach
approxim 110 forest ar engag in teach in the unit state
todai their pai vari from about 1000 to about 3000 and is like
to increas rather more rapidli than that of other profession
teacher sinc less of them ar avail it is not like howev
that the number of open in teach forestri will be larg within
the next ten year
train
the length of time which hi train is to take and the particular
cours of instruct which he shall pursu ar to the young man
contempl the studi of forestri matter of the first import the
first thing to insist on in that connect is that the train must be
thorough it is natur that a young man should be eager to begin hi
life work and therefor somewhat impati of the long grind of a
thorough school but howev natur it is not the part of wisdom to
cut short the time of prepar when the seriou work of the train
forest begin later on there will be littl or no time to fill the
gap left at school and the earnest desir of the young forest will
be that he had spent more time in hi prepar rather than less in
thi matter i speak as on who ha gather a convict from person
experi and believ he know
it would be useless to attempt to strike an averag of the work
prescrib and the cours given at the variou forest school i shall
describ therefor not an averag system of instruct but on which
in the judgment of men entitl to an opinion and in my own judgment
is sound practic and effect
forest school mai roughli be divid between those which do not prepar
men for profession work in forestri and those which do the latter
mai be divid again into undergradu school and graduat school
most of the former offer a fouryear undergradu cours and their
student receiv their degre at the same time as other member of the
univers who enter at the same time with them the graduat school
requir a colleg degre or it equival in certain subject befor
thei will receiv a student the men who have complet their cours
have usual therefor pursu more extens and more advanc
studi in forestri ar better train and ar themselv older and
more readi to accept the respons which forestri bring upon
them for these reason the graduat school train is by far the more
desir in my opinion
the subject requir for entranc to a graduat forest school should
includ at least on full year in colleg botani cover the gener
morpholog histolog and physiolog of plant on cours each in
geologi physic inorgan chemistri zologi and econom with
mathemat through trigonometri and a read knowledg of french or
german some acquaint with mechan draw is also desir but
not absolut necessari other cours which ar extrem desir
if not altogeth essenti ar mineralog meteorolog mechan
physic geographi organ chemistri and possibl calculu which mai
be of us in timber physic
on or two forest school begin their cours of train for the first
year in juli instead of in octob in order to give their student some
acquaint with the wood from the forest standpoint befor the
more formal cours begin the result of thi plan is to give increas
vivid and realiti to all the cours which follow the work in the
wood to make clear the applic of what is taught and so to add
greatli to the effici of the teach
in addit to thi preliminari touch with the wood ani wise plan of
teach will includ mani forest excurs and much practic field
work as vital import part of the instruct thi outdoor work
should occur throughout the whole cours winter and summer and in
addit the last term of the senior year mai well be spent wholli in
the wood where the student can be train in the manag of
log oper and mill and can get their final practic work in
survei and mapmak in prepar forest work plan estim
timber lai out road and trail make plan for lumber oper
and other similar practic work sever of the best forest school
have adopt thi plan
the regular cours of a graduat forest school usual cover a period
of two year thei should fit a student for nearli everi phase of
profession work in forestri and should give him a sound prepar
not mere for practic work in the wood but also for the broader
work of forest organ in the govern servic in the unit
state and in the philippin and in the servic of the state for
handl larg tract of privat forest land for expert work in the
emploi of lumbermen and other forest owner for public speak and
write for teach and for scientif research
everi well equip forest school will have a work librari of book
pamphlet and lumber journal publish here and abroad an herbarium
at least of nativ tree and shrub and of the more import forest
herb togeth with a collect of forest tree fruit and seed and
specimen of domest and foreign timber exhibit show the us of
wood and the variou form of tool us in lumber as well as the
apparatu for laboratori work and survei and forest instrument for
work in the field ar often of great valu to the student
what should a young man learn at a forest school doubtless there will
be some variat of opinion as to the exact cours of studi which will
best fit him for the work of a forest in the unit state the
follow list express the best judgment on the subject i have been
abl to form
dendrolog
the first step in forestri is to becom acquaint with the variou
kind of tree the come forest must learn to identifi the woodi
plant of the unit state both in summer and in winter he must
understand their shape and outward structur and where thei ar
found and he must begin hi knowledg of the individu habit of
growth and life which distinguish the tree which ar import in
forestri
forest physiographi
tree grow in the soil it is import to know someth of the origin
of soil and their properti and valu and of the princip soil
type with special refer to their effect upon plant distribut
and welfar the origin natur valu and conserv of humu that
most essenti ingredi of the forest floor the field method of
map soil type the rock type most import in their relat to
soil how thei ar made up how thei make soil and where thei
occursometh should be learn of all thi final under thi
head the student ought to get a usabl knowledg of the physiograph
region of the unit state their boundari geolog structur
topographi drainag and soilsal thi natur with special
refer to the relat between these basic fact and the forest
silvicultur
silvicultur is the art of care for forest and therefor the
backbon of forestri it is base upon silvic which is the knowledg
of the habit or behavior of tree in their relat to light heat
and moistur to the air and soil and to each other it is the fact
embrac in silvic which explain the composit charact and form
of the forest the success or failur of tree speci in competit
with each other the distribut of tree and of forest the
develop of each tree in height diamet and volum it form and
length of life the method of it reproduct and the effect of all
these upon the natur and the evolut of the citi of tree and upon
forest type and their life histori
thi is knowledg the forest can not do without silvic is the
foundat of hi profession capac and as a student he can better
afford to scamp ani part of hi train rather than thi a man mai be
a poor forest who know silvic but no man can be a good forest who
doe not
the practic of silvicultur ha to do with the treatment of woodland
the forest student must learn the differ method of reproduc
forest by differ method of cut them down and the applic
of these method in differ american forest region there ar also
mani method of cut for the improv of the charact and growth
of forest as well as for util materi that otherwis would go to
wast befor the final reproduct cut can be made the wai in
which forest need protect ar equal numer and of these by far
the most import in our countri have to do with method of prevent
or extinguish forest fire
well manag forest ar handl under work plan base on the
silvic charact and silvicultur need of the forest as well as
upon the purpos set by the owner as the object of manag which is
often close relat to question of forest financ the student should
ground himself thoroughli in the make of silvicultur work plan
and the more practic in make them he can get the better so too
with the mark of tree in reproduct and improv cut under
as mani differ kind of forest condit as mai be possibl
the artifici reproduct of forest is like to occupi far more of
the forest attent in the futur than it ha in the past henc
the collect of tree seed their fertil and vital as affect
their handl the best method of seed and plant and the
lesson of past failur and success with the whole subject of
nurseri work and the care of young plantat must by no mean be
overlook
much incident inform on the subject of forest protect will
come to the student in the cours of hi studi but special attent
should be given to learn which of the speci of forest insect ar
most injuri to forest veget how their attack ar made how
thei mai be discov and the best wai by which such attack can be
mitig or control so also the diseas of timber tree will repai
hard studi the princip fungi which caus such diseas should be
known how thei attack the tree and what ar the remedi as well as
although thi is far less import the wai to treat tree wound and
the correct method of prune
forest econom
forest econom is a larg subject it deal with the product valu
of forest to their owner and with the larger question of their place
in the economi of the nation it consid their us as conserv of
the soil and the stream their effect on climat local as in the
case of windbreak and on a larger scale and their contribut to
the public welfar as recreat ground and game refug it includ a
knowledg of wast from which the forest suffer and the consequ
loss to industri and to the public and in thi it doe not omit the
effect of forest fire statist of forest consumpt the relat
of the forest to railroad mine and other woodus industri it
effect upon agricultur stock rais and manufactur industri
and it effect upon the us of the stream for navig power
irrig and domest water suppli all these ar import the
student should consid also the forest resourc of the unit state
their present condit and the need thei must be fit to suppli
forest engin
forest engin is steadili becom more and more necessari to the
forest he must have a work knowledg of the us of survei
instrument the make of topograph survei the offic work requir
of an engin the make of topograph map the locat of trail
road and railroad and the construct of bridg telephon line

the practic of forestri
the practic of forestri is necessarili differ in differ kind of

know must here be appli and appli in workabl fashion not onli to
the forest but to the men who us the forest thi is peculiarli true
of the practic of forestri in nation and state forest everywher
forest product
under thi gener subject the forest student must acquaint himself
through the microscop with the minut anatomi of the woodi stem of
conifer and broadleaf tree and the occurr form structur and
variabl of the element which make it up he should becom familiar
with the method of classifi the econom wood of the unit state
both under the microscop and with the unassist ey and for thi
purpos should know someth of their color gloss grain densiti
odor and reson both as aid to identif and as to their

method of us these properti in the make of charcoal and wood
pulp in wood distil the turpentin industri in tan and
dye and in other industri
a field of great import is the relat between the physic
structur and the mechan properti of wood a student should inform
himself concern the standard method of test the properti of
structur timber by bend compress shear torsion impact
and the hard and tension test with their relat to heat and
moistur and the method of season the us of preserv and
the effect of the rate of applic of the load

lumber
lumber the forest should know more than a littl about as how to
organ lumber oper the equip and manag of log and
mill in variou forest region the manufactur season and
grade of the rough and finish lumber cost keep in a lumber
busi method of sale market requir at home and abroad
price the relat of the lumber tariff to forestri lumber
associ timber bond and insur the practic construct of
log equip such as aerial tramwai log slide dam and
flume is of peculiar import and so ar the condit and chang
of the lumber market
experi on the land of some oper lumber compani is of great
valu it should includ a studi of log method log scale wast
in log the equip and handl of the mill the saw and care
of rough and finish lumber it grade and so far as possibl an
acquaint with wood work plant of variou kind and with the
oper of turpentin orchard studi along these line mai with
advantag be almost indefinit extend to includ for exampl the
util of steam machineri for log the improv of stream
for drive log and other similar question
forest law
the forest must have at least a slight acquaint with forest law
both state and nation it is import to know someth of the
gener principl of classifi the public land of state law for
fire protect the develop of forest polici in the variou
state as legal express and the import law which govern the
creation and manag of state forest reserv
forest taxat state and local which ha when excess so much to
do with hasten forest destruct is on of the most import
question which can engag the attent of the forest
under the subject of feder forest law it is not suffici for the
student to acquaint himself with those law alon which govern the
forest he must also have some knowledg of the creation of a forest
polici out of the public land polici of the unit state some
acquaint with the public land law a good work knowledg of the
law and regul govern the nation forest is indispens
and the student should at least know where to find the more import
court decis by which thei ar interpret
forest histori
the histori of forestri in europ ha a certain import in throw
light on our own forest histori and it probabl develop and thi
is especi true of the histori of the administr of govern
forest land and of educ in forestri
the histori of forestri in the unit state howev is far more
import the forest must know the stori of the growth and chang of
nation forest organ the forest offic and their duti the
cost size and effect of the govern forest servic at
differ time the civil servic regul under which it is
recruit and other similar matter it is import likewis for him
to becom thoroughli satur with an intim knowledg of the
develop of forestri in public opinion in the unit state it
extens to the other natur resourc through the conserv
polici and the relat of the forest point of view thu express
to the present welfar and futur success of the nation
it is not alwai possibl for the forest student to becom a woodsman
befor enter hi profess but it is most desir a forest
must be abl to travel the forest alon by dai and by night he should
be a good fisherman and a good hunter which is far more import than
to be a good shot and deepli interest in both fish and game the
better horseman he is the better forest he will be and especi if
he can pack and handl pack hors in the wood so that whether the
young forest begin with a practic knowledg of woodcraft or not he
must not fail to acquir or improv it for without it he will endang
the whole success of hi career
some knowledg of first aid to the injur is like to be of great and
sudden valu to a man so much of whose life must be spent in the wood
at a distanc from medic aid the time spent in get inform on
thi subject will be anyth but wast
english
the abil to write and to speak good plain understand english is
a prime requisit in the forest train it is a part of educ
frequent neglect especi by those in engin or scientif
pursuit yet it import for the forest is veri larg as alreadi
point out the forest is on the fire line of the conserv
movement he is pioneer in a new profess for thi reason he will
often need to explain hi stand and convert other to hi belief in
addit he must make avail to other the result he secur from
the studi of new fact a usabl command of hi own languag will stand
him in good stead whether he need to talk face to face with anoth
man or from a platform to a concours of peopl or to put into
readabl print form the result of hi observ or hi think
when the young forest ha complet the cours of hi school train
in america the question mai be rais whether he should supplement hi
train by studi abroad i am strongli of opinion that he should do so
if he can studi abroad is not indispens for the american forest
but it can do him noth but good to see in practic oper the
method of forestri which have result from the long experi of
other land and especi to becom familiar with the effect of sound
forestri on the forest
