my uncl make a great discoveri
look back to all that ha occur to me sinc that event dai i
am scarc abl to believ in the realiti of my adventur thei were
truli so wonder that even now i am bewild when i think of them
my uncl wa a german have marri my mother sister an
englishwoman be veri much attach to hi fatherless nephew he
invit me to studi under him in hi home in the fatherland thi home
wa in a larg town and my uncl a professor of philosophi chemistri
geologi mineralog and mani other ologi
on dai after pass some hour in the laboratorymi uncl be
absent at the timei suddenli felt the necess of renov the
tissuesiiei i wa hungri and wa about to rous up our old french
cook when my uncl professor von hardwigg suddenli open the street
door and came rush upstair
now professor hardwigg my worthi uncl is by no mean a bad sort of
man he is howev choler and origin to bear with him mean to
obei and scarc had hi heavi feet resound within our joint
domicil than he shout for me to attend upon him
harryharryharri
i hasten to obei but befor i could reach hi room jump three
step at a time he wa stamp hi right foot upon the land
harri he cri in a frantic tone ar you come up
now to tell the truth at that moment i wa far more interest in the
question as to what wa to constitut our dinner than in ani problem of
scienc to me soup wa more interest than soda an omelett more
tempt than arithmet and an artichok of ten time more valu than
ani amount of asbesto
but my uncl wa not a man to be kept wait so adjourn therefor
all minor question i present myself befor him
he wa a veri learn man now most person in thi categori suppli
themselv with inform as peddler do with good for the benefit
of other and lai up store in order to diffus them abroad for the
benefit of societi in gener not so my excel uncl professor
hardwigg he studi he consum the midnight oil he pore over heavi
tome and digest huge quarto and folio in order to keep the
knowledg acquir to himself
there wa a reason and it mai be regard as a good on why my uncl
object to displai hi learn more than wa absolut necessari he
stammer and when intent upon explain the phenomena of the heaven
wa apt to find himself at fault and allud in such a vagu wai to sun
moon and star that few were abl to comprehend hi mean to tell
the honest truth when the right word would not come it wa gener
replac by a veri power adject
in connect with the scienc there ar mani almost unpronounc
namesnam veri much resembl those of welsh villag and my uncl
be veri fond of us them hi habit of stammer wa not therebi
improv in fact there were period in hi discours when he would
final give up and swallow hi discomfiturein a glass of water
as i said my uncl professor hardwigg wa a veri learn man and i
now add a most kind rel i wa bound to him by the doubl ti of
affect and interest i took deep interest in all hi do and
hope some dai to be almost as learn myself it wa a rare thing for
me to be absent from hi lectur like him i prefer mineralog to
all the other scienc my anxieti wa to gain real iknowledg of the
earthi geologi and mineralog were to us the sole object of life and
in connect with these studi mani a fair specimen of stone chalk
or metal did we break with our hammer
steel rod loadston glass pipe and bottl of variou acid were
often befor us than our meal my uncl hardwigg wa onc known to
classifi six hundr differ geolog specimen by their weight
hard fusibl sound tast and smell
he correspond with all the great learn and scientif men of the
ag i wa therefor in constant commun with at all event the
letter of sir humphri davi captain franklin and other great men
but befor i state the subject on which my uncl wish to confer with
me i must sai a word about hi person appear ala my reader
will see a veri differ portrait of him at a futur time after he ha
gone through the fear adventur yet to be relat
my uncl wa fifti year old tall thin and wiri larg spectacl
hid to a certain extent hi vast round and goggl ey while hi
nose wa irrever compar to a thin file so much inde did it
resembl that us articl that a compass wa said in hi presenc to
have made consider n nasal deviat
the truth be told howev the onli articl realli attract to my
uncl nose wa tobacco
anoth peculiar of hi wa that he alwai step a yard at a time
clench hi fist as if he were go to hit you and wa when in on
of hi peculiar humor veri far from a pleasant companion
it is further necessari to observ that he live in a veri nice hous
in that veri nice street the konigstrass at hamburg though ly in
the centr of a town it wa perfectli rural in it aspecthalf wood
half brick with oldfashion gableson of the few old hous spare
by the great fire of 1842
when i sai a nice hous i mean a handsom houseold totter and
not exactli comfort to english notion a hous a littl off the
perpendicular and inclin to fall into the neighbor canal exactli
the hous for a wander artist to depict all the more that you could
scarc see it for ivi and a magnific old tree which grew over the
door
my uncl wa rich hi hous wa hi own properti while he had a
consider privat incom to my notion the best part of hi
possess wa hi goddaught gretchen and the old cook the young
ladi the professor and i were the sole inhabit
i love mineralog i love geologi to me there wa noth like
pebblesand if my uncl had been in a littl less of a furi we should
have been the happiest of famili to prove the excel hardwigg
impati i solemnli declar that when the flower in the drawingroom
pot began to grow he rose everi morn at four oclock to make them
grow quicker by pull the leav
have describ my uncl i will now give an account of our interview
he receiv me in hi studi a perfect museum contain everi natur
curios that can well be imaginedminer howev predomin
everi on wa familiar to me have been catalogu by my own hand my
uncl appar oblivi of the fact that he had summon me to hi
presenc wa absorb in a book he wa particularli fond of earli
edit tall copi and uniqu work
wonder he cri tap hi forehead wonderfulwond
it wa on of those yellowleav volum now rare found on stall
and to me it appear to possess but littl valu my uncl howev
wa in raptur
he admir it bind the clear of it charact the eas with
which it open in hi hand and repeat aloud half a dozen time
that it wa veri veri old
to my fanci he wa make a great fuss about noth but it wa not my
provinc to sai so on the contrari i profess consider interest
in the subject and ask him what it wa about
it is the heimskringla of snorr tarleson he said the celebr
iceland author of the twelfth centuryit is a true and correct
account of the norwegian princ who reign in iceland
my next question relat to the languag in which it wa written i
hope at all event it wa translat into german my uncl wa
indign at the veri thought and declar he wouldnt give a penni for
a translat hi delight wa to have found the origin work in the
iceland tongu which he declar to be on of the most magnific
and yet simpl idiom in the worldwhil at the same time it
grammat combin were the most vari known to student
about as easi as german wa my insidi remark
my uncl shrug hi shoulder
the letter at all event i said ar rather difficult of
comprehens
it is a runic manuscript the languag of the origin popul of
iceland invent by odin himself cri my uncl angri at my
ignor
i wa about to ventur upon some misplac joke on the subject when a
small scrap of parchment fell out of the leav like a hungri man
snatch at a morsel of bread the professor seiz it it wa about
five inch by three and wa scrawl over in the most extraordinari
fashion
the line shown here ar an exact facsimil of what wa written on the
vener piec of parchmentand have wonder import as thei
induc my uncl to undertak the most wonder seri of adventur
which ever fell to the lot of human be
my uncl look keenli at the document for some moment and then
declar that it wa runic the letter were similar to those in the
book but then what did thei mean thi wa exactli what i want to
know
now as i had a strong convict that the runic alphabet and dialect
were simpli an invent to mystifi poor human natur i wa delight
to find that my uncl knew as much about the matter as i didwhich wa
noth at all event the tremul motion of hi finger made me think
so
and yet he mutter to himself it is old iceland i am sure of
it
and my uncl ought to have known for he wa a perfect polyglot
dictionari in himself he did not pretend like a certain learn
pundit to speak the two thousand languag and four thousand idiom
made us of in differ part of the globe but he did know all the
more import on
it is a matter of great doubt to me now to what violent measur my
uncl impetuos might have led him had not the clock struck two
and our old french cook call out to let us know that dinner wa on the
tabl
bother the dinner cri my uncl
but as i wa hungri i salli forth to the dine room where i took up
my usual quarter out of polit i wait three minut but no sign
of my uncl the professor i wa surpris he wa not usual so blind
to the pleasur of a good dinner it wa the acm of german
luxuryparslei soup a ham omelett with sorrel trim an oyster of
veal stew with prune delici fruit and sparkl mosel for the
sake of pore over thi musti old piec of parchment my uncl forbor
to share our meal to satisfi my conscienc i at for both
the old cook and housekeep wa nearli out of her mind after take so
much troubl to find her master not appear at dinner wa to her a sad
disappointmentwhich as she occasion watch the havoc i wa
make on the viand becam also alarm if my uncl were to come to
tabl after all
suddenli just as i had consum the last appl and drunk the last glass
of wine a terribl voic wa heard at no great distanc it wa my
uncl roar for me to come to him i made veri nearli on leap of
itso loud so fierc wa hi tone
chapter 2
the mysteri parchment
illustr runic glyph
i declar cri my uncl strike the tabl fierc with hi fist
i declar to you it is runicand contain some wonder secret which
i must get at at ani price
i wa about to repli when he stop me
sit down he said quit fierc and write to my dictat
i obei
i will substitut he said a letter of our alphabet for that of the
runic we will then see what that will produc now begin and make no
mistak
the dictat commenc with the follow incomprehens result

scarc give me time to finish my uncl snatch the document from
my hand and examin it with the most rapt and deep attent
i should like to know what it mean he said after a long period
i certainli could not tell him nor did he expect me tohi
convers be uniformli answer by himself
i declar it put me in mind of a cryptograph he cri unless
inde the letter have been written without ani real mean and yet
why take so much troubl who know but i mai be on the verg of some
great discoveri
my candid opinion wa that it wa all rubbish but thi opinion i kept
carefulli to myself as my uncl choler wa not pleasant to bear all
thi time he wa compar the book with the parchment
the manuscript volum and the smaller document ar written in differ
hand he said the cryptograph is of much later date than the book
there is an undoubt proof of the correct of my surmis an
irrefrag proof i took it to be the first letter is a doubl m
which wa onli ad to the iceland languag in the twelfth
centurythi make the parchment two hundr year posterior to the
volum
the circumst appear veri probabl and veri logic but it wa
all surmis to me
to me it appear probabl that thi sentenc wa written by some owner
of the book now who wa the owner is the next import question
perhap by great good luck it mai be written somewher in the volum
with these word professor hardwigg took off hi spectacl and take
a power magnifi glass examin the book carefulli
on the fly leaf wa what appear to be a blot of ink but on
examin prove to be a line of write almost effac by time thi
wa what he sought and after some consider time he made out these
letter
illustr runic glyph
arn saknussemm he cri in a joyou and triumphant tone that is
not onli an iceland name but of a learn professor of the sixteenth
centuri a celebr alchemist
i bow as a sign of respect
these alchemist he continu avicenna bacon lulli paracelsu
were the true the onli learn men of the dai thei made surpris
discoveri mai not thi saknussemm nephew mine have hidden on thi
bit of parchment some astound invent i believ the cryptograph to
have a profound meaningwhich i must make out
my uncl walk about the room in a state of excit almost
imposs to describ
it mai be so sir i timidli observ but why conceal it from
poster if it be a us a worthi discoveri
whyhow should i know did not galileo make a secret of hi
discoveri in connect with saturn but we shall see until i
discov the mean of thi sentenc i will neither eat nor sleep
my dear uncl i began
nor you neither he ad
it wa lucki i had taken doubl allow that dai
in the first place he continu there must be a clue to the
mean if we could find that the rest would be easi enough
i began serious to reflect the prospect of go without food and
sleep wa not a promis on so i determin to do my best to solv
the mysteri my uncl meanwhil went on with hi soliloqui
the wai to discov it is easi enough in thi document there ar on
hundr and thirtytwo letter give seventynin conson to
fiftythre vowel thi is about the proport found in most southern
languag the idiom of the north be much more rich in conson
we mai confid predict therefor that we have to deal with a
southern dialect
noth could be more logic
now said professor hardwigg to trace the particular languag
as shakespear sai that is the question wa my rather satir
repli
thi man saknussemm he continu wa a veri learn man now as he
did not write in the languag of hi birthplac he probabl like most
learn men of the sixteenth centuri wrote in latin if howev i
prove wrong in thi guess we must try spanish french italian greek
and even hebrew my own opinion though is decidedli in favor of
latin
thi proposit startl me latin wa my favorit studi and it seem
sacrileg to believ thi gibberish to belong to the countri of virgil
barbar latin in all probabl continu my uncl but still
latin
veri probabl i repli not to contradict him
let us see into the matter continu my uncl here you see we have
a seri of on hundr and thirtytwo letter appar thrown
pellmel upon paper without method or organ there ar word
which ar compos wholli of conson such as immrnllsi other
which ar nearli all vowel the fifth for instanc which is unteief
and on of the last oseibo thi appear an extraordinari combin
probabl we shall find that the phrase is arrang accord to some
mathemat plan no doubt a certain sentenc ha been written out and
then jumbl upsom plan to which some figur is the clue now harri
to show your english witwhat is that figur
i could give him no hint my thought were inde far awai while he wa
speak i had caught sight of the portrait of my cousin gretchen and
wa wonder when she would return
we were affianc and love on anoth veri sincer but my uncl
who never thought even of such sublunari matter knew noth of thi
without notic my abstract the professor began read the
puzzl cryptograph all sort of wai accord to some theori of hi
own present rous my wander attent he dictat on preciou
attempt to me
i mildli hand it over to him it read as follow
immessunkasenraicefdoksegnittamurtn

i could scarc keep from laugh while my uncl on the contrari
got in a tower passion struck the tabl with hi fist dart out of
the room out of the hous and then take to hi heel wa present
lost to sight
chapter 3
an astound discoveri
what is the matter cri the cook enter the room when will
master have hi dinner
never
and hi supper
i dont know he sai he will eat no more neither shall i my uncl
ha determin to fast and make me fast until he make out thi
abomin inscript i repli
you will be starv to death she said
i wa veri much of the same opinion but not like to sai so sent her
awai and began some of my usual work of classif but try as i
might noth could keep me from think altern of the stupid
manuscript and of the pretti gretchen
sever time i thought of go out but my uncl would have been angri
at my absenc at the end of an hour my allot task wa done how to
pass the time i began by light my pipe like all other student i
delight in tobacco and seat myself in the great armchair i began
to think
where wa my uncl i could easili imagin him tear along some
solitari road gesticul talk to himself cut the air with
hi cane and still think of the absurd bit of hieroglyph would
he hit upon some clue would he come home in better humor while these
thought were pass through my brain i mechan took up the
execr puzzl and tri everi imagin wai of group the letter
i put them togeth by two by three four and fivesin vain
noth intellig came out except that the fourteenth fifteenth
and sixteenth made iicei in english the eightyfourth eightyfifth
and eightysixth the word isiri then at last i seem to find the
latin word irota mutabil ira nec atrai
ha there seem to be some truth in my uncl notion thought i
then again i seem to find the word ilucoi which mean sacr wood
then in the third line i appear to make out ilabiledi a perfect
hebrew word and at the last the syllabl mere ar mer which were
french
it wa enough to drive on mad four differ idiom in thi absurd
phrase what connect could there be between ic sir anger cruel
sacr wood chang mother ar and sea the first and the last
might in a sentenc connect with iceland mean sea of ic but what
of the rest of thi monstrou cryptograph
i wa in fact fight against an insurmount difficulti my brain
wa almost on fire my ey were strain with stare at the parchment
the whole absurd collect of letter appear to danc befor my
vision in a number of black littl group my mind wa possess with
temporari hallucinationi wa stifl i want air mechan i
fan myself with the document of which now i saw the back and then
the front
imagin my surpris when glanc at the back of the wearisom puzzl
the ink have gone through i clearli made out latin word and among
other craterem and terrestr
i had discov the secret
it came upon me like a flash of lightn i had got the clue all you
had to do to understand the document wa to read it backward all the
ingeni idea of the professor were realiz he had dictat it
rightli to me by a mere accid i had discov what he so much
desir
my delight my emot mai be imagin my ey were dazzl and i
trembl so that at first i could make noth of it on look howev
would tell me all i wish to know
let me read i said to myself after draw a long breath
i spread it befor me on the tabl i pass my finger over each letter
i spell it through in my excit i read it out
what horror and stupefact took possess of my soul i wa like a
man who had receiv a knockdown blow wa it possibl that i realli
read the terribl secret and it had realli been accomplish a man had
dare to dowhat
no live be should ever know
never cri i jump up never shall my uncl be made awar of the
dread secret he would be quit capabl of undertak the terribl
journei noth would check him noth stop him wors he would
compel me to accompani him and we should be lost forev but no such
folli and mad cannot be allow
i wa almost besid myself with rage and furi
my worthi uncl is alreadi nearli mad i cri aloud thi would
finish him by some accid he mai make the discoveri in which case
we ar both lost perish the fear secretlet the flame forev buri
it in oblivion
i snatch up book and parchment and wa about to cast them into the
fire when the door open and my uncl enter
i had scarc time to put down the wretch document befor my uncl
wa by my side he wa profoundli absorb hi thought were evid
bent on the terribl parchment some new combin had probabl struck
him while take hi walk
he seat himself in hi armchair and with a pen began to make an
algebra calcul i watch him with anxiou ey my flesh
crawl as it becam probabl that he would discov the secret
hi combin i knew now were useless i have discov the on
onli clue for three mortal hour he continu without speak a word
without rais hi head scratch rewrit calcul over and
over again i knew that in time he must hit upon the right phrase the
letter of everi alphabet have onli a certain number of combin
but then year might elaps befor he would arriv at the correct
solut
still time went on night came the sound in the street ceasedand
still my uncl went on not even answer our worthi cook when she
call us to supper
i did not dare to leav him so wave her awai and at last fell asleep
on the sofa
when i awok my uncl wa still at work hi red ey hi pallid
counten hi mat hair hi feverish hand hi hectic flush
cheek show how terribl had been hi struggl with the imposs
and what fear fatigu he had undergon dure that long sleepless
night it made me quit ill to look at him though he wa rather sever
with me i love him and my heart ach at hi suffer he wa so
overcom by on idea that he could not even get in a passion all hi
energi were focus on on point and i knew that by speak on
littl word all thi suffer would ceas i could not speak it
my heart wa nevertheless inclin toward him why then did i
remain silent in the interest of my uncl himself
noth shall make me speak i mutter he will want to follow in
the footstep of the other i know him well hi imagin is a
perfect volcano and to make discoveri in the interest of geologi he
would sacrific hi life i will therefor be silent and strictli keep
the secret i have discov to reveal it would be suicid he would
not onli rush himself to destruct but drag me with him
i cross my arm look anoth wai and smokedresolv never to
speak
when our cook want to go out to market or on ani other errand she
found the front door lock and the kei taken awai wa thi done
purpos or not sure professor hardwigg did not intend the old woman
and myself to becom martyr to hi obstin will were we to be
starv to death a fright recollect came to my mind onc we had
fed on bit and scrap for a week while he sort some curios it
gave me the cramp even to think of it
i want my breakfast and i saw no wai of get it still my
resolut held good i would starv rather than yield but the cook
began to take me serious to task what wa to be done she could not
go out and i dare not
my uncl continu count and write hi imagin seem to have
translat him to the ski he neither thought of eat nor drink
in thi wai twelv oclock came round i wa hungri and there wa
noth in the hous the cook had eaten the last bit of bread thi
could not go on it did howev until two when my sensat were
terribl after all i began to think the document veri absurd perhap
it might onli be a gigant hoax besid some mean would sure be
found to keep my uncl back from attempt ani such absurd expedit
on the other hand if he did attempt anyth so quixot i should not
be compel to accompani him anoth line of reason partial
decid me veri like he would make the discoveri himself when i
should have suffer starvat for noth under the influenc of
hunger thi reason appear admir i determin to tell all
the question now aros as to how it wa to be done i wa still dwell
on the thought when he rose and put on hi hat
what go out and lock us in never
uncl i began
he did not appear even to hear me
professor hardwigg i cri
what he retort did you speak
how about the kei
what keyth kei of the door

he look at me from under hi spectacl and start at the odd
express of my face rush forward he clutch me by the arm and
keenli examin my counten hi veri look wa an interrog
i simpli nod
with an incredul shrug of the shoulder he turn upon hi heel
undoubtedli he thought i had gone mad
i have made a veri import discoveri
hi ey flash with excit hi hand wa lift in a menac
attitud for a moment neither of us spoke it is hard to sai which wa
most excit
you dont mean to sai that you have ani idea of the mean of the
scrawl
i do wa my desper repli look at the sentenc as dictat by
you
well but it mean noth wa the angri answer
noth if you read from left to right but mark if from right to
left
backward cri my uncl in wild amaz oh most cun
saknussemm and i to be such a blockhead
he snatch up the document gaze at it with haggard ey and read it
out as i had done
it read as follow

which dog latin be translat read as follow
descend into the crater of yocul of sneffel which the shade of
scartari caress befor the kalend of juli audaci travel
and you will reach the centr of the earth i did it
arn saknussemm
my uncl leap three feet from the ground with joi he look radiant
and handsom he rush about the room wild with delight and
satisfact he knock over tabl and chair he threw hi book
about until at last utterli exhaust he fell into hi armchair
what oclock he ask
about three

profound secret there is no more enviou race of men than scientif
discover mani would start on the same journei at all event we
will be the first in the field
i doubt your have mani competitor wa my repli
a man of real scientif acquir would be delight at the chanc
we should find a perfect stream of pilgrim on the trace of arn
saknussemm if thi document were onc made public
but my dear sir is not thi paper veri like to be a hoax i urg
the book in which we find it is suffici proof of it authent
he repli
i thoroughli allow that the celebr professor wrote the line but
onli i believ as a kind of mystif wa my answer

them my uncl look at me with a dark and gloomi scowl and i began to
be alarm for the result of our convers hi mood soon chang
howev and a smile took the place of a frown
we shall see he remark with decis emphasi
but see what is all thi about yocul and sneffel and thi
scartari i have never heard anyth about them

chapter 4
we start on the journei
you see the whole island is compos of volcano said the
professor and remark carefulli that thei all bear the name of yocul
the word is iceland and mean a glacier in most of the lofti
mountain of that region the volcan erupt come forth from icebound
cavern henc the name appli to everi volcano on thi extraordinari
island
but what doe thi word sneffel mean
to thi question i expect no ration answer i wa mistaken
follow my finger to the western coast of iceland there you see
reykjavik it capit follow the direct of on of it innumer
fjord or arm of the sea and what do you see below the sixtyfifth
degre of latitud
a peninsulaveri like a thighbon in shape
and in the centr of it
a mountain
well that sneffel
i had noth to sai
that is sneffelsa mountain about five thousand feet in height on of
the most remark in the whole island and certainli doom to be the
most celebr in the world for through it crater we shall reach the
centr of the earth
imposs cri i startl and shock at the thought
why imposs said professor hardwigg in hi severest tone
becaus it crater is choke with lava by burn rocksbi infinit
danger
but if it be extinct
that would make a differ
of cours it would there ar about three hundr volcano on the
whole surfac of the globebut the greater number ar extinct of these
sneffel is on no erupt ha occur sinc 1219in fact it ha
ceas to be a volcano at all
after thi what more could i sai yesi thought of anoth object
but what is all thi about scartari and the kalend of juli
my uncl reflect deepli present he gave forth the result of hi
reflect in a sententi tone what appear obscur to you to me
is light thi veri phrase show how particular saknussemm is in hi
direct the sneffel mountain ha mani crater he is care
therefor to point the exact on which is the highwai into the interior
of the earth he let us know for thi purpos that about the end of
the month of june the shadow of mount scartari fall upon the on
crater there can be no doubt about the matter
my uncl had an answer for everyth
i accept all your explan i said and saknussemm is right he
found out the entranc to the bowel of the earth he ha indic
correctli but that he or anyon els ever follow up the discoveri is
mad to suppos
why so young man
all scientif teach theoret and practic show it to be
imposs
i care noth for theori retort my uncl
but is it not wellknown that heat increas on degre for everi
seventi feet you descend into the earth which give a fine idea of the
central heat all the matter which compos the globe ar in a state of
incandesc even gold platinum and the hardest rock ar in a state
of fusion what would becom of us
dont be alarm at the heat my boi
how so
neither you nor anybodi els know anyth about the real state of the
earth interior all modern experi tend to explod the older
theori were ani such heat to exist the upper crust of the earth
would be shatter to atom and the world would be at an end
a long learn and not uninterest discuss follow which end
in thi wise
i do not believ in the danger and difficulti which you henri seem
to multipli and the onli wai to learn is like arn saknussemm to go
and see
well cri i overcom at last let us go and see though how we can
do that in the dark is anoth mysteri
fear noth we shall overcom these and mani other difficulti
besid as we approach the centr i expect to find it lumin
noth is imposs
and now that we have come to a thorough understand not a word to
ani live soul our success depend on secreci and dispatch
thu end our memor confer which rous a perfect fever in me
leav my uncl i went forth like on possess reach the bank of
the elb i began to think wa all i had heard realli and truli
possibl wa my uncl in hi sober sens and could the interior of
the earth be reach wa i the victim of a madman or wa he a
discover of rare courag and grandeur of concept
to a certain extent i wa anxiou to be off i wa afraid my enthusiasm
would cool i determin to pack up at onc at the end of an hour
howev on my wai home i found that my feel had veri much chang
im all abroad i cri ti a nightmarei must have dream it
at thi moment i came face to face with gretchen whom i warmli
embrac
so you have come to meet me she said how good of you but what is
the matter
well it wa no us minc the matter i told her all she listen
with aw and for some minut she could not speak
well i at last said rather anxious
what a magnific journei if i were onli a man a journei worthi of
the nephew of professor hardwigg i should look upon it as an honor to
accompani him
my dear gretchen i thought you would be the first to cry out against
thi mad enterpris
no on the contrari i glori in it it is magnific splendidan
idea worthi of my father henri lawson i envi you
thi wa as it were conclus the final blow of all
when we enter the hous we found my uncl surround by workmen and
porter who were pack up he wa pull and haul at a bell
where have you been wast your time your portmanteau is not
packedmi paper ar not in orderth preciou tailor ha not brought
my cloth nor my gaitersth kei of my carpet bag is gone
i look at him stupefi and still he tug awai at the bell
we ar realli off then i said

and when do we go
the dai after tomorrow at daybreak

myself in there wa no doubt about it now my uncl had been hard at
work all the afternoon the garden wa full of rope rope ladder

window but as we pass through a flat though fertil countri thi
occup wa slightli monoton in three hour we reach kiel and
our baggag wa at onc transfer to the steamer
we had now a dai befor us a delai of about ten hour which fact put
my uncl in a tower passion we had noth to do but to walk about
the pretti town and bai at length howev we went on board and at
half past ten were steam down the great belt it wa a dark night
with a strong breez and a rough sea noth be visibl but the
occasion fire on shore with here and there a lighthous at seven in
the morn we left korsor a littl town on the western side of
seeland
here we took anoth railwai which in three hour brought us to the
capit copenhagen where scarc take time for refresh my
uncl hurri out to present on of hi letter of introduct it wa
to the director of the museum of antiqu who have been inform
that we were tourist bound for iceland did all he could to assist us
on wretch hope sustain me now perhap no vessel wa bound for such
distant part
ala a littl danish schooner the ivalkyriei wa to sail on the
second of june for reykjavik the captain m bjarn wa on board and
wa rather surpris at the energi and cordial with which hi futur
passeng shook him by the hand to him a voyag to iceland wa mere a
matter of cours my uncl on the other hand consid the event of
sublim import the honest sailor took advantag of the professor
enthusiasm to doubl the fare
on tuesdai morn at seven oclock be on board said m bjarn

excel capit gloriou remark my uncl as we sat down to a
late breakfast refresh yourself my boi and we will take a run
through the town
our meal conclud we went to the kongensnyetorw to the king
magnific palac to the beauti bridg over the canal near the
museum to the immens cenotaph of thorwaldsen with it hideou naval
group to the castl of rosenberg and to all the other lion of the
placenon of which my uncl even saw so absorb wa he in hi
anticip triumph
but on thing struck hi fanci and that wa a certain singular steepl
situat on the island of amak which is the southeast quarter of the
citi of copenhagen my uncl at onc order me to turn my step that
wai and accordingli we went on board the steam ferri boat which doe
duti on the canal and veri soon reach the note dockyard quai
in the first instanc we cross some narrow street where we met
numer group of gallei slave with particolor trouser grei and
yellow work under the order and the stick of sever taskmast
and final reach the vorfrelserskirk
thi church exhibit noth remark in itself in fact the worthi
professor had onli been attract to it by on circumst which wa
that it rather elev steepl start from a circular platform after
which there wa an exterior staircas which wound round to the veri
summit
let us ascend said my uncl
but i never could climb church tower i cri i am subject to
dizzi in my head
the veri reason why you should go up i want to cure you of a bad
habit
but my good sir
i tell you to come what is the us of wast so much valuabl time
it wa imposs to disput the dictatori command of my uncl i
yield with a groan on payment of a fee a verger gave us the kei he
for on wa not partial to the ascent my uncl at onc show me the
wai run up the step like a schoolboi i follow as well as i
could though no sooner wa i outsid the tower than my head began to
swim there wa noth of the eagl about me the earth wa enough for
me and no ambiti desir to soar ever enter my mind still thing
did not go badli until i had ascend 150 step and wa near the
platform when i began to feel the rush of cold air i could scarc
stand when clutch the rail i look upward the rail wa
frail enough but noth to those which skirt the terribl wind
staircas that appear from where i stood to ascend to the ski
now then henri
i cant do it i cri in accent of despair
ar you after all a coward sir said my uncl in a pitiless tone
go up i sai
to thi there wa no repli possibl and yet the keen air act
violent on my nervou system sky earth all seem to swim round
while the steepl rock like a ship my leg gave wai like those of a
drunken man i crawl upon my hand and knee i haul myself up
slowli crawl like a snake present i close my ey and allow
myself to be drag upward
look around you said my uncl in a stern voic heaven know what
profound abyss you mai have to look down thi is excel practic
slowli and shiver all the while with cold i open my ey what
then did i see my first glanc wa upward at the cold fleeci cloud
which as by some optic delus appear to stand still while the
steepl the weathercock and our two selv were carri swiftli along
far awai on on side could be seen the grassi plain while on the other
lai the sea bath in transluc light the sund or sound as we call
it could be discov beyond the point of elsinor crowd with white
sail which at that distanc look like the wing of seagul while
to the east could be made out the faroff coast of sweden the whole
appear a magic panorama
but faint and bewild as i wa there wa no remedi for it rise and
stand up i must despit my protest my first lesson last quit
an hour when nearli two hour later i reach the bosom of mother
earth i wa like a rheumat old man bent doubl with pain
enough for on dai said my uncl rub hi hand we will begin
again tomorrow
there wa no remedi my lesson last five dai and at the end of that
period i ascend blith enough and found myself abl to look down
into the depth below without even wink and with some degre of
pleasur
chapter 6
our voyag to iceland
the hour of departur came at last the night befor the worthi mr
thompson brought us the most cordial letter of introduct for baron
tramp governor of iceland for m pictursson coadjutor to the bishop
and for m finsen mayor of the town of reykjavik in return my uncl
nearli crush hi hand so warmli did he shake them
on the second of the month at two in the morn our preciou cargo of
luggag wa taken on board the good ship ivalkyriei we follow and
were veri polit introduc by the captain to a small cabin with two
stand bed place neither veri well ventil nor veri comfort
but in the caus of scienc men ar expect to suffer
well and have we a fair wind cri my uncl in hi most melliflu
accent
an excel wind repli captain bjarn we shall leav the sound
go free with all sail set
a few minut afterward the schooner start befor the wind under
all the canva she could carri and enter the channel an hour later
the capit of denmark seem to sink into the wave and we were at no
great distanc from the coast of elsinor my uncl wa delight for
myself moodi and dissatisfi i appear almost to expect a glimps of
the ghost of hamlet
sublim madman thought i you doubtless would approv our
proceed you might perhap even follow us to the centr of the
earth there to resolv your etern doubt
but no ghost or anyth els appear upon the ancient wall the fact
is the castl is much later than the time of the heroic princ of
denmark it is now the resid of the keeper of the strait of the
sound and through that sound more than fifteen thousand vessel of all
nation pass everi year
the castl of kronborg soon disappear in the murki atmospher as well
as the tower of helsinborg which rais it head on the swedish bank
and here the schooner began to feel in earnest the breez of the
kattegat the ivalkyriei wa swift enough but with all sail boat
there is the same uncertainti her cargo wa coal furnitur potteri
woolen cloth and a load of corn as usual the crew wa small five
dane do the whole of the work
how long will the voyag last ask my uncl
well i should think about ten dai repli the skipper unless
inde we meet with some northeast gale among the faro island
at all event there will be no veri consider delai cri the
impati professor
no mr hardwigg said the captain no fear of that at all event
we shall get there some dai
toward even the schooner doubl cape skagen the northernmost part
of denmark cross the skagerrak dure the nightskirt the extrem
point of norwai through the gut of cape lindesn and then reach the
northern sea two dai later we were not far from the coast of
scotland somewher near what danish sailor call peterhead and then
the ivalkyriei stretch out direct for the faro island between
orknei and shetland our vessel now felt the full forc of the ocean
wave and the wind shift we with great difficulti made the faro
isl on the eighth dai the captain made out mygan the
westernmost of the isl and from that moment head direct for
portland a cape on the southern shore of the singular island for which
we were bound
the voyag offer no incid worthi of record i bore it veri well
but my uncl to hi great annoy and even shame wa remark
seasick thi mal de mer troubl him the more that it prevent him
from question captain bjarn as to the subject of sneffel as to the
mean of commun and the facil of transport all these
explan he had to adjourn to the period of hi arriv hi time
meanwhil wa spent ly in bed groan and dwell anxious on
the hopedfor termin of the voyag i didnt piti him
on the eleventh dai we sight cape portland over which tower mount
myrdal yokul which the weather be clear we made out veri readili
the cape itself is noth but a huge mount of granit stand nake
and alon to meet the atlant wave the ivalkyriei kept off the coast
steer to the westward on all side were to be seen whole school
of whale and shark after some hour we came in sight of a solitari
rock in the ocean form a mighti vault through which the foam
wave pour with intens furi the islet of westman appear to leap
from the ocean be so low in the water as scarc to be seen until
you were right upon them from that moment the schooner wa steer to
the westward in order to round cape reykjan the western point of
iceland
my uncl to hi great disgust wa unabl even to crawl on deck so
heavi a sea wa on and thu lost the first view of the land of promis
fortyeight hour later after a storm which drove us far to sea under
bare pole we came onc more in sight of land and were board by a
pilot who after three hour of danger navig brought the
schooner safe to an anchor in the bai of faxa befor reykjavik
my uncl came out of hi cabin pale haggard thin but full of
enthusiasm hi ey dilat with pleasur and satisfact nearli the
whole popul of the town wa on foot to see us land the fact wa
that scarc ani on of them but expect some good by the period
vessel
professor hardwigg wa in hast to leav hi prison or rather as he
call it hi hospit but befor he attempt to do so he caught
hold of my hand led me to the quarterdeck of the schooner took my arm
with hi left hand and point inland with hi right over the northern
part of the bai to where rose a high twopeak mountaina doubl cone
cover with etern snow
behold he whisper in an awestricken voic beholdmount sneffel
then without further remark he put hi finger to hi lip frown
darkli and descend into the small boat which await us i follow
and in a few minut we stood upon the soil of mysteri iceland
scarc were we fairli on shore when there appear befor us a man of
excel appear wear the costum of a militari offic he wa
howev but a civil servant a magistr the governor of the
islandbaron tramp the professor knew whom he had to deal with he
therefor hand him the letter from copenhagen and a brief
convers in danish follow to which i of cours wa a stranger
and for a veri good reason for i did not know the languag in which
thei convers i afterward heard howev that baron tramp place
himself entir at the beck and call of professor hardwigg
my uncl wa most gracious receiv by m finsen the mayor who as
far as costum went wa quit as militari as the governor but also
from charact and occup quit as pacif as for hi coadjutor m
pictursson he wa absent on an episcop visit to the northern portion
of the dioces we were therefor compel to defer the pleasur of
be present to him hi absenc wa howev more than compens
by the presenc of m fridriksson professor of natur scienc in the
colleg of reykjavik a man of invalu abil thi modest scholar
spoke no languag save iceland and latin when therefor he
address himself to me in the languag of horac we at onc came to
understand on anoth he wa in fact the onli person that i did
thoroughli understand dure the whole period of my resid in thi
benight island
out of three room of which hi hous wa compos two were place at
our servic and in a few hour we were instal with all our baggag
the amount of which rather astonish the simpl inhabit of
reykjavik
now harri said my uncl rub hi hand an goe well the wors
difficulti is now over
how the wors difficulti over i cri in fresh amaz
doubtless here we ar in iceland noth more remain but to descend
into the bowel of the earth
well sir to a certain extent you ar right we have onli to go
downbut as far as i am concern that is not the question i want to
know how we ar to get up again
that is the least part of the busi and doe not in ani wai troubl
me in the meantim there is not an hour to lose i am about to visit
the public librari veri like i mai find there some manuscript from
the hand of saknussemm i shall be glad to consult them
in the meanwhil i repli i will take a walk through the town
will you not likewis do so
i feel no interest in the subject said my uncl what for me is
curiou in thi island is not what is abov the surfac but what is
below
i bow by wai of repli put on my hat and fur cloak and went out
it wa not an easi matter to lose oneself in the two street of
reykjavik i had therefor no need to ask my wai the town li on a
flat and marshi plain between two hill a vast field of lava skirt it
on on side fall awai in terrac toward the sea on the other hand
is the larg bai of faxa border on the north by the enorm glacier
of sneffel and in which bai the ivalkyriei wa then the onli vessel at
anchor gener there were on or two english or french gunboat to
watch and protect the fisheri in the of thei were now howev
absent on duti
the longest of the street of reykjavik run parallel to the shore in
thi street the merchant and trader live in wooden hut made with
beam of wood paint redmer log hut such as you find in the wild
of america the other street situat more to the west run toward a
littl lake between the resid of the bishop and the other
personag not engag in commerc
i had soon seen all i want of these weari and dismal thoroughfar
here and there wa a strip of discolor turf like an old wornout bit
of woolen carpet and now and then a bit of kitchen garden in which
grew potato cabbag and lettuc almost diminut enough to suggest
the idea of lilliput
in the centr of the new commerci street i found the public cemeteri
enclos by an earthen wall though not veri larg it appear not
like to be fill for centuri from henc i went to the hous of the
governora mere hut in comparison with the mansion hous of
hamburgbut a palac alongsid the other iceland hous between the
littl lake and the town wa the church built in simpl protest
style and compos of calcin stone thrown up by volcan action i
have not the slightest doubt that in high wind it red tile were blown
out to the great annoy of the pastor and congreg upon an
emin close at hand wa the nation school in which were taught
hebrew english french and danish
in three hour my tour wa complet the gener impress upon my mind
wa sad no tree no veget so to speakon all side volcan
peaksth hut of turf and earthmor like roof than hous thank
to the heat of these resid grass grow on the roof which grass is
carefulli cut for hai i saw but few inhabit dure my excurs
but i met a crowd on the beach dry salt and load codfish the
princip articl of export the men appear robust but heavi
fairhair like german but of pensiv mienexil of a higher scale
in the ladder of human than the eskimo but i thought much more
unhappi sinc with superior percept thei ar compel to live
within the limit of the polar circl
sometim thei gave vent to a convuls laugh but by no chanc did
thei smile their costum consist of a coars capot of black wool
known in scandinavian countri as the vadmel a broadbrim hat
trouser of red serg and a piec of leather ti with string for a
shoea coars kind of moccasin the women though sadlook and
mourn had rather agreeabl featur without much express thei
wear a bodic and petticoat of somber vadmel when unmarri thei wear a
littl brown knit cap over a crown of plait hair but when marri
thei cover their head with a color handkerchief over which thei tie
a white scarf

convers and discoveri
when i return dinner wa readi thi meal wa devour by my worthi
rel with avid and vorac hi shipboard diet had turn hi
interior into a perfect gulf the repast which wa more danish than
iceland wa in itself noth but the excess hospit of our
host made us enjoi it doubli
the convers turn upon scientif matter and m fridriksson
ask my uncl what he thought of the public librari
librari sir cri my uncl it appear to me a collect of
useless odd volum and a beggarli amount of empti shelv
what cri m fridriksson why we have eight thousand volum of
most rare and valuabl workssom in the scandinavian languag besid
all the new public from copenhagen
eight thousand volum my dear sirwhi where ar thei cri my
uncl
scatter over the countri professor hardwigg we ar veri studiou
my dear sir though we do live in iceland everi farmer everi labor
everi fisherman can both read and writeand we think that book instead
of be lock up in cupboard far from the sight of student should
be distribut as wide as possibl the book of our librari ar
therefor pass from hand to hand without return to the librari
shelv perhap for year
then when foreign visit you there is noth for them to see
well sir foreign have their own librari and our first
consider is that our humbler class should be highli educ
fortun the love of studi is innat in the iceland peopl in
1816 we found a literari societi and mechan institut mani
foreign scholar of emin ar honorari member we publish book
destin to educ our peopl and these book have render valuabl
servic to our countri allow me to have the honor professor hardwigg
to enrol you as an honorari member
my uncl who alreadi belong to nearli everi literari and scientif
institut in europ immedi yield to the amiabl wish of good
m fridriksson
and now he said after mani express of gratitud and good will
if you will tell me what book you expect to find perhap i mai be
of some assist to you
i watch my uncl keenli for a minut or two he hesit as if
unwil to speak to speak openli wa perhap to unveil hi
project nevertheless after some reflect he made up hi mind
well m fridriksson he said in an easi unconcern kind of wai i
wa desir of ascertain if among other valuabl work you had ani
of the learn arn saknussemm
arn saknussemm cri the professor of reykjavik you speak of on
of the most distinguish scholar of the sixteenth centuri of the
great naturalist the great alchemist the great travel
exactli so
on of the most distinguish men connect with iceland scienc and
literatur
as you sai sir
a man illustri abov all
ye sir all thi is true but hi work
we have none of them
not in iceland
there ar none in iceland or elsewher answer the other sadli
why so
becaus arn saknussemm wa persecut for heresi and in 1573 hi
work were publicli burnt at copenhagen by the hand of the common
hangman
veri good capit murmur my uncl to the great astonish of
the worthi iceland
you said sir
ye ye all is clear i see the link in the chain everyth is
explain and i now understand why arn saknussemm put out of court
forc to hide hi magnific discoveri wa compel to conceal
beneath the veil of an incomprehens cryptograph the secret
what secret
a secretwhich stammer my uncl
have you discov some wonder manuscript cri m fridriksson
no no i wa carri awai by my enthusiasm a mere supposit
veri good sir but realli to turn to anoth subject i hope you
will not leav our island without examin into it mineralog
rich
well the fact is i am rather late so mani learn men have been here
befor me
ye ye but there is still much to be done cri m fridriksson
you think so said my uncl hi ey twinkl with hidden
satisfact
ye you have no idea how mani unknown mountain glacier volcano
there ar which remain to be studi without move from where we sit
i can show you on yonder on the edg of the horizon you see
sneffel
oh ye sneffel said my uncl
on of the most curiou volcano in exist the crater of which ha
been rare visit
extinct
extinct ani time these five hundr year wa the readi repli
well said my uncl who dug hi nail into hi flesh and press hi
knee tightli togeth to prevent himself leap up with joi i have a
great mind to begin my studi with an examin of the geolog
mysteri of thi mount seffelfeiselwhat do you call it
sneffel my dear sir
thi portion of the convers took place in latin and i therefor
understood all that had been said i could scarc keep my counten
when i found my uncl so cunningli conceal hi delight and
satisfact i must confess that hi art grimac put on to conceal
hi happi made him look like a new mephistophel
ye ye he continu your proposit delight me i will endeavor
to climb to the summit of sneffel and if possibl will descend into
it crater
i veri much regret continu m fridriksson that my occup will
entir preclud the possibl of my accompani you it would have
been both pleasur and profit if i could have spare the time
no no a thousand time no cri my uncl i do not wish to disturb
the seren of ani man i thank you howev with all my heart the
presenc of on so learn as yourself would no doubt have been most
us but the duti of your offic and profess befor everyth
in the innoc of hi simpl heart our host did not perceiv the
ironi of these remark
i entir approv your project continu the iceland after some
further remark it is a good idea to begin by examin thi volcano
you will make a harvest of curiou observ in the first place how
do you propos to get to sneffel
by sea i shall cross the bai of cours that is the most rapid rout
of cours but still it cannot be done
why
we have not an avail boat in all reykjavik repli the other
what is to be done
you must go by land along the coast it is longer but much more
interest
then i must have a guid
of cours and i have your veri man
somebodi on whom i can depend
ye an inhabit of the peninsula on which sneffel is situat he
is a veri shrewd and worthi man with whom you will be pleas he
speak danish like a dane
when can i see himtodai
no tomorrow he will not be here befor
tomorrow be it repli my uncl with a deep sigh
the convers end by compliment on both side dure the dinner
my uncl had learn much as to the histori of arn saknussemm the
reason for hi mysteri and hieroglyph document he also becam
awar that hi host would not accompani him on hi adventur
expedit and that next dai we should have a guid
chapter 8
the eiderdown hunteroff at last
that even i took a brief walk on the shore near reykjavik after
which i return to an earli sleep on my bed of coars plank where i
slept the sleep of the just when i awok i heard my uncl speak
loudli in the next room i rose hastili and join him he wa talk
in danish with a man of tall statur and of perfectli herculean build
thi man appear to be possess of veri great strength hi ey
which start rather promin from a veri larg head the face
belong to which wa simpl and naiv appear veri quick and
intellig veri long hair which even in england would have been
account exceedingli red fell over hi athlet shoulder thi nativ
of iceland wa activ and suppl in appear though he scarc move
hi arm be in fact on of those men who despis the habit of
gesticul common to southern peopl
everyth in thi man manner reveal a calm and phlegmat
tempera there wa noth indol about him but hi appear
spoke of tranquil he wa on of those who never seem to expect
anyth from anybodi who like to work when he thought proper and
whose philosophi noth could astonish or troubl
i began to comprehend hi charact simpli from the wai in which he
listen to the wild and impass verbiag of my worthi uncl while
the excel professor spoke sentenc after sentenc he stood with
fold arm utterli still motionless to all my uncl gesticul
when he want to sai no he move hi head from left to right when he
acquiesc he nod so slightli that you could scarc see the
undul of hi head thi economi of motion wa carri to the length
of avaric
judg from hi appear i should have been a long time befor i had
suspect him to be what he wa a mighti hunter certainli hi manner
wa not like to frighten the game how then did he contriv to get
at hi prei
my surpris wa slightli modifi when i knew that thi tranquil and
solemn personag wa onli a hunter of the eider duck the down of which
is after all the greatest sourc of the iceland wealth
in the earli dai of summer the femal of the eider a pretti sort of
duck build it nest amid the rock of the fjordsth name given to
all narrow gulf in scandinavian countrieswith which everi part of the
island is indent no sooner ha the eider duck made her nest than she
line the insid of it with the softest down from her breast then come
the hunter or trader take awai the nest the poor bereav femal
begin her task over again and thi continu as long as ani eider down
is to be found
when she can find no more the male bird set to work to see what he can
do as howev hi down is not so soft and ha therefor no
commerci valu the hunter doe not take the troubl to rob him of hi
nest line the nest is accordingli finish the egg ar laid the
littl on ar born and next year the harvest of eider down is again
collect
now as the eider duck never select steep rock or aspect to build it
nest but rather slope and low cliff near to the sea the iceland
hunter can carri on hi trade oper without much difficulti he is
like a farmer who ha neither to plow to sow nor to harrow onli to
collect hi harvest
thi grave sententi silent person as phlegmat as an englishman
on the french stage wa name han bjelk he had call upon us in
consequ of the recommend of m fridriksson he wa in fact
our futur guid it struck me that had i sought the world over i could
not have found a greater contradict to my impuls uncl

thought about monei on wa readi to take all that wa offer him the
other readi to offer anyth that wa ask it mai readili be
conceiv then that an understand wa soon come to between them
now the understand wa that he wa to take us to the villag of
stapi situat on the southern slope of the peninsula of sneffel at
the veri foot of the volcano han the guid told us the distanc wa
about twentytwo mile a journei which my uncl suppos would take
about two dai
but when my uncl came to understand that thei were danish mile of
eight thousand yard each he wa oblig to be more moder in hi
idea and consid the horribl road we had to follow to allow
eight or ten dai for the journei
four hors were prepar for us two to carri the baggag and two to
bear the import weight of myself and uncl han declar that
noth ever would make him climb on the back of ani anim he knew
everi inch of that part of the coast and promis to take us the veri

there were yet fortyeight hour to elaps befor we made our final
start to my great regret our whole time wa taken up in make
prepar for our journei all our industri and abil were devot
to pack everi object in the most advantag mannerth instrument
on on side the arm on the other the tool here and the provis
there there were in fact four distinct group
the instrument were of cours of the best manufactur
1 a centigrad thermomet of eigel count up to 150 degre which
to me did not appear half enoughor too much too hot by half if the
degre of heat wa to ascend so highin which case we should certainli
be cookednot enough if we want to ascertain the exact temperatur
of spring or metal in a state of fusion
2 a manomet work by compress air an instrument us to ascertain

our arm consist of two rifl with two revolv sixshoot why
these arm were provid it wa imposs for me to sai i had everi
reason to believ that we had neither wild beast nor savag nativ to
fear my uncl on the other hand wa quit as devot to hi arsen
as to hi collect of instrument and abov all wa veri care with
hi provis of fulmin or gun cotton warrant to keep in ani

that of ordinari gunpowd
our tool consist of two pickax two crowbar a silken ladder
three ironshod alpin pole a hatchet a hammer a dozen wedg some
point piec of iron and a quantiti of strong rope you mai conceiv
that the whole made a toler parcel especi when i mention that
the ladder itself wa three hundr feet long
then there came the import question of provis the hamper wa not
veri larg but toler satisfactori for i knew that in concentr
essenc of meat and biscuit there wa enough to last six month the
onli liquid provid by my uncl wa schiedam of water not a drop we
had howev an ampl suppli of gourd and my uncl count on find
water and enough to fill them as soon as we commenc our downward
journei my remark as to the temperatur the qualiti and even as to
the possibl of none be found remain wholli without effect

my uncl had also been care to lai in a goodli suppli of tobacco

belt cram full of note and gold good boot render watertight were
to be found to the number of six in the tool box
my boi with such cloth with such boot and such gener
equip said my uncl in a state of raptur delight we mai hope
to travel far
it took a whole dai to put all these matter in order in the even we
dine with baron tramp in compani with the mayor of reykjavik and
doctor hyaltalin the great medic man of iceland m fridriksson wa
not present and i wa afterward sorri to hear that he and the governor
did not agre on some matter connect with the administr of the
island unfortun the consequ wa that i did not understand a
word that wa said at dinnera kind of semioffici recept on
thing i can sai my uncl never left off speak
the next dai our labor came to an end our worthi host delight my
uncl professor hardwigg by give him a good map of iceland a most
import and preciou document for a mineralogist
our last even wa spent in a long convers with m fridriksson
whom i like veri muchth more that i never expect to see him or
anyon els again after thi agreeabl wai of spend an hour or so i
tri to sleep in vain with the except of a few doze my night wa
miser
at five oclock in the morn i wa awaken from the onli real half
hour sleep of the night by the loud neigh of hors under my
window i hastili dress myself and went down into the street han wa
engag in put the finish stroke to our baggag which he did in
a silent quiet wai that won my admir and yet he did it admir
well my uncl wast a great deal of breath in give him direct

at six oclock all our prepar were complet and m fridriksson
shook hand heartili with us my uncl thank him warmli in the
iceland languag for hi kind hospit speak truli from the

as for myself i put togeth a few of my best latin phrase and paid him
the highest compliment i could thi fratern and friendli duti

chapter 9
our startw meet with adventur by the wai
the weather wa overcast but settl when we commenc our adventur
and peril journei we had neither to fear fatigu heat nor
drench rain it wa in fact real tourist weather
as there wa noth i like better than hors exercis the pleasur of
ride through an unknown countri caus the earli part of our
enterpris to be particularli agreeabl to me
i began to enjoi the exhilar delight of travel a life of
desir gratif and liberti the truth is that my spirit rose so
rapidli that i began to be indiffer to what had onc appear to be
a terribl journei
after all i said to myself what do i risk simpli to take a journei
through a curiou countri to climb a remark mountain and if the
worst come to the worst to descend into the crater of an extinct
volcano
there could be no doubt that thi wa all thi terribl saknussemm had
done as to the exist of a galleri or of subterran passag
lead into the interior of the earth the idea wa simpli absurd the
hallucin of a distemp imagin all then that mai be
requir of me i will do cheerfulli and will creat no difficulti
it wa just befor we left reykjavik that i came to thi decis
han our extraordinari guid went first walk with a steadi rapid
unvari step our two hors with the luggag follow of their own
accord without requir whip or spur my uncl and i came behind
cut a veri toler figur upon our small but vigor anim
iceland is on of the largest island in europ it contain thirti
thousand squar mile of surfac and ha about seventi thousand
inhabit geograph have divid it into four part and we had to
cross the southwest quarter which in the vernacular is call sudvestr
fjordungr
han on take hi departur from reykjavik had follow the line of
the sea we took our wai through poor and spars meadow which made a
desper effort everi year to show a littl green thei veri rare
succe in a good show of yellow
the rug summit of the rocki hill were dimli visibl on the edg of
the horizon through the misti fog everi now and then some heavi
flake of snow show conspicu in the morn light while certain
lofti and point rock were first lost in the grei low cloud their
summit clearli visibl abov like jag reef rise from a troublou
sea
everi now and then a spur of rock came down through the arid ground
leav us scarc room to pass our hors howev appear not onli
well acquaint with the countri but by a kind of instinct knew which
wa the best road my uncl had not even the satisfact of urg
forward hi steed by whip spur or voic it wa utterli useless to
show ani sign of impati i could not help smile to see him look
so big on hi littl hors hi long leg now and then touch the
ground made him look like a sixfoot centaur
good beast good beast he would cry i assur you that i begin to
think no anim is more intellig than an iceland hors snow
tempest impractic road rock icebergsnoth stop him he is
brave he is sober he is safe he never make a fals step never
glide or slip from hi path i dare to sai that if ani river ani
fjord ha to be crossedand i have no doubt there will be manyy
will see him enter the water without hesit like an amphibi
anim and reach the opposit side in safeti we must not howev
attempt to hurri him we must allow him to have hi own wai and i
will undertak to sai that between us we shall do our ten leagu a
dai
we mai do so wa my repli but what about our worthi guid
i have not the slightest anxieti about him that sort of peopl go
ahead without know even what thei ar about look at han he move
so littl that it is imposs for him to becom fatigu besid if
he were to complain of weari he could have the loan of my hors i
should have a violent attack of the cramp if i were not to have some
sort of exercis my arm ar rightbut my leg ar get a littl
stiff
all thi while we were advanc at a rapid pace the countri we had
reach wa alreadi nearli a desert here and there could be seen an
isol farm some solitari bur or iceland hous built of wood
earth fragment of lavalook like beggar on the highwai of life
these wretch and miser hut excit in us such piti that we felt
half dispos to leav alm at everi door in thi countri there ar no
road path ar nearli unknown and veget poor as it wa slowli
as it reach perfect soon obliter all trace of the few
travel who pass from place to place
nevertheless thi divis of the provinc situat onli a few mile
from the capit is consid on of the best cultiv and most
thickli peopl in all iceland what then must be the state of the
less known and more distant part of the island after travel fulli
half a danish mile we had met neither a farmer at the door of hi hut
nor even a wander shepherd with hi wild and savag flock
a few strai cow and sheep were onli seen occasion what then must
we expect when we come to the upheav regionsto the district broken
and roughen from volcan erupt and subterran commot
we were to learn thi all in good time i saw howev on consult
the map that we avoid a good deal of thi rough countri by follow
the wind and desol shore of the sea in realiti the great
volcan movement of the island and all it attend phenomena ar
concentr in the interior of the island there horizont layer or
strata of rock pile on upon the other erupt of basalt origin
and stream of lava have given thi countri a kind of supernatur
reput
littl did i expect howev the spectacl which await us when we
reach the peninsula of sneffel where agglomer of natur
ruin form a kind of terribl chao
some two hour or more after we had left the citi of reykjavik we
reach the littl town call aoalkirkja or the princip church it
consist simpli of a few housesnot what in england or germani we
should call a hamlet
han stop here on half hour he share our frugal breakfast
answer ye and no to my uncl question as to the natur of the
road and at last when ask where we were to pass the night wa as
lacon as usual
gardar wa hi oneword repli
i took occas to consult the map to see where gardar wa to be found
after look keenli i found a small town of that name on the border of
the hvalfjord about four mile from reykjavik i point thi out to my
uncl who made a veri energet grimac
onli four mile out of twentytwo why it is onli a littl walk
he wa about to make some energet observ to the guid but han
without take the slightest notic of him went in front of the hors
and walk ahead with the same imperturb phlegm he had alwai
exhibit
three hour later still travel over those appar intermin
and sandi prairi we were compel to go round the kollafjord an
easier and shorter cut than cross the gulf shortli after we enter
a place of commun jurisdict call ejulberg and the clock of which
would then have struck twelv if ani iceland church had been rich
enough to possess so valuabl and us an articl these sacr
edific ar howev veri much like these peopl who do without
watchesand never miss them
here the hors were allow to take some rest and refresh then
follow a narrow strip of shore between high rock and the sea thei
took us without further halt to the aoalkirkja of brantar and after
anoth mile to saurboer annexia a chapel of eas situat on the
southern bank of the hvalfjord
it wa four oclock in the even and we had travel four danish
mile about equal to twenti english
the fjord wa in thi place about half a mile in width the sweep and
broken wave came roll in upon the point rock the gulf wa
surround by rocki wallsa mighti cliff three thousand feet in
height remark for it brown strata separ here and there by
bed of tufa of a reddish hue now whatev mai have been the
intellig of our hors i had not the slightest relianc upon them
as a mean of cross a stormi arm of the sea to ride over salt water
upon the back of a littl hors seem to me absurd
if thei ar realli intellig i said to myself thei will certainli
not make the attempt in ani case i shall trust rather to my own
intellig than their
but my uncl wa in no humor to wait he dug hi heel into the side of
hi steed and made for the shore hi hors went to the veri edg of
the water snif at the approach wave and retreat
my uncl who wa sooth to sai quit as obstin as the beast he
bestrod insist on hi make the desir advanc thi attempt wa
follow by a new refus on the part of the hors which quietli shook
hi head thi demonstr of rebellion wa follow by a vollei of
word and a stout applic of whipcord also follow by kick on the
part of the hors which threw it head and heel upward and tri to
throw hi rider at length the sturdi littl poni spread out hi
leg in a stiff and ludicr attitud got from under the professor
leg and left him stand with both feet on a separ stone like
the colossu of rhode
wretch anim cri my uncl suddenli transform into a foot
passengerand as angri and asham as a dismount cavalri offic on
the field of battl

well i cri quit delight with the inform so it is
why did you not sai so befor cri my uncl why not start at

ja repli han
my uncl frown stamp hi feet and then follow the hors to where
the boat lai
i thoroughli understood and appreci the necess for wait
befor cross the fjord for that moment when the sea at it highest
point is in a state of slack water as neither the ebb nor flow can then
be felt the ferri boat wa in no danger of be carri out to sea or
dash upon the rocki coast
the favor moment did not come until six oclock in the even then
my uncl myself and guid two boatmen and the four hors got into a
veri awkward flatbottom boat accustom as i had been to the steam
ferri boat of the elb i found the long oar of the boatmen but sorri
mean of locomot we were more than an hour in cross the fjord
but at length the passag wa conclud without accid
half an hour later we reach gardar
chapter 10
travel in iceland
it ought on would have thought to have been night even in the
sixtyfifth parallel of latitud but still the nocturn illumin
did not surpris me for in iceland dure the month of june and juli
the sun never set
the temperatur howev wa veri much lower than i expect i wa
cold but even that did not affect me so much as raven hunger
welcom inde therefor wa the hut which hospit open it door
to us
it wa mere the hous of a peasant but in the matter of hospit
it wa worthi of be the palac of a king as we alight at the door
the master of the hous came forward held out hi hand and without ani
further ceremoni signal to us to follow him
we follow him for to accompani him wa imposs a long narrow
gloomi passag led into the interior of thi habit made from beam
roughli squar by the ax thi passag gave ingress to everi room the
chamber were four in numberth kitchen the workshop where the
weav wa carri on the gener sleep chamber of the famili and
the best room to which stranger were especi invit my uncl
whose lofti statur had not been taken into consider when the hous
wa built contriv to knock hi head against the beam of the roof
we were introduc into our chamber a kind of larg room with a hard
earthen floor and light by a window the pane of which were made of
a sort of parchment from the intestin of sheepveri far from
transpar
the bed wa compos of dry hai thrown into two long red wooden
box ornament with sentenc paint in iceland i realli had no
idea that we should be made so comfort there wa on object to
the hous and that wa the veri power odor of dri fish of
macer meat and of sour milk which three fragranc combin did
not at all suit my olfactori nerv
as soon as we had freed ourselv from our heavi travel costum the
voic of our host wa heard call to us to come into the kitchen the
onli room in which the iceland ever make ani fire no matter how cold
it mai be
my uncl noth loath hasten to obei thi hospit and friendli
invit i follow
the kitchen chimnei wa made on an antiqu model a larg stone stand
in the middl of the room wa the fireplac abov in the roof wa a
hole for the smoke to pass through thi apart wa kitchen parlor
and dine room all in on
on our entranc our worthi host as if he had not seen us befor
advanc ceremoni utter a word which mean be happi and then
kiss both of us on the cheek
hi wife follow pronounc the same word with the same ceremoni
then the husband and wife place their right hand upon their heart
bow profoundli
thi excel iceland woman wa the mother of nineteen children who
littl and big roll crawl and walk about in the midst of
volum of smoke aris from the angular fireplac in the middl of the
room everi now and then i could see a fresh white head and a slightli
melancholi express of counten peer at me through the vapor
both my uncl and myself howev were veri friendli with the whole
parti and befor we were awar of it there were three or four of these
littl on on our shoulder as mani on our box and the rest hang
about our leg those who could speak kept cry out saellvertu in
everi possibl and imposs kei those who did not speak onli made all
the more nois
thi concert wa interrupt by the announc of supper at thi
moment our worthi guid the eiderduck hunter came in after see to
the feed and stabl of the horseswhich consist in let them
loos to brows on the stunt green of the iceland prairi there
wa littl for them to eat but moss and some veri dry and innutriti
grass next dai thei were readi befor the door some time befor we
were
welcom said han
then tranquilli with the air of an automaton without ani more
express in on kiss than anoth he embrac the host and hostess
and their nineteen children
thi ceremoni conclud to the satisfact of all parti we all sat
down to tabl that is twentyfour of us somewhat crowd those who
were best off had onli two juvenil on their knee
as soon howev as the inevit soup wa place on the tabl the
natur taciturn common even to iceland babi prevail over all
els our host fill our plate with a portion of lichen soup of
iceland moss of by no mean disagre flavor an enorm lump of
fish float in sour butter after that there came some skyr a kind of
curd and whei serv with biscuit and juniperberri juic to drink
we had blanda skim milk with water i wa hungri so hungri that by
wai of dessert i finish up with a basin of thick oaten porridg
as soon as the meal wa over the children disappear whilst the grown
peopl sat around the fireplac on which wa place turf heather cow
dung and dri fishbon as soon as everybodi wa suffici warm a
gener dispers took place all retir to their respect couch
our hostess offer to pull off our stock and trouser accord to
the custom of the countri but as we gracious declin to be so
honor she left us to our bed of dry fodder
next dai at five in the morn we took our leav of these hospit
peasant my uncl had great difficulti in make them accept a
suffici and proper remuner
han then gave the signal to start
we had scarc got a hundr yard from gardar when the charact of
the countri chang the soil began to be marshi and boggi and less
favor to progress to the right the rang of mountain wa
prolong indefinit like a great system of natur fortif of
which we skirt the glaci we met with numer stream and rivulet
which it wa necessari to ford and that without wet our baggag as
we advanc the desert appear increas and yet now and then we
could see human shadow flit in the distanc when a sudden turn of
the track brought us within easi reach of on of these specter i felt
a sudden impuls of disgust at the sight of a swollen head with shine
skin utterli without hair and whose repuls and revolt wound
could be seen through hi rag the unhappi wretch never came forward
to beg on the contrari thei ran awai not so quick howev but that
han wa abl to salut them with the univers saellvertu
spetelsk said he
a leper explain my uncl
the veri sound of such a word caus a feel of repuls the
horribl afflict known as leprosi which ha almost vanish befor
the effect of modern scienc is common in iceland it is not
contagi but hereditari so that marriag is strictli prohibit to
these unfortun creatur
these poor leper did not tend to enliven our journei the scene of
which wa inexpress sad and lone the veri last tuft of grassi
veget appear to die at our feet not a tree wa to be seen
except a few stunt willow about as big as blackberri bush now and
then we watch a falcon soar in the grei and misti air take hi
flight toward warmer and sunnier region i could not help feel a
sens of melancholi come over me i sigh for my own nativ land and
wish to be back with gretchen
we were compel to cross sever littl fjord and at last came to a
real gulf the tide wa at it height and we were abl to go over at
onc and reach the hamlet of alftan about a mile farther
that even after ford the alfa and the heta two river rich in
trout and pike we were compel to pass the night in a desert hous
worthi of be haunt by all the fai of scandinavian mytholog the
king of cold had taken up hi resid there and made us feel hi
presenc all night
the follow dai wa remark by it lack of ani particular
incid alwai the same damp and swampi soil the same dreari
uniform the same sad and monoton aspect of sceneri in the
even have accomplish the half of our project journei we slept
at the annexia of krosolbt
for a whole mile we had under our feet noth but lava thi
disposit of the soil is call ihrauni the crumbl lava on the
surfac wa in some instanc like ship cabl stretch out
horizont in other coil up in heap an immens field of lava
came from the neighbor mountain all extinct volcano but whose
remain show what onc thei had been here and there could be made out
the steam from hot water spring
there wa no time howev for us to take more than a cursori view of
these phenomena we had to go forward with what speed we might soon the
soft and swampi soil again appear under the feet of our hors while
at everi hundr yard we came upon on or more small lake our journei
wa now in a westerli direct we had in fact swept round the great
bai of faxa and the twin white summit of sneffel rose to the cloud
at a distanc of less than five mile
the hors now advanc rapidli the accid and difficulti of the
soil no longer check them i confess that fatigu began to tell
sever upon me but my uncl wa as firm and as hard as he had been on
the first dai i could not help admir both the excel professor
and the worthi guid for thei appear to regard thi rug expedit
as a mere walk
on saturdai the 20th june at six oclock in the even we reach
budir a small town picturesqu situat on the shore of the ocean
and here the guid ask for hi monei my uncl settl with him
immedi it wa now the famili of han himself that is to sai hi
uncl hi cousinsgerman who offer us hospit we were
exceedingli well receiv and without take too much advantag of the
good of these worthi peopl i should have like veri much to have
rest with them after the fatigu of the journei but my uncl who
did not requir rest had no idea of anyth of the kind and despit
the fact that next dai wa sundai i wa compel onc more to mount my
steed
the soil wa again affect by the neighborhood of the mountain whose
granit peer out of the ground like top of an old oak we were
skirt the enorm base of the mighti volcano my uncl never took
hi ey from off it he could not keep from gesticul and look
at it with a kind of sullen defianc as much as to sai that is the
giant i have made up my mind to conquer
after four hour of steadi travel the hors stop of themselv
befor the door of the presbyteri of stapi
chapter 11
we reach mount sneffelsth reykir
stapi is a town consist of thirti hut built on a larg plain of
lava expos to the rai of the sun reflect from the volcano it
stretch it humbl tenement along the end of a littl fjord
surround by a basalt wall of the most singular charact
basalt is a brown rock of igneou origin it assum regular form
which astonish by their singular appear here we found natur
proceed geometr and work quit after a human fashion as if
she had emploi the plummet line the compass and the rule if
elsewher she produc grand artist effect by pile up huge mass
without order or connectionif elsewher we see truncat cone
imperfect pyramid with an odd success of line here as if wish
to give a lesson in regular and preced the architect of the
earli ag she ha erect a sever order of architectur which
neither the splendor of babylon nor the marvel of greec ever
surpass
i had often heard of the giant causewai in ireland and of fingal
cave in on of the hebrid but the grand spectacl of a real basalt
format had never yet come befor my ey
thi at stapi gave us an idea of on in all it wonder beauti and
grace
the wall of the fjord like nearli the whole of the peninsula consist
of a seri of vertic column in height about thirti feet these
upright pillar of stone of the finest proport support an
archivault of horizont column which form a kind of halfvault
roof abov the sea at certain interv and below thi natur basin
the ey wa pleas and surpris by the sight of oval open through
which the outward wave came thunder in vollei of foam some bank
of basalt torn from their fasten by the furi of the wave lai
scatter on the ground like the ruin of an ancient templeruin
etern young over which the storm of ag swept without produc
ani percept effect
thi wa the last stage of our journei han had brought us along with
fidel and intellig and i began to feel somewhat more comfort
when i reflect that he wa to accompani us still farther on our wai
when we halt befor the hous of the rector a small and incommodi
cabin neither handsom nor more comfort than those of hi
neighbor i saw a man in the act of shoe a hors a hammer in hi
hand and a leathern apron ti round hi waist
be happi said the eiderdown hunter us hi nation salut in
hi own languag
god daggood dai repli the former in excel danish
kyrkoherd cri han turn round and introduc him to my uncl
the rector repeat the worthi professor it appear my dear harri
that thi worthi man is the rector and is not abov do hi own
work
dure the speak of these word the guid intim to the kyrkoherd
what wa the true state of the case the good man ceas from hi
occup gave a kind of halloo upon which a tall woman almost a
giantess came out of the hut she wa at least six feet high which in
that region is someth consider
my first impress wa on of horror i thought she had come to give us
the iceland kiss i had howev noth to fear for she did not
even show much inclin to receiv us into her hous
the room devot to stranger appear to me to be by far the worst in
the presbyteri it wa narrow dirti and offens there wa howev
no choic about the matter the rector had no notion of practic the
usual cordial and antiqu hospit far from it befor the dai wa
over i found we had to deal with a blacksmith a fisherman a hunter a
carpent anyth but a clergyman it must be said in hi favor that
we had caught him on a weekdai probabl he appear to greater
advantag on the sundai
these poor priest receiv from the danish govern a most
ridicul inadequ salari and collect on quarter of the tith of
their parishnot more than sixti mark current or about l3 10
sterl henc the necess of work to live in truth we soon
found that our host did not count civil among the cardin virtu
my uncl soon becam awar of the kind of man he had to deal with
instead of a worthi and learn scholar he found a dull illmann
peasant he therefor resolv to start on hi great expedit as soon
as possibl he did not care about fatigu and resolv to spend a few
dai in the mountain
the prepar for our departur were made the veri next dai after our
arriv at stapi han now hire three iceland to take the place of
the horseswhich could no longer carri our luggag when howev
these worthi island had reach the bottom of the crater thei were
to go back and leav us to ourselv thi point wa settl befor thei
would agre to start
on thi occas my uncl partli confid in han the eiderduck
hunter and gave him to understand that it wa hi intent to continu
hi explor of the volcano to the last possibl limit
han listen calmli and then nod hi head to go there or
elsewher to buri himself in the bowel of the earth or to travel over
it summit wa all the same to him as for me amus and occupi by
the incid of travel i had begun to forget the inevit futur
but now i wa onc more destin to realiz the actual state of affair
what wa to be done run awai but if i realli had intend to leav
professor hardwigg to hi fate it should have been at hamburg and not
at the foot of sneffel
on idea abov all other began to troubl me a veri terribl idea
and on calcul to shake the nerv of a man even less sensit than
myself
let us consid the matter i said to myself we ar go to ascend
the sneffel mountain well and good we ar about to pai a visit to the
veri bottom of the crater good still other have done it and did not
perish from that cours
that howev is not the whole matter to be consid if a road doe
realli present itself by which to descend into the dark and
subterran bowel of mother earth if thi thrice unhappi saknussemm
ha realli told the truth we shall be most certainli lost in the midst
of the labyrinth of subterran galleri of the volcano now we have
no evid to prove that sneffel is realli extinct what proof have we
that an erupt is not shortli about to take place becaus the monster
ha slept soundli sinc 1219 doe it follow that he is never to wake
if he doe wake what is to becom of us
these were question worth think about and upon them i reflect
long and deepli i could not lie down in search of sleep without
dream of erupt the more i thought the more i object to be
reduc to the state of dross and ash
i could stand it no longer so i determin at last to submit the whole
case to my uncl in the most adroit manner possibl and under the form
of some total irreconcil hypothesi
i sought him i laid befor him my fear and then drew back in order to
let him get hi passion over at hi eas
i have been think about the matter he said in the quietest tone
in the world
what did he mean wa he at last about to listen to the voic of reason
did he think of suspend hi project it wa almost too much
happi to be true
i howev made no remark in fact i wa onli too anxiou not to
interrupt him and allow him to reflect at hi leisur after some
moment he spoke out
i have been think about the matter he resum ever sinc we have
been at stapi my mind ha been almost sole occupi with the grave
question which ha been submit to me by yourselffor noth would
be unwis and more inconsist than to act with imprud
i heartili agre with you my dear uncl wa my somewhat hope
rejoind
it is now six hundr year sinc sneffel ha spoken but though now
reduc to a state of utter silenc he mai speak again new volcan
erupt ar alwai preced by perfectli wellknown phenomena i have
close examin the inhabit of thi region i have carefulli
studi the soil and i beg to tell you emphat my dear harri
there will be no erupt at present
as i listen to hi posit affirm i wa stupefi and could
sai noth
i see you doubt my word said my uncl follow me
i obei mechan
leav the presbyteri the professor took a road through an open in
the basalt rock which led far awai from the sea we were soon in open
countri if we could give such a name to a place all cover with
volcan deposit the whole land seem crush under the weight of
enorm stonesof trap of basalt of granit of lava and of all
other volcan substanc
i could see mani spout of steam rise in the air these white vapor
call in the iceland languag reykir come from hot water
fountain and indic by their violenc the volcan activ of the
soil now the sight of these appear to justifi my apprehens i wa
therefor all the more surpris and mortifi when my uncl thu
address me
you see all thi smoke harri my boi
ye sir
well as long as you see them thu you have noth to fear from the
volcano
how can that be
be care to rememb thi continu the professor at the approach
of an erupt these spout of vapor redoubl their activityto
disappear altogeth dure the period of volcan erupt for the
elast fluid no longer have the necessari tension seek refug in
the interior of the crater instead of escap through the fissur of
the earth if then the steam remain in it normal or habitu state
if their energi doe not increas and if you add to thi the remark
that the wind is not replac by heavi atmospher pressur and dead
calm you mai be quit sure that there is no fear of ani immedi
erupt
but
enough my boi when scienc ha sent forth her fiatit is onli to
hear and obei
i came back to the hous quit downcast and disappoint my uncl had
complet defeat me with hi scientif argument nevertheless i
had still on hope and that wa when onc we were at the bottom of the
crater that it would be imposs in default of a galleri or tunnel
to descend ani deeper and thi despit all the learn saknussemm in
the world
i pass the whole of the follow night with a nightmar on my chest
and after unheardof miseri and tortur found myself in the veri
depth of the earth from which i wa suddenli launch into planetari
space under the form of an erupt rock
next dai june 23d han calmli await us outsid the presbyteri with
hi three companion load with provis tool and instrument two
ironshod pole two gun and two larg game bag were reserv for my
uncl and myself han who wa a man who never forgot even the minutest
precaut had ad to our baggag a larg skin full of water as an
addit to our gourd thi assur us water for eight dai
it wa nine oclock in the morn when we were quit readi the rector
and hi huge wife or servant i never knew which stood at the door to
see us off thei appear to be about to inflict on us the usual final
kiss of the iceland to our suprem astonish their adieu took the
shape of a formid bill in which thei even count the us of the
pastor hous realli and truli the most abomin and dirti place i
ever wa in the worthi coupl cheat and rob us like a swiss
innkeep and made us feel by the sum we had to pai the splendor of
their hospit
my uncl howev paid without bargain a man who had made up hi
mind to undertak a voyag into the interior of the earth is not the
man to haggl over a few miser rixdollar
thi import matter settl han gave the signal for departur and
some few moment later we had left stapi
chapter 12
the ascent of mount sneffel
the huge volcano which wa the first stage of our dare experi is
abov five thousand feet high sneffel is the termin of a long
rang of volcan mountain of a differ charact to the system of
the island itself on of it peculiar is it two huge point
summit from whenc we start it wa imposs to make out the real
outlin of the peak against the grei field of sky all we could
distinguish wa a vast dome of white which fell downward from the head
of the giant
the commenc of the great undertak fill me with aw now that
we had actual start i began to believ in the realiti of the
undertak
our parti form quit a process we walk in singl file preced
by han the imperturb eiderduck hunter he calmli led us by narrow
path where two person could by no possibl walk abreast
convers wa wholli imposs we had all the more opportun to
reflect and admir the aw grandeur of the scene around
beyond the extraordinari basalt wall of the fjord of stapi we found
ourselv make our wai through fibrou turf over which grew a scanti
veget of grass the residuum of the ancient veget of the
swampi peninsula the vast mass of thi combust the field of which
as yet is utterli unexplor would suffic to warm iceland for a whole
centuri thi mighti turf pit measur from the bottom of certain
ravin is often not less than seventi feet deep and present to the
ey the view of success layer of black burnedup rocki detritu
separ by thin streak of porou sandston
the grandeur of the spectacl wa undoubt as well as it arid and
desert air
as a true nephew of the great professor hardwigg and despit my
preoccup and dole fear of what wa to come i observ with
great interest the vast collect of mineralog curios spread
out befor me in thi vast museum of natur histori look back to my
recent studi i went over in thought the whole geolog histori of
iceland
thi extraordinari and curiou island must have made it appear from
out of the great world of water at a compar recent date like
the coral island of the pacif it mai for aught we know be still
rise by slow and impercept degre
if thi realli be the case it origin can be attribut to onli on
causethat of the continu action of subterranean fire
thi wa a happi thought
if so if thi were true awai with the theori of sir humphri davi
awai with the author of the parchment of arn saknussemm the
wonder pretens to discoveri on the part of my uncleand to our
journei
all must end in smoke
charm with the idea i began more carefulli to look about me a
seriou studi of the soil wa necessari to neg or confirm my
hypothesi i took in everi item of what i saw and i began to
comprehend the success of phenomena which had preced it format
iceland be absolut without sedimentari soil is compos
exclus of volcan tufa that is to sai of an agglomer of
stone and of rock of a porou textur long befor the exist of
volcano it wa compos of a solid bodi of massiv trap rock lift
bodili and slowli out of the sea by the action of the centrifug forc
at work in the earth
the intern fire howev had not as yet burst their bound and
flood the exterior cake of mother earth with hot and rage lava
my reader must excus thi brief and somewhat pedant geolog
lectur but it is necessari to the complet understand of what
follow
at a later period in the world histori a huge and mighti fissur
must reason by analog have been dug diagon from the southwest
to the northeast of the island through which by degre flow the
volcan crust the great and wondrou phenomenon then went on without
violenceth outpour wa enorm and the seeth fuse matter
eject from the bowel of the earth spread slowli and peacefulli in
the form of vast level plain or what ar call mamelon or mound
it wa at thi epoch that the rock call feldspar syenit and
porphyri appear
but as a natur consequ of thi overflow the depth of the island
increas it can readili be believ what an enorm quantiti of
elast fluid were pile up within it centr when at last it afford
no other open after the process of cool the crust had taken
place
at length a time came when despit the enorm thick and weight of
the upper crust the mechan forc of the combust gase below
becam so great that thei actual upheav the weighti back and made
for themselv huge and gigant shaft henc the volcano which
suddenli aros through the upper crust and next the crater which
burst forth at the summit of these new creation
it will be seen that the first phenomena in connect with the
format of the island were simpli erupt to these howev shortli
succeed the volcan phenomena
through the newli form open escap the marvel mass of
basalt stone with which the plain we were now cross wa cover
we were trampl our wai over heavi rock of dark grei color which
while cool had been mould into sixsid prism in the back
distanc we could see a number of flatten cone which formerli were
so mani firevomit mouth
after the basalt erupt wa appeas and set at rest the volcano
the forc of which increas with that of the extinct crater gave free
passag to the fieri overflow of lava and to the mass of cinder and
pumic stone now scatter over the side of the mountain like
dishevel hair on the shoulder of a bacchant
here in a nutshel i had the whole histori of the phenomena from which
iceland aros all take their rise in the fierc action of interior
fire and to believ that the central mass did not remain in a state of
liquid fire white hot wa simpli and pure mad
thi be satisfactorili prove qed what insens folli to
pretend to penetr into the interior of the mighti earth
thi mental lectur deliv to myself while proceed on a journei
did me good i wa quit reassur as to the fate of our enterpris and
therefor went like a brave soldier mount a bristl batteri to
the assault of old sneffel
as we advanc the road becam everi moment more difficult the soil
wa broken and danger the rock broke and gave wai under our feet
and we had to be scrupul care in order to avoid danger and
constant fall
han advanc as calmli as if he had been walk over salisburi plain
sometim he would disappear behind huge block of stone and we
momentarili lost sight of him there wa a littl period of anxieti and
then there wa a shrill whistl just to tell us where to look for him
occasion he would take it into hi head to stop to pick up lump of
rock and silent pile them up into small heap in order that we might
not lose our wai on our return
he had no idea of the journei we were about to undertak
at all event the precaut wa a good on though how utterli useless
and unnecessarybut i must not anticip
three hour of terribl fatigu walk incessantli had onli brought
us to the foot of the great mountain thi will give some notion of what
we had still to undergo
suddenli howev han cri a haltthat is he made sign to that
effectand a summari kind of breakfast wa laid out on the lava befor
us my uncl who now wa simpli professor hardwigg wa so eager to
advanc that he bolt hi food like a greedi clown thi halt for
refresh wa also a halt for repos the professor wa therefor
compel to wait the good pleasur of hi imperturb guid who did
not give the signal for departur for a good hour
the three iceland who were as taciturn as their comrad did not sai
a word but went on eat and drink veri quietli and soberli
from thi our first real stage we began to ascend the slope of the
sneffel volcano it magnific snowi nightcap as we began to call
it by an optic delus veri common in mountain appear to me to
be close at hand and yet how mani long weari hour must elaps befor
we reach it summit what unheardof fatigu must we endur
the stone on the mountain side held togeth by no cement of soil
bound togeth by no root or creep herb gave wai continu under
our feet and went rush below into the plain like a seri of small
avalanch
in certain place the side of thi stupend mountain were at an angl
so steep that it wa imposs to climb upward and we were compel
to get round these obstacl as best we might
those who understand alpin climb will comprehend our difficulti
often we were oblig to help each other along by mean of our climb
pole
i must sai thi for my uncl that he stuck as close to me as possibl
he never lost sight of me and on mani occas hi arm suppli me
with firm and solid support he wa strong wiri and appar
insens to fatigu anoth great advantag with him wa that he had
the innat sentiment of equilibriumfor he never slip or fail in
hi step the iceland though heavili load climb with the
agil of mountain
look up everi now and then at the height of the great volcano of
sneffel it appear to me wholli imposs to reach to the summit on
that side at all event if the angl of inclin did not speedili
chang
fortun after an hour of unheardof fatigu and of gymnast
exercis that would have been try to an acrobat we came to a vast
field of ic which wholli surround the bottom of the cone of the
volcano the nativ call it the tablecloth probabl from some such
reason as the dweller in the cape of good hope call their mountain
tabl mountain and their road tabl bai
here to our mutual surpris we found an actual flight of stone step
which wonderfulli assist our ascent thi singular flight of stair
wa like everyth els volcan it had been form by on of those
torrent of stone cast up by the erupt and of which the iceland
name is stina if thi singular torrent had not been check in it
descent by the peculiar shape of the flank of the mountain it would
have swept into the sea and would have form new island
such as it wa it serv us admir the abrupt charact of the
slope momentarili increas but these remark stone step a littl
less difficult than those of the egyptian pyramid were the on simpl
natur mean by which we were enabl to proce
about seven in the even of that dai after have clamber up two
thousand of these rough step we found ourselv overlook a kind of
spur or project of the mountaina sort of buttress upon which the
conelik crater properli so call lean for support
the ocean lai beneath us at a depth of more than three thousand two
hundr feeta grand and mighti spectacl we had reach the region of
etern snow
the cold wa keen search and intens the wind blew with
extraordinari violenc i wa utterli exhaust
my worthi uncl the professor saw clearli that my leg refus further
servic and that in fact i wa utterli exhaust despit hi hot and
feverish impati he decid with a sigh upon a halt he call the
eiderduck hunter to hi side that worthi howev shook hi head
ofvanfor wa hi sole spoken repli
it appear sai my uncl with a woebegon look that we must go
higher
he then turn to han and ask him to give some reason for thi
decis respons
mistour repli the guid
ja mistoury the mistour cri on of the iceland guid in a
terrifi tone
it wa the first time he had spoken
what doe thi mysteri word signifi i anxious inquir
look said my uncl
i look down upon the plain below and i saw a vast a prodigi
volum of pulver pumic stone of sand of dust rise to the
heaven in the form of a mighti waterspout it resembl the fear
phenomenon of a similar charact known to the travel in the desert
of the great sahara
the wind wa drive it directli toward that side of sneffel on which
we were perch thi opaqu veil stand up between us and the sun
project a deep shadow on the flank of the mountain if thi sand
spout broke over us we must all be infal destroi crush in it
fear embrac thi extraordinari phenomenon veri common when the
wind shake the glacier and sweep over the arid plain is in the
iceland tongu call mistour
hastigt hastigt cri our guid
now i certainli knew noth of danish but i thoroughli understood that
hi gestur were meant to quicken us
the guid turn rapidli in a direct which would take us to the back
of the crater all the while ascend slightli
we follow rapidli despit our excess fatigu
a quarter of an hour later han paus to enabl us to look back the
mighti whirlwind of sand wa spread up the slope of the mountain to
the veri spot where we had propos to halt huge stone were caught up
cast into the air and thrown about as dure an erupt we were
happili a littl out of the direct of the wind and therefor out of
reach of danger but for the precaut and knowledg of our guid our
disloc bodi our crush and broken limb would have been cast to
the wind like dust from some unknown meteor
han howev did not think it prudent to pass the night on the bare
side of the cone we therefor continu our journei in a zigzag
direct the fifteen hundr feet which remain to be accomplish
took us at least five hour the turn and wind the
nothoroughfar the march and march turn that insignific
distanc into at least three leagu i never felt such miseri fatigu
and exhaust in my life i wa readi to faint from hunger and cold
the rarefi air at the same time painfulli act upon my lung
at last when i thought myself at my last gasp about eleven at night
it be in that region quit dark we reach the summit of mount
sneffel it wa in an aw mood of mind that despit my fatigu
befor i descend into the crater which wa to shelter us for the
night i paus to behold the sun rise at midnight on the veri dai of
it lowest declens and enjoi the spectacl of it ghastli pale
rai cast upon the isl which lai sleep at our feet
i no longer wonder at peopl travel all the wai from england to
norwai to behold thi magic and wondrou spectacl
chapter 13
the shadow of scartari
our supper wa eaten with eas and rapid after which everybodi did
the best he could for himself within the hollow of the crater the bed
wa hard the shelter unsatisfactori the situat painfulli in
the open air five thousand feet abov the level of the sea
nevertheless it ha seldom happen to me to sleep so well as i did on
that particular night i did not even dream so much for the effect of
what my uncl call wholesom fatigu
next dai when we awok under the rai of a bright and gloriou sun we
were nearli frozen by the keen air i left my granit couch and made on
of the parti to enjoi a view of the magnific spectacl which
develop itself panoramalik at our feet
i stood upon the lofti summit of mount sneffel southern peak thenc i
wa abl to obtain a view of the greater part of the island the optic
delus common to all lofti height rais the shore of the island
while the central portion appear depress it wa by no mean too
great a flight of fanci to believ that a giant pictur wa stretch
out befor me i could see the deep vallei that cross each other in
everi direct i could see precipic look like side of well
lake that seem to be chang into pond pond that look like
puddl and river that were transform into petti brook to my right
were glacier upon glacier and multipli peak top with light
cloud of smoke
the undul of these infinit number of mountain whose snowi
summit make them look as if cover by foam recal to my remembr
the surfac of a stormbeaten ocean if i look toward the west the
ocean lai befor me in all it majest grandeur a continu as it
were of these fleeci hilltop
where the earth end and the sea began it wa imposs for the ey to
distinguish
i soon felt that strang and mysteri sensat which is awaken in
the mind when look down from lofti hilltop and now i wa abl to do
so without ani feel of nervous have fortun harden
myself to that kind of sublim contempl
i wholli forgot who i wa and where i wa i becam intox with a
sens of lofti sublim without thought of the abyss into which my
dare wa soon about to plung me i wa present howev brought
back to the realiti of life by the arriv of the professor and han
who join me upon the lofti summit of the peak
my uncl turn in a westerli direct point out to me a light
cloud of vapor a kind of haze with a faint outlin of land rise out
of the water
greenland said he
greenland cri i in repli
ye continu my uncl who alwai when explain anyth spoke as
if he were in a professor chair we ar not more than thirtyf
leagu distant from that wonder land when the great annual breakup
of the ic take place white bear come over to iceland carri by the
float mass of ic from the north thi howev is a matter of
littl consequ we ar now on the summit of the great the
transcend sneffel and here ar it two peak north and south han
will tell you the name by which the peopl of iceland call that on which
we stand
my uncl turn to the imperturb guid who nod and spoke as
usualon word
scartari
my uncl look at me with a proud and triumphant glanc
a crater he said you hear
i did hear but i wa total unabl to make repli
the crater of mount sneffel repres an invert cone the gape
orific appar half a mile across the depth indefinit feet
conceiv what thi hole must have been like when full of flame and
thunder and lightn the bottom of the funnelshap hollow wa about
five hundr feet in circumfer by which it will be seen that the
slope from the summit to the bottom wa veri gradual and we were
therefor clearli abl to get there without much fatigu or difficulti
involuntarili i compar thi crater to an enorm load cannon and
the comparison complet terrifi me
to descend into the interior of a cannon i thought to myself when
perhap it is load and will go off at the least shock is the act of
a madman
but there wa no longer ani opportun for me to hesit han with a
perfectli calm and indiffer air took hi usual post at the head of
the adventur littl band i follow without utter a syllabl
i felt like the lamb led to the slaughter
in order to render the descent less difficult han took hi wai down
the interior of the cone in rather a zigzag fashion make as the
sailor sai long track to the eastward follow by equal long on
to the west it wa necessari to walk through the midst of erupt
rock some of which shaken in their balanc went roll down with
thunder clamor to the bottom of the abyss these continu fall
awok echo of singular power and effect
mani portion of the cone consist of inferior glacier han whenev
he met with on of these obstacl advanc with a great show of
precaut sound the soil with hi long iron pole in order to
discov fissur and layer of deep soft snow in mani doubt or
danger place it becam necessari for us to be ti togeth by a
long rope in order that should ani on of us be unfortun enough to
slip he would be support by hi companion thi connect link wa
doubtless a prudent precaut but not by ani mean unattend with
danger
nevertheless and despit all the manifold difficulti of the descent
along slope with which our guid wa wholli unacquaint we made
consider progress without accid on of our great parcel of rope
slip from on of the iceland porter and rush by a short cut to
the bottom of the abyss
by middai we were at the end of our journei i look upward and saw
onli the upper orific of the cone which serv as a circular frame to
a veri small portion of the skya portion which seem to me singularli
beauti should i ever again gaze on that love sunlit sky
the onli except to thi extraordinari landscap wa the peak of
scartari which seem lost in the great void of the heaven
the bottom of the crater wa compos of three separ shaft through
which dure period of erupt when sneffel wa in action the
great central furnac sent forth it burn lava and poison vapor
each of these chimnei or shaft gape openmouth in our path i kept
as far awai from them as possibl not even ventur to take the
faintest peep downward
as for the professor after a rapid examin of their disposit and
characterist he becam breathless and pant he ran from on to
the other like a delight schoolboi gesticul wildli and utter
incomprehens and disjoint phrase in all sort of languag
han the guid and hi humbler companion seat themselv on some
pile of lava and look silent on thei clearli took my uncl for a
lunat andwait the result
suddenli the professor utter a wild unearthli cry at first i
imagin he had lost hi foot and wa fall headlong into on of
the yawn gulf noth of the kind i saw him hi arm spread out
to their widest extent hi leg stretch apart stand upright
befor an enorm pedest high enough and black enough to bear a
gigant statu of pluto hi attitud and mien were that of a man
utterli stupefi but hi stupefact wa speedili chang to the
wildest joi
harri harri come here he cri make hastewonderfulwond
unabl to understand what he meant i turn to obei hi command
neither han nor the other iceland move a step
look said the professor in someth of the manner of the french
gener point out the pyramid to hi armi
and fulli partak hi stupefact if not hi joi i read on the
eastern side of the huge block of stone the same charact half eaten
awai by the corros action of time the name to me a thousand time
accurs
illustr runic glyph
arn saknussemm cri my uncl now unbeliev do you begin to
have faith
it wa total imposs for me to answer a singl word i went back to
my pile of lava in a state of silent aw the evid wa
unanswer overwhelm
in a few moment howev my thought were far awai back in my german
home with gretchen and the old cook what would i have given for on of
my cousin smile for on of the ancient domest omelett and for
my own feather bed
how long i remain in thi state i know not all i can sai is that
when at last i rais my head from between my hand there remain at
the bottom of the crater onli myself my uncl and han the iceland
porter had been dismiss and were now descend the exterior slope
of mount sneffel on their wai to stapi how heartili did i wish myself
with them
han slept tranquilli at the foot of a rock in a kind of rill of lava
where he had made himself a rough and readi bed my uncl wa walk
about the bottom of the crater like a wild beast in a cage i had no
desir neither had i the strength to move from my recumb posit
take exampl by the guid i gave wai to a kind of pain somnol
dure which i seem both to hear and feel continu heav and
shudder in the mountain
in thi wai we pass our first night in the interior of a crater
next morn a grei cloudi heavi sky hung like a funer pall over
the summit of the volcan cone i did not notic it so much from the
obscur that reign around us as from the rage with which my uncl
wa devour
i fulli understood the reason and again a glimps of hope made my heart
leap with joi i will briefli explain the caus
of the three open which yawn beneath our step onli on could
have been follow by the adventur saknussemm accord to the word
of the learn iceland it wa onli to be known by that on particular
mention in the cryptograph that the shadow of scartari fell upon it
just touch it mouth in the last dai of the month of june
we were in fact to consid the point peak as the stylu of an
immens sundial the shadow of which point on on given dai like the
inexor finger of fate to the yawn chasm which led into the
interior of the earth
now as often happen in these region should the sun fail to burst
through the cloud no shadow consequ no chanc of discov
the right apertur we had alreadi reach the 25th june if the kindli
heaven would onli remain dens cloud for six more dai we should
have to put off our voyag of discoveri for anoth year when certainli
there would be on person fewer in the parti i alreadi had suffici
of the mad and monstrou enterpris
it would be utterli imposs to depict the impot rage of professor
hardwigg the dai pass awai and not the faintest outlin of a shadow
could be seen at the bottom of the crater han the guid never move
from hi place he must have been curiou to know what we were about if
inde he could believ we were about anyth as for my uncl he
never address a word to me he wa nurs hi wrath to keep it warm
hi ey fix on the black and foggi atmospher hi complexion hideou
with suppress passion never had hi ey appear so fierc hi nose
so aquilin hi mouth so hard and firm
on the 26th no chang for the better a mixtur of rain and snow fell
dure the whole dai han veri quietli built himself a hut of lava into
which he retir like diogen into hi tub i took a malici delight
in watch the thousand littl cascad that flow down the side of
the cone carri with them at time a stream of stone into the vasti
deep below
my uncl wa almost frantic to be sure it wa enough to make even a
patient man angri he had reach to a certain extent the goal of hi
desir and yet he wa like to be wreck in port
but if the heaven and the element ar capabl of caus us much pain
and sorrow there ar two side to a medal and there wa reserv for
professor hardwigg a brilliant and sudden surpris which wa to
compens him for all hi suffer
next dai the sky wa still overcast but on sundai the 28th the last
dai but two of the month with a sudden chang of wind and a new moon
there came a chang of weather the sun pour it beam rai to the
veri bottom of the crater
each hillock everi rock everi stone everi asper of the soil had
it share of the lumin effulg and it shadow fell heavili on the
soil among other to hi insan delight the shadow of scartari wa
mark and clear and move slowli with the radiant start of dai
my uncl move with it in a state of mental ecstasi
at twelv oclock exactli when the sun had attain it highest
altitud for the dai the shadow fell upon the edg of the central pit
here it is gasp the professor in an agoni of joi here it isw
have found it forward my friend into the interior of the earth
i look curious at han to see what repli he would make to thi
terrif announc
forut said the guid tranquilli
forward it is answer my uncl who wa now in the seventh heaven of
delight
when we were quit readi our watch indic thirteen minut past
on
chapter 14
the real journei commenc
our real journei had now commenc hitherto our courag and
determin had overcom all difficulti we were fatigu at time
and that wa all now we were about to encount unknown and fear
danger
i had not as yet ventur to take a glimps down the horribl abyss into
which in a few minut more i wa about to plung the fatal moment had
howev at last arriv i had still the option of refus or
accept a share in thi foolish and audaci enterpris but i wa
asham to show more fear than the eiderduck hunter han seem to
accept the difficulti of the journei so tranquilli with such calm
indiffer with such perfect reckless of all danger that i
actual blush to appear less of a man than he
had i been alon with my uncl i should certainli have sat down and
argu the point fulli but in the presenc of the guid i held my
tongu i gave on moment to the thought of my charm cousin and then
i advanc to the mouth of the central shaft
it measur about a hundr feet in diamet which made about three
hundr in circumfer i lean over a rock which stood on it edg
and look down my hair stood on end my teeth chatter my limb
trembl i seem utterli to lose my centr of graviti while my head
wa in a sort of whirl like that of a drunken man there is noth
more power than thi attract toward an abyss i wa about to fall
headlong into the gape well when i wa drawn back by a firm and
power hand it wa that of han i had not taken lesson enough at
the frelserskirk of copenhagen in the art of look down from lofti
emin without blink
howev few as the minut were dure which i gaze down thi
tremend and even wondrou shaft i had a suffici glimps of it to
give me some idea of it physic conform it side which were
almost as perpendicular as those of a well present numer
project which doubtless would assist our descent
it wa a sort of wild and savag staircas without bannist or fenc
a rope fasten abov near the surfac would certainli support our
weight and enabl us to reach the bottom but how when we had arriv
at it utmost depth were we to loosen it abov thi wa i thought a
question of some import
my uncl howev wa on of those men who ar nearli alwai prepar
with expedi he hit upon a veri simpl method of obviat thi
difficulti he unrol a cord about as thick as my thumb and at least
four hundr feet in length he allow about half of it to go down the
pit and catch in a hitch over a great block of lava which stood on the
edg of the precipic thi done he threw the second half after the
first
each of us could now descend by catch the two cord in on hand when
about two hundr feet below all the explor had to do wa to let go
on end and pull awai at the other when the cord would come fall at
hi feet in order to go down farther all that wa necessari wa to
continu the same oper
thi wa a veri excel proposit and no doubt a correct on
go down appear to me easi enough it wa the come up again that
now occupi my thought
now said my uncl as soon as he had complet thi import
prepar let us see about the baggag it must be divid into
three separ parcel and each of us must carri on on hi back i
allud to the more import and fragil articl
my worthi and ingeni uncl did not appear to consid that we came
under the denomin
han he continu you will take charg of the tool and some of the
provis you harri must take possess of anoth third of the
provis and of the arm i will load myself with the rest of the
eatabl and with the more delic instrument
but i exclaim our cloth thi mass of cord and ladderswho
will undertak to carri them down
thei will go down of themselv
and how so i ask
you shall see
my uncl wa not fond of half measur nor did he like anyth in the
wai of hesit give hi order to han he had the whole of the
nonfragil articl made up into on bundl and the packet firmli and
solidli fasten wa simpli pitch over the edg of the gulf
i heard the moan of the suddenli displac air and the nois of
fall stone my uncl lean over the abyss follow the descent of
hi luggag with a perfectli selfsatisfi air and did not rise until
it had complet disappear from sight
now then he cri it is our turn
i put it in good faith to ani man of common sensewa it possibl to
hear thi energet cry without a shudder
the professor fasten hi case of instrument on hi back han took
charg of the tool i of the arm the descent then commenc in the
follow order han went first my uncl follow and i went last
our progress wa made in profound silencea silenc onli troubl by
the fall of piec of rock which break from the jag side fell
with a roar into the depth below
i allow myself to slide so to speak hold frantic on the
doubl cord with on hand and with the other keep myself off the
rock by the assist of my ironshod pole on idea wa all the time
impress upon my brain i fear that the upper support would fail me
the cord appear to me far too fragil to bear the weight of three such
person as we were with our luggag i made as littl us of it as
possibl trust to my own agil and do miracl in the wai of
feat of dexter and strength upon the project shelv and spur of
lava which my feet seem to clutch as strongli as my hand
the guid went first i have said and when on of the slipperi and
frail support broke from under hi feet he had recours to hi usual
monosyllab wai of speak
gif akt
attentionlook out repeat my uncl
in about half an hour we reach a kind of small terrac form by a
fragment of rock project some distanc from the side of the shaft
han now began to haul upon the cord on on side onli the other go
as quietli upward as the other came down it fell at last bring with
it a shower of small stone lava and dust a disagre kind of rain
or hail
while we were seat on thi extraordinari bench i ventur onc more to
look downward with a sigh i discov that the bottom wa still
wholli invis were we then go direct to the interior of the
earth
the perform with the cord recommenc and a quarter of an hour
later we had reach to the depth of anoth two hundr feet
i have veri strong doubt if the most determin geologist would dure
that descent have studi the natur of the differ layer of earth
around him i did not troubl my head much about the matter whether we
were among the combust carbon silurian or primit soil i
neither knew nor care to know
not so the inveter professor he must have taken note all the wai
down for at on of our halt he began a brief lectur
the farther we advanc said he the greater is my confid in the
result the disposit of these volcan strata absolut confirm the
theori of sir humphri davi we ar still within the region of the
primordi soil the soil in which took place the chemic oper of
metal becom inflam by come in contact with the air and water i
at onc regret the old and now forev explod theori of a central
fire at all event we shall soon know the truth
such wa the everlast conclus to which he came i howev wa
veri far from be in humor to discuss the matter i had someth els
to think of my silenc wa taken for consent and still we continu to
go down
at the expir of three hour we were to all appear as far off
as ever from the bottom of the well when i look upward howev i
could see that the upper orific wa everi minut decreas in size
the side of the shaft were get closer and closer togeth we were
approach the region of etern night
and still we continu to descend
at length i notic that when piec of stone were detach from the
side of thi stupend precipic thei were swallow up with less
nois than befor the final sound wa sooner heard we were approach
the bottom of the abyss
as i had been veri care to keep account of all the chang of cord
which took place i wa abl to tell exactli what wa the depth we had
reach as well as the time it had taken
we had shift the rope twentyeight time each oper take a
quarter of an hour which in all made seven hour to thi had to be
ad twentyeight paus in all ten hour and a half we start at
on it wa now therefor about eleven oclock at night
it doe not requir great knowledg of arithmet to know that
twentyeight time two hundr feet make five thousand six hundr feet
in all more than an english mile
while i wa make thi mental calcul a voic broke the silenc it
wa the voic of han
halt he cri
i check myself veri suddenli just at the moment when i wa about to
kick my uncl on the head
we have reach the end of our journei said the worthi professor in a
satisfi tone
what the interior of the earth said i slip down to hi side
no you stupid fellow but we have reach the bottom of the well
and i suppos there is no farther progress to be made i hopefulli
exclaim
oh ye i can dimli see a sort of tunnel which turn off obliqu to
the right at all event we must see about that tomorrow let us sup
now and seek slumber as best we mai
i thought it time but made no observ on that point i wa fairli
launch on a desper cours and all i had to do wa to go forward
hopefulli and trustingli
it wa not even now quit dark the light filter down in a most
extraordinari manner
we open the provis bag at a frugal supper and each did hi best
to find a bed amid the pile of stone dirt and lava which had
accumul for ag at the bottom of the shaft
i happen to grope out the pile of rope ladder and cloth which we
had thrown down and upon them i stretch myself after such a dai
labor my rough bed seem as soft as down
for a while i lai in a sort of pleasant tranc
present after ly quietli for some minut i open my ey and
look upward as i did so i made out a brilliant littl dot at the
extrem of thi long gigant telescop
it wa a star without scintil rai accord to my calcul
it must be beta in the constel of the littl bear
after thi littl bit of astronom recreat i drop into a sound
sleep
chapter 15
we continu our descent
at eight oclock the next morn a faint kind of dawn of dai awok us
the thousand and on prism of the lava collect the light as it pass
and brought it to us like a shower of spark
we were abl with eas to see object around us
well harri my boi cri the delight professor rub hi hand
togeth what sai you now did you ever pass a more tranquil night in
our hous in the konigstrass no deafen sound of cart wheel no
cri of hawker no bad languag from boatmen or watermen
well uncl we ar quit at the bottom of thi wellbut to me there
is someth terribl in thi calm
why said the professor hotli on would sai you were alreadi
begin to be afraid how will you get on present do you know that
as yet we have not penetr on inch into the bowel of the earth
what can you mean sir wa my bewild and astonish repli
i mean to sai that we have onli just reach the soil of the island
itself thi long vertic tube which end at the bottom of the crater
of sneffel ceas here just about on a level with the sea
ar you sure sir
quit sure consult the baromet
it wa quit true that the mercuri after rise gradual in the
instrument as long as our descent wa take place had stop
precis at twentynin degre
you perceiv said the professor we have as yet onli to endur the
pressur of air i am curiou to replac the baromet by the
manomet
the baromet in fact wa about to becom uselessa soon as the
weight of the air wa greater than what wa calcul as abov the
level of the ocean
but said i is it not veri much to be fear that thi
everincreas pressur mai not in the end turn out veri pain and
inconveni
no said he we shall descend veri slowli and our lung will be
gradual accustom to breath compress air it is well known that
aeronaut have gone so high as to be nearli without air at allwhi
then should we not accustom ourselv to breath when we have sai a
littl too much of it for myself i am certain i shall prefer it let
us not lose a moment where is the packet which preced us in our
descent
i smilingli point it out to my uncl han had not seen it and
believ it caught somewher abov us hupp as he phrase it
now said my uncl let us breakfast and break fast like peopl who
have a long dai work befor them
biscuit and dri meat wash down by some mouth of water flavor
with schiedam wa the materi of our luxuri meal
as soon as it wa finish my uncl took from hi pocket a notebook
destin to be fill by memoranda of our travel he had alreadi place
hi instrument in order and thi is what he wrote
mondai june 29th
chronomet 8h 17m morn
baromet 296 inch
thermomet 6 degre 43 degre fahr
direct es
thi last observ refer to the obscur galleri and wa indic
to us by the compass
now harri cri the professor in an enthusiast tone of voic we
ar truli about to take our first step into the interior of the earth
never befor visit by man sinc the first creation of the world you
mai consid therefor that at thi precis moment our travel realli
commenc
as my uncl made thi remark he took in on hand the ruhmkorff coil
apparatu which hung round hi neck and with the other he put the
electr current into commun with the worm of the lantern and a
bright light at onc illumin that dark and gloomi tunnel
the effect wa magic
han who carri the second apparatu had it also put into oper
thi ingeni applic of electr to practic purpos enabl
us to move along by the light of an artifici dai amid even the flow
of the most inflamm and combust gase
forward cri my uncl each took up hi burden han went first my
uncl follow and i go third we enter the somber galleri
just as we were about to engulf ourselv in thi dismal passag i
lift up my head and through the tubelik shaft saw that iceland sky i
wa never to see again
wa it the last i should ever see of ani sky
the stream of lava flow from the bowel of the earth in 1219 had
forc itself a passag through the tunnel it line the whole of the
insid with it thick and brilliant coat the electr light ad
veri greatli to the brillianc of the effect
the great difficulti of our journei now began how were we to prevent
ourselv from slip down the steepli inclin plane happili some
crack abrasur of the soil and other irregular serv the
place of step and we descend slowli allow our heavi luggag to
slip on befor at the end of a long cord
but that which serv as step under our feet becam in other place
stalactit the lava veri porou in certain place took the form of
littl round blister crystal of opaqu quartz adorn with limpid
drop of natur glass suspend to the roof like luster seem to
take fire as we pass beneath them on would have fanci that the
genii of romanc were illumin their underground palac to receiv
the son of men
magnific gloriou i cri in a moment of involuntari enthusiasm
what a spectacl uncl do you not admir these varieg shade of
lava which run through a whole seri of color from reddish brown to
pale yellowbi the most insens degre and these crystal thei
appear like lumin globe
you ar begin to see the charm of travel master harri cri my
uncl wait a bit until we advanc farther what we have as yet
discov is nothingonward my boi onward
it would have been a far more correct and appropri express had he
said let us slide for we were go down an inclin plane with
perfect eas the compass indic that we were move in a
southeasterli direct the flow of lava had never turn to the right
or the left it had the inflex of a straight line
nevertheless to my surpris we found no percept increas in heat
thi prove the theori of humphri davi to be found on truth and
more than onc i found myself examin the thermomet in silent
astonish
two hour after our departur it onli mark fiftyfour degre
fahrenheit i had everi reason to believ from thi that our descent wa
far more horizont than vertic as for discov the exact depth to
which we had attain noth could be easier the professor as he
advanc measur the angl of deviat and inclin but he kept
the result of hi observ to himself
about eight oclock in the even my uncl gave the signal for
halt han seat himself on the ground the lamp were hung to
fissur in the lava rock we were now in a larg cavern where air wa
not want on the contrari it abound what could be the caus of
thisto what atmospher agit could be ascrib thi draught but
thi wa a question which i did not care to discuss just then fatigu
and hunger made me incap of reason an unceas march of seven
hour had not been kept up without great exhaust i wa realli and
truli worn out and delight enough i wa to hear the word halt
han laid out some provis on a lump of lava and we each sup with
keen relish on thing howev caus us great uneasinessour water
reserv wa alreadi half exhaust my uncl had full confid in
find subterranean resourc but hitherto we had complet fail in
so do i could not help call my uncl attent to the
circumst
and you ar surpris at thi total absenc of spring he said
doubtlessi am veri uneasi on the point we have certainli not enough
water to last us five dai
be quit easi on that matter continu my uncl i answer for it we
shall find plenti of waterin fact far more than we shall want
but when
when we onc get through thi crust of lava how can you expect spring
to forc their wai through these solid stone wall
but what is there to prove that thi concret mass of lava doe not
extend to the centr of the earth i dont think we have as yet done
much in a vertic wai
what put that into your head my boi ask my uncl mildli
well it appear to me that if we had descend veri far below the
level of the seaw should find it rather hotter than we have
accord to your system said my uncl but what doe the
thermomet sai
scarc fifteen degre by reaumur which is onli an increas of nine
sinc our departur
well and what conclus doe that bring you to inquir the
professor
the deduct i draw from thi is veri simpl accord to the most
exact observ the augment of the temperatur of the interior
of the earth is on degre for everi hundr feet but certain local
caus mai consider modifi thi figur thu at yakoust in siberia
it ha been remark that the heat increas a degre everi thirtysix
feet the differ evid depend on the conduct of certain
rock in the neighborhood of an extinct volcano it ha been remark
that the elev of temperatur wa onli on degre in everi
fiveandtwenti feet let us then go upon thi calculationwhich is
the most favorableand calcul
calcul awai my boi
noth easier said i pull out my notebook and pencil nine
time on hundr and twentyf feet make a depth of eleven hundr
and twentyf feet
archimed could not have spoken more geometr
well
well accord to my observ we ar at least ten thousand feet
below the level of the sea
can it be possibl
either my calcul is correct or there is no truth in figur
the calcul of the professor were perfectli correct we were
alreadi six thousand feet deeper down in the bowel of the earth than
anyon had ever been befor the lowest known depth to which man had
hitherto penetr wa in the mine of kitzbuhel in the tirol and
those of wurttemberg
the temperatur which should have been eightyon wa in thi place
onli fifteen thi wa a matter for seriou consider
chapter 16
the eastern tunnel
the next dai wa tuesdai the 30th of juneand at six oclock in the
morn we resum our journei
we still continu to follow the galleri of lava a perfect natur
pathwai as easi of descent as some of those inclin plane which in
veri old german hous serv the purpos of staircas thi went on
until seventeen minut past twelv the precis instant at which we
rejoin han who have been somewhat in advanc had suddenli
stop
at last cri my uncl we have reach the end of the shaft
i look wonderingli about me we were in the centr of four cross
pathssomb and narrow tunnel the question now aros as to which it
wa wise to take and thi of itself wa no small difficulti
my uncl who did not wish to appear to have ani hesit about the
matter befor myself or the guid at onc made up hi mind he point
quietli to the eastern tunnel and without delai we enter within it
gloomi recess
besid had he entertain ani feel of hesit it might have been
prolong indefinit for there wa no indic by which to
determin on a choic it wa absolut necessari to trust to chanc
and good fortun
the descent of thi obscur and narrow galleri wa veri gradual and
wind sometim we gaze through a success of arch it cours
veri like the aisl of a gothic cathedr the great artist sculptor
and builder of the middl ag might have here complet their studi
with advantag mani most beauti and suggest idea of
architectur beauti would have been discov by them after pass
through thi phase of the cavern wai we suddenli came about a mile
farther on upon a squar system of arch adopt by the earli roman
project from the solid rock and keep up the weight of the roof
suddenli we would come upon a seri of low subterranean tunnel which
look like beaver hole or the work of foxesthrough whose narrow and
wind wai we had liter to crawl
the heat still remain at quit a support degre with an
involuntari shudder i reflect on what the heat must have been when
the volcano of sneffel wa pour it smoke flame and stream of
boil lavaal of which must have come up by the road we were now
follow i could imagin the torrent of hot seeth stone dart
on bubbl up with accompani of smoke steam and sulphur
stench
onli to think of the consequ i muse if the old volcano were
onc more to set to work
i did not commun these rather unpleas reflect to my uncl
he not onli would not have understood them but would have been
intens disgust hi onli idea wa to go ahead he walk he slid
he clamber over pile of fragment he roll down heap of broken
lava with an earnest and convict it wa imposs not to
admir
at six oclock in the even after a veri wearisom journei but on
not so fatigu as befor we had made six mile toward the southward
but had not gone more than a mile downward
my uncl as usual gave the signal to halt we at our meal in
thought silenc and then retir to sleep
our arrang for the night were veri primit and simpl a
travel rug in which each roll himself wa all our bed we had
no necess to fear cold or ani unpleas visit travel who buri
themselv in the wild and depth of the african desert who seek
profit and pleasur in the forest of the new world ar compel to
take it in turn to watch dure the hour of sleep but in thi region
of the earth absolut solitud and complet secur reign suprem
we had noth to fear either from savag or from wild beast
after a night sweet repos we awok fresh and readi for action there
be noth to detain us we start on our journei we continu to
burrow through the lava tunnel as befor it wa imposs to make out
through what soil we were make wai the tunnel moreov instead of
go down into the bowel of the earth becam absolut horizont
i even thought after some examin that we were actual tend
upward about ten oclock in the dai thi state of thing becam so
clear that find the chang veri fatigu i wa oblig to slacken
my pace and final come to a halt
well said the professor quickli what is the matter
the fact is i am dreadfulli tire wa my earnest repli
what cri my uncl tire after a three hour walk and by so easi
a road
easi enough i dare sai but veri fatigu
but how can that be when all we have to do is to go downward
i beg your pardon sir for some time i have notic that we ar go
upward
upward cri my uncl shrug hi shoulder how can that be
there can be no doubt about it for the last half hour the slope have
been upwardand if we go on in thi wai much longer we shall find
ourselv back in iceland
my uncl shook hi head with the air of a man who doe not want to be
convinc i tri to continu the convers he would not answer me
but onc more gave the signal for departur hi silenc i thought wa
onli caus by concentr illtemp
howev thi might be i onc more took up my load and boldli and
resolut follow han who wa now in advanc of my uncl i did not
like to be beaten or even distanc i wa natur anxiou not to lose
sight of my companion the veri idea of be left behind lost in that
terribl labyrinth made me shiver as with the agu
besid if the ascend path wa more arduou and pain to clamber
i had on sourc of secret consol and delight it wa to all
appear take us back to the surfac of the earth that of itself
wa hope everi step i took confirm me in my belief and i began
alreadi to build castl in the air in relat to my marriag with my
pretti littl cousin
about twelv oclock there wa a great and sudden chang in the aspect
of the rocki side of the galleri i first notic it from the
diminut of the rai of light which cast back the reflect of the
lamp from be coat with shine and resplend lava it becam
live rock the side were slope wall which sometim becam quit
vertic
we were now in what the geolog professor call a state of
transit in the period of silurian stone so call becaus thi
specimen of earli format is veri common in england in the counti
formerli inhabit by the celtic nation known as silur
i can see clearli now i cri the sediment from the water which
onc cover the whole earth form dure the second period of it
exist these schist and these calcar rock we ar turn our
back on the granit rock and ar like peopl from hamburg who would
go to lubeck by wai of hanov
i might just as well have kept my observ to myself my geolog
enthusiasm got the better howev of my cooler judgment and professor
hardwigg heard my observ
what is the matter now he said in a tone of great graviti
well cri i do you not see these differ layer of calcar
rock and the first indic of slate strata
well what then
we have arriv at that period of the world exist when the first
plant and the first anim made their appear
you think so
ye look examin and judg for yourself
i induc the professor with some difficulti to cast the light of hi
lamp on the side of the long wind galleri i expect some
exclam to burst from hi lip i wa veri much mistaken the worthi
professor never spoke a word
it wa imposs to sai whether he understood me or not perhap it wa
possibl that in hi pridemi uncl and a learn professorh did not
like to own that he wa wrong in have chosen the eastern tunnel or
wa he determin at ani price to go to the end of it it wa quit
evid we had left the region of lava and that the road by which we
were go could not take us back to the great crater of mount sneffel
as we went along i could not help rumin on the whole question and
ask myself if i did not lai too great a stress on these sudden and
peculiar modif of the earth crust
after all i wa veri like to be mistakenand it wa within the rang
of probabl and possibl that we were not make our wai through
the strata of rock which i believ i recogn pile on the lower
layer of granit format
at all event if i am right i thought to myself i must certainli
find some remain of primit plant and it will be absolut
necessari to give wai to such indubit evid let us have a good
search
i accordingli lost no opportun of search and had not gone more
than about a hundr yard when the evid i sought for crop up in
the most incontest manner befor my ey it wa quit natur that
i should expect to find these sign for dure the silurian period the
sea contain no fewer than fifteen hundr differ anim and
veget speci my feet so long accustom to the hard and arid lava
soil suddenli found themselv tread on a kind of soft dust the
remain of plant and shell
upon the wall themselv i could clearli make out the outlin as plain
as a sun pictur of the fucu and the lycopod the worthi and
excel professor hardwigg could not of cours make ani mistak about
the matter but i believ he deliber close hi ey and continu
on hi wai with a firm and unalter step
i began to think that he wa carri hi obstinaci a great deal too
far i could no longer act with prudenc or composur i stoop on a
sudden and pick up an almost perfect shell which had undoubtedli
belong to some anim veri much resembl some of the present dai
have secur the prize i follow in the wake of my uncl
do you see thi i said
well said the professor with the most imperturb tranquil it
is the shell of a crustac anim of the extinct order of the
trilobit noth more i assur you
but cri i much troubl at hi cool do you draw no
conclus from it
well if i mai ask what conclus do you draw from it yourself
well i thought
i know my boi what you would sai and you ar right perfectli and
incontest right we have final abandon the crust of lava and the
road by which the lava ascend it is quit possibl that i mai have
been mistaken but i shall be unabl to discov my error until i get to
the end of thi galleri
you ar quit right as far as that is concern i repli and i
should highli approv of your decis if we had not to fear the
greatest of all danger
and what is that
want of water
well my dear henri it cant be help we must put ourselv on
ration
and on he went
chapter 17
deeper and deeperth coal mine
in truth we were compel to put ourselv upon ration our suppli
would certainli last not more than three dai i found thi out about
supper time the worst part of the matter wa that in what is call
the transit rock it wa hardli to be expect we should meet with
water
i had read of the horror of thirst and i knew that where we were a
brief trial of it suffer would put an end to our adventuresand
our live but it wa utterli useless to discuss the matter with my
uncl he would have answer by some axiom from plato
dure the whole of next dai we proceed on our journei through thi
intermin galleri arch after arch tunnel after tunnel we journei
without exchang a word we had becom as mute and retic as han
our guid
the road had no longer an upward tendenc at all event if it had it
wa not to be made out veri clearli sometim there could be no doubt
that we were go downward but thi inclin wa scarc to be
distinguish and wa by no mean reassur to the professor becaus
the charact of the strata wa in no wise modifi and the transit
charact of the rock becam more and more mark
it wa a gloriou sight to see how the electr light brought out the
sparkl in the wall of the calcar rock and the old red
sandston on might have fanci oneself in on of those deep cut
in devonshir which have given their name to thi kind of soil some
magnific specimen of marbl project from the side of the galleri
some of an agat grei with white vein of varieg charact other
of a yellow spot color with red vein farther off might be seen
sampl of color in which cherrytint seam were to be found in all
their brightest shade
the greater number of these marbl were stamp with the mark of
primit anim sinc the previou even natur and creation had
made consider progress instead of the rudimentari trilobit i
perceiv the remain of a more perfect order among other the fish in
which the ey of a geologist ha been abl to discov the first form of
the reptil
the devonian sea were inhabit by a vast number of anim of thi
speci which were deposit in ten of thousand in the rock of new
format
it wa quit evid to me that we were ascend the scale of anim
life of which man form the summit my excel uncl the professor
appear not to take notic of these warn he wa determin at ani
risk to proce
he must have been in expect of on of two thing either that a
vertic well wa about to open under hi feet and thu allow him to
continu hi descent or that some insurmount obstacl would compel
us to stop and go back by the road we had so long travel but even
came again and to my horror neither hope wa doom to be realiz
on fridai after a night when i began to feel the gnaw agoni of
thirst and when in consequ appetit decreas our littl band rose
and onc more follow the turn and wind the ascent and
descent of thi intermin galleri all were silent and gloomi i
could see that even my uncl had ventur too far
after about ten hour of further progressa progress dull and
monoton to the last degreei remark that the reverber and
reflect of our lamp upon the side of the tunnel had singularli
diminish the marbl the schist the calcar rock the red
sandston had disappear leav in their place a dark and gloomi
wall somber and without bright when we reach a remark narrow
part of the tunnel i lean my left hand against the rock
when i took my hand awai and happen to glanc at it it wa quit
black we had reach the coal strata of the central earth
a coal mine i cri
a coal mine without miner respond my uncl a littl sever
how can we tell
i can tell repli my uncl in a sharp and doctori tone i am
perfectli certain that thi galleri through success layer of coal
wa not cut by the hand of man but whether it is the work of natur or
not is of littl concern to us the hour for our even meal ha
comelet us sup
han the guid occupi himself in prepar food i had come to that
point when i could no longer eat all i care about were the few drop
of water which fell to my share what i suffer it is useless to
record the guid gourd not quit half full wa all that wa left
for us three
have finish their repast my two companion laid themselv down
upon their rug and found in sleep a remedi for their fatigu and
suffer as for me i could not sleep i lai count the hour until
morn
the next morn saturdai at six oclock we start again twenti
minut later we suddenli came upon a vast excav from it mighti
extent i saw at onc that the hand of man could have had noth to do
with thi coal mine the vault abov would have fallen in as it wa it
wa onli held togeth by some miracl of natur
thi mighti natur cavern wa about a hundr feet wide by about a
hundr and fifti high the earth had evid been cast apart by some
violent subterranean commot the mass give wai to some prodigi
upheav of natur had split in two leav the vast gap into which
we inhabit of the earth had penetr for the first time
the whole singular histori of the coal period wa written on those dark
and gloomi wall a geologist would have been abl easili to follow the
differ phase of it format the seam of coal were separ by
strata of sandston a compact clai which appear to be crush down
by the weight from abov
at that period of the world which preced the secondari epoch the
earth wa cover by a coat of enorm and rich veget due to
the doubl action of tropic heat and perpetu humid a vast
atmospher cloud of vapor surround the earth on all side prevent
the rai of the sun from ever reach it
henc the conclus that these intens heat did not aris from thi
new sourc of calor
perhap even the star of dai wa not quit readi for it brilliant
workto illumin a univers climat did not as yet exist and a level
heat pervad the whole surfac of the globeth same heat exist at
the north pole as at the equat
whenc did it come from the interior of the earth
in spite of all the learn theori of professor hardwigg a fierc and
vehement fire certainli burn within the entrail of the great
spheroid it action wa felt even to the veri topmost crust of the
earth the plant then in exist be depriv of the vivifi
rai of the sun had neither bud nor flower nor odor but their
root drew a strong and vigor life from the burn earth of earli
dai
there were but few of what mai be call treesonli herbac plant
immens turf brier moss rare famili which howev in those
dai were count by ten and ten of thousand
it is entir to thi exuber veget that coal ow it origin
the crust of the vast globe still yield under the influenc of the
seeth boil mass which wa forev at work beneath henc aros
numer fissur and continu fall in of the upper earth the
dens mass of plant be beneath the water soon form themselv
into vast agglomer
then came about the action of natur chemistri in the depth of the
ocean the veget mass at first becam turf then thank to the
influenc of gase and subterranean ferment thei underw the
complet process of miner
in thi manner in earli dai were form those vast and prodigi
layer of coal which an everincreas consumpt must utterli us
up in about three centuri more if peopl do not find some more
econom light than ga and some cheaper motiv power than steam
all these reflect the memori of my school studi came to my
mind while i gaze upon these mighti accumul of coal whose
rich howev ar scarc like to be ever util the work of
these mine could onli be carri out at an expens that would never
yield a profit
the matter howev is scarc worthi consider when coal is
scatter over the whole surfac of the globe within a few yard of the
upper crust as i look at these untouch strata therefor i knew
thei would remain as long as the world last
while we still continu our journei i alon forgot the length of the
road by give myself up wholli to these geolog consider the
temperatur continu to be veri much the same as while we were
travel amid the lava and the schist on the other hand my sens of
smell wa much affect by a veri power odor i immedi knew that
the galleri wa fill to overflow with that danger ga the miner
call fire damp the explos of which ha caus such fear and
terribl accid make a hundr widow and hundr of orphan in a
singl hour
happili we were abl to illumin our progress by mean of the ruhmkorff
apparatu if we had been so rash and imprud as to explor thi
galleri torch in hand a terribl explos would have put an end to
our travel simpli becaus no travel would be left
our excurs through thi wondrou coal mine in the veri bowel of the
earth last until even my uncl wa scarc abl to conceal hi
impati and dissatisfact at the road continu still to advanc
in a horizont direct
the dark dens and opaqu a few yard in advanc and in the rear
render it imposs to make out what wa the length of the galleri
for myself i began to believ that it wa simpli intermin and
would go on in the same manner for month
suddenli at six oclock we stood in front of a wall to the right to
the left abov below nowher wa there ani passag we had reach a
spot where the rock said in unmistak accentsno thoroughfar
i stood stupefi the guid simpli fold hi arm my uncl wa
silent
well well so much the better cri my uncl at last i now know
what we ar about we ar decidedli not upon the road follow by
saknussemm all we have to do is to go back let us take on night
good rest and befor three dai ar over i promis you we shall have
regain the point where the galleri divid
ye we mai if our strength last as long i cri in a lament
voic
and why not
tomorrow among us three there will not be a drop of water it is just
gone
and your courag with it said my uncl speak in a sever tone
what could i sai i turn round on my side and from sheer exhaust
fell into a heavi sleep disturb by dream of water and i awok
unrefresh
i would have barter a diamond mine for a glass of pure spring water
chapter 18
the wrong road
next dai our departur took place at a veri earli hour there wa no
time for the least delai accord to my account we had five dai
hard work to get back to the place where the galleri divid
i can never tell all the suffer we endur upon our return my uncl
bore them like a man who ha been in the wrongthat is with
concentr and suppress anger han with all the resign of hi
pacif charact and ii confess that i did noth but complain and
despair i had no heart for thi bad fortun
but there wa on consol defeat at the outset would probabl upset
the whole journei
as i had expect from the first our suppli of water gave complet
out on our first dai march our provis of liquid wa reduc to
our suppli of schiedam but thi horriblenai i will sai itthi
infern liquor burnt the throat and i could not even bear the sight of
it i found the temperatur to be stifl i wa paralyz with
fatigu more than onc i wa about to fall insens to the ground
the whole parti then halt and the worthi iceland and my excel
uncl did their best to consol and comfort me i could howev
plainli see that my uncl wa contend painfulli against the extrem
fatigu of our journei and the aw tortur gener by the absenc
of water
at length a time came when i ceas to recollect anythingwhen all wa
on awful hideou fantast dream
at last on tuesdai the seventh of the month of juli after crawl on
our hand and knee for mani hour more dead than aliv we reach the
point of junction between the galleri i lai like a log an inert mass
of human flesh on the arid lava soil it wa then ten in the morn
han and my uncl lean against the wall tri to nibbl awai at
some piec of biscuit while deep groan and sigh escap from my
scorch and swollen lip then i fell off into a kind of deep lethargi
present i felt my uncl approach and lift me up tenderli in hi arm
poor boi i heard him sai in a tone of deep commiser
i wa profoundli touch by these word be by no mean accustom to
sign of womanli weak in the professor i caught hi trembl hand
in mine and gave them a gentl pressur he allow me to do so without
resist look at me kindli all the time hi ey were wet with
tear
i then saw him take the gourd which he wore at hi side to my surpris
or rather to my stupefact he place it to my lip
drink my boi he said
wa it possibl my ear had not deceiv me wa my uncl mad i look
at him with i am sure quit an idiot express i could not
believ him i too much fear the counteract of disappoint
drink he said again
had i heard aright befor howev i could ask myself the question a
second time a mouth of water cool my parch lip and throaton
mouth but i do believ it brought me back to life
i thank my uncl by clasp my hand my heart wa too full to speak
ye said he on mouth of water the veri lastdo you hear my
boyth veri last i have taken care of it at the bottom of my bottl
as the appl of my ey twenti time a hundr time i have resist
the fear desir to drink it butnono harri i save it for you
my dear uncl i exclaim and the big tear roll down my hot and
feverish cheek
ye my poor boi i knew that when you reach thi place thi
crossroad in the earth you would fall down half dead and i save my
last drop of water in order to restor you
thank i cri thank from my heart
as littl as my thirst wa realli quench i had nevertheless partial
recov my strength the contract muscl of my throat relaxedand
the inflamm of my lip in some measur subsid at all event i
wa abl to speak
well i said there can be no doubt now as to what we have to do
water ha utterli fail us our journei is therefor at an end let us
return
while i spoke thu my uncl evid avoid my face he held down hi
head hi ey were turn in everi possibl direct but the right
on
ye i continu get excit by my own word we must go back to
sneffel mai heaven give us strength to enabl us onc more to revisit
the light of dai would that we now stood on the summit of the crater
go back said my uncl speak to himself and must it be so
go backy and without lose a singl moment i vehement cri
for some moment there wa silenc under that dark and gloomi vault
so my dear harri said the professor in a veri singular tone of
voic those few drop of water have not suffic to restor your
energi and courag
courag i cri
i see that you ar quit as downcast as beforeand still give wai to
discourag and despair
what then wa the man made of and what other project were enter
hi fertil and audaci brain
you ar not discourag sir
what give up just as we ar on the verg of success he cri
never never shall it be said that professor hardwigg retreat
then we must make up our mind to perish i cri with a helpless
sigh
no harri my boi certainli not go leav me i am veri far from
desir your death take han with you ii will go on alonei
you ask us to leav you
leav me i sai i have undertaken thi danger and peril
adventur i will carri it to the endor i will never return to the
surfac of mother earth go harryonc more i sai to yougo
my uncl as he spoke wa terribl excit hi voic which befor had
been tender almost womanli becam harsh and menac he appear to
be struggl with desper energi against the imposs i did not
wish to abandon him at the bottom of that abyss while on the other
hand the instinct of preserv told me to fly
meanwhil our guid wa look on with profound calm and
indiffer he appear to be an unconcern parti and yet he
perfectli well knew what wa go on between us our gestur
suffici indic the differ road each wish to followand
which each tri to influenc the other to undertak but han appear
not to take the slightest interest in what wa realli a question of life
and death for us all but wait quit readi to obei the signal which
should sai go aloft or to resum hi desper journei into the
interior of the earth
how then i wish with all my heart and soul that i could make him
understand my word my represent my sigh and groan the
earnest accent in which i should have spoken would have convinc that
cold hard natur those fear danger and peril of which the stolid
guid had no idea i would have point them out to himi would have
as it were made him see and feel between us we might have convinc
the obstin professor if the worst had come to the worst we could
have compel him to return to the summit of sneffel
i quietli approach han i caught hi hand in mine he never move a
muscl i indic to him the road to the top of the crater he
remain motionless my pant form my haggard counten must have
indic the extent of my suffer the iceland gentli shook hi
head and point to my uncl
master he said
the word is iceland as well as english
the master i cri besid myself with furymadman noi tell you
he is not the master of our live we must fly we must drag him with
us do you hear me do you understand me i sai
i have alreadi explain that i held han by the arm i tri to make
him rise from hi seat i struggl with him and tri to forc him
awai my uncl now interpos
my good henri be calm he said you will obtain noth from my
devot follow therefor listen to what i have to sai
i fold my arm as well as i could and look my uncl full in the
face
thi wretch want of water he said is the sole obstacl to the
success of my project in the entir galleri made of lava schist and
coal it is true we found not on liquid molecul it is quit possibl
that we mai be more fortun in the western tunnel
my sole repli wa to shake my head with an air of deep incredul
listen to me to the end said the professor in hi wellknown
lectur voic while you lai yonder without life or motion i
undertook a reconnoit journei into the conform of thi other
galleri i have discov that it goe directli downward into the
bowel of the earth and in a few hour will take us to the old granit
format in thi we shall undoubtedli find innumer spring the
natur of the rock make thi a mathemat certainti and instinct
agre with logic to sai that it is so now thi is the seriou
proposit which i have to make to you when christoph columbu ask
of hi men three dai to discov the land of promis hi men ill
terrifi and hopeless yet gave him three daysand the new world wa
discov now i the christoph columbu of thi subterranean region
onli ask of you on more dai if when that time is expir i have not
found the water of which we ar in search i swear to you i will give
up my mighti enterpris and return to the earth surfac
despit my irrit and despair i knew how much it cost my uncl to
make thi proposit and to hold such conciliatori languag under the
circumst what could i do but yield
well i cri let it be as you wish and mai heaven reward your
superhuman energi but as unless we discov water our hour ar
number let us lose no time but go ahead
chapter 19
the western gallerya new rout
our descent wa now resum by mean of the second galleri han took up
hi post in front as usual we had not gone more than a hundr yard
when the professor carefulli examin the wall
thi is the primit formationw ar on the right roadonward is
our hope
when the whole earth got cool in the first hour of the world morn
the diminut of the volum of the earth produc a state of
disloc in it upper crust follow by ruptur crevass and
fissur the passag wa a fissur of thi kind through which ag
ago had flow the erupt granit the thousand wind and turn
form an inextric labyrinth through the ancient soil
as we descend success of layer compos the primit soil
appear with the utmost fidel of detail geolog scienc
consid thi primit soil as the base of the miner crust and it
ha recogn that it is compos of three differ strata or layer
all rest on the immov rock known as granit
no mineralogist had even found themselv place in such a marvel
posit to studi natur in all her real and nake beauti the sound
rod a mere machin could not bring to the surfac of the earth the
object of valu for the studi of it intern structur which we were
about to see with our own ey to touch with our own hand
rememb that i am write thi after the journei
across the streak of the rock color by beauti green tint wound
metal thread of copper of manganes with trace of platinum and
gold i could not help gaze at these rich buri in the entrail of
mother earth and of which no man would have the enjoy to the end of
time these treasuresmighti and inexhaust were buri in the
morn of the earth histori at such aw depth that no crowbar or
pickax will ever drag them from their tomb
the light of our ruhmkorff coil increas tenfold by the myriad of
prismat mass of rock sent it jet of fire in everi direct and
i could fanci myself travel through a huge hollow diamond the rai
of which produc myriad of extraordinari effect
toward six oclock thi festiv of light began sensibl and visibl
to decreas and soon almost ceas the side of the galleri assum a
crystal tint with a somber hue white mica began to commingl more
freeli with feldspar and quartz to form what mai be call the true
rockth stone which is hard abov all that support without be
crush the four stori of the earth soil
we were wall by an immens prison of granit
it wa now eight oclock and still there wa no sign of water the
suffer i endur were horribl my uncl now kept at the head of our
littl column noth could induc him to stop i meanwhil had but
on real thought my ear wa keenli on the watch to catch the sound of a
spring but no pleasant sound of fall water fell upon my listen
ear
but at last the time came when my limb refus to carri me longer i
contend heroic against the terribl tortur i endur becaus i
did not wish to compel my uncl to halt to him i knew thi would be the
last fatal stroke
suddenli i felt a deadli faint come over me my ey could no longer
see my knee shook i gave on despair cryand fell
help help i am dy
my uncl turn and slowli retrac hi step he look at me with
fold arm and then allow on sentenc to escap in hollow accent
from hi lip
all is over
the last thing i saw wa a face fearfulli distort with pain and
sorrow and then my ey close
when i again open them i saw my companion ly near me motionless
wrap in their huge travel rug were thei asleep or dead for
myself sleep wa wholli out of the question my faint fit over i
wa wake as the lark i suffer too much for sleep to visit my
eyelidsth more that i thought myself sick unto deathdi the
last word spoken by my uncl seem to be buzz in my earsal is
over and it wa probabl that he wa right in the state of prostrat
to which i wa reduc it wa mad to think of ever again see the
light of dai
abov were mile upon mile of the earth crust as i thought of it i
could fanci the whole weight rest on my shoulder i wa crush
annihil and exhaust myself in vain attempt to turn in my granit
bed
hour upon hour pass awai a profound and terribl silenc reign
around usa silenc of the tomb noth could make itself heard
through these gigant wall of granit the veri thought wa
stupend
present despit my apathi despit the kind of deadli calm into which
i wa cast someth arous me it wa a slight but peculiar nois
while i wa watch intent i observ that the tunnel wa becom
dark then gaze through the dim light that remain i thought i saw
the iceland take hi departur lamp in hand
why had he act thu did han the guid mean to abandon us my uncl
lai fast asleepor dead i tri to cry out and arous him my voic
feebli issu from my parch and fever lip found no echo in that
fear place my throat wa dry my tongu stuck to the roof of my
mouth the obscur had by thi time becom intens and at last even
the faint sound of the guid footstep wa lost in the blank distanc
my soul seem fill with anguish and death appear welcom onli let
it come quickli
han is leav us i cri hanshan if you ar a man come
back
these word were spoken to myself thei could not be heard aloud
nevertheless after the first few moment of terror were over i wa
asham of my suspicion against a man who hitherto had behav so
admir noth in hi conduct or charact justifi suspicion
moreov a moment reflect reassur me hi departur could not be
a flight instead of ascend the galleri he wa go deeper down
into the gulf had he had ani bad design hi wai would have been
upward
thi reason calm me a littl and i began to hope
the good and peac and imperturb han would certainli not have
arisen from hi sleep without some seriou and grave motiv wa he bent
on a voyag of discoveri dure the deep still silenc of the night
had he at last heard that sweet murmur about which we were all so
anxiou
chapter 20
water where is it a bitter disappoint
dure a long long weari hour there cross my wildli deliri brain
all sort of reason as to what could have arous our quiet and
faith guid the most absurd and ridicul idea pass through my
head each more imposs than the other i believ i wa either half
or wholli mad
suddenli howev there aros as it were from the depth of the earth
a voic of comfort it wa the sound of footstep han wa return
present the uncertain light began to shine upon the wall of the
passag and then it came in view far down the slope tunnel at length
han himself appear
he approach my uncl place hi hand upon hi shoulder and gentli
awaken him my uncl as soon as he saw who it wa instantli aros
well exclaim the professor
vatten said the hunter
i did not know a singl word of the danish languag and yet by a sort
of mysteri instinct i understood what the guid had said
water water i cri in a wild and frantic tone clap my hand
and gesticul like a madman
water murmur my uncl in a voic of deep emot and gratitud
hvar where
nedat below
where below i understood everi word i had caught the hunter by the
hand and i shook them heartili while he look on with perfect
calm
the prepar for our departur did not take long and we were soon
make a rapid descent into the tunnel
an hour later we had advanc a thousand yard and descend two
thousand feet
at thi moment i heard an accustom and wellknown sound run along
the floor of the granit rocka kind of dull and sullen roar like
that of a distant waterfal
dure the first half hour of our advanc not find the discov
spring my feel of intens suffer appear to return onc more i
began to lose all hope my uncl howev observ how downheart i
wa again becom took up the convers
han wa right he exclaim enthusiast that is the dull
roar of a torrent
a torrent i cri delight at even hear the welcom word
there not the slightest doubt about it he repli a subterranean
river is flow besid us
i made no repli but hasten on onc more anim by hope i began
not even to feel the deep fatigu which hitherto had overpow me the
veri sound of thi gloriou murmur water alreadi refresh me we
could hear it increas in volum everi moment the torrent which for
a long time could be heard flow over our head now ran distinctli
along the left wall roar rush splutter and still fall
sever time i pass my hand across the rock hope to find some trace
of humidityof the slightest percol ala in vain
again a half hour pass in the same weari toil again we advanc
it now becam evid that the hunter dure hi absenc had not been
abl to carri hi research ani farther guid by an instinct peculiar
to the dweller in mountain region and water finder he smelt the
live spring through the rock still he had not seen the preciou
liquid he had neither quench hi own thirst nor brought us on drop
in hi gourd
moreov we soon made the disastr discoveri that if our progress
continu we should soon be move awai from the torrent the sound of
which gradual diminish we turn back han halt at the precis
spot where the sound of the torrent appear nearest
i could bear the suspens and suffer no longer and seat myself
against the wall behind which i could hear the water seeth and
effervesc not two feet awai but a solid wall of granit still
separ us from it
han look keenli at me and strang enough for onc i thought i saw
a smile on hi imperturb face
he rose from a stone on which he had been seat and took up the lamp
i could not help rise and follow he move slowli along the firm
and solid granit wall i watch him with mingl curios and
eager present he halt and place hi ear against the dry stone
move slowli along and listen with the most extrem care and
attent i understood at onc that he wa search for the exact spot
where the torrent roar wa most plainli heard thi point he soon
found in the later wall on the left side about three feet abov the
level of the tunnel floor
i wa in a state of intens excit i scarc dare believ what
the eiderduck hunter wa about to do it wa howev imposs in a
moment more not to both understand and applaud and even to smother him
in my embrac when i saw him rais the heavi crowbar and commenc an
attack upon the rock itself
save i cri
ye cri my uncl even more excit and delight than myself
han is quit right oh the worthi excel man we should never
have thought of such an idea
and nobodi els i think would have done so such a process simpl as
it seem would most certainli not have enter our head noth
could be more danger than to begin to work with pickax in that
particular part of the globe suppos while he wa at work a breakup
were to take place and suppos the torrent onc have gain an inch
were to take an ell and come pour bodili through the broken rock
not on of these danger wa chimer thei were onli too real but at
that moment no fear of fall in of the roof or even of inund wa
capabl of stop us our thirst wa so intens that to quench it we
would have dug below the bed of old ocean itself
han went quietli to worka work which neither my uncl nor i would
have undertaken at ani price our impati wa so great that if we had
onc begun with pickax and crowbar the rock would soon have split into
a hundr fragment the guid on the contrari calm readi moder
wore awai the hard rock by littl steadi blow of hi instrument make
no attempt at a larger hole than about six inch as i stood i heard
or i thought i heard the roar of the torrent momentarili increas in
loud and at time i almost felt the pleasant sensat of water
upon my parch lip
at the end of what appear an ag han had made a hole which enabl
hi crowbar to enter two feet into the solid rock he had been at work
exactli an hour it appear a dozen i wa get wild with
impati my uncl began to think of us more violent measur i
had the greatest difficulti in check him he had inde just got hold
of hi crowbar when a loud and welcom hiss wa heard then a stream or
rather jet of water burst through the wall and came out with such forc
as to hit the opposit side
han the guid who wa half upset by the shock wa scarc abl to
keep down a cry of pain and grief i understood hi mean when
plung my hand into the sparkl jet i myself gave a wild and
frantic cry the water wa scald hot
boil i cri in bitter disappoint
well never mind said my uncl it will soon get cool
the tunnel began to be fill by cloud of vapor while a small stream
ran awai into the interior of the earth in a short time we had some
suffici cool to drink we swallow it in huge mouth
oh what exalt delightwhat rich and incompar luxuri what wa
thi water whenc did it come to us what wa that the simpl fact
wasit wa water and though still with a tingl of warmth about it
it brought back to the heart that life which but for it must sure
have fade awai i drank greedili almost without tast it
when howev i had almost quench my raven thirst i made a
discoveri
why it is chalyb water
a most excel stomach repli my uncl and highli miner
here is a journei worth twenti to spa
it veri good i repli
i should think so water found six mile under ground there is a
peculiarli inki flavor about it which is by no mean disagre han
mai congratul himself on have made a rare discoveri what do you
sai nephew accord to the usual custom of travel to name the
stream after him
good said i and the name of hansbach han brook wa at onc
agre upon
han wa not a bit more proud after hear our determin than he
wa befor after have taken a veri small modicum of the welcom
refresh he had seat himself in a corner with hi usual
imperturb graviti
now said i it is not worth while let thi water run to wast
what is the us repli my uncl the sourc from which thi river
rise is inexhaust
never mind i continu let us fill our goatskin and gourd and
then try to stop the open up
my advic after some hesit wa follow or attempt to be
follow han pick up all the broken piec of granit he had knock
out and us some tow he happen to have about him tri to shut up
the fissur he had made in the wall all he did wa to scald hi hand
the pressur wa too great and all our attempt were utter failur
it is evid i remark that the upper surfac of these spring is
situat at a veri great height abovea we mai fairli infer from the
great pressur of the jet
that is by no mean doubt repli my uncl if thi column of
water is about thirtytwo thousand feet high the atmospher pressur
must be someth enorm but a new idea ha just struck me
and what is that
why be at so much troubl to close thi apertur
becaus
i hesit and stammer have no real reason
when our water bottl ar empti we ar not at all sure that we shall
be abl to fill them observ my uncl
i think that is veri probabl
well then let thi water run it will of cours natur follow in
our track and will serv to guid and refresh us
i think the idea a good on i cri in repli and with thi rivulet
as a companion there is no further reason why we should not succe in
our marvel project
ah my boi said the professor laugh after all you ar come
round
more than that i am now confid of ultim success
on moment nephew mine let us begin by take some hour of repos
i had utterli forgotten that it wa night the chronomet howev
inform me of the fact soon we were suffici restor and
refresh and had all fallen into a profound sleep
chapter 21
under the ocean
by the next dai we had nearli forgotten our past suffer the first
sensat i experienc wa surpris at not be thirsti and i
actual ask myself the reason the run stream which flow in
rippl wavelet at my feet wa the satisfactori repli
we breakfast with a good appetit and then drank our fill of the
excel water i felt myself quit a new man readi to go anywher my
uncl chose to lead i began to think why should not a man as serious
convinc as my uncl succe with so excel a guid as worthi
han and so devot a nephew as myself these were the brilliant idea
which now invad my brain had the proposit now been made to go back
to the summit of mount sneffel i should have declin the offer in a
most indign manner
but fortun there wa no question of go up we were about to
descend farther into the interior of the earth
let us be move i cri awaken the echo of the old world
we resum our march on thursdai at eight oclock in the morn the
great granit tunnel as it went round by sinuou and wind wai
present everi now and then sharp turn and in fact all the appear
of a labyrinth it direct howev wa in gener toward the
southwest my uncl made sever paus in order to consult hi compass
the galleri now began to trend downward in a horizont direct with
about two inch of fall in everi furlong the murmur stream flow
quietli at our feet i could not but compar it to some familiar spirit
guid us through the earth and i dabbl my finger in it tepid
water which sang like a naiad as we progress my good humor began to
assum a mytholog charact
as for my uncl he began to complain of the horizont charact of the
road hi rout he found began to be indefinit prolong instead
of slide down the celesti rai accord to hi express
but we had no choic and as long as our road led toward the
centrehowev littl progress we made there wa no reason to
complain
moreov from time to time the slope were much greater the naiad sang
more loudli and we began to dip downward in earnest
as yet howev i felt no pain sensat i had not got over the
excit of the discoveri of water
that dai and the next we did a consider amount of horizont and
rel veri littl vertic travel
on fridai even the tenth of juli accord to our estim we
ought to have been thirti leagu to the southeast of reykjavik and
about two leagu and a half deep we now receiv a rather startl
surpris
under our feet there open a horribl well my uncl wa so delight
that he actual clap hi handsa he saw how steep and sharp wa
the descent
ah ah he cri in raptur delight thi will take us a long wai
look at the project of the rock hah he exclaim it a fear
staircas
han howev who in all our troubl had never given up the rope
took care so to dispos of them as to prevent ani accid our descent
then began i dare not call it a peril descent for i wa alreadi too
familiar with that sort of work to look upon it as anyth but a veri
ordinari affair
thi well wa a kind of narrow open in the massiv granit of the
kind known as a fissur the contract of the terrestri scaffold
when it suddenli cool had been evid the caus if it had ever
serv in former time as a kind of funnel through which pass the
erupt mass vomit by sneffel i wa at a loss to explain how it
had left no mark we were in fact descend a spiral someth like
those wind staircas in us in modern hous
we were compel everi quarter of an hour or thereabout to sit down in
order to rest our leg our calv ach we then seat ourselv on
some project rock with our leg hang over and gossip while we
at a mouthfuldrink still from the pleasantli warm run stream
which had not desert us
it is scarc necessari to sai that in thi curious shape fissur
the hansbach had becom a cascad to the detriment of it size it wa
still howev suffici and more for our want besid we knew
that as soon as the decliv ceas to be so abrupt the stream must
resum it peac cours at thi moment it remind me of my uncl
hi impati and rage while when it flow more peacefulli i
pictur to myself the placid of the iceland guid
dure the whole of two dai the sixth and seventh of juli we follow
the extraordinari spiral staircas of the fissur penetr two
leagu farther into the crust of the earth which put us five leagu
below the level of the sea on the eighth howev at twelv oclock in
the dai the fissur suddenli assum a much more gentl slope still
trend in a southeast direct
the road now becam compar easi and at the same time dreadfulli
monoton it would have been difficult for matter to have turn out
otherwis our peculiar journei had no chanc of be diversifi by
landscap and sceneri at all event such wa my idea
at length on wednesdai the fifteenth we were actual seven leagu
twentyon mile below the surfac of the earth and fifti leagu
distant from the mountain of sneffel though if the truth be told we
were veri tire our health had resist all suffer and wa in a
most satisfactori state our travel box of medica had not even
been open
my uncl wa care to note everi hour the indic of the compass
of the manomet and of the thermomet all which he afterward
publish in hi elabor philosoph and scientif account of our
remark voyag he wa therefor abl to give an exact relat of
the situat when therefor he inform me that we were fifti
leagu in a horizont direct distant from our start point i
could not suppress a loud exclam
what is the matter now cri my uncl
noth veri import onli an idea ha enter my head wa my
repli
well out with it my boi
it is my opinion that if your calcul ar correct we ar no longer
under iceland
do you think so
we can veri easili find out i repli pull out a map and
compass
you see i said after care measur that i am not mistaken
we ar far beyond cape portland and those fifti leagu to the
southeast will take us into the open sea
under the open sea cri my uncl rub hi hand with a delight
air
ye i cri no doubt old ocean flow over our head
well my dear boi what can be more natur do you not know that in
the neighborhood of newcastl there ar coal mine which have been
work far out under the sea
now my worthi uncl the professor no doubt regard thi discoveri as
a veri simpl fact but to me the idea wa by no mean a pleasant on
and yet when on came to think the matter over serious what matter
it whether the plain and mountain of iceland were suspend over our
devot head or the mighti billow of the atlant ocean the whole
question rest on the solid of the granit roof abov us howev i
soon got us to the ideal for the passag now level now run down
and still alwai to the southeast kept go deeper and deeper into the
profound abyss of mother earth
three dai later on the eighteenth dai of juli on a saturdai we
reach a kind of vast grotto my uncl here paid han hi usual
rixdollar and it wa decid that the next dai should be a dai of
rest
chapter 22
sundai below ground
i awok on sundai morn without ani sens of hurri and bustl
attend on an immedi departur though the dai to be devot to
repos and reflect wa spent under such strang circumst and in
so wonder a place the idea wa a pleasant on besid we all began
to get us to thi kind of exist i had almost ceas to think of
the sun of the moon of the star of the tree hous and town in
fact about ani terrestri necess in our peculiar posit we
were far abov such reflect
the grotto wa a vast and magnific hall along it granit soil the
stream flow placidli and pleasantli so great a distanc wa it now
from it fieri sourc that it water wa scarc lukewarm and could be
drunk without delai or difficulti
after a frugal breakfast the professor made up hi mind to devot some
hour to put hi note and calcul in order
in the first place he said i have a good mani to verifi and prove
in order that we mai know our exact posit i wish to be abl on our
return to the upper region to make a map of our journei a kind of
vertic section of the globe which will be as it were the profil of
the expedit
that would inde be a curiou work uncl but can you make your
observ with anyth like certainti and precis
i can i have never on ani occas fail to note with great care the
angl and slope i am certain as to have made no mistak take the
compass and examin how she point
i look at the instrument with care
east on quarter southeast
veri good resum the professor note the observ and go
through some rapid calcul i make out that we have journei two
hundr and fifti mile from the point of our departur
then the mighti wave of the atlant ar roll over our head
certainli
and at thi veri moment it is possibl that fierc tempest ar rage
abov and that men and ship ar battl against the angri blast just
over our head
it is quit within the rang of possibl rejoin my uncl
smile
and that whale ar plai in shoal thrash the bottom of the sea
the roof of our adamantin prison
be quit at rest on that point there is no danger of their break
through but to return to our calcul we ar to the southeast two
hundr and fifti mile from the base of sneffel and accord to my
preced note i think we have gone sixteen leagu in a downward
direct
sixteen leaguesfifti mile i cri
i am sure of it
but that is the extrem limit allow by scienc for the thick of
the earth crust i repli refer to my geolog studi
i do not contraven that assert wa hi quiet answer
and at thi stage of our journei accord to all known law on the
increas of heat there should be here a temperatur of ififteen hundr
degre of reaumuri
there should beyou sai my boi
in which case thi granit would not exist but be in a state of
fusion
but you perceiv my boi that it is not so and that fact as usual
ar veri stubborn thing overrul all theori
i am forc to yield to the evid of my sens but i am
nevertheless veri much surpris
what heat doe the thermomet realli indic continu the
philosoph
twentyseven sixtenth
so that scienc is wrong by fourteen hundr and seventyfour degre
and fourtenth accord to which it is demonstr that the
proport increas in temperatur is an explod error humphri davi
here shine forth in all hi glori he is right and i have act wise
to believ him have you ani answer to make to thi statement
had i chosen to have spoken i might have said a great deal i in no wai
admit the theori of humphri davyi still held out for the theori of
proport increas of heat though i did not feel it
i wa far more will to allow that thi chimnei of an extinct volcano
wa cover by lava of a kind refractori to heatin fact a bad
conductorwhich did not allow the great increas of temperatur to
percol through it side the hot water jet support my view of the
matter
but without enter on a long and useless discuss or seek for
new argument to controvert my uncl i content myself with take up
fact as thei were
well sir i take for grant that all your calcul ar correct
but allow me to draw from them a rigor and definit conclus
go on my boyhav your sai cri my uncl goodhumoredli
at the place where we now ar under the latitud of iceland the
terrestri depth is about fifteen hundr and eightythre leagu
fifteen hundr eightythre and a quarter
well suppos we sai sixteen hundr in round number now out of a
voyag of sixteen hundr leagu we have complet sixteen
as you sai what then
at the expens of a diagon journei of no less than eightyf
leagu
exactli
we have been twenti dai about it
exactli twenti dai
now sixteen is the hundredth part of our contempl expedit if we
go on in thi wai we shall be two thousand dai that is about five
year and a half go down
the professor fold hi arm listen but did not speak
without count that if a vertic descent of sixteen leagu cost us
a horizont of eightyf we shall have to go about eight thousand
leagu to the southeast and we must therefor come out somewher in
the circumfer long befor we can hope to reach the centr
bother your calcul cri my uncl in on of hi old rage on
what basi do thei rest how do you know that thi passag doe not take
us direct to the end we requir moreov i have in my favor
fortun a preced what i have undertaken to do anoth ha
done and he have succeed why should i not be equal success
i hope inde you will but still i suppos i mai be allow to
you ar allow to hold your tongu cri professor hardwigg when
you talk so unreason as thi
i saw at onc that the old doctori professor wa still aliv in my
uncleand fear to rous hi angri passion i drop the unpleas
subject
now then he explain consult the manomet what doe that
indic
a consider amount of pressur
veri good you see then that by descend slowli and by gradual
accustom ourselv to the densiti of thi lower atmospher we shall
not suffer
well i suppos not except it mai be a certain amount of pain in the
ear wa my rather grim repli
that my dear boi is noth and you will easili get rid of that
sourc of discomfort by bring the exterior air in commun with
the air contain in your lung
perfectli said i for i had quit made up my mind in no wise to
contradict my uncl i should fanci almost that i should experi a
certain amount of satisfact in make a plung into thi dens
atmospher have you taken note of how wonderfulli sound is propag
of cours i have there can be no doubt that a journei into the
interior of the earth would be an excel cure for deaf
but then uncl i ventur mildli to observ thi densiti will
continu to increas
yesaccord to a law which howev is scarc defin it is true
that the intens of weight will diminish just in proport to the
depth to which we go you know veri well that it is on the surfac of
the earth that it action is most powerfulli felt while on the
contrari in the veri centr of the earth bodi ceas to have ani
weight at all
i know that is the case but as we progress will not the atmospher
final assum the densiti of water
i know it when place under the pressur of seven hundr and ten
atmospher cri my uncl with imperturb graviti
and when we ar still lower down i ask with natur anxieti
well lower down the densiti will becom even greater
then how shall we be abl to make our wai through thi atmospher
fog
well my worthi nephew we must ballast ourselv by fill our
pocket with stone said professor hardwigg
faith uncl you have an answer for everyth wa my onli repli
i began to feel that it wa unwis of me to go ani farther into the wide
field of hypothes for i should certainli have reviv some difficulti
or rather imposs that would have enrag the professor
it wa evid nevertheless that the air under a pressur which might
be multipli by thousand of atmospher would end by becom
perfectli solid and that then admit our bodi resist the
pressur we should have to stop in spite of all the reason in the
world fact overcom all argument
but i thought it best not to urg thi argument my uncl would simpli
have quot the exampl of saknussemm suppos the learn iceland
journei ever realli to have taken placether wa on simpl answer to
be made
in the sixteenth centuri neither the baromet nor the manomet had
been inventedhow then could saknussemm have been abl to discov
when he did reach the centr of the earth
thi unanswer and learn object i howev kept to myself and
brace up my courag await the cours of eventslittl awar of how
adventur yet were to be the incid of our remark journei
the rest of thi dai of leisur and repos wa spent in calcul and
convers i made it a point to agre with the professor in
everyth but i envi the perfect indiffer of han who without
take ani such troubl about the caus and effect went blindli onward
wherev destini chose to lead him
chapter 23
alon
it must in all truth be confess thing as yet had gone on well and i
should have act in bad tast to have complain if the true medium of
our difficulti did not increas it wa within the rang of
possibl that we might ultim reach the end of our journei then
what glori would be our i began in the newli arous ardor of my soul
to speak enthusiast to the professor well wa i seriou the
whole state in which we exist wa a mysteryand it wa imposs to
know whether or not i wa in earnest
for sever dai after our memor halt the slope becam more
rapidsom were even of a most fright characteralmost vertic so
that we were forev go down into the solid interior mass dure
some dai we actual descend a leagu and a half even two leagu
toward the centr of the earth the descent were suffici
peril and while we were engag in them we learn fulli to
appreci the marvel cool of our guid han without him we
should have been wholli lost the grave and impass iceland devot
himself to us with the most incomprehens sangfroid and eas and
thank to him mani a danger pass wa got over where but for him
we should inevit have stuck fast
hi silenc increas everi dai i think that we began to be influenc
by thi peculiar trait in hi charact it is certain that the
inanim object by which you ar surround have a direct action on
the brain it must be that a man who shut himself up between four wall
must lose the faculti of associ idea and word how mani person
condemn to the horror of solitari confin have gone madsimpli
becaus the think faculti have lain dormant
dure the two week that follow our last interest convers
there occur noth worthi of be especi record
i have while write these memoir tax my memori in vain for on
incid of travel dure thi particular period
but the next event to be relat is terribl inde it veri memori
even now make my soul shudder and my blood run cold
it wa on the seventh of august our constant and success descent
had taken us quit thirti leagu into the interior of the earth that
is to sai that there were abov us thirti leagu nearli a hundr
mile of rock and ocean and contin and town to sai noth
of live inhabit we were in a southeasterli direct about two
hundr leagu from iceland
on that memor dai the tunnel had begun to assum an almost
horizont cours
i wa on thi occas walk on in front my uncl had charg of on
of the ruhmkorff coil i had possess of the other by mean of it
light i wa busi examin the differ layer of granit i wa
complet absorb in my work
suddenli halt and turn round i found that i wa alon
well thought i to myself i have certainli been walk too fastor
els han and my uncl have stop to rest the best thing i can do is
to go back and find them luckili there is veri littl ascent to tire
me
i accordingli retrac my step and while do so walk for at least
a quarter of an hour rather uneasi i paus and look eagerli around
not a live soul i call aloud no repli my voic wa lost amid the
myriad cavern echo it arous
i began for the first time to feel serious uneasi a cold shiver shook
my whole bodi and perspir chill and terribl burst upon my skin
i must be calm i said speak aloud as boi whistl to drive awai
fear there can be no doubt that i shall find my companion there
cannot be two road it is certain that i wa consider ahead all i
have to do is to go back
have come to thi determin i ascend the tunnel for at least
half an hour unabl to decid if i had ever seen certain landmark
befor everi now and then i paus to discov if ani loud appeal wa
made to me well know that in that dens and intensifi atmospher i
should hear it a long wai off but no the most extraordinari silenc
reign in thi immens galleri onli the echo of my own footstep
could be heard
at last i stop i could scarc realiz the fact of my isol i
wa quit will to think that i had made a mistak but not that i wa
lost if i had made a mistak i might find my wai if losti shudder
to think of it
come come said i to myself sinc there is onli on road and thei
must come by it we shall at last meet all i have to do is still to go
upward perhap howev not see me and forget i wa ahead
thei mai have gone back in search of me still even in thi case if i
make hast i shall get up to them there can be no doubt about the
matter
but as i spoke these last word aloud it would have been quit clear to
ani listenerhad there been onethat i wa by no mean convinc of
the fact moreov in order to associ togeth these simpl idea and
to reunit them under the form of reason requir some time i could
not all at onc bring my brain to think
then anoth dread doubt fell upon my soul after all wa i ahead of
cours i wa han wa no doubt follow behind preced by my uncl i
perfectli recollect hi have stop for a moment to strap hi
baggag on hi shoulder i now rememb thi trifl detail it wa
i believ just at that veri moment that i had determin to continu my
rout
again thought i reason as calmli as wa possibl there is
anoth sure mean of not lose my wai a thread to guid me through
the labyrinthin subterran retreaton which i had forgottenmi
faith river
thi cours of reason rous my droop spirit and i resolv to
resum my journei without further delai no time wa to be lost
it wa at thi moment that i had reason to bless the thought of
my uncl when he refus to allow the eider hunter to close the
orific of the hot springthat small fissur in the great mass of
granit thi benefic spring after have save us from thirst dure
so mani dai would now enabl me to regain the right road
have come to thi mental decis i made up my mind befor i start
upward that ablut would certainli do me a great deal of good
i stop to plung my hand and forehead in the pleasant water of the
hansbach stream bless it presenc as a certain consol
conceiv my horror and stupefactioni wa tread a hard dusti
shingli road of granit the stream on which i reckon had wholli
disappear
chapter 24
lost
no word in ani human languag can depict my utter despair i wa
liter buri aliv with no other expect befor me but to die
in all the slow horribl tortur of hunger and thirst
mechan i crawl about feel the dry and arid rock never to my
fanci had i ever felt anyth so dry
but i frantic ask myself how had i lost the cours of the
flow stream there could be no doubt it had ceas to flow in the
galleri in which i now wa now i began to understand the caus of the
strang silenc which prevail when last i tri if ani appeal from my
companion might perchanc reach my ear
it so happen that when i first took an imprud step in the wrong
direct i did not perceiv the absenc of the allimport stream
it wa now quit evid that when we halt anoth tunnel must have
receiv the water of the littl torrent and that i had unconsci
enter a differ galleri to what unknown depth had my companion
gone where wa i
how to get back clue or landmark there wa absolut none my feet
left no sign on the granit and shingl my brain throb with agoni
as i tri to discov the solut of thi terribl problem my
situat after all sophistri and reflect had final to be sum
up in three aw word
ilosti lost lost
lost at a depth which to my finit understand appear to be
immeasur
these thirti leagu of the crust of the earth weigh upon my shoulder
like the globe on the shoulder of atla i felt myself crush by the
aw weight it wa inde a posit to drive the sanest man to
mad
i tri to bring my thought back to the thing of the world so long
forgotten it wa with the greatest difficulti that i succeed in do
so hamburg the hous on the konigstrass my dear cousin gretchenal
that world which had befor vanish like a shadow float befor my now
vivid imagin
there thei were befor me but how unreal under the influenc of a
terribl hallucin i saw all the incid of our journei pass
befor me like the scene of a panorama the ship and it inmat
iceland m fridriksson and the great summit of mount sneffel i said
to myself that if in my posit i retain the most faint and shadowi
outlin of a hope it would be a sure sign of approach delirium it
were better to give wai wholli to despair
in fact did i but reason with calm and philosophi what human power
wa there in exist abl to take me back to the surfac of the earth
and readi too to split asund to rend in twain those huge and mighti
vault which stand abov my head who could enabl me to find my
roadand regain my companion
insens folli and mad to entertain even a shadow of hope
oh uncl wa my despair cry
thi wa the onli word of reproach which came to my lip for i
thoroughli understood how deepli and sorrowfulli the worthi professor
would regret my loss and how in hi turn he would patient seek for
me
when i at last began to resign myself to the fact that no further aid
wa to be expect from man and know that i wa utterli powerless to
do anyth for my own salvat i kneel with earnest fervor and
ask assist from heaven the remembr of my innoc childhood
the memori of my mother known onli in my infanc came well forth
from my heart i had recours to prayer and littl as i had a right to
be rememb by him whom i had forgotten in the hour of prosper and
whom i so tardili invok i prai earnestli and sincer
thi renew of my youth faith brought about a much greater amount of
calm and i wa enabl to concentr all my strength and intellig
on the terribl realiti of my unpreced situat
i had about me that which i had at first wholli forgottenthre dai
provis moreov my water bottl wa quit full nevertheless the
on thing which it wa imposs to do wa to remain alon try to find
my companion i must at ani price but which cours should i take
should i go upward or again descend doubtless it wa right to retrac
my step in an upward direct
by do thi with care and cool i must reach the point where i had
turn awai from the rippl stream i must find the fatal bifurc
or fork onc at thi spot onc the river at my feet i could at all
event regain the aw crater of mount sneffel why had i not thought
of thi befor thi at last wa a reason hope of safeti the most
import thing then to be done wa to discov the bed of the
hansbach
after a slight meal and a draught of water i rose like a giant
refresh lean heavili on my pole i began the ascent of the
galleri the slope wa veri rapid and rather difficult but i advanc
hopefulli and carefulli like a man who at last is make hi wai out of
a forest and know there is onli on road to follow
dure on whole hour noth happen to check my progress as i
advanc i tri to recollect the shape of the tunnelto recal to my
memori certain project of rocksto persuad myself that i had
follow certain wind rout befor but no on particular sign could
i bring to mind and i wa soon forc to allow that thi galleri would
never take me back to the point at which i had separ myself from my
companion it wa absolut without issuea mere blind allei in the
earth
the moment at length came when face the solid rock i knew my fate
and fell inanim on the arid floor
to describ the horribl state of despair and fear into which i then
fell would now be vain and imposs my last hope the courag which
had sustain me droop befor the sight of thi pitiless granit
rock
lost in a vast labyrinth the sinuos of which spread in everi
direct without guid clue or compass i knew it wa a vain and
useless task to attempt flight all that remain to me wa to lie down
and die to lie down and die the most cruel and horribl of death
in my state of mind the idea came into my head that on dai perhap
when my fossil bone were found their discoveri so far below the level
of the earth might give rise to solemn and interest scientif
discuss
i tri to cry aloud but hoars hollow and inarticul sound alon
could make themselv heard through my parch lip i liter pant
for breath
in the midst of all these horribl sourc of anguish and despair a new
horror took possess of my soul my lamp by fall down had got out
of order i had no mean of repair it it light wa alreadi becom
paler and paler and soon would expir
with a strang sens of resign and despair i watch the lumin
current in the coil get less and less a process of shadow move
flash along the granit wall i scarc dare to lower my eyelid
fear to lose the last spark of thi fugit light everi instant it
seem to me that it wa about to vanish and to leav me foreverin
utter dark
at last on final trembl flame remain in the lamp i follow it
with all my power of vision i gasp for breath i concentr upon it
all the power of my soul as upon the last scintil of light i wa
ever destin to see and then i wa to be lost forev in cimmerian and
tenebr shade
a wild and plaintiv cry escap my lip on earth dure the most
profound and compar complet dark light never allow a
complet destruct and extinct of it power light is so diffus
so subtl that it permeat everywher and whatev littl mai remain
the retina of the ey will succe in find it in thi place
nothingth absolut obscur made me blind in everi sens
my head wa now wholli lost i rais my arm try the effect of the
feel in get against the cold stone wall it wa pain in the
extrem mad must have taken possess of me i knew not what i
did i began to run to fly rush at haphazard in thi inextric
labyrinth alwai go downward run wildli underneath the
terrestri crust like an inhabit of the subterranean furnac
scream roar howl until bruis by the point rock fall
and pick myself up all cover with blood seek madli to drink the
blood which drip from my torn featur mad becaus thi blood onli
trickl over my face and watch alwai for thi horrid wall which
ever present to me the fear obstacl against which i could not dash
my head
where wa i go it wa imposs to sai i wa perfectli ignor of
the matter
sever hour pass in thi wai after a long time have utterli
exhaust my strength i fell a heavi inert mass along the side of the
tunnel and lost conscious
chapter 25
the whisper galleri
when at last i came back to a sens of life and be my face wa wet
but wet as i soon knew with tear how long thi state of
insens last it is quit imposs for me now to sai i had no
mean left to me of take ani account of time never sinc the creation
of the world had such a solitud as mine exist i wa complet
abandon
after my fall i lost much blood i felt myself flood with the
lifegiv liquid my first sensat wa perhap a natur on why
wa i not dead becaus i wa aliv there wa someth left to do i
tri to make up my mind to think no longer as far as i wa abl i
drove awai all idea and utterli overcom by pain and grief i crouch
against the granit wall
i just commenc to feel the faint come on again and the sensat
that thi wa the last struggl befor complet annihilationwhen on a
sudden a violent uproar reach my ear it had some resembl to the
prolong rumbl voic of thunder and i clearli distinguish
sonor voic lost on after the other in the distant depth of the
gulf
whenc came thi nois natur it wa to be suppos from new
phenomena which were take place in the bosom of the solid mass of
mother earth the explos of some gaseou vapor or the fall of some
solid of the granit or other rock
again i listen with deep attent i wa extrem anxiou to hear if
thi strang and inexplic sound wa like to be renew a whole
quarter of an hour elaps in pain expect deep and solemn
silenc reign in the tunnel so still that i could hear the beat
of my own heart i wait wait with a strang kind of hope
suddenli my ear which lean accident against the wall appear to
catch as it were the faintest echo of a sound i thought that i heard
vagu incoher and distant voic i quiver all over with
excit and hope
it must be hallucin i cri it cannot be it is not true
but no by listen more attent i realli did convinc myself that
what i heard wa truli the sound of human voic to make ani mean
out of the sound howev wa beyond my power i wa too weak even to
hear distinctli still it wa a posit fact that someon wa speak
of that i wa quit certain
there wa a moment of fear a dread fell upon my soul that it might be
my own word brought back to me by a distant echo perhap without
know it i might have been cry aloud i resolut close my lip
and onc more place my ear to the huge granit wall
ye for certain it wa in truth the sound of human voic
i now by the exercis of great determin drag myself along the
side of the cavern until i reach a point where i could hear more
distinctli but though i could detect the sound i could onli make out
uncertain strang and incomprehens word thei reach my ear as
if thei had been spoken in a low tonemurmur as it were afar off
at last i made out the word forlorad repeat sever time in a tone
betoken great mental anguish and sorrow
what could thi word mean and who wa speak it it must be either my
uncl or the guid han if therefor i could hear them thei must
sure be abl to hear me
help i cri at the top of my voic help i am dy
i then listen with scarc a breath i pant for the slightest sound
in the darknessa cry a sigh a question but silenc reign suprem
no answer came in thi wai some minut pass a whole flood of idea
flash through my mind i began to fear that my voic weaken by
sick and suffer could not reach my companion who were in search
of me
it must be thei i cri who els could by ani possibl be buri
a hundr mile below the level of the earth the mere supposit wa
preposter
i began therefor to listen again with the most breathless attent
as i move my ear along the side of the place i wa in i found a
mathemat point as it were where the voic appear to attain their
maximum of intens the word forlorad again distinctli reach my ear
then came again that roll nois like thunder which had awaken me
out of torpor
i begin to understand i said to myself after some littl time devot
to reflect it is not through the solid mass that the sound reach
my ear the wall of my cavern retreat ar of solid granit and the
most fear explos would not make uproar enough to penetr them
the sound must come along the galleri itself the place i wa in must
possess some peculiar acoust properti of it own
again i listen and thi timey thi timei heard my name
distinctli pronounc cast as it were into space
it wa my uncl the professor who wa speak he wa in convers
with the guid and the word which had so often reach my ear
forlorad wa a danish express
then i understood it all in order to make myself heard i too must
speak as it were along the side of the galleri which would carri the
sound of my voic just as the wire carri the electr fluid from point
to point
but there wa no time to lose if my companion were onli to remov a
few feet from where thei stood the acoust effect would be over my
whisper galleri would be destroi i again therefor crawl toward
the wall and said as clearli and distinctli as i could
uncl hardwigg
i then await a repli
sound doe not possess the properti of travel with such extrem
rapid besid the densiti of the air at that depth from light and
motion wa veri far from ad to the rapid of circul sever
second elaps which to my excit imagin appear ag and
these word reach my eager ear and move my wildli beat heart
harri my boi is that you
a short delai between question and answer
yesy
where ar you
lost
and your lamp
out
but the guid stream
is lost
keep your courag harri we will do our best
on moment my uncl i cri i have no longer strength to answer
your question butfor heaven sakedo youcontinueto speakto
me absolut silenc i felt would be annihil
keep up your courag said my uncl as you ar so weak do not
speak we have been search for you in all direct both by go
upward and downward in the galleri my dear boi i had begun to give
over all hopeand you can never know what bitter tear of sorrow and
regret i have shed at last suppos you to be still on the road
besid the hansbach we again descend fire off gun as signal
now howev that we have found you and that our voic reach each
other it mai be a long time befor we actual meet we ar convers
by mean of some extraordinari acoust arrang of the labyrinth
but do not despair my dear boi it is someth gain even to hear
each other
while he wa speak my brain wa at work reflect a certain
undefin hope vagu and shapeless as yet made my heart beat wildli
in the first place it wa absolut necessari for me to know on
thing i onc more therefor lean my head against the wall which i
almost touch with my lip and again spoke
uncl
my boi wa hi answer after a few moment
it is of the utmost consequ that we should know how far we ar
asund
that is not difficult

second at which you speak i will repli as soon as i hear your

be the time occupi by my voic in reach you
that is exactli what i mean uncl wa my eager repli

well make readi i am about to pronounc your name said the
professor
i appli my ear close to the side of the cavern galleri and as
soon as the word harri reach my ear i turn round and place my
lip to the wall repeat the sound
forti second said my uncl there ha elaps forti second between
the two word the sound therefor take twenti second to ascend
now allow a thousand and twenti feet for everi secondw have
twenti thousand four hundr feeta leagu and a half and oneeighth
these word fell on my soul like a kind of death knell
a leagu and a half i mutter in a low and despair voic
it shall be got over my boi cri my uncl in a cheeri tone depend
on us
but do you know whether to ascend or descend i ask faintli enough
we have to descend and i will tell you why you have reach a vast
open space a kind of bare crossroad from which galleri diverg in
everi direct that in which you ar now ly must necessarili bring
you to thi point for it appear that all these mighti fissur these
fractur of the globe interior radiat from the vast cavern which we
at thi moment occupi rous yourself then have courag and continu
your rout walk if you can if not drag yourself alongslid if
noth els is possibl the slope must be rather rapidand you will
find strong arm to receiv you at the end of your journei make a
start like a good fellow
these word serv to rous some kind of courag in my sink frame
farewel for the present good uncl i am about to take my departur

adieu harryuntil we sai welcom such were the last word which
reach my anxiou ear befor i commenc my weari and almost hopeless
journei
thi wonder and surpris convers which took place through the
vast mass of the earth labyrinth these word exchang the speaker
be about five mile apartend with hope and pleasant
express i breath on more prayer to heaven i sent up word of
thanksgivingbeliev in my inmost heart that he had led me to the
onli place where the voic of my friend could reach my ear
thi appar astound acoust mysteri is easili explain by
simpl natur law it aros from the conduct of the rock there
ar mani instanc of thi singular propag of sound which ar not
percept in it less mediat posit in the interior galleri of
st paul and amid the curiou cavern in sicili these phenomena ar
observ the most marvel of them all is known as the ear of
dionysiu
these memori of the past of my earli read and studi came fresh
to my thought moreov i began to reason that if my uncl and i could
commun at so great a distanc no seriou obstacl could exist
between us all i had to do wa to follow the direct whenc the sound
had reach me and logic put it i must reach him if my
strength did not fail
i accordingli rose to my feet i soon found howev that i could not
walk that i must drag myself along the slope as i expect wa veri
rapid but i allow myself to slip down
soon the rapid of the descent began to assum fright proport
and menac a fear fall i clutch at the side i grasp at
project of rock i threw myself backward all in vain my weak
wa so great i could do noth to save myself
suddenli earth fail me
i wa first launch into a dark and gloomi void i then struck against
the project asper of a vertic galleri a perfect well my head
bound against a point rock and i lost all knowledg of exist
as far as i wa concern death had claim me for hi own
chapter 26
a rapid recoveri
when i return to the conscious of exist i found myself
surround by a kind of semiobscur ly on some thick and soft
coverlet my uncl wa watchinghi ey fix intent on my
counten a grave express on hi face a tear in hi ey at the
first sigh which struggl from my bosom he took hold of my hand when
he saw my ey open and fix themselv upon hi he utter a loud cry
of joi he live he live
ye my good uncl i whisper
my dear boi continu the grim professor clasp me to hi heart
you ar save
i wa deepli and unaffectedli touch by the tone in which these word
were utter and even more by the kindli care which accompani them
the professor howev wa on of those men who must be sever tri
in order to induc ani displai of affect or gentl emot at thi
moment our friend han the guid join us he saw my hand in that of
my uncl and i ventur to sai that taciturn as he wa hi ey beam
with live satisfact

but i cri let me know what oclock it iswhat dai it is
it is now eleven oclock at night and thi is onc more sundai it is
now the ninth of the month of august and i distinctli prohibit you from
ask ani more question until the tenth of the same
i wa if the truth were told veri weak inde and my ey soon close
involuntarili i did requir a good night rest and i went off
reflect at the last moment that my peril adventur in the interior
of the earth in total dark had last four dai
on the morn of the next dai at my awaken i began to look around
me my sleep place made of all our travel bed wa in a
charm grotto adorn with magnific stalagmit glitter in all
the color of the rainbow the floor of soft and silveri sand
a dim obscur prevail no torch no lamp wa light and yet
certain unexplain beam of light penetr from without and made
their wai through the open of the beauti grotto
i moreov heard a vagu and indefinit murmur like the ebb and flow
of wave upon a strand and sometim i verili believ i could hear the
sigh of the wind
i began to believ that instead of be awak i must be dream
sure my brain had not been affect by my fall and all that occur
dure the last twentyfour hour wa not the frenzi vision of
mad and yet after some reflect a trial of my faculti i came
to the conclus that i could not be mistaken ey and ear could not
sure both deceiv me
it is a rai of the bless daylight i said to myself which ha
penetr through some mighti fissur in the rock but what is the
mean of thi murmur of wave thi unmistak moan of the
saltsea billow i can hear too plainli enough the whistl of the
wind but can i be altogeth mistaken if my uncl dure my ill
ha but carri me back to the surfac of the earth ha he on my
account given up hi wondrou expedit or in some strang manner ha
it come to an end
i wa puzzl my brain over these and other question when the
professor join me
good dai harri he cri in a joyou tone i fanci you ar quit
well
i am veri much better i repli actual sit up in my bed
i knew that would be the end of it as you slept both soundli and
tranquilli han and i have each taken turn to watch and everi hour we
have seen visibl sign of amelior
you must be right uncl wa my repli for i feel as if i could do
justic to ani meal you could put befor me
you shall eat my boi you shall eat the fever ha left you our
excel friend han ha rub your wound and bruis with i know not
what ointment of which the iceland alon possess the secret and
thei have heal your bruis in the most marvel manner ah he a
wise fellow is master han
while he wa speak my uncl wa place befor me sever articl
of food which despit hi earnest injunct i readili devour as
soon as the first rage of hunger wa appeas i overwhelm him with
question to which he now no longer hesit to give answer
i then learn for the first time that my providenti fall had
brought me to the bottom of an almost perpendicular galleri as i came
down amidst a perfect shower of stone the least of which fall on
me would have crush me to death thei came to the conclus that i
had carri with me an entir disloc rock ride as it were on thi
terribl chariot i wa cast headlong into my uncl arm and into
them i fell insens and cover with blood
it is inde a miracl wa the professor final remark that you
were not kill a thousand time over but let us take care never to
separ for sure we should risk never meet again
let us take care never again to separ
these word fell with a sort of chill upon my heart the journei then
wa not over i look at my uncl with surpris and astonish my
uncl after an instant examin of my counten said what is
the matter harri
i want to ask you a veri seriou question you sai that i am all right
in health
certainli you ar
and all my limb ar sound and capabl of new exert i ask
most undoubtedli
but what about my head wa my next anxiou question
well your head except that you have on or two contus is exactli
where it ought to beon your shoulder said my uncl laugh
well my own opinion is that my head is not exactli right in fact i
believ myself slightli deliri
what make you think so
i will explain why i fanci i have lost my sens i cri have we
not return to the surfac of mother earth
certainli not
then truli i must be mad for do i not see the light of dai do i not
hear the whistl of the wind and can i not distinguish the wash of a
great sea
and that is all that make you uneasi said my uncl with a smile
can you explain
i will not make ani attempt to explain for the whole matter is utterli
inexplic but you shall see and judg for yourself you will then
find that geolog scienc is as yet in it infancyand that we ar
doom to enlighten the world
let us advanc then i cri eagerli no longer abl to restrain my
curios
wait a moment my dear harri he respond you must take precaut
after your ill befor go into the open air

chapter 27
the central sea
at first i saw absolut noth my ey wholli unus to the
effulg of light could not bear the sudden bright and i wa
compel to close them when i wa abl to reopen them i stood still
far more stupefi than astonish not all the wildest effect of
imagin could have conjur up such a scene the seath sea i
cri
ye repli my uncl in a tone of pardon pride the central
sea no futur navig will deni the fact of my have discov it
and henc of acquir a right of give it a name
it wa quit true a vast limitless expans of water the end of a lake
if not of an ocean spread befor us until it wa lost in the distanc
the shore which wa veri much indent consist of a beauti soft
golden sand mix with small shell the longdesert home of some of
the creatur of a past ag the wave broke incessantlyand with a
peculiarli sonor murmur to be found in underground local a
slight frothi flake aros as the wind blew along the pellucid water
and mani a dash of sprai wa blown into my face the mighti
superstructur of rock which rose abov to an inconceiv height left
onli a narrow openingbut where we stood there wa a larg margin of
strand on all side were cape and promontori and enorm cliff
partial worn by the etern break of the wave through countless
ag and as i gaze from side to side the mighti rock fade awai like
a fleeci film of cloud
it wa in realiti an ocean with all the usual characterist of an
inland sea onli horribl wildso rigid cold and savag
on thing startl and puzzl me greatli how wa it that i wa abl to
look upon that vast sheet of water instead of be plung in utter
dark the vast landscap befor me wa lit up like dai but there
wa want the dazzl brillianc the splendid irradi of the
sun the pale cold illumin of the moon the bright of the
star the illumin power in thi subterranean region from it
trembl and ricker charact it clear dry white the veri
slight elev of it temperatur it great superior to that of
the moon wa evid electr someth in the natur of the aurora
boreali onli that it phenomena were constant and abl to light up
the whole of the ocean cavern
the tremend vault abov our head the sky so to speak appear to
be compos of a conglomer of nebul vapor in constant motion
i should origin have suppos that under such an atmospher
pressur as must exist in that place the evapor of water could not
realli take place and yet from the action of some physic law which
escap my memori there were heavi and dens cloud roll along that
mighti vault partial conceal the roof electr current produc
astonish plai of light and shade in the distanc especi around
the heavier cloud deep shadow were cast beneath and then suddenli
between two cloud there would come a rai of unusu beauti and
remark intens and yet it wa not like the sun for it gave no
heat
the effect wa sad and excruciatingli melancholi instead of a nobl
firmament of blue stud with star there wa abov me a heavi roof
of granit which seem to crush me
gaze around i began to think of the theori of the english captain who
compar the earth to a vast hollow sphere in the interior of which the
air is retain in a lumin state by mean of atmospher pressur
while two star pluto and proserpin circl there in their mysteri
orbit after all suppos the old fellow wa right
in truth we were imprisonedbound as it were in a vast excav
it width it wa imposs to make out the shore on either hand
widen rapidli until lost to sight while it length wa equal
uncertain a haze on the distant horizon bound our view as to it
height we could see that it must be mani mile to the roof look
upward it wa imposs to discov where the stupend roof began
the lowest of the cloud must have been float at an elev of two
thousand yard a height greater than that of terrestri vapor which
circumst wa doubtless ow to the extrem densiti of the air
i us the word cavern in order to give an idea of the place i cannot
describ it aw grandeur human languag fail to convei an idea of
it savag sublim whether thi singular vacuum had or had not been
caus by the sudden cool of the earth when in a state of fusion i
could not sai i had read of most wonder and gigant cavernsbut
none in ani wai like thi
the great grotto of guachara in colombia visit by the learn
humboldt the vast and partial explor mammoth cave in kentuckywhat
were these hole in the earth to that in which i stood in speechless
admir with it vapori cloud it electr light and the mighti
ocean slumber in it bosom imagin not descript can alon
give an idea of the splendor and vast of the cave
i gaze at these marvel in profound silenc word were utterli want
to indic the sensat of wonder i experienc i seem as i stood
upon that mysteri shore as if i were some wander inhabit of a
distant planet present for the first time at the spectacl of some
terrestri phenomena belong to anoth exist to give bodi and
exist to such new sensat would have requir the coinag of new
wordsand here my feebl brain found itself wholli at fault i look
on i thought i reflect i admir in a state of stupefact not
altogeth unmingl with fear
the unexpect spectacl restor some color to my pallid cheek i
seem to be actual get better under the influenc of thi
novelti moreov the vivac of the dens atmospher reanim my
bodi by inflat my lung with unaccustom oxygen
it will be readili conceiv that after an imprison of fortyseven
dai in a dark and miser tunnel it wa with infinit delight that i
breath thi salin air it wa like the genial reviv influenc of
the salt sea wave
my uncl had alreadi got over the first surpris
with the latin poet horac hi idea wa that
not to admir is all the art i know
to make man happi and to keep him so
well he said after give me time thoroughli to appreci the
marvel of thi underground sea do you feel strong enough to walk up
and down
certainli wa my readi answer noth would give me greater
pleasur
well then my boi he said lean on my arm and we will stroll along
the beach
i accept hi offer eagerli and we began to walk along the shore of
thi extraordinari lake to our left were abrupt rock pile on upon
the othera stupend titan pile down their side leap
innumer cascad which at last becom limpid and murmur
stream were lost in the water of the lake light vapor which rose
here and there and float in fleeci cloud from rock to rock
indic hot spring which also pour their superflu into the vast
reservoir at our feet
among them i recogn our old and faith stream the hansbach
which lost in that wild basin seem as if it had been flow sinc
the creation of the world
we shall miss our excel friend i remark with a deep sigh
bah said my uncl testili what matter it that or anoth it is
all the same
i thought the remark ungrat and felt almost inclin to sai so but
i forbor
at thi moment my attent wa attract by an unexpect spectacl
after we had gone about five hundr yard we suddenli turn a steep
promontori and found ourselv close to a lofti forest it consist of
straight trunk with tuft top in shape like parasol the air seem
to have no effect upon these treeswhich in spite of a toler breez
remain as still and motionless as if thei had been petrifi
i hasten forward i could find no name for these singular format
did thei not belong to the two thousand and more known treesor were we
to make the discoveri of a new growth by no mean when we at last
reach the forest and stood beneath the tree my surpris gave wai to
admir
in truth i wa simpli in the presenc of a veri ordinari product of the
earth of singular and gigant proport my uncl unhesitatingli
call them by their real name
it is onli he said in hi coolest manner a forest of mushroom
on close examin i found that he wa not mistaken judg of the
develop attain by thi product of damp hot soil i had heard that
the lycoperdon giganteum reach nine feet in circumfer but here
were white mushroom nearli forti feet high and with top of equal
dimens thei grew in countless thousandsth light could not make
it wai through their massiv substanc and beneath them reign a
gloomi and mystic dark
still i wish to go forward the cold in the shade of thi singular
forest wa intens for nearli an hour we wander about in thi visibl
dark at length i left the spot and onc more return to the
shore of the lake to light and compar warmth
but the amaz veget of subterran land wa not confin to
gigant mushroom new wonder await us at everi step we had not
gone mani hundr yard when we came upon a mighti group of other tree
with discolor leavesth common humbl tree of mother earth of an
exorbit and phenomen size lycopod a hundr feet high flower
fern as tall as pine gigant grass
astonish magnific splendid cri my uncl here we have
befor us the whole flora of the second period of the world that of
transit behold the humbl plant of our garden which in the first
ag of the world were mighti tree look around you my dear harri no
botanist ever befor gaze on such a sight
my uncl enthusiasm alwai a littl more than wa requir wa now
excus
you ar right uncl i remark provid appear to have design
the preserv in thi vast and mysteri hothous of antediluvian
plant to prove the sagac of learn men in figur them so
marvel on paper
well said my boyveri well said it is inde a mighti hothous but
you would also be within the bound of reason and common sens if you
ad that it is also a vast menageri
i look rather anxious around if the anim were as exagger as
the plant the matter would certainli be seriou
a menageri
doubtless look at the dust we ar tread under footbehold the
bone with which the whole soil of the seashor is cover
bone i repli ye certainli the bone of antediluvian anim
i stoop down as i spoke and pick up on or two singular remain
relic of a bygon ag it wa easi to give a name to these gigant
bone in some instanc as big as trunk of tree
here is clearli the lower jawbon of a mastodon i cri almost as
warmli and enthusiast as my uncl here ar the molar of the
dinotherium here is a leg bone which belong to the megatherium you
ar right uncl it is inde a menageri for the mighti anim to
which these bone onc belong have live and di on the shore of
thi subterranean sea under the shadow of these plant look yonder
ar whole skeletonsand yet
and yet nephew said my uncl notic that i suddenli came to a
full stop
i do not understand the presenc of such beast in granit cavern
howev vast and prodigi wa my repli
why not said my uncl with veri much of hi old profession
impati
becaus it is well known that anim life onli exist on earth dure
the secondari period when the sedimentari soil wa form by the
alluvium and thu replac the hot and burn rock of the primit
ag
i have listen to you earnestli and with patienc harri and i have a
simpl and clear answer to your object and that is that thi
itself is a sedimentari soil
how can that be at such enorm depth from the surfac of the earth
the fact can be explain both simpli and geolog at a certain
period the earth consist onli of an elast crust liabl to
altern upward and downward movement in virtu of the law of
attract it is veri probabl that mani a landslip took place in those
dai and that larg portion of sedimentari soil were cast into huge
and mighti chasm
quit possibl i dryli remark but uncl if these antediluvian
anim formerli live in these subterranean region what more like
than that on of these monster mai at thi moment be conceal behind
on of yonder mighti rock
as i spoke i look keenli around examin with care everi point of
the horizon but noth aliv appear to exist on these desert
shore
i now felt rather fatigu and told my uncl so the walk and
excit were too much for me in my weak state i therefor seat
myself at the end of a promontori at the foot of which the wave broke
in incess roll i look round a bai form by project of vast
granit rock at the extrem end wa a littl port protect by huge
pyramid of stone a brig and three or four schooner might have lain
there with perfect eas so natur did it seem that everi minut my
imagin induc me to expect a vessel come out under all sail and
make for the open sea under the influenc of a warm southerli breez
but the fantast illus never last more than a minut we were the
onli live creatur in thi subterranean world
dure certain period there wa an utter cessat of wind when a
silenc deeper more terribl than the silenc of the desert fell upon
these solitari and arid rocksand seem to hang like a leaden weight
upon the water of thi singular ocean i sought amid the aw
still to penetr through the distant fog to tear down the veil
which conceal the mysteri distanc what unspoken word were
murmur by my trembl lipswhat question did i wish to ask and did
not where did thi sea endto what did it lead should we ever be abl
to examin it distant shore
but my uncl had no doubt about the matter he wa convinc that our
enterpris would in the end be success for my part i wa in a state
of pain indecisioni desir to embark on the journei and to
succe and still i fear the result
after we had pass an hour or more in silent contempl of the
wondrou spectacl we rose and went down toward the bank on our wai to
the grotto which i wa not sorri to gain after a slight repast i
sought refug in slumber and at length after mani and tediou
struggl sleep came over my weari ey
chapter 28
launch the raft
on the morn of the next dai to my great surpris i awok complet
restor i thought a bath would be delight after my long ill and
suffer so soon after rise i went and plung into the water of
thi new mediterranean the bath wa cool fresh and invigor
i came back to breakfast with an excel appetit han our worthi
guid thoroughli understood how to cook such eatabl as we were abl
to provid he had both fire and water at discret so that he wa
enabl slightli to vari the weari monotoni of our ordinari repast
our morn meal wa like a capit english breakfast with coffe by
wai of a windup and never had thi delici beverag been so welcom
and refresh
my uncl had suffici regard for my state of health not to interrupt
me in the enjoy of the meal but he wa evid delight when i
had finish
now then said he come with me it is the height of the tide and i
am anxiou to studi it curiou phenomena
what i cri rise in astonish did you sai the tide uncl
certainli i did
you do not mean to sai i repli in a tone of respect doubt
that the influenc of the sun and moon is felt here below
and prai why not ar not all bodi influenc by the law of univers
attract why should thi vast underground sea be exempt from the
gener law the rule of the univers besid there is noth like
that which is prove and demonstr despit the great atmospher
pressur down here you will notic that thi inland sea rise and fall
with as much regular as the atlant itself
as my uncl spoke we reach the sandi shore and saw and heard the
wave break monoton on the beach thei were evid rise
thi is truli the flood i cri look at the water at my feet
ye my excel nephew repli my uncl rub hi hand with the
gusto of a philosoph and you see by these sever streak of foam
that the tide rise at least ten or twelv feet
it is inde marvel
by no mean he respond on the contrari it is quit natur
it mai appear so in your ey my dear uncl wa my repli but all
the phenomena of the place appear to me to partak of the marvel it
is almost imposs to believ that which i see who in hi wildest
dream could have imagin that beneath the crust of our earth there
could exist a real ocean with eb and flow tide with it
chang of wind and even it storm i for on should have laugh the
suggest to scorn
but harri my boi why not inquir my uncl with a piti smile
is there ani physic reason in opposit to it
well if we give up the great theori of the central heat of the earth
i certainli can offer no reason why anyth should be look upon as
imposs
then you will own he ad that the system of sir humphri davi is
wholli justifi by what we have seen
i allow that it isand that point onc grant i certainli can see no
reason for doubt the exist of sea and other wonder even
countri in the interior of the globe
that is sobut of cours these vari countri ar uninhabit
well i grant that it is more like than not still i do not see why
thi sea should not have given shelter to some speci of unknown fish
hitherto we have not discov ani and the probabl ar rather
against our ever do so observ the professor
i wa lose my skeptic in the presenc of these wonder
well i am determin to solv the question it is my intent to try
my luck with my fish line and hook
certainli make the experi said my uncl pleas with my
enthusiasm while we ar about it it will certainli be onli proper to
discov all the secret of thi extraordinari region
but after all where ar we now i ask all thi time i have quit
forgotten to ask you a question which doubtless your philosoph
instrument have long sinc answer
well repli the professor examin the situat from onli on
point of view we ar now distant three hundr and fifti leagu from
iceland
so much wa my exclam
i have gone over the matter sever time and am sure not to have made
a mistak of five hundr yard repli my uncl posit
and as to the directionar we still go to the southeast
ye with a western declination2 of nineteen degre fortytwo
minut just as it is abov as for the inclination3 i have
discov a veri curiou fact
2 the declin is the variat of the needl from the true
meridian of a place
3 inclin is the dip of the magnet needl with a tendenc to
inclin toward the earth
what mai that be uncl your inform interest me
why that the needl instead of dip toward the pole as it doe on
earth in the northern hemispher ha an upward tendenc
thi prove i cri that the great point of magnet attract
li somewher between the surfac of the earth and the spot we have
succeed in reach
exactli my observ nephew exclaim my uncl elat and
delight and it is quit probabl that if we succe in get
toward the polar regionssomewher near the seventythird degre of
latitud where sir jame ross discov the magnet pole we shall
behold the needl point directli upward we have therefor discov by
analog that thi great centr of attract is not situat at a veri
great depth
well said i rather surpris thi discoveri will astonish
experiment philosoph it wa never suspect
scienc great mighti and in the end uner repli my uncl
dogmat scienc ha fallen into mani errorserror which have
been fortun and us rather than otherwis for thei have been the
steppingston to truth
after some further discuss i turn to anoth matter
have you ani idea of the depth we have reach
we ar now continu the professor exactli thirtyf
leaguesabov a hundr milesdown into the interior of the earth
so said i after measur the distanc on the map we ar now
beneath the scottish highland and have over our head the lofti
grampian hill
you ar quit right said the professor laugh it sound veri
alarm the weight be heavybut the vault which support thi vast
mass of earth and rock is solid and safe the mighti architect of the
univers ha construct it of solid materi man even in hi highest
flight of vivid and poetic imagin never thought of such thing
what ar the finest arch of our bridg what the vault roof of our
cathedr to that mighti dome abov us and beneath which float an
ocean with it storm and calm and tide
i admir it all as much as you can uncl and have no fear that our
granit sky will fall upon our head but now that we have discuss
matter of scienc and discoveri what ar your futur intent ar
you not think of get back to the surfac of our beauti earth
thi wa said more as a feeler than with ani hope of success
go back nephew cri my uncl in a tone of alarm you ar not
sure think of anyth so absurd or cowardli no my intent is
to advanc and continu our journei we have as yet been singularli
fortun and henceforth i hope we shall be more so
but said i how ar we to cross yonder liquid plain
it is not my intent to leap into it head foremost or even to swim
across it like leander over the hellespont but as ocean ar after
all onli great lake inasmuch as thei ar surround by land so doe
it stand to reason that thi central sea is circumscrib by granit
surround
doubtless wa my natur repli
well then do you not think that when onc we reach the other end we
shall find some mean of continu our journei
probabl but what extent do you allow to thi intern ocean
well i should fanci it to extend about forti or fifti leaguesmor or
less
but even suppos thi approxim to be a correct onewhat then
i ask
my dear boi we have no time for further discuss we shall embark
tomorrow
i look around with surpris and incredul i could see noth in
the shape of boat or vessel
what i cri we ar about to launch out upon an unknown sea and
where if i mai ask is the vessel to carri us
well my dear boi it will not be exactli what you would call a vessel
for the present we must be content with a good and solid raft
a raft i cri incredul but down here a raft is as imposs
of construct as a vesseland i am at a loss to imagin
my good harryif you were to listen instead of talk so much you
would hear said my uncl wax a littl impati
i should hear
yescertain knock with the hammer which han is now emploi to
make the raft he ha been at work for mani hour
make a raft
ye
but where ha he found tree suitabl for such a construct
he found the tree all readi to hi hand come and you shall see our
excel guid at work
more and more amaz at what i heard and saw i follow my uncl like
on in a dream
after a walk of about a quarter of an hour i saw han at work on the
other side of the promontori which form our natur port a few
minut more and i wa besid him to my great surpris on the sandi
shore lai a halffinish raft it wa made from beam of a veri
peculiar wood and a great number of limb joint bough and piec
lai about suffici to have construct a fleet of ship and boat
i turn to my uncl silent with astonish and aw
where did all thi wood come from i cri what wood is it
well there is pinewood fir and the palm of the northern region
miner by the action of the sea he repli sententi
can it be possibl
ye said the learn professor what you see is call fossil wood
but then cri i after reflect for a moment like the lignit
it must be as hard and as heavi as iron and therefor will certainli
not float
sometim that is the case mani of these wood have becom true
anthracit but other again like those you see befor you have onli
undergon on phase of fossil transform but there is no proof like
demonstr ad my uncl pick on or two of these preciou
waif and cast them into the sea
the piec of wood after have disappear for a moment came to the
surfac and float about with the oscil produc by wind and
tide
ar you convinc said my uncl with a selfsatisfi smile
i am convinc i cri that what i see is incred
the fact wa that my journei into the interior of the earth wa rapidli
chang all preconceiv notion and dai by dai prepar me for the
marvel
i should not have been surpris to have seen a fleet of nativ cano
afloat upon that silent sea
the veri next even thank to the industri and abil of han the
raft wa finish it wa about ten feet long and five feet wide the
beam bound togeth with stout rope were solid and firm and onc
launch by our unit effort the improvis vessel float tranquilli
upon the water of what the professor had well name the central sea
chapter 29
on the watersa raft voyag
on the thirteenth of august we were up betim there wa no time to be
lost we now had to inaugur a new kind of locomot which would
have the advantag of be rapid and not fatigu
a mast made of two piec of wood fasten togeth to give addit
strength a yard made from anoth on the sail a linen sheet from our
bed we were fortun in no want of cordag and the whole on trial
appear solid and seaworthi
at six oclock in the morn when the eager and enthusiast professor
gave the signal to embark the victual the luggag all our
instrument our weapon and a goodli suppli of sweet water which we
had collect from spring in the rock were place on the raft
han had with consider ingenu contriv a rudder which enabl
him to guid the float apparatu with eas he took the tiller as a
matter of cours the worthi man wa as good a sailor as he wa a guid
and duck hunter i then let go the painter which held us to the shore
the sail wa brought to the wind and we made a rapid of
our sea voyag had at length commenc and onc more we were make for
distant and unknown region
just as we were about to leav the littl port where the raft had been
construct my uncl who wa veri strong as to geograph
nomenclatur want to give it a name and among other suggest
mine
well said i befor you decid i have anoth to propos
well out with it
i should like to call it gretchen port gretchen will sound veri well
on our futur map
well then port gretchen let it be said the professor
and thu it wa that the memori of my dear girl wa attach to our
adventur and memor expedit
when we left the shore the wind wa blow from the northward and
eastward we went directli befor the wind at a much greater speed than
might have been expect from a raft the dens layer of atmospher at
that depth had great propel power and act upon the sail with
consider forc
at the end of an hour my uncl who had been take care
observ wa enabl to judg of the rapid with which we move
it wa far beyond anyth seen in the upper world
if he said we continu to advanc at our present rate we shall
have travel at least thirti leagu in twentyfour hour with a mere
raft thi is an almost incred veloc
i certainli wa surpris and without make ani repli went forward
upon the raft alreadi the northern shore wa fade awai on the edg of
the horizon the two shore appear to separ more and more leav
a wide and open space for our departur befor me i could see noth
but the vast and appar limitless seaupon which we floatedth
onli live object in sight
huge and dark cloud cast their grei shadow belowshadow which seem
to crush that colorless and sullen water by their weight anyth more
suggest of gloom and of region of nether dark i never beheld
silveri rai of electr light reflect here and there upon some small
spot of water brought up lumin sparkl in the long wake of our
cumbrou bark present we were wholli out of sight of land not a
vestig could be seen nor ani indic of where we were go so
still and motionless did we seem without ani distant point to fix our
ey on that but for the phosphor light at the wake of the raft i
should have fanci that we were still and motionless
but i knew that we were advanc at a veri rapid rate
about twelv oclock in the dai vast collect of seawe were
discov surround us on all side i wa awar of the extraordinari
veget power of these plant which have been known to creep along
the bottom of the great ocean and stop the advanc of larg ship but
never were seawe ever seen so gigant and wonder as those of the
central sea i could well imagin how seen at a distanc toss and
heav on the summit of the billow the long line of alga have been
taken for live thing and thu have been fertil sourc of the
belief in sea serpent
our raft swept past great specimen of fucu or seawrack from three to
four thousand feet in length immens incred long look like
snake that stretch out far beyond our horizon it afford me great
amus to gaze on their varieg ribbonlik endless length hour
after hour pass without our come to the termin of these
float weed if my astonish increas my patienc wa wellnigh
exhaust
what natur forc could possibl have produc such abnorm and
extraordinari plant what must have been the aspect of the globe
dure the first centuri of it format when under the combin
action of heat and humid the veget kingdom occupi it vast
surfac to the exclus of everyth els
these were consider of neverend interest for the geologist and
the philosoph
all thi while we were advanc on our journei and at length night
came but as i had remark the even befor the lumin state of
the atmospher wa in noth diminish whatev wa the caus it wa
a phenomenon upon the durat of which we could calcul with
certainti
as soon as our supper had been dispos of and some littl specul
convers indulg in i stretch myself at the foot of the mast
and present went to sleep
han remain motionless at the tiller allow the raft to rise and
fall on the wave the wind be aft and the sail squar all he had
to do wa to keep hi oar in the centr
ever sinc we had taken our departur from the newli name port
gretchen my worthi uncl had direct me to keep a regular log of our
dai navig with instruct to put down even the most minut
particular everi interest and curiou phenomenon the direct of
the wind our rate of sail the distanc we went in a word everi
incid of our extraordinari voyag
from our log therefor i tell the stori of our voyag on the central
sea
fridai august 14th a steadi breez from the northwest raft
progress with extrem rapid and go perfectli straight coast
still dimli visibl about thirti leagu to leeward noth to be seen
beyond the horizon in front the extraordinari intens of the light
neither increas nor diminish it is singularli stationari the
weather remark fine that is to sai the cloud have ascend veri
high and ar light and fleeci and surround by an atmospher
resembl silver in fusion
thermomet 32 degre centigrad
about twelv oclock in the dai our guid han have prepar and
bait a hook cast hi line into the subterranean water the bait he
us wa a small piec of meat by mean of which he conceal hi hook
anxiou as i wa i wa for a long time doom to disappoint were
these water suppli with fish or not that wa the import question
nowa my decid answer then there came a sudden and rather hard tug
han coolli drew it in and with it a fish which struggl violent to
escap
a fish cri my uncl
it is a sturgeon i cri certainli a small sturgeon
the professor examin the fish carefulli note everi characterist
and he did not coincid in my opinion the fish had a flat head round
bodi and the lower extrem cover with boni scale it mouth wa
wholli without teeth the pector fin which were highli develop
sprout direct from the bodi which properli speak had no tail the
anim certainli belong to the order in which naturalist class the
sturgeon but it differ from that fish in mani essenti particular
my uncl after all wa not mistaken after a long and patient
examin he said
thi fish my dear boi belong to a famili which ha been extinct for
ag and of which no trace ha ever been found on earth except fossil
remain in the devonian strata
you do not mean to sai i cri that we have captur a live
specimen of a fish belong to the primit stock that exist befor
the delug
we have said the professor who all thi time wa continu hi
observ and you mai see by care examin that these fossil
fish have no ident with exist speci to hold in on hand
therefor a live specimen of the order is enough to make a
naturalist happi for life
but cri i to what famili doe it belong
to the order of ganoidesan order of fish have angular scale
cover with bright enamelform on of the famili of the
cephalaspid of the genu
well sir i remark as i notic my uncl hesit to conclud
to the genu pterychtisy i am certain of it still though i am
confid of the correct of my surmis thi fish offer to our
notic a remark peculiar never known to exist in ani other fish
but those which ar the nativ of subterranean water well lake in
cavern and suchlik hidden pool
and what mai that be
it is blind
blind i cri much surpris
not onli blind continu the professor but absolut without
organ of sight
i now examin our discoveri for myself it wa singular to be sure
but it wa realli a fact thi howev might be a solitari instanc i
suggest the hook wa bait again and onc more thrown into the
water thi subterranean ocean must have been toler well suppli
with fish for in two hour we took a larg number of pterychti as
well as other fish belong to anoth suppos extinct familyth
dipterid a genu of fish furnish with two fin onli whenc the
name though my uncl could not class it exactli all without
except howev were blind thi unexpect captur enabl us to
renew our stock of provis in a veri satisfactori wai
we were now convinc that thi subterranean sea contain onli fish
known to us as fossil specimensand fish and reptil alik were all
the more perfect the farther back thei date their origin
we began to hope that we should find some of those saurian which
scienc ha succeed in reconstruct from bit of bone or cartilag
i took up the telescop and carefulli examin the horizonlook over
the whole sea it wa utterli and entir desert doubtless we were
still too near the coast
after an examin of the ocean i look upward toward the strang
and mysteri sky why should not on of the bird reconstruct by the
immort cuvier flap hi stupend wing aloft in the dull strata of
subterranean air it would of cours find quit suffici food from
the fish in the sea i gaze for some time upon the void abov it wa
as silent and as desert as the shore we had but late left
nevertheless though i could neither see nor discov anyth my
imagin carri me awai into wild hypothes i wa in a kind of
wake dream i thought i saw on the surfac of the water those enorm
antediluvian turtl as big as float island upon those dull and
somber shore pass a spectral row of the mammif of earli dai the
great liptotherium found in the cavern hollow of the brazilian hill
the mesicotherium a nativ of the glacial region of siberia
farther on the pachydermat lophrodon that gigant tapir which
conceal itself behind rock readi to do battl for it prei with the
anoplotherium a singular anim partak of the natur of the
rhinocero the hors the hippopotamu and the camel
there wa the giant mastodon twist and turn hi horrid trunk
with which he crush the rock of the shore to powder while the
megatheriumhi back rais like a cat in a passion hi enorm claw
stretch out dug into the earth for food at the same time that he
awok the sonor echo of the whole place with hi terribl roar
higher up still the first monkei ever seen on the face of the globe
clamber gambol and plai up the granit hill still farther
awai ran the pterodactyl with the wing hand glide or rather
sail through the dens and compress air like a huge bat
abov all near the leaden granit sky were immens bird more
power than the cassowari and the ostrich which spread their mighti
wing and flutter against the huge stone vault of the inland sea
i thought such wa the effect of my imagin that i saw thi whole
tribe of antediluvian creatur i carri myself back to far ag long
befor man existedwhen in fact the earth wa in too imperfect a
state for him to live upon it
my dream wa of countless ag befor the exist of man the
mammif first disappear then the mighti bird then the reptil of
the secondari period present the fish the crustacea the mollusk
and final the vertebrata the zoophyt of the period of transit in
their turn sank into annihil
the whole panorama of the world life befor the histor period
seem to be born over again and mine wa the onli human heart that
beat in thi unpeopl world there were no more season there were no
more climat the natur heat of the world increas unceasingli and
neutral that of the great radiant sun
veget wa exagger in an extraordinari manner i pass like a
shadow in the midst of brushwood as lofti as the giant tree of
california and trod underfoot the moist and humid soil reek with a
rank and vari veget
i lean against the huge columnlik trunk of giant tree to which
those of canada were as fern whole ag pass hundr upon hundr
of year were concentr into a singl dai
next unrol befor me like a panorama came the great and wondrou
seri of terrestri transform plant disappear the granit
rock lost all trace of solid the liquid state wa suddenli
substitut for that which had befor exist thi wa caus by
intens heat act on the organ matter of the earth the water
flow over the whole surfac of the globe thei boil thei were
volatil or turn into vapor a kind of steam cloud wrap the
whole earth the globe itself becom at last noth but on huge
sphere of ga indescrib in color between white heat and red as
big and as brilliant as the sun
in the veri centr of thi prodigi mass fourteen hundr thousand
time as larg as our globe i wa whirl round in space and brought
into close conjunct with the planet my bodi wa subtil or
rather becam volatil and commingl in a state of atom vapor with
the prodigi cloud which rush forward like a mighti comet into
infinit space
what an extraordinari dream where would it final take me my feverish
hand began to write down the marvel detailsdetail more like the
imagin of a lunat than anyth sober and real i had dure thi
period of hallucin forgotten everythingth professor the guid
and the raft on which we were float my mind wa in a state of
semioblivion
what is the matter harri said my uncl suddenli
my ey which were wide open like those of a somnambulist were fix
upon him but i did not see him nor could i clearli make out anyth
around me
take care my boi again cri my uncl you will fall into the sea
as he utter these word i felt myself seiz on the other side by the
firm hand of our devot guid had it not been for the presenc of mind
of han i must infal have fallen into the wave and been drown
have you gone mad cri my uncl shake me on the other side
whatwhat is the matter i said at last come to myself
ar you ill henri continu the professor in an anxiou tone
nono but i have had an extraordinari dream it howev ha pass
awai all now seem well i ad look around me with strang
puzzl ey
all right said my uncl a beauti breez a splendid sea we ar
go along at a rapid rate and if i am not out in my calcul we
shall soon see land i shall not be sorri to exchang the narrow limit
of our raft for the mysteri strand of the subterranean ocean
as my uncl utter these word i rose and carefulli scan the
horizon but the line of water wa still confound with the lower
cloud that hung aloft and in the distanc appear to touch the edg
of the water
chapter 30
terrif saurian combat
saturdai august 15th the sea still retain it uniform monotoni the
same leaden hue the same etern glare from abov no indic of
land be in sight the horizon appear to retreat befor us more and
more as we advanc
my head still dull and heavi from the effect of my extraordinari
dream which i cannot as yet banish from my mind
the professor who ha not dream is howev in on of hi moros
and unaccount humor spend hi time in scan the horizon at
everi point of the compass hi telescop is rais everi moment to hi
ey and when he find noth to give ani clue to our whereabout he
assum a napoleon attitud and walk anxious
i remark that my uncl the professor had a strong tendenc to resum
hi old impati charact and i could not but make a note of thi
disagre circumst in my journal i saw clearli that it had
requir all the influenc of my danger and suffer to extract from
him on scintil of human feel now that i wa quit recov
hi origin natur had conquer and obtain the upper hand
and after all what had he to be angri and annoi about now more than
at ani other time wa not the journei be accomplish under the most
favor circumst wa not the raft progress with the most
marvel rapid
what then could be the matter after on or two preliminari hem i
determin to inquir
you seem uneasi uncl said i when for about the hundredth time he
put down hi telescop and walk up and down mutter to himself
no i am not uneasi he repli in a dry harsh tone by no mean
perhap i should have said impati i repli soften the forc
of my remark
enough to make me so i think
and yet we ar advanc at a rate seldom attain by a raft i
remark
what matter that cri my uncl i am not vex at the rate we go
at but i am annoi to find the sea so much vaster than i expect
i then recollect that the professor befor our departur had
estim the length of thi subterranean ocean as at most about thirti
leagu now we had travel at least over thrice that distanc without
discov ani trace of the distant shore i began to understand my
uncl anger
we ar not go down suddenli exclaim the professor we ar not
progress with our great discoveri all thi is utter loss of time
after all i did not come from home to undertak a parti of pleasur
thi voyag on a raft over a pond annoi and weari me
he call thi adventur journei a parti of pleasur and thi great
inland sea a pond
but argu i if we have follow the rout indic by the great
saknussemm we cannot be go far wrong
that is the question as the great the immort shakespear ha it
ar we follow the rout indic by that wondrou sage did
saknussemm ever fall in with thi great sheet of water if he did did
he cross it i begin to fear that the rivulet we adopt for a guid ha
led us wrong
in ani case we can never regret have come thu far it is worth the
whole journei to have enjoi thi magnific spectacleit is
someth to have seen
i care noth about see nor about magnific spectacl i came
down into the interior of the earth with an object and that object i
mean to attain dont talk to me about admir sceneri or ani other
sentiment trash
after thi i thought it well to hold my tongu and allow the professor
to bite hi lip until the blood came without further remark
at six oclock in the even our matteroffact guid han ask for
hi week salari and receiv hi three rixdollar put them
carefulli in hi pocket he wa perfectli content and satisfi
sundai august 16th noth new to record the same weather as befor
the wind ha a slight tendenc to freshen up with sign of an
approach gale when i awok my first observ wa in regard to
the intens of the light i keep on fear dai after dai that the
extraordinari electr phenomenon should becom first obscur and then
go wholli out leav us in total dark noth howev of the
kind occur the shadow of the raft it mast and sail is clearli
distinguish on the surfac of the water
thi wondrou sea is after all infinit in it extent it must be
quit as wide as the mediterraneanor perhap even as the great
atlant ocean why after all should it not be so
my uncl ha on more than on occas tri deepsea sound he
ti the cross of on of our heaviest crowbar to the extrem of a
cord which he allow to run out to the extent of two hundr fathom
we had the greatest difficulti in hoist in our novel kind of lead
when the crowbar wa final drag on board han call my attent
to some singular mark upon it surfac the piec of iron look as if
it had been crush between two veri hard substanc
i look at our worthi guid with an inquir glanc
tander said he
of cours i wa at a loss to understand i turn round toward my
uncl absorb in gloomi reflect i had littl wish to disturb him
from hi reveri i accordingli turn onc more toward our worthi
iceland
han veri quietli and significantli open hi mouth onc or twice as
if in the act of bite and in thi wai made me understand hi mean
teeth cri i with stupefact as i examin the bar of iron with
more attent
ye there can be no doubt about the matter the indent on the bar
of iron ar the mark of teeth what jaw must the owner of such molar
be possess of have we then come upon a monster of unknown speci
which still exist within the vast wast of watersa monster more
voraci than a shark more terribl and bulki than the whale i am
unabl to withdraw my ey from the bar of iron actual half crush
is then my dream about to come truea dread and terribl realiti
all dai my thought were bent upon these specul and my
imagin scarc regain a degre of calm and power of
reflect until after a sleep of mani hour
thi dai as on other sundai we observ as a dai of rest and piou
medit
mondai august 17th i have been try to realiz from memori the
particular instinct of those antediluvian anim of the secondari
period which succeed to the mollusca to the crustacea and to the
fish preced the appear of the race of mammif the gener
of reptil then reign suprem upon the earth these hideou monster
rule everyth in the sea of the secondari period which form the
strata of which the jura mountain ar compos natur had endow them
with perfect organ what a gigant structur wa their what
vast and prodigi strength thei possess
the exist saurian which includ all such reptil as lizard
crocodil and allig even the largest and most formid of
their class ar but feebl imit of their mighti sire the
anim of ag long ago if there were giant in the dai of old there
were also gigant anim
i shudder as i evolv from my mind the idea and recollect of these
aw monster no ey of man had seen them in the flesh thei took
their walk abroad upon the face of the earth thousand of ag befor
man came into exist and their fossil bone discov in the
limeston have allow us to reconstruct them anatom and thu to
get some faint idea of their coloss format
i recollect onc see in the great museum of hamburg the skeleton of
on of these wonder saurian it measur no less than thirti feet
from the nose to the tail am i then an inhabit of the earth of the
present dai destin to find myself face to face with a repres
of thi antediluvian famili i can scarc believ it possibl i can
hardli believ it true and yet these mark of power teeth upon the
bar of iron can there be a doubt from their shape that the bite is the
bite of a crocodil
my ey stare wildli and with terror upon the subterranean sea everi
moment i expect on of these monster to rise from it vast cavern
depth
i fanci that the worthi professor in some measur share my notion if
not my fear for after an attent examin of the crowbar he
cast hi ey rapidli over the mighti and mysteri ocean
what could possess him to leav the land i thought as if the depth
of thi water wa of ani import to us no doubt he ha disturb
some terribl monster in hi wateri home and perhap we mai pai dearli
for our temer
anxiou to be prepar for the worst i examin our weapon and saw
that thei were in a fit state for us my uncl look on at me and
nod hi head approvingli he too ha notic what we have to fear
alreadi the uplift of the water on the surfac indic that
someth is in motion below the danger approach it come nearer and
nearer it behoov us to be on the watch
tuesdai august 18th even came at last the hour when the desir for
sleep caus our eyelid to be heavi night there is not properli
speak in thi place ani more than there is in summer in the arctic
region han howev is immov at the rudder when he snatch a
moment of rest i realli cannot sai i take advantag of hi vigil to
take some littl repos
but two hour after i wa awaken from a heavi sleep by an aw shock
the raft appear to have struck upon a sunken rock it wa lift right
out of the water by some wondrou and mysteri power and then start
off twenti fathom distant
eh what is it cri my uncl start up ar we shipwreck or
what
han rais hi hand and point to where about two hundr yard off
a larg black mass wa move up and down
i look with aw my worst fear were realiz
it is a coloss monster i cri clasp my hand
ye cri the agit professor and there yonder is a huge sea
lizard of terribl size and shape
and farther on behold a prodigi crocodil look at hi hideou jaw
and that row of monstrou teeth ha he ha gone
a whale a whale shout the professor i can see her enorm fin
see see how she blow air and water
two liquid column rose to a vast height abov the level of the sea
into which thei fell with a terrif crash wake up the echo of that
aw place we stood stillsurpris stupefi terrorstricken at
the sight of thi group of fear marin monster more hideou in the
realiti than in my dream thei were of supernatur dimens the veri
smallest of the whole parti could with eas have crush our raft and
ourselv with a singl bite
han seiz the rudder which had flown out of hi hand put it hard
aweath in order to escap from such danger vicin but no sooner
doe he do so than he find he is fly from scylla to charybdi to
leeward is a turtl about forti feet wide and a serpent quit as long
with an enorm and hideou head peer from out the water
look which wai we will it is imposs for us to fly the fear
reptil advanc upon us thei turn and twist about the raft with
aw rapid thei form around our devot vessel a seri of
concentr circl i took up my rifl in desper but what effect
can a rifl ball produc upon the armor scale with which the bodi of
these horrid monster ar cover
we remain still and dumb from utter horror thei advanc upon us nearer
and nearer our fate appear certain fear and terribl on on side
the mighti crocodil on the other the great sea serpent the rest of
the fear crowd of marin prodigi have plung beneath the brini
wave and disappear
i am about to fire at ani risk and try the effect of a shot han the
guid howev interf by a sign to check me the two hideou and
raven monster pass within fifti fathom of the raft and then made
a rush at on anothertheir furi and rage prevent them from see
us
the combat commenc we distinctli made out everi action of the two
hideou monster
but to my excit imagin the other anim appear about to take
part in the fierc and deadli struggleth monster the whale the
lizard and the turtl i distinctli saw them everi moment i point
them out to the iceland but he onli shook hi head
tva he said
whattwo onli doe he sai sure he is mistaken i cri in a tone
of wonder
he is quit right repli my uncl coolli and philosoph
examin the terribl duel with hi telescop and speak as if he
were in a lectur room
how can that be
ye it is so the first of these hideou monster ha the snout of a
porpois the head of a lizard the teeth of a crocodil and it is thi
that ha deceiv us it is the most fear of all antediluvian
reptil the worldrenown ichthyosauru or great fish lizard
and the other
the other is a monstrou serpent conceal under the hard vault
shell of the turtl the terribl enemi of it fear rival the
plesiosauru or sea crocodil
han wa quit right the two monster onli disturb the surfac of
the sea
at last have mortal ey gaze upon two reptil of the great primit
ocean i see the flame red ey of the ichthyosauru each as big or
bigger than a man head natur in it infinit wisdom had gift thi
wondrou marin anim with an optic apparatu of extrem power
capabl of resist the pressur of the heavi layer of water which
roll over him in the depth of the ocean where he usual fed it ha
by some author truli been call the whale of the saurian race for it
is as big and quick in it motion as our king of the sea thi on
measur not less than a hundr feet in length and i can form some
idea of hi girth when i see him lift hi prodigi tail out of the
water hi jaw is of aw size and strength and accord to the
bestinform naturalist it doe not contain less than a hundr and
eightytwo teeth
the other wa the mighti plesiosauru a serpent with a cylindr
trunk with a short stumpi tail with fin like a bank of oar in a
roman gallei
it whole bodi cover by a carapac or shell and it neck as flexibl
as that of a swan rose more than thirti feet abov the wave a tower
of anim flesh
these anim attack on anoth with inconceiv furi such a
combat wa never seen befor by mortal ey and to us who did see it
it appear more like the phantasmagor creation of a dream than
anyth els thei rais mountain of water which dash in sprai
over the raft alreadi toss to and fro by the wave twenti time we
seem on the point of be upset and hurl headlong into the wave
hideou hiss appear to shake the gloomi granit roof of that mighti
cavernhiss which carri terror to our heart the aw combat
held each other in a tight embrac i could not make out on from the
other still the combat could not last forev and woe unto us
whichsoev becam the victor
on hour two hour three hour pass awai without ani decis
result the struggl continu with the same deadli tenac but
without appar result the deadli oppon now approach now drew
awai from the raft onc or twice we fanci thei were about to leav us
altogeth but instead of that thei came nearer and nearer
we crouch on the raft readi to fire at them at a moment notic poor
as the prospect of hurt or terrifi them wa still we were
determin not to perish without a struggl
suddenli the ichthyosauru and the plesiosauru disappear beneath the
wave leav behind them a maelstrom in the midst of the sea we were
nearli drawn down by the indraft of the water
sever minut elaps befor anyth wa again seen wa thi
wonder combat to end in the depth of the ocean wa the last act of
thi terribl drama to take place without spectat
it wa imposs for us to sai
suddenli at no great distanc from us an enorm mass rise out of
the watersth head of the great plesiosauru the terribl monster is
now wound unto death i can see noth now of hi enorm bodi all
that could be distinguish wa hi serpentlik neck which he twist
and curl in all the agoni of death now he struck the water with it
as if it had been a gigant whip and then again wriggl like a worm
cut in two the water wa spurt up to a great distanc in all
direct a great portion of it swept over our raft and nearli blind
us but soon the end of the beast approach nearer and nearer hi
movement slacken visibl hi contort almost ceas and at last
the bodi of the mighti snake lai an inert dead mass on the surfac of
the now calm and placid water
as for the ichthyosauru ha he gone down to hi mighti cavern under
the sea to rest or will he reappear to destroi us
thi question remain unansw and we had breath time
chapter 31
the sea monster
wednesdai august 19th fortun the wind which for the present
blow with some violenc ha allow us to escap from the scene of the
unparallel and extraordinari struggl han with hi usual
imperturb calm remain at the helm my uncl who for a short time
had been withdrawn from hi absorb reveri by the novel incid of
thi sea fight fell back again appar into a brown studi hi ey
were fix impati on the widespread ocean
our voyag now becam monoton and uniform dull as it ha becom i
have no desir to have it broken by ani repetit of the peril and
adventur of yesterdai
thursdai august 20th the wind is now n n e and blow veri
irregularli it ha chang to fit gust the temperatur is
exceedingli high we ar now progress at the averag rate of about
ten mile and a half per hour
about twelv oclock a distant sound as of thunder fell upon our ear i
make a note of the fact without even ventur a suggest as to it
caus it wa on continu roar as of a sea fall over mighti rock
far off in the distanc said the professor dogmat there is
some rock or some island against which the sea lash to furi by the
wind is break violent
han without sai a word clamber to the top of the mast but could
make out noth the ocean wa level in everi direct as far as the
ey could reach
three hour pass awai without ani sign to indic what might be
befor us the sound began to assum that of a mighti cataract
i express my opinion on thi point strongli to my uncl he mere
shook hi head i howev am strongli impress by a convict that i
am not wrong ar we advanc toward some mighti waterfal which shall
cast us into the abyss probabl thi mode of descend into the abyss
mai be agreeabl to the professor becaus it would be someth like
the vertic descent he is so eager to make i entertain a veri
differ opinion
whatev be the truth it is certain that not mani leagu distant there
must be some veri extraordinari phenomenon for as we advanc the roar
becom someth mighti and stupend is it in the water or in the
air
i cast hasti glanc aloft at the suspend vapor and i seek to
penetr their mighti depth but the vault abov is tranquil the
cloud which ar now elev to the veri summit appear utterli still
and motionless and complet lost in the irradi of electr
light it is necessari therefor to seek for the caus of thi
phenomenon elsewher
i examin the horizon now perfectli calm pure and free from all haze
it aspect still remain unchang but if thi aw nois proce
from a cataractif so to speak in plain english thi vast interior
ocean is precipit into a lower basinif these tremend roar ar
produc by the nois of fall water the current would increas in
activ and it increas swift would give me some idea of the
extent of the peril with which we ar menac i consult the current it
simpli doe not exist there is no such thing an empti bottl cast into
the water li to leeward without motion
about four oclock han rise clamber up the mast and reach the
truck itself from thi elev posit hi look ar cast around
thei take in a vast circumfer of the ocean at last hi ey remain
fix hi face express no astonish but hi ey slightli dilat
he ha seen someth at last cri my uncl
i think so i repli
han came down stood besid us and point with hi right hand to the
south
der nere he said
there repli my uncl
and seiz hi telescop he look at it with great attent for
about a minut which to me appear an ag i knew not what to think or
expect
ye ye he cri in a tone of consider surpris there it is
what i ask
a tremend spurt of water rise out of the wave
some other marin monster i cri alreadi alarm
perhap
then let us steer more to the westward for we know what we have to
expect from antediluvian anim wa my eager repli
go ahead said my uncl
i turn toward han han wa at the tiller steer with hi usual
imperturb calm
nevertheless if from the distanc which separ us from thi
creatur a distanc which must be estim at not less than a dozen
leagu on could see the column of water spurt from the blowhol
of the great anim hi dimens must be someth preternatur to
fly is therefor the cours to be suggest by ordinari prudenc but
we have not come into that part of the world to be prudent such is my
uncl determin
we accordingli continu to advanc the nearer we come the loftier
is the spout water what monster can fill himself with such huge
volum of water and then unceasingli spout them out in such lofti
jet
at eight oclock in the even reckon as abov ground where there
is dai and night we ar not more than two leagu from the mighti
beast it long black enorm mountain bodi li on the top of
the water like an island but then sailor have been said to have gone
ashor on sleep whale mistak them for land is it illus or
is it fear it length cannot be less than a thousand fathom what
then is thi cetac monster of which no cuvier ever thought
it is quit motionless and present the appear of sleep the sea
seem unabl to lift him upward it is rather the wave which break on
hi huge and gigant frame the waterspout rise to a height of five
hundr feet break in sprai with a dull sullen roar
we advanc like senseless lunat toward thi mighti mass
i honestli confess that i wa abjectli afraid i declar that i would
go no farther i threaten in my terror to cut the sheet of the sail i
attack the professor with consider acrimoni call him
foolhardi mad i know not what he made no answer
suddenli the imperturb han onc more point hi finger to the
menac object
iholmei
an island cri my uncl
an island i repli shrug my shoulder at thi poor attempt at
decept
of cours it is cri my uncl burst into a loud and joyou
laugh
but the waterspout
geyser said han
ye of coursea geyser repli my uncl still laugh a geyser
like those common in iceland jet like thi ar the great wonder of
the countri
at first i would not allow that i had been so grossli deceiv what
could be more ridicul than to have taken an island for a marin
monster but kick as on mai on must yield to evid and i wa
final convinc of my error it wa noth after all but a natur
phenomenon
as we approach nearer and nearer the dimens of the liquid sheaf
of water becam truli grand and stupend the island had at a
distanc present the appear of an enorm whale whose head rose
high abov the water the geyser a word the iceland pronounc
geysir and which signifi furi rose majest from it summit
dull deton ar heard everi now and then and the enorm jet
taken as it were with sudden furi shake it plume of vapor and bound
into the first layer of the cloud it is alon neither spurt of vapor
nor hot spring surround it and the whole volcan power of that region
is concentr in on sublim column the rai of electr light mix
with thi dazzl sheaf everi drop as it fall assum the prismat
color of the rainbow
let us go on shore said the professor after some minut of silenc
it is necessari howev to take great precaut in order to avoid
the weight of fall water which would caus the raft to founder in
an instant han howev steer admir and bring us to the other
extrem of the island
i wa the first to leap on the rock my uncl follow while the
eiderduck hunter remain still like a man abov ani childish sourc
of astonish we were now walk on granit mix with silic
sandston the soil shiver under our feet like the side of boiler in
which overh steam is forcibl confin it is burn we soon
came in sight of the littl central basin from which rose the geyser i
plung a thermomet into the water which ran bubbl from the centr
and it mark a heat of a hundr and sixtythre degre
thi water therefor came from some place where the heat wa intens
thi wa singularli in contradict with the theori of professor
hardwigg i could not help tell him my opinion on the subject
well said he sharpli and what doe thi prove against my doctrin
noth repli i dryli see that i wa run my head against a
foregon conclus
nevertheless i am compel to confess that until now we have been most
remark fortun and that thi voyag is be accomplish in most
favor condit of temperatur but it appear evid in fact
certain that we shall sooner or later arriv at on of those region
where the central heat will reach it utmost limit and will go far
beyond all the possibl gradat of thermomet
vision of the hade of the ancient believ to be in the centr of
the earth float through my imagin
we shall howev see what we shall see that is the professor
favorit phrase now have christen the volcan island by the name
of hi nephew the leader of the expedit turn awai and gave the
signal for embark
i stood still howev for some minut gaze upon the magnific
geyser i soon wa abl to perceiv that the upward tendenc of the
water wa irregular now it diminish in intens and then suddenli
it regain new vigor which i attribut to the variat of the
pressur of the accumul vapor in it reservoir
at last we took our departur go carefulli round the project and
rather danger rock of the southern side han had taken advantag
of thi brief halt to repair the raft
befor we took our final departur from the island howev i made some
observ to calcul the distanc we had gone over and i put them
down in my journal sinc we left port gretchen we had travel two
hundr and seventi leaguesmor than eight hundr mileson thi
great inland sea we were therefor six hundr and twenti leagu
from iceland and exactli under england
chapter 32
the battl of the element
fridai august 21st thi morn the magnific geyser had wholli
disappear the wind had freshen up and we were fast leav the
neighborhood of henri island even the roar sound of the mighti
column wa lost to the ear
the weather if under the circumst we mai us such an express
is about to chang veri suddenli the atmospher is be gradual
load with vapor which carri with them the electr form by the
constant evapor of the salin water the cloud ar slowli but
sensibl fall toward the sea and ar assum a darkol textur
the electr rai can scarc pierc through the opaqu curtain which
ha fallen like a drop scene befor thi wondrou theater on the stage
of which anoth and terribl drama is soon to be enact thi time it
is no fight of anim it is the fear battl of the element
i feel that i am veri peculiarli influenc as all creatur ar on
land when a delug is about to take place
the cumuli a perfectli oval kind of cloud pile upon the south
present a most aw and sinist appear with the pitiless aspect
often seen befor a storm the air is extrem heavi the sea is
compar calm
in the distanc the cloud have assum the appear of enorm
ball of cotton or rather pod pile on abov the other in
picturesqu confus by degre thei appear to swell out break and
gain in number what thei lose in grandeur their heavi is so great
that thei ar unabl to lift themselv from the horizon but under the
influenc of the upper current of air thei ar gradual broken up
becom much darker and then present the appear of on singl layer
of a formid charact now and then a lighter cloud still lit up
from abov rebound upon thi grei carpet and is lost in the opaqu
mass
there can be no doubt that the entir atmospher is satur with
electr fluid i am myself wholli impregn my hair liter stand
on end as if under the influenc of a galvan batteri if on of my
companion ventur to touch me i think he would receiv rather a
violent and unpleas shock
about ten oclock in the morn the symptom of the storm becam more
thorough and decis the wind appear to soften down as if to take
breath for a renew attack the vast funer pall abov us look like
a huge baglik the cave of aeolu in which the storm wa collect
it forc for the attack
i tri all i could not to believ in the menac sign of the sky and
yet i could not avoid sai as it were involuntarili
i believ we ar go to have bad weather
the professor made me no answer he wa in a horribl in a detest
humorto see the ocean stretch intermin befor hi ey on
hear my word he simpli shrug hi shoulder
we shall have a tremend storm i said again point to the
horizon these cloud ar fall lower and lower upon the sea as if
to crush it
a great silenc prevail the wind wholli ceas natur assum a dead
calm and ceas to breath upon the mast where i notic a sort of
slight igni fatuu the sail hang in loos heavi fold the raft is
motionless in the midst of a dark heavi seawithout undul without
motion it is as still as glass but as we ar make no progress what
is the us of keep up the sail which mai be the caus of our
perdit if the tempest should suddenli strike us without warn
let us lower the sail i said it is onli an act of common prudenc
nono cri my uncl in an exasper tone a hundr time no
let the wind strike us and do it worst let the storm sweep us awai
where it willonli let me see the glimmer of some coastof some rocki
cliff even if thei dash our raft into a thousand piec no keep up
the sailno matter what happen
these word were scarc utter when the southern horizon underw a
sudden and violent chang the long accumul vapor were resolv
into water and the air requir to fill up the void produc becam a
wild and rage tempest
it came from the most distant corner of the mighti cavern it rage
from everi point of the compass it roar it yell it shriek with
glee as of demon let loos the dark increas and becam inde
dark visibl
the raft rose and fell with the storm and bound over the wave my
uncl wa cast headlong upon the deck i with great difficulti drag
myself toward him he wa hold on with might and main to the end of
a cabl and appear to gaze with pleasur and delight at the spectacl
of the unchain element
han never move a muscl hi long hair driven hither and thither by
the tempest and scatter wildli over hi motionless face gave him a
most extraordinari appearancefor everi singl hair wa illumin by
littl sparkl sprig
hi counten present the extraordinari appear of an antediluvian
man a true contemporari of the megatherium
still the mast hold good against the storm the sail spread out and
fill like a soap bubbl about to burst the raft rush on at a pace
imposs to estim but still less swiftli than the bodi of water
displac beneath it the rapid of which mai be seen by the line
which fly right and left in the wake
the sail the sail i cri make a trumpet of my hand and then
endeavor to lower it
let it alon said my uncl more exasper than ever
ineji said han gentli shake hi head
nevertheless the rain form a roar cataract befor thi horizon of
which we were in search and to which we were rush like madmen
but befor thi wilder of water reach us the mighti veil of
cloud wa torn in twain the sea began to foam wildli and the
electr produc by some vast and extraordinari chemic action in
the upper layer of cloud is brought into plai to the fear clap of
thunder ar ad dazzl flash of lightn such as i had never
seen the flash cross on anoth hurl from everi side while the
thunder came peal like an echo the mass of vapor becom
incandesc the hailston which strike the metal of our boot and our
weapon ar actual lumin the wave as thei rise appear to be
fireeat monster beneath which seeth an intens fire their
crest surmount by comb of flame
my ey ar dazzl blind by the intens of light my ear ar
deafen by the aw roar of the element i am compel to hold onto
the mast which bend like a reed beneath the violenc of the storm to
which none ever befor seen by marin bore ani resembl
here my travel note becom veri incomplet loos and vagu i have
onli been abl to make out on or two fugit observ jot down
in a mere mechan wai but even their breviti even their obscur
show the emot which overcam me
sundai august 23rd where have we got to in what region ar we
wander we ar still carri forward with inconceiv rapid
the night ha been fear someth not to be describ the storm
show no sign of cessat we exist in the midst of an uproar which
ha no name the deton as of artilleri ar incess our ear
liter bleed we ar unabl to exchang a word or hear each other
speak
the lightn never ceas to flash for a singl instant i can see the
zigzag after a rapid dart strike the arch roof of thi mightiest of
mighti vault if it were to give wai and fall upon us other lightn
plung their fork streak in everi direct and take the form of
globe of fire which explod like bombshel over a beleagu citi
the gener crash and roar do not appar increas it ha alreadi
gone far beyond what human ear can appreci if all the powder
magazin in the world were to explod togeth it would be imposs
for us to hear wors nois
there is a constant emiss of light from the storm cloud the
electr matter is incessantli releas evid the gaseou
principl of the air ar out of order innumer column of water
rush up like waterspout and fall back upon the surfac of the ocean in

whither ar we go my uncl still li at full length upon the raft
without speakingwithout take ani note of time
the heat increas i look at the thermomet to my surpris it
indicatesith exact figur is here rub out in my manuscripti
mondai august 24th thi terribl storm will never end why should not
thi state of the atmospher so dens and murki onc modifi again
remain definit
we ar utterli broken and harass by fatigu han remain just as
usual the raft run to the southeast invari we have now alreadi
run two hundr leagu from the newli discov island
about twelv oclock the storm becam wors than ever we ar oblig
now to fasten everi bit of cargo tightli on the deck of the raft or
everyth would be swept awai we make ourselv fast too each man
lash the other the wave drive over us so that sever time we ar
actual under water
we had been under the pain necess of abstain from speech for
three dai and three night we open our mouth we move our lip
but no sound came even when we place our mouth to each other ear

with a deep sigh he nod hi head and acquiesc
hi head had scarc time to fall back in the posit from which he
had momentarili rais it than a disk or ball of fire appear on the

ar carri awai bodili and i see them swept awai to a prodigi
height like a kite
we were frozen actual shiver with terror the ball of fire half
white half azurecolor about the size of a teninch bombshel move
along turn with prodigi rapid to leeward of the storm it ran
about here there and everywher it clamber up on of the bulwark
of the raft it leap upon the sack of provis and then final
descend lightli fell like a footbal and land on our powder barrel
horribl situat an explos of cours wa now inevit

chapter 33
our rout revers
here end what i call my journal of our voyag on board the raft
which journal wa happili save from the wreck i proce with my
narr as i did befor i commenc my daili note
what happen when the terribl shock took place when the raft wa cast
upon the rocki shore it would be imposs for me now to sai i felt
myself precipit violent into the boil wave and if i escap
from a certain and cruel death it wa wholli ow to the determin
of the faith han who clutch me by the arm save me from the
yawn abyss
the courag iceland then carri me in hi power arm far out
of the reach of the wave and laid me down upon a burn expans of
sand where i found myself some time afterward in the compani of my
uncl the professor
then he quietli return toward the fatal rock against which the
furiou wave were beat in order to save ani strai waif from the
wreck thi man wa alwai practic and thought i could not utter a
word i wa quit overcom with emot my whole bodi wa broken and
bruis with fatigu it took hour befor i wa anyth like myself
meanwhil there fell a fear delug of rain drench us to the
skin it veri violenc howev proclaim the approach end of the
storm some overhang rock afford us a slight protect from the
torrent
under thi shelter han prepar some food which howev i wa
unabl to touch and exhaust by the three weari dai and night of
watch we fell into a deep and pain sleep my dream were fear
but at last exhaust natur assert her supremaci and i slumber
next dai when i awok the chang wa magic the weather wa
magnific air and sea as if by mutual consent had regain their
seren everi trace of the storm even the faintest had disappear
i wa salut on my awaken by the first joyou tone i had heard from
the professor for mani a dai hi gaieti inde wa someth
terribl
well my lad he cri rub hi hand togeth have you slept
soundli
might it not have been suppos that we were in the old hous on the
konigstrass that i had just come down quietli to my breakfast and
that my marriag with gretchen wa to take place that veri dai my
uncl cool wa exasper
ala consid how the tempest had driven us in an easterli
direct we had pass under the whole of germani under the citi of
hamburg where i had been so happi under the veri street which contain
all i love and care for in the world
it wa a posit fact that i wa onli separ from her by a distanc
of forti leagu but these forti leagu were of hard impenetr
granit
all these dreari and miser reflect pass through my mind
befor i attempt to answer my uncl question
why what is the matter he cri cannot you sai whether you have
slept well or not
i have slept veri well wa my repli but everi bone in my bodi
ach i suppos that will lead to noth
noth at all my boi it is onli the result of the fatigu of the
last few daysthat is all
you appearif i mai be allow to sai soto be veri jolli thi
morn i said
delight my dear boi delight wa never happier in my life we
have at last reach the wishedfor port
the end of our expedit cri i in a tone of consider
surpris
no but to the confin of that sea which i began to fear would never
end but go round the whole world we will now tranquilli resum our
journei by land and onc again endeavor to dive into the centr of the
earth
my dear uncl i began in a hesit kind of wai allow me to ask
you on question
certainli harri a dozen if you think proper
on will suffic how about get back i ask
how about get back what a question to ask we have not as yet
reach the end of our journei
i know that all i want to know is how you propos we shall manag the
return voyag
in the most simpl manner in the world said the imperturb
professor onc we reach the exact centr of thi sphere either we
shall find a new road by which to ascend to the surfac or we shall
simpli turn round and go back by the wai we came i have everi reason to
believ that while we ar travel forward it will not close behind
us
then on of the first matter to see to will be to repair the raft
wa my rather melancholi respons
of cours we must attend to that abov all thing continu the
professor
then come the allimport question of provis i urg have we
anyth like enough left to enabl us to accomplish such great such
amaz design as you contempl carri out
i have seen into the matter and my answer is in the affirm han
is a veri clever fellow and i have reason to believ that he ha save
the greater part of the cargo but the best wai to satisfi your scrupl
is to come and judg for yourself
sai which he led the wai out of the kind of open grotto in which we
had taken shelter i had almost begun to hope that which i should rather
have fear and thi wa the imposs of such a shipwreck leav
even the slightest sign of what it had carri as freight i wa
howev thoroughli mistaken
as soon as i reach the shore of thi inland sea i found han
stand grave in the midst of a larg number of thing laid out in
complet order my uncl wrung hi hand with deep and silent gratitud
hi heart wa too full for speech
thi man whose superhuman devot to hi employ i not onli never
saw surpass nor even equal had been hard at work all the time we
slept and at the risk of hi life had succeed in save the most
preciou articl of our cargo
of cours under the circumst we necessarili experienc sever
sever loss our weapon had wholli vanish but experi had
taught us to do without them the provis of powder had howev
remain intact after have narrowli escap blow us all to atom
in the storm
well said the professor who wa now readi to make the best of
everyth as we have no gun all we have to do is to give up all
idea of hunt
ye my dear sir we can do without them but what about all our
instrument
here is the manomet the most us of all and which i gladli
accept in lieu of the rest with it alon i can calcul the depth as
we proce by it mean alon i shall be abl to decid when we have
reach the centr of the earth ha ha but for thi littl instrument
we might make a mistak and run the risk of come out at the
antipod
all thi wa said amid burst of unnatur laughter
but the compass i cri without that what can we do
here it is safe and sound he cri with real joi ah ah and here
we have the chronomet and the thermomet han the hunter is inde
an invalu man
it wa imposs to deni thi fact as far as the nautic and other
instrument were concern noth wa want then on further
examin i found ladder cord pickax crowbar and shovel
all scatter about on the shore
there wa howev final the most import question of all and that
wa provis
but what ar we to do for food i ask
let us see to the commissariat depart repli my uncl grave
the box which contain our suppli of food for the voyag were place
in a row along the strand and were in a capit state of preserv
the sea had in everi case respect their content and to sum up in on
sentenc take into consider biscuit salt meat schiedam and
dri fish we could still calcul on have about four month
suppli if us with prudenc and caution
four month cri the sanguin professor in high glee then we shall
have plenti of time both to go and to come and with what remain i
undertak to give a grand dinner to my colleagu of the johanneum
i sigh i should by thi time have becom us to the tempera of
my uncl and yet thi man astonish me more and more everi dai he wa
the greatest human enigma i ever had known
now he befor we do anyth els we must lai in a stock of fresh
water the rain ha fallen in abund and fill the hollow of the
granit there is a rich suppli of water and we have no fear of
suffer from thirst which in our circumst is of the last
import as for the raft i shall recommend han to repair it to the
best of hi abil though i have everi reason to believ we shall
not requir it again
how is that i cri more amaz than ever at my uncl style of
reason
i have an idea my dear boi it is none other than thi simpl fact we
shall not come out by the same open as that by which we enter
i began to look at my uncl with vagu suspicion an idea had more than
onc taken possess of me and thi wa that he wa go mad and
yet littl did i think how true and prophet hi word were doom to
be
and now he said have seen to all these matter of detail to
breakfast
i follow him to a sort of project cape after he had given hi last
instruct to our guid in thi origin posit with dri meat
biscuit and a delici cup of tea we made a satisfactori meali mai
sai on of the most welcom and pleasant i ever rememb exhaust
the keen atmospher the state of calm after so much agit all
contribut to give me an excel appetit inde it contribut
veri much to produc a pleasant and cheer state of mind
while breakfast wa in hand and between the sip of warm tea i ask
my uncl if he had ani idea of how we now stood in relat to the world
abov
for my part i ad i think it will be rather difficult to
determin
well if we were compel to fix the exact spot said my uncl it
might be difficult sinc dure the three dai of that aw tempest i
could keep no account either of the quick of our pace or of the
direct in which the raft wa go still we will endeavor to
approxim to the truth we shall not i believ be so veri far out
well if i recollect rightli i repli our last observ wa
made at the geyser island
harri island my boi harri island do not declin the honor of
have name it given your name to an island discov by us the
first human be who trod it sinc the creation of the world
let it be so then at harri island we had alreadi gone over two
hundr and seventi leagu of sea and we were i believ about six
hundr leagu more or less from iceland
good i am glad to see that you rememb so well let us start from
that point and let us count four dai of storm dure which our rate
of travel must have been veri great i should sai that our veloc
must have been about eighti leagu to the twentyfour hour
i agre that i thought thi a fair calcul there were then three
hundr leagu to be ad to the grand total
ye and the central sea must extend at least six hundr leagu from
side to side do you know my boi harri that we have discov an
inland lake larger than the mediterranean
certainli and we onli know of it extent in on wai it mai be
hundr of mile in length
veri like
then said i after calcul for some for some minut if your
previs ar right we ar at thi moment exactli under the
mediterranean itself
do you think so
ye i am almost certain of it ar we not nine hundr leagu distant
from reykjavik
that is perfectli true and a famou bit of road we have travel my
boi but why we should be under the mediterranean more than under turkei
or the atlant ocean can onli be known when we ar sure of not have
deviat from our cours and of thi we know noth
i do not think we were driven veri far from our cours the wind
appear to me to have been alwai about the same my opinion is that
thi shore must be situat to the southeast of port gretchen
goodi hope so it will howev be easi to decid the matter by
take the bear from our departur by mean of the compass come
along and we will consult that invalu invent
the professor now walk eagerli in the direct of the rock where the
indefatig han had place the instrument in safeti my uncl wa
gai and lightheart he rub hi hand and assum all sort of
attitud he wa to all appear onc more a young man sinc i had
known him never had he been so amiabl and pleasant i follow him
rather curiou to know whether i had made ani mistak in my estim
of our posit
as soon as we had reach the rock my uncl took the compass place it
horizont befor him and look keenli at the needl
as he had at first shaken it to give it vivac it oscil
consider and then slowli assum it right posit under the
influenc of the magnet power
the professor bent hi ey curious over the wondrou instrument a
violent start immedi show the extent of hi emot
he close hi ey rub them and took anoth and a keener survei
then he turn slowli round to me stupefact depict on hi
counten
what is the matter said i begin to be alarm
he could not speak he wa too overwhelm for word he simpli point
to the instrument
i examin it eagerli accord to hi mute direct and a loud cry
of surpris escap my lip the needl of the compass point due
northin the direct we expect wa the south
it point to the shore instead of to the high sea
i shook the compass i examin it with a curiou and anxiou ey it
wa in a state of perfect no blemish in ani wai explain the
phenomenon whatev posit we forc the needl into it return
invari to the same unexpect point
it wa useless attempt to conceal from ourselv the fatal truth
there could be no doubt about it unwelcom as wa the fact that dure
the tempest there had been a sudden slant of wind of which we had been
unabl to take ani account and thu the raft had carri us back to the
shore we had left appar forev so mani dai befor
chapter 34
a voyag of discoveri
it would be altogeth imposs for me to give ani idea of the utter
astonish which overcam the professor on make thi extraordinari
discoveri amaz incredul and rage were blend in such a wai
as to alarm me
dure the whole cours of my life i had never seen a man at first so
chapfallen and then so furious indign
the terribl fatigu of our sea voyag the fear danger we had
pass through had all all gone for noth we had to begin them all
over again
instead of progress as we fondli expect dure a voyag of so
mani dai we had retreat everi hour of our expedit on the raft
had been so much lost time
present howev the indomit energi of my uncl overcam everi
other consider
so he said between hi set teeth fatal will plai me these
terribl trick the element themselv conspir to overwhelm me with
mortif air fire and water combin their unit effort to
oppos my passag well thei shall see what the earnest will of a
determin man can do i will not yield i will not retreat even on
inch and we shall see who shall triumph in thi great contestman or
natur
stand upright on a rock irrit and menac professor hardwigg
like the feroci ajax seem to defi the fate i howev took upon
myself to interfer and to impos some sort of check upon such
insens enthusiasm
listen to me uncl i said in a firm but temper tone of voic
there must be some limit to ambit here below it is utterli useless
to struggl against the imposs prai listen to reason we ar
utterli unprepar for a sea voyag it is simpli mad to think of
perform a journei of five hundr leagu upon a wretch pile of
beam with a counterpan for a sail a paltri stick for a mast and a
tempest to contend with as we ar total incap of steer our
frail craft we shall becom the mere playth of the storm and it is
act the part of madmen if we a second time run ani risk upon thi
danger and treacher central sea
these ar onli a few of the reason and argument i put
togetherreason and argument which to me appear unanswer i wa
allow to go on without interrupt for about ten minut the
explan to thi i soon discov the professor wa not even
listen and did not hear a word of all my eloqu
to the raft he cri in a hoars voic when i paus for a repli
such wa the result of my strenuou effort to resist hi iron will i
tri again i beg and implor him i got into a passion but i had
to deal with a will more determin than my own i seem to feel like
the wave which fought and battl against the huge mass of granit at
our feet which had smile grimli for so mani ag at their puni
effort
han meanwhil without take part in our discuss had been
repair the raft on would have suppos that he instinct
guess at the further project of my uncl
by mean of some fragment of cordag he had again made the raft
seaworthi
while i had been speak he had hoist a new mast and sail the
latter alreadi flutter and wave in the breez
the worthi professor spoke a few word to our imperturb guid who
immedi began to put our baggag on board and to prepar for our
departur the atmospher wa now toler clear and pure and the
northeast wind blew steadili and seren it appear like to last
for some time
what then could i do could i undertak to resist the iron will of two
men it wa simpli imposs if even i could have hope for the support
of han thi howev wa out of the question it appear to me that
the iceland had set asid all person will and ident he wa a
pictur of abneg
i could hope for noth from on so infatu with and devot to hi
master all i could do therefor wa to swim with the stream
in a mood of stolid and sullen resign i wa about to take my
accustom place on the raft when my uncl place hi hand upon my
shoulder
there is no hurri my boi he said we shall not start until
tomorrow
i look the pictur of resign to the dire will of fate
under the circumst he said i ought to neglect no precaut
as fate ha cast me upon these shore i shall not leav without have
complet examin them
in order to understand thi remark i must explain that though we had
been driven back to the northern shore we had land at a veri
differ spot from that which had been our start point
port gretchen must we calcul be veri much to the westward
noth therefor wa more natur and reason than that we should
reconnoit thi new shore upon which we had so unexpectedli land
let us go on a journei of discoveri i cri
and leav han to hi import oper we start on our
expedit the distanc between the foreshor at high water and the
foot of the rock wa consider it would take about half an hour
walk to get from on to the other
as we trudg along our feet crush innumer shell of everi shape
and sizeonc the dwell place of anim of everi period of
creation
i particularli notic some enorm shellscarapac turtl and
tortois speci the diamet of which exceed fifteen feet
thei had in past ag belong to those gigant glyptodon of the
pliocen period of which the modern turtl is but a minut specimen in
addit the whole soil wa cover by a vast quantiti of stoni relic
have the appear of flint worn by the action of the wave and
ly in success layer on abov the other i came to the conclus
that in past ag the sea must have cover the whole district upon the
scatter rock now ly far beyond it reach the mighti wave of
ag had left evid mark of their passag
on reflect thi appear to me partial to explain the exist of
thi remark ocean forti leagu below the surfac of the earth
crust accord to my new and perhap fanci theori thi liquid
mass must be gradual lost in the deep bowel of the earth i had also
no doubt that thi mysteri sea wa fed by infiltr of the ocean
abov through impercept fissur
nevertheless it wa imposs not to admit that these fissur must
now be nearli choke up for if not the cavern or rather the immens
and stupend reservoir would have been complet fill in a short
space of time perhap even thi water have to contend against the
accumul subterran fire of the interior of the earth had becom
partial vapor henc the explan of those heavi cloud
suspend over our head and the superabund displai of that
electr which occas such terribl storm in thi deep and
cavern sea
thi lucid explan of the phenomena we had wit appear to me
quit satisfactori howev great and mighti the marvel of natur mai
seem to us thei ar alwai to be explain by physic reason
everyth is subordin to some great law of natur
it now appear clear that we were walk upon a kind of sedimentari
soil form like all the soil of that period so frequent on the
surfac of the globe by the subsid of the water the professor
who wa now in hi element carefulli examin everi rocki fissur let
him onli find an open and it directli becam import to him to
examin it depth
for a whole mile we follow the wind of the central sea when
suddenli an import chang took place in the aspect of the soil it
seem to have been rude cast up convulsion as it were by a
violent upheav of the lower strata in mani place hollow here and
hillock there attest great disloc at some other period of the
terrestri mass
we advanc with great difficulti over the broken mass of granit

discoveri upon discoveri
in order fulli to understand the exclam made by my uncl and hi
allus to these illustri and learn men it will be necessari to
enter into certain explan in regard to a circumst of the
highest import to paleontolog or the scienc of fossil life which
had taken place a short time befor our departur from the upper region
of the earth
on the 28th of march 1863 some navig under the direct of m
boucher de perth were at work in the great quarri of
moulinquignon near abbevil in the depart of the somm in
franc while at work thei unexpectedli came upon a human jawbon
buri fourteen feet below the surfac of the soil it wa the first
fossil of the kind that had ever been brought to the light of dai near
thi unexpect human relic were found stone hatchet and carv flint
color and cloth by time in on uniform brilliant tint of verdigri
the report of thi extraordinari and unexpect discoveri spread not
onli all over franc but over england and germani mani learn men
belong to variou scientif bodi and noteworthi among other
messr milneedward and de quatrefag took the affair veri much to
heart demonstr the incontest authent of the bone in
question and becameto us the phrase then recogn in englandth
most ardent support of the jawbon question
to the emin geologist of the unit kingdom who look upon the fact
as certainmessr falcon buck carpent and otherswer soon
unit the learn men of germani and among those in the first rank
the most eager the most enthusiast wa my worthi uncl professor
hardwigg
the authent of a human fossil of the quaternari period seem then
to be incontest demonstr and even to be admit by the most
skeptic
thi system or theori call it what you will had it is true a bitter
adversari in m eli de beaumont thi learn man who hold such a
high place in the scientif world hold that the soil of
moulinquignon doe not belong to the diluvium but to a much less
ancient stratum and in accord with cuvier in thi respect he
would by no mean admit that the human speci wa contemporari with the
anim of the quaternari epoch my worthi uncl professor hardwigg in
concert with the great major of geologist had held firm had
disput discuss and final after consider talk and
write m eli de beaumont had been pretti well left alon in hi
opinion
we were familiar with all the detail of thi discuss but were far
from be awar then that sinc our departur the matter had enter
upon a new phase other similar jawbon though belong to
individu of vari type and veri differ natur had been found
in the movabl grei sand of certain grotto in franc switzerland
and belgium togeth with arm utensil tool bone of children of
men in the prime of life and of old men the exist of men in the
quaternari period becam therefor more posit everi dai
but thi wa far from be all new remain dug up from the pliocen
or tertiari deposit had enabl the more farse or audaci among
learn men to assign even a far greater degre of antiqu to the
human race these remain it is true were not those of men that is
were not the bone of men but object decidedli have serv the human
race shinbon thighbon of fossil anim regularli scoop out
and in fact sculpturedbear the unmistak sign of human
handiwork
by mean of these wondrou and unexpect discoveri man ascend
endless centuri in the scale of time he in fact preced the
mastodon becam the contemporari of the ielepha meridionalisith
southern eleph acquir an antiqu of over a hundr thousand
year sinc that is the date given by the most emin geologist to
the pliocen period of the earth such wa then the state of
paleontolog scienc and what we moreov knew suffic to explain our
attitud befor thi great cemeteri of the plain of the hardwigg ocean
it will now be easi to understand the professor mingl astonish
and joi when on advanc about twenti yard he found himself in the
presenc of i mai sai face to face with a specimen of the human race
actual belong to the quaternari period
it wa inde a human skull perfectli recogniz had a soil of veri
peculiar natur like that of the cemeteri of st michel at bordeaux
preserv it dure countless ag thi wa the question i ask
myself but which i wa wholli unabl to answer but thi head with
stretch and parchmenti skin with the teeth whole the hair abund
wa befor our ey as in life
i stood mute almost paralyz with wonder and aw befor thi dread
apparit of anoth ag my uncl who on almost everi occas wa a
great talker remain for a time complet dumfound he wa too full
of emot for speech to be possibl after a while howev we rais
up the bodi to which the skull belong we stood it on end it seem
to our excit imagin to look at us with it terribl hollow
ey
after some minut of silenc the man wa vanquish by the professor
human instinct succumb to scientif pride and exult professor
hardwigg carri awai by hi enthusiasm forgot all the circumst
of our journei the extraordinari posit in which we were place the
immens cavern which stretch far awai over our head there can be no
doubt that he thought himself at the institut address hi
attent pupil for he put on hi most doctori style wave hi
hand and began
gentlemen i have the honor on thi auspici occas to present to
you a man of the quaternari period of our globe mani learn men have
deni hi veri exist while other abl person perhap of even
higher author have affirm their belief in the realiti of hi life
if the st thomas of paleontolog were present thei would
reverenti touch him with their finger and believ in hi exist
thu acknowledg their obstin heresi i know that scienc should be
care in relat to all discoveri of thi natur i am not without
have heard of the mani barnum and other quack who have made a trade
of suchlik pretend discoveri i have of cours heard of the
discoveri of the kneebon of ajax of the pretend find of the bodi
of orest by the spartiat and of the bodi of asteriu ten span
long fifteen feetof which we read in pausania
i have read everyth in relat to the skeleton of trapani
discov in the fourteenth centuri and which mani person chose to
regard as that of polyphemu and the histori of the giant dug up dure
the sixteenth centuri in the environ of palmyra you ar well awar as
i am gentlemen of the exist of the celebr analysi made near
lucern in 1577 of the great bone which the celebr doctor felix
plater declar belong to a giant about nineteen feet high i have
devour all the treatis of cassanion and all those memoir
pamphlet speech and repli publish in refer to the skeleton
of teutobochu king of the cimbri the invad of gaul dug out of a
gravel pit in dauphin in 1613 in the eighteenth centuri i should have
deni with peter campet the exist of the preadamit of
scheuchzer i have had in my hand the write call gigan
here my uncl wa afflict by the natur infirm which prevent him
from pronounc difficult word in public it wa not exactli
stutter but a strang sort of constitut hesit
the write name gigan he repeat
he howev could get no further
giganteo
imposs the unfortun word would not come out there would have
been great laughter at the institut had the mistak happen there
gigantosteolog at last exclaim professor hardwigg between two
savag growl
have got over our difficulti and get more and more excit
ye gentlemen i am well acquaint with all these matter and know
also that cuvier and blumenbach fulli recogn in these bone the
undeni remain of mammoth of the quaternari period but after what
we now see to allow a doubt is to insult scientif inquiri there is
the bodi you can see it you can touch it it is not a skeleton it is
a complet and uninjur bodi preserv with an anthropolog
object
i did not attempt to controvert thi singular and astound assert
if i could but wash thi corps in a solut of sulphur acid
continu my uncl i would undertak to remov all the earthi
particl and these resplend shell which ar incrust all over
thi bodi but i am without thi preciou dissolv medium
nevertheless such as it is thi bodi will tell it own histori
here the professor held up the fossil bodi and exhibit it with rare
dexter no profession showman could have shown more activ
as on examin you will see my uncl continu it is onli about
six feet in length which is a long wai from the pretend giant of
earli dai as to the particular race to which it belong it is
incontest caucasian it is of the white race that is of our own
the skull of thi fossil be is a perfect ovoid without ani remark
or promin develop of the cheekbon and without ani project
of the jaw it present no indic of the prognath which modifi
the facial angle4 measur the angl for yourselv and you will find
that it is just nineti degre but i will advanc still farther on the
road of inquiri and deduct and i dare ventur to sai that thi human
sampl or specimen belong to the japhet famili which spread over the
world from india to the uttermost limit of western europ there is no
occas gentlemen to smile at my remark
4 the facial angl is form by two planeson more or less vertic
which is in a straight line with the forehead and the incisor the
other horizont which pass through the organ of hear and the
lower nasal bone prognath in anthropolog languag mean that
particular project of the jaw which modifi the facial angl
of cours nobodi smile but the excel professor wa so accustom
to beam counten at hi lectur that he believ he saw all hi
audienc laugh dure the deliveri of hi learn dissert
ye he continu with renew anim thi is a fossil man a
contemporari of the mastodon with the bone of which thi whole
amphitheat is cover but if i am call on to explain how he came to
thi place how these variou strata by which he is cover have fallen
into thi vast caviti i can undertak to give you no explan
doubtless if we carri ourselv back to the quaternari epoch we shall
find that great and mighti convuls took place in the crust of the
earth the continu cool oper through which the earth had to
pass produc fissur landslip and chasm through which a larg
portion of the earth made it wai i come to no absolut conclus but
there is the man surround by the work of hi hand hi hatchet and
hi carv flint which belong to the stoni period and the onli
ration supposit is that like myself he visit the centr of the
earth as a travel tourist a pioneer of scienc at all event there
can be no doubt of hi great ag and of hi be on of the oldest
race of human be
the professor with these word ceas hi orat and i burst forth
into loud and unanim applaus besid after all my uncl wa
right much more learn men than hi nephew would have found it rather
hard to refut hi fact and argument
anoth circumst soon present itself thi fossil bodi wa not
the onli on in thi vast plain of bonesth cemeteri of an extinct
world other bodi were found as we trod the dusti plain and my uncl
wa abl to choos the most marvel of these specimen in order to
convinc the most incredul
in truth it wa a surpris spectacl the success remain of
gener and gener of men and anim confound togeth in
on vast cemeteri but a great question now present itself to our
notic and on we were actual afraid to contempl in all it
bear
had these onc anim be been buri so far beneath the soil by
some tremend convuls of natur after thei had been earth to earth
and ash to ash or had thei live here below in thi subterranean
world under thi factiti sky born marri and given in marriag
and di at last just like ordinari inhabit of the earth
up to the present moment marin monster fish and suchlik anim
had alon been seen aliv
the question which render us rather uneasi wa a pertin on were
ani of these men of the abyss wander about the desert shore of
thi wondrou sea of the centr of the earth
thi wa a question which render me veri uneasi and uncomfort
how should thei realli be in exist would thei receiv us men from
abov

what is it
for a long and weari hour we tramp over thi great bed of bone we
advanc regardless of everyth drawn on by ardent curios what
other marvel did thi great cavern containwhat other wondrou
treasur for the scientif man my ey were quit prepar for ani
number of surpris my imagin live in expect of someth
new and wonder
the border of the great central ocean had for some time disappear
behind the hill that were scatter over the ground occupi by the
plain of bone the imprud and enthusiast professor who did not
care whether he lost himself or not hurri me forward we advanc
silent bath in wave of electr fluid
by reason of a phenomenon which i cannot explain and thank to it
extrem diffus now complet the light illumin equal the side

all sign of vapor had disappear the rock the distant mountain
some confus mass of faroff forest assum a weird and mysteri
aspect under thi equal distribut of the lumin fluid
we resembl to a certain extent the mysteri personag in on of
hoffmann fantast talesth man who lost hi shadow
after we had walk about a mile farther we came to the edg of a vast

near port gretchen
it wa the gloriou and wild veget of the tertiari period in all

were without color and without perfum someth like paper discolor

my uncl ventur beneath the gigant grove i follow him though
not without a certain amount of apprehens sinc natur had shown
herself capabl of produc such stupend veget suppli why

suddenli i stop short and restrain my uncl
the extrem diffus of the light enabl me to see the smallest
object in the distant cops i thought i sawno i realli did see
with my own eyesimmens gigant anim move about under the
mighti tree ye thei were truli gigant anim a whole herd of
mastodon not fossil but live and exactli like those discov in
1801 on the marshi bank of the great ohio in north america
ye i could see these enorm eleph whose trunk were tear
down larg bough and work in and out the tree like a legion of
serpent i could hear the sound of the mighti tusk uproot huge
tree
the bough crackl and the whole mass of leav and green branch
went down the capaci throat of these terribl monster
that wondrou dream when i saw the antehistor time revivifi
when the tertiari and quaternari period pass befor me wa now
realiz
and there we were alon far down in the bowel of the earth at the

my uncl paus full of wonder and astonish
come he said at last when hi first surpris wa over come along
my boi and let us see them nearer
no repli i restrain hi effort to drag me forward we ar
wholli without arm what should we do in the midst of that flock of
gigant quadrup come awai uncl i implor you no human creatur
can with impun brave the feroci anger of these monster
no human creatur said my uncl suddenli lower hi voic to a

it seem to me that i behold a human beinga be like ourselvesa

we remain profoundli still speechless with surpris
but we might at ani moment be seen by him noth remain for us but
instant flight
come come i cri drag my uncl along and for the first time
he made no resist to my wish
a quarter of an hour later we were far awai from that terribl monster
now that i think of the matter calmli and that i reflect upon it

without take note of those who peopl the surfac without

i am rather inclin to admit the exist of some anim resembl in

like that discov by m lartet in the ossifer deposit of sansan

chapter 37
the mysteri dagger
dure thi time we had left the bright and transpar forest far
behind us we were mute with astonish overcom by a kind of feel
which wa next door to apathi we kept run in spite of ourselv it
wa a perfect right which resembl on of those horribl sensat we
sometim meet with in our dream
instinct we made our wai toward the central sea and i cannot now
tell what wild thought pass through my mind nor of what folli i
might have been guilti but for a veri seriou preoccup which
brought me back to practic life
though i wa awar that we were tread on a soil quit new to us i
howev everi now and then notic certain aggreg of rock the
shape of which forcibl remind me of those near port gretchen
thi confirm moreov the indic of the compass and our
extraordinari and unlookedfor as well as involuntari return to the
north of thi great central sea it wa so like our start point that
i could scarc doubt the realiti of our posit stream and cascad
fell in hundr over the numer project of the rock
i actual thought i could see our faith and monoton han and the
wonder grotto in which i had come back to life after my tremend
fall
then as we advanc still farther the posit of the cliff the
appear of a stream the unexpect profil of a rock threw me again
into a state of bewild doubt
after some time i explain my state of mental indecis to my uncl
he confess to a similar feel of hesit he wa total unabl
to make up hi mind in the midst of thi extraordinari but uniform
panorama
there can be no doubt i insist that we have not land exactli at
the place whenc we first took our departur but the tempest ha
brought us abov our start point i think therefor that if we
follow the coast we shall onc more find port gretchen
in that case cri my uncl it is useless to continu our
explor the veri best thing we can do is to make our wai back to
the raft ar you quit sure harri that you ar not mistaken
it is difficult wa my repli to come to ani decis for all these
rock ar exactli alik there is no mark differ between them at
the same time the impress on my mind is that i recogn the
promontori at the foot of which our worthi han construct the raft we
ar i am nearli convinc near the littl port if thi be not it i
ad carefulli examin a creek which appear singularli familiar to
my mind
my dear harryif thi were the case we should find trace of our own
footstep some sign of our passag and i can realli see noth to
indic our have pass thi wai
but i see someth i cri in an impetu tone of voic as i
rush forward and eagerli pick up someth which shone in the sand
under my feet
what is it cri the astonish and bewild professor
thi wa my repli
and i hand to my startl rel a rusti dagger of singular shape
what made you bring with you so useless a weapon he exclaim it
wa needlessli hamper yourself
i bring it it is quit new to me i never saw it beforear you sure
it is not out of your collect
not that i know of said the professor puzzl i have no
recollect of the circumst it wa never my properti
thi is veri extraordinari i said muse over the novel and singular
incid
not at all there is a veri simpl explan harri the iceland
ar known to keep up the us of these antiqu weapon and thi must
have belong to han who ha let it fall without know it
i shook my head that dagger had never been in the possess of the
pacif and taciturn han i knew him and hi habit too well
then what can it beunless it be the weapon of some antediluvian
warrior i continu of some live man a contemporari of that
mighti shepherd from whom we have just escap but nomysteri upon
mysterythi is no weapon of the stoni epoch nor even of the bronz
period it is made of excel steel
er i could finish my sentenc my uncl stop me short from enter
upon a whole train of theori and spoke in hi most cold and decid
tone of voic
calm yourself my dear boi and endeavor to us your reason thi
weapon upon which we have fallen so unexpectedli is a true idaguei
on of those worn by gentlemen in their belt dure the sixteenth
centuri it us wa to give the icoup de gracei the final blow to the
foe who would not surrend it is clearli of spanish workmanship it
belong neither to you nor to me nor the eiderdown hunter nor to ani
of the live be who mai still exist so marvel in the interior
of the earth
what can you mean uncl i said now lost in a host of surmis
look close at it he continu these jag edg were never made
by the resist of human blood and bone the blade is cover with a
regular coat of iron mold and rust which is not a dai old not a
year old not a centuri old but much more
the professor began to get quit excit accord to custom and wa
allow himself to be carri awai by hi fertil imagin i could
have said someth he stop me
harri he cri we ar now on the verg of a great discoveri thi
blade of a dagger you have so marvel discov after be
abandon upon the sand for more than a hundr two hundr even three
hundr year ha been indent by someon endeavor to carv an
inscript on these rock
but thi poniard never got here of itself i exclaim it could not
have twist itself someon therefor must have preced us upon the
shore of thi extraordinari sea
ye a man
but what man ha been suffici desper to do such a thing
a man who ha somewher written hi name with thi veri daggera man
who ha endeavor onc more to indic the right road to the interior
of the earth let us look around my boi you know not the import of
your singular and happi discoveri
prodigi interest we walk along the wall of rock examin the
smallest fissur which might final expand into the much wishedfor
gulli or shaft
we at last reach a spot where the shore becam extrem narrow the
sea almost bath the foot of the rock which were here veri lofti and
steep there wa scarc a path wider than two yard at ani point at
last under a huge overhang rock we discov the entranc of a
dark and gloomi tunnel
there on a squar tablet of granit which had been smooth by rub
it with anoth stone we could see two mysteri and much worn
letter the two initi of the bold and extraordinari travel who had
preced us on our adventur journei

chapter 38
no outletblast the rock
ever sinc the commenc of our marvel journei i had experienc
mani surpris had suffer from mani illus i thought that i wa
caseharden against all surpris and could neither see nor hear
anyth to amaz me again
i wa like a mani who have been round the world find himself wholli
blase and proof against the marvel
when howev i saw these two letter which had been engraven three
hundr year befor i stood fix in an attitud of mute surpris
not onli wa there the signatur of the learn and enterpris
alchemist written in the rock but i held in my hand the veri ident
instrument with which he had labori engrav it
it wa imposs without show an amount of incredul scarc
becom a sane man to deni the exist of the travel and the
realiti of that voyag which i believ all along to have been a
mythth mystif of some fertil brain
while these reflect were pass through my mind my uncl the
professor gave wai to an access of feverish and poetic excit
wonder and gloriou geniu great saknussemm he cri you have
left no stone unturn no resourc omit to show to other mortal
the wai into the interior of our mighti globe and your fellow creatur
can find the trail left by your illustri footstep three hundr
year ago at the bottom of these obscur subterranean abod you have
been care to secur for other the contempl of these wonder and
marvel of creation your name engrav at everi import stage of your
gloriou journei lead the hope travel direct to the great and
mighti discoveri to which you devot such energi and courag the
audaci travel who shall follow your footstep to the last will
doubtless find your initi engrav with your own hand upon the centr
of the earth i will be that audaci traveleri too will sign my
name upon the veri same spot upon the central granit stone of thi
wondrou work of the creator but in justic to your devot to your
courag and to your be the first to indic the road let thi
cape seen by you upon the shore of thi sea discov by you be
call of all time cape saknussemm
thi is what i heard and i began to be rous to the pitch of
enthusiasm indic by those word a fierc excit rous me i
forgot everyth the danger of the voyag and the peril of the
return journei were now as noth
what anoth man had done in ag past could i felt be done again i
wa determin to do it myself and now noth that man had
accomplish appear to me imposs
forwardforward i cri in a burst of genuin and hearti enthusiasm
i had alreadi start in the direct of the somber and gloomi galleri
when the professor stop me he the man so rash and hasti he the
man so easili rous to the highest pitch of enthusiasm check me and
ask me to be patient and show more calm
let us return to our good friend han he said we will then bring
the raft down to thi place
i must sai that though i at onc yield to my uncl request it wa
not without dissatisfact and i hasten along the rock of that
wonder coast
do you know my dear uncl i said as we walk along that we have
been singularli help by a concurr of circumst right up to
thi veri moment
so you begin to see it do you harri said the professor with a
smile
doubtless i respond and strang enough even the tempest ha
been the mean of put us on the right road bless on the
tempest it brought us safe back to the veri spot from which fine
weather would have driven us forev suppos we had succeed in
reach the southern and distant shore of thi extraordinari sea what
would have becom of us the name of saknussemm would never have
appear to us and at thi moment we should have been cast awai upon an
inhospit coast probabl without an outlet
ye harri my boi there is certainli someth providenti in that
wander at the merci of wind and wave toward the south we have come
back exactli north and what is better still we fall upon thi great
discoveri of cape saknussemm i mean to sai that it is more than
surpris there is someth in it which is far beyond my
comprehens the coincid is unheard of marvel
what matter it is not our duti to explain fact but to make the best
possibl us of them
doubtless my boi but if you will allow me said the realli
delight professor
excus me sir but i see exactli how it will be we shall take the
northern rout we shall pass under the northern region of europ
under sweden under russia under siberia and who know whereinstead
of buri ourselv under the burn plain and desert of africa or
beneath the mighti wave of the ocean and that is all at thi stage of
our journei that i care to know let us advanc and heaven will be our
guid
ye harri you ar right quit right all is for the best let us
abandon thi horizont sea which could never have led to anyth
satisfactori we shall descend descend and everlastingli descend do
you know my dear boi that to reach the interior of the earth we have
onli five thousand mile to travel
bah i cri carri awai by a burst of enthusiasm the distanc is
scarc worth speak about the thing is to make a start
my wild mad and incoher speech continu until we rejoin our
patient and phlegmat guid all wa we found prepar for an
immedi departur there wa not a singl parcel but what wa in it
proper place we all took up our post on the raft and the sail be
hoist han receiv hi direct and guid the frail bark toward
cape saknussemm as we had definit name it
the wind wa veri unfavor to a craft that wa unabl to sail close
to the wind it wa construct to go befor the blast we were
continu reduc to push ourselv forward by mean of pole on
sever occas the rock ran far out into deep water and we were
compel to make a long round at last after three long and weari
hour of navig that is to sai about six oclock in the even
we found a place at which we could land
i jump on shore first in my present state of excit and
enthusiasm i wa alwai first my uncl and the iceland follow the
voyag from the port to thi point of the sea had by no mean calm me
it had rather produc the opposit effect i even propos to burn our
vessel that is to destroi our raft in order to complet cut off our
retreat but my uncl sternli oppos thi wild project i began to
think him particularli lukewarm and unenthusiast
at ani rate my dear uncl i said let us start without delai
ye my boi i am quit as eager to do so as you can be but in the
first place let us examin thi mysteri galleri in order to find if
we shall need to prepar and mend our ladder
my uncl now began to see to the effici of our ruhmkorff coil which
would doubtless soon be need the raft secur fasten to a rock
wa left alon moreov the open into the new galleri wa not
twenti pace distant from the spot our littl troop with myself at the
head advanc
the orific which wa almost circular present a diamet of about
five feet the somber tunnel wa cut in the live rock and coat on
the insid by the differ materi which had onc pass through it in
a state of fusion the lower part wa about level with the water so
that we were abl to penetr to the interior without difficulti
we follow an almost horizont direct when at the end of about a
dozen pace our further advanc wa check by the interposit of an
enorm block of granit rock
accurs stone i cri furious on perceiv that we were stop
by what seem an insurmount obstacl
in vain we look to the right in vain we look to the left in vain
examin it abov and below there exist no passag no sign of ani
other tunnel i experienc the most bitter and pain disappoint
so enrag wa i that i would not admit the realiti of ani obstacl i
stoop to my knee i look under the mass of stone no hole no
interstic i then look abov the same barrier of granit han with
the lamp examin the side of the tunnel in everi direct
but all in vain it wa necessari to renounc all hope of pass
through
i had seat myself upon the ground my uncl walk angrili and
hopelessli up and down he wa evid desper
but i cri after some moment thought what about arn
saknussemm
you ar right repli my uncl he can never have been check by a
lump of rock
noten thousand time no i cri with extrem vivac thi huge
lump of rock in consequ of some singular concuss or process
on of those magnet phenomena which have so often shaken the
terrestri crust ha in some unexpect wai close up the passag
mani and mani year have pass awai sinc the return of saknussemm and
the fall of thi huge block of granit is it not quit evid that
thi galleri wa formerli the outlet for the pentup lava in the
interior of the earth and that these erupt matter then circul
freeli look at these recent fissur in the granit roof it is
evid form of piec of enorm stone place here as if by the
hand of a giant who had work to make a strong and substanti arch
on dai after an unusu strong shock the vast rock which stand in
our wai and which wa doubtless the kei of a kind of arch fell through
to a level with the soil and ha bar our further progress we ar
right then in think that thi is an unexpect obstacl with which
saknussemm did not meet and if we do not upset it in some wai we ar
unworthi of follow in the footstep of the great discover and
incap of find our wai to the centr of the earth
in thi wild wai i address my uncl the zeal of the professor hi
earnest long for success had becom part and parcel of my be i
wholli forgot the past i utterli despis the futur noth exist
for me upon the surfac of thi spheroid in the bosom of which i wa
engulf no town no countri no hamburg no koenigstrass not even
my poor gretchen who by thi time would believ me utterli lost in the
interior of the earth
well cri my uncl rous to enthusiasm by my word let us go to
work with pickax with crowbar with anyth that come to handbut
down with these terribl wall
it is far too tough and too big to be destroi by a pickax or
crowbar i repli
what then
as i said it is useless to think of overcom such a difficulti by
mean of ordinari tool
what then
what els but gunpowd a subterranean mine let us blow up the
obstacl that stand in our wai
gunpowd
ye all we have to do is to get rid of thi paltri obstacl
to work han to work cri the professor
the iceland went back to the raft and soon return with a huge
crowbar with which he began to dig a hole in the rock which wa to
serv as a mine it wa by no mean a slight task it wa necessari for
our purpos to make a caviti larg enough to hold fifti pound of
fulmin gun cotton the expans power of which is four time as
great as that of ordinari gunpowd
i had now rous myself to an almost miracul state of excit
while han wa at work i activ assist my uncl to prepar a long
wick made from damp gunpowd the mass of which we final enclos in
a bag of linen
we ar bound to go through i cri enthusiast
we ar bound to go through respond the professor tap me on the
back
at midnight our work as miner wa complet finish the charg of
fulmin cotton wa thrust into the hollow and the match which we
had made of consider length wa readi
a spark wa now suffici to ignit thi formid engin and to blow
the rock to atom
we will now rest until tomorrow
it wa absolut necessari to resign myself to my fate and to consent
to wait for the explos for six weari hour
chapter 39
the explos and it result
the next dai which wa the twentyseventh of august wa a date
celebr in our wondrou subterranean journei i never think of it
even now but i shudder with horror my heart beat wildli at the veri
memori of that aw dai
from thi time forward our reason our judgment our human ingenu
have noth to do with the cours of event we ar about to becom the
playth of the great phenomena of the earth
at six oclock we were all up and readi the dread moment wa arriv
when we were about to seek an open into the interior of the earth by
mean of gunpowd what would be the consequ of break through
the crust of the earth
i beg that it might be my duti to set fire to the mine i look upon
it as an honor thi task onc perform i could rejoin my friend upon
the raft which had not been unload as soon as we were all readi we
were to sail awai to some distanc to avoid the consequ of the
explos the effect of which would certainli not be concentr in
the interior of the earth
the slow match we calcul to burn for about ten minut more or
less befor it reach the chamber in which the great bodi of powder
wa confin i should therefor have plenti of time to reach the raft
and put off to a safe distanc
i prepar to execut my selfallot tasknot it must be confess
without consider emot
after a hearti repast my uncl and the hunterguid embark on board
the raft while i remain alon upon the desol shore
i wa provid with a lantern which wa to enabl me to set fire to the
wick of the infern machin
go my boi said my uncl and heaven be with you but come back as
soon as you can i shall be all impati
be easi on that matter i repli there is no fear of my delai on
the road
have said thi i advanc toward the open of the somber galleri
my heart beat wildli i open my lantern and seiz the extrem of
the wick
the professor who wa look on held hi chronomet in hi hand
ar you readi cri he
quit readi
well then fire awai
i hasten to put the light to the wick which crackl and sparkl
hiss and spit like a serpent then run as fast as i could i
return to the shore
get on board my lad and you han shove off cri my uncl
by a vigor applic of hi pole han sent us fly over the
water the raft wa quit twenti fathom distant
it wa a moment of palpit interest of deep anxieti my uncl the
professor never took hi ey off the chronomet
onli five minut more he said in a low tone onli four onli
three
my puls went a hundr to the minut i could hear my heart beat
onli two on now then mountain of granit crumbl beneath the
power of man
what happen after that as to the terrif roar of the explos i do
not think i heard it but the form of the rock complet chang in my
eyesthei seem to be drawn asid like a curtain i saw a fathomless
a bottomless abyss which yawn beneath the turgid wave the sea
which seem suddenli to have gone mad then becam on great
mountain mass upon the top of which the raft rose perpendicularli
we were all thrown down in less than a second the light gave place to
the most profound obscur then i felt all solid support give wai not
to my feet but to the raft itself i thought it wa go bodili down a
tremend well i tri to speak to question my uncl noth could
be heard but the roar of the mighti wave we clung togeth in utter
silenc
despit the aw dark despit the nois the surpris the
emot i thoroughli understood what had happen
beyond the rock which had been blown up there exist a mighti abyss
the explos had caus a kind of earthquak in thi soil broken by
fissur and rent the gulf thu suddenli thrown open wa about to
swallow the inland sea which transform into a mighti torrent wa
drag us with it
onli on idea fill my mind we were utterli and complet lost
on hour two hourswhat more i cannot sai pass in thi manner we
sat close togeth elbow touch elbow knee touch knee we held
on anoth hand not to be thrown off the raft we were subject to
the most violent shock whenev our sole depend a frail wooden
raft struck against the rocki side of the channel fortun for us
these concuss becam less and less frequent which made me fanci
that the galleri wa get wider and wider there could be now no
doubt that we had chanc upon the road onc follow by saknussemm but
instead of go down in a proper manner we had through our own
imprud drawn a whole sea with us
these idea present themselv to my mind in a veri vagu and obscur
manner i felt rather than reason i put my idea togeth onli
confusedli while spin along like a man go down a waterfal to
judg by the air which as it were whip my face we must have been
rush at a perfectli lightn rate
to attempt under these circumst to light a torch wa simpli
imposs and the last remain of our electr machin of our
ruhmkorff coil had been destroi dure the fear explos
i wa therefor veri much confus to see at last a bright light shine
close to me the calm counten of the guid seem to gleam upon me
the clever and patient hunter had succeed in light the lantern and
though in the keen and thorough draft the flame flicker and
vacil and wa nearli put out it serv partial to dissip the
aw obscur
the galleri into which we had enter wa veri wide i wa therefor
quit right in that part of my conjectur the insuffici light did
not allow us to see both of the wall at the same time the slope of
water which wa carri us awai wa far greater than that of the
most rapid river of america the whole surfac of the stream seem to
be compos of liquid arrow dart forward with extrem violenc and
power i can give no idea of the impress it made upon me
the raft at time caught in certain whirlpool and rush forward
yet turn on itself all the time how it did not upset i shall never be
abl to understand when it approach the side of the galleri i took
care to throw upon them the light of the lantern and i wa abl to
judg of the rapid of motion by look at the project mass of
rock which as soon as seen were again invis so rapid wa our
progress that point of rock at a consider distanc on from the
other appear like portion of transvers line which enclos us in a
kind of net like that of a line of telegraph wire
i believ we were now go at a rate of not less than a hundr mile
an hour
my uncl and i look at on anoth with wild and haggard ey we
clung convuls to the stump of the mast which at the moment when
the catastroph took place had snap short off we turn our back
as much as possibl to the wind in order not to be stifl by a
rapid of motion which noth human could face and live
and still the long monoton hour went on the situat did not
chang in the least though a discoveri i suddenli made seem to
complic it veri much
when we had slightli recov our equilibrium i proceed to examin
our cargo i then made the unsatisfactori discoveri that the greater
part of it had utterli disappear
i becam alarm and determin to discov what were our resourc my
heart beat at the idea but it wa absolut necessari to know on what
we had to depend with thi view i took the lantern and look around
of all our former collect of nautic and philosoph instrument
there remain onli the chronomet and the compass the ladder and
rope were reduc to a small piec of rope fasten to the stump of the
mast not a pickax not a crowbar not a hammer and far wors than
all no foodnot enough for on dai
thi discoveri wa a prelud to a certain and horribl death
seat gloomili on the raft clasp the stump of the mast
mechan i thought of all i had read as to suffer from
starvat
i rememb everyth that histori had taught me on the subject and i
shudder at the remembr of the agoni to be endur
madden at the prospect of endur the miseri of starvat i
persuad myself that i must be mistaken i examin the crack in the
raft i poke between the joint and beam i examin everi possibl
hole and corner the result wassimpli noth
our stock of provis consist of noth but a piec of dry meat and
some soak and halfmoldi biscuit
i gaze around me scare and frighten i could not understand the
aw truth and yet of what consequ wa it in regard to ani new
danger suppos that we had had provis for month and even for
year how could we ever get out of the aw abyss into which we were
be hurl by the irresist torrent we had let loos
why should we troubl ourselv about the suffer and tortur to be
endur from hunger when death stare us in the face under so mani other
swifter and perhap even more horrid form
it wa veri doubt under the circumst in which we were place
if we should have time to die of inanit
but the human frame is singularli constitut
i know not how it wa but from some singular hallucin of the
mind i forgot the real seriou and immedi danger to which we were
expos to think of the menac of the futur which appear befor us
in all their nake terror besid after all suggest hope perhap
we might final escap the furi of the rage torrent and onc more
revisit the glimps of the moon on the surfac of our beauti mother
earth
how wa it to be done i had not the remotest idea where were we to
come out no matter so that we did
on chanc in a thousand is alwai a chanc while death from hunger
gave us not even the faintest glimps of hope it left to the
imagin noth but blank horror without the faintest chanc of
escap
i had the greatest mind to reveal all to my uncl to explain to him the
extraordinari and wretch posit to which we were reduc in order
that between the two we might make a calcul as to the exact space
of time which remain for us to live
it wa it appear to me the onli thing to be done but i had the
courag to hold my tongu to gnaw at my entrail like the spartan boi
i wish to leav him all hi cool
at thi moment the light of the lantern slowli fell and at last went
out
the wick had wholli burnt to an end the obscur becam absolut it
wa no longer possibl to see through the impenetr dark there
wa on torch left but it wa imposs to keep it alight then like
a child i shut my ey that i might not see the dark
after a great laps of time the rapid of our journei increas i
could feel it by the rush of air upon my face the slope of the water
wa excess i began to feel that we were no longer go down a
slope we were fall i felt as on doe in a dream go down
bodilyfal fall fall
i felt that the hand of my uncl and han were vigor clasp my
arm
suddenli after a laps of time scarc appreci i felt someth
like a shock the raft had not struck a hard bodi but had suddenli been
check in it cours a waterspout a liquid column of water fell upon
us i felt suffoc i wa be drown
still the sudden inund did not last in a few second i felt myself
onc more abl to breath my uncl and han press my arm and the
raft carri us all three awai
chapter 40
the ap gigan
it is difficult for me to determin what wa the real time but i should
suppos by after calcul that it must have been ten at night
i lai in a stupor a half dream dure which i saw vision of
astound charact monster of the deep were side by side with the
mighti elephantin shepherd gigant fish and anim seem to form
strang conjunct
the raft took a sudden turn whirl round enter anoth tunnelthi
time illumin in a most singular manner the roof wa form of porou
stalactit through which a moonlit vapor appear to pass cast it
brilliant light upon our gaunt and haggard figur the light increas
as we advanc while the roof ascend until at last we were onc
more in a kind of water cavern the lofti dome of which disappear in a
lumin cloud
a rug cavern of small extent appear to offer a halt place to our
weari bodi
my uncl and the guid move as men in a dream i wa afraid to waken
them know the danger of such a sudden start i seat myself besid
them to watch
as i did so i becam awar of someth move in the distanc which
at onc fascin my ey it wa float appar upon the
surfac of the water advanc by mean of what at first appear
paddl i look with glare ey on glanc told me that it wa
someth monstrou
but what
it wa the great sharkcrocodil of the earli writer on geologi
about the size of an ordinari whale with hideou jaw and two gigant
ey it advanc it ey fix on me with terribl stern some
indefinit warn told me that it had mark me for it own
i attempt to riseto escap no matter where but my knee shook
under me my limb trembl violent i almost lost my sens and
still the mighti monster advanc my uncl and the guid made no effort
to save themselv
with a strang nois like none other i had ever heard the beast came
on hi jaw were at least seven feet apart and hi distend mouth
look larg enough to have swallow a boat of men
we were about ten feet distant when i discov that much as hi bodi
resembl that of a crocodil hi mouth wa wholli that of a shark
hi twofold natur now becam appar to snatch us up at a mouth it
wa necessari for him to turn on hi back which motion necessarili
caus hi leg to kick up helplessli in the air
i actual laugh even in the veri jaw of death
but next minut with a wild cry i dart awai into the interior of the
cave leav my unhappi comrad to their fate thi cavern wa deep
and dreari after about a hundr yard i paus and look around
the whole floor compos of sand and malachit wa strewn with bone
freshli gnaw bone of reptil and fish with a mixtur of mammalia
my veri soul grew sick as my bodi shudder with horror i had truli
accord to the old proverb fallen out of the fry pan into the
fire some beast larger and more feroci even than the sharkcrocodil
inhabit thi den
what could i do the mouth of the cave wa guard by on feroci
monster the interior wa inhabit by someth too hideou to
contempl flight wa imposs
onli on resourc remain and that wa to find some small hide place
to which the fear denizen of the cavern could not penetr i gaze
wildli around and at last discov a fissur in the rock to which i
rush in the hope of recov my scatter sens
crouch down i wait shiver as in an agu fit no man is brave in
presenc of an earthquak or a burst boiler or an explod
torpedo i could not be expect to feel much courag in presenc of the
fear fate that appear to await me
an hour pass i heard all the time a strang rumbl outsid the
cave
what wa the fate of my unhappi companion it wa imposs for me to
paus to inquir my own wretch exist wa all i could think of
suddenli a groan as of fifti bear in a fight fell upon my
earshiss spit moan hideou to hearand then i saw
never were ag to pass over my head shall i forget the horribl
apparit
it wa the ap gigan
fourteen feet high cover with coars hair of a blackish brown the
hair on the arm from the shoulder to the elbow joint point
downward while that from the wrist to the elbow point upward it
advanc it arm were as long as it bodi while it leg were
prodigi it had thick long and sharpli point teethlik a
mammoth saw
it struck it breast as it came on smell and snif remind me
of the stori we read in our earli childhood of giant who at the
flesh of men and littl boi
suddenli it stop my heart beat wildli for i wa consciou that
somehow or other the fear monster had smell me out and wa peer
about with hi hideou ey to try and discov my whereabout
my read which as a rule is a bless but which on thi occas
seem momentarili to prove a curs told me the real truth it wa the
ap gigan the antediluvian gorilla
ye thi aw monster confin by good fortun to the interior of the
earth wa the progenitor of the hideou monster of africa
he glare wildli about seek somethingdoubtless myself i gave
myself up for lost no hope of safeti or escap seem to remain
at thi moment just as my ey appear to close in death there came a
strang nois from the entranc of the cave and turn the gorilla
evid recogn some enemi more worthi hi prodigi size and
strength it wa the huge sharkcrocodil which perhap have dispos
of my friend wa come in search of further prei
the gorilla place himself on the defens and clutch a bone some
seven or eight feet in length a perfect club aim a deadli blow at
the hideou beast which rear upward and fell with all it weight
upon it adversari
a terribl combat the detail of which it is imposs to give now
ensu the struggl wa aw and feroci i howev did not wait
to wit the result regard myself as the object of content i
determin to remov from the presenc of the victor i slid down from
my hide place reach the ground and glide against the wall
strove to gain the open mouth of the cavern
but i had not taken mani step when the fear clamor ceas to be
follow by a mumbl and groan which appear to be indic of
victori
i look back and saw the huge ap gori with blood come after me
with glare ey with dilat nostril that gave forth two column of
heat vapor i could feel hi hot and fetid breath on my neck and with
a horrid jumpawok from my nightmar sleep
yesit wa all a dream i wa still on the raft with my uncl and the
guid
the relief wa not instantan for under the influenc of the hideou
nightmar my sens had becom numb after a while howev my
feel were tranquil the first of my percept which return
in full forc wa that of hear i listen with acut and attent
ear all wa still as death all i comprehend wa silenc to the
roar of the water which had fill the galleri with aw
reverber succeed perfect peac
after some littl time my uncl spoke in a low and scarc audibl
tone harri boi where ar you
i am here wa my faint rejoind
well dont you see what ha happen we ar go upward
my dear uncl what can you mean wa my halfdeliri repli
ye i tell you we ar ascend rapidli our downward journei is quit
check
i held out my hand and after some littl difficulti succeed in
touch the wall my hand wa in an instant cover with blood the
skin wa torn from the flesh we were ascend with extraordinari
rapid
the torchth torch cri the professor wildli it must be
light
han the guid after mani vain effort at last succeed in light
it and the flame have now noth to prevent it burn shed a
toler clear light we were enabl to form an approxim idea of
the truth
it is just as i thought said my uncl after a moment or two of
silent attent we ar in a narrow well about four fathom squar
the water of the great inland sea have reach the bottom of the
gulf ar now forc themselv up the mighti shaft as a natur
consequ we ar be cast upon the summit of the water
that i can see wa my lugubri repli but where will thi shaft
end and to what fall ar we like to be expos
of that i am as ignor as yourself all i know is that we should be
prepar for the worst we ar go up at a fearfulli rapid rate as
far as i can judg we ar ascend at the rate of two fathom a
second of a hundr and twenti fathom a minut or rather more than
three and a half leagu an hour at thi rate our fate will soon be a
matter of certainti
no doubt of it wa my repli the great concern i have now howev
is to know whether thi shaft ha ani issu it mai end in a granit
roofin which case we shall be suffoc by compress air or dash
to atom against the top i fanci alreadi that the air is begin to
be close and condens i have a difficulti in breath
thi might be fanci or it might be the effect of our rapid motion but
i certainli felt a great oppress of the chest
henri said the professor i do believ that the situat is to a
certain extent desper there remain howev mani chanc of
ultim safeti and i have in my own mind been revolv them over
dure your heavi but agit sleep i have come to thi logic
conclusionwherea we mai at ani moment perish so at ani moment we mai
be save we need therefor prepar ourselv for whatev mai turn up
in the great chapter of accid
but what would you have us do i cri ar we not utterli helpless
no while there is life there is hope at all event there is on
thing we can doeat and thu obtain strength to face victori or
death
as he spoke i look at my uncl with a haggard glanc i had put off
the fatal commun as long as possibl it wa now forc upon me
and i must tell him the truth
still i hesit
eat i said in a deprec tone as if there were no hurri
ye and at onc i feel like a starv prison he said rub
hi yellow and shiver hand togeth
and turn round to the guid he spoke some hearti cheer word
as i judg from hi tone in danish han shook hi head in a terribl
signific manner i tri to look unconcern
what cri the professor you do not mean to sai that all our
provis ar lost
ye wa my lowli spoken repli as i held out someth in my hand
thi morsel of dri meat is all that remain for us three
my uncl gaze at me as if he could not fulli appreci the mean of
my word the blow seem to stun him by it sever i allow him to
reflect for some moment
well said i after a short paus what do you think now is there
ani chanc of our escap from our horribl subterranean danger ar
we not doom to perish in the great hollow of the centr of the
earth
but my pertin question brought no answer my uncl either heard me
not or appear not to do so
and in thi wai a whole hour pass neither of us care to speak for
myself i began to feel the most fear and devour hunger my
companion doubtless felt the same horribl tortur but neither of
them would touch the wretch morsel of meat that remain it lai
there a last remnant of all our great prepar for the mad and
senseless journei
i look back with wonder to my own folli fulli wa i awar that
despit hi enthusiasm and the evertobeh scroll of saknussemm
my uncl should never have start on hi peril voyag what memori
of the happi past what previs of the horribl futur now fill my
brain
chapter 41
hunger
hunger prolong is temporari mad the brain is at work without
it requir food and the most fantast notion fill the mind
hitherto i had never known what hunger realli meant i wa like to
understand it now
and yet three month befor i could tell my terribl stori of
starvat as i thought it as a boi i us to make frequent excurs
in the neighborhood of the professor hous
my uncl alwai act on system and he believ that in addit to
the dai of rest and worship there should be a dai of recreat in
consequ i wa alwai free to do as i like on a wednesdai
now as i had a notion to combin the us and the agreeabl my
favorit pastim wa bird nest i had on of the best collect
of egg in all the town thei were classifi and under glass case
there wa a certain wood which by rise at earli morn and take the
cheap train i could reach at eleven in the morn here i would
botan or geolog at my will my uncl wa alwai glad of specimen
for hi herbarium and stone to examin when i had fill my wallet i
proceed to search for nest
after about two hour of hard work i on dai sat down by a stream to
eat my humbl but copiou lunch how the remembr of the spice
sausag the wheaten loaf and the beer made my mouth water now i
would have given everi prospect of worldli wealth for such a meal but
to my stori
while seat thu at my leisur i look up at the ruin of an old
castl at no great distanc it wa the remain of an histor
dwell ivyclad and now fall to piec
while look i saw two eagl circl about the summit of a lofti
tower i soon becam satisfi that there wa a nest now in all my
collect i lack egg of the nativ eagl and the larg owl
my mind wa made up i would reach the summit of that tower or perish
in the attempt i went nearer and survei the ruin the old
staircas year befor had fallen in the outer wall were howev
intact there wa no chanc that wai unless i look to the ivi sole
for support thi wa as i soon found out futil
there remain the chimnei which still went up to the top and had onc
serv to carri off the smoke from everi stori of the tower
up thi i determin to ventur it wa narrow rough and therefor the
more easili climb i took off my coat and crept into the chimnei
look up i saw a small light open proclaim the summit of the
chimnei
upup i went for some time us my hand and knee after the fashion
of a chimnei sweep it wa slow work but there be continu
project the task wa compar easi in thi wai i reach
halfwai the chimnei now becam narrow the atmospher wa close and
at last to end the matter i stuck fast i could ascend no higher
there could be no doubt of thi and there remain no resourc but to
descend and give up my gloriou prei in despair i yield to fate and
endeavor to descend but i could not move some unseen and mysteri
obstacl interven and stop me in an instant the full horror of my
situat seiz me
i wa unabl to move either wai and wa doom to a terribl and
horribl death that of starvat in a boi mind howev there is
an extraordinari amount of elast and hope and i began to think of
all sort of plan to escap my gloomi fate
in the first place i requir no food just at present have had an
excel meal and wa therefor allow time for reflect my first
thought wa to try and move the mortar with my hand had i possess a
knife someth might have been done but that us instrument i had
left in my coat pocket
i soon found that all effort of thi kind were vain and useless and
that all i could hope to do wa to wriggl downward
but though i jerk and struggl and strove to turn it wa all in
vain i could not move an inch on wai or the other and time flew
rapidli my earli rise probabl contribut to the fact that i felt
sleepi and gradual gave wai to the sensat of drowsi
i slept and awok in dark raven hungri
night had come and still i could not move i wa tight bound and did
not succe in chang my posit an inch i groan aloud never
sinc the dai of my happi childhood when it wa a hardship to go from
meal to meal without eat had i realli experienc hunger the
sensat wa as novel as it wa pain i began now to lose my head
and to scream and cry out in my agoni someth appear startl by
my nois it wa a harmless lizard but it appear to me a loathsom
reptil again i made the old ruin resound with my cri and final
so exhaust myself that i faint
how long i lai in a kind of tranc or sleep i cannot sai but when again
i recov conscious it wa dai how ill i felt how hunger still
gnaw at me it would be hard to sai i wa too weak to scream now far
too weak to struggl
suddenli i wa startl by a roar
ar you there henri said the voic of my uncl ar you there my
boi
i could onli faintli respond but i also made a desper effort to
turn some mortar fell to thi i ow my be discov when the
search took place it wa easili seen that mortar and small piec of
stone had recent fallen from abov henc my uncl cry
be calm he cri if we pull down the whole ruin you shall be
save
thei were delici word but i had littl hope
soon howev about a quarter of an hour later i heard a voic abov me
at on of the upper fireplac
ar you below or abov
below wa my repli
in an instant a basket wa lower with milk a biscuit and an egg my
uncl wa fear to be too readi with hi suppli of food i drank the
milk first for thirst had nearli deaden hunger i then much
refresh at my bread and hard egg
thei were now at work at the wall i could hear a pickax wish to
escap all danger from thi terribl weapon i made a desper struggl
and the belt which surround my waist and which had been hitch on a
stone gave wai i wa free and onli escap fall down by a rapid
motion of my hand and knee
in ten minut more i wa in my uncl arm after be two dai and
night in that horribl prison my occasion delirium prevent me from
count time
i wa week recov from that aw starvat adventur and yet
what wa that to the hideou suffer i now endur
after dream for some time and think of thi and other matter i
onc more look around me we were still ascend with fear
rapid everi now and then the air appear to check our respir
as it doe that of aeronaut when the ascens of the balloon is too
rapid but if thei feel a degre of cold in proport to the elev
thei attain in the atmospher we experienc quit a contrari effect
the heat began to increas in a most threaten and except manner
i cannot tell exactli the mean but i think it must have reach on
hundr twentytwo degre fahrenheit
what wa the mean of thi extraordinari chang in the temperatur as
far as we had hitherto gone fact had prove the theori of davi and
of lidenbrock to be correct until now all the peculiar condit of
refractori rock of electr of magnet had modifi the gener
law of natur and had creat for us a moder temperatur for the
theori of the central fire remain in my ey the onli explain
on
were we then go to reach a posit in which these phenomena were
to be carri out in all their rigor and in which the heat would reduc
the rock to a state of fusion
such wa my not unnatur fear and i did not conceal the fact from my
uncl my wai of do so might be cold and heartless but i could not
help it
if we ar not drown or smash into pancak and if we do not die
of starvat we have the satisfact of know that we must be
burn aliv
my uncl in presenc of thi brusqu attack simpli shrug hi
shoulder and resum hi reflectionswhatev thei might be
an hour pass awai and except that there wa a slight increas in the
temperatur no incid modifi the situat
my uncl at last of hi own accord broke silenc
well henri my boi he said in a cheer wai we must make up our
mind
make up our mind to what i ask in consider surpris
wellto someth we must at whatev risk recruit our physic
strength if we make the fatal mistak of husband our littl remnant
of food we mai probabl prolong our wretch exist a few hoursbut
we shall remain weak to the end
ye i growl to the end that howev will not keep us long
wait
well onli let a chanc of safeti present itselfonli allow that a
moment of action be necessarywher shall we find the mean of action
if we allow ourselv to be reduc to physic weak by inanit
when thi piec of meat is devour uncl what hope will there remain
unto us
none my dear henri none but will it do you ani good to devour it
with your ey you appear to me to reason like on without will or
decis like a be without energi
then cri i exasper to a degre which is scarc to be
explain you do not mean to tell methat youthat youhav not
lost all hope
certainli not repli the professor with consumm cool
you mean to tell me uncl that we shall get out of thi monstrou
subterranean shaft
while there is life there is hope i beg to assert henri that as long
as a man heart beat as long as a man flesh quiver i do not allow
that a be gift with thought and will can allow himself to despair
what a nerv the man place in a posit like that we occupi must
have been veri brave to speak like thi
well i cri what do you mean to do
eat what remain of the food we have in our hand let us swallow the
last crumb it will bel heaven will our last repast well never
mindinstead of be exhaust skeleton we shall be men
true mutter i in a despair tone let us take our fill
we must repli my uncl with a deep sigh call it what you will
my uncl took a piec of the meat that remain and some crust of
biscuit which had escap the wreck he divid the whole into three
part
each had on pound of food to last him as long as he remain in the
interior of the earth
each now act in accord with hi own privat charact
my uncl the professor at greedili but evid without appetit
eat simpli from some mechan motion i put the food insid my
lip and hungri as i wa chew my morsel without pleasur and
without satisfact
han the guid just as if he had been eiderdown hunt swallow
everi mouth as though it were a usual affair he look like a man
equal prepar to enjoi superflu or total want
han in all probabl wa no more us to starvat than ourselv
but hi hardi iceland natur had prepar him for mani suffer as
long as he receiv hi three rixdollar everi saturdai night he wa
prepar for anyth
the fact wa han never troubl himself about much except hi monei
he had undertaken to serv a certain man at so much per week and no
matter what evil befel hi employ or himself he never found fault
or grumbl so long as hi wage were duli paid
suddenli my uncl rous himself he had seen a smile on the face of our
guid i could not make it out
what is the matter said my uncl
schiedam said the guid produc a bottl of thi preciou fluid
we drank my uncl and myself will own to our dy dai that henc we
deriv strength to exist until the last bitter moment that preciou
bottl of holland wa in realiti onli half full but under the
circumst it wa nectar
it took some minut for myself and my uncl to form a decid opinion
on the subject the worthi professor swallow about half a pint and did
not seem abl to drink ani more
ifortraffligi said han swallow nearli all that wa left
excellentveri good said my uncl with as much gusto as if he had
just left the step of the club at hamburg
i had begun to feel as if there had been on gleam of hope now all
thought of the futur vanish
we had consum our last ounc of food and it wa five oclock in the
morn
chapter 42
the volcan shaft
man constitut is so peculiar that hi health is pure a neg
matter no sooner is the rage of hunger appeas than it becom
difficult to comprehend the mean of starvat it is onli when you
suffer that you realli understand
as to anyon who ha not endur privat have ani notion of the
matter it is simpli absurd
with us after a long fast some mouth of bread and meat a littl
moldi biscuit and salt beef triumph over all our previou gloomi and
saturnin thought
nevertheless after thi repast each gave wai to hi own reflect i
wonder what were those of hansth man of the extrem north who wa
yet gift with the fatalist resign of orient charact but
the utmost stretch of the imagin would not allow me to realiz the
truth as for my individu self my thought had ceas to be anyth
but memori of the past and were all connect with that upper world
which i never should have left i saw it all now the beauti hous in
the konigstrass my poor gretchen the good martha thei all pass
befor my mind like vision of the past everi time ani of the
lugubri groan which were to be distinguish in the hollow
around fell upon my ear i fanci i heard the distant murmur of the
great citi abov my head
as for my uncl alwai think of hi scienc he examin the natur
of the shaft by mean of a torch he close examin the differ
strata on abov the other in order to recogn hi situat by
geolog theori thi calcul or rather thi estim could by
no mean be anyth but approxim but a learn man a philosoph
is noth if not a philosoph when he keep hi idea calm and
collect and certainli the professor possess thi qualiti to
perfect
i heard him as i sat in silenc murmur word of geolog scienc
as i understood hi object and hi mean i could not but interest
myself despit my preoccup in that terribl hour
erupt granit he said to himself we ar still in the primit
epoch but we ar go upgo up still go up but who know who
know
then he still hope he felt along the vertic side of the shaft with
hi hand and some few minut later he would go on again in the
follow style
thi is gneiss thi is mica schistsilic miner good again
thi is the epoch of transit at all event we ar close to
themand then and then
what could the professor mean could he by ani conceiv mean
measur the thick of the crust of the earth suspend abov our
head did he possess ani possibl mean of make ani approxim to
thi calcul no
the manomet wa want and no summari estim could take the
place of it
and yet as we progress the temperatur increas in the most
extraordinari degre and i began to feel as if i were bath in a hot
and burn atmospher never befor had i felt anyth like it i
could onli compar it to the hot vapor from an iron foundri when the
liquid iron is in a state of ebullit and run over by degre and
on after the other han my uncl and myself had taken off our coat
and waistcoat thei were unbear even the slightest garment wa not
onli uncomfort but the caus of extrem suffer
ar we ascend to a live fire i cri when to my horror and
astonish the heat becam greater than befor
no no said my uncl it is simpli imposs quit imposs
and yet said i touch the side of the shaft with my nake hand
thi wall is liter burn
at thi moment feel as i did that the side of thi extraordinari
wall were red hot i plung my hand into the water to cool them i
drew them back with a cry of despair
the water is boil i cri
my uncl the professor made no repli other than a gestur of rage and
despair
someth veri like the truth had probabl struck hi imagin
but i could take no share in either what wa go on or in hi
specul an invinc dread had taken possess of my brain and
soul i could onli look forward to an immedi catastroph such a
catastroph as not even the most vivid imagin could have thought
of an idea at first vagu and uncertain wa gradual be chang
into certainti
i tremul reject it at first but it forc itself upon me by
degre with extrem obstinaci it wa so terribl an idea that i
scarc dare to whisper it to myself
and yet all the while certain and as it were involuntari observ
determin my convict by the doubt glare of the torch i could
make out some singular chang in the granit strata a strang and
terribl phenomenon wa about to be produc in which electr
plai a part
then thi boil water thi terribl and excess heat i determin
as a last resourc to examin the compass
the compass had gone mad
ye wholli stark stare mad the needl jump from pole to pole with
sudden and surpris jerk ran round or as it is said box the
compass and then ran suddenli back again as if it had the vertigo
i wa awar that accord to the best acknowledg theori it wa a
receiv notion that the miner crust of the globe is never and never
ha been in a state of complet repos
it is perpetu undergo the modif caus by the
decomposit of intern matter the agit consequ on the
flow of extens liquid current the excess action of magnet
which tend to shake it incessantli at a time when even the
multitudin be on it surfac do not suspect the seeth process
to be go on
still thi phenomenon would not have alarm me alon it would not have
arous in my mind a terribl an aw idea
but other fact could not allow my selfdelus to last
terribl deton like heaven artilleri began to multipli
themselv with fear intens i could onli compar them with the
nois made by hundr of heavili laden chariot be madli driven over
a stone pavement it wa a continu roll of heavi thunder
and then the mad compass shaken by the wild electr phenomena
confirm me in my rapidli form opinion the miner crust wa about
to burst the heavi granit mass were about to rejoin the fissur wa
about to close the void wa about to be fill up and we poor atom to
be crush in it aw embrac
uncl uncl i cri we ar wholli irretriev lost
what then my young friend is your new caus of terror and alarm he
said in hi calmest manner what fear you now
what do i fear now i cri in fierc and angri tone do you not see
that the wall of the shaft ar in motion do you not see that the solid
granit mass ar crack do you not feel the terribl torrid heat
do you not observ the aw boil water on which we float do you not
remark thi mad needl everi sign and portent of an aw earthquak
my uncl coolli shook hi head
an earthquak he repli in the most calm and provok tone
ye
my nephew i tell you that you ar utterli mistaken he continu
do you not can you not recogn all the wellknown symton
of an earthquak by no mean i am expect someth far more
import
my brain is strain beyond endurancewhat what do you mean i
cri
an erupt harri
an erupt i gasp we ar then in the volcan shaft of a
crater in full action and vigor
i have everi reason to think so said the professor in a smile tone
and i beg to tell you that it is the most fortun thing that could
happen to us
the most fortun thing had my uncl realli and truli gone mad what
did he mean by these aw wordswhat did he mean by thi terribl
calm thi solemn smile
what cri i in the height of my exasper we ar on the wai to
an erupt ar we fatal ha cast us into a well of burn and
boil lava of rock on fire of boil water in a word fill with
everi kind of erupt matter we ar about to be expel thrown up
vomit spit out of the interior of the earth in common with huge
block of granit with shower of cinder and scoria in a wild
whirlwind of flame and you sayth most fortun thing which could
happen to us
ye repli the professor look at me calmli from under hi
spectacl it is the onli chanc which remain to us of ever escap
from the interior of the earth to the light of dai
it is quit imposs that i can put on paper the thousand strang
wild thought which follow thi extraordinari announc
but my uncl wa right quit right and never had he appear to me so
audaci and so convinc as when he look me calmli in the face and
spoke of the chanc of an eruptionof our be cast upon mother earth
onc more through the gape crater of a volcano
nevertheless while we were speak we were still ascend we pass
the whole night go up or to speak more scientif in an
ascension motion the fear nois redoubl i wa readi to
suffoc i serious believ that my last hour wa approach and
yet so strang is imagin all i thought of wa some childish
hypothesi or other in such circumst you do not choos your own
thought thei overcom you
it wa quit evid that we were be cast upward by erupt matter
under the raft there wa a mass of boil water and under thi wa a
heavier mass of lava and an aggreg of rock which on reach the
summit of the water would be dispers in everi direct
that we were insid the chimnei of a volcano there could no longer be
the shadow of a doubt noth more terribl could be conceiv
but on thi occas instead of sneffel an old and extinct volcano
we were insid a mountain of fire in full activ sever time i
found myself ask what mountain wa it and on what part of the world
we should be shot out as if it were of ani consequ
in the northern region there could be no reason doubt about that
befor it went decidedli mad the compass had never made the slightest
mistak from the cape of saknussemm we had been swept awai to the
northward mani hundr of leagu now the question wa were we onc
more under icelandshould we be belch forth on to the earth through
the crater of mount hecla or should we reappear through on of the
other seven fire funnel of the island take in my mental vision a
radiu of five hundr leagu to the westward i could see under thi
parallel onli the littleknown volcano of the northwest coast of
america
to the east on onli exist somewher about the eightieth degre of
latitud the esk upon the island of jan mayen not far from the frozen
region of spitsbergen
it wa not crater that were want and mani of them were big enough
to vomit a whole armi all i wish to know wa the particular on
toward which we were make with such fear veloc
i often think now of my folli as if i should ever have expect to
escap
toward morn the ascend motion becam greater and greater if the
degre of heat increas instead of decreas as we approach the
surfac of the earth it wa simpli becaus the caus were local and
wholli due to volcan influenc our veri style of locomot left in
my mind no doubt upon the subject an enorm forc a forc of sever
hundr of atmospher produc by the vapor accumul and long
compress in the interior of the earth wa hoist us upward with
irresist power
but though we were approach the light of dai to what fear danger
were we about to be expos
instant death appear the onli fate which we could expect or
contempl
soon a dim sepulchr light penetr the vertic galleri which
becam wider and wider i could make out to the right and left long dark
corridor like immens tunnel from which aw and horrid vapor
pour out tongu of fire sparkl and crackl appear about to
lick us up
the hour had come
look uncl look i cri
well what you see ar the great sulphur flame noth more common
in connect with an erupt
but if thei lap us round i angrili repli
thei will not lap us round wa hi quiet and seren answer
but it will be all the same in the end if thei stifl us i cri
we shall not be stifl the galleri is rapidli becom wider and
wider and if it be necessari we will present leav the raft and take
refug in some fissur in the rock
but the water the water which is continu ascend i
despairingli repli
there is no longer ani water harri he answer but a kind of lava
past which is heav us up in compani with itself to the mouth of
the crater
in truth the liquid column of water had wholli disappear to give
place to dens mass of boil erupt matter the temperatur wa
becom utterli insupport and a thermomet expos to thi
atmospher would have mark between on hundr and eightynin and on
hundr nineti degre fahrenheit
perspir rush from everi pore but for the extraordinari rapid
of our ascent we should have been stifl
nevertheless the professor did not carri out hi proposit of
abandon the raft and he did quit wise those few illjoin beam
offer anywai a solid surfacea support which elsewher must have
utterli fail us
toward eight oclock in the morn a new incid startl us the
ascension movement suddenli ceas the raft becam still and
motionless
what is the matter now i said querul veri much startl by
thi chang
a simpl halt repli my uncl
is the erupt about to fail i ask
i hope not
without make ani repli i rose i tri to look around me perhap the
raft check by some project rock oppos a momentari resist to
the erupt mass in thi case it wa absolut necessari to releas
it as quickli as possibl
noth of the kind had occur the column of cinder of scoria of
broken rock and earth had wholli ceas to ascend
i tell you uncl that the erupt ha stop wa my oracular
decis
ah said my uncl you think so my boi you ar wrong do not be in
the least alarm thi sudden moment of calm will not last long be
assur it ha alreadi endur five minut and befor we ar mani
minut older we shall be continu our journei to the mouth of the
crater
all the time he wa speak the professor continu to consult hi
chronomet and he wa probabl right in hi prognost soon the raft
resum it motion in a veri rapid and disorderli wai which last two
minut or thereabout and then again it stop as suddenli as befor
good said my uncl observ the hour in ten we shall start
again
in ten minut
yesprecis we have to do with a volcano the erupt of which is
intermitt we ar compel to breath just as it doe
noth could be more true at the exact minut he had indic we
were again launch on high with extrem rapid not to be cast off
the raft it wa necessari to hold on to the beam then the hoist again
ceas
mani time sinc have i thought of thi singular phenomenon without
be abl to find for it ani satisfactori explan nevertheless it
appear quit clear to me that we were not in the princip chimnei of
the volcano but in an accessori conduit where we felt the counter
shock of the great and princip tunnel fill by burn lava
it is imposs for me to sai how mani time thi maneuv wa
repeat all that i can rememb is that on everi ascension motion
we were hoist up with ever increas veloc as if we had been
launch from a huge projectil dure the sudden halt we were nearli
stifl dure the moment of project the hot air took awai our
breath
i thought for a moment of the voluptu joi of suddenli find myself
in the hyperborean region with the cold thirti degre below zero
my exalt imagin pictur to itself the vast snowi plain of the
arctic region and i wa impati to roll myself on the ici carpet of
the north pole
by degre my head utterli overcom by a seri of violent emot
began to give wai to hallucin i wa deliri had it not been for
the power arm of han the guid i should have broken my head
against the granit mass of the shaft
i have in consequ kept no account of what follow for mani hour
i have a vagu and confus remembr of continu deton of the
shake of the huge granit mass and of the raft go round like a
spin top it float on the stream of hot lava amidst a fall
cloud of cinder the huge flame roar wrap us around
a storm of wind which appear to be cast forth from an immens
ventil rous up the interior fire of the earth it wa a hot
incandesc blast
at last i saw the figur of han as if envelop in the huge halo of
burn blaze and no other sens remain to me but that sinist dread
which the condemn victim mai be suppos to feel when led to the mouth
of a cannon at the suprem moment when the shot is fire and hi limb
ar dispers into empti space
chapter 43
daylight at last
when i open my ey i felt the hand of the guid clutch me firmli
by the belt with hi other hand he support my uncl i wa not
grievous wound but bruis all over in the most remark manner
after a moment i look around and found that i wa ly down on the
slope of a mountain not two yard from a yawn gulf into which i
should have fallen had i made the slightest fals step han had save
me from death while i roll insens on the flank of the crater
where ar we dreamili ask my uncl who liter appear to be
disgust at have return to earth
the eiderdown hunter simpli shrug hi shoulder as a mark of total
ignor
in iceland said i not posit but interrog
nej said han
how do you mean cri the professor nowhat ar your reason
han is wrong said i rise
after all the innumer surpris of thi journei a yet more singular
on wa reserv to us i expect to see a cone cover by snow by
extens and widespread glacier in the midst of the arid desert of
the extrem northern region beneath the full rai of a polar sky
beyond the highest latitud
but contrari to all our expect i my uncl and the iceland
were cast upon the slope of a mountain calcin by the burn rai of a
sun which wa liter bake us with it fire
i could not believ my ey but the actual heat which affect my bodi
allow me no chanc of doubt we came out of the crater half nake
and the radiant star from which we had ask noth for two month wa
good enough to be prodig to us of light and warmtha light and warmth
we could easili have dispens with
when our ey were accustom to the light we had lost sight of so long
i us them to rectifi the error of my imagin whatev happen
we should have been at spitsbergen and i wa in no humor to yield to
anyth but the most absolut proof
after some delai the professor spoke
hem he said in a hesit kind of wai it realli doe not look
like iceland
but suppos it were the island of jan mayen i ventur to observ
not in the least my boi thi is not on of the volcano of the
north with it hill of granit and it crown of snow
nevertheless
look look my boi said the professor as dogmat as usual
right abov our head at a great height open the crater of a volcano
from which escap from on quarter of an hour to the other with a
veri loud explos a lofti jet of flame mingl with pumic stone
cinder and lava i could feel the convuls of natur in the
mountain which breath like a huge whale throw up from time to
time fire and air through it enorm vent
below and float along a slope of consider angular the stream
of erupt matter spread awai to a depth which did not give the volcano
a height of three hundr fathom
it base disappear in a perfect forest of green tree among which i
perceiv oliv fig tree and vine load with rich grape
certainli thi wa not the ordinari aspect of the arctic region about
that there could not be the slightest doubt
when the ey wa satisfi at it glimps of thi verdant expans it
fell upon the water of a love sea or beauti lake which made of
thi enchant land an island of not mani leagu in extent
on the side of the rise sun wa to be seen a littl port crowd with
hous and near which the boat and vessel of peculiar build were
float upon azur wave
beyond group of island rose abov the liquid plain so numer and
close togeth as to resembl a vast beehiv
toward the set sun some distant shore were to be made out on the
edg of the horizon some present the appear of blue mountain of
harmoni conform upon other much more distant there appear
a prodigi lofti cone abov the summit of which hung dark and heavi
cloud
toward the north an immens expans of water sparkl beneath the
solar rai occasion allow the extrem of a mast or the
convex of a sail belli to the wind to be seen
the unexpect charact of such a scene ad a hundredfold to it
marvel beauti
where can we be i ask speak in a low and solemn voic
han shut hi ey with an air of indiffer and my uncl look on
without clearli understand
whatev thi mountain mai be he said at last i must confess it is
rather warm the explos do not leav off and i do not think it is
worthwhil to have left the interior of a volcano and remain here to
receiv a huge piec of rock upon on head let us carefulli descend
the mountain and discov the real state of the case to confess the
truth i am dy of hunger and thirst
decidedli the professor wa no longer a truli reflect charact for
myself forget all my necess ignor my fatigu and
suffer i should have remain still for sever hour longerbut
it wa necessari to follow my companion
the slope of the volcano wa veri steep and slipperi we slid over pile
of ash avoid the stream of hot lava which glide about like fieri
serpent still while we were advanc i spoke with extrem
volubl for my imagin wa too full not to explod in word
we ar in asia i exclaim we ar on the coast of india in the
great malai island in the centr of oceania we have cross the on
half of the globe to come out right at the antipod of europ
but the compass exclaim my uncl explain that to me
yesth compass i said with consider hesit i grant that
is a difficulti accord to it we have alwai been go northward
then it li
hemto sai it li is rather a harsh word wa my answer
then we ar at the north pole
the polenowellwel i give it up wa my repli
the plain truth wa that there wa no explan possibl i could
make noth of it
and all the while we were approach thi beauti verdur hunger and
thirst torment me fearfulli happili after two long hour march a
beauti countri spread out befor us cover by oliv pomegran
and vine which appear to belong to anybodi and everybodi in ani
event in the state of destitut into which we had fallen we were not
in a mood to ponder too scrupul
what delight it wa to press these delici fruit to our lip and to
bite at grape and pomegran fresh from the vine
not far off near some fresh and mossi grass under the delici shade
of some tree i discov a spring of fresh water in which we
voluptu lave our face hand and feet
while we were all give wai to the delight of newfound pleasur a
littl child appear between two tuft oliv tree
ah cri i an inhabit of thi happi countri
the littl fellow wa poorli dress weak and suffer and appear
terribl alarm at our appear halfnak with tangl mat and
rag beard we did look suprem illfavor and unless the countri
wa a bandit land we were not like to alarm the inhabit
just as the boi wa about to take to hi heel han ran after him and
brought him back despit hi cri and kick
my uncl tri to look as gentl as possibl and then spoke in german
what is the name of thi mountain my friend
the child made no repli
good said my uncl with a veri posit air of convict we ar
not in germani
he then made the same demand in english of which languag he wa an
excel scholar
the child shook it head and made no repli i began to be consider
puzzl
is he dumb cri the professor who wa rather proud of hi polyglot
knowledg of languag and made the same demand in french
the boi onli stare in hi face
i must perforc try him in italian said my uncl with a shrug
idov noi siamoi
ye tell me where we ar i ad impati and eagerli
again the boi remain silent
my fine fellow do you or do you not mean to speak cri my uncl
who began to get angri he shook him and spoke anoth dialect of the
italian languag
icom si noma questa isolaiwhat is the name of thi island
stromboli repli the ricketi littl shepherd dash awai from han
and disappear in the oliv grove
we thought littl enough about him
stromboli what effect on the imagin did these few word produc
we were in the centr of the mediterranean amidst the eastern
archipelago of mytholog memori in the ancient strongylo where
aeolu kept the wind and the tempest chain up and those blue
mountain which rose toward the rise sun were the mountain of
calabria
and that mighti volcano which rose on the southern horizon wa etna the
fierc and celebr etna
stromboli stromboli i repeat to myself
my uncl plai a regular accompani to my gestur and word we
were sing togeth like an ancient choru
ahwhat a journeywhat a marvel and extraordinari journei here we
had enter the earth by on volcano and we had come out by anoth
and thi other wa situat more than twelv hundr leagu from
sneffel from that drear countri of iceland cast awai on the confin of
the earth the wondrou chang of thi expedit had transport us to
the most harmoni and beauti of earthli land we had abandon the
region of etern snow for that of infinit verdur and had left over
our head the grai fog of the ici region to come back to the azur sky
of sicili
after a delici repast of fruit and fresh water we again continu
our journei in order to reach the port of stromboli to sai how we had
reach the island would scarc have been prudent the superstiti
charact of the italian would have been at work and we should have
been call demon vomit from the infern region it wa therefor
necessari to pass for humbl and unfortun shipwreck travel it
wa certainli less strike and romant but it wa decidedli safer
as we advanc i could hear my worthi uncl mutter to himself
but the compass the compass most certainli mark north thi is a
fact i cannot explain in ani wai
well the fact is said i with an air of disdain we must not
explain anyth it will be much more easi
i should like to see a professor of the johanneum institut who is
unabl to explain a cosmic phenomenonit would inde be strang
and speak thu my uncl halfnak hi leathern purs round hi
loin and hi spectacl upon hi nose becam onc more the terribl
professor of mineralog
an hour after leav the wood of oliv we reach the fort of san
vicenza where han demand the price of hi thirteenth week of
servic my uncl paid him with veri mani warm shake of the hand
at that moment if he did not inde quit share our natur emot he
allow hi feel so far to give wai as to indulg in an
extraordinari express for him
with the tip of two finger he gentli press our hand and smile
chapter 44
the journei end
thi is the final conclus of a narr which will be probabl
disbeliev even by peopl who ar astonish at noth i am howev
arm at all point against human incredul
we were kindli receiv by the strombolit fishermen who treat us as
shipwreck travel thei gave us cloth and food after a delai of
fortyeight hour on the 30th of septemb a littl vessel took us to
messina where a few dai of delight and complet repos restor us
to ourselv
on fridai the 4th of octob we embark in the volturn on of the
postal packet of the imperi messageri of franc and three dai
later we land at marseil have no other care on our mind but
that of our preciou but errat compass thi inexplic circumst
torment me terribl on the 9th of octob in the even we reach
hamburg
what wa the astonish of martha what the joi of gretchen i will
not attempt to defin it
now then harri that you realli ar a hero she said there is no
reason why you should ever leav me again
i look at her she wa weep tear of joi
i leav it to be imagin if the return of professor hardwigg made or
did not make a sensat in hamburg thank to the indiscret of
martha the new of hi departur for the interior of the earth had been
spread over the whole world
no on would believ itand when thei saw him come back in safeti thei
believ it all the less
but the presenc of han and mani strai scrap of inform by degre
modifi public opinion
then my uncl becam a great man and i the nephew of a great man which
at all event is someth hamburg gave a festiv in our honor a
public meet of the johanneum institut wa held at which the
professor relat the whole stori of hi adventur omit onli the
fact in connect with the compass
that same dai he deposit in the archiv of the town the document he
had found written by saknussemm and he express hi great regret that
circumst stronger than hi will did not allow him to follow the
iceland travel track into the veri centr of the earth he wa
modest in hi glori but hi reput onli increas
so much honor necessarili creat for him mani enviou enemi of
cours thei exist and as hi theori support by certain fact
contradict the system of scienc upon the question of central heat he
maintain hi own view both with pen and speech against the learn of
everi countri although i still believ in the theori of central heat i
confess that certain circumst hitherto veri ill defin mai
modifi the law of such natur phenomena
at the moment when these question were be discuss with interest
my uncl receiv a rude shockon that he felt veri much han
despit everyth he could sai to the contrari quit hamburg the
man to whom we ow so much would not allow us to pai our deep debt of
gratitud he wa taken with nostalgia a love for hi iceland home
farval said he on dai and with thi on short word of adieu he
start for reykjavik which he soon reach in safeti
we were deepli attach to our brave eiderduck hunter hi absenc will
never caus him to be forgotten by those whose live he save and i
hope at some not distant dai to see him again
to conclud i mai sai that our journei into the interior of the earth
creat an enorm sensat throughout the civil world it wa
translat and print in mani languag all the lead journal
publish extract from it which were comment discuss attack
and support with equal anim by those who believ in it
episod and by those who were utterli incredul
wonder my uncl enjoi dure hi lifetim all the glori he
deserv and he wa even offer a larg sum of monei by mr barnum
to exhibit himself in the unit state while i am credibl inform by
a travel that he is to be seen in waxwork at madam tussaud
but on care prei upon hi mind a care which render him veri
unhappi on fact remain inexplicablethat of the compass for a
learn man to be baffl by such an inexplic phenomenon wa veri
aggrav but heaven wa merci and in the end my uncl wa happi
on dai while he put some miner belong to hi collect in
order i fell upon the famou compass and examin it keenli
for six month it had lain unnot and untouch
i look at it with curios which soon becam surpris i gave a loud
cry the professor who wa at hand soon join me
what is the matter he cri
the compass
what then
why it needl point to the south and not to the north
my dear boi you must be dream
i am not dream seeth pole ar chang
chang
my uncl put on hi spectacl examin the instrument and leap with
joi shake the whole hous
a clear light fell upon our mind
here it is he cri as soon as he had recov the us of hi
speech after we had onc pass cape saknussemm the needl of thi
compass point to the southward instead of the northward
evid
our error is now easili explain but to what phenomenon do we ow
thi alter in the needl
noth more simpl
explain yourself my boi i am on thorn
dure the storm upon the central sea the ball of fire which made a
magnet of the iron in our raft turn our compass topsyturvi
ah cri the professor with a loud and ring laugh it wa a
trick of that inexplic electr
from that hour my uncl wa the happiest of learn men and i the
happiest of ordinari mortal for my pretti virland girl abdic her
posit as ward took her place in the hous in the konigstrass in the
doubl qualiti of niec and wife
