prefatori note
of thi work mr ruskin sai in hi autobiographyth idea had come
into my head in the summer of 37 and i imagin rose immedi out
of my sens of the contrast between the cottag of westmoreland and
those of itali anyhow the novemb number of loudon architectur
magazin for 1837 open with introduct to the poetri of
architectur or the architectur of the nation of europ consid in
it associ with natur sceneri and nation charact by kata
phusin i could not have put in fewer or more inclus word the
definit of what half my futur life wa to be spent in discours
of while the nomdeplum i chose accord to natur wa equal
express of the temper in which i wa to discours alik on that and
everi other subject the adopt of a nomdeplum at all impli as
also the conceal of name on the first public of modern
painter a sens of a power of judgment in myself which it would not
have been becom in a youth of eighteen to claim
as it is these youth essai though deform by assumpt and
shallow in content ar curious right up to the point thei reach
and alreadi distinguish abov most of the literatur of the time for
the skill of languag which the public at onc felt for a pleasant gift
in me prterita vol i chap 12
in a paper on my first editor written in 1878 mr ruskin sai of
these essai that thei contain sentenc nearli as well put togeth as
ani i have done sinc
the conductor of the architectur magazin in review the year
work said decemb 1838one seri of paper commenc in the
last volum and conclud in the present on we consid to be of
particular valu to the young architect we allud to the essai on the
poetri of architectur by kata phusin these essai will afford littl
pleasur to the mere builder or to the architect who ha no principl
of guidanc but preced but for such reader thei were never
intend thei ar address to the young and unprejud artist and
their great object is to induc him to think and to exercis hi
reason there ar some we trust of the rise gener who ar
abl to free themselv from the trammel and architectur bigotri of
vitruviu and hi follow and it is to such alon that we look
forward for ani real improv in architectur as an art of design and
tast
the essai ar in two part the first describ the cottag of
england franc switzerland and itali and give hint and direct
for picturesqu cottagebuild the second part treat of the villa
of itali and englandwith special refer to como and windermer and
conclud with a discuss of the law of artist composit and
practic suggest of interest to the builder of countryhous
it wa the author origin intent to have proceed from the
cottag and the villa to the higher form of architectur but the
magazin to which he contribut wa brought to a close shortli after
the complet of hi chapter on the villa and hi promis of farther
studi wa not redeem until ten year later by the public of
the seven lamp of architectur and still more complet in the
stone of venic
other paper contribut by mr ruskin to the same magazin on
perspect and on the propos monument to sir walter scott at
edinburgh ar not includ in thi volum as thei do not form ani part
of the seri on the poetri of architectur
the text is carefulli reprint from the architectur magazin a few
addit note ar distinguish by squar bracket
a few of the old cut necessari to the text ar reproduc and some
ar replac by engrav from sketch by the author possessor of
the architectur magazin vol v will be interest in compar
the woodcut of the cottag in val daosta p 104 of that volum with
the photogravur from the origin pencil draw which face p 21 of
thi work it is much to be regret that the origin of the coniston
hall fig 8 p 50 of thi work ha disappear and that the author
youth record of a scene so familiar to him in later year should be
repres onli by the harsh line of mr loudon engrav

introduct
1 the scienc of architectur follow out to it full extent is on
of the noblest of those which have refer onli to the creation of
human mind it is not mere a scienc of the rule and compass it doe
not consist onli in the observ of just rule or of fair proport
it is or ought to be a scienc of feel more than of rule a
ministri to the mind more than to the ey if we consid how much less
the beauti and majesti of a build depend upon it pleas certain
prejudic of the ey than upon it rous certain train of
medit in the mind it will show in a moment how mani intric
question of feel ar involv in the rais of an edific it will
convinc us of the truth of a proposit which might at first have
appear startl that no man can be an architect who is not a
metaphysician
2 to the illustr of the depart of thi nobl scienc which mai
be design the poetri of architectur thi and some futur articl
will be dedic it is thi peculiar of the art which constitut
it nation and it will be found as interest as it is us to
trace in the distinct charact of the architectur of nation not
onli it adapt to the situat and climat in which it ha arisen
but it strong similar to and connect with the prevail turn
of mind by which the nation who first emploi it is distinguish
3 i consid the task i have impos upon myself the more necessari
becaus thi depart of the scienc perhap regard by some who
have no idea beyond stone and mortar as chimer and by other who
think noth necessari but truth and proport as useless is at a
miser low ebb in england and what is the consequ we have
corinthian column place besid pilast of no order at all
surmount by monstrosifi pepperbox gothic in form and grecian in
detail in a build nomin and peculiarli nation we have swiss
cottag fals and calumni so entitl drop in the
brickfield round the metropoli and we have stare squarewindow
flatroof gentlemen seat of the lath and plaster
mockmagnific regent park descript rise on the woodi
promontori of derwentwat
4 how deepli is it to be regret how much is it to be wonder at
that in a countri whose school of paint though degrad by it
system of meretrici color and disgrac by host of wouldb
imit of inimit individu is yet rais by the distinguish
talent of those individu to a place of welldeserv honor and the
studio of whose sculptor ar fill with design of the most pure
simplic and most perfect anim the school of architectur
should be so miser debas
5 there ar howev mani reason for a fact so lament in the
first place the patron of architectur i am speak of all class
of build from the lowest to the highest ar a more numer and
less capabl class than those of paint the gener public and i sai
it with sorrow becaus i know it from observ have littl to do
with the encourag of the school of paint beyond the power which
thei unquestion possess and unmercifulli us of compel our
artist to substitut glare for beauti observ the direct of public
tast at ani of our exhibit we see visitor at that of the societi
of painter in water color pass tayler with anathema and lewi
with indiffer to remain in rever and admir befor certain
amiabl white lamb and waterlili whose artist shall be nameless
we see them in the royal academi pass by wilki turner and
callcott with shrug of doubt or of scorn to fix in gaze and
enthusiast crowd upon kettlesful of witch and hi majesti
ship so and so ly to in a gale etc etc but these pictur attain
no celebr becaus the public admir them for it is not to the public
that the judgment is intrust it is by the chosen few by our nobil
and men of tast and talent that the decis is made the fame
bestow and the artist encourag
6 not so in architectur there the power is gener diffus everi
citizen mai box himself up in as barbar a tenement as suit hi tast
or inclin the architect is hi vassal and must permit him not
onli to criticis but to perpetr the palac or the nobleman seat
mai be rais in good tast and becom the admir of a nation but
the influenc of their owner is termin by the boundari of hi
estat he ha no command over the adjac sceneri and the possessor
of everi thirti acr around him ha him at hi merci the street of
our citi ar exampl of the effect of thi clash of differ
tast and thei ar either remark for the utter absenc of all
attempt at embellish or disgrac by everi varieti of abomin
7 again in a climat like our those few who have knowledg and
feel to distinguish what is beauti ar frequent prevent by
variou circumst from erect it john bull comfort perpetu
interfer with hi good tast and i should be the first to lament hi
lose so much of hi nation as to permit the latter to prevail
he cannot put hi window into a recess without darken hi room he
cannot rais a narrow gabl abov hi wall without knock hi head
against the rafter and worst of all he cannot do either without
be stigmat by the aw inevit epithet of a veri odd man
but though much of the degrad of our present school of
architectur is ow to the want or the unfit of patron sure it
is yet more attribut to a lament defici of tast and talent
among our architect themselv it is true that in a countri afford
so littl encourag and present so mani caus for it absenc
it cannot be expect that we should have ani michael angelo
buonarotti the energi of our architect is expend in rais neat
poorhous and pretti chariti school and if thei ever enter upon
a work of higher rank economi is the order of the dai plaster and
stucco ar substitut for granit and marbl rod of splash iron for
column of verdantiqu and in the wild struggl after novelti the
fantast is mistaken for the grace the complic for the
impos superflu of ornament for beauti and it total absenc for
simplic
8 but all these disadvantag might in some degre be counteract all
these abus in some degre prevent were it not for the slight
attent paid by our architect to that branch of the art which i have
abov design as the poetri of architectur all uniti of feel
which is the first principl of good tast is neglect we see
noth but incongru combin we have pinnacl without height
window without light column with noth to sustain and buttress
with noth to support we have parish pauper smoke their pipe and
drink their beer under gothic arch and sculptur nich and quiet
old english gentlemen reclin on crocodil stool and peep out of
the window of swiss chlet
9 i shall attempt therefor to endeavor to illustr the principl
from the neglect of which these abus have arisen that of uniti of
feel the basi of all grace the essenc of all beauti we shall
consid the architectur of nation as it is influenc by their
feel and manner as it is connect with the sceneri in which it is
found and with the ski under which it wa erect we shall be led as
much to the street and the cottag as to the templ and the tower and
shall be more interest in build rais by feel than in those
correct by rule we shall commenc with the lower class of edific
proceed from the roadsid to the villag and from the villag to the
citi and if we succe in direct the attent of a singl
individu more directli to thi most interest depart of the

10 of all embellish by which the effort of man can enhanc the
beauti of natur sceneri those ar the most effect which can give
anim to the scene while the spirit which thei bestow is in unison
with it gener charact it is gener desir to indic the
presenc of anim exist in a scene of natur beauti but onli of
such exist as shall be imbu with the spirit and shall partak of
the essenc of the beauti which without it would be dead if our
object therefor is to embellish a scene the charact of which is
peac and unpretend we must not erect a build fit for the
abod of wealth or pride howev beauti or impos in itself such
an object immedi indic the presenc of a kind of exist
unsuit to the sceneri which it inhabit and of a mind which when it
sought retir wa unacquaint with it own rule feel and
which consequ excit no sympathi in our but if we erect a
dwell which mai appear adapt to the want and suffici for the
comfort of a gentl heart and lowli mind we have instantli attain
our object we have bestow anim but we have not disturb
repos
11 it is for thi reason that the cottag is on of the embellish
of natur sceneri which deserv attent consider it is
beauti alwai and everywher whether look out of the woodi
dingl with it eyelik window and send up the motion of azur
smoke between the silver trunk of ag tree or group among the
bright cornfield of the fruit plain or form grai cluster along
the slope of the mountain side the cottag alwai give the idea of a
thing to be belov a quiet lifegiv voic that is as peac as
silenc itself
12 with these feel we shall devot some time to the consider
of the prevail charact and nation peculiar of european
cottag the princip thing worthi of observ in the lowland
cottag of england is it finish neat the thatch is firmli peg
down and mathemat level at the edg and though the martin is
permit to attach hi humbl domicil in undisturb secur to the
eav he mai be consid as enhanc the effect of the cottag by
increas it us and make it contribut to the comfort of
more be than on the whitewash is stainless and it rough surfac
catch a side light as brightli as a front on the luxuri rose is
train gracefulli over the window and the gleam lattic divid
not into heavi squar but into small point diamond is thrown half
open as is just discov by it glanc among the green leav of the
sweetbrier to admit the breez that as it pass over the flower
becom full of their fragranc the light wooden porch break the flat
of the cottag face by it project and a branch or two of wander
honeysuckl spread over the low hatch a few squar feet of garden and a
latch wicket persuad the weari and dusti pedestrian with
express eloqu to lean upon it for an instant and request a drink
of water or milk complet a pictur which if it be far enough from
london to be unspoil by town sophist is a veri perfect thing
in it way1 the idea it awaken ar agreeabl and the architectur
is all that we want in such a situat it is pretti and appropri
and if it boast of ani other perfect it would be at the expens of
it proprieti

13 let us now cross the channel and endeavor to find a countri cottag
on the other side if we can for it is a difficult matter there ar
mani villag but such a thing as an isol cottag is extrem
rare let us try on or two of the green vallei among the chalk
emin which sweep from abbevil to rouen here is a cottag at
last and a picturesqu on which is more than we could sai for the
english domicil what then is the differ there is a gener air of
nonchal about the french peasant habit which is aid by a
perfect want of everyth like neat and render more conspicu
by some point about the build which have a look of neglect beauti
and obliter ornament half of the whitewash is worn off and the
other half color by variou moss and wander lichen which have
been permit to veget upon it and which though beauti
constitut a kind of beauti from which the idea of ag and decai ar
insepar the tall roof of the garret window stand fantast
out and underneath it where in england we had a plain doubl
lattic is a deep recess flatli arch at the top built of solid
mass of grai stone flute on the edg while the bright of the
glass within if there be ani is lost in shade caus the recess to
appear to the observ like a dark ey the door ha the same charact
it is also of stone which is so much broken and disguis as to prevent
it from give ani idea of strength or stabil the entranc is alwai
open no rose or anyth els ar wreath about it sever
outhous built in the same style give the build extent and the
group in all probabl the depend of some larg old chteau in
the distanc doe not peep out of cops or thicket or a group of tall
and beauti tree but stand comfortlessli between two individu
of the column of longtrunk facsimil elm which keep guard along
the length of the public road
14 now let it be observ how perfectli how singularli the
distinct charact of these two cottag agre with those of the
countri in which thei ar built and of the peopl for whose us thei
ar construct england is a countri whose everi scene is in
miniature2 it green vallei ar not wide it dewi hill ar not
high it forest ar of no extent or rather it ha noth that can
pretend to a more sound titl than that of wood it champaign ar
minut checker into field we can never see far at a time and
there is a sens of someth inexpress except by the truli english
word snug in everi quiet nook and shelter lane the english
cottag therefor is equal small equal shelter equal
invis at a distanc
footnot 2 compar with thi chapter modern painter vol iv
chap 1
15 but franc is a countri on a larg scale low but long hill sweep
awai for mile into vast uninterrupt champaign immens forest
shadow the countri for hundr of squar mile without onc let
through the light of dai it pastur and arabl land ar divid on
the same scale there ar no fenc we can hardli place ourselv in
ani spot where we shall not see for leagu around and there is a kind
of comfortless sublim in the size of everi scene the french cottag
therefor is on the same scale equal larg and desol look
but we shall see present that it can arous feel which though
thei cannot be said to give it sublim yet ar of a higher order than
ani which can be awaken at the sight of the english cottag
16 again everi bit of cultiv ground in england ha a finish
neat the field ar all divid by hedg or fenc the fruit
tree ar neatli prune the road beautifulli made etc everyth is
the revers in franc the field ar distinguish by the natur of the
crop thei bear the fruit tree ar overgrown with moss and mistleto
and the road immeasur wide and miser made
17 so much for the charact of the two cottag as thei assimil
with the countri in which thei ar found let us now see how thei
assimil with the charact of the peopl by whom thei ar built
england is a countri of perpetu increas prosper and activ
enterpris but for that veri reason noth is allow to remain till
it get old larg old tree ar cut down for timber old hous ar
pull down for the materi and old furnitur is laugh at and
neglect everyth is perpetu alter and renew by the activ
of invent and improv the cottag consequ ha no
dilapid look about it it is never suffer to get old it is us
as long as it is comfort and then taken down and rebuilt for it
wa origin rais in a style incap of resist the ravag of
time but in franc there prevail two opposit feel both in the
extrem that of the old pedigre popul which preserv
unlimitedli and that of the modern revolutionist which destroi
unmercifulli everi object ha partli the appear of have been
preserv with infinit care from an indefinit ag and partli exhibit
the evid of recent illtreat and disfigur primev forest
rear their vast trunk over those of mani younger gener grow up
besid them the chteau or the palac show by it style of
architectur it vener ag bear the mark of the cannonbal
and from neglect is wither into desol littl is renew
there is littl spirit of improv and the custom which prevail
centuri ago ar still taught by the patriarch of the famili to
their grandchildren the french cottag therefor is just such as we
should have expect from the disposit of it inhabit it
massiv window it broken ornament it whole air and appear all
tell the same tale of vener ag respect and preserv till at
last it dilapid wear an appear of neglect
18 again the englishman will sacrific everyth to comfort and
will not onli take great pain to secur it but he ha gener also
the power of do so for the english peasant is on the averag
wealthier than the french the french peasant ha no idea of comfort
and therefor make no effort to secur it the differ in the
charact of their inhabit is as we have seen written on the
front of their respect cottag the englishman is also fond of
displai but the ornament exterior and interior with which he adorn
hi dwell howev small it mai be ar either to show the extent of
hi possess or to contribut to some person profit or
gratif thei never seem design for the sake of ornament alon
thu hi wife love of displai is shown by the row of useless
crockeri in her cupboard and hi own by the rose tree at the front
door from which he mai obtain an earli bud to stick in the buttonhol
of hi best blue coat on sundai the honeysuckl is cultiv for it
smell the garden for it cabbag not so in franc there the meanest
peasant with an equal or greater love of displai embellish hi
dwell as much as li in hi power sole for the gratif of
hi feel of what is agreeabl to the ey the gabl of hi roof is
prettili shape the nich at it corner is richli carv the wooden
beam if there be ani ar fashion into grotesqu figur and even
the air nglig and gener dilapid of the build tell a
thousand time more agreeabl to an ey accustom to the picturesqu
than the spruce preserv of the english cottag
19 no build which we feel to excit a sentiment of mere complac
can be said to be in good tast on the contrari when the build is
of such a class that it can neither astonish by it beauti nor impress
by it sublim and when it is likewis place in a situat so
uninterest as to render someth more than mere fit or proprieti
necessari and to compel the ey to expect someth from the build
itself a gentl contrast of feel in that build is exceedingli
desir and if possibl a sens that someth ha pass awai the
presenc of which would have bestow a deeper interest on the whole
scene the fanci will immedi try to recov thi and in the
endeavor will obtain the desir effect from an indefinit caus
illustr fig 1 old window from an earli sketch by the author
20 now the french cottag cannot pleas by it proprieti for it can
onli be adapt to the ugli around and as it ought to be and
cannot but be adapt to thi it is still less abl to pleas by it
beauti how then can it pleas there is no pretens to gayeti in it
appear no green flowerpot in ornament lattic but the
substanti style of ani ornament it mai possess the recess window
the stone carv and the gener size of the whole unit to produc
an impress of the build have onc been fit for the resid of
prouder inhabit of it have onc possess strength which is now
wither and beauti which is now fade thi sens of someth lost
someth which ha been and is not is precis what is want the
imagin is set activ to work in an instant and we ar made awar
of the presenc of a beauti the more pleas becaus visionari and
while the ey is piti the actual humil of the present build
the mind is admir the imagin pride of the past everi mark of
dilapid increas thi feel while these veri mark the
fractur of the stone the lichen of the molder wall and the
grace line of the sink roof ar all delight in themselv
21 thu we have shown that while the english cottag is pretti from
it proprieti the french cottag have the same connect with it
climat countri and peopl produc such a contrast of feel as
bestow on it a beauti address itself to the mind and is therefor
in perfectli good tast if we ar ask why in thi instanc good
tast produc onli what everi travel feel to be not in the least
strike we repli that where the surround circumst ar
unfavor the veri adapt to them which we have declar to be
necessari render the build uninterest and that in the next
paper we shall see a veri differ result from the oper of
equal good tast in adapt a cottag to it situat in on of the
noblest district of europ our subject will be the lowland cottag of
north itali

the lowland cottageitali
most music most melancholi
22 let it not be thought that we ar unnecessarili detain our
reader from the propos subject if we premis a few remark on the
charact of the landscap of the countri we have now enter it will
alwai be necessari to obtain some definit knowledg of the distinct
featur of a countri befor we can form a just estim of the
beauti or the error of it architectur we wish our reader to imbu
themselv as far as mai be with the spirit of the clime which we ar
now enter to cast awai all gener idea to look onli for unison of
feel and to pronounc everyth wrong which is contrari to the
humor of natur we must make them feel where thei ar we must throw
a peculiar light and color over their imagin then we will bring
their judgment into plai for then it will be capabl of just oper
23 we have pass it must be observ in leav england and franc
for itali from comfort to desol from excit to sad we
have left on countri prosper in it prime and anoth frivol in
it ag for on gloriou in it death
now we have prefix the hacknei line of il penseroso to our paper
becaus it is a definit of the essenc of the beauti what is most
music will alwai be found most melancholi and no real beauti can be
obtain without a touch of sad whenev the beauti lose it
melancholi it degener into pretti we appeal to the memori of
all our observ reader whether thei have treasur up ani scene
pretend to be more than pretti which ha not about it either a ting
of melancholi or a sens of danger the on constitut the beauti
the other the sublim
24 thi postul be grant as we ar sure it will by most and we
beg to assur those who ar refractori or argument that were thi
a treatis on the sublim and beauti we could convinc and quell
their incredul to their entir satisfact by innumer
instanc we proce to remark here onc for all that the princip
glori of the italian landscap is it extrem melancholi it is fit
that it should be so the dead ar the nation of itali her name and
her strength ar dwell with the pale nation underneath the earth
the chief and chosen boast of her utmost pride is the hic jacet she
is but on wide sepulch and all her present life is like a shadow or
a memori and therefor or rather by a most beauti coincid
her nation tree is the cypress and whoever ha mark the peculiar
charact which these nobl shadowi spire can give to her landscap
lift their majest troop of wave dark from besid the fallen
column or out of the midst of the silenc of the shadow templ and
worshipless shrine seen far and wide over the blue of the faint plain
without love the dark tree for their sympathi with the sad of
itali sweet cemeteri shore is on who profan her soil with hi
footstep
25 everi part of the landscap is in unison the same glori of mourn
is thrown over the whole the deep blue of the heaven is mingl with
that of the everlast hill or melt awai into the silenc of the
sapphir sea the pale citi templ and tower lie gleam along the
champaign but how calmli no hum of men no motion of multitud in the
midst of them thei ar voiceless as the citi of ash the transpar
air is gentl among the blossom of the orang and the dim leav of the
oliv and the small fountain which in ani other land would spring
merrili along sparkl and sing among tinkl pebbl here flow
calmli and silent into some pale font of marbl all beauti with
life work by some unknown hand long ago nerveless and fall and
pass on among wan flower and scent cops through cool leaflight
cave or grai egerian grotto to join the tiber or eridanu to swell
the wave of nemi or the larian lake the most minut object leaf
flower and stone while thei add to the beauti seem to share in the
sad of the whole
26 but if on princip charact of italian landscap is melancholi
anoth is elev we have no simpl rustic of scene no cowslip
and buttercup humil of seclus tall mulberri tree with festoon
of the luxuri vine purpl with ponder cluster trail and
trellis between and over them shade the wide field of state indian
corn luxuri of lofti veget catalpa and alo and oliv
rang itself in line of massi light along the wan champaign guid
the ey awai to the unfail wall of mountain alp or apennin no cold
long rang of shiveri grai but dazzl light of snow or undul
breadth of blue fainter and darker in infinit varieti peak
precipic and promontori pass awai into the wood hill each with
it tower or white villag slope into the plain castel
battlement crest their undul some wide majest river glide
along the champaign the bridg on it breast and the citi on it
shore the whole canopi with cloudless azur bask in mistless
sunshin breath the silenc of odorifer air
27 now come the question in a countri of thi pomp of natur glori
temper with melancholi memori of depart pride what ar we to wish
for what ar we natur to expect in the charact of her most humbl
edific those which ar most connect with present lifeleast with
the past what ar we to consid fit or beauti in her cottag
we do not expect it to be comfort when everyth around it
betoken decai and desol in the work of man we do not wish it to
be neat where natur is most beauti becaus neglect but we
natur look for an elev of charact a rich of design or
form which while the build is kept a cottag mai yet give it a
peculiar air of cottag aristocraci a beauti no matter how
dilapid which mai appear to have been onc fit for the
surround splendor of scene and climat now let us fanci an italian
cottag befor us the reader who ha travel in itali will find littl
difficulti in recal on to hi memori with it broad line of light
and shadow and it strang but not unpleas mixtur of grandeur and
desol let us examin it detail enumer it architectur
peculiar and see how far it agre with our preconceiv idea of
what the cottag ought to be
28 the first remark point of the build is the roof it gener
consist of tile of veri deep curvatur which rib it into distinct
vertic line give it a far more agreeabl surfac than that of our
flatter tile the form of the roof howev is alwai excess
flat so as never to let it intrud upon the ey and the consequ
is that while an english villag seen at a distanc appear all red
roof the italian is all white wall and therefor though alwai
bright is never gaudi we have in these roof an excel exampl of
what should alwai be kept in mind that everyth will be found
beauti which climat or situat render us the strong and
constant heat of the italian sun would be intoler if admit at the
window and therefor the edg of the roof project far over the
wall and throw long shadow downward so as to keep the upper window
constantli cool these long obliqu shadow on the white surfac ar
alwai delight and ar alon suffici to give the build
charact thei ar peculiar to the build of spain and itali for
ow to the gener darker color of those of more northerli climat
the shadow of their roof howev far thrown do not tell distinctli
and render them not vari but gloomi anoth ornament us of these
shadow is that thei break the line of junction of the wall with the
roof a point alwai desir and in everi kind of build whether
we have to do with lead slate tile or thatch on of extrem
difficulti thi object is farther forward in the italian cottag by
put two or three window up under the veri eav themselv which
is also done for cool so that their top ar form by the roof
and the wall ha the appear of have been termin by larg
battlement and roof over and final the eav ar seldom kept
long on the same level doubl or trebl row of tile ar introduc
long stick and irregular woodwork ar occasion attach to them
to assist the festoon of the vine and the grace irregular and
mark charact of the whole must be dwelt on with equal delight by the
ey of the poet the artist or the unprejud architect all
howev is exceedingli humbl we have not yet met with the elev
of charact we expect we shall find it howev as we proce
29 the next point of interest is the window the modern italian is
complet owllik in hi habit all the daytim he li idl and
inert but dure the night he is all activ but it is mere activ
of inoccup idl partli induc by the temperatur of the
climat and partli consequ on the decai prosper of the nation
leav indic of it influenc on all hi undertak he prefer
patch up a ruin to build a hous he rais shop and hovel the
abod of inact veget brutish poverti under the protect of
ag and ruin yet stalwart arch of the roman amphitheat and the
habit of the lower order frequent present trace of ornament
and stabil of materi evid belong to the remain of a
prouder edific thi is the case sometim to such a degre as in
anoth countri would be disagre from it improprieti but in
itali it correspond with the gener promin of the featur of a
past ag and is alwai beauti thu the ey rest with delight on
the broken mold of the window and the sculptur capit of the
corner column contrast as thei ar the on with the glassless
black within the other with the rag and dirti confus of
draperi around the italian window in gener is a mere hole in the
thick wall alwai well proport occasion arch at the top
sometim with the addit of a littl rich ornament seldom if ever
have ani casement or glass but fill up with ani bit of stripe or
color cloth which mai have the slightest chanc of deceiv the
distant observ into the belief that it is a legitim blind thi
keep off the sun and allow a free circul of air which is the
great object when it is absent the window becom a mere black hole
have much the same relat to a glaze window that the hollow of a
skull ha to a bright ey not unexpress but frown and ghastli
and give a disagre impress of utter empti and desol
within yet there is charact in them the black dot tell agreeabl on
the wall at a distanc and have no disagre sparkl to disturb the
repos of surround sceneri besid the temperatur render
everyth agreeabl to the ey which give it an idea of ventil
a few roughli construct balconi project from detach window
usual break the uniform of the wall in some italian cottag there
ar wooden galleri resembl those so frequent seen in
switzerland but thi is not a veri gener charact except in the
mountain vallei of north itali although sometim a passag is
effect from on project portion of a hous to anoth by mean of
an exterior galleri these ar veri delight object and when shade
by luxuri vine which is frequent the case impart a grace
to the build otherwis unattain
30 the next strike point is the arcad at the base of the build
thi is gener in citi and although frequent want to the
cottag is present often enough to render it an import featur in
fact the italian cottag is usual found in group isol build
ar rare and the arcad afford an agreeabl if not necessari shade
in pass from on build to anoth it is a still more unfail
featur of the swiss citi where it is us in deep snow but the
support of the arch in switzerland ar gener squar mass of
wall vari in size separ the arch by irregular interv and
sustain by broad and massi buttress while in itali the arch
gener rest on legitim column vari in height from on and a
half to four diamet with huge capit not unfrequ rich in
detail these give great grace to the build in group thei
will be spoken of more at larg when we ar treat of arrang and
situat

31 the squar tower rise over the roof of the farther cottag will
not escap observ it ha been allow to remain not becaus such
elev build ever belong to mere cottag but first that the
truth of the scene might not be destroyed3 and secondli becaus it
is imposs or nearli so to obtain a group of build of ani sort
in itali without on or more such object rise behind them
beautifulli contribut to destroi the monotoni and contrast with the
horizont line of the flat roof and squar wall we think it right
therefor to give the cottag the relief and contrast which in
realiti it possess even though we ar at present speak of it in
the abstract
footnot 3 the annex illustr will perhap make the remark
advanc more intellig the build which is close to the citi of
aosta unit in itself all the peculiar for which the italian
cottag is remark the dark arcad the sculptur capit the
vinecov galleri the flat and confus roof and clearli exhibit
the point to which we wish particularli to direct attent name
bright of effect simplic of form and elev of charact
let it not be suppos howev that such a combin of attribut
is rare on the contrari it is common to the greater part of the
cottag of itali thi build ha not been select as a rare
exampl but it is given as a good on these remark refer to a cut in
the magazin text repres in the illustr edit by a
photogravur from the origin sketch
32 have now review the distinct part of the italian cottag in
detail we shall proce to direct our attent to point of gener
charact i simplic of form the roof be flat allow of no
project garret window no fantast gabl end the wall themselv
ar equal flat no bowwindow or sculptur oriel such as we meet
with perpetu in germani franc or the netherland vari their
white front now thi simplic is perhap the princip attribut
by which the italian cottag attain the elev of charact we
desir and expect all that is fantast in form or frivol in
detail annihil the aristocrat air of a build it at onc
destroi it sublim and size besid awaken as is almost alwai
the case associ of a mean and low charact the moment we see a
gabl roof we think of cockloft the instant we observ a project
window of attic and tentbedstead now the italian cottag assum
with the simplic lair nobl of build of a higher order and
though it avoid all ridicul miniatur mimicri of the palac it
discard the humbler attribut of the cottag the ornament it assum
is dignifi no grin face or unmean notch plank but
wellproport arch or tastefulli sculptur column while there
is noth about it unsuit to the humil of it inhabit there is
a gener digniti in it air which harmon beautifulli with the
nobil of the neighbor edific or the glori of the surround
sceneri
33 ii bright of effect there ar no weather stain on the wall
there is no damp in air or earth by which thei could be induc
the heat of the sun scorch awai all lichen and moss and moldi
veget no thatch or stone crop on the roof unit the build with
surround veget all is clear and warm and sharp on the ey
the more distant the build the more gener bright it becom
till the distant villag sparkl out of the orang cops or the
cypress grove with so much distinct as might be thought in some
degre objection but it must be rememb that the prevail
color of the italian landscap is blue sky hill water ar equal
azur the oliv which form a great proport of the veget is
not green but grai the cypress and it varieti dark and neutral
and the laurel and myrtl far from bright now white which is
intoler with green is agreeabl contrast with blue and to thi
caus it must be ascrib that the white of the italian build is not
found startl and disagre in the landscap that it is not we
believ will be gener allow
34 iii eleg of feel we never can prevent ourselv from
imagin that we perceiv in the grace neglig of the italian
cottag the evid of a tast among the lower order refin by the
glori of their land and the beauti of it remain we have alwai had
strong faith in the influenc of climat on the mind and feel strongli
tempt to discuss the subject at length but our paper ha alreadi
exceed it propos limit and we must content ourselv with
remark what will not we think be disput that the ey by
constantli rest either on natur sceneri of nobl tone and
charact or on the architectur remain of classic beauti must
contract a habit of feel correctli and tastefulli the influenc of
which we think is seen in the style of edific the most modern and
the most humbl
35 lastli dilapid we have just us the term grace
neglig whether it be grace or not is a matter of tast but
the uncomfort and ruinou disord and dilapid of the italian
cottag is on of observ the splendor of the climat requir
noth more than shade from the sun and occasion shelter from a
violent storm the outer arcad afford them both it becom the
nightli loung and daili dormitori of it inhabit and the interior
is abandon to filth and decai indol watch the tooth of time
with careless ey and nerveless hand religion or it abus reduc
everi individu of the popul to utter inact three dai out of
the seven and the habit form in the three regul the four abject
poverti take awai the power while brutish sloth weaken the will and
the filthi habit of the italian prevent him from suffer from the
state to which he is reduc the shatter roof the dark confus
rag window the obscur chamber the tatter and dirti draperi
altogeth present a pictur which seen too near is sometim
revolt to the ey alwai melancholi to the mind yet even thi mani
would not wish to be otherwis the prosper of nation as of
individu is cold and hardheart and forget the dead die
inde trampl down by the crowd of the live the place thereof
shall know them no more for that place is not in the heart of the
survivor for whose interest thei have made wai but advers and ruin
point to the sepulch and it is not trodden on to the chronicl and
it doth not decai who would substitut the rush of a new nation the
struggl of an awaken power for the dreami sleep of itali
desol for her sweet silenc of melancholi thought her twilight
time of everlast memori
36 such we think ar the princip distinct attribut of the
italian cottag let it not be thought that we ar wast time in the
contempl of it beauti even though thei ar of a kind which the
architect can never imit becaus he ha no command over time and no
choic of situat and which he ought not to imit if he could
becaus thei ar onli local desir or admir our object let it
alwai be rememb is not the attain of architectur data but
the format of tast

the mountain cottageswitzerland
37 in the three instanc of the lowland cottag which have been
alreadi consid ar includ the chief peculiar of style which
ar interest or import i have not it is true spoken of the
carv oaken gabl and shadowi roof of the norman villag of the black
cross rafter and fantast proport which delight the ey of the
german nor of the moorish arch and confus galleri which mingl so
magnific with the inimit fretwork of the grai templ of the
spaniard but these ar not peculiar sole belong to the
cottag thei ar found in build of a higher order and seldom
unless where thei ar combin with other featur thei ar therefor
rather to be consid in futur as element of street effect than
now as the peculiar of independ build my remark on the
italian cottag might inde be appli were it not for the constant
presenc of moorish feel to that of spain the architectur of the
two nation is intim connect modifi in itali by the tast of
the roman and in spain by the fanci creation of the moor when i
am consid the fortress and the palace4 i shall be compel to
devot a veri larg share of my attent to spain but for
characterist exampl of the cottag i turn rather to switzerland and
england preparatori therefor to a few gener remark on modern
ornament cottag it will be instruct to observ the peculiar
of two varieti of the mountain cottag diametr opposit to
each other in most of their featur on alwai beauti and the
other frequent so
footnot 4 that part howev wa not written as the architectur
magazin stop run soon after the conclus of part ii the

38 first for helvetia well do i rememb the thrill and exquisit
moment when first first in my life which had not been over long i
encount in a calm and shadowi dingl darken with the thick
spread of tall pine and voic with the sing of a
rockencumb stream and pass up toward the flank of a smooth
green mountain whose sward summit shone in the summer snow like an
emerald set in silver when i sai i first encount in thi calm
defil of the jura the unobtrus yet beauti front of the swiss
cottag i thought it the loveliest piec of architectur i had ever had
the felic of contempl yet it wa noth in itself noth but
a few mossi fir trunk loos nail togeth with on or two grai
stone on the roof but it power wa the power of associ it
beauti that of fit and humil
39 how differ is thi from what modern architect erect when thei
attempt to produc what is by courtesi call a swiss cottag the
modern build known in britain by that name ha veri long chimnei
cover with variou exceedingli ingeni devic for the conveni
recept and hospit entertain of soot suppos by the innoc

at an acut angl and termin in an interest and romant manner
at each extrem in a toothpick it wall ar veri precis and

two neat littl bow window support on neat littl mahogani bracket
full of neat littl squar of red and yellow glass it door is

on each side by a neat littl round tabl with all it leg of

veri peculiarli uncomfort and amazingli full of earwig the whole
be surround by a garden full of flint burnt brick and cinder
with some water in the middl and a fountain in the middl of it
which wont plai accompani by some goldfish which wont swim and
by two or three duck which will splash now i am excess sorri to
inform the member of ani respect english famili who ar make
themselv uncomfort in on of these ingeni concept under
the idea that thei ar live in a swiss cottag that thei labor under
a melancholi decept and shall now proce to investig the
peculiar of the real build
40 the life of a swiss peasant is divid into two period that in
which he is watch hi cattl at their summer pastur on the high
alps5 and that in which he seek shelter from the violenc of the
winter storm in the most retir part of the low vallei dure the
first period he requir onli occasion shelter from storm of
excess violenc dure the latter a suffici protect from
continu inclement weather the alpin or summer cottag therefor is
a rude log hut form of unsquar pine trunk notch into each other
at the corner the roof be excess flat so as to offer no
surfac to the wind is cover with fragment of ani stone that will
split easili held on by cross log which ar in their turn kept
down by mass of stone the whole be gener shelter behind some
protect rock or rest against the slope of the mountain so that
from on side you mai step upon the roof that is the chlet when

sens of a high mountain pastur not in it secondari sens of a

41 but the winter resid the swiss cottag properli socal is a
much more elabor piec of workmanship the princip requisit is of
cours strength and thi is alwai observ in the larg size of the
timber and the ingeni manner in which thei ar join so as to
support and reliev each other when ani of them ar sever tri
the roof is alwai veri flat gener meet at an angl of 155 and

thi project mai not be crush down by the enorm weight of snow

such ar the chief characterist of the swiss cottag separ
consid i must now take notic of it effect in sceneri
42 when on ha been wander for a whole morn through a vallei of
perfect silenc where everyth around which is motionless is
coloss and everyth which ha motion resistless where the
strength and the glori of natur ar princip develop in the veri
forc which feed upon her majesti and where in the midst of
mighti which seem imperish all that is inde etern is the
influenc of desol on is apt to be surpris and by no mean
agreeabl to find crouch behind some project rock a piec of
architectur which is neat in the extrem though in the midst of
wild weak in the midst of strength contempt in the midst of
immens there is someth offens in it neat for the wood is
almost alwai perfectli clean and look as if it had just been cut it
is consequ raw in it color and destitut of all varieti of tone
thi is especi disagre when the ey ha been previous
accustom to and find everywher around the exquisit mingl of
color and confus though perpetu grace form by which the
detail of mountain sceneri ar peculiarli distinguish everi fragment
of rock is finish in it effect tint with thousand of pale lichen
and fresh moss everi pine tree is warm with the life of variou
veget everi grassi bank glow with mellow color and wave
with delic leafag how then can the contrast be otherwis than
pain between thi perfect loveli and the dead raw lifeless
surfac of the deal board of the cottag it weak is pitiabl
for though there is alwai evid of consider strength on close
examin there is no effect of strength the real thick of the
log is conceal by the cut and carv of their expos surfac
and even what is seen is felt to be so utterli contempt when
oppos to the destruct forc which ar in oper around that
the feel ar irrit at the imagin audac of the inanim
object with the selfconceit of it impot and final the ey is
offend at it want of size it doe not as might be at first
suppos enhanc the sublim of surround sceneri by it
littl for it provok no comparison and there must be proport
between object or thei cannot be compar if the parthenon or the
pyramid of cheop or st peter were place in the same situat
the mind would first form a just estim of the magnific of the
build and then be trebli impress with the size of the mass which
overwhelm it the architectur would not lose and the crag would
gain by the juxtaposit but the cottag which must be felt to be a
thing which the weakest stream of the alp could toss down befor it
like a foamglob is offens contempt it is like a child toi
let fall accident on the hillsid it doe not unit with the scene
it is not content to sink into a quiet corner and personifi humil
and peac but it draw attent upon itself by it pretens to
decor while it decor themselv cannot bear examin
becaus thei ar useless unmean and incongru
43 so much for it fault and i have had no merci upon them the
rather becaus i am alwai afraid of be bias in it favor by my
excess love for it sweet nation now for it beauti wherev
it is found it alwai suggest idea of a gentl pure and pastor
life6 on feel that the peasant whose hand carv the plank so
neatli and adorn their cottag so industri and still preserv
it so perfectli and so neatli can be no dull drunken lazi boor on
feel also that it requir both firm resolut and determin
industri to maintain so success a struggl against the crush of
thunder and the war wind sweet idea float over the imagin
of such passag of peasant life as the gentl walton so love of the
full milkpail and the mantl creambowl of the even danc and
the matin song of the herdsmen on the alp of the maiden by the
fountain of all that is peculiarli and indisput swiss for the
cottag is beautifulli nation there is noth to be found the least
like it in ani other countri the moment a glimps is caught of it
project galleri on know that it is the land of tell and
winkelri and the travel feel that were he inde swissborn and
alpbr a bit of that carv plank meet hi ey in a foreign land
would be as effectu as a note of the ranz de vach upon the ear

44 again when a number of these cottag ar group togeth thei
break upon each other formal and form a mass of fantast
proport of carv window and overhang roof full of charact and
picturesqu in the extrem an excel exampl of thi is the bernes
villag of unterseen again when the ornament is not veri elabor
yet enough to preserv the charact and the cottag is old and not
veri well kept suppos in a cathol canton and a littl rotten the
effect is beauti the timber becom weatherstain and of a fine
warm brown harmon delightfulli with the grai stone on the roof
and the dark green of surround pine if it be fortun enough to be
situat in some quiet glen out of sight of the gigant featur of
the scene and surround with cliff to which it bear some proport
and if it be partial conceal not intrud on the ey but well
unit with everyth around it becom altogeth perfect humbl
beauti and interest perhap no cottag can then be found to
equal it and none can be more finish in effect grace in detail
and characterist as a whole
45 the ornament emploi in the decor of the swiss cottag do not
demand much attent thei ar usual form in a most simpl manner
by thin lath which ar carv into ani fanci form or in which row
of hole ar cut gener diamond shape and thei ar then nail on
abov anoth to give the carv depth pinnacl ar never rais on
the roof though carv spike ar occasion suspend from it at

46 of the adapt of the build to climat and charact littl
can be said when i call it nation i meant onli that it wa quit
sui generi and therefor be onli found in switzerland might be
consid as a nation build though it ha none of the mysteri
connect with the mind of it inhabit which is evid in all
realli fine edific but there is a reason for thi switzerland ha no
climat properli speak but an assemblag of everi climat from
itali to the pole the vine wild in it vallei the ic etern on it
crag the swiss themselv ar what we might have expect in person
dwell in such a climat thei have no charact the sluggish natur
of the air of the vallei ha a malign oper on the mind and
even the mountain though gener shrewd and intellectu have no
percept nation thei have no languag except a mixtur of
italian and bad german thei have no peculiar turn of mind thei might
be taken as easili for german as for swiss no correspond
consequ can exist between nation architectur and nation
charact where the latter is not distinguish gener speak
then the swiss cottag cannot be said to be built in good tast but it
is occasion picturesqu frequent pleas and under a favor
concurr of circumst beauti it is not howev a thing to
be imit it is alwai when out of it own countri incongru it
never harmon with anyth around it and can therefor be emploi
onli in mimicri of what doe not exist not in improv of what doe
i mean that ani on who ha on hi estat a dingl shade with larch
or pine with a rapid stream mai manufactur a bit of switzerland as a
toi but such imit ar alwai contempt and he cannot us the
swiss cottag in ani other wai a modifi form of it howev as will
be hereaft shown mai be emploi with advantag i hope in my next
paper to deriv more satisfact from the contempl of the
mountain cottag of westmoreland than i have been abl to obtain from
that of the swiss
iv
the mountain cottagewestmoreland
47 when i devot so much time to the consider of the
peculiar of the swiss cottag i did not previous endeavor to
ascertain what the mind influenc by the feel excit by the
natur of it situat would be induc to expect or dispos to
admir i thu deviat from the gener rule which i hope to be abl to
follow out but i did so onli becaus the subject for consider wa
incap of fulfil the expect when excit or correspond
with the concept when form but now in order to appreci the
beauti of the westmoreland cottag it will be necessari to fix upon a
standard of excel with which it mai be compar
on of the princip charm of mountain sceneri is it solitud now
just as silenc is never perfect or deep without motion solitud is
never perfect without some vestig of life even desol is not felt
to be utter unless in some slight degre interrupt unless the
cricket is chirp on the lone hearth or the vultur soar over
the field of corps or the on mourner lament over the red ruin of
the devast villag that devast is not felt to be complet the
anathema of the prophet doe not wholli leav the curs of loneli
upon the mighti citi until he tell us that the satyr shall danc
there and if desol which is the destruct of life cannot
leav it impress perfect without some interrupt much less can
solitud which is onli the absenc of life be felt without some
contrast accordingli it is perhap never so perfect as when a
popul and highli cultiv plain immedi beneath is visibl
through the rug ravin or over the cloudi summit of some tall
vast and voiceless mountain
48 when such a prospect is not attain on of the chief us of the
mountain cottag paradox as the idea mai appear is to increas
thi sens of solitud now as it will onli do so when it is seen at a
consider distanc it is necessari that it should be visibl or at
least that it presenc should be indic over a consider
portion of surround space it must not therefor be too much shade
by tree or it will be useless but if on the contrari it be too
conspicu on the open hillsid it will be liabl to most of the
object which were advanc against the swiss cottag and to
anoth which wa not then notic anyth which to the ey is
split into part appear less as a whole than what is undivid now a
consider mass of whatev tone or color it mai consist is as
easili divis by dot as by line that is a conspicu point on
ani part of it surfac will divid it into two portion each of which
will be individu measur by the ey but which will never make the
impress which thei would have made had their uniti not been
interrupt a conspicu cottag on a distant mountain side ha thi
effect in a fatal degre and is therefor alwai intoler
49 it should accordingli in order to reconcil the attain of the
good with the avoid of the evil be bare visibl it should not
tell as a cottag on the ey though it should on the mind for be it
observ that if it is onli by the closest investig that we can
ascertain it to be a human habit it will answer the purpos of
increas the solitud quit as well as if it were evid so
becaus thi impress is produc by it appeal to the thought not
by it effect on the ey it color therefor should be as nearli as
possibl that of the hill on which or the crag beneath which it is
place it form on that will incorpor well with the ground and
approach that of a larg stone more than of anyth els the color
will consequ if thi rule be follow be subdu and grayish
but rather warm and the form simpl grace and unpretend the
build should retain the same gener charact on a closer
examin everyth about it should be natur and should appear as
if the influenc and forc which were in oper around it had been
too strong to be resist and had render all effort of art to check
their power or conceal the evid of their action entir
unavail it cannot but be an alien child of the mountain but it
must show that it ha been adopt and cherish by them thi effect is
onli attain by great eas of outlin and varieti of color
peculiar which as will be present seen the westmoreland cottag
possess in a superemin degre
50 anoth feel with which on is impress dure a mountain
rambl is humil i found fault with the insignific of the swiss
cottag becaus it wa not content to sink into a quiet corner and
personifi humil now had it not been seen to be pretend it
would not have been felt to be insignific for the feel would
have been gratifi with it submiss to and retir from the
majesti of the destruct influenc which it rather seem to rise up
against in mockeri such pretens is especi to be avoid in the
mountain cottag it can never lie too humbl in the pastur of the
vallei nor shrink too submiss into the hollow of the hill it
should seem to be ask the storm for merci and the mountain for

strength that it is neither overwhelm by the on nor crush by the

53 such ar the prevail peculiar of the westmoreland cottag
is thi all some on will exclaim a hovel built of what first
come to hand and in the most simpl and conveni form not on
thought of architectur beauti ever come into the builder head
even so to thi illustr of an excel rule i wish
particularli to direct attent that the materi which natur
furnish in ani given countri and the form which she suggest will
alwai render the build the most beauti becaus the most
appropri observ how perfectli thi cottag fulfil the condit

is that of the ground on which it stand alwai subdu and grai but
exquisit rich the color be dispos crumblingli in group of

with each other as on a nativ rock and with the same beauti effect
the mass consequ at a distanc tell onli as a larg stone
would the simplic of it form contribut still farther to render
it inconspicu when place on a mountainsid such a cottag will
becom a point of interest which will reliev it monotoni but will
never cut the hill in two or take awai from it size in the vallei
the color of these cottag agre with everyth the green light
which trembl through the leafag of the taller tree fall with
exquisit effect on the rich grai of the ancient roof the deep pool of
clear water is not startl from it peac by their reflect the ivi

vallei doe now and then pretend in opposit to the gener custom
cling gracefulli and easili to it innumer crevic and rock lake
and meadow seem to hail it with a brotherli affect as if natur had
taken as much pain with it as she ha with them
54 again observ it eas of outlin there is not a singl straight
line to be met with from foundat to roof all is bend or broken
the form of everi stone in it wall is a studi for ow to the
infinit delicaci of structur in all miner a piec of stone 3 in
in diamet irregularli fractur and a littl worn by the weather
ha precis the same charact of outlin which we should find and
admir in a mountain of the same materi 6000 ft high9 and
therefor the ey though not feel the caus rest on everi cranni
and crack and fissur with delight it is true that we have no idea
that everi small project if of chert ha such an outlin as
scawfel if of graywack as skiddaw or if of slate as
helvellyn but their combin of form ar nevertheless felt to
be exquisit and we dwell upon everi bend of the rough roof and everi
hollow of the loos wall feel it to be a design which no architect
on earth could ever equal sculptur by a chisel of unimagin
delicaci and finish to a degre of perfect which is unnot
onli becaus it is everywher

55 thi eas and irregular is peculiarli delight where
grace and freedom of outlin and detail ar as thei alwai ar
in mountain countri the chief characterist of everi scene it is
well that where everi plant is wild and everi torrent free everi field
irregular in it form everi knoll variou in it outlin on is not
startl by well built wall or unyield roof but is permit to
trace in the stone of the peasant dwell as in the crag of the
mountain side no evid of the line or the mallet but the oper
of etern influenc the presenc of an almighti hand anoth
perfect connect with it eas of outlin is it sever of
charact there is no fopperi about it not the slightest effort at ani
kind of ornament but what natur choos to bestow it wear all it
decor wildli cover it naked not with what the peasant
mai plant but with what the wind mai bring there is no gai color or
neat about it no green shutter or other abomin all is calm
and quiet and sever as the mind of a philosoph and withal a
littl somber it is evid old and ha stood mani trial in it
dai and the snow and the tempest and the torrent have all spare it
and left it in it peac with it grai head unbow and it earli
strength unbroken even though the spirit of decai seem creep like

vener and slightli melancholi charact is the veri soul of all it

56 there remain onli on point to be notic it humil thi wa

delight and surpris to find that what court attent so littl is

57 such is the mountain cottag of westmoreland and such with
occasion varieti ar mani of the mountain cottag of england and
wale it is true that my memori rest with peculiar pleasur in a
certain quiet vallei near kirkston littl known to the gener
tourist distant from ani public track and therefor free from all
the horror of improvement10 in which it seem to me that the
architectur of the cottag had attain a peculiar degre of
perfect but i think that thi impress wa rather produc by a
few seemingli insignific accompani circumst than by ani
distinguish beauti of design in the cottag themselv their
inhabit were evid poor and appar had not repair their
dwell sinc their first erect and certainli had never torn on
tuft of moss or fern from roof or wall which were green with the rich
veget of year the vallei wa narrow and quiet and deep and
shade by reverend tree among whose trunk the grai cottag look
out with a perfect of effect which i never rememb to have seen
equal though i believ that in mani of the mountain district of
britain the peasant domicil is erect with equal good tast

sceneri though perhap want in sublim is distinguish by a
delic finish in it detail and by a unanim and proprieti of
feel in the work of it inhabit which ar elsewher look for
in vain and the reason of thi is evid the mind of the inhabit
of the contin in gener is capabl of deeper and finer sensat
than that of the island it is higher in it aspir purer in it
passion wilder in it dream and fiercer in it anger but it is
want in gentl and in it simplic natur desir of
excit and incap of experienc in equal degre the calmer
flow of human felic the still of domest peac and the
pleasur of the humbl hearth consist in everydai duti perform
and everydai merci receiv consequ in the higher walk of
architectur where the mind is to be impress or elev we never
have equal and we never shall equal them it will be seen
hereaft when we leav the lowli vallei for the torn ravin and the
grassi knoll for the rib precipic that if the continent
architect cannot adorn the pastur with the humbl roof thei can crest
the crag with etern battlements11 if thei cannot minist to a
landscap peac thei can add to it terror and it ha been alreadi
seen that in the lowland cottag of franc and itali where high and
refin feel were to be induc where melancholi wa to be excit
or majesti bestow the architect wa success and hi labor wa
perfect but now noth is requir but humil and gentl and
thi which he doe not feel he cannot give it is contrari to the

59 we cannot then be surpris at the effort at ornament and other
fanci architectur beauti which injur the effect of the more
peac mountain sceneri abroad but still less should we be surpris
at the perfect proprieti which prevail in the same kind of sceneri at
home for the error which is there induc by on mental defici is

nearest materi adapt it to it situat thi is all that is

countri when the king palac wa entir unfurnish with anyth
have the slightest pretens to the digniti of chimnei top and the
savori vapor which were wont to rise from the hospit hearth at
which the queen or princess prepar the feast with the whitest of

flat roof the digniti of smoke howev is now better understood and
it is dismiss through gothic pinnacl and as at burleigh hous
through tuscan column with a most praiseworthi regard to it comfort
and conveni let us consid if it is worth the troubl
62 we advanc a posit in the last paper that silenc is never
perfect without motion that is unless someth which might possibl
produc sound is evid to the ey the absenc of sound is not
surpris to the ear and therefor not impress let it be
observ for instanc how much the still of a summer even is
enhanc by the percept of the glide and majest motion of some
calm river strong but still or of the high and purpl cloud or of
the voiceless leav among the open branch to produc thi
impress howev the motion must be uniform though not necessarili
slow on of the chief peculiar of the ocean thoroughfar of
venic is the remark silenc which rest upon them enhanc as it
is by the swift but beautifulli uniform motion of the gondola now
there is no motion more uniform silent or beauti than that of
smoke and therefor when we wish the peac or still of a scene to
be impress it is highli us to draw the attent to it
63 in the cottag therefor a build peculiarli adapt for scene
of peac the chimnei as conduct the ey to what is agreeabl mai
be consid as import and if well manag a beauti

the fine silveri bluewhich among tree or rise out of a distant
countri is so exquisit beautifuland assum a dingi yellowish

longer desir or at least no longer attain be interrupt
by the natur of the build itself and final the associ it

perhap but ar quit as like to dream of kitchen and spit and
shoulder of mutton none of these imagin ar in their place if
the charact of the build be elev thei ar bare toler in
the dwell hous and the street now when smoke is objection it
is certainli improp to direct attent to the chimnei and
therefor for two weighti reason decor chimnei of ani sort or
size whatsoev ar inexcus barbar first becaus where smoke
is beauti decor is unsuit to the build and secondli
becaus where smoke is ugli decor direct attent to it
ugli
64 it is unfortun a prevail idea with some of our architect
that what is a disagre object in itself mai be reliev or
conceal by lavish ornament and there never wa a greater mistak it
should be a gener principl that what is intrins ugli should be
utterli destitut of ornament that the ey mai not be drawn to it the
pretend skull of the three magi at cologn ar set in gold and have
a diamond in each ey and ar a thousand time more ghastli than if
their brown bone had been left in peac such an error as thi ought
never to be commit in architectur if ani part of the build ha
disagre associ connect with it let it alon do not
ornament it keep it subdu and simpli adapt to it us and the ey
will not go to it nor quarrel with it it would have been well if thi
principl had been kept in view in the renew of some of the public
build in oxford in all soul colleg for instanc the architect
ha carri hi chimnei half as high as all the rest of the build
and fret them with gothic the ey is instantli caught by the plate
candlesticklik column and run with some complac up the groin
and fretwork and alight final and fatal on a red chimneytop he
might as well have built a gothic aisl at an entranc to a coal wharf
we have no scrupl in sai that the man who could desecr the gothic
trefoil into an ornament for a chimnei ha not the slightest feel
and never will have ani of it beauti or it us he wa never born to
be an architect and never will be on
65 now if chimnei ar not to be decor sinc their exist is
necessari it becom an object of some import to know what is to
be done with them and we enter into the inquiri befor leav the
cottag as in it most proper place becaus in the cottag and onli
in the cottag it is desir to direct attent to smoke
specul howev on the beau idal of a chimnei can never be
unshackl becaus though we mai imagin what it ought to be we can
never tell until the hous is built what it must be we mai requir
it to be short and find that it will smoke unless it is long or we
mai desir it to be cover and find it will not go unless it is open
we can fix therefor on no on model but by look over the chimnei
of a few nation we mai deduc some gener principl from their
varieti which mai alwai be brought into plai by whatev
circumst our own imagin mai be confin
66 look first to the mind of the peopl we cannot expect to find
good exampl of the chimnei as we go to the south the italian or the
spaniard doe not know the us of a chimnei properli speak thei
have such thing and thei light a fire five dai in the year
chiefli of wood which doe not give smoke enough to teach the chimnei
it busi but thei have not the slightest idea of the mean or the
beauti of such thing as hob and hearth and christma blaze and we
should therefor expect priori that there would be no soul in
their chimnei that thei would have no practic substanti air about
them that thei would in short be as awkward and as much in the wai
as individu of the human race ar when thei dont know what to do
with themselv or what thei were creat for but in england sweet
carbonac england we flatter ourselv we do know someth about
fire and smoke too or our ey have strang deceiv us and from
the whole comfort charact and firesid disposit of the nation
we should conjectur that the architectur of the chimnei would be
understood both as a matter of tast and as a matter of comfort to the
ne plu ultra of perfect let us see how far our expect ar

with such varieti no fault can be found becaus it is necessari to give

observ here onc for all that charact mai be given either by form
or by decor and that where the latter is improp varieti of form
is allow becaus the humbl associ which render ornament
objection also render simplic of form unnecessary13 we need
not then find fault with fantast chimnei provid thei ar kept in

fig s is a chimnei veri common in the eastern canton the principl
of which we never understood the obliqu part move on a hing so as
to be capabl of cover the chimnei like a hat and the whole is
cover with wooden scale like those of a fish thi chimnei sometim
come in veri well among the confus rafter of the mountain cottag
though it is rather too remark to be in good tast
77 it seem then that out of the eighteen chimnei which we have
notic though sever possess charact and on or two eleg onli
two ar to be found fit for imit and of these on is exclus
a cottag chimnei thi is somewhat remark and mai serv as a
proof
first of what we at first assert that chimnei which in ani wai
attract notic and if these had not we should not have sketch them
were seldom to be imit that there ar few build which requir
them to be singular and none which can toler them if decor and
that the architect should alwai rememb that the size and height be
by necess fix the form which draw least attent is the best
78 secondli that thi inconspicu is to be obtain not by
adher to ani model of simplic but by take especi care that
the line of the chimnei ar no interrupt and it color no contrast
to those of the build to which it belong thu fig h to m
would be far more actual remark in their natur situat if
thei were more simpl in their form for thei would interrupt the
charact of the rich architectur by which thei ar surround fig
d rise as it doe abov an old gothic window would have attract
instant attent had it not been for the occurr of the same line
in it which prevail beneath it the form of n onli assimil it more
close with the roof on which it stand but we must not imit
chimnei of thi kind for their excel consist onli in their
agreement with other detail separ from which thei would be
objection we can onli follow the principl of the design which
appear from all that we have advanc to be thi we requir in a
good chimnei the charact of the build to which it belong
divest of all it elev and it prevail line depriv of all
their ornament
79 thi it is no doubt excess difficult to give and in
consequ there ar veri few citi or edific in which the chimnei
ar not objection we must not therefor omit to notic the
fulfil of our expect found on english charact the onli
two chimnei fit for imit in the whole eighteen ar english and
we would not infer anyth from thi tend to invalid the
posit formerli advanc that there wa no tast in england but we
would adduc it as a farther illustr of the rule that what is most
adapt to it purpos is most beauti for that we have no tast
even in chimnei is suffici prove by the roof effect even of
the most ancient unaffect and unplast of our street in which
the chimnei instead of assist in the composit of the group of
roof stand out in stare mass of scarlet and black with fox and
cock whisk about like so mani littl black devil in the smoke on
the top of them interrupt all repos annihil all digniti and
awak everi possibl concept which would be picturesqu and everi
imagin which would be raptur to the mind of mastersweep
80 on the other hand though thei have not on the contin the same
knowledg of the us and beauti of chimnei in the abstract thei
displai their usual good tast in group or conceal them and
whether we find them mingl with the fantast domicil of the
german with the rich imagin of the spaniard with the classic
remain and creation of the italian thei ar never intrus or
disagre and either assist the group and reliev the
horizont of the line of the roof or remain entir unnot and
insignific smoke their pipe in peac
81 it is utterli imposs to give rule for the attain of these
effect sinc thei ar the result of a feel of the proport and
relat of line which if not natur to a person cannot be
acquir but by long practic and close observ and it presuppos
a power rare bestow on an english architect of set regular
at defianc and sometim comfort out of the question we could give
some particular exampl of thi group but as thi paper ha
alreadi swell to an unusu length we shall defer them until we come
to the consider of street effect in gener of the chimnei in the
abstract we ar afraid we have onli said enough to illustr without
remov the difficulti of design it but we cannot but think that
the gener principl which have been deduc if carefulli follow
out would be found us if not for the attain of excel at
least for the prevent of barbar

the cottageconclud remark
nunquam aliud natura aliud sapientia dicit
juven xiv 321
82 it now onli remain for us to conclud the subject of the cottag
by a few gener remark on the just applic of modern build to
adorn or vivifi natur sceneri
there ar we think onli three case in which the cottag is consid
as an element of architectur or ani other kind of beauti sinc it is
ordinarili rais by the peasant where he like and how he like and
therefor as we have seen frequent in good tast
83 i when a nobleman or man of fortun amus himself with
superintend the erect of the domicil of hi domest ii when
ornament summerhous or mimicri of wigwam ar to be erect as
ornament adjunct to a prospect which the owner ha done all he can to
spoil that it mai be worthi of the honor of have him to look at it
iii when the landlord exercis a certain degre of influenc over the
cottag of hi tenant or the improv of the neighbor villag
so as to induc such a tone of feel in the new erect as he mai
think suitabl to the situat
84 in the first of these case there is littl to be said for the
habit of the domest is gener a depend featur of hi
master and therefor to be consid as a part of it porter
lodg ar also depend upon and to be regul by the style of the
architectur to which thei ar attach and thei ar gener well
manag in england properli unit with the gate and ad to the
effect of the entranc
in the second case as the act is in itself a barbar it would be
useless to consid what would be the best mode of perpetr it
in the third case we think it will be us to appli a few gener
principl deduc from posit formerli advanc
85 all build ar of cours to be consid in connect with
the countri in which thei ar to be rais now all landscap must
possess on out of four distinct charact
it must be either woodi the green countri cultiv the blue
countri wild the grai countri or hilli the brown countri
i the woodi or green countri by thi is to be understood the mixtur
of park pastur and varieg forest which is onli to be seen in
temper climat and in those part of a kingdom which have not often
chang proprietor but have remain in unproduct beauti or at
least furnish timber onli the garden of the wealthier popul
it is to be seen in no other countri perhap so well as in england in
other district we find extens mass of black forest but not the
mixtur of sunni glade and variou foliag and dewi sward which we
meet with in the richer park district of england thi kind of countri
is alwai surgi ocean and massi in it outlin it never afford
blue distanc unless seen from a height and even then the nearer
group ar larg and draw awai the attent from the background the
under soil is kept cool by the shade and it veget rich so that
the prevail color except for a few dai at the fall of the leaf is
a fresh green a good exampl of thi kind of countri is the view from
richmond hill
86 now first let us consid what sort of feel thi green countri
excit and in order to do so be it observ that anyth which is
appar endur and unchang give us an impress rather of
futur than of past durat of exist but anyth which be
perish and from it natur subject to chang ha yet exist to a
great ag give us an impress of antiqu though of cours none
of stabil a mountain for instanc not geolog speak for
then the furrow on it brow give it ag as visibl as wa ever wrinkl
on human forehead but consid it as it appear to ordinari ey
appear to be beyond the influenc of chang it doe not put us in mind
of it past exist by show us ani of the effect of time upon
itself we do not feel that it is old becaus it is not approach ani
kind of death it is a mass of unsenti undecai matter which if
we think about it we discov must have exist for some time but
which doe not tell thi fact to our feel or rather which tell
us of no time at which it came into exist and therefor give us
no standard by which to measur it ag which unless measur cannot
be distinctli felt but a veri old forest tree is a thing subject to the
same law of natur as ourselv it is an energet be liabl to an
approach death it ag is written on everi sprai and becaus we
see it is suscept of life and annihil like our own we imagin
it must be capabl of the same feel and possess the same faculti
and abov all other memori it is alwai tell us about the past
never point to the futur we appeal to it as to a thing which ha
seen and felt dure a life similar to our own though of ten time it
durat and therefor receiv from it a perpetu impress of
antiqu so again a ruin town give us an impress of antiqu
the stone of which it is built none for their ag is not written upon
them
87 thi be the case it is evid that the chief feel induc by
woodi countri is on of rever for it antiqu there is a quiet
melancholi about the decai of the patriarch trunk which is enhanc
by the green and elast vigor of the young sapl the nobl form of
the forest aisl and the subdu light which penetr their
entangl bough combin to add to the impress and the whole
charact of the scene is calcul to excit conserv feel
the man who could remain a radic in a wood countri is a disgrac to
hi speci
88 now thi feel of mix melancholi and vener is the on of
all other which the modern cottag must not be allow to violat it
mai be fantast or rich in detail for the on charact will make it
look oldfashion and the other will assimil with the intertwin
of leaf and bough around it but it must not be spruce or natti or
veri bright in color and the older it look the better
a littl grotesqu in form is the more allow becaus the
imagin is natur activ in the obscur and indefinit daylight
of wood sceneri conjur up innumer be of everi size and
shape to peopl it allei and smile through it thicket and is by no
mean displeas to find some of it invent halfreal in a
decor panel or grin extrem of a rafter
89 these charact be kept in view as object to be attain the
remain consider ar technic
for the form select ani wellgrown group of the tree which prevail
most near the propos site of the cottag it summit will be a round
mass take the three princip point of it curv name it apex and
the two point where it unit itself with neighbor mass strike a
circl through these three point and the angl contain in the
segment cut off by a line join the two lower point is to be the
angl of the cottag roof of cours we ar not think of interior
conveni the architect must establish hi mode of beauti first and
then approach it as nearli as he can thi angl will gener be veri
obtus and thi is on reason why the swiss cottag is alwai beauti
when it is set among walnut or chestnut tree it obtus roof is just
about the true angl with pine or larch the angl should not be
regul by the form of the tree but by the slope of the branch the
build itself should be low and long so that if possibl it mai not
be seen all at onc but mai be partial conceal by trunk or leafag
at variou distanc
90 for the color that of wood is alwai beauti if the wood of the
near tree be us so much the better but the timber should be
roughhewn and allow to get weatherstain cold color will not
suit with green and therefor slate roof ar disagre unless
as in the westmoreland cottag the grai roof is warm with lichen
veget when it will do well with anyth but thatch is better if
the build be not of wood the wall mai be built of anyth which
will give them a quiet and unobtrud warmth of tone white if in
shade is sometim allow but if visibl at ani point more than
200 yard off it will spoil the whole landscap in gener as we saw
befor the build will bear some fantast finish that is if it
be entangl in forest but if among massiv group of tree separ
by smooth sward it must be kept simpl
91 ii the cultiv or blue countri thi is the rich champaign
land in which larg tree ar more sparingli scatter and which is
chiefli devot to the purpos of agricultur in thi we ar
perpetu get blue distanc from the slightest elev which
ar render more decidedli so by their contrast with warm corn or
plow field in the foreground such is the greater part of england
the view from the hill of malvern is a good exampl in district of
thi kind all is chang on year crop ha no memori of it
predecessor all is activ prosper and us noth is
left to the imagin there is no obscur no poetri no nonsens
the color of the landscap ar bright and vari it is thickli
popul and glow with anim life here then the charact of
the cottag must be cheer it color mai be vivid white is
alwai beauti even red tile ar allow and red brick
endur neat will not spoil it the angl of it roof mai be
acut it window sparkl and it rose red and abund but it
must not be ornament nor fantast it must be evid built for the
us of common life and have a matteroffact businesslik air about
it it outhous and pigsti and dunghil should therefor be kept
in sight the latter mai be made veri pretti object by twist them
with the pitchfork and plait them into braid as the swiss do
92 iii the wild or grai countri wild is not exactli a correct
epithet we mean wide uninclos treeless undul of land whether
cultiv or not the greater part of northern franc though well
brought under the plow would come under the denomin of grai
countri occasion mass of monoton forest do not destroi thi
charact here size is desir and massi of form but we must
have no bright of color in the cottag otherwis it would draw the
ey to it at three mile off and the whole landscap would be cover
with conspicu dot white is agreeabl if sober down slate
allow on the roof as well as thatch for the rest we need onli
refer to the remark made on the proprieti of the french cottag
93 lastli hill or brown countri and here if we look to england
alon as peculiarli a cottag countri the remark formerli advanc
in the consider of the westmoreland cottag ar suffici but if
we go into mountain district of more vari charact we shall find a
differ exist between everi rang of hill which will demand a
correspond differ in the style of their cottag the principl
howev ar the same in all situat and it would be a hopeless task
to endeavor to give more than gener principl in hill countri
howev anoth question is introduc whose investig is
peculiarli necessari in case in which the ground ha inequ of
surfac that of posit and the difficulti here is not so much to
ascertain where the build ought to be as to put it there without
suggest ani inquiri as to the mode in which it got there to prevent
it just applic from appear artifici but we cannot enter into
thi inquiri befor lai down a number of principl of composit
which ar applic not onli to cottag but gener and which we
cannot deduc until we come to the consider of build in
group
94 such ar the great divis under which countri and rural build
mai be comprehend but there ar intermedi condit in which
modifi form of the cottag ar applic and it frequent happen
that countri which consid in the abstract would fall under on of
these class possess ow to it peculiar climat or associ
a veri differ charact itali for instanc is blue countri yet it
ha not the least resembl to english blue countri we have paid
particular attent to wood first becaus we had not in ani previou
paper consid what wa beauti in a forest cottag and secondli
becaus in such district there is gener much more influenc
exercis by proprietor over their tenantri than in popul and
cultiv district and our english park sceneri though exquisit
beauti is sometim we think a littl monoton from the want of
thi veri featur
95 and now farewel to the cottag and with it to the humil of
natur sceneri we ar sorri to leav it not that we have ani idea of
live in a cottag as a comfort thing not that we prefer mud to
marbl or deal to mahogani but that with it we leav much of what is
most beauti of earth the low and beeinhabit sceneri which is
full of quiet and prideless emot of such calm as we can imagin
prevail over our earth when it wa new in heaven we ar go into
higher walk of architectur where we shall find a less close
connect establish between the build and the soil on which it
stand or the air with which it is surround but a closer connect
with the charact of it inhabit we shall have less to do with
natur feel and more with human passion we ar come out of
still into turbul out of seclus into the multitud out of
the wilder into the world

the villa
the mountain villa lago di como
the lowland villaengland
the british villa principl of composit
i
the mountain villalago di como
96 in all art or scienc befor we can determin what is just or
beauti in a group we must ascertain what is desir in the part
which compos it separ consid and therefor it will be most
advantag in the present case to keep out of the villag and the
citi until we have search hill and dale for exampl of isol
build thi mode of consid the subject is also agreeabl to the
feel as the transit from the higher order of solitari edific
to group of associ edific is not so sudden or startl as that
from natur most humbl peac to man most turbul pride
we have contempl the rural dwell of the peasant let us next
consid the rural domicil of the gentleman and here as befor
we shall first determin what is theoret beauti and then
observ how far our expect ar fulfil in individu build
but a few preliminari observ ar necessari
97 man the peasant is a be of more mark nation charact than
man the educ and refin for nation is found in a great
degre on prejudic and feel inculc and arous in youth
which grow inveter in the mind as long as it view ar confin to
the place of it birth it idea mold by the custom of it countri
and it convers limit to a circl compos of individu of
habit and feel like it own but which ar gradual soften down
and erad when the mind is led into gener view of thing when
it is guid by reflect instead of habit and ha begun to lai asid
opinion contract under the influenc of associ and
prepossess substitut in their room philosoph deduct from
the calm contempl of the variou temper and thought and
custom of mankind the love of it countri will remain with
undiminish strength in the cultiv mind but the nation mode of
think will vanish from the disciplin intellect
98 now as it is onli by these manner of thought that architectur
is affect we shall find that the more polish the mind of it
design the less nation will be the build for it architect will
be led awai by a search after a model of ideal beauti and will not be
involuntarili guid by deeproot feel govern irresist hi
heart and hand he will therefor be in perpetu danger of forget
the necessari unison of scene and climat and follow up the chase
of the ideal will neglect the beauti of the natur an error which he
could not commit were he less gener in hi view for then the
prejudic to which he would be subject would be as truli in unison
with the object which creat them as answer note with the chord
which awaken them we must not therefor be surpris if build
bear impress of the exercis of fine thought and high talent in their
design should yet offend us by perpetu discord with scene and
climat and if therefor we sometim deriv less instruct and
less pleasur from the columnar portico of the palac than from the
latch door of the cottag
99 again man in hi hour of relax when he is engag in the
pursuit of mere pleasur is less nation than when he is under the
influenc of ani of the more violent feel which agit everydai
life the reason of thi mai at first appear somewhat obscur but it
will becom evid on a littl reflect aristotl definit of
pleasur perhap the best ever given is an agit and settl of
the spirit into it own proper natur similar by the by to the
give of liberti of motion to the molecul of a miner follow by
their crystal into their own proper form now thi proper
natur greek hyparchousan physin is not the acquir nation
habit but the common and univers constitut of the human soul thi
constitut is kept under by the feel which prompt to action for
those feel depend upon part of charact or of prejudic which
ar peculiar to individu or to nation and the pleasur which all
men seek is a kind of partial cast awai of these more activ
feel to return to the calm and unchang constitut of mind
which is the same in all
100 we shall therefor find that man in the busi of hi life in
religion war or ambit is nation but in relax he manifest
a natur common to everi individu of hi race a turk for instanc
and an english farmer smoke their even pipe differ onli in so
much as the on ha a mouthpiec of amber and the other on of seal
wax the on ha a turban on hi head and the other a nightcap thei
ar the same in feel and to all intent and purpos the same men
but a turkish janissari and an english grenadi differ wide in all
their mode of think feel and act thei ar strictli
nation so again a tyroles even danc though the costum and
the step and the music mai be differ is the same in feel as that
of the parisian guinguett but follow the tyroles into their templ
and their deep devot and beauti though superstiti rever
will be found veri differ from ani feel exhibit dure a mass in
notredam thi be the case it is a direct consequ that we
shall find much nation in the church or the fortress or in ani
build devot to the purpos of activ life but veri littl in that
which is dedic exclus to relax the villa we shall be
compel to seek out nation of veri strong feel and imagin
disposit or we shall find no correspond whatev between their
charact and that of their build devot to pleasur
101 in our own countri for instanc there is not the slightest
begin at the head of windermer and run down it border for
about six mile there ar six import gentlemen seat villa thei
mai be call the first of which is a squar white mass decor with
pilast of no order set in a green avenu slope down to the water
the second is an imit we suppos of someth possess
theoret exist in switzerland with sharp gabl end and wooden
flourish turn the corner set on a littl dumpi mound with a slate
wall run all round it glitter with iron pyrit the third is a
blue darklook box squeez up into a group of straggli larch
with a bog in front of it the fourth is a creamcolor domicil in a
larg park rather quiet and unaffect the best of the four though
that is not sai much the fifth is an oldfashion thing formal
and narrowwindow yet grai in it tone and quiet and not to be
malign and the sixth is a nondescript circular puttycolor
habit with a leaden dome on the top of it
102 if howev instead of take windermer we trace the shore of
the lago di como we shall find some express and nation and
there therefor will we go to return howev to england when we
have obtain some data by which to judg of her more fortun
edific we notic the mountain villa first for two reason becaus
effect is alwai more consid in it erect than when it is to be
situat in a less interest countri and becaus the effect desir
is veri rare given there be far greater difficulti to contend
with but on word more befor set off for the south though as we
saw befor the gentleman ha less nation charact than the boor
hi individu charact is more mark especi in it finer
featur which ar clearli and perfectli develop by educ
consequ when the inhabit of the villa ha had anyth to do
with it erect we might expect to find indic of individu and
peculiar feel which it would be most interest to follow out but
thi is no part of our present task at some futur period we hope to
give a seri of essai on the habit of the most distinguish men
of europ show how the alter which thei direct and the
express which thei bestow correspond with the turn of their
emot and lead intellectu faculti but at present we have to
deal onli with gener we have to ascertain not what will be
pleas to a singl mind but what will afford gratif to everi
ey possess a certain degre of experi and everi mind endow
with a certain degre of tast
103 without further prefac therefor let us endeavor to ascertain
what would be theoret beauti on the shore or among the
sceneri of the larian lake preparatori to a sketch of the gener
featur of those villa which exist there in too great a multitud to
admit on our part of much individu detail
for the gener tone of the sceneri we mai refer to the paper on the
italian cottag for the shore of the lake of como have gener the
charact there describ with a littl more cheer and a littl
less elevation14 but aid by great varieti of form thei ar not
quit so rich in veget as the plain both becaus the soil is
scanti there be of cours no decomposit go on among the
rock of black marbl which form the greater part of the shore and
becaus the mountain rise steepli from the water leav onli a narrow
zone at their base in the climat of itali in that zone howev the
oliv grow in great luxuri with the cypress orang alo myrtl
and vine the latter alwai trellis
footnot 14 that italian mountain sceneri ha less elev of
charact than the plain mai appear singular but there ar mani simpl
reason for a fact which we doubt not ha been felt by everi on
capabl of feel anyth who ever left the alp to pass into
lombardi the first is that a mountain scene as we saw in the last
paper bear no trace of decai sinc it never possess ani of life
the desol of the steril peak never have been interrupt is
altogeth free from the melancholi which is consequ on the pass
awai of interrupt thei stood up in the time of itali glori into
the voiceless air while all the life and light which she rememb now
wa work and move at their feet an anim cloud which thei did
not feel and do not miss that region of life never reach up their
flank and ha left them no memori of it be thei have no
associ no monument no memori we look on them as we would on
other hill thing of abstract and natur magnific which the
presenc of man could not increas nor hi departur sadden thei ar
in consequ destitut of all that render the name of ausonia
thrill or her champaign beauti beyond the mere splendor of
climat and even that splendor is unshar by the mountain it cold
atmospher be undistinguish by ani of that rich purpl ether
transpar which give the air of the plain it depth of
feelingw can find no better express
secondli in all hill sceneri though there is increas of size there
is want of distanc we ar not speak of view from summit but of
the averag aspect of vallei suppos the mountain be 10000 feet
high their summit will not be more than six mile distant in a direct
line and there is a gener sens of confin induc by their
walllik boundari which is pain contrast with the wide
expati of spirit induc by a distant view over plain in ordinari
countri howev where the plain is an uninterest mass of
cultiv the sublim of distanc is not to be compar to that of
size but where everi yard of the cultiv countri ha it tale to
tell where it is perpetu intersect by river whose name ar
mean music and glanc with citi and villag everi on of which
ha it own halo round it head and where the ey is carri by the
clear of the air over the blue of the farthest horizon without
find on wreath of mist or on shadowi cloud to check the
distinct of the impress the mental emot excit ar richer
and deeper and swifter than could be awaken by the noblest hill of
the earth unconnect with the deed of men
lastli the plain countri of itali ha not even to choos between the
glori of distanc and of size for it ha both i do not think there is
a spot from venic to messina where two rang of mountain at the
least ar not in sight at the same time in lombardi the alp ar on
on side the apennin on the other in the venetian territori the
alp apennin and euganean hill go southward the apennin
alwai their outwork run far toward the sea and the coast itself
frequent mountain now the aspect of a nobl rang of hill at a
consider distanc is in our opinion far more impos consid
in the abstract than thei ar seen near their height is better told
their outlin softer and more melodi their majesti more mysteri
but in itali thei gain more by distanc than majesti thei gain life
thei ceas to be the cold forget thing thei were thei hold the
nobl plain in their lap and becom vener as have look down
upon them and watch over them forev unchang thei becom part
of the pictur of associ we endow them with memori and then feel
them to be possess of all that is gloriou on earth
for these three reason then the plain of itali possess far more
elev of charact than her hill sceneri to the northward thi
contrast is felt veri strikingli as the distinct is well mark the
alp rise sharpli and suddenli to the southward the plain is more
mingl with low project promontori and unit almost everi kind
of beauti howev even among her northern lake the rich of the
low climat and the magnific of form and color present by the
distant alp rais the charact of the scene immeasur abov that
of most hill landscap even were those natur featur entir
unassist by associ which though more sparingli scatter than
in the south ar suffici to give light to everi leaf and voic to
everi wave
104 now as to the situat of the cottag we have alreadi seen that
great humil wa necessari both in the build and it site to
prevent it from offend us by an appar struggl with forc
compar with which it strength wa dust but we cannot have thi
extrem humil in the villa the dwell of wealth and power and yet
we must not ani more suggest the idea of it resist natur
influenc under which the pyramid could not abid the onli wai of
solv the difficulti is to select such site as shall seem to have
been set asid by natur as place of rest as point of calm and
endur beauti ordain to sit and smile in their glori of quiet
while the avalanch brand the mountain top15 and the torrent
desol the vallei yet so preserv not by shelter amidst violenc
but by be place wholli out of the influenc of violenc for in thi
thei must differ from the site of the cottag that the peasant mai seek
for protect under some low rock or in some narrow dell but the villa
must have a domain to itself at onc conspicu beauti and calm
footnot 15 there ar two kind of winter avalanch the on sheet
of frozen snow slide on the surfac of other the swift of these
as the clavendi of the convent of st bernard told me he could
compar to noth but that of a cannon ball of equal size the other is
a roll mass of snow accumul in it descent thi graze the
bare hillsid tear up it surfac like dust bring awai soil
rock and veget as a graze ball tear flesh and leav it
wither path distinct on the green hillsid as if the mountain had
been brand with redhot iron thei gener keep to the same path
but when the snow accumul and send on down the wrong wai it ha
been known to cut down a pine forest as a scyth mow grass the tale
of it work is well told by the sear and brand mark on the hill
summit and side
105 as regard the form of the cottag we have seen how the
westmoreland cottag harmon with the eas of outlin so conspicu
in hill sceneri by the irregular of it detail but here no such
irregular is allow or consist and is not even desir for
the cottag enhanc the wild of the surround scene by
sympath with it the villa must do the same thing by contrast
with it the ey feel in a far greater degre the terror of the
distant and desol peak when it pass down their ravin side to
slope and verdant hill and is guid from these to the rich glow of
veget life in the low zone and through thi glow to the tall front
of some nobl edific peac even in it pride but thi contrast
must not be sudden or it will be startl and harsh and therefor as
we saw abov the villa must be place where all the sever featur of
the scene though not conceal ar distant and where there is a
graduat so to speak of impress from terror to loveli the
on soften by distanc the other elev in it style and the form
of the villa must not be fantast or angular but must be full of
varieti so temper by simplic as to obtain eas of outlin unit
with elev of charact the first be necessari for reason
befor advanc and the second that the whole mai harmon with the
feel induc by the lofti featur of the accompani sceneri in
ani hill countri and yet more on the larian lake by the deep memori
and everlast associ which haunt the still of it shore of
the color requir by italian landscap we have spoken befor and we
shall see that particularli in thi case white or pale tone ar
agreeabl
106 we shall now proce to the situat and form of the villa as
regard situat the villa of the lago di como ar built par
prfrenc either on jut promontori of low crag cover with
oliv or on those part of the shore where some mountain stream ha
carri out a bank of alluvium into the lake on object propos in
thi choic of situat is to catch the breez as it come up the main
open of the hill and to avoid the reflect of the sun rai from
the rock of the actual shore and anoth is to obtain a prospect up
or down the lake and of the hill on whose project the villa is
built but the effect of thi choic when the build is consid the
object is to carri it exactli into the place where it ought to be far
from the steep precipic and dark mountain to the border of the wind
bai and citronsc cape where it stand at onc conspicu and in
peac for instanc in the view of villa serbelloni16 from across the
lake although the ey fall suddenli from the crag abov to the
promontori below yet all the sublim and sever featur of the scene
ar kept in the distanc and the villa itself is mingl with grace
line and embosom in rich veget the promontori separ the
lake of lecco from that of como properli socal and is three mile
from the opposit shore which give room enough for arial perspect
footnot 16 villa serbelloni now the dpendenc of the htel grand
bretagn at bellaggio and villa sommariva now call villa carlotta
at cadenabbia and visit by everi tourist for it collect of modern
statuari ar both too well known to need illustr by the veri poor
woodcut which accompani thi chapter in the architectur
magazin the origin draw ar lost judg from that of the
cottag in val daosta we mai safe believ that thei were most
inadequ repres by the old cut
107 we shall now consid the form of the villa it is gener the
apex of a seri of artifici terrac which conduct through it
garden to the water these ar formal in their design but extens
wide and majest in their slope the step be gener about 12
ft high and 412 ft wide sometim howev much deeper thei ar
gener support by white wall strengthen by unfil arch the
angl be turn by sculptur pedest surmount by statu or
urn along the terrac ar carri row sometim of cypress more
frequent of orang or lemon tree with myrtl sweet bai and alo
intermingl but alwai with dark and spiri cypress occur in
group and attach to these terrac or to the villa itself ar
seri of arch grotto built or sometim cut in the rock for
cool frequent overhang the water kept dark and fresh and
altogeth delici to the feel a good instanc of these unit
peculiar is seen in villa sommariva lago di como
the effect of these approach is disput it is displeas to mani
from it formal but we ar persuad that it is right becaus it is
a nation style and therefor ha in all probabl due connect
with scene and charact and thi connect we shall endeavor to
prove
108 the frequent occurr of the arch is alwai delight in distant
effect partli on account of it grace line partli becaus the shade
it cast is vari in depth becom deeper and deeper as the grotto
retir and partli becaus it give great appar elev to the
wall which it support the grotto themselv ar agreeabl object
seen near becaus thei give an impress of cool to the ey and
thei echo all sound with great melodi small stream ar often
conduct through them occas slight breez by their motion then
the statu and the urn ar grace in their outlin classic in their
mean and correct in their posit for where could thei be more
appropri than here the on minist to memori and the other to
mourn the terrac themselv ar dignifi in their charact a
necessari effect as we saw abov and even the formal row of tree
ar right in thi climat for a peculiar reason effect is alwai to be
consid in itali as if the sun were alwai to shine for it doe
nine dai out of ten now the shadow of foliag regularli dispos
fall with a grace which it is imposs to describ run up and
down across the marbl step and cast altern statu into
dark and checker the white wall with a method in their
mad altogeth unattain by loos group of tree and
therefor for the sake of thi kind of shade to which the ey as well
as the feel is attract the long row of cypress or orang tree
is allow
109 but there is a still more import reason for it of a directli
contrari natur to that which it formal would seem to requir in
all beauti design of exterior descent a certain regular is
necessari the line should be grace but thei must balanc each
other slope answer to slope statu to statu now thi mathemat
regular would hurt the ey excess in the midst of scene of
natur grace were it execut in bare stone but if we make part of
the design itself foliag and put in touch of regular shade
altern with the stone whose distanc and dark ar as
mathemat limit as the rest of the group but whose natur is
chang and vari in individu form we have obtain a link
between natur and art a step of transit lead the feel
gradual from the beauti of regular to that of freedom and thi
effect would not be obtain as might at first appear by intermingl
tree of differ kind at irregular distanc or wherev thei chose
to grow for then the design and the foliag would be instantli
separ by the ey the symmetri of the on would be interrupt the
grace of the other lost the nobil of the design would not be seen
but it formal would be felt and the wild of the tree would be
injuri becaus it would be felt to be out of place on principl of
composit therefor the regular disposit of decor foliag is
right when such foliag is mix with architectur but it requir
great tast and long studi to design thi disposit properli tree
of dark leaf and littl color should be invari us for thei ar to
be consid it must be rememb rather as free touch of shade
than as tree
110 take for instanc the most simpl bit of design such as a hollow
balustrad and suppos that it is found to look cold or raw when
execut and to want depth then put small pot with ani dark shrub
the darker the better at fix place behind them at the same distanc
as the balustrad or between everi two or three and keep them cut
down to a certain height and we have immedi depth and increas
eas with undiminish symmetri but the great difficulti is to keep
the thing within proper limit sinc too much of it will lead to
paltri as is the case in a slight degre in isola bella on lago
maggior and not to let it run into small detail for be it
rememb that it is onli in the majesti of art in it larg and
gener effect that thi regular is allow noth but varieti
should be studi in detail and therefor there can be no barbar
greater than the lozeng border and bed of the french garden the
sceneri around must be natur rich that it varieti of line mai
reliev the slight stiff of the architectur itself and the climat
must alwai be consid for as we saw the chief beauti of these
flight of step depend upon the presenc of the sun and if thei ar
to be in shade half the year the dark tree will onli make them gloomi
the grass will grow between the stone of the step black weed will
flicker from the pedest damp moss discolor the statu and urn
and the whole will becom on incongru ruin on ridicul decai
besid the veri digniti of it charact even could it be kept in
proper order would be out of place in ani countri but itali bust of
virgil or ariosto would look astonish in an english snowstorm statu
of apollo and diana would be no more divin where the laurel of the
on would be weak and the crescent of the other would never gleam in
pure moonlight the whole glori of the design consist in it unison
with the digniti of the landscap and with the classic tone of the
countri take it awai from it concomit circumst and instead
of conduct the ey to it by a seri of lofti and dreami impress
bring it through green lane or over copsecov crag as would be
the case in england and the whole system becom utterli and absolut
absurd ugli in outlin wors than useless in applic unmean in
design and incongru in associ
111 it seem then that in the approach to the italian villa we have
discov great nation and great beauti which wa more than we
could have expect but a beauti utterli untransfer from it own
settl habit in our next paper we shall proce to the build
itself which will not detain us long as it is gener simpl in it
design and take a gener view of villa architectur over itali
112 we have bestow consider attent on thi style of garden
architectur becaus it ha been much abus by person of high
author and gener good tast who forgot in their love of grace
and ideal beauti the connect with surround circumst so
manifest even in it formal eustac we think is on of these and
although it is an error of a kind he is perpetu commit he is so
far right that thi manner is frequent carri into excess even in
it own peculiar domain then becom disagre and is alwai a
danger style in inexperienc hand we think howev paradox
as the opinion mai appear that everi on who is a true lover of natur
and ha been bred in her wild school will be an admir of thi
symmetr design in it place and will feel as often as he
contempl it that the unit effect of the wide and nobl step
with the pure water dash over them like heat crystal the long
shadow of the cypress grove the golden leav and gloriou light of
blossom of the glanc alo the pale statu gleam along the
height in their everlast death in life their motionless brow
look down forev on the loveli in which their be onc dwelt
marbl form of more than mortal grace lighten along the green
arcad amidst dark cool grotto full of the voic of dash water
and of the breath of myrtl blossom with the blue of the deep lake and
the distant precipic mingl at everi open with the etern snow
glow in their noontid silenc is on not unworthi of itali most
nobl remembr
ii
the mountain villalago di como continu
113 have consid the proprieti of the approach it remain for us
to investig the natur of the feel excit by the villa of the
lago di como in particular and of itali in gener
we mention that the base of the mountain border the lake of como
were chiefli compos of black marbl black at least when polish
and veri dark grai in it gener effect thi is veri fine stratifi
in bed vari in thick from an inch to two or three feet and
these bed taken of a medium thick form flat slab easili broken
into rectangular fragment which be excess compact in their
grain ar admir adapt for a build materi there is a littl
pale limestone17 among the hill to the south but thi marbl or
primit limeston for it is not highli crystallin is not onli more
easi of access but a more durabl stone of thi consequ almost
all the build on the lake shore ar built and therefor were
their materi unconc would be of a dark monoton and melancholi
grai tint equal uninterest to the ey and depress to the mind
to prevent thi result thei ar cover with differ composit
sometim white more frequent creamcolor and of vari depth
the mold and pilast be frequent of deeper tone than the
wall the insid of the grotto howev when not cut in the rock
itself ar left uncov thu form a strong contrast with the
white outsid give great depth and permit weed and flower
to root themselv on the rough and rock stream to distil
through the fissur of the dark stone while all part of the build
to which the ey is drawn by their form or detail except the capit
of the pilast such as the urn the statu the step or
balustrad ar execut in veri fine white marbl gener from the
quarri of carrara which suppli quantiti of fragment of the finest
qualiti which nevertheless ow to their want of size or to the
presenc of conspicu vein ar unavail for the higher purpos
of sculptur
footnot 17 pale limeston with dolomit a coars dolomit form the
mass of mountain on the east of lake lecco mont campion etc and
part of the other side as well as the mont del novo abov cadenabbia
but the base of the hill along the shore of the lake of lecco and
all the mountain on both side of the lower limb of como ar black
limeston the whole northern half of the lake is border by gneiss or
mica slate with tertiari deposit where torrent enter it so that the
dolomit is onli obtain by ascend the hill and incur
consider expens of carriag while the rock of the shore split
into block of their own accord and ar otherwis an excel
materi
114 now the first question is is thi veri pale color desir it
is to be hope so or els the whole of itali must be pronounc full of
improprieti the first circumst in it favor is on which though
connect onli with lake sceneri we shall notic at length as it is a
point of high import in our own countri when a small piec of quiet
water repos in a vallei or li embosom among crag it chief
beauti is deriv from our percept of crystallin depth unit with
excess slumber in it limit surfac we cannot get the sublim of
extent but we mai have the beauti of peac and the majesti of depth
the object must therefor be to get the ey off it surfac and to
draw it down to beguil it into that fairi land underneath which is
more beauti than what it repeat becaus it is all full of dream
unattain and illimit thi can onli be done by keep it edg
out of sight and guid the ey off the land into the reflect as
if it were pass into a mist until it find itself swim into the
blue sky with a thrill of unfathom fall if there be not a
touch of sky at the bottom the water will be disagre black and
the clearer the more fear now on touch of white reflect of
an object at the edg will destroi the whole illus for it will come
like the flash of light on armor and will show the surfac not the
depth it will tell the ey whereabout it is will defin the limit of
the edg and will turn the dream of limitless depth into a small
uninterest reposeless piec of water in all small lake or pool
therefor steep border of dark crag or of thick foliag ar to be
obtain if possibl even a shingli shore will spoil them and thi
wa on reason it will be rememb for our admir of the color of
the westmoreland cottag becaus it never broke the repos of water by
it reflect
115 but thi principl appli onli to small piec of water on which
we look down as much as along the surfac as soon as we get a sheet
even if onli a mile across we lose depth first becaus it is almost
imposs to get the surfac without a breez on some part of it and
again becaus we look along it and get a great deal of sky in the
reflect which when occupi too much space tell as mere flat
light but we mai have the beauti of extent in a veri high degre and
it is therefor desir to know how far the water goe that we mai
have a clear concept of it space now it border at a great
distanc is alwai lost unless it be defin by a veri distinct line
and such a line is harsh flat and cut on the ey to avoid thi
the border itself should be dark as in the other case so that there
mai be no continu horizont line of demarc but on or two
bright white object should be set here and there along or near the
edg their reflect will flash on the dark water and will inform
the ey in a moment of the whole distanc and transpar of the
surfac it is travers when there is a slight swell on the water
thei will come down in long beauti perpendicular line mingl
exquisit with the streaki green of reflect foliag when there is
none thei becom a distant imag of the object thei repeat endow
with infinit repos
116 these remark true of small lake whose edg ar green appli
with far greater forc to sheet of water on which the ey pass over
ten or twenti mile in on long glanc and the prevail color of
whose border is as we notic when speak of the italian cottag
blue the white reflect ar here excess valuabl give space
brillianc and transpar and furnish on veri power apolog
even did other object render an apolog necessari for the pale tone
of the color of the villa whose reflect ow to their size and
conspicu situat alwai take a consider part in the scene
and ar therefor thing to be attent consid in the erect of
such build particularli in a climat whose calm render it
lake quiet for the greater part of the dai noth in fact can be
more beauti than the intermingl of these bright line with the
dark of the revers cypress seen against the deep azur of the
distant hill in the crystallin water of the lake of which some on
aptli sai deep within it azur rest white villag sleep
silently18 or than their columnar perspect as villag after
villag catch the light and strike the imag to the veri quietest
recess of the narrow water and the veri farthest hollow of the fold
hill
footnot 18 a reminisc of two line from a poem on the lago di
como written by the author in 1833
117 from all thi it appear that the effect of the white villa in
water is delight on land it is quit as import but more
doubt the first object which strike us instantli when we
imagin such a build is the want of repos the startl glare of
effect induc by it unsubdu tint but thi object doe not
strike us when we see the build a circumst which wa partli
account for befor in speak of the cottag and which we shall
present see farther caus not to be surpris at a more import
object is that such white destroi a great deal of vener
charact and harmon ill with the melancholi tone of surround
landscap and thi requir detail consider
118 pale of color destroi the majesti of a build first by
hint at a disguis and humbl materi and secondli by take
awai all appear of ag we shall speak of the effect of the materi
present but the depriv of appar antiqu is depend in a
great degre on the color and in itali where as we saw befor
everyth ought to point to the past is seriou injuri though for
sever reason not so fatal as might be imagin for we do not
requir in a build rais as a light summerhous wherein to while
awai a few pleasur hour the evid of ancestr digniti without
which the chteau or palac can possess hardli ani beauti we know that
it is origin built more as a playth than as a monument as the
delight of an individu not the possess of a race and that the
veri light and careless of feel with which such a domicil is
enter and inhabit by it first builder would demand to sympath
and keep in unison with them not the kind of build adapt to excit
the vener of ag but that which can most gayli minist to the
amus of hour for all men desir to have memori of their
action but none of their recreat inasmuch as we onli wish that to
be rememb which other will not or cannot perform or experi
and we know that all men can enjoi recreat as much as ourselv we
wish succeed gener to admir our energi but not even to be
awar of our lassitud to know when we move but not when we rest
how we rule not how we condescend and therefor in the case of
the triumphal arch or the hereditari palac if we ar the builder we
desir stabil if the behold we ar offend with novelti but in
the case of the villa the builder desir onli a correspond with
hi humor the behold evid of such correspond for he feel
that the villa is most beauti when it minist most to pleasur
that it cannot minist to pleasur without perpetu chang so as to
suit the vari idea and humor and imagin of it inhabit
and that it cannot possess thi light and variabl habit with ani
appear of antiqu
119 and for a yet more import reason such appear is not
desir melancholi when it is product of pleasur is accompani
either by loveli in the object excit it or by a feel of pride
in the mind experienc it without on of these it becom absolut
pain which all men throw off as soon as thei can and suffer under as
long as their mind ar too weak for the effort now when it is
accompani by loveli in the object excit it it form beauti
when by a feel of pride it constitut the pleasur we experi in
tragedi when we have the pride of endur or in contempl the
ruin or the monument by which we ar inform or remind of the pride
of the past henc it appear that ag is beauti onli when it is the
decai of glori or of power and memori onli delight when it repos
upon pride19 all remain therefor of what wa mere devot to
pleasur all evid of lost enjoy all memori of the
recreat and rest of the depart in a word all desol of
delight is product of mere pain for there is no feel of
exult connect with it thu in ani ancient habit we pass
with rever and pleasur emot through the order armori where
the lanc lie with none to wield through the lofti hall where the
crest scutcheon glow with the honor of the dead but we turn sickli
awai from the arbor which ha no hand to tend it and the boudoir which
ha no life to lighten it and the smooth sward which ha no light feet
to danc on it so it is in the villa the more memori the more sorrow
and therefor the less adapt to it present purpos but though
cheer it should be ether in it express spiritu is a good
word give idea of the veri highest order of delight that can be
obtain in the mere present
footnot 19 observ we ar not speak of emot felt on
rememb what we ourselv have enjoi for then the imagin is
product of pleasur by replac us in enjoy but of the feel
excit in the indiffer spectat by the evid decai of power or
desol of enjoy of which the first ennobl the other onli
harrow the spirit
120 it seem then that for all these reason an appear of ag is
not desir far less necessari in the villa but it exist
charact must be in unison with it countri and it must appear to be
inhabit by on brought up in that countri and imbu with it
nation feel in itali especi though we can even here
dispens with on compon part of elev of characterag we
must have all the other we must have high feel beauti of form and
depth of effect or the thing will be a barbar the inhabit must
be an italian full of imagin and emot a villa inhabit by an
englishman no matter how close it imit of other will alwai be
preposter
we find therefor that white is not to be blame in the villa for
destroi it antiqu neither is it reprehens as harmon
ill with the surround landscap on the contrari it add to it
brillianc without take awai from it depth of tone we shall
consid it as an element of landscap more particularli when we come
to speak of group
121 there remain onli on accus to be answer viz that it
hint at a paltri and unsubstanti materi and thi lead us to the
second question is thi materi allow if it were distinctli felt
by the ey to be stucco there could be no question about the matter it
would be decidedli disagre but all the part to which the ey is
attract ar execut in marbl and the stucco mere form the dead
flat of the build not a singl wreath of ornament be form of
it it surfac is smooth and bright and altogeth avoid what a stone
build when not built of larg mass and uncharg with ornament
alwai forc upon the attent the rectangular line of the block
which howev nice fit thei mai be ar horribl most horribl
there is also a great deal of eas and soft in the angular line of
the stucco which ar never sharp or harsh like those of stone and it
receiv shadow with great beauti a point of infinit import in
thi climat give them light and transpar without ani
diminut of depth it is also agreeabl to the ey to pass from the
sharp carv of the marbl decor to the eas and smooth of
the stucco while the utter want of interest in those part which ar
execut in it prevent the humil of the materi from be
offens for thi passag of the ey from the marbl to the
composit is manag with the dexter of the artist who that the
attent mai be drawn to the singl point of the pictur which is hi
subject leav the rest so obscur and slightli paint that the mind
lose it altogeth in it attent to the princip featur
122 with all howev that can be alleg in extenu of it
fault it cannot be deni that the stucco doe take awai so much of
the digniti of the build that unless we find enough bestow by it
form and detail to counterbal and a great deal more than
counterbal the deterior occas by tone and materi the
whole edific must be condemn as incongru with the spirit of the
climat and even with the charact of it own garden and approach it
remain therefor to notic the detail themselv it form is simpl
to a degre the roof gener quit flat so as to leav the mass in
the form of a parallelopip in gener without wing or adjunct of
ani sort villa sommariva carlotta is a good exampl of thi gener
form and proport though it ha an arch passag on each side which
take awai from it massi thi excess weight of effect would be
injuri if the build were set by itself but as it alwai form
the apex of a seri of complic terrac it both reliev them and
gain great digniti by it own unbroken simplic of size thi gener
effect of form is not injur when as is often the case an open
passag is left in the center of the build under tall and
wellproport arch support by pilast never by column
villa porro lago di como is a good exampl of thi method the arch
hardli ever exce three in number and these ar all of the same size
so that the crown of the arch continu the horizont line of the
rest of the build were the center on higher than the other these
line would be interrupt and a great deal of simplic lost the
cover space under these arch is a delight shade and breezi
retreat in the heat of the dai and the entranc door usual open into
it so that a current of cool air is obtain by throw them open
123 the build itself consist of three floor we rememb no
instanc of a greater number and onli on or two of fewer it is in
gener crown with a light balustrad surmount by statu at
interv the window of the uppermost floor ar usual squar often
without ani architrav those of the princip floor ar surround with
broad architrav but ar frequent destitut of friez or cornic
thei have usual flat band at the bottom and their apertur is a
doubl squar their recess is veri deep so as not to let the sun fall
far into the interior the interv between them is veri variabl in
some of the villa of highest pretens such as those on the bank of
the brenta that of isola bella and other which do not face the
south it is not much more than the breadth of the two architrav so
that the room within ar fill with light when thi is the case the
window have friez and cornic but when the build front the
south the interv is often veri great as in the case of the villa
porro the groundfloor window ar frequent set in tall arch
support on deepli engag pilast as in the villa sommariva the
door is not larg and never enter by high step as it gener
open on a terrac of consider height or on a wide landingplac at
the head of a flight of fifti or sixti step descend through the
garden
124 now it will be observ that in these gener form though
there is no splendor there is great digniti the line throughout ar
simpl to a degre entir uninterrupt by decor of ani kind
so that the beauti of their proport is left visibl and evid we
shall see hereaft that ornament in grecian architectur while when
well manag it alwai add to it grace invari take awai from
it majesti and that these two attribut never can exist togeth in
their highest degre by the utter absenc of decor therefor
the italian villa possess as it usual doe great beauti of
proport attain a degre of elev of charact which impress
the mind in a manner which it find difficult to account for by ani
consider of it simpl detail or moder size while at the same
time it lai so littl claim to the attent and is so subdu in it
charact that it is enabl to occupi a conspicu place in a
landscap without ani appear of intrus the glanc of the
behold rise from the labyrinth of terrac and arbor beneath almost
weariedli it meet as it ascend with a gradual increas of bright
marbl and simpl light and with a proportion diminut of dark
foliag and complic shadow till it rest final on a piec of
simpl brillianc chast and unpretend yet singularli dignifi
and doe not find it color too harsh becaus it form is so simpl
for color of ani kind is onli injuri when the ey is too much
attract to it and when there is so much quiet of detail as to
prevent thi misfortun the build will possess the cheer
without lose the tranquil and will seem to have been erect and
to be inhabit by a mind of that beauti tempera wherein modesti
temper majesti and gentl mingl with rejoic which abov all
other is most suit to the essenc and most interwoven with the
spirit of the natur beauti whose peculiar power is invari repos
125 so much for it gener charact consid by principl of
composit it will also be found beauti it prevail line ar
horizont and everi artist know that where peak of ani kind ar in
sight the line abov which thei rise ought to be flat it ha not on
acut angl in all it detail and veri few intersect of vertic
with horizont while all that do intersect seem us as support
the mass the just applic of the statu at the top is more
doubt and is consid reprehens by sever high author
who nevertheless ar inconsist enough to let the balustrad pass
uncalumni though it is objection on exactli the same ground
for if the statu suggest the inquiri of what ar thei do there
the balustrad compel it behold to ask whom it keep from tumbl
over
126 the truth is that the balustrad and statu deriv their origin
from a period when there wa easi access to the roof of either templ or
villa that there wa such access is prove by a passag in the
iphigenia taurica line 113 where orest speak of get up to the
triglyph of a doric templ as an easi matter and when the flat roof
were us not perhap as an even promenad as in palestin but
as a place of observ and occasion of defens thei were
compos of larg flat slab of stone greek keramos20 peculiarli
adapt for walk on or two of which when taken up left an open
of easi access into the hous as in luke v 19 and were perpetu
us in greec as missil weapon in the event of a hostil attack or
sedit in the citi by parti of old men women and children who
us as a matter of cours to retir to the roof as a place of
conveni defens by such attack from the roof with the greek
keramo the theban were thrown into confus in plata thucydid
ii 4 so also we find the roof immedi resort to in the case
of the starv of pausania in the templ of minerva of the brazen
hous and in that of the massacr of the aristocrat parti at corcyra
thucydid iv 48greek anabant de epi to tego tou oikmato
kai dielont tn orophn eballon t keram
footnot 20 in the larg build that is greek keramo also
signifi earthen tile and sometim earthenwar in gener as in
herodotu iii 6 where it is us of earthen jar of wine it
appear that such tile wa frequent us in smaller edific the
greek mai have deriv their flat roof from egypt herodotu mention
of the labyrinth of the twelv king that greek horoph de pantn
toutn lithin but not as if the circumst were in the least
extraordinari herodotu ii 148
127 now where the roof wa thu a place of frequent resort there
could be no more us decor than a balustrad nor on more
appropri or beauti than occasion statu in attitud of
watch expect or observ and even now wherev the
roof is flat we have an idea of conveni and facil of access
which still render the balustrad agreeabl and the statu beauti
if well design it must not be a figur of perfect peac or repos
far less should it be in violent action but it should be fix in that
quick startl still which is the result of intent observ or
expect and which seem readi to start into motion everi instant
it height should be slightli coloss as it is alwai to be seen
against the sky and it draperi should not be too heavi as the ey
will alwai expect them to be caught by the wind we shall enter into
thi subject howev more fulli hereaft we onli wish at present to
vindic from the charg of improprieti on of the chief featur of
the italian villa it white figur alwai marbl remain entir
unsulli by the weather and stand out with great majesti against the
blue air behind them take awai from the heavi without destroi
the simplic of the gener form
128 it seem then that by it form and detail the villa of the lago
di como attain so high a degre of elev of charact as not onli
bring it into harmoni of it locu without ani assist from
appear of antiqu but mai we think permit it to dispens even
with solid of materi and appear in light summer stucco instead of
rais itself in imperish marbl and thi conclus which is

where it is allow to get worn and discolor and broken it induc
a wretch mockeri of the dignifi form which it preserv but as
long as it is renew at proper period and watch over by the ey of

129 with all the prais howev which we have bestow upon it we do
not sai that the villa of the larian lake is perfect inde we
cannot sai so until we have compar it with a few other instanc
chiefli to be found in itali on whose soil we delai as be the
nativ countri of the villa properli socal and as ever yet be
almost the onli spot of europ where ani good specimen of it ar to be
found for we do not understand by the term villa a cubic erect
with on window on each side of a verdant door and three on the second
and uppermost stori such as the word suggest to the fertil
imagin of rural cheesemong neither do we understand the
quiet and unpretend countri hous of a respect gentleman neither
do we understand such a magnific mass of hereditari stone as
gener form the autumn retreat of an english nobl but we
understand the light but elabor summer habit rais howev and
wherev it pleas hi fanci by some individu of great wealth and
influenc who can enrich it with everi attribut of beauti furnish it
with everi appurten of pleasur and repos in it with the digniti
of a mind train to exert or author such a build could not
exist in greec where everi district a mile and a quarter squar wa
quarrel with all it neighbor it could exist and did exist in
itali where the roman power secur tranquil and the roman
constitut distribut it author among a great number of
individu on whom while it rais them to a posit of great
influenc and in it later time of wealth it did not bestow the
power of rais palac or privat fortress the villa wa their
peculiar habit their onli resourc and a most agreeabl on
becaus the multitud of the kingdom be for a long period confin
to a narrow territori though rule the world render the popul
of the citi so dens as to drive out it higher rank to the
neighbor hamlet of tibur and tusculum
130 in other district of europ the villa is not found becaus in
veri perfect monarchi as in austria the power is thrown chiefli into
the hand of a few who build themselv palac not villa and in
perfect republ as in switzerland the power is so split among the
multitud that nobodi can build himself anyth in gener in
kingdom of great extent the countri hous becom the perman and
hereditari habit and the villa ar all crowd togeth and form
gingerbread row in the environ of the capit and in franc and
germani the excess disturb state of affair in the middl ag
compel everi baron or nobl to defend himself and retali on hi
neighbor as he best could till the villa wa lost in the chteau and
the fortress and men now continu to build as their forefath built
and long mai thei do so surround the domicil of pleasur with a
moat and a glaci and guard it garret window with turret and
tower while in england the nobl compar few and of great
power inhabit palac not villa and the rest of the popul is
chiefli crowd into citi in the activ of commerc or dispers
over estat in that of agricultur leav onli on grade of gentri
who have neither the tast to desir nor the power to erect the villa
properli socal
131 we must not therefor be surpris if on leav itali where
the crowd of povertystricken nobil can still repos their pride in
the true villa we find no farther exampl of it worthi of
consider though we hope to have far greater pleasur in
contempl it substitut the chteau and the fortress we must be
excus therefor for devot on paper more to the state of villa
architectur in itali after which we shall endeavor to appli the
principl we shall have deduc to the correct of some abus in the
erect of english countri hous in case where sceneri would demand
beauti of design and wealth permit finish of decor

the italian villa conclud
132 we do not think there is ani truth in the aphor now so
frequent advanc in england that the adapt of shelter to the
corpor comfort of the human race is the origin and true end of the
art of architectur properli socal for were such the case he
would be the most distinguish architect who wa best acquaint with
the properti of cement with the natur of stone and the variou
durabl of wood that such knowledg is necessari to the perfect
architect we do not deni but it is no more the end and purpos of hi
applic than a knowledg of the alphabet is the object of the
refin scholar or of rhythm of the inspir poet
133 for suppos that we were for a moment to consid that we built
a hous mere to be live in and that the whole bent of our
invent in rais the edific is to be direct to the provis of
comfort for the life to be spent therein suppos that we build it
with the most perfect dryness and cool of cellar the most luxuri
appurten of pantri that we build our wall with the most compact
strength of materi the most studi economi of space that we leav
not a chink in the floor for a breath of wind to pass through not a
hing in the door which by ani possibl exert of it irrit
muscl could creak that we elev our chamber into exquisit
cool furnish them with everi attent to the mainten of
gener health as well as the prevent of present inconveni to
do all thi we must be possess of great knowledg and variou skill
let thi knowledg and skill be appli with the greatest energi and
what have thei done exactli as much as brute anim can do by mere
instinct noth more than bee and beaver mole and magpi ant
and earwig do everi dai of their live without the slightest effort
of reason we have made ourselv superior as architect to the most
degrad anim of the univers onli insomuch as we have lavish
the highest effort of intellect to do what thei have done with the
most limit sensat that can constitut life
134 the mere prepar of conveni therefor is not architectur
in which man can take pride or ought to take delight21 but the high
and ennobl art of architectur is that of give to build whose
part ar determin by necess such form and color as shall
delight the mind by prepar it for the oper to which it is to
be subject in the build and thu as it is altogeth to the mind
that the work of the architect is address it is not as a part of hi
art but as a limit of it extent that he must be acquaint with
the minor principl of the economi of domest erect for thi
reason though we shall notic everi class of edific it doe not come
within our propos plan to enter into ani detail consider of
the inferior build of each class which afford no scope for the plai
of the imagin by their natur or size but we shall gener
select the most perfect and beauti exampl as those in which alon
the architect ha the power of fulfil the high purpos of hi art
in the villa howev some except must be made inasmuch as it will
be us and perhap interest to arriv at some fix conclus
respect the modern build improperli call villa rais by
moder wealth and of limit size in which the architect is
compel to produc hi effect without extent or decor the
principl which we have hitherto arriv at deduc as thei ar from
edific of the noblest charact will be but of littl us to a
countri gentleman about to insinu himself and hi habit into a
quiet corner of our love countri and therefor we must glanc at
the more humbl home of the italian preparatori to the consider
of what will best suit our own less elev sceneri

135 first then we lose the terrac approach or at least it size
and splendor as these requir great wealth to erect them and perpetu
expens to preserv them for the chain of terrac we find substitut
a simpl garden somewhat formal laid out but redeem from the
charg of mean by the nobil and size attain by most of it
tree the line of immens cypress which gener surround it in

partli rejoic over as preserv at all the grotto of the superior
garden ar here replac by light rang of arch summerhous
design in stucco and occasion adorn in their interior with
fresco paint of consider bright and beauti
136 all thi howev ha veri littl effect in introduc the ey to
the villa itself ow to the gener want of inequ of level in
the ground so that the main build becom an independ featur
instead of form the apex of a mass of variou architectur
consequ the weight of form which in the former case it might and
even ought to possess would here be cumbrou ugli and improp and
accordingli we find it got rid of thi is done first by the addit
of the squar tower a featur which is not allow to break in upon the
symmetri of build of high architectur pretens but is
immedi introduc whenev less rich of detail or varieti of
approach demand or admit of irregular of form it is a constant
and most import featur in italian landscap sometim high and
appar detach as when it belong to sacr edific sometim
low and strong unit with the mass of the fortress or vari the
form of the villa it is alwai simpl in it design flatroof it

carri up the whole height of the tower whatev it mai be without
ani regard to proport termin in two arch on each side in the

side near the top ar veri often the onli entranc by which light or
sun can penetr these ar seldom actual larg alwai

137 the form of the villa to which these tower ar attach ar

of simplic is alwai kept in view everyth is squar and
termin by parallel line no tall chimnei no conic roof no
fantast ornament ar ever admit the arch alon is allow to

frequent but not in the window which ar either squar or doubl

thei ar set moder close and protect by an outer line of arch
deep enough to keep the noondai sun from enter the room these line
of arch cast soft shadow along the bright front and ar otherwis
of great valu their effect is pretti well seen in fig 10 a piec
which while it ha no distinguish beauti is yet pleas by it
entir simplic and peculiarli so when we know that simplic to

138 the buttress is the onli remain point worthi of notic it
prevail to a consider extent among the villa of the south be
alwai broad and tall and occasion so frequent as to give the
build view later a pyramid and cumbrou effect the most
usual form is that of a simpl slope mass termin in the wall
without the slightest finish and rise at an angl of about 84
sometim it is perpendicular slope at the top into the wall but it
never ha step of increas project as it goe down by observ
the occurr of these buttress an architect who knew noth of
geologi might accur determin the point of most energet
volcan action in itali for their us is to protect the build from
the injuri of earthquak the italian have far too much good tast
to us them except in case of extrem necess thu thei ar never
found in north itali even in the fortress thei begin to occur among
the apennin south of florenc thei becom more and more frequent and
massi toward rome in the neighborhood of napl thei ar huge and

same state of thing continu as we go south on the coast of calabria

139 now these buttress present on of the most extraordinari and
strike instanc of the beauti of adapt of style to local and
peculiar of circumst that can be met with in the whole rang of
architectur investig taken in the abstract thei ar utterli
detest formal clumsi and appar unnecessari their builder
think so himself he hate them as thing to be look at though he
erect them as thing to be depend upon he ha no idea that there is
ani proprieti in their presenc though he know perfectli well that
there is a great deal of necess and therefor he build them

140 throughout the whole of thi broken countri and on the summit of
these volcan cone rise innumer villa but thei do not offend
us as we should have expect by their attest of cheer of

thei seem to rise prepar and adapt for resist to and endur

proport the form of the wall of men to the cleft in the flank of

transitori life from startl like a mockeri the etern remain of

141 we have alwai consid these circumst as most remark
proof of the perfect depend of architectur on it situat and
of the utter imposs of judg of the beauti of ani build in
the abstract and we would also lai much stress upon them as show
with what bold the design mai introduc into hi build
undisguis such part as local circumst render desir for
there will invari be someth in the natur of that which caus
their necess which will endow them with beauti
142 these then ar the princip featur of the italian villa
modif of which of cours more or less dignifi in size

their proprietor mai be consid as compos everi build of that
class in itali a few remark on their gener effect will enabl us to
conclud the subject
143 we have been so long accustom to see the horizont line and
simpl form which as we have observ still prevail among the
ausonian villa us with the greatest dexter and the noblest
effect in the composit of claud salvat and poussinand so
habitu to consid these composit as perfect model of the
beauti as well as the pure in tastethat it is difficult to divest
ourselv of prejudic in the contempl of the sourc from which
those master receiv their educ their feel and their
subject we would hope howev and we think it mai be prove that in
thi case principl assist and encourag prejudic first refer
onli to the gratif afford to the ey which we know to depend
upon fix mathemat principl though those principl ar not
alwai develop it is to be observ that countri is alwai most
beauti when it is made up of curv and that on of the chief
charact of ausonian landscap is the perfect of it curvatur
induc by the gradual undul of promontori into the plain in
suit architectur to such a countri that build which least
interrupt the curv on which it is place will be felt to be most
delight to the ey
illustr fig 11 broken curv
144 let us take then the simpl form a b c d interrupt the curv
c e fig 11 a now the ey will alwai continu the princip
line of such an object for itself until thei cut the main curv that
is it will carri on a b to e and the total effect of the
interrupt will be that of the form c d e had the line b d been
nearer to a c the effect would have been just the same now everi
curv mai be consid as compos of an infinit number of line at
right angl to each other as m n is made up of o p p q etc
fig b whose ratio to each other vari with the direct of the
curv then if the right line which form the curv at c fig a be
increas we have the figur c d e that is the appar
interrupt of the curv is an increas part of the curv itself to
the mathemat reader we can explain our mean more clearli by
point out that take c for our origin we have a c a e for
the coordin of e and that therefor their ratio is the
equat to the curv whenc it appear that when ani curv is broken
in upon by a build compos of simpl vertic and horizont line
the ey is furnish by the interrupt with the equat to that
part of the curv which is interrupt if instead of squar form we
take obliqu as r s t fig c we have on line s t an
absolut break and the other r s in fals proport if we take
anoth curv we have an infinit number of line onli two of which
ar where thei ought to be and thi is the true reason for the constant
introduct of featur which appear to be somewhat formal into the
most perfect imagin of the old master and the true caus of the
extrem beauti of the group form by italian villag in gener
145 thu much for the mere effect on the ey of correspond with
nation charact we have shown that we must not be disappoint if
we find littl in the villa the unfrequ of window in the bodi of
the build is partli attribut to the climat but the total
exclus of light from some part as the base of the central tower
carri our thought back to the ancient system of italian life when
everi man home had it dark secret place the abod of hi worst

147 although as we have frequent observ our chief object in these
paper is to discov the connect exist between nation
architectur and charact and therefor is on lead us rather to
the investig of what is than of what ought to be we yet consid
that the subject would be imperfectli treat if we did not at the
conclus of the consider of each particular rank of build
endeavor to appli such principl as mai have been demonstr to the
architectur of our countri and to discov the beau idal of english
charact which should be preserv through all the decor which
the builder mai desir and through everi varieti which fanci mai
suggest there never wa and never can be a univers beau idal in
architectur and the arriv at all local model of beauti would be the
task of ag but we can alwai in some degre determin those of our
own love countri we cannot howev in the present case pass from
the contempl of the villa of a total differ climat to the
investig of what is beauti here without the slightest refer
to style now or formerli adopt for our own villa if such thei ar
to be call and therefor it will be necessari to devot a short time
to the observ of the peculiar of such style if we possess
them or if not of the caus of their absenc
148 we have therefor head thi paper the villa england
awaken without doubt a differ idea in the mind of everi on who

locat upon the roof just under the chimnei other will go back to
the rang of elizabethan gabl but none will have ani idea of a fix
charact stamp on a class of nation edific thi is veri
melancholi and veri discourag the more so as it is not without
caus
149 in the first place britain unit in itself so mani geolog
format each give a peculiar charact to the countri which it
compos that there is hardli a district five mile broad which
preserv the same featur of landscap through it whole width24
if for exampl six foreign were to land sever at glasgow at
aberystwith at falmouth at brighton at yarmouth and at newcastl
and to confin their investig to the countri within twenti mile
of them what differ impress would thei receiv of british
landscap if therefor there be as mani form of edific as there
ar peculiar of situat we can have no nation style and if we
abandon the idea of a correspond with situat we lose the onli
criterion capabl of form a nation style25
footnot 24 length is anoth thing we might divid england into
strip of countri run southwest and northeast which would be
compos of the same rock and therefor would present the same
charact throughout the whole of their length almost all our great
road cut these transvers and therefor seldom remain for ten mile
togeth on the same bed
footnot 25 it is thu that we find the most perfect school of
architectur have arisen in district whose charact is unchang
look to egypt first we find a climat induc a perpetu state of

all of which were under the same air and partook of the same featur
of landscap in rome it becam less perfect becaus more imit
than indigen and corrupt by the travel and conquer and
steal ambit of the roman yet still a school of architectur
becaus the whole of itali present the same peculiar of scene so
with the spanish and moresco school and mani other pass over the
gothic which though we hope hereaft to show it to be no except to
the rule involv too mani complic question to be now brought
forward as a proof of it
the comparison of egyptian architectur with deliri vision seem to
be an allus to de quincei passag in the pain of opiumth last

150 anoth caus to be notic is the peculiar independ of the
englishman disposit a feel which prompt him to suit hi own
humor rather than fall in with the prevail cast of social sentiment
or of natur beauti and express and which thereforether be
much obstin origin in hi mindproduc strang varieti of
dwell frequent render still more preposter by hi love of
displai a love univers felt in england and often absurdli
indulg wealth is worship in franc as the mean of purchas
pleasur in itali as an instrument of power in england as the mean
of show off it would be a veri great sacrific inde in an
englishman of the averag stamp to put hi villa out of the wai where
nobodi would ever see it or think of him it is hi ambit to hear
everi on exclaim what a pretti place whose can it be and he
care veri littl about the peac which he ha disturb or the repos
which he ha interrupt though even while he thu push himself into
the wai he keep an air of sulki retir of hedgehog independ
about hi hous which take awai ani idea of sociabl or goodhumor
which might otherwis have been suggest by hi choic of situat
151 but in spite of all these unfortun circumst there ar
some distinct featur in our english countri hous which ar well
worth a littl attent first in the approach we have on compon
part of effect which mai be call peculiarli our own and which
requir much studi befor it can be manag wellth avenu it is
true that we meet with nobl line of timber tree crest some of the
larger bastion of continent fortifi citi we see intermin
regiment of mistleto appl tree flank the carriag road and
occasion we approach a turret chteau26 by a broad wai edg
with poplar pale but allow all thi the legitim glori of the
perfect avenu is our still as will appear by a littl consider
of the element which constitut it beauti
footnot 26 or a citi ani on who rememb enter carlsruh from
the north by the two mile of poplar avenu rememb enter the most
soulless of all citi by the most lifeless of all entranc
152 the origin idea wa given by the open of the tangl glade in
our most ancient forest it is rather a curiou circumst that in
those wood whose decai ha been most instrument in form the bog
district of ireland the tree have in gener been plant in
symmetr row at distanc of about twenti feet apart if the
arrang of our later wood be not quit so formal thei at least
present frequent open carpet with green sward and edg with
variou foliag which the architect for so mai the design of the
avenu be entitl should do littl more than reduc to symmetri and
place in posit preserv as much as possibl the manner and the
proport of natur the avenu therefor must not be too long it
is quit a mistak to suppos that there is sublim in a monoton
length of line unless inde it be carri to an extent gener
imposs as in the case of the long walk at windsor from three to
four hundr yard is a length which will displai the elev well
and will not becom tiresom from continu monotoni the kind of tree
must of cours be regul by circumst but the foliag must be
unequ dispos so as to let in passag of light across the path
and caus the motion of ani object across it to chang like an
undul melodi from dark to light it should meet at the top so
as to caus twilight but not obscur and the idea of a vault roof
without rigid the ground should be green so that the sunlight mai
tell with forc wherev it strike now thi kind of rich and shadowi
vista is found in it perfect onli in england it is an attribut of
green countri it is associ with all our memori of forest freedom
of our woodrang and yeomen with the doublet of the lincoln
green with our pride of ancient archer whose art wa foster in
such long and breezeless glade with our thought of the merri chase
of our kingli compani when the dewi antler sparkl down the
intertwin path of the windless wood at the morn echo of the
hunter horn with all in fact that onc contribut to give our land
it ancient name of merri england a name which in thi ag of steam
and iron it will have some difficulti in keep
153 thi then is the first featur we would direct attent to as
characterist in the english villa and be it rememb that we ar
not speak of the immens line of foliag which guid the ey to some
of our english palac for those ar rather the adjunct of the park
than the approach to the build but of the more lacon avenu with
the two crest column and the iron gate at it entranc lead the
ey in the space of a hundr yard or so to the gabl of it grai
mansion a good instanc of thi approach mai be found at petersham by
follow the right side of the thame for about half a mile from
richmond hill though the hous which in thi case is approach by a
nobl avenu is much to be reprehend as a bad mixtur of imit
of the italian with corrupt elizabethan though it is somewhat
instruct as show the ridicul effect of statu out of door in
a climat like our
154 and now that we have point out the kind of approach most
peculiarli english that approach will guid us to the onli style of
villa architectur which can be call englishth elizabethan and
it varietiesa style fantast in it detail and capabl of be
subject to no rule but as we think well adapt for the sceneri in
which it aros we allud not onli to the pure elizabethan but even to
the strang mixtur of classic ornament with gothic form which we
find prevail in the sixteenth centuri in the most simpl form we
have a build extend round three side of a court and in the
larger hall round sever interior court termin in sharpli
gabl front with broad oriel divid into veri narrow light by
channel mullion without decor of ani kind the roof reliev by
project dormer window whose light ar gener divid into
three termin in veri flat arch without cusp the intermedi
edg of the roof be battlement then we find wreath of ornament
introduc at the base of the oriels27 rang of short column the
base of on upon the capit of anoth run up besid them the
base be veri tall sometim decor with knot of flowerwork
the column usual flutedwreath in richer exampl with
ornament the entranc is frequent form by doubl rang of those
short column with intermedi arch with shell canopi and rich
crest above28 thi portico is carri up to some height abov the
roof which is charg with an infinit varieti of decor chimnei
footnot 27 as in a beauti exampl in brasenos colleg oxford
footnot 28 the portico of the old school and the inner court of
merton and st john colleg oxford an old hous at charlton kent
and burleigh hous will probabl occur to the mind of the architect as
good exampl of the varieti of thi mix style
155 now all thi is utterli barbar as architectur but with the
except of the chimnei it is not fals in tast for it wa
origin intend for retir and quiet habit in our forest
countri not for conspicu palac in the street of the citi and we
have shown in speak of green countri that the ey is gratified29
with fantast detail that it is prepar by the mingl light of
the natur sceneri for rich and entangl ornament and would not onli
endur but demand irregular of system in the architectur of man
to correspond with the infinit varieti of form in the wood architectur
of natur few surpris can be imagin more delight than the
break out of on of these rich gabl with it decor entranc
among the dark trunk and twinkl leav of forest sceneri such an
effect is rude given in fig 12 we would direct the attent chiefli
to the follow point in the build
footnot 29 ie when the spectat is surround by woodland
sceneri vide ant 88
156 first it is a humorist an odd twist independ be with a
great deal of mix obstin and occasion absurd origin it
ha on or two grace line about it and sever harsh and cut
on it is a whole which would allow of no unison with ani other
architectur it is gather in itself and would look veri ugli inde
if piec in a purer style of build were ad all thi correspond
with point of english charact with it humor it independ and
it horror of be put out of it own wai
157 again it is a thoroughli domest build home and
cottagelik in it prevail form awaken no elev idea
assum no nobil of form it ha none of the pride or the grace of
beauti none of the digniti of delight which we found in the villa of
itali but it is a habit of everydai life a protect from
momentari inconveni cover with stiff effort at decor and
exactli typic of the mind of it inhabit not nobl in it tast
not haughti in it recreat not pure in it percept of beauti but
domest in it pleasur fond of matteroffact rather than of
imagin yet sparkl occasion with odd wit and grotesqu
associ the italian obtain hi beauti as hi recreat with
quiet with few and nobl line with great serious and depth of
thought with veri rare interrupt to the simpl train of feel
but the englishman villa is full of effort it is a busi with him
to be play an infinit labor to be ornament he forc hi
amus with fit of contrast thought with mingl of minor
touch of humor with a good deal of sulki but with no melancholi
and therefor ow to thi last adjunct30 the build in it
origin state cannot be call beauti and we ought not to consid
the effect of it present antiqu evid of which is as wa befor
prove gener objection in a build devot to pleasure31
and is onli agreeabl here becaus unit with the memori of a depart
pride
footnot 30 name the fact that there is no melancholi in the english
playimpuls v ant 23
footnot 31 see 118 seq
158 again it is a lifelik build sparkl in it casement brisk
in it air let much light in at the wall and roof low and
comfortablelook in it door the italian dwell is much wall
in let out no secret from the insid dreari and drowsi in it
effect just such is the differ between the mind of the
inhabit the on pass awai in deep and dark reveri the other
quick and businesslik enjoi it everydai occup and activ
in it ordinari engag
159 again it is a regularli plan mechan welldisciplin
build each of it part answer to it opposit each of it
ornament match with similar the italian where it ha no high
pretens to architectur beauti is a rambl and irregular edific
vari with uncorrespond mass and the mind of the italian we find
similarli irregular a thing of variou and ungovern impuls
without fix principl of action the englishman regular and uniform
in it emot steadi in it habit and firm even in it most trivial
determin
160 lastli the size of the whole is diminut compar with the
villa of the south in which the effect wa alwai larg and gener
here the ey is drawn into the investig of particular point and
miniatur detail just as in compar the english and continent
cottag we found the on character by a minut finish and the
other by a massiv effect exactli correspond with the scale of the
featur and sceneri of their respect local
161 it appear then from a consider of these sever point
that in our antiqu style of villa architectur some nation
feel mai be discov but in ani build now rais there is no
charact whatev all is ridicul imit and despic
affect and it is much to be lament that now when a great deal
of public attent ha been direct to architectur on the part of the
public more effort ar not made to turn that attent from mimick
swiss chlet to erect english hous we need not devot more
time to the investig of pure domest english architectur
though we hope to deriv much instruct and pleasur from the
contempl of build partli adapt for defens and partli for
resid the introduct of the mean of defens is howev a
distinct which we do not wish at present to pass over and therefor
in our next paper we hope to conclud the subject of the villa by a
few remark on the style now best adapt for english sceneri
v
the english villaprincipl of composit
162 it ha late becom a custom among the more enlighten and
refin of metropolitan shopkeep to advoc the caus of proprieti
in architectur decor by ensconc their shelv counter and
clerk in classic edific agreeabl ornament with ingeni
devic typic of the class of articl to which the tradesman
particularli desir to direct the public attent we find our grocer
enshrin in templ whose column ar of canist and whose pinnacl
ar of sugarloav our shoemak shape their sole under gothic
portal with pendant of shoe and canopi of wellington and our
cheesemong will we doubt not soon follow the excel exampl by
rais shop the vari diamet of whose joint column in their
address to the ey shall awaken memori of staffa pstum and
palmyra and in their address to the tongu shall arous exquisit
associ of rememb flavor dutch stilton and strachino
163 now thi fit of tast on the part of our tradesmen is onli a
coars form of a disposit inher in the human mind those object
to which the ey ha been most frequent accustom and among which
the intellect ha form it habit of action and the soul it mode of
emot becom agreeabl to the thought from their correspond
with their prevail cast especi when the busi of life ha had
ani relat to those object for it is in the habitu and necessari
occup that the most painless hour of exist ar pass
whatev be the natur of that occup the memori belong to it
will alwai be agreeabl and therefor the object awaken such
memori will invari be found beauti whatev their charact or
form
164 it is thu that tast is the child and the slave of memori and
beauti is test not by ani fix standard but by the chanc of
associ so that in everi domest build evid will be found
of the kind of life through which it owner ha pass in the oper
of the habit of mind which that life ha induc from the
superannu coxswain who plant hi old ship figurehead in hi six
squar feet of front garden at bermondsei to the retir nobl the
proud portal of whose mansion is surmount by the broad shield and the
crest gryphon we ar all guid in our purest concept our most
ideal pursuit of the beauti by remembr of activ occup
and by principl deriv from industri regul the fanci of our
repos
165 it would be excess interest to follow out the investig
of thi subject more fulli and to show how the most refin pleasur
the most delic percept of the creatur who ha been appoint to
eat bread by the sweat of hi brow ar depend upon and intim
connect with hi hour of labor thi question howev ha no
relat to our immedi object and we onli allud to it that we mai
be abl to distinguish between the two compon part of individu
charact the on be the consequ of continu habit of life
act upon natur tempera and disposit the other be the
humor of charact consequ upon circumst altogeth
accident take stern effect upon feel previous determin by
the first part of the charact lai on as it were the finish
touch and occas the innumer prejudic fanci and
eccentr which modifi in everi individu to an infinit
extent form the visibl veil of the human heart
166 now we have defin the provinc of the architect to be that of
select such form and color as shall delight the mind by prepar
it for the oper to which it is to be subject in the build
now no form in domest architectur can thu prepar it more
distinctli than those which correspond close with the first that is
the fix and fundament part of charact which is alwai so uniform
in it action as to induc great simplic in whatev it design
noth on the contrari can be more injuri than the slightest
influenc of the humor upon the edific for the influenc of what is
fit in it energi and petti in it imagin would destroi all
the harmoni of part all the majesti of the whole would substitut
singular for beauti amus for delight and surpris for
vener we could name sever instanc of build erect by men
of the highest talent and the most perfect gener tast who yet not
have paid much attent to the first principl of architectur
permit the humor of their disposit to prevail over the majesti of
their intellect and instead of build from a fix design gratifi
freak after freak and fanci after fanci as thei were caught by the
dream or the desir mix mimicri of incongru realiti with
incorpor of undisciplin ideal awaken everi varieti of
contend feel and unconnect memori consumm confus of form
by trickeri of detail and have left barbar where half the world
will look for loveli
167 thi is a speci of error which it is veri difficult for person
pai superfici and temporari attent to architectur to avoid
howev just their tast mai be in critic it will fail in creation
it is onli in moment of eas and amus that thei will think of
their villa thei make it a mere playth and regard it with a kind of
petti exult which from it veri natur will give liberti to the
light fanci rather than the deep feel of the mind it is not
thought necessari to bestow labor of thought and period of
deliber on on of the toi of life still less to undergo the
vexat of thwart wish and leav favorit imagin
relat to minor point unfulfil for the sake of gener effect
168 thi feel then is the first to which we would direct
attent as the villa architect chief enemi he will find it
perpetu and provokingli in hi wai he is request perhap by a
man of great wealth nai of establish tast in some point to make a
design for a villa in a love situat the futur proprietor carri
him upstair to hi studi to give him what he call hi idea and
materi and in all probabl begin somewhat thusthi sir
is a slight note i made it on the spot approach to villa real near
pozzuoli danc nymph you perceiv cypress shell fountain i
think i should like someth like thi for the approach classic you
perceiv sir eleg grace then sir thi is a sketch made by
an american friend of mine wheewhawkantamaraw wigwam king of

neat i think for the front door dont you then the lower window
iv not quit decid upon but what would you sai to egyptian sir i
think i should like my window egyptian with hieroglyph sir stork

their tongu out roll up in cabbag leav with a dragon on each

be turn by octagon tower like the center on in kenilworth castl
with gothic door portculli and all quit perfect with cross slit

and a room at the top for dry plum and the conservatori at the
bottom sir with virginian creeper up the tower door support by
sphinx hold scraper in their fore paw and have their tail
prolong into warmwat pipe to keep the plant safe in winter
etc the architect is without doubt a littl astonish by these
idea and combin yet he sit calmli down to draw hi elev

169 thi is no exagger we have not onli listen to specul
on the probabl degre of the futur majesti but contempl the
actual illustri exist of sever such build with suffici
beauti in the manag of some of their featur to show that an
architect had superintend them and suffici tast in their interior
economi to prove that a refin intellect had project them and had
project a vandal onli becaus fanci had been follow instead of
judgment with as much nonchal as is evinc by a perfect poet
who is extempor doggerel for a babi full of brilliant point
which he cannot help and jumbl into confus for which he doe not
care
170 such ar the first difficulti to be encount in villa design
thei must alwai continu to occur in some degre though thei might be
met with eas by a determin on the part of profession men to give
no assist whatev beyond the mere superintend of construct
unless thei be permit to take the whole exterior design into their
own hand mere receiv broad instruct respect the style and
not attend to them unless thei like thei should not make out the
smallest detail unless thei were answer for the whole in thi
case gentlemen architect would be thrown so utterli on their own
resourc that unless those resourc were adequ thei would be
oblig to surrend the task into more practic hand and if thei
were adequ if the amateur had paid so much attent to the art as
to be capabl of give the design perfectli it is probabl he would
not erect anyth strikingli abomin
171 such a system suppos that it could be carri fulli into
effect and that there were no such anim as sentiment stonemason
to give technic assist might at first seem rather an
encroach on the liberti of the subject inasmuch as it would prevent
peopl from indulg their edificatori fanci unless thei knew
someth about the matter or as the suffer would probabl
complain from do what thei like with their own but the mistak
would evid lie in their suppos as peopl too frequent do
that the outsid of their hous is their own and that thei have a
perfect right therein to make fool of themselv in ani manner and to
ani extent thei mai think proper thi is quit true in the case of
interior everi on ha an indisput right to hold himself up as a
laughingstock to the whole circl of hi friend and acquaint and
to consult hi own privat asinin comfort by everi piec of absurd
which can in ani degre contribut to the same but no on ha ani right
to exhibit hi imbecil at other peopl expens or to claim the
public piti by inflict public pain in england especi where as
we saw befor the rage for attract observ is univers the
outsid of the villa is render by the proprietor own disposit
the properti of those who daili pass by and whom it hourli affect with
pleasur or pain for the pain which the ey feel from the violat of
a law to which it ha been accustom or the mind from the occurr
of anyth jar to it finest feel is as distinct as that
occas by the interrupt of the physic economi differ onli
inasmuch as it is not perman and therefor an individu ha as
littl right to fulfil hi own concept by disgust thousand as
were hi bodi as impenetr to steel or poison as hi brain to the
effect of the beauti or true he would have to decor hi carriag
road with caltrop or to line hi plantat with upa tree
172 the violat of gener feel would thu be unjust even were
their consult product of continu vexat to the individu
but it is not to no on is the architectur of the exterior of a
dwellinghous of so littl consequ as to it inhabit it
materi mai affect hi comfort and it condit mai touch hi pride
but for it architectur hi ey get accustom to it in a week and
after that hellen barbar or yanke ar all the same to the
domest feel ar all lost in the on name of home even the
conceit of live in a chlet or a wigwam or a pagoda cannot retain
it influenc for six month over the weak mind which alon can feel
it and the monotoni of exist becom to them exactli what it would
have been had thei never inflict a pang upon the unfortun
spectat whose unaccustom ey shrink daili from the impress to

tast
173 if these consider ar just when thei allud onli to build
in the abstract how much more when refer to them as materi of
composit materi of infinit power to adorn or destroi the
loveli of the earth the nobler sceneri of that earth is the
inherit of all her inhabit it is not mere for the few to whom
it temporarili belong to feed from like swine or to stabl upon like
hors but it ha been appoint to be the school of the mind which
ar kingli among their fellow to excit the highest energi of
human to furnish strength to the lordliest intellect and food for
the holiest emot of the human soul the presenc of life is inde
necessari to it beauti but of life congeni with it charact and
that life is not congeni which thrust presumptu forward amidst
the calm of the univers the confus of it own petti interest
and grovel imagin and stand up with the insol of a
moment amid the majesti of all time to build babi fortif upon
the bone of the world or to sweep the cops from the corri and the
shadow from the shore that fool mai risk and gambler gather the
spoil of a thousand summer
174 it should therefor be rememb by everi proprietor of land in
hill countri that hi possess ar the mean of a peculiar
educ otherwis unattain to the artist and in some degre to
the literari men of hi countri that even in thi limit point of
view thei ar a nation possess but much more so when it is
rememb how mani thousand ar perpetu receiv from them not
mere a transitori pleasur but such thrill perpetu of pure
emot such lofti subject for scientif specul and such deep
lesson of natur religion as onli the work of a deiti can impress
and onli the spirit of an immort can feel thei should rememb that
the slightest deform the most contempt excresc can injur
the effect of the noblest natur sceneri as a note of discord can
annihil the express of the purest harmoni that thu it is in the
power of worm to conceal to destroi or to violat what angel could
not restor creat or consecr and that the right which everi man
unquestion possess to be an ass is extend onli in public to
those who ar innoc in idiot not to the more malici clown
who thrust their degrad motlei conspicu forth amidst the fair
color of earth and mix their incoher cri with the melodi of
etern break with their inan laugh upon the silenc which creation
keep where omnipot pass most visibl and scrabbl over with the
charact of idioci the page that have been written by the finger of
god
175 these feel we would endeavor to impress upon all person like
to have anyth to do with embellish as it is call fine natur
sceneri as thei might in some degre convinc both the architect and
hi employ of the danger of give free plai to the imagin in
case involv intric question of feel and composit and
might persuad the design of the necess of look not to hi own
acr of land or to hi own peculiar tast but to the whole mass of
form and combin of impress with which he is surround
176 let us suppos howev that the design is yield entir to the
architect discret be a piec of domest architectur the
chief object in it exterior design will be to arous domest feel
which as we saw befor it will do most distinctli by correspond
with the first part of charact yet it is still more necessari that it
should correspond with it situat and henc aris anoth
difficulti the reconcili of correspond with contrari for
such it is deepli to be regret ar too often the individu mind
and the dwellingplac it choos the polish courtier bring hi
refin and duplic with him to ap the arcadian rustic in

endeavor to rise at seven in some ultima thule of frost and storm
and the rich stockjobb calcul hi percentag among the soft
dingl and woodi shore of westmoreland when the architect find thi
to be the case he must of cours content himself with suit hi
design to such a mind as ought to be where the intrud is for the
feel which ar so much at varianc with themselv in the choic of
situat will not be found too critic of their domicil howev
littl suit to their temper
177 if possibl howev he should aim at someth more he should
draw hi employ into gener convers observ the bent of hi
disposit and the habit of hi mind notic everi manifest of
fix opinion and then transfer to hi architectur as much of the
feel he ha observ as is distinct in it oper thi he should
do not becaus the gener spectat will be awar of the apt of
the build which know noth of it inmat he cannot be nor to
pleas the individu himself which it is a chanc if ani simpl design
ever will and who never will find out how well hi charact ha been
fit but becaus a portrait is alwai more spirit than a compos
counten and becaus thi studi of human passion will bring a
degre of energi uniti and origin into everi on of hi design
all of which will necessarili be differ so simpl so domest
and so lifelik as to strike everi spectat with an interest and a
sympathi for which he will be utterli unabl to account and to impress
on him a percept of someth more ether than stone or carv
somewhat similar to that which some will rememb have felt
disagre in their childhood on look at ani old hous
authent haunt the architect will forget in hi studi of life
the formal of scienc and while hi practic ey will prevent
him from er in technic he will advanc with the rule
feel which in mass of mind is nation to the concept of
someth truli origin yet perfectli pure
178 he will also find hi advantag in have obtain a guid in the
invent of decor of which as we shall show we would have mani
more in english villa than economi at present allow candidus33
complain in hi note book that elizabethan architectur is frequent
adopt becaus it is easi with a pair of scissor to deriv a zigzag
ornament from a doubl piec of paper but we would fain hope that none
of our profession architect have so far lost sight of the mean of
their art as to believ that roughen stone mathemat is
bestow decor though we ar too sternli convinc that thei
believ mankind to be more shortsight by at least thirti yard than
thei ar for thei think of noth but gener effect in their
ornament and lai on their flowerwork so carelessli that a good

179 now there is noth which requir studi so close or experi
so frequent as the proper design of ornament for it us and
posit some definit rule mai be given but when the space and
posit have been determin the line of curvatur the breadth
depth and sharp of the shadow to be obtain the junction of the
part of a group and the gener express will present question for
the solut of which the studi of year will sometim scarc be
sufficient34 for thei depend upon the feel of the ey and hand
and there is noth like perfect in decor noth which in
all probabl might not by farther consider be improv now
in case in which the outlin and larger mass ar determin by
situat the architect will frequent find it necessari to fall
back upon hi decor as the onli mean of obtain charact and
that which befor wa an unmean lump of jag freeston will becom
a part of express an accessori of beauti design vari in it
form and delic in it effect then instead of shrink from hi
bit of ornament as from thing which will give him troubl to invent
and will answer no other purpos than that of occupi what would
otherwis have look blank the design will view them as an effici
corp de reserv to be brought up when the ey come to close
quarter with the edific to maintain and deepen the impress it ha
previous receiv much more time will be spent in the concept
much more labor in the execut of such mean ornament but both
will be well spent and well reward

gothic chapel a month of invent and a botan garden to work from
with perfect certainti that he would not at the expir of the time
be abl to present us with on design of leafag equal in beauti to
hundr we could point out in the capit and nich of melros and
roslin
180 perhap our mean mai be made more clear by fig 13 a which is
that of a window found in a domest build of mix and corrupt
architectur at munich which we give now becaus we shall have
occas to allud to it hereaft it absurd breadth of mold so
disproportion to it cornic render it excess ugli but
capabl of great varieti of effect it form on of a rang of four
turn an angl whose mold join each other their doubl breadth
be the whole separ of the apertur which ar someth more
than doubl squar now by alter of the decor and depth of
shadow we have b and c these three window differ entir in their
feel and manner and ar broad exampl of such distinct of style
as might be adopt sever in the habit of the man of
imagin the man of intellect and the man of feeling35 if our
alter have been properli made there will be no difficulti in
distinguish between their express which we shall therefor leav
to conjectur the charact of a depend upon the soft with which
the light is caught upon it ornament which should not have a singl
hard line in them and on the gradual unequ but intens depth of
it shadow b should have all it form undefin and pass into on
anoth the touch of the chisel light a grotesqu face or featur
occur in part the shadow pale but broad36 and the boldest
part of the carv kept in shadow rather than light the third should
be hard in it line strong in it shade and quiet in it ornament
footnot 35 though not in thi order c is the intellectu window
b the imagin on
footnot 36 it is too much the custom to consid a design as compos
of a certain number of hard line instead of a certain number of
shadow of variou depth and dimens though these shadow chang
their posit in the cours of the dai thei ar rel alwai the
same thei have most varieti under a strong light without sun most
express with the sun a littl observ of the infinit varieti of

hi effect we shall have occas to allud to thi subject again

181 these hint will be suffici to explain our mean and we have
not space to do more as the object of these paper is rather to observ
than to advis besid in question of express so intric it is
almost imposs to advanc fix principl everi mind will have
percept of it own which will guid it specul everi hand
and ey and peculiar feel vari even from year to year we have
onli start the subject of correspond with individu charact
becaus we think that imagin mind might take up the idea with some
success as furnish them with a guid in the variat of their
design more certain than mere experi on unmean form or than
ring indiscrimin chang on compon part of establish beauti
to the reveri rather than the investig to the dream rather than

speak of the cottag the effect of which ow to it size can
extend onli over a limit space and thi space if in picturesqu blue
countri must be either part of it monoton cultiv when it is
to be consid as belong to the simpl blue countri or part of it
dingl sceneri when it becom green countri and it would not be just
to suit a cottag actual place in on color to the gener effect
of anoth color with which it could have noth to do but the effect
of the villa extend veri often over a consider space and becom
part of the larg featur of the district so that the whole charact
and express of the visibl landscap must be consid and thu the
distinct between the two kind of blue countri becom absolut
necessari of the first or simpl we have alreadi adduc as an
exampl the greater part of the south of england of the second or
picturesqu the cultiv part of the north and east ride of
yorkshir gener shropshir and the north of lancashir and
cumberland beyond caldbeck fell ar good exampl perhap better
than all the countri for twelv mile north and thirti south east
and west of stirl
a the simpl blue countri
185 now the matteroffact businesslik activ of simpl blue
countri ha been alreadi allud to thi attribut render in it a
plain palpabl brick dwellinghous allow though a thing which in
everi countri but the simpl blue compel everi spectat of ani
feel to send up aspir that builder who like those of babel
have brick for stone mai be put like those of babel to confus
here howev it is not onli allow but even agreeabl for the
follow reason
186 it clean and fresh of color admit of littl damp
or stain firm in it consist not molder like stone and
therefor induc no convict of antiqu or decai present rather
the appear of such comfort as is contriv for the enjoy of
temporari wealth than of such solid as is rais for the inherit
of unfluctu power it is thu admir suit for that countri
where all is chang and all activ where the work and
moneymak member of the commun ar perpetu succeed and
overpow each other enjoi each in hi turn the reward of hi
industri yield up the field the pastur and the mine to hi
successor and leav no more memori behind him no farther evid of
hi individu exist than is left by a work bee in the honei
for which we thank hi class forget the individu the simpl blue
countri mai in fact be consid the diningt of the nation from
which it provid for it immedi necess at which it feel onli
it present exist and in which it requir not a piec of
furnitur adapt onli to remind it of past refect but a polish
clean and conveni minist to it immedi wish no habit
therefor in thi countri should look old it should give an
impress of present prosper of swift motion and high energi of
life too rapid in it success oper to attain great or
allow of decai in it work thi is the first caus which in thi
countri render brick allow
187 again wherev the soil break out in simpl blue countri whether
in the river shore or the broken roadsid bank or the plow field in
nine case out of ten it is excess warm in it color be either
gravel or clai the black veget soil never remain free of
veget the warm tone of these bed of soil is an admir relief
to the blue of the distanc which we have taken as the distinct
featur of the countri tend to produc the perfect light without
which no landscap can be complet therefor the red of the brick is
prevent from glare upon the ey by it fall in with similar
color in the ground and contrast fine with the gener tone of
the distanc thi is anoth instanc of the materi which natur most
readili furnish be the right on in almost all blue countri we
have onli to turn out a few spade of loos soil and we come to the
bed of clai which is the best materi for the build wherea we
should have to travel hundr of mile or to dig thousand of feet to
get the stone which natur doe not want and therefor ha not given
188 anoth excel in brick is it perfect air of english
respect it is utterli imposs for an edific altogeth of
brick to look affect or absurd it mai look rude it mai look vulgar
it mai look disgust in a wrong place but it cannot look foolish
for it is incap of pretens we mai suppos it master a brute or
an ignoramu but we can never suppos him a coxcomb a bear he mai be
a fop he cannot be and if we find him out of hi place we feel that
it is ow to error not to impud to selfignor not to
selfconceit to the want not the assumpt of feel it is thu
that brick is peculiarli english in it effect for we ar brute in
mani thing and we ar ignoramus in mani thing and we ar destitut
of feel in mani thing but we ar not coxcomb it is onli by the
utmost effort that some of our most highli gift junior gentlemen can
attain such distinct of titl and even then the honor sit ill upon
them thei ar but awkward coxcomb affectation37 never wa and
never will be a part of english charact we have too much nation
pride too much conscious of our own digniti and power too much
establish selfsatisfact to allow us to becom ridicul by
imit effort and as it is onli by endeavor to appear what he
is not that a man ever can becom so properli speak our
truewit continent neighbor who shrink from john bull as a brute
never laugh at him as a fool il est bte il nest pa pourtant sot
footnot 37 the nation inde possess on or two interest
individu whose affect is as we have seen strikingli
manifest in their lake villa but everi rule ha it except and
even on these gift personag the affect sit so veri awkwardli
so like a velvet bonnet on a plowman carroti hair that it is
evid a late acquisit thu on proprietor of land on
windermer who ha built unto himself a castel mansion with round
tower and a swiss cottag for a stabl ha yet with that admir
of the neat but not gaudi which is commonli report to have
influenc the devil when he paint hi tail peagreen paint the
rock at the back of hi hous pink that thei mai look clean thi is a
littl outcrop of english feel in the midst of the assum romanc
189 the brick hous admir correspond with thi part of english
charact for unabl as it is to be beauti or grace or
dignifi it is equal unabl to be absurd there is a proud
independ about it which seem consciou of it entir and perfect
applic to those us for which it wa built and full of a
goodnatur intent to render everi on who seek shelter within it
wall excess comfort it therefor feel awkward in no compani
and wherev it intrud it goodhumor red face stare plaster and
marbl out of counten with an insens audac which we drive
out of such refin compani as we would a clown from a drawingroom
but which we nevertheless seek in it own place as we would seek the
convers of the clown in hi own turnipfield if he were sensibl
in the main
190 lastli brick is admir adapt for the climat of england and
for the frequent manufactur nuisanc of english blue countri for
the smoke which make marbl look like charcoal and stucco like mud
onli render brick less glare in it color and the inclement climat
which make the composit front look as if it architect had been
amus himself by throw bucket of green water down from the roof
and befor which the granit base of stirl castl is molder into
sand as impot as ever wa rib by rippl wreak it rage in vain
upon the bit of bake clai leav them strong and dry and
stainless warm and comfort in their effect even when neglect ha
permit the moss and wallflow to creep into their cranni and
mellow into someth like beauti that which is alwai comfort damp
which fill mani stone as it would a spong is defi by the brick
and the warmth of everi gleam of sunshin is caught by it and store up
for futur expenditur so that both actual and in it effect it is
peculiarli suit for a climat whose chang ar in gener from bad to
wors and from wors to bad
191 these then ar the princip apolog which the brick
dwellinghous ha to offer for it ugli thei will howev onli
stand it in stead in the simpl blue countri and even there onli when
the follow point ar observ
first the brick should neither be of the white nor the veri dark red
kind the white is wors than useless as a color it cold raw sandi
neutral ha neither warmth enough to reliev nor grai enough to
harmon with ani natur tone it doe not pleas the ey by warmth
in shade it hurt it by dry heat in sun it ha none of the advantag
of effect which brick mai have to compens for the vulgar which it
must have and is altogeth to be abhor the veri bright red again
is on of the ugliest warm color that art ever stumbl upon it is
never mellow by damp or anyth els and spoil everyth near it
by it intoler and inevit glare the moder dark brick of a
neutral red is to be chosen and thi after a year or two will be
farther soften in it color by atmospher influenc and will possess
all the advantag we have enumer it is almost unnecessari to point
out it fit for a damp situat not onli as the best materi for
secur the comfort of the inhabit but becaus it will the sooner
contract a certain degre of soft of tone occas by microscop
veget which will leav no more brickr than is agreeabl to the
feel where the atmospher is chill
192 secondli even thi kind of red is a veri power color and as
in combin with the other primit color veri littl of it will
complet the light so veri littl will answer everi purpos in
landscap composit and everi addit abov that littl will be
disagre brick therefor never should be us in larg group of
build where those group ar to form part of landscap sceneri two
or three hous partli shade with tree ar all that can be admit
at onc there is no object more villain destruct of natur
beauti than a larg town of veri red brick with veri scarlet tile
veri tall chimnei and veri few tree while there ar few object that
harmon more agreeabl with the feel of english ordinari landscap
than the larg old solitari brick manor hous with it group of dark
cedar on the lawn in front and the tall wroughtiron gate open
down the avenu of approach
193 thirdli no stone quoin or presenc of ani contrast color
should be admit quoin in gener though by the by thei ar
prettili manag in the old tolbooth of glasgow and some other antiqu
build in scotland ar onli excus as give an appear of
strength while their zigzag monotoni when render conspicu by
differ of color is altogeth detest white cornic nich
and the other superflu introduct in stone and plaster which some
architect seem to think ornament onli mock what thei cannot mend
take awai the whole express of the edific render the brickr
glare and harsh and becom themselv ridicul in isol
besid as a gener principl contrast of extens color ar to be
avoid in all build and especi in posit and unmanag
tint it is difficult to imagin whenc the custom of put stone
ornament into brick build could have arisen unless it be an
imit of the italian custom of mix marbl with stucco which
afford it no sanction as the marbl is onli distinguish from the
gener materi by the sharp of the carv edg the dutch seem to
have been the origin of the custom and by the by if we rememb
right in on of the veri finest piec of color now extant a
landscap by ruben in the galleri at munich we think the artist
seem to have sanction the barbar by introduc a brick edific
with white stone quoin but the truth is that he select the
subject partli under the influenc of domest feel the place
be as it is thought hi own habit and partli as a piec of
practic present such excess difficulti of color as he the
lord of color who alon could overcom them would peculiarli delight
in overcom and the harmoni with which he ha combin tint of the
most dare forc and sharpest appar contrast in the edgi build
and oppos them to an uninterest distanc of excess azur simpl
blue countri observ is on of the chief wonder of the paint so
that thi masterpiec can no more furnish an apolog for the continu
of a practic which though it give some liveli of charact to the
warehous of amsterdam is fit onli for a place whose foundat ar
mud and whose inhabit ar partial anim cheesesthan
caravaggio custom of paint blackguard should introduc an ambit
among mankind in gener of becom fit subject for hi pencil we
shall have occas again to allud to thi subject in speak of
dutch street effect
194 fourthli it will gener be found to agre best with the
businesslik air of the blue countri if the hous be excess
simpl and appar altogeth the minist of util but where it
is to be extens or tall a few decor about the upper window
ar desir these should be quiet and sever in their line and cut
boldli in the brick itself some of the minor street in the king of
sardinia capit ar altogeth of brick veri richli charg with
carv with excel effect and furnish a veri good model of cours
no delic ornament can be obtain and no classic line can be
allow for we should be horrifi by see that in brick which we
have been accustom to see in marbl the architect must be left to hi
own tast for lai on sparingli and carefulli a few disposit of
well proport line which ar all that can ever be requir
195 these broad principl ar all that need be attend to in simpl
blue countri anyth will look well in it which is not affect and
the architect who keep comfort and util steadili in view and run
off into no expati of fanci need never be afraid here of fall
into error
b the picturesqu blue countri
196 but the case is differ with the picturesqu blue country38
here ow to the caus mention in the note at p 71 we have some
of the most elev bit of landscap charact which the countri
whatev it mai be can afford it first and most distinct
peculiar is it grace it is all undul and varieti of line on
curv pass into anoth with the most exquisit soft roll
awai into faint and far outlin of variou depth and decis yet none
hard or harsh and in all probabl round off in the near ground
into massi form of partial wood hill shade downward into wind
dingl or cliffi ravin each form melt impercept into the
next without an edg or angl
footnot 38 in leav simpl blue countri we hope it need hardli be
said that we leav brick at onc and forev noth can excus them
out of their proper territori
197 it next charact is mysteri it is a countri peculiarli
distinguish by it possess featur of great sublim in the
distanc without give ani hint in the foreground of their actual
natur a rang of mountain seen from a mountain peak mai have
sublim but not the mysteri with which it is invest when seen
rise over the farthest surg of misti blue where everyth near is
soft and smile total separ in natur from the consolid
cloud of the horizon the picturesqu blue countri is sure from the
natur of the ground to present some distanc of thi kind so as never
to be without a high and ether mysteri
198 the third and last distinct attribut is sensual thi is a
startl word and requir some explan in the first place everi
line is voluptu float and wavi in it form deep rich and
exquisit soft in it color drowsi in it effect like slow wild
music let the ey repos on it as on a wreath of cloud without
on featur of harsh to hurt or of contrast to awaken in the
second place the cultiv which in the simpl blue countri ha
the forc formal of growth which evid is to suppli the
necess of man here seem to leap into the spontan luxuri
of life which is fit to minist to hi pleasur the surfac of
the earth exult with anim especi tend to the gratif
of the sens and without the artifici which remind man of the
necess of hi own labor without the oppos influenc which call
for hi resist without the vast energi that remind him of hi
impot without the sublim that can call hi noblest thought into
action yet with everi perfect that can tempt him to indol of
enjoy and with such abund bestow of natur gift as might
seem to prevent that indol from be it own punish the earth
appear to have becom a garden of delight wherein the sweep of the
bright hill without chasm or crag the flow of the bend river
without rock or rapid and the fruit of the fair earth without
care or labor on the part of it inhabit appeal to the most
pleasant passion of ey and sens call for no effort of bodi and
impress no fear on the mind in hill countri we have a struggl to
maintain with the element in simpl blue we have not the luxuri
of delight here and here onli all natur combin to breath over us
a lull slumber through which life degener into sensat
199 these consider ar suffici to explain what we mean by the
epithet sensual now take these three distinct attribut
the mysteri the grace and the voluptu what is the whole
charact veri nearlyth greek for these attribut common to all
picturesqu blue countri ar modifi in the degre of their presenc
by everi climat in england thei ar all low in their tone but as we
go southward the voluptu becom deeper in feel as the color
of the earth and the heaven becom purer and more passion and the
purpl of ocean deepest of dye the mysteri becom mightier for the
greater and more univers energi of the beauti permit it featur
to come nearer and to rise into the sublim without caus fear it
is thu that we get the essenc of the greek feel as it wa embodi
in their finest imagin as it show itself in the work of their
sculptor and their poet in which sensat wa made almost equal with
thought and deifi by it nobil of associ at onc voluptu
refin dreamili mysteri infinit beauti henc it appear
that the spirit of thi blue countri is essenti greek though in
england and in other northern local that spirit is possess by it
in a diminish and degrad degre it is also the natur dominion of
the villa possess all the attribut which attract the roman
when in their hour of idl thei lift the light arch along the
echo promontori of tiber it is especi suit to the express
of the edific of pleasur and therefor is most capabl of be
adorn by it
200 the attent of everi on about to rais himself a villa of ani
kind should therefor be direct to thi kind of countri first as
that in which he will not be felt to be an intrud secondli as that
which will in all probabl afford him the greatest degre of
continu pleasur when hi ey ha becom accustom to the featur
of the local to the human mind as on the averag constitut the
featur of hill sceneri will by repetit becom tiresom and of
wood sceneri monoton while the simpl blue can possess littl
interest of ani kind power intellect will gener take perpetu
delight in hill resid but the gener mind soon feel itself
oppress with a peculiar melancholi and weari which it is asham
to own and we hear our romant gentlemen begin to call out about the
want of societi while if the anim were fit to live where thei have
forc themselv thei would never want more societi than that of a
grai stone or of a clear pool of gush water on the other hand
there ar few mind so degrad as not to feel greater pleasur in the
picturesqu blue than in ani other countri it distanc ha gener
grandeur enough to meet their mood of aspir it near aspect is
that of a more human interest than that of hill countri and harmon
more truli with the domest feel which ar common to all mankind
so that on the whole it will be found to maintain it fresh of
beauti to the habitu ey in a greater degre than ani other
sceneri
201 as it thu persuad us to inhabit it it becom a point of honor
not to make the attract of it beauti it destruct especi
as be the natur dominion of the villa it afford great
opportun for the architect to exhibit varieti of design
it spirit ha been prove to be greek and therefor though that
spirit is slightli manifest in britain and though everi good
architect is shy of import villa on greek and roman model ar
admiss here still as in all blue countri there is much activ of
life the principl of util should be kept in view and the build
should have as much simplic as can be unit with perfect
grace of line it appear from the principl of composit
allud to in speak of the italian villa that in undul countri
the form should be squar and massi and where the segment of curv
ar small the build should be low and flat while thei mai be
prevent from appear cumbrou by some wellmanag irregular of
design which will be agreeabl to the inhabit as well as to the
spectat enabl him to chang the aspect and size of hi chamber as
temperatur or employ mai render such chang desir without
be foil in hi design by find the apart of on wing
match foot to foot by those of the other
202 for the color it ha been shown that white or pale tint ar
agreeabl in all blue countri but there must be warmth in it and a
great deal toograi be comfortless and useless with a cold
distanc but it must not be raw or glaring39 the roof and chimnei
should be kept out of sight as much as possibl and therefor the on
veri flat and the other veri plain we ought to reviv the greek custom
of roof with thin slab of coars marbl cut into the form of tile
howev where the architect find he ha a veri cool distanc and few
tree about the build and where it stand so high as to preclud the
possibl of it be look down upon he will if he be courag
us a veri flat roof of the dark italian tile the eav which ar all
that should be seen will be peculiarli grace and the sharp contrast
of color for thi tile can onli be admit with white wall mai be
altogeth avoid by let them cast a strong shadow and by run
the wall up into a rang of low garret window to break the horizont
line of the roof he will thu obtain a bit of veri strong color which
will impart a gener glow of cheer to the build and which
if he manag it rightli will not be glare nor intrus it is to
be observ howev that he can onli do thi with villa of the most
humbl order and that he will seldom find hi employ possess of so
much common sens as to put up with a tile roof when thi is the case
the flat slab of the upper limeston ragston ar usual better than
slate
footnot 39 the epithet raw by the by is vagu and need
definit everi tint is raw which is perfectli opaqu and ha not all
the three primit color in it composit thu black is alwai
raw becaus it ha no color white never becaus it ha all color no
tint can be raw which is not opaqu and opac mai be taken awai
either by actual depth and transpar as in the sky by luster and
textur as in the case of silk and velvet or by varieti of shade as in
forest verdur two instanc will be suffici to prove the truth of
thi brick when first fire is alwai raw but when it ha been a
littl weather it acquir a slight blue tint assist by the grai
of the mortar incipi veget afford it the yellow it thu
obtain an admixtur of the three color and is raw no longer an old
woman red cloak though glare is never raw for it must of
necess have fold shade those shade ar of a rich grai no grai
can exist without yellow and blue we have then three color and no
raw it must be observ howev that when ani on of the color is
given in so slight a degre that it can be overpow by certain
effect of light the unit color when opaqu will be raw thu mani
fleshcolor ar raw becaus though thei must have a littl blue in
their composit it is too littl to be effici visibl in a
strong light
203 for the rest it is alwai to be kept in view that the prevail
charact of the whole is to be that of grace simplic
distinguish from the simplic of the italian edific by be that
of util instead of that of pride40 consequ the build must
not be gothic or elizabethan it mai be as commonplac as the
proprietor like provid it proport be good but noth can ever
excus on acut angl or on decor pinnacleboth be direct
interrupt of the repos with which the ey is indulg by the
undul of the surround sceneri tower and fortress outlin ar
inde agreeabl for their fine group and round but we do not
allud to them becaus noth can be more absurd than the humor
prevail at the present dai among mani of our peaceabl old gentlemen
who never smelt powder in their live to eat their morn muffin in a
savagelook round tower and admit quiet old ladi to a teaparti
under the rang of twentysix cannon whichit is lucki for the
chinaar all wooden onesa thei ar in all probabl accur
and awfulli point into the drawingroom window
footnot 40 there must alwai be a difficulti in build in
picturesqu blue countri in england for the english charact is
oppos to that of the countri it is neither grace nor mysteri
nor voluptu therefor what we cede to the countri we take from the
nation and vice ver
so much then for our british blue countri to which it wa necessari to
devot some time as occupi a consider portion of the island and
be peculiarli well adapt for villa resid
c the woodi or green countri
204 the woodi or green countri which is next in order wa spoken of
befor and wa shown to be especi our own the elizabethan wa
point out as the style peculiarli belong to it and farther
critic of that style wa defer until we came to the consider
of domest build provid with the mean of defens we have
therefor at present onli to offer a few remark on the principl to be
observ in the erect of elizabethan villa at the present dai
205 first the build must be either quit chast or excess
rich in decor everi inch of ornament short of a certain quantiti
will render the whole effect poor and ridicul while the pure
perpendicular line of thi architectur will alwai look well if left
entir alon the architect therefor when limit as to expens
should content himself with make hi oriel project boldli channel
their mullion richli and in gener render hi vertic line
delic and beauti in their workmanship but if hi estim be
unlimit he should lai on hi ornament richli take care never to
confus the ey
those part to which of necess observ is especi direct
must be finish so as to bear a close scrutini that the ey mai rest
on them with satisfact but their finish must not be of a charact
which would have attract the ey by itself without be place in a
conspicu situat for if it were the unit attract of form
and detail would confin the contempl altogeth to the part so
distinguish and render it imposs for the mind to receiv ani
impress of gener effect
consequ the part that project and ar to bear a strong light
must be chisel with infinit delicaci so that the ornament though it
would have remain unobserv had the ey not been guid to it when
observ mai be of distinguish beauti and power but those part
which ar to be flat and in shade should be mark with great sharp
and bold that the impress mai be equal
when for instanc we have to do with oriel to which attent is
immedi attract by their project we mai run wreath of the
finest flowerwork up the mullion charg the termin with
shield and quarter them richli but we must join the window to the
wall where it shadow fall by mean of more deep and decid
decor
206 secondli in the choic and design of hi ornament the architect
should endeavor to be grotesqu rather than grace though littl bit
of soft flowerwork here and there will reliev the ey but he must
not imagin he can be grotesqu by carv face with hole for ey and
knob for nose on the contrari whenev he mimic grotesqu life
there should be wit and humor in everi featur fun and frolic in everi
attitud everi distort should be anatom and everi monster a
studi combin thi is a question howev relat more nearli
to gothic architectur and therefor we shall not enter into it at
present41
footnot 41 see stone of venic vol iii chap iii
207 thirdli the gabl must on no account be jag into a success
of right angl as if peopl were to be perpetu engag in trot
up on side and down the other thi custom though sanction by
author ha veri littl apolog to offer for itself base on ani
principl of composit in street effect inde it is occasion
us and where the vertic below ar unbroken by ornament mai be
us even in the detach elizabethan but not when decor ha been
permit below thei should then be carri up in curv line
altern with two angl or three at the most without pinnacl or
hipknob a hollow parapet is far better than a battlement in the
intermedi space the latter inde is never allow except when
the build ha some appear of be intend for defens and
therefor is gener barbar in the villa while the parapet admit
of great varieti of effect
208 lastli though the grotesqu of elizabethan architectur is
adapt for wood countri the grotesqu of the clip garden which
frequent accompani it is not the custom of clip tree into
fantast form is alwai to be reprehend first becaus it never can
produc the true grotesqu for the materi is not passiv and
therefor a perpetu sens of restraint is induc while the great
principl of the grotesqu is action again becaus we have a distinct
percept of two natur the on neutral the other for the
veget organ is too palpabl to let the anim form suggest
it true idea again becaus the great beauti of all foliag is the
energi of life and action of which it lose the appear by formal
clip and again becaus the hand of the garden will never
produc anyth realli spirit or grace much howev need not be
said on thi subject for the tast of the public doe not now prompt
them to such fetter of fair freedom and we should be as sorri to see
the characterist vestig of it which still remain in a few garden
lost altogeth as to see the thing again becom common
209 the garden of the elizabethan villa then should be laid out with
a few simpl terrac near the hous so as to unit it well with the
ground line of balustrad along the edg guid awai into the
foliag of the taller tree of the garden with the shadow fall at
interv the balust should be squar rather than round with the
angl outward and if the balustrad look unfinish at the corner
it mai be surmount by a grotesqu bit of sculptur of ani kind but
it must be veri strong and deep in it carv line and must not be
larg and all grace statu ar to be avoid for the reason
mention in speak of the italian villa neither is the terrac part
of the garden to extend to ani distanc from the hous nor to have deep
flight of step for thei ar sure to get mossi and slipperi if not
superintend with troublesom care and the rest of the garden should
have more tree than flower in it a flowergarden is an ugli thing
even when best manag it is an assembl of unfortun be
pamper and bloat abov their natur size stew and heat into
diseas growth corrupt by evil commun into speckl and
inharmoni color torn from the soil which thei love and of which
thei were the spirit and the glori to glare awai their term of
torment life among the mix and incongru essenc of each other
in earth that thei know not and in air that is poison to them
210 the florist mai delight in thi the true lover of flower never
will he who ha taken lesson from natur who ha observ the real
purpos and oper of flower how thei flush forth from the
bright of the earth be as the melodi rise up from among the
move string of the instrument how the wild of their pale color
pass over her like the evid of a variou emot how the quick
fire of their life and their delight glow along the green bank where
the dew fall the thickest and the mist of incens pass slowli through
the twilight of the leav and the intertwin root make the earth
trembl with strang joi at the feel of their motion he who ha
watch thi will never take awai the beauti of their be to mix into
meretrici glare or feed into an exist of diseas and the
flowergarden is as ugli in effect as it is unnatur in feel it
never will harmon with anyth and if peopl will have it should
be kept out of sight till thei get into it
211 but in lai out the garden which is to assist the effect of the
build we must observ and exclus us the natur combin
of flowers42 now as far as we ar awar bluish purpl is the onli
flower color which natur ever us in mass of distant effect thi
howev she doe in the case of most heather with the rhododendron
ferrugineum and less extens with the colder color of the wood
hyacinth accordingli the larg rhododendron mai be us to almost ani
extent in mass the pale varieti of the rose more sparingli and
on the turf the wild violet and pansi should be sown by chanc so that
thei mai grow in undul of color and should be reliev by a few
primros all dahlia tulip ranunculi and in gener what ar
call florist flower should be avoid like garlic
footnot 42 everi on who is about to lai out a limit extent of
garden in which he wish to introduc mani flower should read and
attent studi first shellei and next shakspear the latter inde
induc the most beauti connect between thought and flower that
can be found in the whole rang of european literatur but he veri
often us the symbol effect of the flower which it can onli have
on the educ mind instead of the natur and true effect of the
flower which it must have more or less upon everi mind thu when
ophelia present her wild flower sai there rosemari that
for remembr prai you love rememb and there is pansi that
for thought the infinit beauti of the passag depend entir upon
the arbitrari mean attach to the flower but when shellei speak
of
the lili of the vale
whom youth make so fair and passion so pale
that the light of her tremul bell is seen
through their pavilion of tender green
he is ether an impress which the mind natur receiv from
the flower consequ as it is onli by their natur influenc that
flower can address the mind through the ey we must read shellei to
learn how to us flower and shakspear to learn to love them in both
writer we find the wild flower possess soul as well as life and
mingl it influenc most intim like an untaught melodi with
the deepest and most secret stream of human emot
212 perhap we should apolog for introduc thi in the
architectur magazin but it is not out of place the garden is
almost a necessari adjunct of the elizabethan villa and all garden
architectur is utterli useless unless it be assist by the botan
effect
these then ar a few of the more import principl of architectur
which ar to be kept in view in the blue and in the green countri the
wild or grai countri is never select in britain as the site of a
villa and therefor it onli remain for us to offer a few remark on
a subject as difficult as it is interest and import the

213 in the boulevard de italien just at the turn into the rue de
la paix in pari there stand a few duski and wither tree besid a
kind of dry ditch pave at the bottom into which a carriag can with
some difficulti descend and which afford access not in an unusu
manner to the ground floor of a larg and drearylook hous whose
passag ar dark and confin whose room ar limit in size and
whose window command an interest view of the duski tree befor
mention
thi is the town resid of on of the italian noblemen whose countri
hous ha alreadi been figur as a beauti exampl of the villa of
the lago di como that villa howev though in on of the loveliest
situat that hill and wave and heaven ever combin to adorn and
though itself on of the most delici habit that luxuri ever
project or wealth procur is veri rare honor by the presenc of
it master while attract of a veri differ natur retain him
winter after winter in the dark chamber of the boulevard de italien
214 thi appear singular to the casual travel who dart down from
the dust and heat of the french capit to the light and glori of the
italian lake and find the tall marbl chamber and orang grove in
which he think were he possess of them he could luxuri forev
left desol and neglect by their real owner but were he to try
such a resid for a singl twelvemonth we believ hi wonder would
have greatli diminish at the end of the time for the mind of the
nobleman in question doe not differ from that of the averag of men
inasmuch as it is a wellknown fact that a seri of sublim
impress continu indefinit gradual pall upon the
imagin deaden it fine of feel and in the end induc a
gloomi and morbid state of mind a reaction of a peculiarli melancholi
charact becaus consequ not upon the absenc of that which onc
caus excit but upon the failur of it power43 thi is not
the case with all men but with those over whom the sublim of an
unchang scene can retain it power forev we have noth to do
for thei know better than ani architect can how to choos their scene
and how to add to it effect we have onli to impress upon them the
proprieti of think befor thei build and of keep their humor
under the control of their judgment

215 it is not of them but of the man of averag intellect that we ar
think throughout all these paper and upon him it cannot be too
strongli impress that there ar veri few point in a hill countri at
all adapt for a perman resid there is a kind of instinct
inde by which men becom awar of thi and shrink from the sterner
featur of hill sceneri into the part possess a human interest and
thu we find the north side of the lake leman from vevai to geneva
which is about as monoton a bit of vinecountri as ani in europ
stud with villa while the south side which is as exquisit a piec
of sceneri as is to be found in all switzerland possess we think
two the instinct in thi case is true but we frequent find it in
error thu the lake of como is the resort of half itali while the
lago maggior possess scarc on villa of import besid those
on the borromean island yet the lago maggior is far better adapt
for produc and sustain a pleasur impress than that of
como
216 the first thing then which the architect ha to do in hill
countri is to bring hi employ down from heroic to common sens to
teach him that although it might be veri well for a man like pliny44
whose whole spirit and life wa wrapt up in that of natur to set
himself down under the splash of a cascad 400 feet high such escapad
ar not becom in english gentlemen and that it is necessari for hi
own satisfact as well as that of other that he should keep in the
most quiet and least pretend corner of the landscap which he ha
chosen
footnot 44 thi passag seem to suggest that the villa pliniana on
como wa built by plini it wa howev the work of an antiquarian
nobleman of the renaiss and mere name after the great
naturalist who wa born perhap at como and mention an eb
spring on thi site
217 have got hi employ well under control he ha two point to
consid first where he will spoil least and secondli where he will
gain most
now he mai spoil a landscap in two wai either by destroi an
associ connect with it or a beauti inher in it with the
first barbar we have noth to do for it is on which would not be
permit on a larg scale and even if it were could not be
perpetr by ani man of the slightest educ no on have ani
pretens to be call a human be would build himself a hous on
the meadow of the rtli or by the farm of la hay saint or on the
lone isl on loch katrin of the injustic of the second barbar we
have spoken alreadi and it is the object of thi paper to show how it
mai be avoid as well as to develop the principl by which we mai be
guid in the second question that of ascertain how much perman
pleasur will be receiv from the contempl of a given scene
218 it is veri fortun that the result of these sever
investig will gener be found the same the resid which in
the end is found altogeth delight will be found to have been
place where it ha commit no injuri and therefor the best wai of
consult our own conveni in the end is to consult the feel
of the spectat in the beginning45 now the first grand rule for the
choic of situat is never to build a villa where the ground is not
richli product it is not enough that it should be capabl of
produc a crop of scanti oat or turnip in a fine season it must be
rich and luxuri and glow with veget power of on kind or
another46 for the veri chiefest47 part of the charact of the
edific of pleasur is and must be it perfect eas it appear of
felicit repos thi it can never have where the natur and
express of the land near it remind us of the necess of labor and
where the earth is niggardli of all that constitut it beauti and our
pleasur thi it can onli have where the presenc of man seem the
natur consequ of an ampl provis for hi enjoy not the
continu struggl of suffer exist with a rude heaven and rug
soil there is nobil in such a struggl but not when it is
maintain by the inhabit of the villa in whom it is unnatur and
therefor injuri in it effect the narrow cottag on the desol
moor or the stalwart hospic on the crest of the alp each leav an
ennobl impress of energi and endur but the possessor of the
villa should call not upon our admir but upon our sympathi and
hi function is to deepen the impress of the beauti and the full
of creation not to exhibit the majesti of man to show in the
intercours of earth and her children not how her sever mai be
mock by their heroism but how her bounti mai be honor in their
enjoy
footnot 45 for instanc on proprietor terrifi the landscap all
round him within a rang of three mile by the conspicu posit of
hi habit and is punish by find that from whatev quarter
the wind mai blow it send in some of hi plateglass anoth spoil a
pretti bit of crag by build below it and ha two or three ton of
stone drop through hi roof the first frosti night anoth occupi
the turfi slope of some soft lake promontori and ha hi cook wash
awai by the first flood we do not rememb ever have seen a
dwellinghous destroi the effect of a landscap of which
consid mere as a habit we should wish to be the possessor
footnot 46 we ar not think of the effect upon the human frame of
the air which is favor to veget chemic consid the
brace breez of the more steril soil is the most conduc to health
and is practic so when the frame is not perpetu expos to it
but the keen which check the growth of the plant is in all
probabl try to sai the least to the constitut of a
resid
footnot 47 we hope the english languag mai long retain thi corrupt
but energet superl
219 thi posit be onc grant will save us a great deal of
troubl for it will put out of our wai as total unfit for villa
resid ninetenth of all mountain sceneri begin with such
bleak and stormi bit of hillsid as that which wa metamorphos into
someth like a forest by the author of waverlei lai an equal
veto on all the sever landscap of such district of minor mountain
as the scotch highland and north wale and finish by set asid
all the higher sublim of alp and apennin what then ha it left
us the gentl slope of the lake shore and the spread part of the
quiet vallei in almost all sceneri and the shore of the cumberland
lake in our own distinguish as thei ar by a rich of soil
which though gener manifest onli in an exquisit soft of
pastur and round of undul is suffici evid to place
them out of the sweep rang of thi veto
220 now as we have onli to do with britain at present we shall direct
particular attent to the cumberland lake as thei ar the onli
mountain district which taken gener is adapt for the villa
resid and as everi piec of sceneri which in other district is so
adapt resembl them in charact and tone
we notic in speak of the westmoreland cottag the feel of
humil with which we ar impress dure a mountain rambl now it
is nearli imposs for a villa of larg size howev place not to
disturb and interrupt thi necessari and beauti impress
particularli where the sceneri is on a veri small scale thi
disadvantag mai be obviat in some degre as we shall see by
simplic of architectur but anoth depend on a question of
proport is inevit
221 when an object in which magnitud is a desir attribut leav
an impress on a practic ey of less magnitud than it realli
possess we should place object besid it of whose magnitud we can
satisfi ourselv of larger size than that which we ar accustom to
for by find these larg object in precis the proport to the
grand object to which we ar accustom while we know their actual
size to be on to which we ar not accustom we becom awar of the
true magnitud of the princip featur but where the object leav a
true impress of it size on the practic ey we shall do harm by
render minor object either larger or smaller than thei usual ar
where the object leav an impress of greater magnitud than it
realli possess we must render the minor object smaller than thei
usual ar to prevent our be undeceiv
222 now a mountain of 15000 feet high alwai look lower than it
realli is therefor the larger the build near it ar render the
better thu in speak of the swiss cottag it wa observ that a
build of the size of st peter in it place would exhibit the size
of the mountain more truli and strikingli a mountain 7000 feet high
strike it impress with great truth we ar deceiv on neither
side therefor the build near it should be of the averag size and
thu the villa of the lago di como be among hill from 6000 to 8000
feet high ar well proport be neither coloss nor diminut
but a mountain 3000 feet high alwai look higher than it realli
is48 therefor the build near it should be smaller than the
averag and thi is what is meant by the proport of object name
render them of such rel size as shall produc the greatest
possibl impress of those attribut which ar most desir in
both it is not the true but the desir impress which is to be
convei and it must not be in on but in both the build must not
be overwhelm by the mass of the mountain nor the precipic mock by
the elev of the cottag proport of color is a question of
quit a differ natur depend mere on admixtur and
combin
footnot 48 thi posit as well as the two preced is import
and in need of confirm it ha often been observ that when the
ey is altogeth unpract in estim elev it believ everi
point to be lower than it realli is but thi doe not milit against
the proposit for it is also well known that the higher the point
the greater the decept but when the ey is thoroughli practic in
mountain measur although the judgment argu from technic
knowledg give a true result the impress on the feel is alwai
at varianc with it except in hill of the middl height we ar
perpetu astonish in our own countri by the sublim impress
left by such hill as skiddaw or cader idri or ben venu perpetu
vex in switzerland by find that set asid circumst of
form and color the abstract impress of elev is except in some
moment of peculiar effect worth a king ransom inferior to the
truth we were stand the other dai on the slope of the brevent abov
the prieur of chamouni with a companion well practic in climb
highland hill but a stranger among the alp point out a rock abov
the glacier de bosson we request an opinion of it height i
should think wa the repli i could climb it in two step but i am
too well us to hill to be taken in in that wai it is at least 40
feet the real height wa 470 feet thi decept is attribut to
sever caus independ of the clear of the medium through
which the object is seen which it would be out of place to discuss
here but the chief of which is the natur tendenc of the feel
alwai to believ object subtend the same angl to be of the same
height we sai the feel not the ey for the practic ey never
betrai it possessor though the due and correspond mental
impress is not receiv
223 for these reason build of a veri larg size ar decidedli
destruct of effect among the english lake first becaus appar
altitud ar much diminish by them and secondli becaus whatev
posit thei mai be place in instead of combin with sceneri thei
occupi and overwhelm it for all sceneri is divid into piec each of
which ha a near bit of beauti a promontori of lichen crag or a
smooth sward knoll or someth of the kind to begin with wherev
the larg villa come it take up on of these begin of landscap
altogeth and the part of crag or wood which ought to combin with
it becom subservi to it and lost in it gener effect that is
ordinarili in a gener effect of ugli thi should never be the
case howev intrins beauti the edific mai be it should
assist but not supersed join but not eclips appear but not
intrud
224 the gener rule by which we ar to determin the size is to
select the largest mass which will not overwhelm ani object of fine
form within two hundr yard of it and if it doe not do thi we mai
be quit sure it is not too larg for the distant featur for it is
on of natur most beauti adapt that she is never out of
proport with herself that is the minor detail of sceneri of the
first class bear exactli the proport to the same speci of detail in
sceneri of the second class that the larg featur of the first bear
to the larg featur of the second everi mineralogist know that the
quartz of the st gothard is as much larger in it crystal than the
quartz of snowdon as the peak of the on mountain overtop the peak of
the other and that the crystal of the and ar larger than
either49 everi artist know that the bowlder of an alpin
foreground and the leap of an alpin stream ar as much larger than
the bowlder and as much bolder than the leap of a cumberland
foreground and torrent as the jungfrau is higher than skiddaw
therefor if we take care of the near effect in ani countri we need
never be afraid of the distant
footnot 49 thi is rather a bold assert and we should be sorri to
maintain the fact as univers but the crystal of almost all the
rarer miner ar larger in the larger mountain and that altogeth
independ of the period of elev which in the case of mont
blanc is later than that of our own mendip
225 for these reason the cottag villa rather than the mansion is
to be prefer among our hill it ha been prefer in mani
instanc and in too mani with an unfortun result for the cottag
villa is precis that which afford the greatest scope for practic
absurd symmetri proport and some degre of simplic ar
usual kept in view in the larg build but in the smaller the
architect consid himself licens to try all sort of experi
and jumbl togeth piec of imit taken at random from hi
notebook as carelessli as a bad chemist mix element from which he
mai by accid obtain someth new though the chanc ar ten to on
that he obtain someth useless the chemist howev is more
innoc than the architect for the on throw hi trash out of the
window if the compound fail while the other alwai think hi conceit
too good to be lost the great on caus of all the error in thi
branch of architectur is the principl of imit at onc the most
bane and the most unintellectu yet perhap the most natur that
the human mind can encourag or act upon50 let it onc be thoroughli
root out and the cottag villa will becom a beauti and
interest element of our landscap
footnot 50 in 166 we notic the kind of error most common in
amateur design and we trace that error to it great first caus the
assumpt of the humor instead of the true charact for a guid but
we did not suffici specifi the mode in which that first caus
oper by prompt to imit by imit we do not mean
accur copi neither do we mean work under the influenc of the
feel by which we mai suppos the origin of a given model to
have been actuat but we mean the intermedi step of endeavor to
combin old materi in a novel manner true copi mai be disdain
by architect but it should not be disdain by nation for when the
feel of the time in which certain style had their origin have
pass awai ani exampl of the same style will invari be failur
unless thei be copi it is utter absurd to talk of build greek
edific now no man ever will or ever can who doe not believ in the
greek mytholog and precis by so much as he diverg from the
technic of strict copyism he will err but we ought to have piec
of greek architectur as we have reprint of the most valuabl record
and it is better to build a new parthenon than to set up the old on
let the dust and the desol of the acropoli be undisturb forev
let them be left to be the school of our moral feel not of our
mechan percept the line and rule of the pry carpent should
not come into the quiet and holi place of the earth elsewher we mai
build marbl model for the educ of the nation mind and ey but
it is useless to think of adapt the architectur of the greek to the
purpos of the frank it never ha been done and never will be we
delight inde in observ the rise of such a build as la
madelein beauti becaus accur copi us as teach the
ey of everi passerbi but we must not think of it purpos it is
wholli unadapt for christian worship and were it as bad greek as our
nation galleri it would be equal unfit
the mistak of our architect in gener is that thei fanci thei ar
speak good english by speak bad greek we wish therefor that
copi were more in vogu than it is but imit the endeavor to be
gothic or tyroles or venetian without the slightest grain of gothic
or venetian feel the futil effort to splash a build into ag or
daub it into digniti to zigzag it into sanctiti or slit it into
feroc when it shell is neither ancient nor dignifi and it
spirit neither priestli nor baronialthi is the degrad vice of the
ag foster as if man reason were but a step between the brain of
a kitten and a monkei in the mix love of despic excit and
miser mimicri
if the english have no imagin thei should not scorn to be
commonplac or rather thei should rememb that poverti cannot be
disguis by beggarli borrow that it mai be ennobl by calm
independ our nation architectur never will improv until our
popul ar gener convinc that in thi art as in all other
thei cannot seem what thei cannot be the scarlet coat or the
turneddown collar which the obsequi portraitpaint put on the
shoulder and off the neck of hi savag or insan custom never can
make the prentic look militari or the idiot poetic and the
architectur appurten of norman embrasur or verona balconi must
be equal ineffect until thei can turn shopkeep into baron and
schoolgirl into juliet let the nation mind be elev in it
charact and it will natur becom pure in it concept let it
be simpl in it desir and it will be beauti in it idea let it
be modest in feel and it will not be insol in stone for
architect and for employ there can be but on rule to be natur in
all that thei do and to look for the beauti of the materi creation as
thei would for that of the human form not in the chanc and chang
disposit of artifici decor but in the manifest of the
pure and anim spirit which keep it from the cold of the grave

226 so much for size the question of posit need not detain us long
as the principl advanc in 104 ar true gener with on
except beauti and calm the situat must alwai be butin
englandnot conspicu in itali the dwell of the descend of
those whose former life ha bestow on everi scene the greater part of
the majesti which it possess ought to have a digniti inher in it
which would be shame by shrink back from the sight of men and
majesti enough to prevent such nonretir from becom intrus
but the spirit of the english landscap is simpl and pastor and
mild devoid also of high associ for in the highland and wale
almost everi spot which ha the pride of memori is unfit for villa
resid and therefor all conspicu appear of it more
wealthi inhabit becom ostent not digniti impud not
condescens their dwell ought to be just evid and no more as
form part of the gentl anim and present prosper which is the
beauti of cultiv ground and thi partial conceal mai be
effect without ani sacrific of the prospect which the proprietor will
insist upon command from hi window and with great access to hi
perman enjoy
227 for first the onli prospect which is realli desir or
delight is that from the window of the breakfastroom thi is
rather a bold posit but it will appear evid on a littl
consider it is pleasant enough to have a pretti littl bit visibl
from the bedroom but after all it onli make gentlemen cut
themselv in shave and ladi never think of anyth beneath the
sun when thei ar dress then in the diningroom window ar
absolut useless becaus dinner is alwai uncomfort by daylight
and the weight of furnitur effect which adapt the room for the
gastronom rite render it detest as a sittingroom in the
librari peopl should have someth els to do than look out of
the window in the drawingroom the uncomfort still of the
quarter of an hour befor dinner mai inde be allevi by have
someth to convers about at the window but it is veri shame to
spoil a prospect of ani kind by look at it when we ar not ourselv
in a state of corpor comfort and mental goodhumor which nobodi can
be after the labor of the dai and befor he ha been fed but the
breakfastroom where we meet the first light of the dewi dai the first
breath of the morn air the first glanc of gentl ey to which we
descend in the veri spring and elast of mental renov and
bodili energi in the gather up of our spirit for the new dai in
the flush of our awaken from the dark and the mysteri of faint
and inact dream in the resurrect from our daili grave in the
first tremul sensat of the beauti of our be in the most
gloriou percept of the lightn of our life there inde our
expati of spirit when it meet the puls of outward sound and joi
the voic of bird and breez and billow doe demand some power of
liberti some space for it go forth into the morn some freedom
of intercours with the love and limitless energi of creatur and
creation
228 the breakfastroom must have a prospect and an extens on the
hot roll and hyson ar indiscuss except under such sweet
circumst but he must be an awkward architect who cannot afford an
open to on window without throw the whole mass of the build
open to public view particularli as in the second place the essenc
of a good window view is the break out of the distant featur in
littl wellcompos morceaux not the gener glare of a mass of on
tone have we a line of lake the silver water must glanc out here and
there among the trunk of near tree just enough to show where it
flow then break into an open swell of water just where it is widest
or where the shore is prettiest have we mountain their peak must
appear over foliag or through it the highest and boldest catch the
ey conspicu yet not seen from base to summit as if we want to
measur them such a prospect as thi is alwai compat with as much
conceal as we choos in all these piec of manag the
architect chief enemi is the vaniti of hi employ who will alwai
want to see more than he ought to see and than he will have pleasur in
see without reflect how the spectat pai for hi peep
229 so much then for posit we have now onli to settl the
question of form and color and we shall then have close the most
tiresom investig which we shall be call upon to enter into
inasmuch as the principl which we mai arriv at in consid the
architectur of defense51 though we hope thei mai be us in the
abstract will demand no applic to nativ landscap in which
happili no defens is now requir and those relat to sacr
edific will we also hope be suscept of more interest than can
possibl be excit by the most degrad branch of the whole art of
architectur on hardli worthi of be includ under the namethat
name with which we have late been occupi whose ostens object
is the mere provis of shelter and comfort for the despic shell
within whose dark and corrupt that puriti of percept to which
all high art is address is dure it immatur confin
footnot 51 refer again to the intend sequel
230 there ar two mode in which ani mental or materi effect mai be
increasedbi contrast or by assimil suppos that we have a
certain number of featur or exist under a given influenc then
by subject anoth featur to the same influenc we increas the
univers and therefor the effect of that influenc but by
introduc anoth featur not under the same influenc we render
the subject of the other featur more palpabl and therefor more
effect for exampl let the influenc be on of shade to which a
certain number of object ar subject we add anoth featur
subject to the same influenc and we increas the gener
impress of shade we add the same featur not subject to thi
influenc and we have deepen the effect of shade
now the principl by which we ar to be guid in the select of on
or other of these mean ar of great import and must be develop
befor we can conclud the investig of villa architectur
231 the impress produc by a given effect or influenc depend upon
it degre and it durat degre alwai mean the proportion
energi exert durat is either into time or into space or into
both the durat of color is in space alon form what is commonli
call extent the durat of sound is in space and time the space
be in the size of the wave of air which give depth to the tone the
durat of mental emot is in time alon now in all influenc as
is the degre so is the impress as is the durat so is the
effect of the impress that is it perman oper upon the
feel or the violenc with which it take possess of our own
faculti and sens as oppos to the abstract impress of it
exist without such oper on our own essenc
for exampl the natur tendenc of dark or shade is to induc fear
or melancholi now as the degre of the shade so is the abstract
impress of the exist of shade but as the durat of shade so
is the fear or melancholi excit by it
consequ when we wish to increas the abstract impress of the
power of ani influenc over object with which we have no connect we
must increas degre but when we wish the impress to produc a
perman effect upon ourselv we must increas durat
now degre is alwai increas by contrast and durat by
assimil a few instanc of thi will be suffici
232 blue is call a cold color becaus it induc a feel of
cool to the ey and is much us by natur in her cold effect
suppos that we have paint a storm scene in desol countri with
a singl miser cottag somewher in front that we have made the
atmospher and the distanc cold and blue and wish to heighten the
comfortless impress
there is an old rag hang out of the window shall it be red or blue
if it be red the piec of warm color will contrast strongli with the
atmospher will render it blueness and chilli immens more
appar will increas the degre of both and therefor the
abstract impress of the exist of cold but if it be blue it
will bring the ici of the distanc up into the foreground will fill
the whole visibl space with comfortless cold will take awai everi
relief from the desol will increas the durat of the
influenc and consequ will extend it oper into the mind
and feel of the spectat who will shiver as he look
now if we ar make a pictur we shall not hesit a moment in
goe the red for the artist while he wish to render the actual
impress of the presenc of cold in the landscap as strong as
possibl doe not wish that chilli to pass over into or affect
the spectat but endeavor to make the combin of color as
delight to hi ey and feel as possible52 but if we ar
paint a scene for theatric represent where decept is
aim at we shall be as decid in our proceed on the opposit
principl in goe the blue for we wish the idea of cold to pass over
into the spectat and make him so uncomfort as to permit hi fanci
to place him distinctli in the place we desir in the actual scene
footnot 52 thi differ of principl is on lead distinct
between the artist properli so call and the scene diorama or
panorama painter
233 again shakspear ha been blame by some few critic ass for
the railleri of mercutio and the humor of the nurs in romeo and
juliet for the fool in lear for the porter in macbeth the
gravedigg in hamlet etc becaus it is said these bit
interrupt the tragic feel no such thing thei enhanc it to an
incalcul extent thei deepen it degre though thei diminish it
durat and what is the result that the impress of the agoni of
the individu brought befor us is far stronger than it could
otherwis have been and our sympathi ar more forcibl awaken
while had the contrast been want the impress of pain would have
come over into ourselv our selfish feel instead of our sympathi
would have been awaken the concept of the grief of other
diminish and the tragedi would have made us veri uncomfort but
never have melt us to tear or excit us to indign when he
whose merri and satir laugh rung in our ear the moment befor
faint befor us with a plagu o both your hous thei have made
worm meat of me the acut of our feel is excess but had
we not heard the laugh befor there would have been a dull weight of
melancholi impress which would have been pain not affect
234 henc we see the grand import of the choic of our mean of
enhanc effect and we deriv the simpl rule for that choic name
that when we wish to increas abstract impress or to call upon the
sympathi of the spectat we ar to us contrast but when we wish to
extend the oper of the impress or to awaken the selfish
feel we ar to us assimil
thi rule howev becom complic where the featur of contrast
is not altogeth passiv that is where we wish to give a concept
of ani qualiti inher in that featur as well as in what it
reliev and besid it is not alwai easi to know whether it will be
best to increas the abstract idea or it oper in most case
energi the degre of influenc is beauti and in mani the durat
of influenc is monotoni in other durat is sublim and energi
pain in a few energi and durat ar attain and delight
togeth
235 it is imposs to give rule for judgment in everi case but the
follow point must alwai be observedfirst when we us contrast
it must be natur and like to occur thu the contrast in tragedi is
the natur consequ of the charact of human exist it is what
we see and feel everi dai of our live when a contrast is unnatur it
destroi the effect it should enhanc
can call on a french refuge in 1794 the convers natur
turn on the execut of the queen then a recent event overcom by
hi feel the parisian threw himself upon the ground exclaim in
an agoni of tear la bonn rein la pauvr rein present he
sprang up exclaim cepend monsieur il faut vou fair voir mon
petit chien danser thi contrast though natur in a parisian wa
unnatur in the natur of thing and therefor injuri
236 secondli when the gener influenc instead of be extern is
an attribut or energi of the thing itself so as to bestow on it a
perman charact the contrast which is obtain by the absenc of
that charact is injuri and becom what is call an interrupt
of the uniti thu the raw and colorless tone of the swiss cottag
notic in 42 is an injuri contrast to the rich of the
landscap which is an inher and necessari energi in surround
object so the charact of italian landscap is curvilinear
therefor the outlin of the build enter into it composit
must be arrang on curvilinear principl as investig in 144
237 thirdli but if the pervad charact can be obtain in the
singl object by differ mean the contrast will be delight thu
the elev of charact which the hill district of itali possess by
the magnific of their form is transmit to the villa by it
digniti of detail and simplic of outlin and the rectangular
interrupt to the curv of picturesqu blue countri partak of the
natur of that which it interrupt is a contrast give relief and
interest while ani elizabethan acut angl on the contrari would
have been a contrast obtain by the absenc of the pervad energi of
the univers curvilinear charact and therefor improp
238 fourthli when the gener energi instead of pervad
simultan the multitud of object as with on spirit is
independ possess and manifest by everi individu object the
result is repetit not uniti and contrast is not mere agreeabl
but necessari thu a number of object form the line of beauti is
pervad by on simpl energi but if that energi is separ
manifest in each the result is pain monotoni parallel right
line without group ar alwai liabl to thi object and
therefor a distant view of a flat countri is never beauti unless
it horizont ar lost in rich of veget as in lombardi or
broken with mass of forest or with distant hill if none of these
interrupt take place there is immedi monotoni and no
introduct can be more delight than such a tower in the distanc as
strasburg or inde than ani architectur combin of vertic
peterborough is a beauti instanc of such an adapt it is
alwai then to be rememb that repetit is not assimil
239 fifthli when ani attribut is necessarili beauti that is
beauti in everi place and circumst we need hardli sai that the
contrast consist in it absenc is pain it is onli when beauti is
local or accident that opposit mai be emploi
sixthli the edg of all contrast so to speak should be as soft as
is consist with decis effect we mean that a gradual chang is
better than instantan transfigur for though alwai less
effect it is more agreeabl but thi must be left veri much to the
judgment
seventhli we must be veri care in ascertain whether ani given
contrast is obtain by freedom from extern or absenc of intern
energi for it is often a difficult point to decid thu the peac of
the alpin vallei might at first seem to be a contrast caus by the
want of the charact of strength and sublim manifest in the hill
but it is realli caus by the freedom from the gener and extern
influenc of violenc and desol
240 these then ar principl applic to all art without a
singl except and of particular import in paint and
architecture53 it will sometim be found that on rule come in the
wai of anoth in which case the most import is of cours to be
obei but in gener thei will afford us an easi mean of arriv
at certain result when befor our conjectur must have been vagu
and unsatisfactori
footnot 53 for further discuss of which see element of
draw letter iii
we mai now proce to determin the most proper form for the mountain
villa of england
241 we must first observ the prevail line of the near hill if
thei ar vertic there will most assuredli be monotoni for the
vertic line of crag ar never group and accordingli by our fourth
rule the prevail line of our edific must be horizont on the
lake of thun the tendenc of the hill is vertic thi tendenc is
repeat by the buildings54 and the composit becom thoroughli
bad but on the lake of como we have the same vertic tendenc in the
hill while the grand line of the build ar horizont and the
composit is good but if the prevail line of the near hill be
curv and thei will be either curv or vertic we must not
interrupt their charact for the energi is then pervad not
individu and therefor our edific must be rectangular
footnot 54 in their turret and pinnacl as shown by a poor
woodcut in the magazin not worth reproduct
in both case therefor the grand outlin of the villa is the same
but in on we have it set off by contrast in the other by assimil
and we must work out in the architectur of each edific the principl
on which we have begun commenc with that in which we ar to work by
contrast the vertic crag must be the result of violenc and the
influenc of destruct of distort of tortur to speak strongli
must be evid in their everi line we free the build from thi
influenc and give it repos grace and eas and we have a
contrast of feel as well as of line by which the desir
attribut ar render evid in both object while the durat of
neither energi be allow there can be no disagre effect upon
the spectat who will not shrink from the terror of the crag nor
feel a want of excit in the gentl of the build
242 secondli solitud is power and evid in it effect on the
distant hill therefor the effect of the villa should be joyou and
lifelik not flippant howev but seren and by render it so
we shall enhanc the sublim of the distanc as we show in speak
of the westmoreland cottag and therefor we mai introduc a number
of window with good effect provid that thei ar kept in horizont
line and do not disturb the repos which we have shown to be
necessari
these three point of contrast will be quit enough there is no other
extern influenc from which we can free the build and the
pervad energi must be commun to it or it will not harmon
with our feel therefor befor proceed we had better determin
how thi contrast is to be carri out in detail
243 our line ar to be horizont then the roof must be as flat as
possibl we need not think of snow becaus howev much we mai slope
the roof it will not slip off from the materi which here is the
onli proper on and the roof of the cottag is alwai veri flat which
it would not be if there were ani inconveni attend such a form
but for the sake of the second contrast we ar to have grace
and eas as well as horizont then we must break the line of the
roof into differ elev yet not make the differ great or
we shall have visibl vertic and thi must not be done at random
illustr fig 14 lead line of villacomposit
244 take a flat line of beauti a d fig 14 for the length of the
edific strike a b horizont from a c d from d let fall
the vertic make c f equal m n the maximum and draw h f the
curv should be so far continu as that h f shall be to c d as c
d to a b then we ar sure of a beautifulli proport form much
varieti mai be introduc by us differ curv join parabola
with cycloid etc but the us of curv is alwai the best mode of
obtain good forms55
footnot 55 compar modern painter vol iv chap xvii 49 and
element of draw letter iii
further eas mai be obtain by ad combin for instanc strike
anoth curv a q b through the flat line a b bisect the maximum
v p draw the horizont r s observ to make the largest maximum
of thi curv toward the smallest maximum of the great curv to
restor the balanc join r q s b and we have anoth
modif of the same beauti form thi mai be done in either side
of the build but not in both
245 then if the flat roof be still found monoton it mai be
interrupt by garret window which must not be gabl but turn with
the curv a b whatev that mai be thi will give instant humil
to the build and take awai ani vestig of italian charact which
might hang about it and which would be wholli out of place
the window mai have toler broad architrav but no cornic an
ornament both haughti and classic in it effect and on both
account improp here thei should be in level line but group at
unequ distanc or thei will have a formal and artifici air
unsuit to the irregular and freedom around them some few of them
mai be arch howev with the curv a b the mingl of the curv
and the squar be veri grace there should not be more than two
tier and the garret or the build will be too high
so much for the gener outlin of the villa in which we ar to work by
contrast let us pass over to that in which we ar to work by
assimil befor speak of the materi and color which should be
common to both
246 the grand outlin must be design on exactli the same principl
for the curvilinear proport which were opposit befor will now
be assimil of cours we do not mean to sai that everi villa in a
hill countri should have the form a b c d we should be tire to death
if thei had but we bring forward that form as an exampl of the
agreeabl result of the principl on which we should alwai work but
whose result should be the same in no two case a modif of that
form howev will frequent be found us for under the
depress h f we mai have a hall of entranc and of exercis which
is a requisit of extrem import in hill district where it rain
three hour out of four all the year round and under c d we mai have
the kitchen servant room and coachhous leav the larg divis
quiet and comfort
247 then as in the curv countri there is no such distort as that
befor notic no such evid of violent agenc we need not be so
care about the appear of perfect peac we mai be a littl more
dignifi and a littl more classic the window mai be symmetr
arrang and if there be a blue and undul distanc the upper
tier mai even have cornic narrow architrav ar to be us the
garret mai be taken from the roof and their inmat mai be
accommod in the other side of the hous but we must take care in
do thi not to becom greek the materi as we shall see
present will assist us in keep unclass and not a vestig of
column or capit must appear in ani part of the edific all should be
pure but all should be english and there should be here as elsewher
much of the utilitarian about the whole suit to the cultiv
countri in which it is place
248 it will never do to be specul or imagin in our detail
on the supposit that the tendenc of fine sceneri is to make
everybodi imagin and enthusiast enthusiasm ha no busi with
turkei carpet or easychair and the veri prepar of comfort for
the bodi which the exist of the villa suppos is inconsist
with the supposit of ani excit of mind and thi is anoth
reason for keep the domest build in richli product countri
natur ha set asid her sublim bit for us to feel and think in she
ha point out her product bit for us to sleep and eat in and if
we sleep and eat amongst the sublim we ar brutal if we poetiz
amongst the cultiv we ar absurd there ar the time and place for
each state of exist and we should not jumbl that which natur ha
separ she ha address herself in on part wholli to the mind
there is noth for us to eat but bilberri noth to rest upon but
rock and we have no busi to concoct picnic and bring chees and
al and sandwich in basket to gratifi our beastli natur where
natur never intend us to eat if she had we neednt have brought the
basket in the other part she ha provid for our necess and
we ar veri absurd if we make ourselv fantast instead of
comfort therefor all that we ought to do in the hill villa is to
adapt it for the habit of a man of the highest faculti of
percept and feel but onli for the habit of hi hour of
common sens not of enthusiasm it must be hi dwell as a man not
as a spirit as a thing liabl to decai not as an etern energi as a
perish not as an immort
249 keep then in view these distinct of form between the two
villa the remain consider relat equal to both we have
sever time allud to the extrem rich and varieti of hill
foreground as an intern energi to which there must be no contrast
raw of color is to be especi avoid but so also is poverti
of effect it will therefor add much to the beauti of the build
if in ani conspicu and harsh angl or shadowi mold we introduc
a wreath of carv leafworkin stone of cours thi sound startl
and expens but we ar not think of expens what ought to be not
what can be afford is the question besid when all expens in
sham castl build pinnacl and all other fantastic ha
been shown to be injuri that which otherwis would have been wast
in plaster battlement to do harm mai sure be devot to stone
leafag to do good now if there be too much or too conspicu
ornament it will destroi simplic and humil and everyth which
we have been endeavor to get therefor the architect must be
care and had better have immedi recours to that natur beauti
with which he is now endeavor to assimil
250 when natur determin on decor a piec of project rock
she begin with the bold project surfac to which the ey is
natur drawn by it form and observ how close she work by the
principl which were befor investig she finish thi with
lichen and mingl color to a degre of delicaci which make us feel
that we never can look close enough but she put in not a singl mass
of form to attract the ey more than the grand outlin render
necessari but where the rock join the ground where the shadow fall
and the ey is not attract she put in bold form of ornament larg
leav and grass bunch of moss and heather strong in their
project and deep in their color therefor the architect must act
on precis the same principl hi outward surfac he mai leav the
wind and weather to finish in their own wai but he cannot allow natur
to put grass and weed into the shadow ergo he must do it himself
and whenev the ey lose itself in shade wherev there is a dark
and sharp corner there if he can he should introduc a wreath of
flowerwork the carv will be preserv from the weather by thi veri
proprieti of situat it would have molder awai had it been expos
to the full drift of the rain but will remain safe in the crevic
where it is requir and also it will not injur the gener effect
but will lie conceal until we approach and then rise up as it were
out of the dark to it duti bestow on the dwell that finish
of effect which is manifest around them and gratifi the natur
requir of the mind for the same rich in the execut of the
design of men which it ha found on a near approach lavish so
abundantli in a distant view subdu so beautifulli into the larg
effect of the design of natur
251 of the ornament itself it is to be observ that it is not to be
what is properli call architectur decor that which is
decor becom or suitabl to name the combin of minor
form which repeat the line and partak of the essenc of the grand
design and carri out it mean and life into it everi member but it
is to be true sculptur the present of a pure ideal of form to
the ey which mai give perfect concept without the assist of
color it is to be the stone imag of veget not botan
accur inde but suffici near to permit us to be sure of the
intend flower or leaf not a singl line of ani other kind of ornament
should be admit and there should be more leafag than flowerwork
as it is the more easi in it flow and outlin deep relief need not be
attempt but the edg of the leafag should be clearli and delic
defin the cabbag the vine and the ivi ar the best and most
beauti leav oak is a littl too stiff otherwis good particular
attent ought to be paid to the eas of the stem and tendril such
care will alwai be repaid and it is to be especi observ that
the carv is not to be arrang in garland or knot or ani other
formal as in gothic work but the stalk ar to rise out of the
stone as if thei were root in it and to fling themselv down where
thei ar want disappear again in light sprai as if thei were
still grow
252 all thi will requir care in design but as we have said
befor we can alwai do without decor but if we have it it
must be well done it is not of the slightest us to econom everi
farth improperli save doe a shill worth of damag and that is
get a bargain the wrong wai when on branch or group balanc
anoth thei must be differ in composit the same group mai be
introduc sever time in differ part but not when there is
correspond or the effect will be unnatur and it can hardli be
too often repeat that the ornament must be kept out of the gener
effect must be invis to all but the near observ and even to
him must not becom a necessari part of the design but must be
sparingli and cautious appli so as to appear to have been thrown in
by chanc here and there as natur would have thrown in a bunch of
herbag afford adorn without conceal and relief without
interrupt
253 so much for form the question of color ha alreadi been discuss
at some length in speak of the cottag but it is to be notic
that the villa from the natur of it situat get the higher hill
back into a distanc which is three or four time more blue than ani
piec of sceneri enter into combin with the cottag so that
more warmth of color is allow in the build as well as greater
cheer of effect it should not look like stone as the cottag
should but should tell as a build on the mind as well as the ey
white therefor is frequent allow in small quantiti
particularli on the border of a larg and softli shore lake like
windermer and the foot of loch lomond but creamcolor and
puttycolor and the other varieti of plastercolor ar inexcus
if more warmth is requir by the situat than the sun will give on
white the build should be darken at onc a warm rich grai is
alwai beauti in ani place and under ani circumst and in fact
unless the proprietor like to be kept damp like a travel codfish by
tree about hi hous and close to it which if it be white he must
have to prevent glare such a grai is the onli color which will be
beauti or even innoc the difficulti is to obtain it and thi
natur lead to the question of materi
254 if the color is to be white we can have no ornament for the
shadow would make it far too conspicu and we should get onli
tawdri the simpl form mai be execut in anyth that will stand
wet and the roof in all case should be of the coars slate of the
countri as rude put on as possibl thei must be kept clear of moss
and conspicu veget or there will be an improp appear of
decai but the more lichen the better and the rougher the slate the
sooner it is color if the color is to be grai we mai us the grai
primit limeston which is not rag on the edg without prepar
the block too smoothli or the more compact and palecolor slate
which is frequent done in westmoreland and execut the ornament in
ani veri coars dark marbl greenston is an excel rock and ha a
fine surfac but it is unmanag the grayer granit mai often be
us with good effect as well as the coars porphyri when the grai
is to be particularli warm an outward surfac of a loos block mai be
often turn to good account in turn an angl as the color which it
ha contract by it natur exposur will remain on it without
induc damp it is alwai to be rememb that he who prefer
neat to beauti and who would have sharp angl and clean surfac
in prefer to curv outlin and lichen color ha no busi to
live among hill
255 such then ar the princip point to be kept in view in the
edific itself of the mode of unit it with the near featur of
foliag and ground it would be utterli useless to speak it is a
question of infinit varieti and involv the whole theori of
composit so that it would take up volum to develop principl
suffici to guid us to the result which the feel of the practic
ey would arriv at in a moment the inequ of the ground the
charact and color of those inequ the natur of the air the
exposur and the consequ fall of the light the quantiti and form of
near and distant foliag all have their effect on the design and
should have their influenc on the design induc as thei do a
perfect chang of circumst in everi local onli on gener rule
can be given and that we repeat the hous must not be a noun
substant it must not stand by itself it must be part and parcel of
a proport whole it must not even be seen all at onc and he who
see on end should feel that from the given data he can arriv at no
conclus respect the other yet be impress with a feel of a
univers energi pervad with it beauti of unanim all life and
all inanim all form of still or motion all presenc of
silenc or of sound
256 thu then we have review the most interest exampl of
exist villa architectur and we have appli the principl deriv
from those exampl to the landscap of our own countri throughout we
have endeavor to direct attent to the spirit rather than to the
letter of all law and to exhibit the beauti of that principl which is
embodi in the line with which we have head thi conclud paper of
be satisfi with nation and natur form and not endeavor to
introduc the imagin or imit the custom of foreign nation
or of former time all imit ha it origin in vaniti and vaniti
is the bane of architectur and as we take leav of them we would
onc for all remind our english son of semproniu qui villa
attollunt marmor nova nova in the full sens of the wordand
who ar set all english feel and all natur principl at
defianc that it is onli the bourgeoi gentilhomm who will wear hi
