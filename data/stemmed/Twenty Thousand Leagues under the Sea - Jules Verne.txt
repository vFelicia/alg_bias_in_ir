a shift reef
the year 1866 wa signalis by a remark incid a mysteri and
puzzl phenomenon which doubtless no on ha yet forgotten not to
mention rumour which agit the maritim popul and excit the
public mind even in the interior of contin seafar men were
particularli excit merchant common sailor captain of vessel
skipper both of europ and america naval offic of all countri
and the govern of sever state on the two contin were
deepli interest in the matter
for some time past vessel had been met by an enorm thing a long
object spindleshap occasion phosphoresc and infinit
larger and more rapid in it movement than a whale
the fact relat to thi apparit enter in variou logbook
agre in most respect as to the shape of the object or creatur in
question the untir rapid of it movement it surpris power
of locomot and the peculiar life with which it seem endow if
it wa a cetacean it surpass in size all those hitherto classifi
in scienc take into consider the mean of observ made at
diver timesreject the timid estim of those who assign to
thi object a length of two hundr feet equal with the exagger
opinion which set it down as a mile in width and three in lengthw
might fairli conclud that thi mysteri be surpass greatli all
dimens admit by the ichthyologist of the dai if it exist at
all and that it did exist wa an undeni fact and with that
tendenc which dispos the human mind in favour of the marvel we
can understand the excit produc in the entir world by thi
supernatur apparit as to class it in the list of fabl the
idea wa out of the question
on the 20th of juli 1866 the steamer governor higginson of the
calcutta and burnach steam navig compani had met thi move mass
five mile off the east coast of australia captain baker thought at
first that he wa in the presenc of an unknown sandbank he even
prepar to determin it exact posit when two column of water
project by the inexplic object shot with a hiss nois a
hundr and fifti feet up into the air now unless the sandbank had
been submit to the intermitt erupt of a geyser the governor
higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquat mammal
unknown till then which threw up from it blowhol column of water
mix with air and vapour
similar fact were observ on the 23rd of juli in the same year in
the pacif ocean by the columbu of the west india and pacif
steam navig compani but thi extraordinari cetac creatur
could transport itself from on place to anoth with surpris
veloc as in an interv of three dai the governor higginson
and the columbu had observ it at two differ point of the
chart separ by a distanc of more than seven hundr nautic
leagu
fifteen dai later two thousand mile farther off the helvetia of
the compagnienational and the shannon of the royal mail steamship
compani sail to windward in that portion of the atlant ly
between the unit state and europ respect signal the
monster to each other in 42 15 n lat and 60 35 w long in these
simultan observ thei thought themselv justifi in
estim the minimum length of the mammal at more than three hundr
and fifti feet as the shannon and helvetia were of smaller
dimens than it though thei measur three hundr feet over all
now the largest whale those which frequent those part of the sea
round the aleutian kulammak and umgullich island have never
exceed the length of sixti yard if thei attain that
these report arriv on after the other with fresh observ
made on board the transatlant ship pereir a collis which
occur between the etna of the inman line and the monster a
proc verbal direct by the offic of the french frigat
normandi a veri accur survei made by the staff of commodor
fitzjam on board the lord clyde greatli influenc public
opinion lightthink peopl jest upon the phenomenon but grave
practic countri such as england america and germani treat the
matter more serious
in everi place of great resort the monster wa the fashion thei sang
of it in the caf ridicul it in the paper and repres it on
the stage all kind of stori were circul regard it there
appear in the paper caricatur of everi gigant and imaginari
creatur from the white whale the terribl mobi dick of hyperborean
region to the immens kraken whose tentacl could entangl a ship of
five hundr ton and hurri it into the abyss of the ocean the
legend of ancient time were even resuscit and the opinion of
aristotl and plini reviv who admit the exist of these
monster as well as the norwegian tale of bishop pontoppidan the
account of paul hegged and last of all the report of mr
harrington whose good faith no on could suspect who affirm that
be on board the castillan in 1857 he had seen thi enorm
serpent which had never until that time frequent ani other sea but
those of the ancient constitutionnel
then burst forth the intermin controversi between the credul and
the incredul in the societi of savant and the scientif
journal the question of the monster inflam all mind editor of
scientif journal quarrel with believ in the supernatur

sailor at length an articl in a wellknown satir journal by a
favourit contributor the chief of the staff settl the monster
like hippolytu give it the deathblow amidst an univers burst of
laughter wit had conquer scienc
dure the first month of the year 1867 the question seem buri
never to reviv when new fact were brought befor the public it wa
then no longer a scientif problem to be solv but a real danger
serious to be avoid the question took quit anoth shape the
monster becam a small island a rock a reef but a reef of indefinit
and shift proport
on the 5th of march 1867 the moravian of the montreal ocean
compani find herself dure the night in 27 30 lat and 72 15
long struck on her starboard quarter a rock mark in no chart for
that part of the sea under the combin effort of the wind and it
four hundr horsepow it wa go at the rate of thirteen knot
had it not been for the superior strength of the hull of the
moravian she would have been broken by the shock and gone down with
the 237 passeng she wa bring home from canada
the accid happen about five oclock in the morn as the dai wa
break the offic of the quarterdeck hurri to the afterpart of
the vessel thei examin the sea with the most scrupul attent
thei saw noth but a strong eddi about three cabl length distant
as if the surfac had been violent agit the bear of the
place were taken exactli and the moravian continu it rout
without appar damag had it struck on a submerg rock or on an
enorm wreck thei could not tell but on examin of the ship
bottom when undergo repair it wa found that part of her keel wa
broken
thi fact so grave in itself might perhap have been forgotten like
mani other if three week after it had not been reenact under
similar circumst but thank to the nation of the victim of
the shock thank to the reput of the compani to which the vessel
belong the circumst becam extens circul
the 13th of april 1867 the sea be beauti the breez
favour the scotia of the cunard compani line found herself
in 15 12 long and 45 37 lat she wa go at the speed of
thirteen knot and a half
at seventeen minut past four in the afternoon whilst the passeng
were assembl at lunch in the great saloon a slight shock wa felt on
the hull of the scotia on her quarter a littl aft of the
portpaddl
the scotia had not struck but she had been struck and seemingli by
someth rather sharp and penetr than blunt the shock had been
so slight that no on had been alarm had it not been for the shout
of the carpent watch who rush on to the bridg exclaim we
ar sink we ar sink at first the passeng were much
frighten but captain anderson hasten to reassur them the danger
could not be immin the scotia divid into seven compart by
strong partit could brave with impun ani leak captain anderson
went down immedi into the hold he found that the sea wa pour
into the fifth compart and the rapid of the influx prove that
the forc of the water wa consider fortun thi compart
did not hold the boiler or the fire would have been immedi
extinguish captain anderson order the engin to be stop at
onc and on of the men went down to ascertain the extent of the
injuri some minut afterward thei discov the exist of a
larg hole of two yard in diamet in the ship bottom such a leak
could not be stop and the scotia her paddl half submerg wa
oblig to continu her cours she wa then three hundr mile from
cape clear and after three dai delai which caus great uneasi
in liverpool she enter the basin of the compani
the engin visit the scotia which wa put in dry dock thei
could scarc believ it possibl at two yard and a half below
watermark wa a regular rent in the form of an isoscel triangl
the broken place in the iron plate wa so perfectli defin that it
could not have been more neatli done by a punch it wa clear then
that the instrument produc the perfor wa not of a common
stamp and after have been driven with prodigi strength and
pierc an iron plate 138 inch thick had withdrawn itself by a
retrograd motion truli inexplic
such wa the last fact which result in excit onc more the
torrent of public opinion from thi moment all unlucki casualti
which could not be otherwis account for were put down to the
monster upon thi imaginari creatur rest the respons of all
these shipwreck which unfortun were consider for of three
thousand ship whose loss wa annual record at lloyd the number
of sail and steam ship suppos to be total lost from the
absenc of all new amount to not less than two hundr
now it wa the monster who justli or unjustli wa accus of their
disappear and thank to it commun between the differ
contin becam more and more danger the public demand
peremptorili that the sea should at ani price be reliev from thi
formid cetacean
chapter ii
pro and con
at the period when these event took place i had just return from a
scientif research in the disagre territori of nebraska in the
unit state in virtu of my offic as assist professor in the
museum of natur histori in pari the french govern had attach
me to that expedit after six month in nebraska i arriv in new
york toward the end of march laden with a preciou collect my
departur for franc wa fix for the first dai in mai meanwhil i
wa occupi myself in classifi my mineralog botan and
zoolog rich when the accid happen to the scotia
i wa perfectli up in the subject which wa the question of the dai
how could i be otherwis i had read and reread all the american and
european paper without be ani nearer a conclus thi mysteri
puzzl me under the imposs of form an opinion i jump
from on extrem to the other that there realli wa someth could
not be doubt and the incredul were invit to put their finger on
the wound of the scotia
on my arriv at new york the question wa at it height the
hypothesi of the float island and the unapproach sandbank
support by mind littl compet to form a judgment wa abandon
and inde unless thi shoal had a machin in it stomach how could
it chang it posit with such astonish rapid
from the same caus the idea of a float hull of an enorm wreck
wa given up
there remain then onli two possibl solut of the question which
creat two distinct parti on on side those who were for a monster
of coloss strength on the other those who were for a submarin
vessel of enorm motiv power
but thi last hypothesi plausibl as it wa could not stand against
inquiri made in both world that a privat gentleman should have
such a machin at hi command wa not like where when and how wa
it built and how could it construct have been kept secret
certainli a govern might possess such a destruct machin and in
these disastr time when the ingenu of man ha multipli the
power of weapon of war it wa possibl that without the knowledg of
other a state might try to work such a formid engin after the
chassepot came the torpedo after the torpedo the submarin ram
thenth reaction at least i hope so
but the hypothesi of a war machin fell befor the declar of
govern as public interest wa in question and transatlant
commun suffer their verac could not be doubt but how
admit that the construct of thi submarin boat had escap the
public ey for a privat gentleman to keep the secret under such
circumst would be veri difficult and for a state whose everi act
is persist watch by power rival certainli imposs
after inquiri made in england franc russia prussia spain itali
and america even in turkei the hypothesi of a submarin monitor wa
definit reject
upon my arriv in new york sever person did me the honour of
consult me on the phenomenon in question i had publish in franc
a work in quarto in two volum entitl mysteri of the great
submarin ground thi book highli approv of in the learn world
gain for me a special reput in thi rather obscur branch of
natur histori my advic wa ask as long as i could deni the
realiti of the fact i confin myself to a decid neg but soon
find myself driven into a corner i wa oblig to explain myself
categor and even the honour pierr aronnax professor in
the museum of pari wa call upon by the new york herald to
express a definit opinion of some sort i did someth i spoke for
want of power to hold my tongu i discuss the question in all it
form polit and scientif and i give here an extract from
a carefullystudi articl which i publish in the number of the 30th
of april it ran as follow
after examin on by on the differ hypothes reject all
other suggest it becom necessari to admit the exist of a
marin anim of enorm power
the great depth of the ocean ar entir unknown to us sound
cannot reach them what pass in those remot depthswhat be live
or can live twelv or fifteen mile beneath the surfac of the
waterswhat is the organis of these anim we can scarc
conjectur howev the solut of the problem submit to me mai
modifi the form of the dilemma either we do know all the varieti of
be which peopl our planet or we do not if we do not know them
allif natur ha still secret in ichthyolog for us noth is more
conform to reason than to admit the exist of fish or
cetacean of other kind or even of new speci of an organis
form to inhabit the strata inaccess to sound and which an
accid of some sort either fatast or caprici ha brought at
long interv to the upper level of the ocean
if on the contrari we do know all live kind we must
necessarili seek for the anim in question amongst those marin be
alreadi class and in that case i should be dispos to admit the
exist of a gigant narwhal
the common narwhal or unicorn of the sea often attain a length of
sixti feet increas it size fivefold or tenfold give it strength
proportion to it size lengthen it destruct weapon and you
obtain the anim requir it will have the proport determin by
the offic of the shannon the instrument requir by the
perfor of the scotia and the power necessari to pierc the hull
of the steamer
inde the narwhal is arm with a sort of ivori sword a halberd
accord to the express of certain naturalist the princip tusk
ha the hard of steel some of these tusk have been found buri
in the bodi of whale which the unicorn alwai attack with success
other have been drawn out not without troubl from the bottom of
ship which thei had pierc through and through as a gimlet pierc
a barrel the museum of the faculti of medicin of pari possess on
of these defens weapon two yard and a quarter in length and
fifteen inch in diamet at the base
veri well suppos thi weapon to be six time stronger and the anim
ten time more power launch it at the rate of twenti mile an hour
and you obtain a shock capabl of produc the catastroph requir
until further inform therefor i shall maintain it to be a
seaunicorn of coloss dimens arm not with a halberd but with
a real spur as the armour frigat or the ram of war whose
massiv and motiv power it would possess at the same time thu
mai thi puzzl phenomenon be explain unless there be someth
over and abov all that on ha ever conjectur seen perceiv or
experienc which is just within the bound of possibl
these last word were cowardli on my part but up to a certain point
i wish to shelter my digniti as professor and not give too much
caus for laughter to the american who laugh well when thei do laugh
i reserv for myself a wai of escap in effect howev i admit
the exist of the monster my articl wa warmli discuss which
procur it a high reput it ralli round it a certain number of
partisan the solut it propos gave at least full liberti to the
imagin the human mind delight in grand concept of
supernatur be and the sea is precis their best vehicl the
onli medium through which these giant against which terrestri
anim such as eleph or rhinoceros ar as noth can be
produc or develop
the industri and commerci paper treat the question chiefli from
thi point of view the ship and mercantil gazett the lloyd
list the packetboat and the maritim and coloni review all
paper devot to insur compani which threaten to rais their
rate of premium were unanim on thi point public opinion had been
pronounc the unit state were the first in the field and in new
york thei made prepar for an expedit destin to pursu thi
narwhal a frigat of great speed the abraham lincoln wa put in
commiss as soon as possibl the arsen were open to command
farragut who hasten the arm of hi frigat but as it alwai
happen the moment it wa decid to pursu the monster the monster
did not appear for two month no on heard it spoken of no ship met
with it it seem as if thi unicorn knew of the plot weav around
it it had been so much talk of even through the atlant cabl
that jester pretend that thi slender fly had stop a telegram on
it passag and wa make the most of it
so when the frigat had been arm for a long campaign and provid
with formid fish apparatu no on could tell what cours to
pursu impati grew apac when on the 2nd of juli thei learn
that a steamer of the line of san francisco from california to
shanghai had seen the anim three week befor in the north pacif
ocean the excit caus by thi new wa extrem the ship wa
revictual and well stock with coal
three hour befor the abraham lincoln left brooklyn pier i receiv
a letter word as follow
to m aronnax professor in the museum of pari fifth avenu hotel
new york
sirif you will consent to join the abraham lincoln in thi
expedit the govern of the unit state will with pleasur see
franc repres in the enterpris command farragut ha a cabin at
your dispos
veri cordial your

chapter iii
i form my resolut
three second befor the arriv of j b hobson letter i no more
thought of pursu the unicorn than of attempt the passag of the
north sea three second after read the letter of the honour
secretari of marin i felt that my true vocat the sole end of my
life wa to chase thi disturb monster and purg it from the
world
but i had just return from a fatigu journei weari and long for
repos i aspir to noth more than again see my countri my
friend my littl lodg by the jardin de plant my dear and
preciou collect but noth could keep me back i forgot
allfatigu friend and collectionsand accept without hesit
the offer of the american govern
besid thought i all road lead back to europ for my particular
benefit and i will not hurri me toward the coast of franc thi
worthi anim mai allow itself to be caught in the sea of europ for
my particular benefit and i will not bring back less than half a yard
of hi ivori halberd to the museum of natur histori but in the
meanwhil i must seek thi narwhal in the north pacif ocean which
to return to franc wa take the road to the antipod
conseil i call in an impati voic
conseil wa my servant a true devot flemish boi who had
accompani me in all my travel i like him and he return the
like well he wa phlegmat by natur regular from principl
zealou from habit evinc littl disturb at the differ
surpris of life veri quick with hi hand and apt at ani servic
requir of him and despit hi name never give adviceeven when
ask for it
conseil had follow me for the last ten year wherev scienc led
never onc did he complain of the length or fatigu of a journei never
make an object to pack hi portmanteau for whatev countri it might
be or howev far awai whether china or congo besid all thi he
had good health which defi all sick and solid muscl but no
nerv good moral ar understood thi boi wa thirti year old and
hi ag to that of hi master as fifteen to twenti mai i be excus
for sai that i wa forti year old
but conseil had on fault he wa ceremoni to a degre and would
never speak to me but in the third person which wa sometim
provok
conseil said i again begin with feverish hand to make
prepar for my departur
certainli i wa sure of thi devot boi as a rule i never ask him
if it were conveni for him or not to follow me in my travel but
thi time the expedit in question might be prolong and the
enterpris might be hazard in pursuit of an anim capabl of
sink a frigat as easili as a nutshel here there wa matter for
reflect even to the most impass man in the world what would
conseil sai
conseil i call a third time
conseil appear
did you call sir said he enter
ye my boi make prepar for me and yourself too we leav in

cheropotamu and the other skin
thei will keep them at the hotel
and your live babiroussa sir
thei will feed it dure our absenc besid i will give order to
forward our menageri to franc
we ar not return to pari then said conseil
oh certainli i answer evas by make a curv
will the curv pleas you sir
oh it will be noth not quit so direct a road that is all we
take our passag in the abraham lincoln
as you think proper sir coolli repli conseil
you see my friend it ha to do with the monsterth famou narwhal
we ar go to purg it from the sea the author of a work in quarto
in two volum on the mysteri of the great submarin ground
cannot forbear embark with command farragut a gloriou mission
but a danger on we cannot tell where we mai go these anim can
be veri caprici but we will go whether or no we have got a captain
who is pretti wideawak
i open a credit account for babiroussa and conseil follow i
jump into a cab our luggag wa transport to the deck of the
frigat immedi i hasten on board and ask for command
farragut on of the sailor conduct me to the poop where i found
myself in the presenc of a goodlook offic who held out hi hand
to me
monsieur pierr aronnax said he
himself repli i command farragut
you ar welcom professor your cabin is readi for you
i bow and desir to be conduct to the cabin destin for me
the abraham lincoln had been well chosen and equip for her new
destin she wa a frigat of great speed fit with
highpressur engin which admit a pressur of seven atmospher
under thi the abraham lincoln attain the mean speed of nearli
eighteen knot and a third an houra consider speed but
nevertheless insuffici to grappl with thi gigant cetacean
the interior arrang of the frigat correspond to it nautic
qualiti i wa well satisfi with my cabin which wa in the after
part open upon the gunroom
we shall be well off here said i to conseil
as well by your honour leav as a hermitcrab in the shell of a
whelk said conseil
i left conseil to stow our trunk conveni awai and remount the
poop in order to survei the prepar for departur
at that moment command farragut wa order the last moor to be
cast loos which held the abraham lincoln to the pier of brooklyn so
in a quarter of an hour perhap less the frigat would have sail
without me i should have miss thi extraordinari supernatur and
incred expedit the recit of which mai well meet with some
sceptic
but command farragut would not lose a dai nor an hour in scour the
sea in which the anim had been sight he sent for the engin
is the steam full on ask he
ye sir repli the engin
go ahead cri command farragut

captain farragut wa a good seaman worthi of the frigat he command
hi vessel and he were on he wa the soul of it on the question of
the cetacean there wa no doubt in hi mind and he would not allow the
exist of the anim to be disput on board he believ in it as
certain good women believ in the leviathanbi faith not by reason
the monster did exist and he had sworn to rid the sea of it he wa a
kind of knight of rhode a second dieudonn de gozon go to meet
the serpent which desol the island either captain farragut would
kill the narwhal or the narwhal would kill the captain there wa no
third cours
the offic on board share the opinion of their chief thei were ever
chat discuss and calcul the variou chanc of a meet
watch narrowli the vast surfac of the ocean more than on took up
hi quarter voluntarili in the crosstre who would have curs such
a berth under ani other circumst as long as the sun describ it
daili cours the rig wa crowd with sailor whose feet were
burnt to such an extent by the heat of the deck as to render it
unbear still the abraham lincoln had not yet breast the
suspect water of the pacif as to the ship compani thei desir
noth better than to meet the unicorn to harpoon it hoist it on
board and despatch it thei watch the sea with eager attent
besid captain farragut had spoken of a certain sum of two thousand
dollar set apart for whoever should first sight the monster were he
cabinboi common seaman or offic
i leav you to judg how ey were us on board the abraham lincoln
for my own part i wa not behind the other and left to no on my
share of daili observ the frigat might have been call the
argu for a hundr reason onli on amongst us conseil seem to
protest by hi indiffer against the question which so interest us
all and seem to be out of keep with the gener enthusiasm on
board
i have said that captain farragut had carefulli provid hi ship with
everi apparatu for catch the gigant cetacean no whaler had ever
been better arm we possess everi known engin from the harpoon
thrown by the hand to the barb arrow of the blunderbuss and the
explos ball of the duckgun on the forecastl lai the perfect
of a breechload gun veri thick at the breech and veri narrow in
the bore the model of which had been in the exhibit of 1867 thi
preciou weapon of american origin could throw with eas a conic

what wa better still she had on board ned land the princ of

fish and hi combat with natur poetri of express hi
recit took the form of an epic poem and i seem to be listen to
a canadian homer sing the iliad of the region of the north
i am portrai thi hardi companion as i realli knew him we ar old
friend now unit in that unchang friendship which is born and
cement amidst extrem danger ah brave ned i ask no more than to
live a hundr year longer that i mai have more time to dwell the
longer on your memori
now what wa ned land opinion upon the question of the marin
monster i must admit that he did not believ in the unicorn and wa
the onli on on board who did not share that univers convict he
even avoid the subject which i on dai thought it my duti to press
upon him on magnific even the 30th of julythat is to sai
three week after our departureth frigat wa abreast of cape blanc
thirti mile to leeward of the coast of patagonia we had cross the
tropic of capricorn and the strait of magellan open less than seven
hundr mile to the south befor eight dai were over the abraham
lincoln would be plough the water of the pacif
seat on the poop ned land and i were chat of on thing and
anoth as we look at thi mysteri sea whose great depth had up
to thi time been inaccess to the ey of man i natur led up
the convers to the giant unicorn and examin the variou chanc
of success or failur of the expedit but see that ned land let
me speak without sai too much himself i press him more close
well ned said i is it possibl that you ar not convinc of the
exist of thi cetacean that we ar follow have you ani
particular reason for be so incredul
the harpoon look at me fixedli for some moment befor answer
struck hi broad forehead with hi hand a habit of hi as if to
collect himself and said at last perhap i have mr aronnax
but ned you a whaler by profess familiaris with all the great
marin mammaliay whose imagin might easili accept the
hypothesi of enorm cetacean you ought to be the last to doubt
under such circumst
that is just what deceiv you professor repli ned that the
vulgar should believ in extraordinari comet travers space and in
the exist of antediluvian monster in the heart of the globe mai
well be but neither astronom nor geologist believ in such
chimera as a whaler i have follow mani a cetacean harpoon a
great number and kill sever but howev strong or wellarm
thei mai have been neither their tail nor their weapon would have
been abl even to scratch the iron plate of a steamer
but ned thei tell of ship which the teeth of the narwhal have
pierc through and through
wooden shipsthat is possibl repli the canadian but i have
never seen it done and until further proof i deni that whale
cetacean or seaunicorn could ever produc the effect you describ
well ned i repeat it with a convict rest on the logic of
fact i believ in the exist of a mammal power fulli organis
belong to the branch of vertebrata like the whale the cachalot
or the dolphin and furnish with a horn of defenc of great
penetr power
hum said the harpoon shake hi head with the air of a man who
would not be convinc
notic on thing my worthi canadian i resum if such an anim
is in exist if it inhabit the depth of the ocean if it
frequent the strata ly mile below the surfac of the water it
must necessarili possess an organis the strength of which would
defi all comparison
and why thi power organis demand ned
becaus it requir incalcul strength to keep on self in these
strata and resist their pressur listen to me let us admit that the
pressur of the atmospher is repres by the weight of a column of
water thirtytwo feet high in realiti the column of water would be
shorter as we ar speak of sea water the densiti of which is
greater than that of fresh water veri well when you dive ned as
mani time thirtytwo feet of water as there ar abov you so mani
time doe your bodi bear a pressur equal to that of the atmospher
that is to sai 15 lb for each squar inch of it surfac it
follow then that at 320 feet thi pressur that of 10 atmospher
of 100 atmospher at 3200 feet and of 1000 atmospher at 32000
feet that is about 6 mile which is equival to sai that if you
could attain thi depth in the ocean each squar threeeighth of an
inch of the surfac of your bodi would bear a pressur of 5600 lb ah
my brave ned do you know how mani squar inch you carri on the
surfac of your bodi
i have no idea mr aronnax
about 6500 and as in realiti the atmospher pressur is about 15
lb to the squar inch your 6500 squar inch bear at thi moment a
pressur of 97500 lb
without my perceiv it
without your perceiv it and if you ar not crush by such a
pressur it is becaus the air penetr the interior of your bodi
with equal pressur henc perfect equilibrium between the interior and
exterior pressur which thu neutralis each other and which allow
you to bear it without inconveni but in the water it is anoth
thing
ye i understand repli ned becom more attent becaus the
water surround me but doe not penetr
precis ned so that at 32 feet beneath the surfac of the sea you
would undergo a pressur of 97500 lb at 320 feet ten time that
pressur at 3200 feet a hundr time that pressur lastli at
32000 feet a thousand time that pressur would be 97500000
lbsthat is to sai that you would be flatten as if you had been
drawn from the plate of a hydraul machin
the devil exclaim ned
veri well my worthi harpoon if some vertebr sever hundr
yard long and larg in proport can maintain itself in such
depthsof those whose surfac is repres by million of squar
inch that is by ten of million of pound we must estim the
pressur thei undergo consid then what must be the resist of
their boni structur and the strength of their organis to
withstand such pressur
why exclaim ned land thei must be made of iron plate eight
inch thick like the armour frigat
as you sai ned and think what destruct such a mass would caus
if hurl with the speed of an express train against the hull of a
vessel
yescertainlyperhap repli the canadian shaken by these figur
but not yet will to give in
well have i convinc you
you have convinc me of on thing sir which is that if such
anim do exist at the bottom of the sea thei must necessarili be as
strong as you sai
but if thei do not exist mine obstin harpoon how explain the
accid to the scotia
chapter v
at a ventur
the voyag of the abraham lincoln wa for a long time mark by no
special incid but on circumst happen which show the
wonder dexter of ned land and prove what confid we might
place in him
the 30th of june the frigat spoke some american whaler from whom we
learn that thei knew noth about the narwhal but on of them the
captain of the monro know that ned land had ship on board the
abraham lincoln beg for hi help in chase a whale thei had in
sight command farragut desir of see ned land at work gave
him permiss to go on board the monro and fate serv our
canadian so well that instead of on whale he harpoon two with a
doubl blow strike on straight to the heart and catch the other
after some minut pursuit
decidedli if the monster ever had to do with ned land harpoon i
would not bet in it favour
the frigat skirt the southeast coast of america with great
rapid the 3rd of juli we were at the open of the strait of
magellan level with cape vierg but command farragut would not
take a tortuou passag but doubl cape horn
the ship crew agre with him and certainli it wa possibl that
thei might meet the narwhal in thi narrow pass mani of the sailor
affirm that the monster could not pass there that he wa too big
for that
the 6th of juli about three oclock in the afternoon the abraham
lincoln at fifteen mile to the south doubl the solitari island
thi lost rock at the extrem of the american contin to which
some dutch sailor gave the name of their nativ town cape horn the
cours wa taken toward the northwest and the next dai the screw of
the frigat wa at last beat the water of the pacif
keep your ey open call out the sailor
and thei were open wide both ey and glass a littl dazzl
it is true by the prospect of two thousand dollar had not an
instant repos dai and night thei watch the surfac of the ocean
and even nyctalop whose faculti of see in the dark multipli
their chanc a hundredfold would have had enough to do to gain the
prize
i myself for whom monei had no charm wa not the least attent on
board give but few minut to my meal but a few hour to sleep
indiffer to either rain or sunshin i did not leav the poop of the
vessel now lean on the net of the forecastl now on the
taffrail i devour with eager the soft foam which whiten the
sea as far as the ey could reach and how often have i share the
emot of the major of the crew when some caprici whale rais
it black back abov the wave the poop of the vessel wa crowd in a
moment the cabin pour forth a torrent of sailor and offic each
with heav breast and troubl ey watch the cours of the
cetacean i look and look till i wa nearli blind whilst conseil
alwai phlegmat kept repeat in a calm voic
if sir you would not squint so much you would see better
but vain excit the abraham lincoln check it speed and made
for the anim signal a simpl whale or common cachalot which
soon disappear amidst a storm of execr
but the weather wa good the voyag wa be accomplish under the
most favour auspic it wa then the bad season in australia the
juli of that zone correspond to our januari in europ but the sea
wa beauti and easili scan round a vast circumfer
the 20th of juli the tropic of capricorn wa cut by 105 of longitud
and the 27th of the same month we cross the equat on the 110th
meridian thi pass the frigat took a more decid westerli
direct and scour the central water of the pacif command
farragut thought and with reason that it wa better to remain in deep
water and keep clear of contin or island which the beast itself
seem to shun perhap becaus there wa not enough water for him
suggest the greater part of the crew the frigat pass at some
distanc from the marquesa and the sandwich island cross the
tropic of cancer and made for the china sea we were on the theatr
of the last divers of the monster and to sai truth we no longer
live on board heart palpit fearfulli prepar themselv for
futur incur aneur the entir ship crew were undergo a
nervou excit of which i can give no idea thei could not eat
thei could not sleeptwenti time a dai a misconcept or an optic
illus of some sailor seat on the taffrail would caus dread
perspir and these emot twenti time repeat kept us in a
state of excit so violent that a reaction wa unavoid
and truli reaction soon show itself for three month dure which
a dai seem an ag the abraham lincoln furrow all the water of
the northern pacif run at whale make sharp deviat from
her cours veer suddenli from on tack to anoth stop
suddenli put on steam and back ever and anon at the risk of
derang her machineri and not on point of the japanes or american
coast wa left unexplor
the warmest partisan of the enterpris now becam it most ardent
detractor reaction mount from the crew to the captain himself and
certainli had it not been for resolut determin on the part of
captain farragut the frigat would have head due southward thi
useless search could not last much longer the abraham lincoln had
noth to reproach herself with she had done her best to succe
never had an american ship crew shown more zeal or patienc it
failur could not be place to their chargether remain noth but
to return
thi wa repres to the command the sailor could not hide their
discont and the servic suffer i will not sai there wa a mutini
on board but after a reason period of obstinaci captain farragut
as columbu did ask for three dai patienc if in three dai the
monster did not appear the man at the helm should give three turn of
the wheel and the abraham lincoln would make for the european sea
thi promis wa made on the 2nd of novemb it had the effect of
ralli the ship crew the ocean wa watch with renew attent
each on wish for a last glanc in which to sum up hi remembr
glass were us with feverish activ it wa a grand defianc given
to the giant narwhal and he could scarc fail to answer the summon
and appear
two dai pass the steam wa at half pressur a thousand scheme
were tri to attract the attent and stimul the apathi of the
anim in case it should be met in those part larg quantiti of
bacon were trail in the wake of the ship to the great satisfact
i must sai of the shark small craft radiat in all direct
round the abraham lincoln as she lai to and did not leav a spot of
the sea unexplor but the night of the 4th of novemb arriv
without the unveil of thi submarin mysteri
the next dai the 5th of novemb at twelv the delai would moral
speak expir after that time command farragut faith to hi
promis wa to turn the cours to the southeast and abandon for ever
the northern region of the pacif
the frigat wa then in 31 15 north latitud and 136 42 east
longitud the coast of japan still remain less than two hundr
mile to leeward night wa approach thei had just struck eight
bell larg cloud veil the face of the moon then in it first
quarter the sea undul peaceabl under the stern of the vessel
at that moment i wa lean forward on the starboard net conseil
stand near me wa look straight befor him the crew perch in
the ratlin examin the horizon which contract and darken by
degre offic with their night glass scour the grow
dark sometim the ocean sparkl under the rai of the moon
which dart between two cloud then all trace of light wa lost in
the dark
in look at conseil i could see he wa undergo a littl of the
gener influenc at least i thought so perhap for the first time
hi nerv vibrat to a sentiment of curios
come conseil said i thi is the last chanc of pocket the two
thousand dollar
mai i be permit to sai sir repli conseil that i never
reckon on get the prize and had the govern of the union
offer a hundr thousand dollar it would have been none the
poorer
you ar right conseil it is a foolish affair after all and on upon
which we enter too lightli what time lost what useless emot we
should have been back in franc six month ago
in your littl room sir repli conseil and in your museum sir

chapter vi
at full steam
at thi cry the whole ship crew hurri toward the
harpoonercommand offic master sailor cabin boi even the
engin left their engin and the stoker their furnac
the order to stop her had been given and the frigat now simpli went
on by her own momentum the dark wa then profound and howev
good the canadian ey were i ask myself how he had manag to
see and what he had been abl to see my heart beat as if it would
break but ned land wa not mistaken and we all perceiv the object
he point to at two cabl length from the abraham lincoln on the
starboard quarter the sea seem to be illumin all over it wa
not a mere phosphor phenomenon the monster emerg some fathom from
the water and then threw out that veri intens but inexplic light
mention in the report of sever captain thi magnific
irradi must have been produc by an agent of great shine
power the lumin part trace on the sea an immens oval much
elong the centr of which condens a burn heat whose
overpow brillianc di out by success gradat
it is onli an agglomer of phosphor particl cri on of the
offic
no sir certainli not i repli never did pholad or salp
produc such a power light that bright is of an essenti
electr natur besid see see it move it is move forward
backward it is dart toward us
a gener cry rose from the frigat
silenc said the captain up with the helm revers the engin
the steam wa shut off and the abraham lincoln beat to port
describ a semicircl
right the helm go ahead cri the captain
these order were execut and the frigat move rapidli from the
burn light
i wa mistaken she tri to sheer off but the supernatur anim
approach with a veloc doubl her own
we gasp for breath stupefact more than fear made us dumb and
motionless the anim gain on us sport with the wave it made
the round of the frigat which wa then make fourteen knot and
envelop it with it electr ring like lumin dust then it move
awai two or three mile leav a phosphoresc track like those
volum of steam that the express train leav behind all at onc from
the dark line of the horizon whither it retir to gain it momentum
the monster rush suddenli toward the abraham lincoln with alarm
rapid stop suddenli about twenti feet from the hull and di
outnot dive under the water for it brillianc did not abatebut
suddenli and as if the sourc of thi brilliant eman wa
exhaust then it reappear on the other side of the vessel as if it
had turn and slid under the hull ani moment a collis might have
occur which would have been fatal to us howev i wa astonish
at the manuvr of the frigat she fled and did not attack
on the captain face gener so impass wa an express of
unaccount astonish
mr aronnax he said i do not know with what formid be i
have to deal and i will not imprud risk my frigat in the midst
of thi dark besid how attack thi unknown thing how defend
on self from it wait for daylight and the scene will chang
you have no further doubt captain of the natur of the anim
no sir it is evid a gigant narwhal and an electr on
perhap ad i on can onli approach it with a gymnotu or a
torpedo
undoubtedli repli the captain if it possess such dread
power it is the most terribl anim that ever wa creat that is
why sir i must be on my guard
the crew were on their feet all night no on thought of sleep the
abraham lincoln not be abl to struggl with such veloc had
moder it pace and sail at half speed for it part the
narwhal imit the frigat let the wave rock it at will and
seem decid not to leav the scene of the struggl toward
midnight howev it disappear or to us a more appropri term
it di out like a larg glowworm had it fled on could onli fear
not hope but at seven minut to on oclock in the morn a
deafen whistl wa heard like that produc by a bodi of water
rush with great violenc
the captain ned land and i were then on the poop eagerli peer
through the profound dark
ned land ask the command you have often heard the roar of
whale
often sir but never such whale the sight of which brought me in two
thousand dollar if i can onli approach within four harpoon length of
it
but to approach it said the command i ought to put a whaler at
your dispos
certainli sir
that will be trifl with the live of my men
and mine too simpli said the harpoon
toward two oclock in the morn the burn light reappear not
less intens about five mile to windward of the abraham lincoln
notwithstand the distanc and the nois of the wind and sea on
heard distinctli the loud stroke of the anim tail and even it
pant breath it seem that at the moment that the enorm narwhal
had come to take breath at the surfac of the water the air wa
engulf in it lung like the steam in the vast cylind of a
machin of two thousand horsepow
hum thought i a whale with the strength of a cavalri regiment
would be a pretti whale
we were on the qui vive till daylight and prepar for the combat
the fish implement were laid along the hammock net the second
lieuten load the blunderbuss which could throw harpoon to the
distanc of a mile and long duckgun with explos bullet which
inflict mortal wound even to the most terribl anim ned land
content himself with sharpen hi harpoona terribl weapon in hi
hand
at six oclock dai began to break and with the first glimmer of
light the electr light of the narwhal disappear at seven oclock
the dai wa suffici advanc but a veri thick sea fog obscur
our view and the best spyglass could not pierc it that caus
disappoint and anger
i climb the mizzenmast some offic were alreadi perch on the
mast head at eight oclock the fog lai heavili on the wave and it
thick scroll rose littl by littl the horizon grew wider and clearer
at the same time suddenli just as on the dai befor ned land voic
wa heard
the thing itself on the port quarter cri the harpoon
everi ey wa turn toward the point indic there a mile and a
half from the frigat a long blackish bodi emerg a yard abov the
wave it tail violent agit produc a consider eddi
never did a caudal appendag beat the sea with such violenc an
immens track of dazzl white mark the passag of the anim
and describ a long curv
the frigat approach the cetacean i examin it thoroughli
the report of the shannon and of the helvetia had rather
exagger it size and i estim it length at onli two hundr
and fifti feet as to it dimens i could onli conjectur them to
be admir proport while i watch thi phenomenon two jet of
steam and water were eject from it vent and rose to the height of
120 feet thu i ascertain it wai of breath i conclud
definit that it belong to the vertebr branch class mammalia
the crew wait impati for their chief order the latter after
have observ the anim attent call the engin the
engin ran to him
sir said the command you have steam up
ye sir answer the engin
well make up your fire and put on all steam
three hurrah greet thi order the time for the struggl had
arriv some moment after the two funnel of the frigat vomit
torrent of black smoke and the bridg quak under the trembl of
the boiler
the abraham lincoln propel by her wonder screw went straight
at the anim the latter allow it to come within half a cabl
length then as if disdain to dive it took a littl turn and
stop a short distanc off
thi pursuit last nearli threequart of an hour without the
frigat gain two yard on the cetacean it wa quit evid that at
that rate we should never come up with it
well mr land ask the captain do you advis me to put the boat
out to sea
no sir repli ned land becaus we shall not take that beast
easili
what shall we do then
put on more steam if you can sir with your leav i mean to post
myself under the bowsprit and if we get within harpoon distanc i
shall throw my harpoon
go ned said the captain engin put on more pressur
ned land went to hi post the fire were increas the screw revolv
fortythre time a minut and the steam pour out of the valv we
heav the log and calcul that the abraham lincoln wa go at
the rate of 18 mile an hour
but the accurs anim swam too at the rate of 18 mile an hour
for a whole hour the frigat kept up thi pace without gain six
feet it wa humili for on of the swiftest sailer in the
american navi a stubborn anger seiz the crew the sailor abus the
monster who as befor disdain to answer them the captain no
longer content himself with twist hi beardh gnaw it
the engin wa again call
you have turn full steam in
ye sir repli the engin
the speed of the abraham lincoln increas it mast trembl down
to their step hole and the cloud of smoke could hardli find wai
out of the narrow funnel
thei heav the log a second time
well ask the captain of the man at the wheel
nineteen mile and threetenth sir
clap on more steam
the engin obei the manomet show ten degre but the cetacean
grew warm itself no doubt for without strain itself it made
19310 mile
what a pursuit no i cannot describ the emot that vibrat through
me ned land kept hi post harpoon in hand sever time the anim
let us gain upon itw shall catch it we shall catch it cri the
canadian but just as he wa go to strike the cetacean stole awai
with a rapid that could not be estim at less than thirti mile
an hour and even dure our maximum of speed it bulli the frigat
go round and round it a cry of furi broke from everyon
at noon we were no further advanc than at eight oclock in the
morn
the captain then decid to take more direct mean
ah said he that anim goe quicker than the abraham lincoln
veri well we will see whether it will escap these conic bullet
send your men to the forecastl sir
the forecastl gun wa immedi load and slew round but the
shot pass some feet abov the cetacean which wa half a mile off
anoth more to the right cri the command and five dollar to
whoever will hit that infern beast
an old gunner with a grei beardthat i can see nowwith steadi ey and
grave face went up to the gun and took a long aim a loud report wa
heard with which were mingl the cheer of the crew
illustr an old greybeard gunner
the bullet did it work it hit the anim but not fatal and
slide off the round surfac wa lost in two mile depth of sea
the chase began again and the captain lean toward me said
i will pursu that beast till my frigat burst up
ye answer i and you will be quit right to do it
i wish the beast would exhaust itself and not be insens to
fatigu like a steam engin but it wa of no us hour pass
without it show ani sign of exhaust
howev it must be said in prais of the abraham lincoln that she
struggl on indefatig i cannot reckon the distanc she made under
three hundr mile dure thi unlucki dai novemb the 6th but
night came on and overshadow the rough ocean
now i thought our expedit wa at an end and that we should never
again see the extraordinari anim i wa mistaken at ten minut to
eleven in the even the electr light reappear three mile to
windward of the frigat as pure as intens as dure the preced
night
the narwhal seem motionless perhap tire with it dai work it
slept let itself float with the undul of the wave now wa a
chanc of which the captain resolv to take advantag
he gave hi order the abraham lincoln kept up half steam and
advanc cautious so as not to awak it adversari it is no rare
thing to meet in the middl of the ocean whale so sound asleep that
thei can be successfulli attack and ned land had harpoon more than
on dure it sleep the canadian went to take hi place again under
the bowsprit
the frigat approach noiselessli stop at two cabl length from
the anim and follow it track no on breath a deep silenc
reign on the bridg we were not a hundr feet from the burn
focu the light of which increas and dazzl our ey
at thi moment lean on the forecastl bulwark i saw below me ned
land grappl the martingal in on hand brandish hi terribl
harpoon in the other scarc twenti feet from the motionless anim
suddenli hi arm straighten and the harpoon wa thrown i heard the
sonor stroke of the weapon which seem to have struck a hard bodi
the electr light went out suddenli and two enorm waterspout
broke over the bridg of the frigat rush like a torrent from stem
to stern overthrow men and break the lash of the spar a
fear shock follow and thrown over the rail without have time
to stop myself i fell into the sea
chapter vii
an unknown speci of whale
thi unexpect fall so stun me that i have no clear recollect of
my sensat at the time i wa at first drawn down to a depth of
about twenti feet i am a good swimmer though without pretend to
rival byron or edgar poe who were master of the art and in that
plung i did not lose my presenc of mind two vigor stroke brought
me to the surfac of the water my first care wa to look for the
frigat had the crew seen me disappear had the abraham lincoln
veer round would the captain put out a boat might i hope to be
save
the dark wa intens i caught a glimps of a black mass
disappear in the east it beacon light dy out in the distanc
it wa the frigat i wa lost
help help i shout swim toward the abraham lincoln in
desper
my cloth encumb me thei seem glu to my bodi and paralys
my movement
i wa sink i wa suffoc
help
thi wa my last cry my mouth fill with water i struggl against
be drawn down the abyss suddenli my cloth were seiz by a strong
hand and i felt myself quickli drawn up to the surfac of the sea and
i heard ye i heard these word pronounc in my ear
if master would be so good as to lean on my shoulder master would
swim with much greater eas
i seiz with on hand my faith conseil arm
is it you said i you
myself answer conseil and wait master order
that shock threw you as well as me into the sea
no but be in my master servic i follow him
the worthi fellow thought that wa but natur
and the frigat i ask
the frigat repli conseil turn on hi back i think that
master had better not count too much on her
you think so
i sai that at the time i threw myself into the sea i heard the men
at the wheel sai the screw and the rudder ar broken
broken
ye broken by the monster teeth it is the onli injuri the abraham
lincoln ha sustain but it is a bad look out for ussh no longer
answer her helm
then we ar lost
perhap so calmli answer conseil howev we have still sever
hour befor us and on can do a good deal in some hour
conseil imperturb cool set me up again i swam more
vigor but cramp by my cloth which stuck to me like a leaden
weight i felt great difficulti in bear up conseil saw thi
will master let me make a slit said he and slip an open knife
under my cloth he rip them up from top to bottom veri rapidli
then he cleverli slip them off me while i swam for both of us
then i did the same for conseil and we continu to swim near to each
other
nevertheless our situat wa no less terribl perhap our
disappear had not been notic and if it had been the frigat
could not tack be without it helm conseil argu on thi
supposit and laid hi plan accordingli thi phlegmat boi wa
perfectli selfpossess we then decid that as our onli chanc of
safeti wa be pick up by the abraham lincoln boat we ought
to manag so as to wait for them as long as possibl i resolv then
to husband our strength so that both should not be exhaust at the
same time and thi is how we manag while on of us lai on our back
quit still with arm cross and leg stretch out the other would
swim and push the other on in front thi tow busi did not last
more than ten minut each and reliev each other thu we could
swim on for some hour perhap till daybreak poor chanc but hope is
so firmli root in the heart of man moreov there were two of us
inde i declar though it mai seem improb if i sought to destroi
all hopeif i wish to despair i could not
the collis of the frigat with the cetacean had occur about
eleven oclock the even befor i reckon then we should have eight
hour to swim befor sunris an oper quit practic if we
reliev each other the sea veri calm wa in our favour sometim i
tri to pierc the intens dark that wa onli dispel by the
phosphoresc caus by our movement i watch the lumin wave
that broke over my hand whose mirrorlik surfac wa spot with
silveri ring on might have said that we were in a bath of
quicksilv
near on oclock in the morn i wa seiz with dread fatigu my
limb stiffen under the strain of violent cramp conseil wa oblig
to keep me up and our preserv devolv on him alon i heard the
poor boi pant hi breath becam short and hurri i found that he
could not keep up much longer
leav me leav me i said to him
leav my master never repli he i would drown first
just then the moon appear through the fring of a thick cloud that
the wind wa drive to the east the surfac of the sea glitter with
it rai thi kindli light reanim us my head got better again i
look at all point of the horizon i saw the frigat she wa five
mile from us and look like a dark mass hardli discern but no
boat
i would have cri out but what good would it have been at such a
distanc my swollen lip could utter no sound conseil could
articul some word and i heard him repeat at interv help
help
our movement were suspend for an instant we listen it might be
onli a sing in the ear but it seem to me as if a cry answer the
cry from conseil
did you hear i murmur
ye ye
and conseil gave on more despair call
thi time there wa no mistak a human voic respond to our wa it
the voic of anoth unfortun creatur abandon in the middl of
the ocean some other victim of the shock sustain by the vessel or
rather wa it a boat from the frigat that wa hail us in the
dark
conseil made a last effort and lean on my shoulder while i struck
out in a despair effort he rais himself half out of the water
then fell back exhaust
what did you see
i sawmurmur he i sawbut do not talkreserv all your strength
what had he seen then i know not why the thought of the monster came
into my head for the first time but that voic the time is past for
jonah to take refug in whale belli howev conseil wa tow
me again he rais hi head sometim look befor us and utter a
cry of recognit which wa respond to by a voic that came nearer
and nearer i scarc heard it my strength wa exhaust my finger
stiffen my hand afford me support no longer my mouth
convuls open fill with salt water cold crept over me i
rais my head for the last time then i sank
at thi moment a hard bodi struck me i clung to it then i felt that i
wa be drawn up that i wa brought to the surfac of the water
that my chest collapsedi faint
it is certain that i soon came to thank to the vigor rub that
i receiv i half open my ey
conseil i murmur
doe master call me ask conseil
just then by the wane light of the moon which wa sink down to
the horizon i saw a face which wa not conseil and which i
immedi recognis
ned i cri
the same sir who is seek hi prize repli the canadian
were you thrown into the sea by the shock to the frigat
ye professor but more fortun than you i wa abl to find a
foot almost directli upon a float island

or more correctli speak on our gigant narwhal
explain yourself ned
onli i soon found out why my harpoon had not enter it skin and wa
blunt
why ned why
becaus professor that beast is made of sheet iron
the canadian last word produc a sudden revolut in my brain i
wriggl myself quickli to the top of the be or object half out of
the water which serv us for a refug i kick it it wa evid
a hard impenetr bodi and not the soft substanc that form the
bodi of the great marin mammalia but thi hard bodi might be a boni
carapac like that of the antediluvian anim and i should be free
to class thi monster among amphibi reptil such as tortois or
allig
well no the blackish back that support me wa smooth polish
without scale the blow produc a metal sound and incred
though it mai be it seem i might sai as if it wa made of rivet
plate
there wa no doubt about it thi monster thi natur phenomenon that
had puzzl the learn world and overthrown and misl the
imagin of seamen of both hemispher it must be own a still
more astonish phenomenon inasmuch as it wa a simpli human
construct
we had no time to lose howev we were ly upon the back of a sort
of submarin boat which appear as far as i could judg like a huge
fish of steel ned land mind wa made up on thi point conseil and i
could onli agre with him
just then a bubbl began at the back of thi strang thing which wa
evid propel by a screw and it began to move we had onli just
time to seiz hold of the upper part which rose about seven feet out
of the water and happili it speed wa not great
as long as it sail horizont mutter ned land i do not mind
but if it take a fanci to dive i would not give two straw for my
life
the canadian might have said still less it becam realli necessari to
commun with the be whatev thei were shut up insid the
machin i search all over the outsid for an apertur a panel or a
manhol to us a technic express but the line of the iron
rivet solidli driven into the joint of the iron plate were clear
and uniform besid the moon disappear then and left us in total
dark
at last thi long night pass my indistinct remembr prevent my
describ all the impress it made i can onli recal on
circumst dure some lull of the wind and sea i fanci i heard
sever time vagu sound a sort of fugit harmoni produc by
word of command what wa then the mysteri of thi submarin craft of
which the whole world vainli sought an explan what kind of be
exist in thi strang boat what mechan agent caus it
prodigi speed
daybreak appear the morn mist surround us but thei soon
clear off i wa about to examin the hull which form on deck a
kind of horizont platform when i felt it gradual sink
oh confound it cri ned land kick the resound plate open
you inhospit rascal
happili the sink movement ceas suddenli a nois like iron work
violent push asid came from the interior of the boat on iron
plate wa move a man appear utter an odd cry and disappear

some moment after eight strong men with mask face appear
noiselessli and drew us down into their formid machin

i repli in good french that i did not know hi languag but he

if master were to tell our stori said conseil perhap these

if master will permit me i will relat it in german
but in spite of the eleg term and good accent of the narrat the
german languag had no success at last nonpluss i tri to
rememb my first lesson and to narrat our adventur in latin but
with no better success thi last attempt be of no avail the two
stranger exchang some word in their unknown languag and retir
the door shut
it is an infam shame cri ned land who broke out for the
twentieth time we speak to those rogu in french english german
and latin and not on of them ha the polit to answer
calm yourself i said to the impetu ned anger will do no good
but do you see professor repli our irasc companion that we

bah said conseil philosoph we can hold out some time yet
my friend i said we must not despair we have been wors off than
thi do me the favour to wait a littl befor form an opinion upon
the command and crew of thi boat
my opinion is form repli ned land sharpli thei ar rascal
good and from what countri
from the land of rogu
my brave ned that countri is not clearli indic on the map of the
world but i admit that the nation of the two stranger is hard to
determin neither english french nor german that is quit certain
howev i am inclin to think that the command and hi companion
were born in low latitud there is southern blood in them but i
cannot decid by their appear whether thei ar spaniard turk
arabian or indian as to their languag it is quit
incomprehens
there is the disadvantag of not know all languag said conseil
or the disadvantag of not have on univers languag
as he said these word the door open a steward enter he brought
us cloth coat and trouser made of a stuff i did not know i
hasten to dress myself and my companion follow my exampl dure
that time the stewarddumb perhap deafhad arrang the tabl and
laid three plate
thi is someth like said conseil
bah said the rancor harpoon what do you suppos thei eat
here tortois liver fillet shark and beefsteak from seadog
we shall see said conseil
the dish of bell metal were place on the tabl and we took our
place undoubtedli we had to do with civilis peopl and had it not
been for the electr light which flood us i could have fanci i
wa in the diningroom of the adelphi hotel at liverpool or at the
grand hotel in pari i must sai howev that there wa neither bread
nor wine the water wa fresh and clear but it wa water and did not
suit ned land tast amongst the dish which were brought to us i
recognis sever fish delic dress but of some although
excel i could give no opinion neither could i tell to what
kingdom thei belong whether anim or veget as to the dinner
servic it wa eleg and in perfect tast each utensil spoon
fork knife plate had a letter engrav on it with a motto abov it
of which thi is an exact facsimil

the letter n wa no doubt the initi of the name of the enigmat
person who command at the bottom of the sea
ned and conseil did not reflect much thei devour the food and i did
likewis i wa besid reassur as to our fate and it seem
evid that our host would not let us die of want
howev everyth ha an end everyth pass awai even the hunger
of peopl who have not eaten for fifteen hour our appetit
satisfi we felt overcom with sleep
faith i shall sleep well said conseil
so shall i repli ned land
my two companion stretch themselv on the cabin carpet and were
soon sound asleep for my own part too mani thought crowd my brain
too mani insolubl question press upon me too mani fanci kept my
ey half open where were we what strang power carri us on i
feltor rather fanci i feltth machin sink down to the lowest
bed of the sea dread nightmar beset me i saw in these
mysteri asylum a world of unknown anim amongst which thi
submarin boat seem to be of the same kind live move and
formid as thei then my brain grew calmer my imagin wander
into vagu unconsci and i soon fell into a deep sleep
chapter ix
ned land temper
how long we slept i do not know but our sleep must have last long
for it rest us complet from our fatigu i woke first my
companion had not move and were still stretch in their corner
hardli rous from my somewhat hard couch i felt my brain freed my
mind clear i then began an attent examin of our cell noth
wa chang insid the prison wa still a prisonth prison
prison howev the steward dure our sleep had clear the
tabl i breath with difficulti the heavi air seem to oppress my
lung although the cell wa larg we had evid consum a great
part of the oxygen that it contain inde each man consum in on
hour the oxygen contain in more than 176 pint of air and thi air
charg as then with a nearli equal quantiti of carbon acid
becom unbreath
it becam necessari to renew the atmospher of our prison and no doubt
the whole in the submarin boat that gave rise to a question in my
mind how would the command of thi float dwellingplac proce
would he obtain air by chemic mean in get by heat the oxygen
contain in chlorat of potash and in absorb carbon acid by
caustic potash or a more conveni econom and consequ
more probabl altern would he be satisfi to rise and take
breath at the surfac of the water like a cetacean and so renew for
twentyfour hour the atmospher provis
in fact i wa alreadi oblig to increas my respir to ek out
of thi cell the littl oxygen it contain when suddenli i wa
refresh by a current of pure air and perfum with salin
eman it wa an invigor sea breez charg with iodin i
open my mouth wide and my lung satur themselv with fresh
particl
at the same time i felt the boat roll the ironpl monster had
evid just risen to the surfac of the ocean to breath after the
fashion of whale i found out from that the mode of ventil the
boat
when i had inhal thi air freeli i sought the conduitpip which
convei to us the benefici whiff and i wa not long in find it
abov the door wa a ventil through which volum of fresh air
renew the impoverish atmospher of the cell
i wa make my observ when ned and conseil awok almost at the
same time under the influenc of thi reviv air thei rub their
ey stretch themselv and were on their feet in an instant
did master sleep well ask conseil with hi usual polit
veri well my brave boi and you mr land
soundli professor but i dont know if i am right or not there seem
to be a sea breez
a seaman could not be mistaken and i told the canadian all that had
pass dure hi sleep
good said he that account for those roar we heard when the
suppos narwhal sight the abraham lincoln
quit so master land it wa take breath
onli mr aronnax i have no idea what oclock it is unless it is
dinnertim
dinnertim my good fellow sai rather breakfasttim for we
certainli have begun anoth dai
so said conseil we have slept twentyfour hour
that is my opinion
i will not contradict you repli ned land but dinner or
breakfast the steward will be welcom whichev he bring
master land we must conform to the rule on board and i suppos our
appetit ar in advanc of the dinner hour
that is just like you friend conseil said ned impati you
ar never out of temper alwai calm you would return thank befor
grace and die of hunger rather than complain
time wa get on and we were fearfulli hungri and thi time the
steward did not appear it wa rather too long to leav us if thei
realli had good intent toward us ned land torment by the
crave of hunger got still more angri and notwithstand hi
promis i dread an explos when he found himself with on of the
crew
for two hour more ned land temper increas he cri he shout
but in vain the wall were deaf there wa no sound to be heard in the
boat all wa still as death it did not move for i should have felt
the trembl motion of the hull under the influenc of the screw
plung in the depth of the water it belong no longer to
earththi silenc wa dread
i felt terrifi conseil wa calm ned land roar
just then a nois wa heard outsid step sound on the metal flag
the lock were turn the door open and the steward appear
befor i could rush forward to stop him the canadian had thrown him
down and held him by the throat the steward wa choke under the
grip of hi power hand
conseil wa alreadi try to unclasp the harpoon hand from hi
halfsuffoc victim and i wa go to fly to the rescu when
suddenli i wa nail to the spot by hear these word in french
be quiet master land and you professor will you be so good as to
listen to me
chapter x
the man of the sea
it wa the command of the vessel who thu spoke
at these word ned land rose suddenli the steward nearli strangl
totter out on a sign from hi master but such wa the power of the
command on board that not a gestur betrai the resent which
thi man must have felt toward the canadian conseil interest in
spite of himself i stupefi await in silenc the result of thi
scene
the command lean against the corner of a tabl with hi arm
fold scan us with profound attent did he hesit to speak
did he regret the word which he had just spoken in french on might
almost think so
after some moment of silenc which not on of us dream of break
gentlemen said he in a calm and penetr voic i speak french
english german and latin equal well i could therefor have
answer you at our first interview but i wish to know you first
then to reflect the stori told by each on entir agre in the
main point convinc me of your ident i know now that chanc ha
brought befor me m pierr aronnax professor of natur histori at
the museum of pari entrust with a scientif mission abroad
conseil hi servant and ned land of canadian origin harpoon on
board the frigat abraham lincoln of the navi of the unit state of
america
i bow assent it wa not a question that the command put to me
therefor there wa no answer to be made thi man express himself
with perfect eas without ani accent hi sentenc were well turn
hi word clear and hi fluenci of speech remark yet i did not
recognis in him a fellowcountryman
he continu the convers in these term
you have doubtless thought sir that i have delai long in pai
you thi second visit the reason is that your ident recognis i
wish to weigh matur what part to act toward you i have hesit
much most annoi circumst have brought you into the presenc of
a man who ha broken all the ti of human you have come to troubl
my exist
unintention said i
unintention repli the stranger rais hi voic a littl
wa it unintention that the abraham lincoln pursu me all over
the sea wa it unintention that you took passag in thi frigat
wa it unintention that your cannon ball rebound off the plate
of my vessel wa it unintention that mr ned land struck me with
hi harpoon
i detect a restrain irrit in these word but to these
recrimin i had a veri natur answer to make and i made it
sir said i no doubt you ar ignor of the discuss which have
taken place concern you in america and europ you do not know that
diver accid caus by collis with your submarin machin
have excit public feel in the two contin i omit the
hypothes without number by which it wa sought to explain the
inexplic phenomenon of which you alon possess the secret but you
must understand that in pursu you over the high sea of the
pacif the abraham lincoln believ itself to be chase some
power seamonst of which it wa necessari to rid the ocean at ani
price
a halfsmil curl the lip of the command then in a calmer tone
m aronnax he repli dare you affirm that your frigat would not
as soon have pursu and cannonad a submarin boat as a monster
thi question embarrass me for certainli captain farragut might not
have hesit he might have thought it hi duti to destroi a
contriv of thi kind as he would a gigant narwhal
you understand then sir continu the stranger that i have the
right to treat you as enemi
i answer noth purpos for what good would it be to discuss
such a proposit when forc could destroi the best argument
i have hesit some time continu the command noth oblig
me to show you hospit if i chose to separ myself from you i
should have no interest in see you again i could place you upon the
deck of thi vessel which ha serv you as a refug i could sink
beneath the water and forget that you had ever exist would not
that be my right
it might be the right of a savag i answer but not that of a
civilis man
professor repli the command quickli i am not what you call a
civilis man i have done with societi entir for reason which i
alon have the right of appreci i do not therefor obei it law
and i desir you never to allud to them befor me again
thi wa said plainli a flash of anger and disdain kindl in the ey
of the unknown and i had a glimps of a terribl past in the life of
thi man not onli had he put himself beyond the pale of human law
but he had made himself independ of them free in the strictest
accept of the word quit beyond their reach who then would dare
to pursu him at the bottom of the sea when on it surfac he defi
all attempt made against him what vessel could resist the shock of
hi submarin monitor what cuirass howev thick could withstand the
blow of hi spur no man could demand from him an account of hi
action god if he believ in onehi conscienc if he had onewer
the sole judg to whom he wa answer
these reflect cross my mind rapidli whilst the stranger
personag wa silent absorb and as if wrap up in himself i
regard him with fear mingl with interest as doubtless dipu
regard the sphinx
after rather a long silenc the command resum the convers
i have hesit said he but i have thought that my interest might
be reconcil with that piti to which everi human be ha a right
you will remain on board my vessel sinc fate ha cast you there you
will be free and in exchang for thi liberti i shall onli impos
on singl condit your word of honour to submit to it will
suffic
speak sir i answer i suppos thi condit is on which a man
of honour mai accept
ye sir it is thi it is possibl that certain event unforeseen
mai oblig me to consign you to your cabin for some hour or some
dai as the case mai be as i desir never to us violenc i expect
from you more than all the other a passiv obedi in thu
act i take all the respons i acquit you entir for i
make it an imposs for you to see what ought not to be seen do
you accept thi condit
then thing took place on board which to sai the least were singular
and which ought not to be seen by peopl who were not place beyond the
pale of social law amongst the surpris which the futur wa
prepar for me thi might not be the least
we accept i answer onli i will ask your permiss sir to
address on question to youon onli
speak sir
you said that we should be free on board
entir
i ask you then what you mean by thi liberti
just the liberti to go to come to see to observ even all that
pass heresav under rare circumstancesth liberti in short
which we enjoi ourselv my companion and i
it wa evid that we did not understand on anoth
pardon me sir i resum but thi liberti is onli what everi
prison ha of pace hi prison it cannot suffic us
it must suffic you howev
what we must renounc for ever see our countri our friend our
relat again
ye sir but to renounc that unendur worldli yoke which men
believ to be liberti is not perhap so pain as you think
well exclaim ned land never will i give my word of honour not to
try to escap
i did not ask you for your word of honour master land answer the
command coldli
sir i repli begin to get angri in spite of myself you abus
your situat toward us it is cruelti
no sir it is clemenc you ar my prison of war i keep you when
i could by a word plung you into the depth of the ocean you
attack me you came to surpris a secret which no man in the world
must penetrateth secret of my whole exist and you think that i
am go to send you back to that world which must know me no more
never in retain you it is not you whom i guardit is myself
these word indic a resolut taken on the part of the command
against which no argument would prevail
so sir i rejoin you give us simpli the choic between life and
death
simpli
my friend said i to a question thu put there is noth to
answer but no word of honour bind us to the master of thi vessel
none sir answer the unknown
then in a gentler tone he continu
now permit me to finish what i have to sai to you i know you m
aronnax you and your companion will not perhap have so much to
complain of in the chanc which ha bound you to my fate you will find
amongst the book which ar my favourit studi the work which you have

carri out your work as far as terrestri scienc permit you but
you do not know allyou have not seen all let me tell you then
professor that you will not regret the time pass on board my vessel
you ar go to visit the land of marvel
these word of the command had a great effect upon me i cannot deni
it my weak point wa touch and i forgot for a moment that the
contempl of these sublim subject wa not worth the loss of
liberti besid i trust to the futur to decid thi grave
question so i content myself with sai
by what name ought i to address you
sir repli the command i am noth to you but captain nemo
and you and your companion ar noth to me but the passeng of the
nautilu

i found myself in a kind of passag light by electr similar to
the waist of a ship after we had proceed a dozen yard a second
door open befor me
i then enter a diningroom decor and furnish in sever tast
high oaken sideboard inlaid with eboni stood at the two extrem
of the room and upon their shelv glitter china porcelain and
glass of inestim valu the plate on the tabl sparkl in the rai
which the lumin ceil shed around while the light wa temper
and soften by exquisit paint
in the centr of the room wa a tabl richli laid out captain nemo
indic the place i wa to occupi
the breakfast consist of a certain number of dish the content of
which were furnish by the sea alon and i wa ignor of the natur
and mode of prepar of some of them i acknowledg that thei were
good but thei had a peculiar flavour which i easili becam accustom
to these differ aliment appear to me to be rich in phosphoru
and i thought thei must have a marin origin
captain nemo look at me i ask him no question but he guess my
thought and answer of hi own accord the question which i wa
burn to address to him
the greater part of these dish ar unknown to you he said to me
howev you mai partak of them without fear thei ar wholesom and

myself and which is alwai sown by the hand of the creator of all
thing
i can understand perfectli sir that your net furnish excel fish
for your tabl i can understand also that you hunt aquat game in
your submarin forest but i cannot understand at all how a particl
of meat no matter how small can figur in your bill of fare
thi which you believ to be meat professor is noth els than
fillet of turtl here ar also some dolphin liver which you take
to be ragout of pork my cook is a clever fellow who excel in
dress these variou product of the ocean tast all these dish
here is a preserv of holothuria which a malai would declar to be
unrival in the world here is a cream of which the milk ha been
furnish by the cetacea and the sugar by the great fucu of the north
sea and lastli permit me to offer you some preserv of anemon
which is equal to that of the most delici fruit
i tast more from curios than as a connoisseur whilst captain
nemo enchant me with hi extraordinari stori
you like the sea captain
ye i love it the sea is everyth it cover sevententh of the
terrestri globe it breath is pure and healthi it is an immens
desert where man is never lone for he feel life stir on all
side the sea is onli the embodi of a supernatur and wonder
exist it is noth but love and emot it is the live
infinit as on of your poet ha said in fact professor natur
manifest herself in it by her three kingdom miner veget and
anim the sea is the vast reservoir of natur the globe began with
sea so to speak and who know if it will not end with it in it is
suprem tranquil the sea doe not belong to despot upon it
surfac men can still exercis unjust law fight tear on anoth to
piec and be carri awai with terrestri horror but at thirti
feet below it level their reign ceas their influenc is quench
and their power disappear ah sir livel in the bosom of the
water there onli is independ there i recognis no master there
i am free
captain nemo suddenli becam silent in the midst of thi enthusiasm by
which he wa quit carri awai for a few moment he pace up and
down much agit then he becam more calm regain hi accustom
cold of express and turn toward me
now professor said he if you wish to go over the nautilu i am
at your servic
captain nemo rose i follow him a doubl door contriv at the back
of the diningroom open and i enter a room equal in dimens to
that which i had just quit
it wa a librari high piec of furnitur of black violet eboni
inlaid with brass support upon their wide shelv a great number of
book uniformli bound thei follow the shape of the room termin
at the lower part in huge divan cover with brown leather which
were curv to afford the greatest comfort light movabl desk made
to slide in and out at will allow on to rest on book while
read in the centr stood an immens tabl cover with pamphlet
amongst which were some newspap alreadi of old date the electr
light flood everyth it wa shed from four unpolish globe half
sunk in the volut of the ceil i look with real admir at
thi room so ingeni fit up and i could scarc believ my
ey
captain nemo said i to my host who had just thrown himself on on
of the divan thi is a librari which would do honour to more than
on of the continent palac and i am absolut astound when i
consid that it can follow you to the bottom of the sea
where could on find greater solitud or silenc professor repli
captain nemo did your studi in the museum afford you such perfect
quiet
no sir and i must confess that it is a veri poor on after your
you must have six or seven thousand volum here
twelv thousand m aronnax these ar the onli ti which bind me to
the earth but i had done with the world on the dai when my nautilu
plung for the first time beneath the water that dai i bought my
last volum my last pamphlet my last paper and from that time i
wish to think that men no longer think or write these book
professor ar at your servic besid and you can make us of them
freeli
i thank captain nemo and went up to the shelv of the librari
work on scienc moral and literatur abound in everi languag
but i did not see on singl work on polit economi that subject
appear to be strictli proscrib strang to sai all these book
were irregularli arrang in whatev languag thei were written and
thi medlei prove that the captain of the nautilu must have read
indiscrimin the book which he took up by chanc
sir said i to the captain i thank you for have place thi
librari at my dispos it contain treasur of scienc and i shall
profit by them
thi room is not onli a librari said captain nemo it is also a
smokingroom
a smokingroom i cri then on mai smoke on board
certainli
then sir i am forc to believ that you have kept up a
commun with havannah
not ani answer the captain accept thi cigar m aronnax and
though it doe not come from havannah you will be pleas with it if
you ar a connoisseur
i took the cigar which wa offer me it shape recal the london
on but it seem to be made of leav of gold i light it at a
littl brazier which wa support upon an eleg bronz stem and
drew the first whiff with the delight of a lover of smoke who ha
not smoke for two dai
it is excel but it is not tobacco
no answer the captain thi tobacco come neither from havannah
nor from the east it is a kind of seawe rich in nicotin with
which the sea provid me but somewhat sparingli
at that moment captain nemo open a door which stood opposit to that
by which i had enter the librari and i pass into an immens
drawingroom splendidli light
it wa a vast foursid room thirti feet long eighteen wide and
fifteen high a lumin ceil decor with light arabesqu shed
a soft clear light over all the marvel accumul in thi museum for
it wa in fact a museum in which an intellig and prodig hand had
gather all the treasur of natur and art with the artist
confus which distinguish a painter studio
thirti firstrat pictur uniformli frame separ by bright
draperi ornament the wall which were hung with tapestri of sever

some admir statu in marbl and bronz after the finest antiqu
model stood upon pedest in the corner of thi magnific museum
amaz as the captain of the nautilu had predict had alreadi
begun to take possess of me
professor said thi strang man you must excus the unceremoni
wai in which i receiv you and the disord of thi room
sir i answer without seek to know who you ar i recognis in
you an artist
an amateur noth more sir formerli i love to collect these
beauti work creat by the hand of man i sought them greedili and
ferret them out indefatig and i have been abl to bring togeth
some object of great valu these ar my last souvenir of that world
which is dead to me in my ey your modern artist ar alreadi old
thei have two or three thousand year of exist i confound them in

these musician repli captain nemo ar the contemporari of
orpheu for in the memori of the dead all chronolog differ
ar effac and i am dead professor as much dead as those of your

captain nemo wa silent and seem lost in a profound reveri i
contempl him with deep interest analys in silenc the strang

i did not disturb thi reveri and continu my observ of the

of persia for three million and surpass the on in the possess
of the imaum of muscat which i had believ to be unrival in the
world
therefor to estim the valu of thi collect wa simpli
imposs captain nemo must have expend million in the acquir
of these variou specimen and i wa think what sourc he could
have drawn from to have been abl thu to gratifi hi fanci for
collect when i wa interrupt by these word
you ar examin my shell professor unquestion thei must be
interest to a naturalist but for me thei have a far greater charm
for i have collect them all with my own hand and there is not a sea
on the face of the globe which ha escap my research
i can understand captain the delight of wander about in the midst
of such rich you ar on of those who have collect their treasur
themselv no museum in europ possess such a collect of the
produc of the ocean but if i exhaust all my admir upon it i
shall have none left for the vessel which carri it i do not wish to
pry into your secret but i must confess that thi nautilu with
the motiv power which is confin in it the contriv which enabl
it to be work the power agent which propel it all excit my
curios to the highest pitch i see suspend on the wall of thi
room instrument of whose us i am ignor
you will find these same instrument in my own room professor where
i shall have much pleasur in explain their us to you but first
come and inspect the cabin which is set apart for your own us you
must see how you will be accommod on board the nautilu
i follow captain nemo who by on of the door open from each
panel of the drawingroom regain the waist he conduct me toward
the bow and there i found not a cabin but an eleg room with a
bed dressingt and sever other piec of furnitur
i could onli thank my host
your room adjoin mine said he open a door and mine open into

chapter xi
all by electr
sir said captain nemo show me the instrument hang on the
wall of hi room here ar the contriv requir for the
navig of the nautilu here as in the drawingroom i have them
alwai under my ey and thei indic my posit and exact direct
in the middl of the ocean some ar known to you such as the
thermomet which give the intern temperatur of the nautilu
the baromet which indic the weight of the air and foretel the
chang of the weather the hygromet which mark the dryness of the
atmospher the stormglass the content of which by decompos
announc the approach of tempest the compass which guid my cours
the sextant which show the latitud by the altitud of the sun
chronomet by which i calcul the longitud and glass for dai
and night which i us to examin the point of the horizon when the
nautilu rise to the surfac of the wave
these ar the usual nautic instrument i repli and i know the
us of them but these other no doubt answer to the particular
requir of the nautilu thi dial with the movabl needl is a
manomet is it not
it is actual a manomet but by commun with the water whose
extern pressur it indic it give our depth at the same time
and these other instrument the us of which i cannot guess
here professor i ought to give you some explan will you be
kind enough to listen to me
he wa silent for a few moment then he said
there is a power agent obedi rapid easi which conform to
everi us and reign suprem on board my vessel everyth is done by
mean of it it light it warm it and is the soul of my mechan
apparatu thi agent is electr
electr i cri in surpris
ye sir
nevertheless captain you possess an extrem rapid of movement
which doe not agre with the power of electr until now it
dynam forc ha remain under restraint and ha onli been abl to
produc a small amount of power
professor said captain nemo my electr is not everybodi you
know what seawat is compos of in a thousand gramm ar found 96
per cent of water and about 223 per cent of chlorid of sodium
then in a smaller quantiti chlorid of magnesium and of potassium
bromid of magnesium sulphat of magnesia sulphat and carbon of
lime you see then that chlorid of sodium form a larg part of it
so it is thi sodium that i extract from seawat and of which i
compos my ingredi i ow all to the ocean it produc
electr and electr give heat light motion and in a word
life to the nautilu
but not the air you breath
oh i could manufactur the air necessari for my consumpt but it
is useless becaus i go up to the surfac of the water when i pleas
howev if electr doe not furnish me with air to breath it
work at least the power pump that ar store in spaciou
reservoir and which enabl me to prolong at need and as long as i
will my stai in the depth of the sea it give a uniform and
unintermitt light which the sun doe not now look at thi clock
it is electr and goe with a regular that defi the best
chronomet i have divid it into twentyfour hour like the
italian clock becaus for me there is neither night nor dai sun nor
moon but onli that factiti light that i take with me to the bottom
of the sea look just now it is ten oclock in the morn
exactli
anoth applic of electr thi dial hang in front of us
indic the speed of the nautilu an electr thread put it in
commun with the screw and the needl indic the real speed
look now we ar spin along with a uniform speed of fifteen mile
an hour
it is marvel and i see captain you were right to make us of
thi agent that take the place of wind water and steam
we have not finish m aronnax said captain nemo rise if you
will follow me we will examin the stern of the nautilu
realli i knew alreadi the anterior part of thi submarin boat of
which thi is the exact divis start from the ship headth
diningroom five yard long separ from the librari by a
watertight partit the librari five yard long the larg
drawingroom ten yard long separ from the captain room by a
second watertight partit the said room five yard in length
mine two and a half yard and lastli a reservoir of air seven and a
half yard that extend to the bow total length thirti five yard
or on hundr and five feet the partit had door that were shut
hermet by mean of indiarubb instrument and thei ensur the
safeti of the nautilu in case of a leak
i follow captain nemo through the waist and arriv at the centr of
the boat there wa a sort of well that open between two partit
an iron ladder fasten with an iron hook to the partit led to the
upper end i ask the captain what the ladder wa us for
it lead to the small boat he said
what have you a boat i exclaim in surpris
of cours an excel vessel light and insubmers that serv
either as a fish or as a pleasur boat
but then when you wish to embark you ar oblig to come to the
surfac of the water
not at all thi boat is attach to the upper part of the hull of the
nautilu and occupi a caviti made for it it is deck quit
watertight and held togeth by solid bolt thi ladder lead to a
manhol made in the hull of the nautilu that correspond with a
similar hole made in the side of the boat by thi doubl open i get
into the small vessel thei shut the on belong to the nautilu i
shut the other by mean of screw pressur i undo the bolt and the
littl boat goe up to the surfac of the sea with prodigi rapid
i then open the panel of the bridg carefulli shut till then i mast
it hoist my sail take my oar and im off
but how do you get back on board
i do not come back m aronnax the nautilu come to me
by your order
by my order an electr thread connect us i telegraph to it and
that is enough
realli i said astonish at these marvel noth can be more
simpl
after have pass by the cage of the staircas that led to the
platform i saw a cabin six feet long in which conseil and ned land
enchant with their repast were devour it with avid then a
door open into a kitchen nine feet long situat between the larg
storeroom there electr better than ga itself did all the
cook the stream under the furnac gave out to the spong of
platina a heat which wa regularli kept up and distribut thei also
heat a distil apparatu which by evapor furnish
excel drinkabl water near thi kitchen wa a bathroom comfort
furnish with hot and cold water tap
next to the kitchen wa the berthroom of the vessel sixteen feet long
but the door wa shut and i could not see the manag of it which
might have given me an idea of the number of men emploi on board the
nautilu
at the bottom wa a fourth partit that separ thi offic from
the engineroom a door open and i found myself in the compart
where captain nemocertainli an engin of a veri high orderhad
arrang hi locomot machineri thi engineroom clearli light
did not measur less than sixtyf feet in length it wa divid
into two part the first contain the materi for produc
electr and the second the machineri that connect it with the
screw i examin it with great interest in order to understand the
machineri of the nautilu
you see said the captain i us bunsen contriv not
ruhmkorff those would not have been power enough bunsen ar
fewer in number but strong and larg which experi prove to be
the best the electr produc pass forward where it work by
electromagnet of great size on a system of lever and cogwheel
that transmit the movement to the axl of the screw thi on the
diamet of which is nineteen feet and the thread twentythre feet
perform about a hundr and twenti revolut in a second
and you get then
a speed of fifti mile an hour
i have seen the nautilu manuvr befor the abraham lincoln and
i have my own idea as to it speed but thi is not enough we must
see where we go we must be abl to direct it to the right to the
left abov below how do you get to the great depth where you find
an increas resist which is rate by hundr of atmospher
how do you return to the surfac of the ocean and how do you maintain
yourselv in the requisit medium am i ask too much
not at all professor repli the captain with some hesit
sinc you mai never leav thi submarin boat come into the saloon
it is our usual studi and there you will learn all you want to know
about the nautilu
chapter xii
some figur
a moment after we were seat on a divan in the saloon smoke the
captain show me a sketch that gave the plan section and elev
of the nautilu then he began hi descript in these word
here m aronnax ar the sever dimens of the boat you ar in
it is an elong cylind with conic end it is veri like a cigar
in shape a shape alreadi adopt in london in sever construct of
the same sort the length of thi cylind from stem to stern is
exactli 232 feet and it maximum breadth is twentysix feet it is not
built quit like your longvoyag steamer but it line ar
suffici long and it curv prolong enough to allow the water
to slide off easili and oppos no obstacl to it passag these two
dimens enabl you to obtain by a simpl calcul the surfac and
cubic content of the nautilu it area measur 6032 feet and it
content about 1500 cubic yardsthat is to sai when complet
immers it displac 50000 feet of water or weigh 1500 ton
when i made the plan for thi submarin vessel i meant that
ninetenth should be submerg consequ it ought onli to
displac ninetenth of it bulkthat is to sai onli to weigh that
number of ton i ought not therefor to have exceed that weight
construct it on the aforesaid dimens
the nautilu is compos of two hull on insid the other
outsid join by tshape iron which render it veri strong inde
ow to thi cellular arrang it resist like a block as if it
were solid it side cannot yield it coher spontan and not
by the close of it rivet and the homogen of it construct
due to the perfect union of the materi enabl it to defi the
roughest sea
these two hull ar compos of steel plate whose densiti is from 7
to 8 that of water the first is not less than two inch and a half
thick and weigh 394 ton the second envelop the keel twenti inch
high and ten thick weigh alon sixtytwo ton the engin the
ballast the sever accessori and apparatu appendag the
partit and bulkhead weigh 96162 ton do you follow all thi
i do
then when the nautilu is afloat under these circumst
onetenth is out of the water now if i have made reservoir of a size
equal to thi tenth or capabl of hold 150 ton and if i fill them
with water the boat weigh then 1507 ton will be complet
immers that would happen professor these reservoir ar in the
lower part of the nautilu i turn on tap and thei fill and the
vessel sink that had just been level with the surfac
well captain but now we come to the real difficulti i can
understand your rise to the surfac but dive below the surfac
doe not your submarin contriv encount a pressur and
consequ undergo an upward thrust of on atmospher for everi
thirti feet of water just about fifteen pound per squar inch
just so sir
then unless you quit fill the nautilu i do not see how you can
draw it down to those depth
professor you must not confound static with dynam or you will be
expos to grave error there is veri littl labour spent in attain
the lower region of the ocean for all bodi have a tendenc to sink
when i want to find out the necessari increas of weight requir to
sink the nautilu i had onli to calcul the reduct of volum
that seawat acquir accord to the depth
that is evid
now if water is not absolut incompress it is at least capabl
of veri slight compress inde after the most recent calcul
thi reduct is onli 000436 of an atmospher for each thirti feet of
depth if we want to sink 3000 feet i should keep account of the
reduct of bulk under a pressur equal to that of a column of water
of a thousand feet the calcul is easili verifi now i have
supplementari reservoir capabl of hold a hundr ton therefor i
can sink to a consider depth when i wish to rise to the level of
the sea i onli let off the water and empti all the reservoir if i
want the nautilu to emerg from the tenth part of her total
capac
i had noth to object to these reason
i admit your calcul captain i repli i should be wrong to
disput them sinc daili experi confirm them but i forese a real
difficulti in the wai
what sir
when you ar about 1000 feet deep the wall of the nautilu bear a
pressur of 100 atmospher if then just now you were to empti the
supplementari reservoir to lighten the vessel and to go up to the
surfac the pump must overcom the pressur of 100 atmospher which
is 1500 pound per squar inch from that a power
that electr alon can give said the captain hastili i
repeat sir that the dynam power of my engin is almost infinit
the pump of the nautilu have an enorm power as you must have
observ when their jet of water burst like a torrent upon the
abraham lincoln besid i us subsidiari reservoir onli to attain a
mean depth of 750 to 1000 fathom and that with a view of manag my
machin also when i have a mind to visit the depth of the ocean
five or six mile below the surfac i make us of slower but not less
infal mean
what ar thei captain
that involv my tell you how the nautilu is work
i am impati to learn
to steer thi boat to starboard or port to turnin a word follow
a horizont plan i us an ordinari rudder fix on the back of the
sternpost and with on wheel and some tackl to steer by but i can
also make the nautilu rise and sink and sink and rise by a
vertic movement by mean of two inclin plane fasten to it
side opposit the centr of flotat plane that move in everi
direct and that ar work by power lever from the interior if
the plane ar kept parallel with the boat it move horizont if
slant the nautilu accord to thi inclin and under the
influenc of the screw either sink diagon or rise diagon as
it suit me and even if i wish to rise more quickli to the surfac i
ship the screw and the pressur of the water caus the nautilu to
rise vertic like a balloon fill with hydrogen
bravo captain but how can the steersman follow the rout in the
middl of the water
the steersman is place in a glaze box that is rais about the hull
of the nautilu and furnish with lens
ar these lens capabl of resist such pressur
perfectli glass which break at a blow is nevertheless capabl of
offer consider resist dure some experi of fish by
electr light in 1864 in the northern sea we saw plate less than a
third of an inch thick resist a pressur of sixteen atmospher now
the glass that i us is not less than thirti time thicker
grant but after all in order to see the light must exce the
dark and in the midst of the dark in the water how can you
see
behind the steersman cage is place a power electr reflector
the rai from which light up the sea for half a mile in front
ah bravo bravo captain now i can account for thi phosphoresc
in the suppos narwhal that puzzl us so i now ask you if the
board of the nautilu and of the scotia that ha made such a
nois ha been the result of a chanc rencontr
quit accident sir i wa sail onli on fathom below the surfac
of the water when the shock came it had no bad result
none sir but now about your rencontr with the abraham lincoln
professor i am sorri for on of the best vessel in the american
navi but thei attack me and i wa bound to defend myself i
content myself howev with put the frigat hor de combat
she will not have ani difficulti in get repair at the next port
ah command your nautilu is certainli a marvel boat
ye professor and i love it as if it were part of myself if danger
threaten on of your vessel on the ocean the first impress is the
feel of an abyss abov and below on the nautilu men heart
never fail them no defect to be afraid of for the doubl shell is as
firm as iron no rig to attend to no sail for the wind to carri
awai no boiler to burst no fire to fear for the vessel is made of
iron not of wood no coal to run short for electr is the onli
mechan agent no collis to fear for it alon swim in deep
water no tempest to brave for when it dive below the water it
reach absolut tranquil there sir that is the perfect of
vessel and if it is true that the engin ha more confid in the
vessel than the builder and the builder than the captain himself you
understand the trust i repos in my nautilu for i am at onc
captain builder and engin
but how could you construct thi wonder nautilu in secret
each separ portion m aronnax wa brought from differ part of
the globe the keel wa forg at creusot the shaft of the screw at
penn co london the iron plate of the hull at laird of
liverpool the screw itself at scott at glasgow the reservoir were
made by cail co at pari the engin by krupp in prussia it beak
in motala workshop in sweden it mathemat instrument by hart
brother of new york etc and each of these peopl had my order
under differ name
but these part had to be put togeth and arrang
professor i had set up my workshop upon a desert island in the
ocean there my workmen that is to sai the brave men that i
instruct and educ and myself have put togeth our nautilu
then when the work wa finish fire destroi all trace of our
proceed on thi island that i could have jump over if i had
like
then the cost of thi vessel is great
m aronnax an iron vessel cost 145 per ton now the nautilu
weigh 1500 it came therefor to 67500 and 80000 more for
fit it up and about 200000 with the work of art and the
collect it contain
on last question captain nemo
ask it professor
you ar rich
immens rich sir and i could without miss it pai the nation
debt of franc
i stare at the singular person who spoke thu wa he plai upon my
credul the futur would decid that

the ocean that my fate destin me first to travel over under these
strang condit
sir said captain nemo we will if you pleas take our bear
and fix the startingpoint of thi voyag it is a quarter to twelv i
will go up again to the surfac
the captain press an electr clock three time the pump began to
drive the water from the tank the needl of the manomet mark by a
differ pressur the ascent of the nautilu then it stop
we have arriv said the captain
i went to the central staircas which open on to the platform
clamber up the iron step and found myself on the upper part of the
nautilu
the platform wa onli three feet out of water the front and back of
the nautilu wa of that spindleshap which caus it justli to be
compar to a cigar i notic that it iron plate slightli
overlai each other resembl the shell which cloth the bodi of
our larg terrestri reptil it explain to me how natur it wa
in spite of all glass that thi boat should have been taken for a
marin anim
toward the middl of the platform the longboat half buri in the
hull of the vessel form a slight excresc fore and aft rose two
cage of medium height with inclin side and partli close by thick
lenticular glass on destin for the steersman who direct the
nautilu the other contain a brilliant lantern to give light on
the road
the sea wa beauti the sky pure scarc could the long vehicl
feel the broad undul of the ocean a light breez from the east
rippl the surfac of the water the horizon free from fog made
observ easi noth wa in sight not a quicksand not an island
a vast desert
captain nemo by the help of hi sextant took the altitud of the sun
which ought also to give the latitud he wait for some moment till
it disc touch the horizon whilst take observ not a muscl
move the instrument could not have been more motionless in a hand of
marbl
illustr captain nemo took the sun altitud
twelv oclock sir said he when you like
i cast a last look upon the sea slightli yellow by the japanes
coast and descend to the saloon
and now sir i leav you to your studi ad the captain our
cours is en our depth is twentysix fathom here ar map on a
larg scale by which you mai follow it the saloon is at your dispos
and with your permiss i will retir captain nemo bow and i
remain alon lost in thought all bear on the command of the
nautilu
for a whole hour wa i deep in these reflect seek to pierc
thi mysteri so interest to me then my ey fell upon the vast
planispher spread upon the tabl and i place my finger on the veri
spot where the given latitud and longitud cross
the sea ha it larg river like the contin thei ar special
current known by their temperatur and their colour the most
remark of these is known by the name of the gulf stream scienc
ha decid on the globe the direct of five princip current on
in the north atlant a second in the south a third in the north
pacif a fourth in the south and a fifth in the southern indian
ocean it is even probabl that a sixth current exist at on time or
anoth in the northern indian ocean when the caspian and aral sea
form but on vast sheet of water
at thi point indic on the planispher on of these current wa
roll the kuroscivo of the japanes the black river which
leav the gulf of bengal where it is warm by the perpendicular
rai of a tropic sun cross the strait of malacca along the coast
of asia turn into the north pacif to the aleutian island carri
with it trunk of camphortre and other indigen product and
edg the wave of the ocean with the pure indigo of it warm water
it wa thi current that the nautilu wa to follow i follow it
with my ey saw it lose itself in the vast of the pacif and
felt myself drawn with it when ned land and conseil appear at the
door of the saloon
my two brave companion remain petrifi at the sight of the wonder
spread befor them
where ar we where ar we exclaim the canadian in the museum at
quebec
my friend i answer make a sign for them to enter you ar not
in canada but on board the nautilu fifti yard below the level of
the sea
but m aronnax said ned land can you tell me how mani men there
ar on board ten twenti fifti a hundr
i cannot answer you mr land it is better to abandon for a time all
idea of seiz the nautilu or escap from it thi ship is a
masterpiec of modern industri and i should be sorri not to have seen
it mani peopl would accept the situat forc upon us if onli to
move amongst such wonder so be quiet and let us try and see what
pass around us
see exclaim the harpoon but we can see noth in thi iron
prison we ar walkingw ar sailingblindli
ned land had scarc pronounc these word when all wa suddenli
dark the lumin ceil wa gone and so rapidli that my ey
receiv a pain impress
we remain mute not stir and not know what surpris await
us whether agreeabl or disagre a slide nois wa heard on
would have said that panel were work at the side of the
nautilu
it is the end of the end said ned land
suddenli light broke at each side of the saloon through two oblong
open the liquid mass appear vividli lit up by the electr
gleam two crystal plate separ us from the sea at first i
trembl at the thought that thi frail partit might break but
strong band of copper bound them give an almost infinit power of
resist
the sea wa distinctli visibl for a mile all round the nautilu
what a spectacl what pen can describ it who could paint the effect
of the light through those transpar sheet of water and the
soft of the success gradat from the lower to the superior
strata of the ocean
we know the transpar of the sea and that it clear is far
beyond that of rockwat the miner and organ substanc which it
hold in suspens heighten it transpar in certain part of the
ocean at the antil under seventyf fathom of water can be seen
with surpris clear a bed of sand the penetr power of the
solar rai doe not seem to ceas for a depth of on hundr and fifti
fathom but in thi middl fluid travel over by the nautilu the
electr bright wa produc even in the bosom of the wave it wa
no longer lumin water but liquid light
on each side a window open into thi unexplor abyss the obscur
of the saloon show to advantag the bright outsid and we look
out as if thi pure crystal had been the glass of an immens aquarium
you wish to see friend ned well you see now
curiou curiou mutter the canadian who forget hi
illtemp seem to submit to some irresist attract and on
would come further than thi to admir such a sight
ah thought i to myself i understand the life of thi man he ha
made a world apart for himself in which he treasur all hi greatest
wonder
for two whole hour an aquat armi escort the nautilu dure
their game their bound while rival each other in beauti
bright and veloc i distinguish the green labr the band
mullet mark by a doubl line of black the roundtail gobi of a
white colour with violet spot on the back the japanes scombru a

our imagin wa kept at it height interject follow quickli
on each other ned name the fish and conseil class them i wa in
ecstasi with the vivac of their movement and the beauti of their

and at liberti in their natur element i will not mention all the
varieti which pass befor my dazzl ey all the collect of
the sea of china and japan these fish more numer than the bird
of the air came attract no doubt by the brilliant focu of the
electr light
suddenli there wa daylight in the saloon the iron panel close
again and the enchant vision disappear but for a long time i
dreamt on till my ey fell on the instrument hang on the
partit the compass still show the cours to be en the
manomet indic a pressur of five atmospher equival to a
depth of twentyf fathom and the electr log gave a speed of
fifteen mile an hour i expect captain nemo but he did not appear
the clock mark the hour of five
ned land and conseil return to their cabin and i retir to my
chamber my dinner wa readi it wa compos of turtl soup made of
the most delic hawksbil of a surmullet serv with puff past

fillet of the emperorholocanthu the savour of which seem to me
superior even to salmon
i pass the even read write and think then sleep
overpow me and i stretch myself on my couch of zostera and
slept profoundli whilst the nautilu wa glide rapidli through the
current of the black river

a note of invit
the next dai wa the 9th of novemb i awok after a long sleep of
twelv hour conseil came accord to custom to know how i had
pass the night and to offer hi servic he had left hi friend
the canadian sleep like a man who had never done anyth els all
hi life i let the worthi fellow chatter as he pleas without care
to answer him i wa preoccupi by the absenc of the captain dure
our sit of the dai befor and hope to see him todai
as soon as i wa dress i went into the saloon it wa desert
i plung into the studi of the shell treasur hidden behind the
glass i revel also in great herbal fill with the rarest marin
plant which although dri up retain their love colour
amongst these preciou hydrophyt i remark some vorticel
pavonari delic cerami with scarlet tint some fanshap agari
and some natabuli like flat mushroom which at on time us to be
class as zoophyt in short a perfect seri of alg
the whole dai pass without my be honour by a visit from captain
nemo the panel of the saloon did not open perhap thei did not wish
us to tire of these beauti thing
the cours of the nautilu wa en her speed twelv knot the
depth below the surfac between twentyf and thirti fathom
the next dai 10th of novemb the same desert the same solitud
i did not see on of the ship crew ned and conseil spent the greater
part of the dai with me thei were astonish at the inexplic
absenc of the captain wa thi singular man illhad he alter hi
intent with regard to us
after all as conseil said we enjoi perfect liberti we were
delic and abundantli fed our host kept to hi term of the
treati we could not complain and inde the singular of our fate
reserv such wonder compens for us that we had no right to
accus it as yet
that dai i commenc the journal of these adventur which ha enabl
me to relat them with more scrupul exactitud and minut detail i
wrote it on paper made from the zostera marina
11th novemb earli in the morn the fresh air spread over the
interior of the nautilu told me that we had come to the surfac of
the ocean to renew our suppli of oxygen i direct my step to the
central staircas and mount the platform
it wa six oclock the weather wa cloudi the sea grei but calm
scarc a billow captain nemo whom i hope to meet would he be
there i saw no on but the steersman imprison in hi glass cage
seat upon the project form by the hull of the pinnac i inhal
the salt breez with delight
by degre the fog disappear under the action of the sun rai the
radiant orb rose from behind the eastern horizon the sea flame under
it glanc like a train of gunpowd the cloud scatter in the
height were colour with live tint of beauti shade and
numer mare tail which betoken wind for that dai but what
wa wind to thi nautilu which tempest could not frighten
i wa admir thi joyou rise of the sun so gai and so
lifegiv when i heard step approach the platform i wa prepar
to salut captain nemo but it wa hi second whom i had alreadi seen
on the captain first visit who appear he advanc on the
platform not seem to see me with hi power glass to hi ey he
scan everi point of the horizon with great attent thi
examin over he approach the panel and pronounc a sentenc in
exactli these term i have rememb it for everi morn it wa
repeat under exactli the same condit it wa thu word
nautron respoc lorni virch
what it meant i could not sai
these word pronounc the second descend i thought that the
nautilu wa about to return to it submarin navig i regain
the panel and return to my chamber
five dai sped thu without ani chang in our situat everi morn
i mount the platform the same phrase wa pronounc by the same
individu but captain nemo did not appear
i had made up my mind that i should never see him again when on the
16th novemb on return to my room with ned and conseil i found
upon my tabl a note address to me i open it impati it wa
written in a bold clear hand the charact rather point recal
the german type the note wa word as follow
16th of novemb 1867
to professor aronnax on board the nautilu
captain nemo invit professor aronnax to a huntingparti which will
take place tomorrow morn in the forest of the island of crespo he
hope that noth will prevent the professor from be present and
he will with pleasur see him join by hi companion
captain nemo command of the nautilu
a hunt exclaim ned
and in the forest of the island of crespo ad conseil
oh then the gentleman is go on terra firma repli ned land
that seem to me to be clearli indic said i read the letter
onc more
well we must accept said the canadian but onc more on dry
ground we shall know what to do inde i shall not be sorri to eat a
piec of fresh venison
without seek to reconcil what wa contradictori between captain
nemo manifest avers to island and contin and hi invit
to hunt in a forest i content myself with repli
let us first see where the island of crespo is
i consult the planispher and in 32 40 north lat and 157 50
west long i found a small island recognis in 1801 by captain
crespo and mark in the ancient spanish map as rocca de la plata
the mean of which is the silver rock we were then about eighteen
hundr mile from our startingpoint and the cours of the
nautilu a littl chang wa bring it back toward the
southeast
i show thi littl rock lost in the midst of the north pacif to my
companion
if captain nemo doe sometim go on dry ground said i he at least
choos desert island
ned land shrug hi shoulder without speak and conseil and he
left me
after supper which wa serv by the steward mute and impass i
went to bed not without some anxieti
the next morn the 17th of novemb on awaken i felt that the
nautilu wa perfectli still i dress quickli and enter the
saloon
captain nemo wa there wait for me he rose bow and ask me if
it wa conveni for me to accompani him as he made no allus to
hi absenc dure the last eight dai i did not mention it and
simpli answer that my companion and myself were readi to follow him
we enter the diningroom where breakfast wa serv
m aronnax said the captain prai share my breakfast without
ceremoni we will chat as we eat for though i promis you a walk in
the forest i did not undertak to find hotel there so breakfast as a
man who will most like not have hi dinner till veri late
i did honour to the repast it wa compos of sever kind of fish
and slice of holothurid excel zoophyt and differ sort of
seawe our drink consist of pure water to which the captain ad
some drop of a ferment liquor extract by the kamschatcha method
from a seawe known under the name of rhodomenia palmata captain
nemo at at first without sai a word then he began
sir when i propos to you to hunt in my submarin forest of crespo
you evid thought me mad sir you should never judg lightli of
ani man
but captain believ me
be kind enough to listen and you will then see whether you have ani
caus to accus me of folli and contradict
i listen
you know as well as i do professor that man can live under water
provid he carri with him a suffici suppli of breathabl air in
submarin work the workman clad in an impervi dress with hi
head in a metal helmet receiv air from abov by mean of forc
pump and regul
that is a dive apparatu said i
just so but under these condit the man is not at liberti he is
attach to the pump which send him air through an indiarubb tube
and if we were oblig to be thu held to the nautilu we could not
go far
and the mean of get free i ask
it is to us the rouquayrol apparatu invent by two of your own
countrymen which i have brought to perfect for my own us and
which will allow you to risk yourself under these new physiolog
condit without ani organ whatev suffer it consist of a
reservoir of thick iron plate in which i store the air under a
pressur of fifti atmospher thi reservoir is fix on the back by
mean of brace like a soldier knapsack it upper part form a box
in which the air is kept by mean of a bellow and therefor cannot
escap unless at it normal tension in the rouquayrol apparatu such
as we us two indiarubb pipe leav thi box and join a sort of
tent which hold the nose and mouth on is to introduc fresh air the
other to let out the foul and the tongu close on or the other
accord to the want of the respir but i in encount great
pressur at the bottom of the sea wa oblig to shut my head like
that of a diver in a ball of copper and it is to thi ball of copper
that the two pipe the inspir and the expir open
perfectli captain nemo but the air that you carri with you must soon
be us when it onli contain fifteen per cent of oxygen it is no
longer fit to breath
right but i told you m aronnax that the pump of the nautilu
allow me to store the air under consider pressur and on those
condit the reservoir of the apparatu can furnish breathabl air
for nine or ten hour
i have no further object to make i answer i will onli ask
you on thing captainhow can you light your road at the bottom of the
sea
with the ruhmkorff apparatu m aronnax on is carri on the back
the other is fasten to the waist it is compos of a bunsen pile
which i do not work with bichrom of potash but with sodium a wire
is introduc which collect the electr produc and direct it
toward a particularli made lantern in thi lantern is a spiral glass
which contain a small quantiti of carbon ga when the apparatu is
at work thi ga becom lumin give out a white and continu
light thu provid i can breath and i can see
captain nemo to all my object you make such crush answer
that i dare no longer doubt but if i am forc to admit the rouquayrol
and ruhmkorff apparatu i must be allow some reserv with
regard to the gun i am to carri
but it is not a gun for powder answer the captain
then it is an airgun
doubtless how would you have me manufactur gunpowd on board
without either saltpetr sulphur or charcoal
besid i ad to fire under water in a medium eight hundr and
fiftyf time denser than the air we must conquer veri consider
resist
that would be no difficulti there exist gun accord to fulton
perfect in england by philip cole and burlei in franc by furci
and in itali by landi which ar furnish with a peculiar system of
close which can fire under these condit but i repeat have no
powder i us air under great pressur which the pump of the
nautilu furnish abundantli
but thi air must be rapidli us
well have i not my rouquayrol reservoir which can furnish it at
need a tap is all that is requir besid m aronnax you must see
yourself that dure our submarin hunt we can spend but littl air
and but few ball
but it seem to me that in thi twilight and in the midst of thi
fluid which is veri dens compar with the atmospher shot could
not go far nor easili prove mortal
sir on the contrari with thi gun everi blow is mortal and howev
lightli the anim is touch it fall as if struck by a thunderbolt
why
becaus the ball sent by thi gun ar not ordinari ball but littl
case of glass invent by leniebroek an austrian chemist of which
i have a larg suppli these glass case ar cover with a case of
steel and weight with a pellet of lead thei ar real leyden
bottl into which the electr is forc to a veri high tension
with the slightest shock thei ar discharg and the anim howev
strong it mai be fall dead i must tell you that these case ar size
number four and that the charg for an ordinari gun would be ten
i will argu no longer i repli rise from the tabl i have
noth left me but to take my gun at all event i will go where you
go
captain nemo then led me aft and in pass befor ned and conseil
cabin i call my two companion who follow immedi we then
came to a kind of cell near the machineryroom in which we were to put
on our walkingdress
chapter xv
a walk on the bottom of the sea
thi cell wa to speak correctli the arsen and wardrob of the
nautilu a dozen dive apparatus hung from the partit wait
our us
ned land on see them show evid repugn to dress himself in
on
but my worthi ned the forest of the island of crespo ar noth
but submarin forest
good said the disappoint harpoon who saw hi dream of fresh
meat fade awai and you m aronnax ar you go to dress yourself
in those cloth
there is no altern master ned
as you pleas sir repli the harpoon shrug hi shoulder
but as for me unless i am forc i will never get into on
no on will forc you master ned said captain nemo
is conseil go to risk it ask ned
i follow my master wherev he goe repli conseil
at the captain call two of the ship crew came to help us to dress
in these heavi and impervi cloth made of indiarubb without
seam and construct expressli to resist consider pressur on
would have thought it a suit of armour both suppl and resist thi
suit form trouser and waistcoat the trouser were finish off with
thick boot weight with heavi leaden sole the textur of the
waistcoat wa held togeth by band of copper which cross the
chest protect it from the great pressur of the water and leav
the lung free to act the sleev end in glove which in no wai
restrain the movement of the hand there wa a vast differ
notic between these consumm apparatus and the old cork
breastplat jacket and other contriv in vogu dure the
eighteenth centuri
captain nemo and on of hi companion a sort of hercul who must
have possess great strength conseil and myself were soon
envelop in the dress there remain noth more to be done but to
enclos our head in the metal box but befor proceed to thi
oper i ask the captain permiss to examin the gun we were
to carri
on of the nautilu men gave me a simpl gun the butt end of which
made of steel hollow in the centr wa rather larg it serv as a
reservoir for compress air which a valv work by a spring
allow to escap into a metal tube a box of projectil in a groov
in the thick of the butt end contain about twenti of these
electr ball which by mean of a spring were forc into the
barrel of the gun as soon as on shot wa fire anoth wa readi
captain nemo said i thi arm is perfect and easili handl i
onli ask to be allow to try it but how shall we gain the bottom of
the sea
at thi moment professor the nautilu is strand in five fathom
and we have noth to do but to start
but how shall we get off
you shall see
captain nemo thrust hi head into the helmet conseil and i did the
same not without hear an iron good sport from the canadian
the upper part of our dress termin in a copper collar upon which
wa screw the metal helmet three hole protect by thick glass
allow us to see in all direct by simpli turn our head in the
interior of the headdress as soon as it wa in posit the
rouquayrol apparatu on our back began to act and for my part i
could breath with eas
with the ruhmkorff lamp hang from my belt and the gun in my hand i
wa readi to set out but to speak the truth imprison in these heavi
garment and glu to the deck by my leaden sole it wa imposs
for me to take a step
illustr i wa readi to set out
but thi state of thing wa provid for i felt myself be push
into a littl room contigu to the wardroberoom my companion
follow tow along in the same wai i heard a watertight door
furnish with stopperpl close upon us and we were wrap in
profound dark
after some minut a loud hiss wa heard i felt the cold mount
from my feet to my chest evid from some part of the vessel thei
had by mean of a tap given entranc to the water which wa invad
us and with which the room wa soon fill a second door cut in the
side of the nautilu then open we saw a faint light in anoth
instant our feet trod the bottom of the sea
and now how can i retrac the impress left upon me by that walk
under the water word ar impot to relat such wonder captain
nemo walk in front hi companion follow some step behind conseil
and i remain near each other as if an exchang of word had been
possibl through our metal case i no longer felt the weight of my
cloth or of my shoe of my reservoir of air or my thick helmet
in the midst of which my head rattl like an almond in it shell
the light which lit the soil thirti feet below the surfac of the
ocean astonish me by it power the solar rai shone through the
wateri mass easili and dissip all colour and i clearli
distinguish object at a distanc of a hundr and fifti yard
beyond that the tint darken into fine gradat of ultramarin and
fade into vagu obscur truli thi water which surround me wa
but anoth air denser than the terrestri atmospher but almost as
transpar abov me wa the calm surfac of the sea
we were walk on fine even sand not wrinkl as on a flat shore
which retain the impress of the billow thi dazzl carpet
realli a reflector repel the rai of the sun with wonder
intens which account for the vibrat which penetr everi
atom of liquid shall i be believ when i sai that at the depth of
thirti feet i could see as if i wa in broad daylight
for a quarter of an hour i trod on thi sand sown with the impalp
dust of shell the hull of the nautilu resembl a long shoal
disappear by degre but it lantern when dark should overtak
us in the water would help to guid us on board by it distinct rai
soon form of object outlin in the distanc were discern i
recognis magnific rock hung with a tapestri of zoophyt of the
most beauti kind and i wa at first struck by the peculiar effect
of thi medium
it wa then ten in the morn the rai of the sun struck the surfac
of the wave at rather an obliqu angl and at the touch of their
light decompos by refract as through a prism flower rock
plant shell and polypi were shade at the edg by the seven solar
colour it wa marvel a feast for the ey thi complic of
colour tint a perfect kaleidoscop of green yellow orang
violet indigo and blue in on word the whole palett of an
enthusiast colourist why could i not commun to conseil the
live sensat which were mount to my brain and rival him in
express of admir for aught i knew captain nemo and hi
companion might be abl to exchang thought by mean of sign
previous agre upon so for want of better i talk to myself i
declaim in the copper box which cover my head therebi expend
more air in vain word than wa perhap expedi
variou kind of isi cluster of pure tuftcor prickli fungi and
anemon form a brilliant garden of flower enamel with porphit
deck with their collarett of blue tentacl seastar stud the
sandi bottom togeth with asterophyton like fine lace embroid by
the hand of naad whose festoon were wave by the gentl
undul caus by our walk it wa a real grief to me to crush
under my feet the brilliant specimen of mollusc which strew the
ground by thousand of hammerhead donacia verit bound
shell of staircas and red helmetshel angelw and mani
other produc by thi inexhaust ocean but we were bound to walk
so we went on whilst abov our head wave shoal of physalid
leav their tentacl to float in their train medu whose umbrella
of opal or rosepink escallop with a band of blue shelter us from
the rai of the sun and fieri pelagi which in the dark would
have strewn our path with phosphoresc light
all these wonder i saw in the space of a quarter of a mile scarc
stop and follow captain nemo who beckon me on by sign soon
the natur of the soil chang to the sandi plain succeed an extent
of slimi mud which the american call ooz compos of equal part
of silici and calcar shell we then travel over a plain of
seawe of wild and luxuri veget thi sward wa of close
textur and soft to the feet and rival the softest carpet woven by
the hand of man but whilst verdur wa spread at our feet it did not
abandon our head a light network of marin plant of that
inexhaust famili of seawe of which more than two thousand kind
ar known grew on the surfac of the water i saw long ribbon of
fucu float some globular other tuber laurenc and
cladostephi of most delic foliag and some rhodomeni palmat
resembl the fan of a cactu i notic that the green plant kept
nearer the top of the sea whilst the red were at a greater depth
leav to the black or brown hydrophyt the care of form garden
and parterr in the remot bed of the ocean
we had quit the nautilu about an hour and a half it wa near
noon i knew by the perpendicular of the sun rai which were no
longer refract the magic colour disappear by degre and the
shade of emerald and sapphir were effac we walk with a regular
step which rang upon the ground with astonish intens the
slightest nois wa transmit with a quick to which the ear is
unaccustom on the earth inde water is a better conductor of sound
than air in the ratio of four to on at thi period the earth slope
downward the light took a uniform tint we were at a depth of a
hundr and five yard and twenti inch undergo a pressur of six
atmospher
at thi depth i could still see the rai of the sun though feebli to
their intens brillianc had succeed a reddish twilight the lowest
state between dai and night but we could still see well enough it wa
not necessari to resort to the ruhmkorff apparatu as yet at thi
moment captain nemo stop he wait till i join him and then
point to an obscur mass loom in the shadow at a short distanc
it is the forest of the island of crespo thought iand i wa not
mistaken
chapter xvi
a submarin forest
we had at last arriv on the border of thi forest doubtless on of
the finest of captain nemo immens domain he look upon it as hi
own and consid he had the same right over it that the first men
had in the first dai of the world and inde who would have
disput with him the possess of thi submarin properti what other
hardier pioneer would come hatchet in hand to cut down the dark

thi forest wa compos of larg treeplant and the moment we
penetr under it vast arcad i wa struck by the singular
posit of their branchesa posit i had not yet observ
not a herb which carpet the ground not a branch which cloth the
tree wa either broken or bent nor did thei extend horizont all
stretch up to the surfac of the ocean not a filament not a ribbon
howev thin thei might be but kept as straight as a rod of iron the
fuci and lliana grew in rigid perpendicular line due to the densiti
of the element which had produc them motionless yet when bent to
on side by the hand thei directli resum their former posit
truli it wa the region of perpendicular
i soon accustom myself to thi fantast posit as well as to the
compar dark which surround us the soil of the forest seem
cover with sharp block difficult to avoid the submarin flora
struck me as be veri perfect and richer even than it would have
been in the arctic or tropic zone where these product ar not
so plenti but for some minut i involuntarili confound the
genera take zoophyt for hydrophyt anim for plant and who
would not have been mistaken the fauna and the flora ar too close
alli in thi submarin world
these plant ar selfpropag and the principl of their exist
is in the water which uphold and nourish them the greater number
instead of leav shot forth blade of caprici shape compris
within a scale of colourspink carmin green oliv fawn and
brown i saw there but not dri up as our specimen of the
nautilu ar pavonari spread like a fan as if to catch the breez
scarlet cerami whose laminari extend their edibl shoot of
fernshap nereocysti which grow to a height of fifteen feet
cluster of acetabuli whose stem increas in size upward and
number of other marin plant all devoid of flower
curiou anomali fantast element said an ingeni naturalist in
which the anim kingdom blossom and the veget doe not
under these numer shrub as larg as tree of the temper zone
and under their damp shadow were mass togeth real bush of live
flower hedg of zoophyt on which blossom some zebrameandrin
with crook groov some yellow caryophylli and to complet the
allus the fishfli flew from branch to branch like a swarm of
hummingbird whilst yellow lepisacomthi with bristl jaw
dactylopteri and monocentrid rose at our feet like a flight of
snipe
in about an hour captain nemo gave the signal to halt i for my part
wa not sorri and we stretch ourselv under an arbour of alari
the long thin blade of which stood up like arrow
thi short rest seem delici to me there wa noth want but
the charm of convers but imposs to speak imposs to
answer i onli put my great copper head to conseil i saw the worthi
fellow ey glisten with delight and to show hi satisfact he
shook himself in hi breastplat of air in the most comic wai in the
world
after four hour of thi walk i wa surpris not to find myself
dreadfulli hungri how to account for thi state of the stomach i could
not tell but instead i felt an insurmount desir to sleep which
happen to all diver and my ey soon close behind the thick
glass and i fell into a heavi slumber which the movement alon had
prevent befor captain nemo and hi robust companion stretch in
the clear crystal set us the exampl
how long i remain buri in thi drowsi i cannot judg but when
i woke the sun seem sink toward the horizon captain nemo had
alreadi risen and i wa begin to stretch my limb when an
unexpect apparit brought me briskli to my feet
a few step off a monstrou seaspid about thirtyeight inch
high wa watch me with squint ey readi to spring upon me
though my diver dress wa thick enough to defend me from the bite of
thi anim i could not help shudder with horror conseil and the
sailor of the nautilu awok at thi moment captain nemo point out
the hideou crustacean which a blow from the butt end of the gun
knock over and i saw the horribl claw of the monster writh in
terribl convuls thi accid remind me that other anim more
to be fear might haunt these obscur depth against whose attack my
divingdress would not protect me i had never thought of it befor
but i now resolv to be upon my guard inde i thought that thi
halt would mark the termin of our walk but i wa mistaken for
instead of return to the nautilu captain nemo continu hi bold
excurs the ground wa still on the inclin it decliv seem to
be get greater and to be lead us to greater depth it must
have been about three oclock when we reach a narrow vallei between
high perpendicular wall situat about seventyf fathom deep
thank to the perfect of our apparatu we were fortyf fathom
below the limit which natur seem to have impos on man as to hi
submarin excurs
i sai seventyf fathom though i had no instrument by which to
judg the distanc but i knew that even in the clearest water the
solar rai could not penetr further and accordingli the dark
deepen at ten pace not an object wa visibl i wa grope my wai
when i suddenli saw a brilliant white light captain nemo had just put
hi electr apparatu into us hi companion did the same and
conseil and i follow their exampl by turn a screw i establish
a commun between the wire and the spiral glass and the sea lit
by our four lantern wa illumin for a circl of thirtysix yard
captain nemo wa still plung into the dark depth of the forest
whose tree were get scarcer at everi step i notic that
veget life disappear sooner than anim life the medu had
alreadi abandon the arid soil from which a great number of anim
zoophyt articulata mollusc and fish still obtain susten
as we walk i thought the light of our ruhmkorff apparatu could not
fail to draw some inhabit from it dark couch but if thei did
approach us thei at least kept at a respect distanc from the
hunter sever time i saw captain nemo stop put hi gun to hi
shoulder and after some moment drop it and walk on at last after
about four hour thi marvel excurs came to an end a wall of
superb rock in an impos mass rose befor us a heap of gigant
block an enorm steep granit shore form dark grotto but
which present no practic slope it wa the prop of the island of
crespo it wa the earth captain nemo stop suddenli a gestur of
hi brought us all to a halt and howev desir i might be to scale
the wall i wa oblig to stop here end captain nemo domain and
he would not go beyond them further on wa a portion of the globe he
might not trampl upon
the return began captain nemo had return to the head of hi littl
band direct their cours without hesit i thought we were not
follow the same road to return to the nautilu the new road wa
veri steep and consequ veri pain we approach the surfac of
the sea rapidli but thi return to the upper strata wa not so sudden
as to caus relief from the pressur too rapidli which might have
produc seriou disord in our organis and brought on intern
lesion so fatal to diver veri soon light reappear and grew and
the sun be low on the horizon the refract edg the differ
object with a spectral ring at ten yard and a half deep we walk
amidst a shoal of littl fish of all kind more numer than the
bird of the air and also more agil but no aquat game worthi of a
shot had as yet met our gaze when at that moment i saw the captain
shoulder hi gun quickli and follow a move object into the shrub
he firedi heard a slight hiss and a creatur fell stun at some
distanc from us it wa a magnific seaotter an enhydru the onli
exclus marin quadrup thi otter wa five feet long and must
have been veri valuabl it skin chestnutbrown abov and silveri
underneath would have made on of those beauti fur so sought after
in the russian and chines market the fine and the lustr of it
coat would certainli fetch 80 i admir thi curiou mammal with it
round head ornament with short ear it round ey and white
whisker like those of a cat with web feet and nail and tuft
tail thi preciou anim hunt and track by fishermen ha now
becom veri rare and taken refug chiefli in the northern part of the
pacif or probabl it race would soon becom extinct
captain nemo companion took the beast threw it over hi shoulder
and we continu our journei for on hour a plain of sand lai
stretch befor us sometim it rose to within two yard and some
inch of the surfac of the water i then saw our imag clearli
reflect drawn invers and abov us appear an ident group
reflect our movement and our action in a word like us in everi
point except that thei walk with their head downward and their feet
in the air
anoth effect i notic which wa the passag of thick cloud which
form and vanish rapidli but on reflect i understood that these
seem cloud were due to the vari thick of the reed at the
bottom and i could even see the fleeci foam which their broken top
multipli on the water and the shadow of larg bird pass abov
our head whose rapid flight i could discern on the surfac of the
sea
on thi occas i wa wit to on of the finest gunshot which
ever made the nerv of a hunter thrill a larg bird of great breadth
of wing clearli visibl approach hover over us captain nemo
companion shoulder hi gun and fire when it wa onli a few yard
abov the wave the creatur fell stun and the forc of it fall
brought it within the reach of dexter hunter grasp it wa an
albatross of the finest kind
our march had not been interrupt by thi incid for two hour we
follow these sandi plain then field of alg veri disagre to
cross candidli i could do no more when i saw a glimmer of light
which for a half mile broke the dark of the water it wa the
lantern of the nautilu befor twenti minut were over we should be
on board and i should be abl to breath with eas for it seem that
my reservoir suppli air veri defici in oxygen but i did not
reckon on an accident meet which delai our arriv for some
time
i had remain some step behind when i present saw captain nemo
come hurriedli toward me with hi strong hand he bent me to the
ground hi companion do the same to conseil at first i knew not
what to think of thi sudden attack but i wa soon reassur by see
the captain lie down besid me and remain immov
i wa stretch on the ground just under the shelter of a bush of
alg when rais my head i saw some enorm mass cast
phosphoresc gleam pass blusteringli by
my blood froze in my vein as i recognis two formid shark which
threaten us it wa a coupl of tintorea terribl creatur with
enorm tail and a dull glassi stare the phosphoresc matter
eject from hole pierc around the muzzl monstrou brute which
would crush a whole man in their iron jaw i did not know whether
conseil stop to classifi them for my part i notic their silver
belli and their huge mouth bristl with teeth from a veri
unscientif point of view and more as a possibl victim than as a
naturalist
happili the voraci creatur do not see well thei pass without
see us brush us with their brownish fin and we escap by a
miracl from a danger certainli greater than meet a tiger fullfac
in the forest half an hour after guid by the electr light we
reach the nautilu the outsid door had been left open and
captain nemo close it as soon as we had enter the first cell he
then press a knob i heard the pump work in the midst of the
vessel i felt the water sink from around me and in a few moment
the cell wa entir empti the insid door then open and we
enter the vestri
there our divingdress wa taken off not without some troubl and
fairli worn out from want of food and sleep i return to my room in
great wonder at thi surpris excurs at the bottom of the sea
chapter xvii
four thousand leagu under the pacif
the next morn the 18th of novemb i had quit recov from my
fatigu of the dai befor and i went up on to the platform just as
the second lieuten wa utter hi daili phrase
i wa admir the magnific aspect of the ocean when captain nemo
appear he did not seem to be awar of my presenc and began a
seri of astronom observ then when he had finish he
went and leant on the cage of the watchlight and gaze abstractedli
on the ocean in the meantim a number of the sailor of the
nautilu all strong and healthi men had come up onto the platform
thei came to draw up the net that had been laid all night these
sailor were evid of differ nation although the european type
wa visibl in all of them i recognis some unmistak irishmen
frenchmen some sclave and a greek or a candiot thei were civil
and onli us that odd languag among themselv the origin of which i
could not guess neither could i question them
the net were haul in thei were a larg kind of chalut like
those on the normandi coast great pocket that the wave and a chain
fix in the smaller mesh kept open these pocket drawn by iron
pole swept through the water and gather in everyth in their
wai that dai thei brought up curiou specimen from those product
coast
i reckon that the haul had brought in more than nine hundredweight of
fish it wa a fine haul but not to be wonder at inde the net
ar let down for sever hour and enclos in their mesh an infinit
varieti we had no lack of excel food and the rapid of the
nautilu and the attract of the electr light could alwai renew
our suppli these sever product of the sea were immedi
lower through the panel to the steward room some to be eaten
fresh and other pickl
the fish end the provis of air renew i thought that the
nautilu wa about to continu it submarin excurs and wa
prepar to return to my room when without further preambl the
captain turn to me sai
professor is not thi ocean gift with real life it ha it temper
and it gentl mood yesterdai it slept as we did and now it ha woke
after a quiet night look he continu it wake under the caress
of the sun it is go to renew it diurnal exist it is an
interest studi to watch the plai of it organis it ha a
puls arteri spasm and i agre with the learn mauri who
discov in it a circul as real as the circul of blood in
anim
ye the ocean ha inde circul and to promot it the creator
ha caus thing to multipli in itcalor salt and animalcula
when captain nemo spoke thu he seem altogeth chang and arous
an extraordinari emot in me
also he ad true exist is there and i can imagin the
foundat of nautic town cluster of submarin hous which
like the nautilu would ascend everi morn to breath at the
surfac of the water free town independ citi yet who know
whether some despot
captain nemo finish hi sentenc with a violent gestur then
address me as if to chase awai some sorrow thought
m aronnax he ask do you know the depth of the ocean
i onli know captain what the princip sound have taught us
could you tell me them so that i can suit them to my purpos
these ar some i repli that i rememb if i am not mistaken a
depth of 8000 yard ha been found in the north atlant and 2500
yard in the mediterranean the most remark sound have been
made in the south atlant near the thirtyfifth parallel and thei
gave 12000 yard 14000 yard and 15000 yard to sum up all it is
reckon that if the bottom of the sea were level it mean depth
would be about on and threequart leagu
well professor repli the captain we shall show you better than
that i hope as to the mean depth of thi part of the pacif i tell
you it is onli 4000 yard
have said thi captain nemo went toward the panel and disappear
down the ladder i follow him and went into the larg drawingroom
the screw wa immedi put in motion and the log gave twenti mile
an hour
dure the dai and week that pass captain nemo wa veri spare of
hi visit i seldom saw him the lieuten prick the ship cours
regularli on the chart so i could alwai tell exactli the rout of the
nautilu
nearli everi dai for some time the panel of the drawingroom were
open and we were never tire of penetr the mysteri of the
submarin world
the gener direct of the nautilu wa southeast and it kept
between 100 and 150 yard of depth on dai howev i do not know
why be drawn diagon by mean of the inclin plane it touch
the bed of the sea the thermomet indic a temperatur of 425
cent a temperatur that at thi depth seem common to all
latitud
at three oclock in the morn of the 26th of novemb the nautilu
cross the tropic of cancer at 172 long on 27th instant it sight
the sandwich island where cook di februari 14 1779 we had then
gone 4860 leagu from our startingpoint in the morn when i went
on the platform i saw two mile to windward hawaii the largest of
the seven island that form the group i saw clearli the cultiv
rang and the sever mountainchain that run parallel with the
side and the volcano that overtop mounarea which rise 5000 yard
abov the level of the sea besid other thing the net brought up
were sever flabellaria and grace polypi that ar peculiar to
that part of the ocean the direct of the nautilu wa still to
the southeast it cross the equat decemb 1 in 142 long and
on the 4th of the same month after cross rapidli and without
anyth in particular occur we sight the marquesa group i
saw three mile off martin peak in noukahiva the largest of the
group that belong to franc i onli saw the woodi mountain against
the horizon becaus captain nemo did not wish to bring the ship to the
wind there the net brought up beauti specimen of fish some with
azur fin and tail like gold the flesh of which is unrival some
nearli destitut of scale but of exquisit flavour other with boni
jaw and yellowting gill as good as bonito all fish that would
be of us to us after leav these charm island protect by the
french flag from the 4th to the 11th of decemb the nautilu sail
over about 2000 mile
dure the daytim of the 11th of decemb i wa busi read in the
larg drawingroom ned land and conseil watch the lumin water
through the halfopen panel the nautilu wa immov while it
reservoir were fill it kept at a depth of 1000 yard a region
rare visit in the ocean and in which larg fish were seldom seen
i wa then read a charm book by jean mace the slave of the
stomach and i wa learn some valuabl lesson from it when conseil
interrupt me
will master come here a moment he said in a curiou voic
what is the matter conseil
i want master to look
i rose went and lean on my elbow befor the pane and watch
in a full electr light an enorm black mass quit immov wa
suspend in the midst of the water i watch it attent seek
to find out the natur of thi gigant cetacean but a sudden thought
cross my mind a vessel i said half aloud
ye repli the canadian a disabl ship that ha sunk
perpendicularli
ned land wa right we were close to a vessel of which the tatter
shroud still hung from their chain the keel seem to be in good
order and it had been wreck at most some few hour three stump of
mast broken off about two feet abov the bridg show that the
vessel had had to sacrific it mast but ly on it side it had
fill and it wa heel over to port thi skeleton of what it had
onc been wa a sad spectacl as it lai lost under the wave but
sadder still wa the sight of the bridg where some corps bound
with rope were still ly i count fivefour men on of whom wa
stand at the helm and a woman stand by the poop hold an
infant in her arm she wa quit young i could distinguish her
featur which the water had not decompos by the brilliant light
from the nautilu in on despair effort she had rais her
infant abov her headpoor littl thingwhos arm encircl it
mother neck the attitud of the four sailor wa fright
distort as thei were by their convuls movement whilst make a
last effort to free themselv from the cord that bound them to the
vessel the steersman alon calm with a grave clear face hi grei
hair glu to hi forehead and hi hand clutch the wheel of the
helm seem even then to be guid the three broken mast through the
depth of the ocean
what a scene we were dumb our heart beat fast befor thi shipwreck
taken as it were from life and photograph in it last moment and i
saw alreadi come toward it with hungri ey enorm shark
attract by the human flesh
howev the nautilu turn went round the submerg vessel and
in on instant i read on the sternth florida sunderland
chapter xviii
vanikoro
thi terribl spectacl wa the forerunn of the seri of maritim
catastroph that the nautilu wa destin to meet with in it
rout as long as it went through more frequent water we often saw
the hull of shipwreck vessel that were rot in the depth and
deeper down cannon bullet anchor chain and a thousand other
iron materi eaten up by rust howev on the 11th of decemb we
sight the pomot island the old danger group of bougainvil
that extend over a space of 500 leagu at es to wnw from the
island duci to that of lazareff thi group cover an area of 370
squar leagu and it is form of sixti group of island among
which the gambier group is remark over which franc exercis
swai these ar coral island slowli rais but continu creat
by the daili work of polypi then thi new island will be join later
on to the neighbor group and a fifth contin will stretch from
new zealand and new caledonia and from thenc to the marquesa
on dai when i wa suggest thi theori to captain nemo he repli
coldli
the earth doe not want new contin but new men
chanc had conduct the nautilu toward the island of
clermonttonner on of the most curiou of the group that wa
discov in 1822 by captain bell of the minerva i could studi now
the madrepor system to which ar due the island in thi ocean
madrepor which must not be mistaken for coral have a tissu line
with a calcar crust and the modif of it structur have
induc m miln edward my worthi master to class them into five
section the animalcul that the marin polypu secret live by
million at the bottom of their cell their calcar deposit becom
rock reef and larg and small island here thei form a ring
surround a littl inland lake that commun with the sea by
mean of gap there thei make barrier of reef like those on the
coast of new caledonia and the variou pomoton island in other
place like those at reunion and at mauric thei rais fring reef
high straight wall near which the depth of the ocean is
consider
some cablelength off the shore of the island of clermont i admir
the gigant work accomplish by these microscop worker these
wall ar special the work of those madrepor known as millepora
porit madrepor and astraea these polypi ar found particularli
in the rough bed of the sea near the surfac and consequ it is
from the upper part that thei begin their oper in which thei
buri themselv by degre with the debri of the secret that
support them such is at least darwin theori who thu explain the
format of the atol a superior theori to my mind to that given
of the foundat of the madrepor work summit of mountain or
volcano that ar submerg some feet below the level of the sea
i could observ close these curiou wall for perpendicularli thei
were more than 300 yard deep and our electr sheet light up thi
calcar matter brilliantli repli to a question conseil ask me
as to the time these coloss barrier took to be rais i astonish
him much by tell him that learn men reckon it about the eighth
of an inch in a hundr year
toward even clermonttonnerr wa lost in the distanc and the
rout of the nautilu wa sensibl chang after have cross the
tropic of capricorn in 135 longitud it sail wnw make again
for the tropic zone although the summer sun wa veri strong we did
not suffer from heat for at fifteen or twenti fathom below the
surfac the temperatur did not rise abov from ten to twelv degre
on 15th of decemb we left to the east the bewitch group of the
societi and the grace tahiti queen of the pacif i saw in the
morn some mile to the windward the elev summit of the
island these water furnish our tabl with excel fish mackerel
bonito and some varieti of a seaserp
on the 25th of decemb the nautilu sail into the midst of the new
hebrid discov by quiro in 1606 and that bougainvil explor
in 1768 and to which cook gave it present name in 1773 thi group is
compos princip of nine larg island that form a band of 120
leagu nn to ssw between 15 and 2 s lat and 164 deg and
168 long we pass toler near to the island of aurou that at
noon look like a mass of green wood surmount by a peak of great
height
that dai be christma dai ned land seem to regret sore the
noncelebr of christma the famili fete of which protest
ar so fond i had not seen captain nemo for a week when on the
morn of the 27th he came into the larg drawingroom alwai
seem as if he had seen you five minut befor i wa busili trace
the rout of the nautilu on the planispher the captain came up to
me put hi finger on on spot on the chart and said thi singl word
vanikoro
the effect wa magic it wa the name of the island on which la
perous had been lost i rose suddenli
the nautilu ha brought us to vanikoro i ask
ye professor said the captain
and i can visit the celebr island where the boussol and the
astrolab struck
if you like professor
when shall we be there
we ar there now
follow by captain nemo i went up on to the platform and greedili
scan the horizon
to the ne two volcan island emerg of unequ size surround by
a coral reef that measur forti mile in circumfer we were close
to vanikoro realli the on to which dumont durvil gave the name of
isl de la recherch and exactli face the littl harbour of vanou
situat in 16 4 s lat and 164 32 e long the earth seem
cover with verdur from the shore to the summit in the interior
that were crown by mount kapogo 476 feet high the nautilu
have pass the outer belt of rock by a narrow strait found itself
among breaker where the sea wa from thirti to forti fathom deep
under the verdant shade of some mangrov i perceiv some savag who
appear greatli surpris at our approach in the long black bodi
move between wind and water did thei not see some formid
cetacean that thei regard with suspicion
just then captain nemo ask me what i knew about the wreck of la
perous
onli what everyon know captain i repli
and could you tell me what everyon know about it he inquir
iron
easili
i relat to him all that the last work of dumont durvil had made
knownwork from which the follow is a brief account
la perous and hi second captain de langl were sent by loui xvi
in 1785 on a voyag of circumnavig thei embark in the
corvett boussol and the astrolab neither of which were again heard
of in 1791 the french govern justli uneasi as to the fate of
these two sloop man two larg merchantmen the recherch and the
esper which left brest the 28th of septemb under the command of
bruni dentrecasteaux
two month after thei learn from bowen command of the albemarl
that the debri of shipwreck vessel had been seen on the coast of
new georgia but dentrecasteaux ignor thi communicationrath
uncertain besidesdirect hi cours toward the admiralti island
mention in a report of captain hunter as be the place where la
perous wa wreck
thei sought in vain the esper and the recherch pass befor
vanikoro without stop there and in fact thi voyag wa most
disastr as it cost dentrecasteaux hi life and those of two of
hi lieuten besid sever of hi crew
captain dillon a shrewd old pacif sailor wa the first to find
unmistak trace of the wreck on the 15th of mai 1824 hi
vessel the st patrick pass close to tikopia on of the new
hebrid there a lascar came alongsid in a cano sold him the handl
of a sword in silver that bore the print of charact engrav on the
hilt the lascar pretend that six year befor dure a stai at
vanikoro he had seen two european that belong to some vessel that
had run aground on the reef some year ago
dillon guess that he meant la perous whose disappear had
troubl the whole world he tri to get on to vanikoro where
accord to the lascar he would find numer debri of the wreck
but wind and tide prevent him
dillon return to calcutta there he interest the asiat societi
and the indian compani in hi discoveri a vessel to which wa given
the name of the recherch wa put at hi dispos and he set out
23rd januari 1827 accompani by a french agent
the recherch after touch at sever point in the pacif cast
anchor befor vanikoro 7th juli 1827 in that same harbour of vanou
where the nautilu wa at thi time
there it collect numer relic of the wreckiron utensil anchor
pulleystrop swivelgun an 18 lb shot fragment of astronom
instrument a piec of crown work and a bronz clock bear thi
inscriptionbazin ma fait the mark of the foundri of the arsen at
brest about 1785 there could be no further doubt
dillon have made all inquiri stai in the unlucki place till
octob then he quit vanikoro and direct hi cours toward new
zealand put into calcutta 7th april 1828 and return to franc
where he wa warmli welcom by charl x
but at the same time without know dillon movement dumont
durvil had alreadi set out to find the scene of the wreck and thei
had learn from a whaler that some medal and a cross of st loui had
been found in the hand of some savag of louisiad and new caledonia
dumont durvil command of the astrolab had then sail and two
month after dillon had left vanikoro he put into hobart town there he
learn the result of dillon inquiri and found that a certain
jame hobb second lieuten of the union of calcutta after land
on an island situat 8 18 s lat and 156 30 e long had seen
some iron bar and red stuff us by the nativ of these part
dumont durvil much perplex and not know how to credit the
report of lowclass journal decid to follow dillon track
on the 10th of februari 1828 the astrolab appear off tikopia and
took as guid and interpret a desert found on the island made hi
wai to vanikoro sight it on the 12th inst lai among the reef
until the 14th and not until the 20th did he cast anchor within the
barrier in the harbour of vanou
on the 23rd sever offic went round the island and brought back
some unimport trifl the nativ adopt a system of denial and
evas refus to take them to the unlucki place thi ambigu
conduct led them to believ that the nativ had illtreat the
castawai and inde thei seem to fear that dumont durvil had
come to aveng la perous and hi unfortun crew
howev on the 26th appeas by some present and understand that
thei had no repris to fear thei led m jacquireot to the scene of
the wreck
there in three or four fathom of water between the reef of pacou
and vanou lai anchor cannon pig of lead and iron embed in the
limi concret the larg boat and the whaler belong to the
astrolab were sent to thi place and not without some difficulti
their crew haul up an anchor weigh 1800 lb a brass gun some
pig of iron and two copper swivelgun
dumont durvil question the nativ learn too that la perous
after lose both hi vessel on the reef of thi island had
construct a smaller boat onli to be lost a second time where no
on knew
but the french govern fear that dumont durvil wa not
acquaint with dillon movement had sent the sloop bayonnais
command by legoar de tromelin to vanikoro which had been
station on the west coast of america the bayonnais cast her anchor

chapter xix
torr strait
dure the night of the 27th or 28th of decemb the nautilu left
the shore of vanikoro with great speed her cours wa southwesterli
and in three dai she had gone over the 750 leagu that separ it
from la perous group and the southeast point of papua
earli on the 1st of januari 1863 conseil join me on the platform
master will you permit me to wish you a happi new year
what conseil exactli as if i wa at pari in my studi at the jardin
de plant well i accept your good wish and thank you for them
onli i will ask you what you mean by a happi new year under our
circumst do you mean the year that will bring us to the end of
our imprison or the year that see us continu thi strang
voyag
realli i do not know how to answer master we ar sure to see
curiou thing and for the last two month we have not had time for
dull the last marvel is alwai the most astonish and if we
continu thi progress i do not know how it will end it is my
opinion that we shall never again see the like i think then with no
offenc to master that a happi year would be on in which we could see
everyth
on 2nd januari we had made 11340 mile or 5250 french leagu sinc
our startingpoint in the japan sea befor the ship head stretch
the danger shore of the coral sea on the northeast coast of
australia our boat lai along some mile from the redoubt bank on
which cook vessel wa lost 10th june 1770 the boat in which cook
wa struck on a rock and if it did not sink it wa ow to a piec
of coral that wa broken by the shock and fix itself in the broken
keel
i had wish to visit the reef 360 leagu long against which the
sea alwai rough broke with great violenc with a nois like
thunder but just then the inclin plane drew the nautilu down to
a great depth and i could see noth of the high coral wall i had
to content myself with the differ specimen of fish brought up by
the net i remark among other some germon a speci of mackerel
as larg as a tunni with bluish side and stripe with transvers
band that disappear with the anim life
these fish follow us in shoal and furnish us with veri delic
food we took also a larg number of gilthead about on and a half
inch long tast like dori and fly pyrap like submarin
swallow which in dark night light altern the air and water
with their phosphoresc light among the mollusc and zoophyt i
found in the mesh of the net sever speci of alcyonarian echini
hammer spur dial cerit and hyallea the flora wa repres
by beauti float seawe laminaria and macrocyst
impregn with the mucilag that transud through their pore and
among which i gather an admir nemastoma geliniaroi that wa
class among the natur curios of the museum
two dai after cross the coral sea 4th januari we sight the
papuan coast on thi occas captain nemo inform me that hi
intent wa to get into the indian ocean by the strait of torr hi
commun end there
the torr strait ar nearli thirtyfour leagu wide but thei ar
obstruct by an innumer quantiti of island islet breaker and
rock that make it navig almost impractic so that captain
nemo took all need precaut to cross them the nautilu
float betwixt wind and water went at a moder pace her screw
like a cetacean tail beat the wave slowli
profit by thi i and my two companion went up on to the desert
platform befor us wa the steersman cage and i expect that
captain nemo wa there direct the cours of the nautilu i had
befor me the excel chart of the strait of torr and i
consult them attent round the nautilu the sea dash
furious the cours of the wave that went from southeast to
northwest at the rate of two and a half mile broke on the coral that
show itself here and there
thi is a bad sea remark ned land
detest inde and on that doe not suit a boat like the
nautilu
the captain must be veri sure of hi rout for i see there piec of
coral that would do for it keel if it onli touch them slightli
inde the situat wa danger but the nautilu seem to slide
like magic off these rock it did not follow the rout of the
astrolab and the zele exactli for thei prove fatal to dumont
durvil it bore more northward coast the island of murrai and
came back to the southwest toward cumberland passag i thought it
wa go to pass it by when go back to northwest it went
through a larg quantiti of island and islet littl known toward
the island sound and canal mauvai
i wonder if captain nemo foolishli imprud would steer hi vessel
into that pass where dumont durvil two corvett touch when
swerv again and cut straight through to the west he steer
for the island of gilboa
it wa then three in the afternoon the tide began to reced be
quit full the nautilu approach the island that i still saw
with it remark border of screwpin he stood off it at about two
mile distant suddenli a shock overthrew me the nautilu just
touch a rock and stai immov lai lightli to port side
when i rose i perceiv captain nemo and hi lieuten on the
platform thei were examin the situat of the vessel and
exchang word in their incomprehens dialect
she wa situat thu two mile on the starboard side appear
gilboa stretch from north to west like an immens arm toward the
south and east some coral show itself left by the ebb we had run
aground and in on of those sea where the tide ar middlinga sorri
matter for the float of the nautilu howev the vessel had not
suffer for her keel wa solidli join but if she could neither
glide off nor move she ran the risk of be for ever fasten to
these rock and then captain nemo submarin vessel would be done
for
i wa reflect thu when the captain cool and calm alwai master
of himself approach me
an accid i ask
no an incid
but an incid that will oblig you perhap to becom an inhabit
of thi land from which you flee
captain nemo look at me curious and made a neg gestur as
much as to sai that noth would forc him to set foot on terra firma
again then he said
besid m aronnax the nautilu is not lost it will carri you yet
into the midst of the marvel of the ocean our voyag is onli begun
and i do not wish to be depriv so soon of the honour of your
compani
howev captain nemo i repli without notic the iron turn
of hi phrase the nautilu ran aground in open sea now the tide
ar not strong in the pacif and if you cannot lighten the
nautilu i do not see how it will be reinflat
the tide ar not strong in the pacif you ar right there
professor but in torr strait on find still a differ of a yard
and a half between the level of high and low sea todai is 4th
januari and in five dai the moon will be full now i shall be veri
much astonish if that satellit doe not rais these mass of water
suffici and render me a servic that i should be indebt to her
for
have said thi captain nemo follow by hi lieuten redescend
to the interior of the nautilu as to the vessel it move not and
wa immov as if the corallin polypi had alreadi wall it up with
their in destruct cement
well sir said ned land who came up to me after the departur of
the captain
well friend ned we will wait patient for the tide on the 9th
instant for it appear that the moon will have the good to put it
off again
realli
realli
and thi captain is not go to cast anchor at all sinc the tide
will suffic said conseil simpli
the canadian look at conseil then shrug hi shoulder
sir you mai believ me when i tell you that thi piec of iron will
navig neither on nor under the sea again it is onli fit to be sold
for it weight i think therefor that the time ha come to part
compani with captain nemo
friend ned i do not despair of thi stout nautilu as you do and
in four dai we shall know what to hold to on the pacif tide
besid flight might be possibl if we were in sight of the english or
provenc coast but on the papuan shore it is anoth thing and it
will be time enough to come to that extrem if the nautilu doe
not recov itself again which i look upon as a grave event
but do thei know at least how to act circumspectli there is an
island on that island there ar tree under those tree terrestri
anim bearer of cutlet and roast beef to which i would willingli
give a trial
in thi friend ned is right said conseil and i agre with him
could not master obtain permiss from hi friend captain nemo to put
us on land if onli so as not to lose the habit of tread on the
solid part of our planet
i can ask him but he will refus
will master risk it ask conseil and we shall know how to reli
upon the captain amiabl
to my great surpris captain nemo gave me the permiss i ask for
and he gave it veri agreeabl without even exact from me a promis
to return to the vessel but flight across new guinea might be veri
peril and i should not have counsel ned land to attempt it
better to be a prison on board the nautilu than to fall into the
hand of the nativ
at eight oclock arm with gun and hatchet we got off the
nautilu the sea wa pretti calm a slight breez blew on land
conseil and i row we sped along quickli and ned steer in the
straight passag that the breaker left between them the boat wa well
handl and move rapidli
ned land could not restrain hi joi he wa like a prison that had
escap from prison and knew not that it wa necessari to reenter it
meat we ar go to eat some meat and what meat he repli real
game no bread inde
i do not sai that fish is not good we must not abus it but a piec
of fresh venison grill on live coal will agreeabl vari our
ordinari cours
glutton said conseil he make my mouth water
it remain to be seen i said if these forest ar full of game
and if the game is not such as will hunt the hunter himself
well said m aronnax repli the canadian whose teeth seem
sharpen like the edg of a hatchet but i will eat tigerloin of
tigerif there is no other quadrup on thi island
friend ned is uneasi about it said conseil
whatev it mai be continu ned land everi anim with four paw
without feather or with two paw without feather will be salut by
my first shot
veri well master land imprud ar begin
never fear m aronnax repli the canadian i do not want
twentyf minut to offer you a dish of my sort
at halfpast eight the nautilu boat ran softli aground on a heavi
sand after have happili pass the coral reef that surround the
island of gilboa
chapter xx
a few dai on land
i wa much impress on touch land ned land tri the soil with hi
feet as if to take possess of it howev it wa onli two month
befor that we had becom accord to captain nemo passeng on
board the nautilu but in realiti prison of it command
in a few minut we were within musketshot of the coast the whole
horizon wa hidden behind a beauti curtain of forest enorm
tree the trunk of which attain a height of 200 feet were ti to

vault grew orchid legumin plant and fern
but without notic all these beauti specimen of papuan flora
the canadian abandon the agreeabl for the us he discov a
cocotre beat down some of the fruit broke them and we drunk the
milk and at the nut with a satisfact that protest against the
ordinari food on the nautilu

so much the wors for him said conseil
and so much the better for us repli ned land there will be more
for us
on word onli master land i said to the harpoon who wa
begin to ravag anoth coconut tree coconut ar good thing
but befor fill the cano with them it would be wise to reconnoitr
and see if the island doe not produc some substanc not less us
fresh veget would be welcom on board the nautilu
master is right repli conseil and i propos to reserv three
place in our vessel on for fruit the other for veget and the
third for the venison of which i have not yet seen the smallest
specimen
conseil we must not despair said the canadian
let us continu i return and lie in wait although the island
seem uninhabit it might still contain some individu that would
be less hard than we on the natur of game
ho ho said ned land move hi jaw significantli

while we were talk thu we were penetr the sombr arch of
the forest and for two hour we survei it in all direct
chanc reward our search for eatabl veget and on of the most
us product of the tropic zone furnish us with preciou food
that we miss on board i would speak of the breadfruit tree veri
abund in the island of gilboa and i remark chiefli the varieti
destitut of seed which bear in malaya the name of rima
ned land knew these fruit well he had alreadi eaten mani dure hi
numer voyag and he knew how to prepar the eatabl substanc

and provid with a lentil he light a fire of dead wood that

fruit of the breadfruit some had not then attain a suffici
degre of matur and their thick skin cover a white but rather
fibrou pulp other the greater number yellow and gelatin wait

at last at five oclock in the even load with our rich we
quit the shore and half an hour after we hail the nautilu no

desert the provis embark i descend to my chamber and after
supper slept soundli
the next dai 6th januari noth new on board not a sound insid
not a sign of life the boat rest along the edg in the same place
in which we had left it we resolv to return to the island ned land
hope to be more fortun than on the dai befor with regard to the
hunt and wish to visit anoth part of the forest
at dawn we set off the boat carri on by the wave that flow to
shore reach the island in a few minut
we land and think that it wa better to give in to the canadian
we follow ned land whose long limb threaten to distanc us he
wound up the coast toward the west then ford some torrent he
gain the high plain that wa border with admir forest some
kingfish were rambl along the watercours but thei would not
let themselv be approach their circumspect prove to me that
these bird knew what to expect from bipe of our speci and i
conclud that if the island wa not inhabit at least human be
occasion frequent it
after cross a rather larg prairi we arriv at the skirt of a
littl wood that wa enliven by the song and flight of a larg
number of bird
there ar onli bird said conseil
but thei ar eatabl repli the harpoon
i do not agre with you friend ned for i see onli parrot there

inde under the thick foliag of thi wood a world of parrot were
fly from branch to branch onli need a care educ to speak
the human languag for the moment thei were chatter with parrot
of all colour and grave cockatoo who seem to medit upon some
philosoph problem whilst brilliant red lori pass like a piec
of bunt carri awai by the breez papuan with the finest azur
colour and in all a varieti of wing thing most charm to behold
but few eatabl
howev a bird peculiar to these land and which ha never pass the
limit of the arrow and papuan island wa want in thi collect
but fortun reserv it for me befor long

the malai who carri on a great trade in these bird with the chines
have sever mean that we could not emploi for take them sometim
thei put snare on the top of high tree that the bird of paradis
prefer to frequent sometim thei catch them with a viscou birdlim
that paralys their movement thei even go so far as to poison the
fountain that the bird gener drink from but we were oblig to
fire at them dure flight which gave us few chanc to bring them
down and inde we vainli exhaust on half our ammunit
about eleven oclock in the morn the first rang of mountain that
form the centr of the island wa travers and we had kill noth
hunger drove us on the hunter had reli on the product of the
chase and thei were wrong happili conseil to hi great surpris

that wa sensibl advic and wa follow out after walk for on
hour we had attain a forest of sagotre some inoffens serpent
glide awai from us the bird of paradis fled at our approach and
truli i despair of get near on when conseil who wa walk in

ah bravo conseil

live bird and carri it in your hand

effect of intemper

month you must need reproach me
howev i examin the curiou bird conseil wa right the bird

hardli walk
thi bird belong to the most beauti of the eight speci that ar

ah professor cri ned land who wa carri awai by the delight
of the chase what excel game and stew too what a suppli for
the nautilu two three five down and to think that we shall eat
that flesh and that the idiot on board shall not have a crumb
i think that in the excess of hi joi the canadian if he had not
talk so much would have kill them all but he content himself
with a singl dozen of these interest marsupian these anim were
small thei were a speci of those kangaroo rabbitss that live
habitu in the hollow of tree and whose speed is extrem but
thei ar moder fat and furnish at least estim food we were
veri satisfi with the result of the hunt happi ned propos to
return to thi enchant island the next dai for he wish to
depopul it of all the eatabl quadrup but he had reckon
without hi host
at six oclock in the even we had regain the shore our boat wa
moor to the usual place the nautilu like a long rock emerg

ned land had not wish to leav hi provis and in spite of hi
immin danger hi pig on on side and kangaroo on the other he
went toler fast in two minut we were on the shore to load the
boat with provis and arm to push it out to sea and ship the
oar wa the work of an instant we had not gone two cablelength
when a hundr savag howl and gesticul enter the water up
to their waist i watch to see if their apparit would attract
some men from the nautilu on to the platform but no the enorm
machin ly off wa absolut desert
twenti minut later we were on board the panel were open after
make the boat fast we enter into the interior of the nautilu
i descend to the drawingroom from whenc i heard some chord
captain nemo wa there bend over hi organ and plung in a

nautilu will have noth to fear from their attack
the captain finger were then run over the kei of the
instrument and i remark that he touch onli the black kei which
gave hi melodi an essenti scotch charact soon he had
forgotten my presenc and had plung into a reveri that i did not
disturb i went up again on to the platform night had alreadi fallen
for in thi low latitud the sun set rapidli and without twilight i
could onli see the island indistinctli but the numer fire light
on the beach show that the nativ did not think of leav it i
wa alon for sever hour sometim think of the nativesbut
without ani dread of them for the imperturb confid of the

the night slip awai without ani mischanc the island frighten
no doubt at the sight of a monster aground in the bai the panel were
open and would have offer an easi access to the interior of the

at six oclock in the morn of the 8th januari i went up on to the
platform the dawn wa break the island soon show itself through
the dissip fog first the shore then the summit
the nativ were there more numer than on the dai beforef or
six hundr perhapssom of them profit by the low water had come
on to the coral at less than two cablelength from the nautilu i
distinguish them easili thei were true papuan with athlet
figur men of good race larg high forehead larg but not broad

show off on their black shine bodi like those of the nubian
from the lobe of their ear cut and distend hung chaplet of

all were arm with bow arrow and shield and carri on their

high rank for he wa drape in a mat of bananaleav notch round
the edg and set off with brilliant colour
i could easili have knock down thi nativ who wa within a short
length but i thought that it wa better to wait for real hostil
demonstr between european and savag it is proper for the
european to parri sharpli not to attack
dure low water the nativ roam about near the nautilu but were
not troublesom i heard them frequent repeat the word assai and
by their gestur i understood that thei invit me to go on land an
invit that i declin
so that on that dai the boat did not push off to the great
displeasur of master land who could not complet hi provis
thi adroit canadian emploi hi time in prepar the viand and meat
that he had brought off the island as for the savag thei return
to the shore about eleven oclock in the morn as soon as the coral
top began to disappear under the rise tide but i saw their number
had increas consider on the shore probabl thei came from the
neighbour island or veri like from papua howev i had not
seen a singl nativ cano have noth better to do i thought of

that the nautilu would pass in these part if it float in open sea
the next dai accord to captain nemo promis
i therefor call conseil who brought me a littl light drag veri
like those for the oyster fisheri now to work for two hour we fish
unceasingli but without bring up ani rariti the drag wa fill
with midasear harp melam and particularli the most beauti
hammer i have ever seen we also brought up some seaslug
pearloyst and a dozen littl turtl that were reserv for the
pantri on board
but just when i expect it least i put my hand on a wonder i might
sai a natur deform veri rare met with conseil wa just
drag and hi net came up fill with diver ordinari shell when
all at onc he saw me plung my arm quickli into the net to draw out
a shell and heard me utter a cry
what is the matter sir he ask in surpris ha master been
bitten
no my boi but i would willingli have given a finger for my
discoveri
what discoveri
thi shell i said hold up the object of my triumph
it is simpli an oliv porphyri genu oliv order of the
pectinibranchid class of gasteropod subclass mollusca
ye conseil but instead of be roll from right to left thi
oliv turn from left to right
is it possibl
ye my boi it is a left shell
shell ar all righthand with rare except and when by chanc
their spiral is left amateur ar readi to pai their weight in gold
conseil and i were absorb in the contempl of our treasur and i
wa promis myself to enrich the museum with it when a stone
unfortun thrown by a nativ struck against and broke the
preciou object in conseil hand i utter a cry of despair conseil
took up hi gun and aim at a savag who wa pois hi sling at ten
yard from him i would have stop him but hi blow took effect and
broke the bracelet of amulet which encircl the arm of the savag
illustr conseil seiz hi gun
conseil cri i conseil
well sir do you not see that the cannib ha commenc the attack
a shell is not worth the life of a man said i
ah the scoundrel cri conseil i would rather he had broken my
shoulder
conseil wa in earnest but i wa not of hi opinion howev the
situat had chang some minut befor and we had not perceiv a
score of cano surround the nautilu these cano scoop out of
the trunk of a tree long narrow well adapt for speed were
balanc by mean of a long bamboo pole which float on the water
thei were manag by skil halfnak paddler and i watch their
advanc with some uneasi it wa evid that these papuan had
alreadi had deal with the european and knew their ship but thi
long iron cylind anchor in the bai without mast or chimnei what
could thei think of it noth good for at first thei kept at a
respect distanc howev see it motionless by degre thei
took courag and sought to familiaris themselv with it now thi
familiar wa precis what it wa necessari to avoid our arm
which were noiseless could onli produc a moder effect on the
savag who have littl respect for aught but bluster thing the
thunderbolt without the reverber of thunder would frighten man
but littl though the danger li in the lightn not in the nois
at thi moment the cano approach the nautilu and a shower of
arrow alight on her
i went down to the saloon but found no on there i ventur to knock
at the door that open into the captain room come in wa the
answer
i enter and found captain nemo deep in algebra calcul of
x and other quantiti
i am disturb you said i for courtesi sake
that is true m aronnax repli the captain but i think you have
seriou reason for wish to see me
veri grave on the nativ ar surround us in their cano and
in a few minut we shall certainli be attack by mani hundr of
savag
ah said captain nemo quietli thei ar come with their cano
ye sir
well sir we must close the hatch
exactli and i came to sai to you
noth can be more simpl said captain nemo and press an
electr button he transmit an order to the ship crew
it is all done sir said he after some moment the pinnac is
readi and the hatch ar close you do not fear i imagin that
these gentlemen could stave in wall on which the ball of your frigat
have had no effect
no captain but a danger still exist
what is that sir
it is that tomorrow at about thi hour we must open the hatch to
renew the air of the nautilu now if at thi moment the papuan
should occupi the platform i do not see how you could prevent them
from enter
then sir you suppos that thei will board us
i am certain of it
well sir let them come i see no reason for hinder them after
all these papuan ar poor creatur and i am unwil that my visit
to the island should cost the life of a singl on of these wretch
upon that i wa go awai but captain nemo detain me and ask me
to sit down by him he question me with interest about our excurs
on shore and our hunt and seem not to understand the crave for
meat that possess the canadian then the convers turn on
variou subject and without be more commun captain nemo
show himself more amiabl
amongst other thing we happen to speak of the situat of the
nautilu run aground in exactli the same spot in thi strait where
dumont durvil wa nearli lost apropo of thi
thi durvil wa on of your great sailor said the captain to me
on of your most intellig navig he is the captain cook of you
frenchmen unfortun man of scienc after have brave the iceberg
of the south pole the coral reef of oceania the cannib of the
pacif to perish miser in a railwai train if thi energet man
could have reflect dure the last moment of hi life what must
have been uppermost in hi last thought do you suppos
so speak captain nemo seem move and hi emot gave me a
better opinion of him then chart in hand we review the travel of
the french navig hi voyag of circumnavig hi doubl
detent at the south pole which led to the discoveri of adelaid and
loui philipp and fix the hydrograph bear of the princip
island of oceania
that which your durvil ha done on the surfac of the sea said
captain nemo that have i done under them and more easili more
complet than he the astrolab and the zele incessantli toss
about by the hurrican could not be worth the nautilu quiet
repositori of labour that she is truli motionless in the midst of the
water
tomorrow ad the captain rise tomorrow at twenti minut
to three pm the nautilu shall float and leav the strait of
torr uninjur
have curtli pronounc these word captain nemo bow slightli thi
wa to dismiss me and i went back to my room
there i found conseil who wish to know the result of my interview
with the captain
my boi said i when i feign to believ that hi nautilu wa
threaten by the nativ of papua the captain answer me veri
sarcast i have but on thing to sai to you have confid in
him and go to sleep in peac
have you no need of my servic sir
no my friend what is ned land do
if you will excus me sir answer conseil friend ned is busi
make a kangaroopi which will be a marvel
i remain alon and went to bed but slept indiffer i heard the
nois of the savag who stamp on the platform utter deafen
cri the night pass thu without disturb the ordinari repos of
the crew the presenc of these cannib affect them no more than
the soldier of a mask batteri care for the ant that crawl over it
front
at six in the morn i rose the hatch had not been open the
inner air wa not renew but the reservoir fill readi for ani
emerg were now resort to and discharg sever cubic feet of
oxygen into the exhaust atmospher of the nautilu
i work in my room till noon without have seen captain nemo even
for an instant on board no prepar for departur were visibl
i wait still some time then went into the larg saloon the clock
mark halfpast two in ten minut it would be hightid and if
captain nemo had not made a rash promis the nautilu would be
immedi detach if not mani month would pass er she could
leav her bed of coral
howev some warn vibrat began to be felt in the vessel i
heard the keel grate against the rough calcar bottom of the coral
reef
at fiveandtwenti minut to three captain nemo appear in the
saloon
we ar go to start said he
ah repli i
i have given the order to open the hatch
and the papuan
the papuan answer captain nemo slightli shrug hi shoulder
will thei not come insid the nautilu
how
onli by leap over the hatch you have open
m aronnax quietli answer captain nemo thei will not enter the
hatch of the nautilu in that wai even if thei were open
i look at the captain
you do not understand said he
hardli
well come and you will see
i direct my step toward the central staircas there ned land and
conseil were slyli watch some of the ship crew who were open
the hatch while cri of rage and fear vocifer resound
outsid
the port lid were pull down outsid twenti horribl face appear
but the first nativ who place hi hand on the stairrail struck from
behind by some invis forc i know not what fled utter the
most fear cri and make the wildest contort
ten of hi companion follow him thei met with the same fate
conseil wa in ecstasi ned land carri awai by hi violent
instinct rush on to the staircas but the moment he seiz the
rail with both hand he in hi turn wa overthrown
i am struck by a thunderbolt cri he with an oath
thi explain all it wa no rail but a metal cabl charg with
electr from the deck commun with the platform whoever
touch it felt a power shockand thi shock would have been mortal
if captain nemo had discharg into the conductor the whole forc of
the current it might truli be said that between hi assail and
himself he had stretch a network of electr which none could pass
with impun
meanwhil the exasper papuan had beaten a retreat paralys with
terror as for us half laugh we consol and rub the
unfortun ned land who swore like on possess
but at thi moment the nautilu rais by the last wave of the
tide quit her coral bed exactli at the fortieth minut fix by the
captain her screw swept the water slowli and majest her speed
increas gradual and sail on the surfac of the ocean she
quit safe and sound the danger pass of the strait of torr
chapter xxii
gri somnia
the follow dai 10th januari the nautilu continu her cours
between two sea but with such remark speed that i could not
estim it at less than thirtyf mile an hour the rapid of her
screw wa such that i could neither follow nor count it revolut
when i reflect that thi marvel electr agent after have
afford motion heat and light to the nautilu still protect her
from outward attack and transform her into an ark of safeti which no
profan hand might touch without be thunderstricken my admir
wa unbound and from the structur it extend to the engin who
had call it into exist
our cours wa direct to the west and on the 11th of januari we
doubl cape wessel situat in 135 long and 10 s lat which
form the east point of the gulf of carpentaria the reef were still
numer but more equalis and mark on the chart with extrem
precis the nautilu easili avoid the breaker of monei to port
and the victoria reef to starboard place at 130 long and on the
10th parallel which we strictli follow
on the 13th of januari captain nemo arriv in the sea of timor and
recognis the island of that name in 122 long
from thi point the direct of the nautilu inclin toward the
southwest her head wa set for the indian ocean where would the
fanci of captain nemo carri us next would he return to the coast of
asia or would he approach again the shore of europ improb
conjectur both to a man who fled from inhabit contin then
would he descend to the south wa he go to doubl the cape of good
hope then cape horn and final go as far as the antarct pole
would he come back at last to the pacif where hi nautilu could
sail free and independ time would show
after have skirt the sand of cartier of hibernia seringapatam
and scott last effort of the solid against the liquid element on the
14th of januari we lost sight of land altogeth the speed of the
nautilu wa consider abat and with irregular cours she
sometim swam in the bosom of the water sometim float on their
surfac
dure thi period of the voyag captain nemo made some interest
experi on the vari temperatur of the sea in differ bed
under ordinari condit these observ ar made by mean of
rather complic instrument and with somewhat doubt result by
mean of thermometr soundinglead the glass often break
under the pressur of the water or an apparatu ground on the
variat of the resist of metal to the electr current
result so obtain could not be correctli calcul on the contrari
captain nemo went himself to test the temperatur in the depth of the
sea and hi thermomet place in commun with the differ
sheet of water gave him the requir degre immedi and
accur
it wa thu that either by overload her reservoir or by descend
obliqu by mean of her inclin plane the nautilu success
attain the depth of three four five seven nine and ten thousand
yard and the definit result of thi experi wa that the sea
preserv an averag temperatur of four degre and a half at a depth
of five thousand fathom under all latitud
on the 16th of januari the nautilu seem becalm onli a few yard
beneath the surfac of the wave her electr apparatu remain
inact and her motionless screw left her to drift at the merci of the
current i suppos that the crew wa occupi with interior repair
render necessari by the violenc of the mechan movement of the
machin
my companion and i then wit a curiou spectacl the hatch of
the saloon were open and as the beacon light of the nautilu wa
not in action a dim obscur reign in the midst of the water i
observ the state of the sea under these condit and the largest
fish appear to me no more than scarc defin shadow when the
nautilu found herself suddenli transport into full light i
thought at first that the beacon had been light and wa cast it
electr radianc into the liquid mass i wa mistaken and after a
rapid survei perceiv my error
the nautilu float in the midst of a phosphoresc bed which in
thi obscur becam quit dazzl it wa produc by myriad of
lumin animalcula whose brillianc wa increas as thei glide
over the metal hull of the vessel i wa surpris by lightn in
the midst of these lumin sheet as though thei had been rivulet of
lead melt in an ardent furnac or metal mass brought to a white
heat so that by forc of contrast certain portion of light appear
to cast a shade in the midst of the gener ignit from which all
shade seem banish no thi wa not the calm irradi of our
ordinari lightn there wa unusu life and vigour thi wa truli
live light
in realiti it wa an infinit agglomer of colour infusoria of
verit globul of jelli provid with a threadlik tentacl and
of which as mani as twentyf thousand have been count in less than
two cubic halfinch of water
dure sever hour the nautilu float in these brilliant wave
and our admir increas as we watch the marin monster
disport themselv like salamand i saw there in the midst of
thi fire that burn not the swift and eleg porpois the
indefatig clown of the ocean and some swordfish ten feet long
those prophet herald of the hurrican whose formid sword would
now and then strike the glass of the saloon then appear the smaller
fish the balista the leap mackerel wolfthorntail and a
hundr other which stripe the lumin atmospher as thei swam thi
dazzl spectacl wa enchant perhap some atmospher condit
increas the intens of thi phenomenon perhap some storm agit
the surfac of the wave but at thi depth of some yard the
nautilu wa unmov by it furi and repos peacefulli in still
water
so we progress incessantli charm by some new marvel the dai
pass rapidli awai and i took no account of them ned accord to
habit tri to vari the diet on board like snail we were fix to
our shell and i declar it is easi to lead a snail life
thu thi life seem easi and natur and we thought no longer of the
life we led on land but someth happen to recal us to the
strang of our situat
on the 18th of januari the nautilu wa in 105 long and 15 s
lat the weather wa threaten the sea rough and roll there wa
a strong east wind the baromet which had been go down for some
dai forebod a come storm i went up on to the platform just as
the second lieuten wa take the measur of the horari angl and
wait accord to habit till the daili phrase wa said but on thi
dai it wa exchang for anoth phrase not less incomprehens
almost directli i saw captain nemo appear with a glass look
toward the horizon
for some minut he wa immov without take hi ey off the point
of observ then he lower hi glass and exchang a few word
with hi lieuten the latter seem to be a victim to some emot
that he tri in vain to repress captain nemo have more command
over himself wa cool he seem too to be make some object to
which the lieuten repli by formal assur at least i conclud
so by the differ of their tone and gestur for myself i had
look carefulli in the direct indic without see anyth
the sky and water were lost in the clear line of the horizon
howev captain nemo walk from on end of the platform to the other
without look at me perhap without see me hi step wa firm
but less regular than usual he stop sometim cross hi arm
and observ the sea what could he be look for on that immens
expans
the nautilu wa then some hundr of mile from the nearest coast
the lieuten had taken up the glass and examin the horizon
steadfastli go and come stamp hi foot and show more
nervou agit than hi superior offic besid thi mysteri must
necessarili be solv and befor long for upon an order from captain
nemo the engin increas it propel power made the screw turn
more rapidli
just then the lieuten drew the captain attent again the latter
stop walk and direct hi glass toward the place indic he
look long i felt veri much puzzl and descend to the
drawingroom and took out an excel telescop that i gener
us then lean on the cage of the watchlight that jut out from
the front of the platform set myself to look over all the line of the
sky and sea
but my ey wa no sooner appli to the glass than it wa quickli
snatch out of my hand
i turn round captain nemo wa befor me but i did not know him hi
face wa transfigur hi ey flash sullenli hi teeth were set
hi stiff bodi clench fist and head shrunk between hi shoulder
betrai the violent agit that pervad hi whole frame he did
not move my glass fallen from hi hand had roll at hi feet
had i unwittingli provok thi fit of anger did thi incomprehens
person imagin that i had discov some forbidden secret no i wa
not the object of thi hatr for he wa not look at me hi ey
wa steadili fix upon the impenetr point of the horizon at last
captain nemo recov himself hi agit subsid he address
some word in a foreign languag to hi lieuten then turn to me
m aronnax he said in rather an imperi tone i requir you to
keep on of the condit that bind you to me
what is it captain
you must be confin with your companion until i think fit to
releas you
you ar the master i repli look steadili at him but mai i
ask you on question
none sir
there wa no resist thi imperi command it would have been
useless i went down to the cabin occupi by ned land and conseil and
told them the captain determin you mai judg how thi
commun wa receiv by the canadian
but there wa not time for alterc four of the crew wait at the
door and conduct us to that cell where we had pass our first night
on board the nautilu
ned land would have remonstr but the door wa shut upon him
will master tell me what thi mean ask conseil
i told my companion what had pass thei were as much astonish as
i and equal at a loss how to account for it
meanwhil i wa absorb in my own reflect and could think of
noth but the strang fear depict in the captain counten i
wa utterli at a loss to account for it when my cogit were
disturb by these word from ned land
hallo breakfast is readi
and inde the tabl wa laid evid captain nemo had given thi
order at the same time that he had hasten the speed of the
nautilu
will master permit me to make a recommend ask conseil
ye my boi
well it is that master breakfast it is prudent for we do not know
what mai happen
you ar right conseil
unfortun said ned land thei have onli given us the ship
fare
friend ned ask conseil what would you have said if the breakfast
had been entir forgotten
thi argument cut short the harpoon recrimin
we sat down to tabl the meal wa eaten in silenc
just then the lumin globe that light the cell went out and left
us in total dark ned land wa soon asleep and what astonish me
wa that conseil went off into a heavi slumber i wa think what
could have caus hi irresist drowsi when i felt my brain
becom stupefi in spite of my effort to keep my ey open thei
would close a pain suspicion seiz me evid soporif
substanc had been mix with the food we had just taken imprison
wa not enough to conceal captain nemo project from us sleep wa
more necessari i then heard the panel shut the undul of the
sea which caus a slight roll motion ceas had the nautilu
quit the surfac of the ocean had it gone back to the motionless
bed of water i tri to resist sleep it wa imposs my breath
grew weak i felt a mortal cold freez my stiffen and halfparalys
limb my ey lid like leaden cap fell over my ey i could not
rais them a morbid sleep full of hallucin bereft me of my
be then the vision disappear and left me in complet
insens

the next dai i woke with my head singularli clear to my great
surpris i wa in my own room my companion no doubt had been
reinstat in their cabin without have perceiv it ani more than i
of what had pass dure the night thei were as ignor as i wa and
to penetr thi mysteri i onli reckon upon the chanc of the

i then thought of quit my room wa i free again or a prison
quit free i open the door went to the halfdeck went up the
central stair the panel shut the even befor were open i went
on to the platform
ned land and conseil wait there for me i question them thei knew
noth lost in a heavi sleep in which thei had been total
unconsci thei had been astonish at find themselv in their
cabin
as for the nautilu it seem quiet and mysteri as ever it
float on the surfac of the wave at a moder pace noth seem
chang on board
the second lieuten then came on to the platform and gave the usual
order below
as for captain nemo he did not appear
of the peopl on board i onli saw the impass steward who serv me
with hi usual dumb regular
about two oclock i wa in the drawingroom busi in arrang my
note when the captain open the door and appear i bow he made

m aronnax will you consent to prescrib for on of my men he
ask
is he ill
ye
i am readi to follow you
come then
i own my heart beat i do not know why i saw certain connect
between the ill of on of the crew and the event of the dai
befor and thi mysteri interest me at least as much as the sick
man
captain nemo conduct me to the poop of the nautilu and took me
into a cabin situat near the sailor quarter
there on a bed lai a man about forti year of ag with a resolut
express of counten a true type of an anglosaxon
i leant over him he wa not onli ill he wa wound hi head
swath in bandag cover with blood lai on a pillow i undid the
bandag and the wound man look at me with hi larg ey and gave
no sign of pain as i did it it wa a horribl wound the skull
shatter by some deadli weapon left the brain expos which wa much
injur clot of blood had form in the bruis and broken mass in
colour like the dreg of wine
there wa both contus and suffus of the brain hi breath wa
slow and some spasmod movement of the muscl agit hi face i
felt hi puls it wa intermitt the extrem of the bodi were
grow cold alreadi and i saw death must inevit ensu after
dress the unfortun man wound i readjust the bandag on hi
head and turn to captain nemo
what caus thi wound i ask
what doe it signifi he repli evas a shock ha broken on
of the lever of the engin which struck myself but your opinion as
to hi state
i hesit befor give it
you mai speak said the captain thi man doe not understand
french
i gave a last look at the wound man
he will be dead in two hour
can noth save him
noth
captain nemo hand contract and some tear glisten in hi ey
which i thought incap of shed ani
for some moment i still watch the dy man whose life eb
slowli hi pallor increas under the electr light that wa shed
over hi deathb i look at hi intellig forehead furrow with
prematur wrinkl produc probabl by misfortun and sorrow i tri
to learn the secret of hi life from the last word that escap hi
lip
you can go now m aronnax said the captain
i left him in the dy man cabin and return to my room much
affect by thi scene dure the whole dai i wa haunt by
uncomfort suspicion and at night i slept badli and between my
broken dream i fanci i heard distant sigh like the note of a
funer psalm were thei the prayer of the dead murmur in that
languag that i could not understand
the next morn i went on to the bridg captain nemo wa there befor
me as soon as he perceiv me he came to me
professor will it be conveni to you to make a submarin excurs
todai
with my companion i ask
if thei like
we obei your order captain
will you be so good then as to put on your cork jacket
it wa not a question of dead or dy i rejoin ned land and
conseil and told them of captain nemo proposit conseil hasten
to accept it and thi time the canadian seem quit will to follow
our exampl
it wa eight oclock in the morn at halfpast eight we were
equip for thi new excurs and provid with two contriv for
light and breath the doubl door wa open and accompani by
captain nemo who wa follow by a dozen of the crew we set foot at
a depth of about thirti feet on the solid bottom on which the
nautilu rest
a slight decliv end in an uneven bottom at fifteen fathom depth
thi bottom differ entir from the on i had visit on my first
excurs under the water of the pacif ocean here there wa no
fine sand no submarin prairi no seaforest i immedi
recognis that marvel region in which on that dai the captain
did the honour to us it wa the coral kingdom
the light produc a thousand charm varieti plai in the midst
of the branch that were so vividli colour i seem to see the
membran and cylindr tube trembl beneath the undul of the
water i wa tempt to gather their fresh petal ornament with
delic tentacl some just blown the other bud while a small
fish swim swiftli touch them slightli like flight of bird
but if my hand approach these live flower these anim
sensit plant the whole coloni took alarm the white petal
reenter their red case the flower fade as i look and the bush
chang into a block of stoni knob
chanc had thrown me just by the most preciou specimen of the
zoophyt thi coral wa more valuabl than that found in the
mediterranean on the coast of franc itali and barbari it tint
justifi the poetic name of flower of blood and froth of
blood that trade ha given to it most beauti product coral
is sold for 20 per ounc and in thi place the wateri bed would make
the fortun of a compani of coraldiv thi preciou matter often
confus with other polypi form then the inextric plot call
macciota and on which i notic sever beauti specimen of pink
coral
but soon the bush contract and the arboris increas real
petrifi thicket long joint of fantast architectur were
disclos befor us captain nemo place himself under a dark galleri
where by a slight decliv we reach a depth of a hundr yard the
light from our lamp produc sometim magic effect follow the
rough outlin of the natur arch and pendant dispos like
lustr that were tip with point of fire
at last after walk two hour we had attain a depth of about
three hundr yard that is to sai the extrem limit on which coral
begin to form but there wa no isol bush nor modest brushwood
at the bottom of lofti tree it wa an immens forest of larg miner
veget enorm petrifi tree unit by garland of eleg
seabindwe all adorn with cloud and reflect we pass freeli
under their high branch lost in the shade of the wave
captain nemo had stop i and my companion halt and turn
round i saw hi men were form a semicircl round their chief
watch attent i observ that four of them carri on their
shoulder an object of an oblong shape
we occupi in thi place the centr of a vast glade surround by
the lofti foliag of the submarin forest our lamp threw over thi
place a sort of clear twilight that singularli elong the shadow on
the ground at the end of the glade the dark increas and wa
onli reliev by littl spark reflect by the point of coral
ned land and conseil were near me we watch and i thought i wa
go to wit a strang scene on observ the ground i saw that
it wa rais in certain place by slight excresc encrust with
limi deposit and dispos with a regular that betrai the hand of
man
in the midst of the glade on a pedest of rock roughli pile up
stood a cross of coral that extend it long arm that on might have
thought were made of petrifi blood upon a sign from captain nemo on
of the men advanc and at some feet from the cross he began to dig a
hole with a pickax that he took from hi belt i understood all thi
glade wa a cemeteri thi hole a tomb thi oblong object the bodi of
the man who had di in the night the captain and hi men had come to
buri their companion in thi gener restingplac at the bottom of
thi inaccess ocean
the grave wa be dug slowli the fish fled on all side while their
retreat wa be thu disturb i heard the stroke of the pickax
which sparkl when it hit upon some flint lost at the bottom of the
water the hole wa soon larg and deep enough to receiv the bodi
then the bearer approach the bodi envelop in a tissu of white
linen wa lower into the damp grave captain nemo with hi arm
cross on hi breast and all the friend of him who had love them
knelt in prayer
illustr all fell on their knee in an attitud of prayer
the grave wa then fill in with the rubbish taken from the ground
which form a slight mound when thi wa done captain nemo and hi
men rose then approach the grave thei knelt again and all
extend their hand in sign of a last adieu then the funer
process return to the nautilu pass under the arch of the
forest in the midst of thicket along the coral bush and still on
the ascent at last the light of the ship appear and it lumin
track guid us to the nautilu at on oclock we had return
as soon as i had chang my cloth i went up on to the platform and
a prei to conflict emot i sat down near the binnacl captain
nemo join me i rose and said to him
so as i said he would thi man di in the night

the indian ocean
we now come to the second part of our journei under the sea the first
end with the move scene in the coral cemeteri which left such a
deep impress on my mind thu in the midst of thi great sea
captain nemo life wa pass even to hi grave which he had
prepar in on of it deepest abyss there not on of the ocean
monster could troubl the last sleep of the crew of the nautilu of
those friend rivet to each other in death as in life nor ani man
either had ad the captain still the same fierc implac
defianc toward human societi
i could no longer content myself with the theori which satisfi
conseil
that worthi fellow persist in see in the command of the
nautilu on of those unknown savant who return mankind contempt
for indiffer for him he wa a misunderstood geniu who tire of
earth decept had taken refug in thi inaccess medium where
he might follow hi instinct freeli to my mind thi explain but on
side of captain nemo charact inde the mysteri of that last
night dure which we had been chain in prison the sleep and the
precaut so violent taken by the captain of snatch from my ey
the glass i had rais to sweep the horizon the mortal wound of the
man due to an unaccount shock of the nautilu all put me on a
new track no captain nemo wa not satisfi with shun man hi
formid apparatu not onli suit hi instinct of freedom but
perhap also the design of some terribl retali
at thi moment noth is clear to me i catch but a glimps of light
amidst all the dark and i must confin myself to write as event
shall dictat
that dai the 24th of januari 1868 at noon the second offic came
to take the altitud of the sun i mount the platform lit a cigar
and watch the oper it seem to me that the man did not
understand french for sever time i made remark in a loud voic
which must have drawn from him some involuntari sign of attent if
he had understood them but he remain undisturb and dumb
as he wa take observ with the sextant on of the sailor of
the nautilu the strong man who had accompani us on our first
submarin excurs to the island of crespo came to clean the glass
of the lantern i examin the fit of the apparatu the strength
of which wa increas a hundredfold by lenticular ring place
similar to those in a lighthous and which project their brillianc
in a horizont plane the electr lamp wa combin in such a wai as
to give it most power light inde it wa produc in vacuo
which insur both it steadi and it intens thi vacuum
economis the graphit point between which the lumin arc wa
developedan import point of economi for captain nemo who could not
easili have replac them and under these condit their wast wa
impercept when the nautilu wa readi to continu it submarin
journei i went down to the saloon the panel wa close and the
cours mark direct west
we were furrow the water of the indian ocean a vast liquid plain
with a surfac of 1200000000 of acr and whose water ar so clear
and transpar that ani on lean over them would turn giddi the
nautilu usual float between fifti and a hundr fathom deep we
went on so for some dai to anyon but myself who had a great love
for the sea the hour would have seem long and monoton but the
daili walk on the platform when i steep myself in the reviv air
of the ocean the sight of the rich water through the window of the
saloon the book in the librari the compil of my memoir took up
all my time and left me not a moment of ennui or weari
for some dai we saw a great number of aquat bird seamew or
gull some were cleverli kill and prepar in a certain wai made
veri accept watergam amongst largewing bird carri a long
distanc from all land and rest upon the wave from the fatigu of
their flight i saw some magnific albatross utter discord
cri like the brai of an ass and bird belong to the famili of
the longw
as to the fish thei alwai provok our admir when we surpris
the secret of their aquat life through the open panel i saw mani
kind which i never befor had a chanc of observ
i shall notic chiefli ostracion peculiar to the red sea the indian
ocean and that part which wash the coast of tropic america these
fish like the tortois the armadillo the seahedgehog and the
crustacea ar protect by a breastplat which is neither chalki nor
stoni but real bone in some it take the form of a solid triangl in
other of a solid quadrangl amongst the triangular i saw some an inch
and a half in length with wholesom flesh and a delici flavour
thei ar brown at the tail and yellow at the fin and i recommend
their introduct into fresh water to which a certain number of
seafish easili accustom themselv i would also mention quadrangular
ostracion have on the back four larg tubercl some dot over
with white spot on the lower part of the bodi and which mai be tame
like bird trigon provid with spike form by the lengthen of
their boni shell and which from their strang grunt ar call
seapig also dromedari with larg hump in the shape of a cone
whose flesh is veri tough and leatheri
i now borrow from the daili note of master conseil certain fish of
the genu petrodon peculiar to those sea with red back and white
chest which ar distinguish by three row of longitudin
filament and some electr seven inch long deck in the
liveliest colour then as specimen of other kind some ovoid
resembl an egg of a dark brown colour mark with white band and
without tail diodon real seaporcupin furnish with spike and
capabl of swell in such a wai as to look like cushion bristl
with dart hippocampi common to everi ocean some pegasi with
lengthen snout which their pector fin be much elong and
form in the shape of wing allow if not to fly at least to shoot
into the air pigeon spatula with tail cover with mani ring of
shell macrognathi with long jaw an excel fish nine inch long
and bright with most agreeabl colour palecolour calliomor with
rug head and plenti of chaetpdon with long and tubular muzzl
which kill insect by shoot them as from an airgun with a singl
drop of water these we mai call the flycatch of the sea
in the eightyninth genu of fish class by laceped belong to
the second lower class of boni characteris by opercul and
bronchial membran i remark the scorpaena the head of which is
furnish with spike and which ha but on dorsal fin these
creatur ar cover or not with littl shell accord to the
subclass to which thei belong the second subclass give us specimen
of didactyl fourteen or fifteen inch in length with yellow rai
and head of a most fantast appear as to the first subclass it
give sever specimen of that singular look fish appropri
call a seafrog with larg head sometim pierc with hole
sometim swollen with protuber bristl with spike and
cover with tubercl it ha irregular and hideou horn it bodi
and tail ar cover with callos it sting make a danger
wound it is both repugn and horribl to look at
from the 21st to the 23rd of januari the nautilu went at the rate of
two hundr and fifti leagu in twentyfour hour be five hundr
and forti mile or twentytwo mile an hour if we recognis so mani
differ varieti of fish it wa becaus attract by the electr
light thei tri to follow us the greater part howev were soon
distanc by our speed though some kept their place in the water of
the nautilu for a time the morn of the 24th in 12 5 s lat
and 94 33 long we observ keel island a coral format
plant with magnific coco and which had been visit by mr
darwin and captain fitzroi the nautilu skirt the shore of thi
desert island for a littl distanc it net brought up numer
specimen of polypi and curiou shell of mollusca some preciou
product of the speci of delphinula enrich the treasur of
captain nemo to which i ad an astraea punctifera a kind of
parasit polypu often found fix to a shell
soon keel island disappear from the horizon and our cours wa
direct to the northwest in the direct of the indian peninsula
from keel island our cours wa slower and more variabl often
take us into great depth sever time thei made us of the
inclin plane which certain intern lever place obliqu to the
waterlin in that wai we went about two mile but without ever
obtain the greatest depth of the indian sea which sound of
seven thousand fathom have never reach as to the temperatur of the
lower strata the thermomet invari indic 4 abov zero i
onli observ that in the upper region the water wa alwai colder in
the high level than at the surfac of the sea
on the 25th of januari the ocean wa entir desert the nautilu
pass the dai on the surfac beat the wave with it power
screw and make them rebound to a great height who under such
circumst would not have taken it for a gigant cetacean three
part of thi dai i spent on the platform i watch the sea noth
on the horizon till about four oclock a steamer run west on our
counter her mast were visibl for an instant but she could not see
the nautilu be too low in the water i fanci thi steamboat
belong to the po compani which run from ceylon to sydnei
touch at king georg point and melbourn
at five oclock in the even befor that fleet twilight which
bind night to dai in tropic zone conseil and i were astonish by
a curiou spectacl
it wa a shoal of argonaut travel along on the surfac of the
ocean we could count sever hundr thei belong to the tubercl
kind which ar peculiar to the indian sea
these grace mollusc move backward by mean of their locomot
tube through which thei propel the water alreadi drawn in of their
eight tentacl six were elong and stretch out float on the
water whilst the other two roll up flat were spread to the wing
like a light sail i saw their spiralshap and flute shell which
cuvier justli compar to an eleg skiff a boat inde it bear the
creatur which secret it without it adher to it
for nearli an hour the nautilu float in the midst of thi shoal of
mollusc then i know not what sudden fright thei took but as if at a
signal everi sail wa furl the arm fold the bodi drawn in the
shell turn over chang their centr of graviti and the whole
fleet disappear under the wave never did the ship of a squadron
manuvr with more uniti
at that moment night fell suddenli and the reed scarc rais by
the breez lai peaceabl under the side of the nautilu
the next dai 26th of januari we cut the equat at the eightysecond
meridian and enter the northern hemispher dure the dai a
formid troop of shark accompani us terribl creatur which
multipli in these sea and make them veri danger thei were
cestracio philippi shark with brown back and whitish belli
arm with eleven row of teethei sharkstheir throat be mark
with a larg black spot surround with white like an ey there were
also some isabella shark with round snout mark with dark spot
these power creatur often hurl themselv at the window of the
saloon with such violenc as to make us feel veri insecur at such
time ned land wa no longer master of himself he want to go to the
surfac and harpoon the monster particularli certain smoothhound
shark whose mouth is stud with teeth like a mosaic and larg
tigershark nearli six yard long the last name of which seem to
excit him more particularli but the nautilu acceler her
speed easili left the most rapid of them behind
the 27th of januari at the entranc of the vast bai of bengal we met
repeatedli a forbid spectacl dead bodi float on the surfac
of the water thei were the dead of the indian villag carri by the
gang to the level of the sea and which the vultur the onli
undertak of the countri had not been abl to devour but the shark
did not fail to help them at their funer work
about seven oclock in the even the nautilu halfimmers wa
sail in a sea of milk at first sight the ocean seem lactifi
wa it the effect of the lunar rai no for the moon scarc two
dai old wa still ly hidden under the horizon in the rai of the
sun the whole sky though lit by the sider rai seem black by
contrast with the white of the water
conseil could not believ hi ey and question me as to the caus
of thi strang phenomenon happili i wa abl to answer him
it is call a milk sea i explain a larg extent of white
wavelet often to be seen on the coast of amboyna and in these part
of the sea
but sir said conseil can you tell me what caus such an effect
for i suppos the water is not realli turn into milk
no my boi and the white which surpris you is caus onli by
the presenc of myriad of infusoria a sort of lumin littl worm
gelatin and without colour of the thick of a hair and whose
length is not more than seventhousandth of an inch these insect
adher to on anoth sometim for sever leagu
sever leagu exclaim conseil
ye my boi and you need not try to comput the number of these
infusoria you will not be abl for if i am not mistaken ship have
float on these milk sea for more than forti mile
toward midnight the sea suddenli resum it usual colour but behind
us even to the limit of the horizon the sky reflect the whiten
wave and for a long time seem impregn with the vagu
glimmer of an aurora boreali
chapter ii
a novel propos of captain nemo
on the 28th of februari when at noon the nautilu came to the
surfac of the sea in 9 4 n lat there wa land in sight about
eight mile to westward the first thing i notic wa a rang of
mountain about two thousand feet high the shape of which were most
caprici on take the bear i knew that we were near the
island of ceylon the pearl which hang from the lobe of the indian
peninsula
captain nemo and hi second appear at thi moment the captain
glanc at the map then turn to me said

see the fishermen the annual export ha not yet begun never
mind i will give order to make for the gulf of manaar where we shall
arriv in the night
the captain said someth to hi second who immedi went out

show that she wa about thirti feet deep
well sir said captain nemo you and your companion shall visit
the bank of manaar and if by chanc some fisherman should be there we
shall see him at work

perspir let us reflect said i and take our time hunt
otter in submarin forest as we did in the island of crespo will
pass but go up and down at the bottom of the sea where on is
almost certain to meet shark is quit anoth thing i know well that
in certain countri particularli in the andaman island the negro
never hesit to attack them with a dagger in on hand and a run
noos in the other but i also know that few who affront those
creatur ever return aliv howev i am not a negro and if i were i
think a littl hesit in thi case would not be illtim

substanc which thei wear on their finger their neck or their
ear for the chemist it is a mixtur of phosphat and carbon of
lime with a littl gelatin and lastli for naturalist it is simpli
a morbid secret of the organ that produc the motherofpearl
amongst certain bivalv
branch of mollusc said conseil
precis so my learn conseil and amongst these testacea the
earshel the tridacna the turbot in a word all those which
secret motherofpearl that is the blue bluish violet or white
substanc which line the interior of their shell ar capabl of
produc pearl
mussel too ask the canadian
ye mussel of certain water in scotland wale ireland saxoni
bohemia and franc
good for the futur i shall pai attent repli the canadian
but i continu the particular mollusc which secret the pearl is
the pearloyst the meleagrina margaritiferct that preciou
pintadin the pearl is noth but a nacreou format deposit in
a globular form either adher to the oyster shell or buri in the
fold of the creatur on the shell it is fast in the flesh it is
loos but alwai ha for a kernel a small hard substanc mai be a
barren egg mai be a grain of sand around which the pearli matter
deposit itself year after year success and by thin concentr
layer
ar mani pearl found in the same oyster ask conseil
ye my boi some ar a perfect casket on oyster ha been mention

certainli not said conseil but will you tell us now by what mean
thei extract these pearl
thei proce in variou wai when thei adher to the shell the
fishermen often pull them off with pincer but the most common wai is
to lai the oyster on mat of the seawe which cover the bank thu
thei die in the open air and at the end of ten dai thei ar in a
forward state of decomposit thei ar then plung into larg
reservoir of seawat then thei ar open and wash
the price of these pearl vari accord to their size ask
conseil
not onli accord to their size i answer but also accord to
their shape their water that is their colour and their lustr
that is that bright and diaper sparkl which make them so charm
to the ey the most beauti ar call virgin pearl or paragon

opaqu and sometim have the transpar of an opal thei ar
gener round or oval the round ar made into bracelet the oval
into pendant and be more preciou ar sold singli those
adher to the shell of the oyster ar more irregular in shape and
ar sold by weight lastli in a lower order ar class those small
pearl known under the name of seedpearl thei ar sold by measur
and ar especi us in embroideri for church ornament
but said conseil is thi pearlfisheri danger

chapter iii
a pearl of ten million
the next morn at four oclock i wa awaken by the steward whom
captain nemo had place at my servic i rose hurriedli dress and
went into the saloon
captain nemo wa await me
m aronnax said he ar you readi to start
i am readi
then pleas to follow me
and my companion captain
thei have been told and ar wait
ar we not to put on our diver dress ask i
not yet i have not allow the nautilu to come too near thi
coast and we ar some distanc from the manaar bank but the boat is
readi and will take us to the exact point of disembark which will
save us a long wai it carri our dive apparatu which we will put
on when we begin our submarin journei
captain nemo conduct me to the central staircas which led on the
platform ned and conseil were alreadi there delight at the idea of
the pleasur parti which wa prepar five sailor from the
nautilu with their oar wait in the boat which had been made
fast against the side
the night wa still dark layer of cloud cover the sky allow
but few star to be seen i look on the side where the land lai and
saw noth but a dark line enclos three part of the horizon from
southwest to north west the nautilu have return dure the
night up the western coast of ceylon wa now west of the bai or
rather gulf form by the mainland and the island of manaar there
under the dark water stretch the pintadin bank an inexhaust
field of pearl the length of which is more than twenti mile
captain nemo ned land conseil and i took our place in the stern of
the boat the master went to the tiller hi four companion lean on
their oar the painter wa cast off and we sheer off
the boat went toward the south the oarsmen did not hurri i notic
that their stroke strong in the water onli follow each other everi
ten second accord to the method gener adopt in the navi
whilst the craft wa run by it own veloc the liquid drop
struck the dark depth of the wave crispli like spat of melt lead
a littl billow spread wide gave a slight roll to the boat and
some samphir reed flap befor it
we were silent what wa captain nemo think of perhap of the land
he wa approach and which he found too near to him contrari to the
canadian opinion who thought it too far off as to conseil he wa
mere there from curios
about halfpast five the first tint on the horizon show the upper
line of coast more distinctli flat enough in the east it rose a
littl to the south five mile still lai between us and it wa
indistinct ow to the mist on the water at six oclock it becam
suddenli daylight with that rapid peculiar to tropic region
which know neither dawn nor twilight the solar rai pierc the
curtain of cloud pile up on the eastern horizon and the radiant orb
rose rapidli i saw land distinctli with a few tree scatter here
and there the boat near manaar island which wa round to the
south captain nemo rose from hi seat and watch the sea
at a sign from him the anchor wa drop but the chain scarc ran
for it wa littl more than a yard deep and thi spot wa on of the
highest point of the bank of pintadin
here we ar m aronnax said captain nemo you see that enclos
bai here in a month will be assembl the numer fish boat of
the export and these ar the water their diver will ransack so
boldli happili thi bai is well situat for that kind of fish it
is shelter from the strongest wind the sea is never veri rough
here which make it favour for the diver work we will now put
on our dress and begin our walk
i did not answer and while watch the suspect wave began with
the help of the sailor to put on my heavi seadress captain nemo and
my companion were also dress none of the nautilu men were to
accompani us on thi new excurs
soon we were envelop to the throat in indiarubb cloth the air
apparatu fix to our back by brace as to the ruhmkorff apparatu
there wa no necess for it befor put my head into the copper
cap i had ask the question of the captain
thei would be useless he repli we ar go to no great depth
and the solar rai will be enough to light our walk besid it would
not be prudent to carri the electr light in these water it
brillianc might attract some of the danger inhabit of the coast
most inopportun
as captain nemo pronounc these word i turn to conseil and ned
land but my two friend had alreadi encas their head in the metal
cap and thei could neither hear nor answer
on last question remain to ask of captain nemo
and our arm ask i our gun
gun what for do not mountain attack the bear with a dagger in
their hand and is not steel surer than lead here is a strong blade
put it in your belt and we start
i look at my companion thei were arm like us and more than
that ned land wa brandish an enorm harpoon which he had place
in the boat befor leav the nautilu
then follow the captain exampl i allow myself to be dress
in the heavi copper helmet and our reservoir of air were at onc in
activ an instant after we were land on after the other in
about two yard of water upon an even sand captain nemo made a sign
with hi hand and we follow him by a gentl decliv till we
disappear under the wave
over our feet like covei of snipe in a bog rose shoal of fish of
the genu monoptera which have no other fin but their tail i
recogn the javanes a real serpent two and a half feet long of a
livid colour underneath and which might easili be mistaken for a
conger eel if it were not for the golden stripe on it side in the
genu stromateu whose bodi ar veri flat and oval i saw some of
the most brilliant colour carri their dorsal fin like a scyth an
excel eat fish which dri and pickl is known by the name
of karawad then some tranquebar belong to the genu
apsiphoroid whose bodi is cover with a shell cuirass of eight
longitudin plate
the heighten sun lit the mass of water more and more the soil
chang by degre to the fine sand succeed a perfect causewai of
boulder cover with a carpet of mollusc and zoophyt amongst the
specimen of these branch i notic some placena with thin unequ
shell a kind of ostracion peculiar to the red sea and the indian
ocean some orang lucina with round shell rockfish three feet and
a half long which rais themselv under the wave like hand readi
to seiz on there were also some panopyr slightli lumin and
lastli some oculin like magnific fan form on of the
richest veget of these sea
in the midst of these live plant and under the arbour of the
hydrophyt were layer of clumsi articul particularli some
ranina whose carapac form a slightli round triangl and some
horribl look parthenop
at about seven oclock we found ourselv at last survei the
oysterbank on which the pearloyst ar reproduc by million
captain nemo point with hi hand to the enorm heap of oyster and
i could well understand that thi mine wa inexhaust for natur
creativ power is far beyond man instinct of destruct ned land
faith to hi instinct hasten to fill a net which he carri by
hi side with some of the finest specimen but we could not stop we
must follow the captain who seem to guid him self by path known
onli to himself the ground wa sensibl rise and sometim on
hold up my arm it wa abov the surfac of the sea then the level
of the bank would sink caprici often we round high rock
scarp into pyramid in their dark fractur huge crustacea perch
upon their high claw like some warmachin watch us with fix
ey and under our feet crawl variou kind of annelid
at thi moment there open befor us a larg grotto dug in a
picturesqu heap of rock and carpet with all the thick warp of the
submarin flora at first it seem veri dark to me the solar rai
seem to be extinguish by success gradat until it vagu
transpar becam noth more than drown light captain nemo
enter we follow my ey soon accustom themselv to thi
rel state of dark i could distinguish the arch spring
caprici from natur pillar stand broad upon their granit
base like the heavi column of tuscan architectur why had our
incomprehens guid led us to the bottom of thi submarin crypt i
wa soon to know after descend a rather sharp decliv our feet
trod the bottom of a kind of circular pit there captain nemo stop
and with hi hand indic an object i had not yet perceiv it wa
an oyster of extraordinari dimens a gigant tridacn a goblet
which could have contain a whole lake of holywat a basin the
breadth of which wa more than two yard and a half and consequ
larger than that ornament the saloon of the nautilu i approach
thi extraordinari mollusc it adher by it filament to a tabl of
granit and there isol it develop itself in the calm water of
the grotto i estim the weight of thi tridacn at 600 lb such an
oyster would contain 30 lb of meat and on must have the stomach of
a gargantua to demolish some dozen of them
captain nemo wa evid acquaint with the exist of thi
bivalv and seem to have a particular motiv in verifi the actual
state of thi tridacn the shell were a littl open the captain came
near and put hi dagger between to prevent them from close then with
hi hand he rais the membran with it fring edg which form a
cloak for the creatur there between the fold plait i saw a loos
pearl whose size equal that of a coconut it globular shape
perfect clear and admir lustr made it altogeth a jewel of
inestim valu carri awai by my curios i stretch out my
hand to seiz it weigh it and touch it but the captain stop me
made a sign of refus and quickli withdrew hi dagger and the two
shell close suddenli i then understood captain nemo intent in
leav thi pearl hidden in the mantl of the tridacn he wa allow
it to grow slowli each year the secret of the mollusc would add
new concentr circl i estim it valu at 500000 at least
after ten minut captain nemo stop suddenli i thought he had
halt previous to return no by a gestur he bade us crouch
besid him in a deep fractur of the rock hi hand point to on part
of the liquid mass which i watch attent
about five yard from me a shadow appear and sank to the ground the
disquiet idea of shark shot through my mind but i wa mistaken
and onc again it wa not a monster of the ocean that we had anyth
to do with
it wa a man a live man an indian a fisherman a poor devil who i
suppos had come to glean befor the harvest i could see the bottom
of hi cano anchor some feet abov hi head he dive and went up
success a stone held between hi feet cut in the shape of a
sugar loaf whilst a rope fasten him to hi boat help him to
descend more rapidli thi wa all hi apparatu reach the bottom
about five yard deep he went on hi knee and fill hi bag with
oyster pick up at random then he went up empti it pull up hi
stone and began the oper onc more which last thirti second
the diver did not see us the shadow of the rock hid us from sight and
how should thi poor indian ever dream that men be like himself
should be there under the water watch hi movement and lose no
detail of the fish sever time he went up in thi wai and dive
again he did not carri awai more than ten at each plung for he wa
oblig to pull them from the bank to which thei adher by mean of
their strong byssu and how mani of those oyster for which he risk
hi life had no pearl in them i watch him close hi manuvr
were regular and for the space of half an hour no danger appear to
threaten him
i wa begin to accustom myself to the sight of thi interest
fish when suddenli as the indian wa on the ground i saw him make
a gestur of terror rise and make a spring to return to the surfac
of the sea
i understood hi dread a gigant shadow appear just abov the
unfortun diver it wa a shark of enorm size advanc
diagon hi ey on fire and hi jaw open i wa mute with horror
and unabl to move
the voraci creatur shot toward the indian who threw himself on
on side to avoid the shark fin but not it tail for it struck hi
chest and stretch him on the ground
thi scene last but a few second the shark return and turn
on hi back prepar himself for cut the indian in two when i saw
captain nemo rise suddenli and then dagger in hand walk straight to
the monster readi to fight face to face with him the veri moment the
shark wa go to snap the unhappi fisherman in two he perceiv hi
new adversari and turn over made straight toward him
i can still see captain nemo posit hold himself well togeth
he wait for the shark with admir cool and when it rush at
him threw himself on on side with wonder quick avoid the
shock and buri hi dagger deep into it side but it wa not all
over a terribl combat ensu
illustr a terribl combat began
the shark had seem to roar if i might sai so the blood rush in
torrent from it wound the sea wa dy red and through the opaqu
liquid i could distinguish noth more noth more until the moment
when like lightn i saw the undaunt captain hang on to on of
the creatur fin struggl as it were hand to hand with the
monster and deal success blow at hi enemi yet still unabl to
give a decis on
the shark struggl agit the water with such furi that the
rock threaten to upset me
i want to go to the captain assist but nail to the spot
with horror i could not stir
i saw the haggard ey i saw the differ phase of the fight the
captain fell to the earth upset by the enorm mass which leant upon
him the shark jaw open wide like a pair of factori shear and
it would have been all over with the captain but quick as thought
harpoon in hand ned land rush toward the shark and struck it with
it sharp point
the wave were impregn with a mass of blood thei rock under the
shark movement which beat them with indescrib furi ned land
had not miss hi aim it wa the monster deathrattl struck to
the heart it struggl in dread convuls the shock of which
overthrew conseil
but ned land had disentangl the captain who get up without ani
wound went straight to the indian quickli cut the cord which held him
to hi stone took him in hi arm and with a sharp blow of hi heel
mount to the surfac
we all three follow in a few second save by a miracl and reach
the fisherman boat
captain nemo first care wa to recal the unfortun man to life
again i did not think he could succe i hope so for the poor
creatur immers wa not long but the blow from the shark tail
might have been hi deathblow
happili with the captain and conseil sharp friction i saw
conscious return by degre he open hi ey what wa hi
surpris hi terror even at see four great copper head lean
over him and abov all what must he have thought when captain nemo
draw from the pocket of hi dress a bag of pearl place it in hi
hand thi munific chariti from the man of the water to the poor
cingales wa accept with a trembl hand hi wonder ey show
that he knew not to what superhuman be he ow both fortun and
life
at a sign from the captain we regain the bank and follow the
road alreadi travers came in about half an hour to the anchor which
held the cano of the nautilu to the earth
onc on board we each with the help of the sailor got rid of the
heavi copper helmet
captain nemo first word wa to the canadian
thank you master land said he
it wa in reveng captain repli ned land i ow you that
a ghastli smile pass across the captain lip and that wa all
to the nautilu said he
the boat flew over the wave some minut after we met the shark
dead bodi float by the black mark of the extrem of it fin
i recognis the terribl melanopteron of the indian sea of the
speci of shark so properli call it wa more than twentyf feet
long it enorm mouth occupi onethird of it bodi it wa an
adult as wa known by it six row of teeth place in an isoscel
triangl in the upper jaw
whilst i wa contempl thi inert mass a dozen of these voraci
beast appear round the boat and without notic us threw
themselv upon the dead bodi and fought with on anoth for the
piec
at halfpast eight we were again on board the nautilu there i
reflect on the incid which had taken place in our excurs to
the manaar bank
two conclus i must inevit draw from iton bear upon the
unparallel courag of captain nemo the other upon hi devot to a
human be a repres of that race from which he fled beneath
the sea whatev he might sai thi strang man had not yet succeed
in entir crush hi heart
when i made thi observ to him he answer in a slightli move
tone
that indian sir is an inhabit of an oppress countri and i am
still and shall be to my last breath on of them
chapter iv
the red sea
in the cours of the dai of the 29th of januari the island of ceylon
disappear under the horizon and the nautilu at a speed of twenti
mile an hour slid into the labyrinth of canal which separ the
maldiv from the laccad it coast even the island of kiltan a
land origin coralin discov by vasco da gama in 1499 and on
of the nineteen princip island of the laccad archipelago
situat between 10 and 14 30 n lat and 69 50 72 e long
we had made 16220 mile or 7500 french leagu from our
startingpoint in the japanes sea
the next dai 30th januari when the nautilu went to the surfac of
the ocean there wa no land in sight it cours wa nne in the
direct of the sea of oman between arabia and the indian peninsula
which serv as an outlet to the persian gulf it wa evid a block
without ani possibl egress where wa captain nemo take us to i
could not sai thi howev did not satisfi the canadian who that
dai came to me ask where we were go
we ar go where our captain fanci take us master ned
hi fanci cannot take us far then said the canadian the persian
gulf ha no outlet and if we do go in it will not be long befor we
ar out again
veri well then we will come out again master land and if after
the persian gulf the nautilu would like to visit the red sea the
strait of babelmandeb ar there to give us entranc
i need not tell you sir said ned land that the red sea is as much
close as the gulf as the isthmu of suez is not yet cut and if it
wa a boat as mysteri as our would not risk itself in a canal cut
with sluic and again the red sea is not the road to take us back to
europ
but i never said we were go back to europ
what do you suppos then
i suppos that after visit the curiou coast of arabia and egypt
the nautilu will go down the indian ocean again perhap cross the
channel of mozambiqu perhap off the mascarenha so as to gain the
cape of good hope
and onc at the cape of good hope ask the canadian with peculiar
emphasi
well we shall penetr into that atlant which we do not yet know
ah friend ned you ar get tire of thi journei under the sea
you ar surfeit with the incessantli vari spectacl of submarin
wonder for my part i shall be sorri to see the end of a voyag which
it is given to so few men to make
for four dai till the 3rd of februari the nautilu scour the sea
of oman at variou speed and at variou depth it seem to go at
random as if hesit as to which road it should follow but we
never pass the tropic of cancer
in quit thi sea we sight muscat for an instant on of the most
import town of the countri of oman i admir it strang aspect
surround by black rock upon which it white hous and fort stood
in relief i saw the round dome of it mosqu the eleg point
of it minaret it fresh and verdant terrac but it wa onli a
vision the nautilu soon sank under the wave of that part of the
sea
we pass along the arabian coast of mahrah and hadramaut for a
distanc of six mile it undul line of mountain be
occasion reliev by some ancient ruin the 5th of februari we at
last enter the gulf of aden a perfect funnel introduc into the
neck of babelmandeb through which the indian water enter the red
sea
the 6th of februari the nautilu float in sight of aden perch
upon a promontori which a narrow isthmu join to the mainland a kind
of inaccess gibraltar the fortif of which were rebuilt by
the english after take possess in 1839 i caught a glimps of the
octagon minaret of thi town which wa at on time the richest
commerci magazin on the coast
i certainli thought that captain nemo arriv at thi point would
back out again but i wa mistaken for he did no such thing much to
my surpris
the next dai the 7th of februari we enter the strait of
babelmandeb the name of which in the arab tongu mean the gate of
tear
to twenti mile in breadth it is onli thirtytwo in length and for
the nautilu start at full speed the cross wa scarc the
work of an hour but i saw noth not even the island of perim with
which the british govern ha fortifi the posit of aden there
were too mani english or french steamer of the line of suez to bombai
calcutta to melbourn and from bourbon to the mauritiu furrow
thi narrow passag for the nautilu to ventur to show itself so
it remain prudent below at last about noon we were in the water
of the red sea
i would not even seek to understand the capric which had decid
captain nemo upon enter the gulf but i quit approv of the
nautilu enter it it speed wa lessen sometim it kept on
the surfac sometim it dive to avoid a vessel and thu i wa abl
to observ the upper and lower part of thi curiou sea
the 8th of februari from the first dawn of dai mocha came in sight
now a ruin town whose wall would fall at a gunshot yet which
shelter here and there some verdant datetre onc an import
citi contain six public market and twentysix mosqu and whose
wall defend by fourteen fort form a girdl of two mile in
circumfer
the nautilu then approach the african shore where the depth of
the sea wa greater there between two water clear as crystal
through the open panel we were allow to contempl the beauti
bush of brilliant coral and larg block of rock cloth with a
splendid fur of green varieti of site and landscap along these
sandbank and alg and fuci what an indescrib spectacl and what
varieti of site and landscap along these sandbank and volcan
island which bound the libyan coast but where these shrub appear
in all their beauti wa on the eastern coast which the nautilu soon
gain it wa on the coast of tehama for there not onli did thi
displai of zoophyt flourish beneath the level of the sea but thei
also form picturesqu interlac which unfold themselv about
sixti feet abov the surfac more caprici but less highli colour
than those whose fresh wa kept up by the vital power of the
water
what charm hour i pass thu at the window of the saloon what new
specimen of submarin flora and fauna did i admir under the
bright of our electr lantern
the 9th of februari the nautilu float in the broadest part of the
red sea which is compris between souakin on the west coast and
komfidah on the east coast with a diamet of nineti mile
that dai at noon after the bear were taken captain nemo mount
the platform where i happen to be and i wa determin not to let
him go down again without at least press him regard hi ulterior
project as soon as he saw me he approach and gracious offer me
a cigar
well sir doe thi red sea pleas you have you suffici
observ the wonder it cover it fish it zoophyt it
parterr of spong and it forest of coral did you catch a glimps
of the town on it border
ye captain nemo i repli and the nautilu is wonderfulli
fit for such a studi ah it is an intellig boat
ye sir intellig and invulner it fear neither the terribl
tempest of the red sea nor it current nor it sandbank
certainli said i thi sea is quot as on of the worst and in
the time of the ancient if i am not mistaken it reput wa
detest
detest m aronnax the greek and latin historian do not speak
favour of it and strabo sai it is veri danger dure the
etesian wind and in the raini season the arabian edrisi portrai it
under the name of the gulf of colzoum and relat that vessel
perish there in great number on the sandbank and that no on would
risk sail in the night it is he pretend a sea subject to fear
hurrican strewn with inhospit island and which offer noth
good either on it surfac or in it depth
on mai see i repli that these historian never sail on board
the nautilu
just so repli the captain smile and in that respect modern
ar not more advanc than the ancient it requir mani ag to find
out the mechan power of steam who know if in anoth hundr
year we mai not see a second nautilu progress is slow m
aronnax
it is true i answer your boat is at least a centuri befor it
time perhap an era what a misfortun that the secret of such an
invent should die with it inventor
captain nemo did not repli after some minut silenc he continu
you were speak of the opinion of ancient historian upon the
danger navig of the red sea
it is true said i but were not their fear exagger
ye and no m aronnax repli captain nemo who seem to know the
red sea by heart that which is no longer danger for a modern
vessel well rig strongli built and master of it own cours
thank to obedi steam offer all sort of peril to the ship of
the ancient pictur to yourself those first navig ventur in
ship made of plank sewn with the cord of the palmtre satur
with the greas of the seadog and cover with powder resin thei
had not even instrument wherewith to take their bear and thei
went by guess amongst current of which thei scarc knew anyth
under such condit shipwreck were and must have been numer
but in our time steamer run between suez and the south sea have
noth more to fear from the furi of thi gulf in spite of contrari
tradewind the captain and passeng do not prepar for their
departur by offer propitiatori sacrific and on their return
thei no longer go ornament with wreath and gilt fillet to thank the
god in the neighbour templ
i agre with you said i and steam seem to have kill all
gratitud in the heart of sailor but captain sinc you seem to
have especi studi thi sea can you tell me the origin of it
name
there exist sever explan on the subject m aronnax would you
like to know the opinion of a chronicl of the fourteenth centuri
willingli
thi fanci writer pretend that it name wa given to it after the
passag of the israelit when pharaoh perish in the wave which
close at the voic of mose
a poet explan captain nemo i repli but i cannot content
myself with that i ask you for your person opinion
here it is m aronnax accord to my idea we must see in thi
appel of the red sea a translat of the hebrew word edom and
if the ancient gave it that name it wa on account of the particular
colour of it water
but up to thi time i have seen noth but transpar wave and
without ani particular colour
veri like but as we advanc to the bottom of the gulf you will see
thi singular appear i rememb see the bai of tor entir
red like a sea of blood
and you attribut thi colour to the presenc of a microscop
seawe
ye
so captain nemo it is not the first time you have overrun the red
sea on board the nautilu
no sir
as you spoke a while ago of the passag of the israelit and of the
catastroph to the egyptian i will ask whether you have met with the
trace under the water of thi great histor fact
no sir and for a good reason
what is it
it is that the spot where mose and hi peopl pass is now so
block up with sand that the camel can bare bath their leg there
you can well understand that there would not be water enough for my
nautilu
and the spot i ask
the spot is situat a littl abov the isthmu of suez in the arm
which formerli made a deep estuari when the red sea extend to the
salt lake now whether thi passag were miracul or not the
israelit nevertheless cross there to reach the promis land and
pharaoh armi perish precis on that spot and i think that
excav made in the middl of the sand would bring to light a larg
number of arm and instrument of egyptian origin
that is evid i repli and for the sake of archaeologist let
us hope that these excav will be made sooner or later when new
town ar establish on the isthmu after the construct of the
suez canal a canal howev veri useless to a vessel like the
nautilu
veri like but us to the whole world said captain nemo the
ancient well understood the util of a commun between the red
sea and the mediterranean for their commerci affair but thei did
not think of dig a canal direct and took the nile as an
intermedi veri probabl the canal which unit the nile to the red
sea wa begun by sesostri if we mai believ tradit on thing is
certain that in the year 615 befor jesu christ neco undertook the
work of an alimentari canal to the water of the nile across the plain
of egypt look toward arabia it took four dai to go up thi
canal and it wa so wide that two trirem could go abreast it wa
carri on by dariu the son of hystasp and probabl finish by
ptolemi ii strabo saw it navig but it declin from the point of
departur near bubast to the red sea wa so slight that it wa onli
navig for a few month in the year thi canal answer all
commerci purpos to the ag of antoniu when it wa abandon and
block up with sand restor by order of the caliph omar it wa
definit destroi in 761 or 762 by caliph almansor who wish to
prevent the arriv of provis to mohammedbenabdallah who had
revolt against him dure the expedit into egypt your gener
bonapart discov trace of the work in the desert of suez and
surpris by the tide he nearli perish befor regain hadjaroth
at the veri place where mose had encamp three thousand year befor
him
well captain what the ancient dare not undertak thi junction
between the two sea which will shorten the road from cadiz to india
m lessep ha succeed in do and befor long he will have chang
africa into an immens island
ye m aronnax you have the right to be proud of your countryman
such a man bring more honour to a nation than great captain he
began like so mani other with disgust and rebuff but he ha
triumph for he ha the geniu of will and it is sad to think that a
work like that which ought to have been an intern work and
which would have suffic to make a reign illustri should have
succeed by the energi of on man all honour to m lessep
ye honour to the great citizen i repli surpris by the manner
in which captain nemo had just spoken
unfortun he continu i cannot take you through the suez
canal but you will be abl to see the long jetti of port said after
tomorrow when we shall be in the mediterranean
the mediterranean i exclaim
ye sir doe that astonish you
what astonish me is to think that we shall be there the dai after
tomorrow
inde
ye captain although by thi time i ought to have accustom myself
to be surpris at noth sinc i have been on board your boat
but the caus of thi surpris
well it is the fear speed you will have to put on the nautilu
if the dai after tomorrow she is to be in the mediterranean have
made the round of africa and doubl the cape of good hope
who told you that she would make the round of africa and doubl the
cape of good hope sir
well unless the nautilu sail on dry land and pass abov the
isthmu
or beneath it m aronnax
beneath it
certainli repli captain nemo quietli a long time ago natur made
under thi tongu of land what man ha thi dai made on it surfac
what such a passag exist
ye a subterranean passag which i have name the arabian tunnel it
take us beneath suez and open into the gulf of pelusium
but thi isthmu is compos of noth but quick sand
to a certain depth but at fiftyf yard onli there is a solid
layer of rock
did you discov thi passag by chanc i ask more and more
surpris
chanc and reason sir and by reason even more than by chanc
not onli doe thi passag exist but i have profit by it sever
time without that i should not have ventur thi dai into the
impass red sea i notic that in the red sea and in the
mediterranean there exist a certain number of fish of a kind
perfectli ident certain of the fact i ask myself wa it
possibl that there wa no commun between the two sea if there
wa the subterranean current must necessarili run from the red sea to
the mediterranean from the sole caus of differ of level i caught
a larg number of fish in the neighbourhood of suez i pass a
copper ring through their tail and threw them back into the sea some
month later on the coast of syria i caught some of my fish
ornament with the ring thu the commun between the two wa
prove i then sought for it with my nautilu i discov it
ventur into it and befor long sir you too will have pass
through my arabian tunnel
chapter v
the arabian tunnel
that same even in 21 30 n lat the nautilu float on the
surfac of the sea approach the arabian coast i saw djeddah the
most import countinghous of egypt syria turkei and india i
distinguish clearli enough it build the vessel anchor at the
quai and those whose draught of water oblig them to anchor in the
road the sun rather low on the horizon struck full on the hous of
the town bring out their white outsid some wooden cabin
and some made of reed show the quarter inhabit by the bedouin
soon djeddah wa shut out from view by the shadow of night and the
nautilu found herself under water slightli phosphoresc
the next dai the 10th of februari we sight sever ship run to
windward the nautilu return to it submarin navig but at
noon when her bear were taken the sea be desert she rose
again to her waterlin
accompani by ned and conseil i seat myself on the platform the
coast on the eastern side look like a mass faintli print upon a
damp fog
we were lean on the side of the pinnac talk of on thing and
anoth when ned land stretch out hi hand toward a spot on the
sea said
do you see anyth there sir
no ned i repli but i have not your ey you know
look well said ned there on the starboard beam about the height
of the lantern do you not see a mass which seem to move
certainli said i after close attent i see someth like a
long black bodi on the top of the water
and certainli befor long the black object wa not more than a mile
from us it look like a great sandbank deposit in the open sea it
wa a gigant dugong
ned land look eagerli hi ey shone with covet at the sight
of the anim hi hand seem readi to harpoon it on would have
thought he wa await the moment to throw himself into the sea and
attack it in it element
at thi instant captain nemo appear on the platform he saw the
dugong understood the canadian attitud and address him said
if you held a harpoon just now master land would it not burn your
hand
just so sir
and you would not be sorri to go back for on dai to your trade of a
fisherman and to add thi cetacean to the list of those you have
alreadi kill
i should not sir
well you can try
thank you sir said ned land hi ey flame
onli continu the captain i advis you for your own sake not to
miss the creatur
is the dugong danger to attack i ask in spite of the
canadian shrug of the shoulder
ye repli the captain sometim the anim turn upon it
assail and overturn their boat but for master land thi danger is
not to be fear hi ey is prompt hi arm sure
at thi moment seven men of the crew mute and immov as ever
mount the platform on carri a harpoon and a line similar to those
emploi in catch whale the pinnac wa lift from the bridg
pull from it socket and let down into the sea six oarsmen took
their seat and the coxswain went to the tiller ned conseil and i
went to the back of the boat
you ar not come captain i ask
no sir but i wish you good sport
the boat put off and lift by the six rower drew rapidli toward
the dugong which float about two mile from the nautilu
arriv some cableslength from the cetacean the speed slacken and
the oar dip noiselessli into the quiet water ned land harpoon in
hand stood in the fore part of the boat the harpoon us for strike
the whale is gener attach to a veri long cord which run out
rapidli as the wound creatur draw it after him but here the cord
wa not more than ten fathom long and the extrem wa attach to a
small barrel which by float wa to show the cours the dugong took
under the water
i stood and carefulli watch the canadian adversari thi dugong
which also bear the name of the halicor close resembl the
manate it oblong bodi termin in a lengthen tail and it
later fin in perfect finger it differ from the manate
consist in it upper jaw which wa arm with two long and point
teeth which form on each side diverg tusk
thi dugong which ned land wa prepar to attack wa of coloss
dimens it wa more than seven yard long it did not move and
seem to be sleep on the wave which circumst made it easier
to captur
the boat approach within six yard of the anim the oar rest on
the rowlock i half rose ned land hi bodi thrown a littl back
brandish the harpoon in hi experienc hand
suddenli a hiss nois wa heard and the dugong disappear the
harpoon although thrown with great forc had appar onli struck
the water
curs it exclaim the canadian furious i have miss it
no said i the creatur is woundedlook at the blood but your
weapon ha not stuck in hi bodi
my harpoon my harpoon cri ned land
the sailor row on and the coxswain made for the float barrel
the harpoon regain we follow in pursuit of the anim
the latter came now and then to the surfac to breath it wound had
not weaken it for it shot onward with great rapid
the boat row by strong arm flew on it track sever time it
approach within some few yard and the canadian wa readi to strike
but the dugong made off with a sudden plung and it wa imposs to
reach it
imagin the passion which excit impati ned land he hurl at the
unfortun creatur the most energet explet in the english
tongu for my part i wa onli vex to see the dugong escap all our
attack
we pursu it without relax for an hour and i began to think it
would prove difficult to captur when the anim possess with the
pervers idea of vengeanc of which he had caus to repent turn upon
the pinnac and assail us in it turn
thi manuvr did not escap the canadian
look out he cri
the coxswain said some word in hi outlandish tongu doubtless
warn the men to keep on their guard
the dugong came within twenti feet of the boat stop snif the
air briskli with it larg nostril not pierc at the extrem but
in the upper part of it muzzl then take a spring he threw
himself upon us
the pinnac could not avoid the shock and half upset ship at least
two ton of water which had to be empti but thank to the
coxswain we caught it sidewai not full front so we were not quit
overturn while ned land cling to the bow belabour the
gigant anim with blow from hi harpoon the creatur teeth were
buri in the gunwal and it lift the whole thing out of the water
as a lion doe a roebuck we were upset over on anoth and i know
not how the adventur would have end if the canadian still enrag
with the beast had not struck it to the heart
i heard it teeth grind on the iron plate and the dugong disappear
carri the harpoon with him but the barrel soon return to the
surfac and shortli after the bodi of the anim turn on it back
the boat came up with it took it in tow and made straight for the
nautilu
it requir tackl of enorm strength to hoist the dugong on to the
platform it weigh 10000 lb
the next dai 11th februari the larder of the nautilu wa enrich
by some more delic game a flight of seaswallow rest on the
nautilu it wa a speci of the sterna nilotica peculiar to egypt
it beak is black head grei and point the ey surround by white
spot the back wing and tail of a greyish colour the belli and
throat white and claw red thei also took some dozen of nile duck a
wild bird of high flavour it throat and upper part of the head white
with black spot
about five oclock in the even we sight to the north the cape of
rasmoham thi cape form the extrem of arabia petraea
compris between the gulf of suez and the gulf of acabah
the nautilu penetr into the strait of jubal which lead to the
gulf of suez i distinctli saw a high mountain tower between the
two gulf of rasmoham it wa mount horeb that sinai at the top of
which mose saw god face to face
at six oclock the nautilu sometim float sometim immers
pass some distanc from tor situat at the end of the bai the
water of which seem tint with red an observ alreadi made by
captain nemo then night fell in the midst of a heavi silenc
sometim broken by the cri of the pelican and other nightbird and
the nois of the wave break upon the shore chafe against the
rock or the pant of some faroff steamer beat the water of the
gulf with it noisi paddl
from eight to nine oclock the nautilu remain some fathom under
the water accord to my calcul we must have been veri near
suez through the panel of the saloon i saw the bottom of the rock
brilliantli lit up by our electr lamp we seem to be leav the
strait behind us more and more
at a quarterpast nine the vessel have return to the surfac i
mount the platform most impati to pass through captain nemo
tunnel i could not stai in on place so came to breath the fresh
night air
soon in the shadow i saw a pale light half discolour by the fog
shine about a mile from us
a float lighthous said someon near me
i turn and saw the captain
it is the float light of suez he continu it will not be long
befor we gain the entranc of the tunnel
the entranc cannot be easi
no sir for that reason i am accustom to go into the steersman
cage and myself direct our cours and now if you will go down m
aronnax the nautilu is go under the wave and will not return
to the surfac until we have pass through the arabian tunnel
captain nemo led me toward the central staircas half wai down he
open a door travers the upper deck and land in the pilot
cage which it mai be rememb rose at the extrem of the platform
it wa a cabin measur six feet squar veri much like that occupi
by the pilot on the steamboat of the mississippi or hudson in the
midst work a wheel place vertic and caught to the tillerrop
which ran to the back of the nautilu four lightport with
lenticular glass let in a groov in the partit of the cabin
allow the man at the wheel to see in all direct
thi cabin wa dark but soon my ey accustom themselv to the
obscur and i perceiv the pilot a strong man with hi hand
rest on the spoke of the wheel outsid the sea appear vividli
lit up by the lantern which shed it rai from the back of the cabin
to the other extrem of the platform
now said captain nemo let us try to make our passag
electr wire connect the pilot cage with the machineri room and
from there the captain could commun simultan to hi
nautilu the direct and the speed he press a metal knob and at
onc the speed of the screw diminish
i look in silenc at the high straight wall we were run by at
thi moment the immov base of a massiv sandi coast we follow
it thu for an hour onli some few yard off
captain nemo did not take hi ey from the knob suspend by it two
concentr circl in the cabin at a simpl gestur the pilot
modifi the cours of the nautilu everi instant
i had place myself at the portscuttl and saw some magnific
substructur of coral zoophyt seawe and fucu agit their
enorm claw which stretch out from the fissur of the rock
at a quarterpast ten the captain himself took the helm a larg
galleri black and deep open befor us the nautilu went boldli
into it a strang roar wa heard round it side it wa the water
of the red sea which the inclin of the tunnel precipit violent
toward the mediterranean the nautilu went with the torrent rapid
as an arrow in spite of the effort of the machineri which in order
to offer more effect resist beat the wave with revers screw
on the wall of the narrow passag i could see noth but brilliant
rai straight line furrow of fire trace by the great speed under
the brilliant electr light my heart beat fast
at thirtyf minut past ten captain nemo quit the helm and
turn to me said
the mediterranean
in less than twenti minut the nautilu carri along by the
torrent had pass through the isthmu of suez
chapter vi
the grecian archipelago
the next dai the 12th of februari at the dawn of dai the nautilu
rose to the surfac i hasten on to the platform three mile to the
south the dim outlin of pelusium wa to be seen a torrent had carri
us from on sea to anoth about seven oclock ned and conseil join
me
well sir naturalist said the canadian in a slightli jovial tone
and the mediterranean
we ar float on it surfac friend ned
what said conseil thi veri night
ye thi veri night in a few minut we have pass thi impass
isthmu
i do not believ it repli the canadian
then you ar wrong master land i continu thi low coast which
round off to the south is the egyptian coast and you who have such
good ey ned you can see the jetti of port said stretch into the
sea
the canadian look attent
certainli you ar right sir and your captain is a firstrat man we
ar in the mediterranean good now if you pleas let us talk of our
own littl affair but so that no on hear us
i saw what the canadian want and in ani case i thought it better
to let him talk as he wish it so we all three went and sat down
near the lantern where we were less expos to the sprai of the
blade
now ned we listen what have you to tell us
what i have to tell you is veri simpl we ar in europ and befor
captain nemo capric drag us onc more to the bottom of the polar
sea or lead us into oceania i ask to leav the nautilu
i wish in no wai to shackl the liberti of my companion but i
certainli felt no desir to leav captain nemo
thank to him and thank to hi apparatu i wa each dai nearer the
complet of my submarin studi and i wa rewrit my book of
submarin depth in it veri element should i ever again have such an
opportun of observ the wonder of the ocean no certainli not
and i could not bring myself to the idea of abandon the nautilu
befor the cycl of investig wa accomplish
friend ned answer me frankli ar you tire of be on board ar
you sorri that destini ha thrown us into captain nemo hand
the canadian remain some moment without answer then cross
hi arm he said
frankli i do not regret thi journei under the sea i shall be glad
to have made it but now that it is made let us have done with it
that is my idea
it will come to an end ned
where and when
where i do not knowwhen i cannot sai or rather i suppos it will
end when these sea have noth more to teach us
then what do you hope for demand the canadian
that circumst mai occur as well six month henc as now by which
we mai and ought to profit
oh said ned land and where shall we be in six month if you
pleas sir naturalist
perhap in china you know the nautilu is a rapid travel it
goe through water as swallow through the air or as an express on the
land it doe not fear frequent sea who can sai that it mai not
beat the coast of franc england or america on which flight mai be
attempt as advantag as here
m aronnax repli the canadian your argument ar rotten at the
foundat you speak in the futur we shall be there we shall be
here i speak in the present we ar here and we must profit by
it
ned land logic press me hard and i felt myself beaten on that
ground i knew not what argument would now tell in my favour
sir continu ned let us suppos an imposs if captain nemo
should thi dai offer you your liberti would you accept it
i do not know i answer
and if he ad the offer made you thi dai wa never to be
renew would you accept it
friend ned thi is my answer your reason is against me we must
not reli on captain nemo goodwil common prudenc forbid him to
set us at liberti on the other side prudenc bid us profit by the
first opportun to leav the nautilu
well m aronnax that is wise said
onli on observationjust on the occas must be seriou and our
first attempt must succe if it fail we shall never find anoth
and captain nemo will never forgiv us
all that is true repli the canadian but your observ appli
equal to all attempt at flight whether in two year time or in
two dai but the question is still thi if a favour opportun
present itself it must be seiz
agre and now ned will you tell me what you mean by a favour
opportun
it will be that which on a dark night will bring the nautilu a
short distanc from some european coast
and you will try and save yourself by swim
ye if we were near enough to the bank and if the vessel wa
float at the time not if the bank wa far awai and the boat wa
under the water
and in that case
in that case i should seek to make myself master of the pinnac i
know how it is work we must get insid and the bolt onc drawn we
shall come to the surfac of the water without even the pilot who is
in the bow perceiv our flight
well ned watch for the opportun but do not forget that a hitch
will ruin us
i will not forget sir
and now ned would you like to know what i think of your project
certainli m aronnax
well i thinki do not sai i hopei think that thi favour
opportun will never present itself
why not
becaus captain nemo cannot hide from himself that we have not given
up all hope of regain our liberti and he will be on hi guard
abov all in the sea and in the sight of european coast
we shall see repli ned land shake hi head determinedli
and now ned land i ad let us stop here not anoth word on
the subject the dai that you ar readi come and let us know and we
will follow you i reli entir upon you
thu end a convers which at no veri distant time led to such
grave result i must sai here that fact seem to confirm my
foresight to the canadian great despair did captain nemo distrust
us in these frequent sea or did he onli wish to hide himself from
the numer vessel of all nation which plough the mediterranean
i could not tell but we were often between water and far from the
coast or if the nautilu did emerg noth wa to be seen but the
pilot cage and sometim it went to great depth for between the
grecian archipelago and asia minor we could not touch the bottom by
more than a thousand fathom
thu i onli knew we were near the island of carpatho on of the
sporad by captain nemo recit these line from virgil
est carpathio neptuni gurgit vate
caeruleu proteu
as he point to a spot on the planispher
it wa inde the ancient abod of proteu the old shepherd of
neptun flock now the island of scarpanto situat between rhode
and crete i saw noth but the granit base through the glass panel
of the saloon
the next dai the 14th of februari i resolv to emploi some hour in
studi the fish of the archipelago but for some reason or other
the panel remain hermet seal upon take the cours of the
nautilu i found that we were go toward candia the ancient isl
of crete at the time i embark on the abraham lincoln the whole of
thi island had risen in insurrect against the despot of the
turk but how the insurg had fare sinc that time i wa
absolut ignor and it wa not captain nemo depriv of all land
commun who could tell me
i made no allus to thi event when that night i found myself alon
with him in the saloon besid he seem to be taciturn and
preoccupi then contrari to hi custom he order both panel to be
open and go from on to the other observ the mass of water
attent to what end i could not guess so on my side i emploi
my time in studi the fish pass befor my ey
in the midst of the water a man appear a diver carri at hi
belt a leathern purs it wa not a bodi abandon to the wave it wa
a live man swim with a strong hand disappear occasion to
take breath at the surfac
i turn toward captain nemo and in an agit voic exclaim
a man shipwreck he must be save at ani price
illustr a man a shipwreck sailor i cri
the captain did not answer me but came and lean against the panel
the man had approach and with hi face flatten against the glass
wa look at us
to my great amaz captain nemo sign to him the diver answer
with hi hand mount immedi to the surfac of the water and did
not appear again
do not be uncomfort said captain nemo it is nichola of cape
matapan surnam pesca he is well known in all the cyclad a bold
diver water is hi element and he live more in it than on land
go continu from on island to anoth even as far as crete
you know him captain
why not m aronnax
sai which captain nemo went toward a piec of furnitur stand
near the left panel of the saloon near thi piec of furnitur i saw
a chest bound with iron on the cover of which wa a copper plate
bear the cypher of the nautilu with it devic
at that moment the captain without notic my presenc open the
piec of furnitur a sort of strong box which held a great mani
ingot
thei were ingot of gold from whenc came thi preciou metal which
repres an enorm sum where did the captain gather thi gold
from and what wa he go to do with it
i did not sai on word i look captain nemo took the ingot on by
on and arrang them method in the chest which he fill
entir i estim the content at more than 4000 lb weight of
gold that is to sai nearli 200000
the chest wa secur fasten and the captain wrote an address on
the lid in charact which must have belong to modern greec
thi done captain nemo press a knob the wire of which commun
with the quarter of the crew four men appear and not without some
troubl push the chest out of the saloon then i heard them hoist
it up the iron staircas by mean of pullei
at that moment captain nemo turn to me
and you were sai sir said he
i wa sai noth captain
then sir if you will allow me i will wish you good night
whereupon he turn and left the saloon
i return to my room much troubl as on mai believ i vainli tri
to sleepi sought the connect link between the apparit of the
diver and the chest fill with gold soon i felt by certain movement
of pitch and toss that the nautilu wa leav the depth and
return to the surfac
then i heard step upon the platform and i knew thei were unfasten
the pinnac and launch it upon the wave for on instant it struck
the side of the nautilu then all nois ceas
two hour after the same nois the same go and come wa renew
the boat wa hoist on board replac in it socket and the
nautilu again plung under the wave
so these million had been transport to their address to what point
of the contin who wa captain nemo correspond
the next dai i relat to conseil and the canadian the event of the
night which had excit my curios to the highest degre my
companion were not less surpris than myself
but where doe he take hi million to ask ned land
to that there wa no possibl answer i return to the saloon after
have breakfast and set to work till five oclock in the even i
emploi myself in arrang my note at that momentought i to
attribut it to some peculiar idiosyncrasyi felt so great a heat that
i wa oblig to take off my coat it wa strang for we were under
low latitud and even then the nautilu submerg as it wa ought
to experi no chang of temperatur i look at the manomet it
show a depth of sixti feet to which atmospher heat could never
attain
i continu my work but the temperatur rose to such a pitch as to be
intoler
could there be fire on board i ask myself
i wa leav the saloon when captain nemo enter he approach the
thermomet consult it and turn to me said
fortytwo degre
i have notic it captain i repli and if it get much hotter we
cannot bear it
oh sir it will not get better if we do not wish it
you can reduc it as you pleas then
no but i can go farther from the stove which produc it
it is outward then
certainli we ar float in a current of boil water
is it possibl i exclaim
look
the panel open and i saw the sea entir white all round a
sulphur smoke wa curl amid the wave which boil like water in
a copper i place my hand on on of the pane of glass but the heat
wa so great that i quickli took it off again
where ar we i ask
near the island of santorin sir repli the captain i wish to
give you a sight of the curiou spectacl of a submarin erupt
i thought said i that the format of these new island wa
end
noth is ever end in the volcan part of the sea repli
captain nemo and the globe is alwai be work by subterranean
fire alreadi in the nineteenth year of our era accord to
cassiodoru and plini a new island theia the divin appear in
the veri place where these islet have recent been form then thei
sank under the wave to rise again in the year 69 when thei again
subsid sinc that time to our dai the plutonian work ha been
suspend but on the 3rd of februari 1866 a new island which thei
name georg island emerg from the midst of the sulphur vapour
near nea kamenni and settl again the 6th of the same month seven
dai after the 13th of februari the island of aphroessa appear
leav between nea kamenni and itself a canal ten yard broad i wa
in these sea when the phenomenon occur and i wa abl therefor to
observ all the differ phase the island of aphroessa of round
form measur 300 feet in diamet and 30 feet in height it wa
compos of black and vitreou lava mix with fragment of felspar
and lastli on the 10th of march a smaller island call reka show
itself near nea kamenni and sinc then these three have join
togeth form but on and the same island
and the canal in which we ar at thi moment i ask
here it is repli captain nemo show me a map of the
archipelago you see i have mark the new island
i return to the glass the nautilu wa no longer move the heat
wa becom unbear the sea which till now had been white wa
red ow to the presenc of salt of iron in spite of the ship
be hermet seal an insupport smell of sulphur fill the
saloon and the brillianc of the electr wa entir extinguish
by bright scarlet flame i wa in a bath i wa choke i wa
broil
we can remain no longer in thi boil water said i to the captain
it would not be prudent repli the impass captain nemo
an order wa given the nautilu tack about and left the furnac it
could not brave with impun a quarter of an hour after we were
breath fresh air on the surfac the thought then struck me that if
ned land had chosen thi part of the sea for our flight we should
never have come aliv out of thi sea of fire
the next dai the 16th of februari we left the basin which between
rhode and alexandria is reckon about 1500 fathom in depth and
the nautilu pass some distanc from cerigo quit the grecian
archipelago after have doubl cape matapan
chapter vii
the mediterranean in fortyeight hour
the mediterranean the blue sea par excel the great sea of the
hebrew the sea of the greek the mare nostrum of the roman
border by orangetre alo cacti and seapin embalm with
the perfum of the myrtl surround by rude mountain satur with
pure and transpar air but incessantli work by underground fire
a perfect battlefield in which neptun and pluto still disput the
empir of the world
it is upon these bank and on these water sai michelet that man is
renew in on of the most power climat of the globe but
beauti as it wa i could onli take a rapid glanc at the basin
whose superfici area is two million of squar yard even captain
nemo knowledg wa lost to me for thi puzzl person did not
appear onc dure our passag at full speed i estim the cours
which the nautilu took under the wave of the sea at about six
hundr leagu and it wa accomplish in fortyeight hour start
on the morn of the 16th of februari from the shore of greec we
had cross the strait of gibraltar by sunris on the 18th
it wa plain to me that thi mediterranean enclos in the midst of
those countri which he wish to avoid wa distast to captain
nemo those wave and those breez brought back too mani remembr
if not too mani regret here he had no longer that independ and
that liberti of gait which he had when in the open sea and hi
nautilu felt itself cramp between the close shore of africa and
europ
our speed wa now twentyf mile an hour it mai be well understood
that ned land to hi great disgust wa oblig to renounc hi
intend flight he could not launch the pinnac go at the rate of
twelv or thirteen yard everi second to quit the nautilu under
such condit would be as bad as jump from a train go at full
speedan imprud thing to sai the least of it besid our vessel
onli mount to the surfac of the wave at night to renew it stock of
air it wa steer entir by the compass and the log
i saw no more of the interior of thi mediterranean than a travel by
express train perceiv of the landscap which fli befor hi ey
that is to sai the distant horizon and not the nearer object which
pass like a flash of lightn
we were then pass between sicili and the coast of tuni in the
narrow space between cape bon and the strait of messina the bottom of
the sea rose almost suddenli there wa a perfect bank on which there
wa not more than nine fathom of water whilst on either side the
depth wa nineti fathom
the nautilu had to manuvr veri carefulli so as not to strike
against thi submarin barrier
i show conseil on the map of the mediterranean the spot occupi by
thi reef
but if you pleas sir observ conseil it is like a real isthmu
join europ to africa
ye my boi it form a perfect bar to the strait of lybia and the
sound of smith have prove that in former time the contin
between cape boco and cape furina were join
i can well believ it said conseil
i will add i continu that a similar barrier exist between
gibraltar and ceuta which in geolog time form the entir
mediterranean
what if some volcan burst should on dai rais these two barrier
abov the wave
it is not probabl conseil
well but allow me to finish pleas sir if thi phenomenon should
take place it will be troublesom for m lessep who ha taken so
much pain to pierc the isthmu
i agre with you but i repeat conseil thi phenomenon will never
happen the violenc of subterranean forc is ever diminish
volcano so plenti in the first dai of the world ar be
extinguish by degre the intern heat is weaken the temperatur
of the lower strata of the globe is lower by a percept quantiti
everi centuri to the detriment of our globe for it heat is it life
but the sun
the sun is not suffici conseil can it give heat to a dead bodi
not that i know of
well my friend thi earth will on dai be that cold corps it will
becom uninhabit and uninhabit like the moon which ha long
sinc lost all it vital heat
in how mani centuri
in some hundr of thousand of year my boi
then said conseil we shall have time to finish our journeythat
is if ned land doe not interfer with it
and conseil reassur return to the studi of the bank which the
nautilu wa skirt at a moder speed
dure the night of the 16th and 17th februari we had enter the
second mediterranean basin the greatest depth of which wa 1450
fathom the nautilu by the action of it crew slid down the
inclin plane and buri itself in the lowest depth of the sea
on the 18th of februari about three oclock in the morn we were at
the entranc of the strait of gibraltar there onc exist two
current an upper on long sinc recognis which convei the water
of the ocean into the basin of the mediterranean and a lower
countercurr which reason ha now shown to exist inde the
volum of water in the mediterranean incessantli ad to by the wave
of the atlant and by river fall into it would each year rais
the level of thi sea for it evapor is not suffici to restor
the equilibrium as it is not so we must necessarili admit the
exist of an undercurr which empti into the basin of the
atlant through the strait of gibraltar the surplu water of the
mediterranean a fact inde and it wa thi countercurr by which
the nautilu profit it advanc rapidli by the narrow pass for
on instant i caught a glimps of the beauti ruin of the templ of
hercul buri in the ground accord to plini and with the low
island which support it and a few minut later we were float on
the atlant
chapter viii
vigo bai
the atlant a vast sheet of water whose superfici area cover
twentyf million of squar mile the length of which is nine
thousand mile with a mean breadth of two thousand seven hundredan
ocean whose parallel wind shore embrac an immens circumfer
water by the largest river of the world the st lawrenc the

field of water incessantli plough by vessel of everi nation
shelter by the flag of everi nation and which termin in those
two terribl point so dread by marin cape horn and the cape of
tempest
the nautilu wa pierc the water with it sharp spur after have
accomplish nearli ten thousand leagu in three month and a half a
distanc greater than the great circl of the earth where were we
go now and what wa reserv for the futur the nautilu
leav the strait of gibraltar had gone far out it return to the
surfac of the wave and our daili walk on the platform were restor
to us
i mount at onc accompani by ned land and conseil at a distanc
of about twelv mile cape st vincent wa dimli to be seen form
the southwestern point of the spanish peninsula a strong southerli
gale wa blow the sea wa swollen and billowi it made the
nautilu rock violent it wa almost imposs to keep on foot
on the platform which the heavi roll of the sea beat over everi
instant so we descend after inhal some mouth of fresh air
i return to my room conseil to hi cabin but the canadian with a
preoccupi air follow me our rapid passag across the
mediterranean had not allow him to put hi project into execut
and he could not help show hi disappoint when the door of my
room wa shut he sat down and look at me silent
friend ned said i i understand you but you cannot reproach
yourself to have attempt to leav the nautilu under the
circumst would have been folli
ned land did not answer hi compress lip and frown brow show
with him the violent possess thi fix idea had taken of hi mind
let us see i continu we need not despair yet we ar go up
the coast of portug again franc and england ar not far off where
we can easili find refug now if the nautilu on leav the
strait of gibraltar had gone to the south if it had carri us
toward region where there were no contin i should share your
uneasi but we know now that captain nemo doe not fly from
civilis sea and in some dai i think you can act with secur
ned land still look at me fixedli at length hi fix lip part
and he said it is for tonight
i drew myself up suddenli i wa i admit littl prepar for thi
commun i want to answer the canadian but word would not
come
we agre to wait for an opportun continu ned land and the
opportun ha arriv thi night we shall be but a few mile from
the spanish coast it is cloudi the wind blow freeli i have your
word m aronnax and i reli upon you
as i wa silent the canadian approach me
tonight at nine oclock said he i have warn conseil at that
moment captain nemo will be shut up in hi room probabl in bed
neither the engin nor the ship crew can see us conseil and i
will gain the central staircas and you m aronnax will remain in
the librari two step from us wait my signal the oar the mast
and the sail ar in the cano i have even succeed in get some
provis i have procur an english wrench to unfasten the bolt
which attach it to the shell of the nautilu so all is readi till
tonight
the sea is bad
that i allow repli the canadian but we must risk that liberti
is worth pai for besid the boat is strong and a few mile with
a fair wind to carri us is no great thing who know but by tomorrow
we mai be a hundr leagu awai let circumst onli favour us and
by ten or eleven oclock we shall have land on some spot of terra
firma aliv or dead but adieu now till tonight
with these word the canadian withdrew leav me almost dumb i had
imagin that the chanc gone i should have time to reflect and
discuss the matter my obstin companion had given me no time and
after all what could i have said to him ned land wa perfectli right
there wa almost the opportun to profit by could i retract my word
and take upon myself the respons of compromis the futur of
my companion tomorrow captain nemo might take us far from all land
at that moment a rather loud hiss nois told me that the reservoir
were fill and that the nautilu wa sink under the wave of
the atlant
a sad dai i pass between the desir of regain my liberti of
action and of abandon the wonder nautilu and leav my
submarin studi incomplet
what dread hour i pass thu sometim see myself and
companion safe land sometim wish in spite of my reason
that some unforeseen circumst would prevent the realis of ned
land project
twice i went to the saloon i wish to consult the compass i wish
to see if the direct the nautilu wa take wa bring us
nearer or take us farther from the coast but no the nautilu kept
in portugues water
i must therefor take my part and prepar for flight my luggag wa
not heavi my note noth more
as to captain nemo i ask myself what he would think of our escap
what troubl what wrong it might caus him and what he might do in
case of it discoveri or failur certainli i had no caus to complain
of him on the contrari never wa hospit freer than hi in
leav him i could not be tax with ingratitud no oath bound us to
him it wa on the strength of circumst he reli and not upon
our word to fix us for ever
i had not seen the captain sinc our visit to the island of santorin
would chanc bring me to hi presenc befor our departur i wish
it and i fear it at the same time i listen if i could hear him
walk the room contigu to mine no sound reach my ear i felt an
unbear uneasi thi dai of wait seem etern hour struck
too slowli to keep pace with my impati
my dinner wa serv in my room as usual i at but littl i wa too
preoccupi i left the tabl at seven oclock a hundr and twenti
minut i count them still separ me from the moment in which i
wa to join ned land my agit redoubl my puls beat violent
i could not remain quiet i went and came hope to calm my troubl
spirit by constant movement the idea of failur in our bold enterpris
wa the least pain of my anxieti but the thought of see our
project discov befor leav the nautilu of be brought
befor captain nemo irrit or what wa wors sadden at my
desert made my heart beat
i want to see the saloon for the last time i descend the stair
and arriv in the museum where i had pass so mani us and
agreeabl hour i look at all it rich all it treasur like a
man on the ev of an etern exil who wa leav never to return
these wonder of natur these masterpiec of art amongst which for
so mani dai my life had been concentr i wa go to abandon them
for ever i should like to have taken a last look through the window
of the saloon into the water of the atlant but the panel were
hermet close and a cloak of steel separ me from that ocean
which i had not yet explor
in pass through the saloon i came near the door let into the angl
which open into the captain room to my great surpris thi door
wa ajar i drew back involuntarili if captain nemo should be in hi
room he could see me but hear no sound i drew nearer the room
wa desert i push open the door and took some step forward still
the same monklik sever of aspect
suddenli the clock struck eight the first beat of the hammer on the
bell awok me from my dream i trembl as if an invis ey had
plung into my most secret thought and i hurri from the room
there my ey fell upon the compass our cours wa still north the log
indic moder speed the manomet a depth of about sixti feet
i return to my room cloth myself warmlysea boot an otterskin
cap a great coat of byssu line with sealskin i wa readi i wa
wait the vibrat of the screw alon broke the deep silenc which
reign on board i listen attent would no loud voic suddenli
inform me that ned land had been surpris in hi project flight a
mortal dread hung over me and i vainli tri to regain my accustom
cool
at a few minut to nine i put my ear to the captain door no nois
i left my room and return to the saloon which wa half in obscur
but desert
i open the door commun with the librari the same insuffici
light the same solitud i place myself near the door lead to the
central staircas and there wait for ned land signal
at that moment the trembl of the screw sensibl diminish then it
stop entir the silenc wa now onli disturb by the beat of
my own heart suddenli a slight shock wa felt and i knew that the
nautilu had stop at the bottom of the ocean my uneasi
increas the canadian signal did not come i felt inclin to join
ned land and beg of him to put off hi attempt i felt that we were not
sail under our usual condit
at thi moment the door of the larg saloon open and captain nemo
appear he saw me and without further preambl began in an amiabl
tone of voic
ah sir i have been look for you do you know the histori of
spain
now on might know the histori of on own countri by heart but in
the condit i wa at the time with troubl mind and head quit
lost i could not have said a word of it
well continu captain nemo you heard my question do you know the
histori of spain
veri slightli i answer
well here ar learn men have to learn said the captain come
sit down and i will tell you a curiou episod in thi histori sir
listen well said he thi histori will interest you on on side for
it will answer a question which doubtless you have not been abl to

drive at and ask myself if thi incid wa bear on our
project flight
sir if you have no object we will go back to 1702 you cannot be
ignor that your king loui xiv think that the gestur of a
potent wa suffici to bring the pyrene under hi yoke had
impos the duke of anjou hi grandson on the spaniard thi princ
reign more or less badli under the name of philip v and had a strong
parti against him abroad inde the preced year the royal hous
of holland austria and england had conclud a treati of allianc at
the hagu with the intent of pluck the crown of spain from the
head of philip v and place it on that of an archduk to whom thei
prematur gave the titl of charl iii
spain must resist thi coalit but she wa almost entir
unprovid with either soldier or sailor howev monei would not
fail them provid that their galleon laden with gold and silver
from america onc enter their port and about the end of 1702 thei
expect a rich convoi which franc wa escort with a fleet of
twentythre vessel command by admir chateaurenaud for the
ship of the coalit were alreadi beat the atlant thi convoi
wa to go to cadiz but the admir hear that an english fleet wa
cruis in those water resolv to make for a french port
the spanish command of the convoi object to thi decis thei
want to be taken to a spanish port and if not to cadiz into vigo
bai situat on the northwest coast of spain and which wa not
block
admir chateaurenaud had the rash to obei thi injunct and
the galleon enter vigo bai
unfortun it form an open road which could not be defend in
ani wai thei must therefor hasten to unload the galleon befor the
arriv of the combin fleet and time would not have fail them had
not a miser question of rivalri suddenli arisen
you ar follow the chain of event ask captain nemo
perfectli said i not know the end propos by thi histor
lesson
i will continu thi is what pass the merchant of cadiz had a
privileg by which thei had the right of receiv all merchandis
come from the west indi now to disembark these ingot at the port
of vigo wa depriv them of their right thei complain at madrid
and obtain the consent of the weakmind philip that the convoi
without discharg it cargo should remain sequest in the road
of vigo until the enemi had disappear
but whilst come to thi decis on the 22nd of octob 1702 the
english vessel arriv in vigo bai when admir chateaurenaud in
spite of inferior forc fought brave but see that the treasur
must fall into the enemi hand he burnt and scuttl everi galleon
which went to the bottom with their immens rich
captain nemo stop i admit i could not see yet why thi histori
should interest me
well i ask
well m aronnax repli captain nemo we ar in that vigo bai and
it rest with yourself whether you will penetr it mysteri
the captain rose tell me to follow him i had had time to recov
i obei the saloon wa dark but through the transpar glass the
wave were sparkl i look
for half a mile around the nautilu the water seem bath in
electr light the sandi bottom wa clean and bright some of the
ship crew in their divingdress were clear awai halfrotten
barrel and empti case from the midst of the blacken wreck from
these case and from these barrel escap ingot of gold and silver
cascad of piastr and jewel the sand wa heap up with them
laden with their preciou booti the men return to the nautilu
dispos of their burden and went back to thi inexhaust fisheri
of gold and silver
i understood now thi wa the scene of the battl of the 22nd of
octob 1702 here on thi veri spot the galleon laden for the
spanish govern had sunk here captain nemo came accord to hi
want to pack up those million with which he burden the nautilu
it wa for him and him alon america had given up her preciou metal
he wa heir direct without anyon to share in those treasur torn
from the inca and from the conquer of ferdinand cortez
did you know sir he ask smile that the sea contain such
rich
i knew i answer that thei valu monei held in suspens in
these water at two million
doubtless but to extract thi monei the expens would be greater than
the profit here on the contrari i have but to pick up what man ha
lostand not onli in vigo bai but in a thousand other port where
shipwreck have happen and which ar mark on my submarin map can
you understand now the sourc of the million i am worth
i understand captain but allow me to tell you that in explor vigo
bai you have onli been beforehand with a rival societi
and which
a societi which ha receiv from the spanish govern the privileg
of seek those buri galleon the sharehold ar led on by the
allur of an enorm bounti for thei valu these rich shipwreck
at five hundr million
five hundr million thei were answer captain nemo but thei ar
so no longer
just so said i and a warn to those sharehold would be an act
of chariti but who know if it would be well receiv what gambler
usual regret abov all is less the loss of their monei than of their
foolish hope after all i piti them less than the thousand of
unfortun to whom so much rich welldistribut would have been
profit whilst for them thei will be for ever barren
i had no sooner express thi regret than i felt that it must have
wound captain nemo
barren he exclaim with anim do you think then sir that
these rich ar lost becaus i gather them is it for myself alon
accord to your idea that i take the troubl to collect these
treasur who told you that i did not make a good us of it do you
think i am ignor that there ar suffer be and oppress race
on thi earth miser creatur to consol victim to aveng do
you not understand
captain nemo stop at these last word regret perhap that he
had spoken so much but i had guess that whatev the motiv which
had forc him to seek independ under the sea it had left him
still a man that hi heart still beat for the suffer of human
and that hi immens chariti wa for oppress race as well as
individu and i then understood for whom those million were
destin which were forward by captain nemo when the nautilu wa
cruis in the water of crete
chapter ix
a vanish contin
the next morn the 19th of februari i saw the canadian enter my
room i expect thi visit he look veri disappoint
well sir said he
well ned fortun wa against us yesterdai
ye that captain must need stop exactli at the hour we intend
leav hi vessel
ye ned he had busi at hi banker
hi banker
or rather hi bankinghous by that i mean the ocean where hi
rich ar safer than in the chest of the state
i then relat to the canadian the incid of the preced night
hope to bring him back to the idea of not abandon the captain but
my recit had no other result than an energet express regret
from ned that he had not been abl to take a walk on the battlefield of
vigo on hi own account
howev said he all is not end it is onli a blow of the harpoon
lost anoth time we must succe and tonight if necessari
in what direct is the nautilu go i ask
i do not know repli ned
well at noon we shall see the point
the canadian return to conseil as soon as i wa dress i went into
the saloon the compass wa not reassur the cours of the
nautilu wa ssw we were turn our back on europ
i wait with some impati till the ship place wa prick on the
chart at about halfpast eleven the reservoir were empti and our
vessel rose to the surfac of the ocean i rush toward the platform
ned land had preced me no more land in sight noth but an immens
sea some sail on the horizon doubtless those go to san roqu in
search of favour wind for doubl the cape of good hope the
weather wa cloudi a gale of wind wa prepar ned rave and tri
to pierc the cloudi horizon he still hope that behind all that fog
stretch the land he so long for
at noon the sun show itself for an instant the second profit by
thi bright to take it height then the sea becom more
billowi we descend and the panel close
an hour after upon consult the chart i saw the posit of the
nautilu wa mark at 16 17 long and 33 22 lat at 150
leagu from the nearest coast there wa no mean of flight and i
leav you to imagin the rage of the canadian when i inform him of
our situat
for myself i wa not particularli sorri i felt lighten of the load
which had oppress me and wa abl to return with some degre of
calm to my accustom work
that night about eleven oclock i receiv a most unexpect visit
from captain nemo he ask me veri gracious if i felt fatigu from
my watch of the preced night i answer in the neg
then m aronnax i propos a curiou excurs
propos captain
you have hitherto onli visit the submarin depth by daylight under
the bright of the sun would it suit you to see them in the
dark of the night
most willingli
i warn you the wai will be tire we shall have far to walk and
must climb a mountain the road ar not well kept
what you sai captain onli heighten my curios i am readi to
follow you
come then sir we will put on our divingdress
arriv at the robingroom i saw that neither of my companion nor ani
of the ship crew were to follow us on thi excurs captain nemo
had not even propos my take with me either ned or conseil
in a few moment we had put on our divingdress thei place on our
back the reservoir abundantli fill with air but no electr lamp
were prepar i call the captain attent to the fact
thei will be useless he repli
i thought i had not heard aright but i could not repeat my
observ for the captain head had alreadi disappear in it
metal case i finish har myself i felt them put an
ironpoint stick into my hand and some minut later after go
through the usual form we set foot on the bottom of the atlant at a
depth of 150 fathom midnight wa near the water were profoundli
dark but captain nemo point out in the distanc a reddish spot a
sort of larg light shine brilliantli about two mile from the
nautilu what thi fire might be what could feed it why and how it
lit up the liquid mass i could not sai in ani case it did light our
wai vagu it is true but i soon accustom myself to the peculiar
dark and i understood under such circumst the useless
of the ruhmkorff apparatu
as we advanc i heard a kind of patter abov my head the nois
redoubl sometim produc a continu shower i soon understood
the caus it wa rain fall violent and crisp the surfac of
the wave instinct the thought flash across my mind that i
should be wet through by the water in the midst of the water i could
not help laugh at the odd idea but inde in the thick
divingdress the liquid element is no longer felt and on onli seem
to be in an atmospher somewhat denser than the terrestri atmospher
noth more
after half an hour walk the soil becam stoni medusa microscop
crustacea and pennatul lit it slightli with their phosphoresc
gleam i caught a glimps of piec of stone cover with million of
zoophyt and mass of sea weed my feet often slip upon thi
sticki carpet of sea weed and without my irontip stick i should
have fallen more than onc in turn round i could still see the
whitish lantern of the nautilu begin to pale in the distanc
but the rosi light which guid us increas and lit up the horizon
the presenc of thi fire under water puzzl me in the highest degre
wa i go toward a natur phenomenon as yet unknown to the
savant of the earth or even for thi thought cross my brain had
the hand of man aught to do with thi conflagr had he fan thi
flame wa i to meet in these depth companion and friend of captain
nemo whom he wa go to visit and who like him led thi strang
exist should i find down there a whole coloni of exil who weari
of the miseri of thi earth had sought and found independ in the
deep ocean all these foolish and unreason idea pursu me and in
thi condit of mind overexcit by the success of wonder
continu pass befor my ey i should not have been surpris to
meet at the bottom of the sea on of those submarin town of which
captain nemo dream
our road grew lighter and lighter the white glimmer came in rai from
the summit of a mountain about 800 feet high but what i saw wa simpli
a reflect develop by the clear of the water the sourc of
thi inexplic light wa a fire on the opposit side of the
mountain
in the midst of thi stoni maze furrow the bottom of the atlant
captain nemo advanc without hesit he knew thi dreari road
doubtless he had often travel over it and could not lose himself i
follow him with unshaken confid he seem to me like a geni of
the sea and as he walk befor me i could not help admir hi
statur which wa outlin in black on the lumin horizon
it wa on in the morn when we arriv at the first slope of the
mountain but to gain access to them we must ventur through the
difficult path of a vast cops
ye a cops of dead tree without leav without sap tree
petrifi by the action of the water and here and there overtop by
gigant pine it wa like a coalpit still stand hold by the
root to the broken soil and whose branch like fine black paper
cut show distinctli on the wateri ceil pictur to yourself
a forest in the hartz hang on to the side of the mountain but a
forest swallow up the path were encumb with seawe and fucu
between which grovel a whole world of crustacea i went along
climb the rock stride over extend trunk break the sea
bindwe which hung from on tree to the other and frighten the
fish which flew from branch to branch press onward i felt no
fatigu i follow my guid who wa never tire what a spectacl
how can i express it how paint the aspect of those wood and rock in
thi mediumtheir under part dark and wild the upper colour with
red tint by that light which the reflect power of the water
doubl we climb rock which fell directli after with gigant
bound and the low growl of an avalanch to right and left ran
long dark galleri where sight wa lost here open vast glade
which the hand of man seem to have work and i sometim ask
myself if some inhabit of these submarin region would not suddenli
appear to me
but captain nemo wa still mount i could not stai behind i
follow boldli my stick gave me good help a fals step would have
been danger on the narrow pass slope down to the side of the
gulf but i walk with firm step without feel ani giddi now
i jump a crevic the depth of which would have made me hesit had
it been among the glacier on the land now i ventur on the unsteadi
trunk of a tree thrown across from on abyss to the other without
look under my feet have onli ey to admir the wild site of
thi region
there monument rock lean on their regularlycut base seem
to defi all law of equilibrium from between their stoni knee tree
sprang like a jet under heavi pressur and upheld other which upheld
them natur tower larg scarp cut perpendicularli like a
curtain inclin at an angl which the law of gravit could
never have toler in terrestri region
two hour after quit the nautilu we had cross the line of
tree and a hundr feet abov our head rose the top of the mountain
which cast a shadow on the brilliant irradi of the opposit slope
some petrifi shrub ran fantast here and there fish got up
under our feet like bird in the long grass the massiv rock were
rent with impenetr fractur deep grotto and unfathom hole
at the bottom of which formid creatur might be heard move my
blood curdl when i saw enorm antenna block my road or some
fright claw close with a nois in the shadow of some caviti
million of lumin spot shone brightli in the midst of the dark
thei were the ey of giant crustacea crouch in their hole giant
lobster set themselv up like halberdi and move their claw
with the click sound of pincer titan crab point like a gun
on it carriag and frightfullook poulp interweav their
tentacl like a live nest of serpent
we had now arriv on the first platform where other surpris await
me befor us lai some picturesqu ruin which betrai the hand of
man and not that of the creator there were vast heap of stone
amongst which might be trace the vagu and shadowi form of castl
and templ cloth with a world of blossom zoophyt and over
which instead of ivi seawe and fucu threw a thick veget
mantl but what wa thi portion of the globe which had been swallow
by cataclysm who had place those rock and stone like cromlech of
prehistor time where wa i whither had captain nemo fanci
hurri me
i would fain have ask him not be abl to i stop himi seiz
hi arm but shake hi head and point to the highest point of
the mountain he seem to sai
come come along come higher
i follow and in a few minut i had climb to the top which for a
circl of ten yard command the whole mass of rock
i look down the side we had just climb the mountain did not rise
more than seven or eight hundr feet abov the level of the plain but
on the opposit side it command from twice that height the depth of
thi part of the atlant my ey rang far over a larg space lit by
a violent fulgur in fact the mountain wa a volcano
at fifti feet abov the peak in the midst of a rain of stone and
scoria a larg crater wa vomit forth torrent of lava which fell
in a cascad of fire into the bosom of the liquid mass thu situat
thi volcano lit the lower plain like an immens torch even to the
extrem limit of the horizon i said that the submarin crater threw
up lava but no flame flame requir the oxygen of the air to feed
upon and cannot be develop under water but stream of lava have
in themselv the principl of their incandesc can attain a white
heat fight vigor against the liquid element and turn it to
vapour by contact
rapid current bear all these gase in diffus and torrent of
lava slid to the bottom of the mountain like an erupt of vesuviu on
anoth terra del greco
there inde under my ey ruin destroi lai a townit roof
open to the sky it templ fallen it arch disloc it column
ly on the ground from which on would still recognis the massiv
charact of tuscan architectur further on some remain of a
gigant aqueduct here the high base of an acropoli with the
float outlin of a parthenon there trace of a quai as if an
ancient port had formerli abut on the border of the ocean and
disappear with it merchant vessel and it wargallei farther on
again long line of sunken wall and broad desert streetsa perfect
pompeii escap beneath the water such wa the sight that captain
nemo brought befor my ey
where wa i where wa i i must know at ani cost i tri to speak
but captain nemo stop me by a gestur and pick up a piec of
chalkston advanc to a rock of black basalt and trace the on
word
atlanti
what a light shot through my mind atlanti the atlanti of plato
that contin deni by origen and humbolt who place it
disappear amongst the legendari tale i had it there now befor my
ey bear upon it the unexception testimoni of it catastroph
the region thu engulf wa beyond europ asia and lybia beyond the
column of hercul where those power peopl the atlantid
live against whom the first war of ancient greek were wage
thu led by the strangest destini i wa tread under foot the
mountain of thi contin touch with my hand those ruin a
thousand gener old and contemporari with the geolog epoch i
wa walk on the veri spot where the contemporari of the first man
had walk
whilst i wa try to fix in my mind everi detail of thi grand
landscap captain nemo remain motionless as if petrifi in mute
ecstasi lean on a mossi stone wa he dream of those gener
long sinc disappear wa he ask them the secret of human destini
wa it here thi strang man came to steep himself in histor
recollect and live again thi ancient lifeh who want no modern
on what would i not have given to know hi thought to share them
to understand them we remain for an hour at thi place
contempl the vast plain under the bright of the lava which
wa some time wonderfulli intens rapid trembl ran along the
mountain caus by intern bubbl deep nois distinctli
transmit through the liquid medium were echo with majest
grandeur at thi moment the moon appear through the mass of water
and threw her pale rai on the buri contin it wa but a gleam
but what an indescrib effect the captain rose cast on last look
on the immens plain and then bade me follow him
we descend the mountain rapidli and the miner forest onc pass
i saw the lantern of the nautilu shine like a star the captain
walk straight to it and we got on board as the first rai of light
whiten the surfac of the ocean
chapter x
the submarin coalmin
the next dai the 20th of februari i awok veri late the fatigu of
the previou night had prolong my sleep until eleven oclock i
dress quickli and hasten to find the cours the nautilu wa
take the instrument show it to be still toward the south with a
speed of twenti mile an hour and a depth of fifti fathom
the speci of fish here did not differ much from those alreadi
notic there were rai of giant size five yard long and endow
with great muscular strength which enabl them to shoot abov the
wave shark of mani kind amongst other on fifteen feet long
with triangular sharp teeth and whose transpar render it almost
invis in the water
amongst boni fish conseil notic some about three yard long arm at
the upper jaw with a pierc sword other brightcolour creatur
known in the time of aristotl by the name of the seadragon which ar
danger to captur on account of the spike on their back
about four oclock the soil gener compos of a thick mud mix
with petrifi wood chang by degre and it becam more stoni and
seem strewn with conglomer and piec of basalt with a sprinkl
of lava i thought that a mountain region wa succeed the long
plain and accordingli after a few evolut of the nautilu i
saw the southerli horizon block by a high wall which seem to close
all exit it summit evid pass the level of the ocean it must
be a contin or at least an islandon of the canari or of the
cape verd island the bear not be yet taken perhap
designedli i wa ignor of our exact posit in ani case such a
wall seem to me to mark the limit of that atlanti of which we had
in realiti pass over onli the smallest part
much longer should i have remain at the window admir the beauti
of sea and sky but the panel close at thi moment the nautilu
arriv at the side of thi high perpendicular wall what it would do
i could not guess i return to my room it no longer move i laid
myself down with the full intent of wake after a few hour sleep
but it wa eight oclock the next dai when i enter the saloon i
look at the manomet it told me that the nautilu wa float on
the surfac of the ocean besid i heard step on the platform i
went to the panel it wa open but instead of broad daylight as i
expect i wa surround by profound dark where were we wa i
mistaken wa it still night no not a star wa shine and night ha
not that utter dark
illustr the nautilu wa float near a mountain
i knew not what to think when a voic near me said
is that you professor
ah captain i answer where ar we
underground sir
underground i exclaim and the nautilu float still
it alwai float
but i do not understand
wait a few minut our lantern will be lit and if you like light
place you will be satisfi
i stood on the platform and wait the dark wa so complet that i
could not even see captain nemo but look to the zenith exactli
abov my head i seem to catch an undecid gleam a kind of twilight
fill a circular hole at thi instant the lantern wa lit and it
vivid dispel the faint light i close my dazzl ey for an
instant and then look again the nautilu wa stationari float
near a mountain which form a sort of quai the lake then support
it wa a lake imprison by a circl of wall measur two mile in
diamet and six in circumfer it level the manomet show
could onli be the same as the outsid level for there must necessarili
be a commun between the lake and the sea the high partit
lean forward on their base grew into a vault roof bear the
shape of an immens funnel turn upsid down the height be about
five or six hundr yard at the summit wa a circular orific by
which i had caught the slight gleam of light evid daylight
where ar we i ask
in the veri heart of an extinct volcano the interior of which ha
been invad by the sea after some great convuls of the earth
whilst you were sleep professor the nautilu penetr to thi
lagoon by a natur canal which open about ten yard beneath the
surfac of the ocean thi is it harbour of refug a sure
commodi and mysteri on shelter from all gale show me if
you can on the coast of ani of your contin or island a road
which can give such perfect refug from all storm
certainli i repli you ar in safeti here captain nemo who
could reach you in the heart of a volcano but did i not see an open
at it summit
ye it crater formerli fill with lava vapour and flame and
which now give entranc to the lifegiv air we breath
but what is thi volcan mountain
it belong to on of the numer island with which thi sea is
strewnto vessel a simpl sandbankto us an immens cavern chanc led
me to discov it and chanc serv me well
but of what us is thi refug captain the nautilu want no
port
no sir but it want electr to make it move and the wherewith
to make the electricitysodium to feed the element coal from which to
get the sodium and a coalmin to suppli the coal and exactli on thi
spot the sea cover entir forest embed dure the geolog
period now mineralis and transform into coal for me thei ar an
inexhaust mine
your men follow the trade of miner here then captain
exactli so these mine extend under the wave like the mine of
newcastl here in their divingdress pick ax and shovel in hand
my men extract the coal which i do not even ask from the mine of the
earth when i burn thi combust for the manufactur of sodium the
smoke escap from the crater of the mountain give it the
appear of a stillact volcano
and we shall see your companion at work
no not thi time at least for i am in a hurri to continu our
submarin tour of the earth so i shall content myself with draw
from the reserv of sodium i alreadi possess the time for load is
on dai onli and we continu our voyag so if you wish to go over
the cavern and make the round of the lagoon you must take advantag of
todai m aronnax
i thank the captain and went to look for my companion who had not
yet left their cabin i invit them to follow me without sai where
we were thei mount the platform conseil who wa astonish at
noth seem to look upon it as quit natur that he should wake
under a mountain after have fallen asleep under the wave but ned
land thought of noth but find whether the cavern had ani exit
after breakfast about ten oclock we went down on to the mountain
here we ar onc more on land said conseil
i do not call thi land said the canadian and besid we ar not
on it but beneath it
between the wall of the mountain and the water of the lake lai a
sandi shore which at it greatest breadth measur five hundr feet
on thi soil on might easili make the tour of the lake but the base
of the high partit wa stoni ground with volcan lock and
enorm pumiceston ly in picturesqu heap all these detach
mass cover with enamel polish by the action of the
subterran fire shone resplend by the light of our electr
lantern the mica dust from the shore rise under our feet flew like
a cloud of spark the bottom now rose sensibl and we soon arriv at
long circuit slope or inclin plane which took us higher by
degre but we were oblig to walk carefulli among these
conglomer bound by no cement the feet slip on the glassi
crystal felspar and quartz
the volcan natur of thi enorm excav wa confirm on all
side and i point it out to my companion
pictur to yourselv said i what thi crater must have been when
fill with boil lava and when the level of the incandesc liquid
rose to the orific of the mountain as though melt on the top of a
hot plate
i can pictur it perfectli said conseil but sir will you tell me
why the great architect ha suspend oper and how it is that
the furnac is replac by the quiet water of the lake
most probabl conseil becaus some convuls beneath the ocean
produc that veri open which ha serv as a passag for the
nautilu then the water of the atlant rush into the interior of
the mountain there must have been a terribl struggl between the two
element a struggl which end in the victori of neptun but mani
ag have run out sinc then and the submerg volcano is now a
peaceabl grotto
veri well repli ned land i accept the explan sir but in
our own interest i regret that the open of which you speak wa not
made abov the level of the sea
but friend ned said conseil if the passag had not been under the
sea the nautilu could not have gone through it
we continu ascend the step becam more and more perpendicular
and narrow deep excav which we were oblig to cross cut them
here and there slope mass had to be turn we slid upon our knee
and crawl along but conseil dexter and the canadian strength
surmount all obstacl at a height of about 31 feet the natur of
the ground chang without becom more practic to the
conglomer and trachyt succeed black basalt the first dispread in
layer full of bubbl the latter form regular prism place like
a colonnad support the spring of the immens vault an admir
specimen of natur architectur between the block of basalt wound
long stream of lava long sinc grown cold encrust with bitumin
rai and in some place there were spread larg carpet of sulphur a
more power light shone through the upper crater shed a vagu
glimmer over these volcan depress for ever buri in the bosom of
thi extinguish mountain but our upward march wa soon stop at a
height of about two hundr and fifti feet by impass obstacl
there wa a complet vault arch overhang us and our ascent wa
chang to a circular walk at the last chang veget life began to
struggl with the miner some shrub and even some tree grew from
the fractur of the wall i recognis some euphorbia with the
caustic sugar come from them heliotrop quit incap of
justifi their name sadli droop their cluster of flower both
their colour and perfum half gone here and there some chrysanthemum
grew timidli at the foot of an alo with long sicklylook leav
but between the stream of lava i saw some littl violet still
slightli perfum and i admit that i smelt them with delight perfum
is the soul of the flower and seaflow have no soul
we had arriv at the foot of some sturdi dragontre which had
push asid the rock with their strong root when ned land
exclaim
ah sir a hive a hive
a hive i repli with a gestur of incredul
ye a hive repeat the canadian and bee hum round it
i approach and wa bound to believ my own ey there at a hole
bore in on of the dragontre were some thousand of these ingeni
insect so common in all the canari and whose produc is so much
esteem natur enough the canadian wish to gather the honei
and i could not well oppos hi wish a quantiti of dry leav mix
with sulphur he lit with a spark from hi flint and he began to smoke
out the bee the hum ceas by degre and the hive eventu
yield sever pound of the sweetest honei with which ned land
fill hi haversack
when i have mix thi honei with the past of the breadfruit said
he i shall be abl to offer you a succul cake
transcrib note breadfruit ha been substitut for
artocarpu in thi ed
pon my word said conseil it will be gingerbread
never mind the gingerbread said i let us continu our interest
walk
at everi turn of the path we were follow the lake appear in all
it length and breadth the lantern lit up the whole of it peaceabl
surfac which knew neither rippl nor wave the nautilu remain
perfectli immov on the platform and on the mountain the ship
crew were work like black shadow clearli carv against the
lumin atmospher we were now go round the highest crest of the
first layer of rock which upheld the roof i then saw that bee were
not the onli repres of the anim kingdom in the interior of
thi volcano bird of prei hover here and there in the shadow or
fled from their nest on the top of the rock there were sparrow

that dai the nautilu cross a singular part of the atlant ocean
no on can be ignor of the exist of a current of warm water

to pass round it such wa the region the nautilu wa now visit
a perfect meadow a close carpet of seawe fucu and tropic
berri so thick and so compact that the stem of a vessel could hardli
tear it wai through it and captain nemo not wish to entangl hi
screw in thi herbac mass kept some yard beneath the surfac of

which signifi kelp thi kelp or berrypl is the princip

the scatter fragment will unit in a group in the centr of the

all the dai of the 22nd of februari we pass in the sargasso sea
where such fish as ar partial to marin plant find abund

from thi time for nineteen dai from the 23rd of februari to the 12th
of march the nautilu kept in the middl of the atlant carri
us at a constant speed of a hundr leagu in twentyfour hour
captain nemo evid intend accomplish hi submarin programm
and i imagin that he intend after doubl cape horn to return to
the australian sea of the pacif ned land had caus for fear in
these larg sea void of island we could not attempt to leav the
boat nor had we ani mean of oppos captain nemo will our onli
cours wa to submit but what we could neither gain by forc nor
cun i like to think might be obtain by persuas thi voyag
end would he not consent to restor our liberti under an oath never
to reveal hi existencean oath of honour which we should have
religi kept but we must consid that delic question with the
captain but wa i free to claim thi liberti had he not himself said
from the begin in the firmest manner that the secret of hi life
exact from him our last imprison on board the nautilu and
would not my four month silenc appear to him a tacit accept of
our situat and would not a return to the subject result in rais
suspicion which might be hurt to our project if at some futur
time a favour opportun offer to return to them
dure the nineteen dai mention abov no incid of ani kind
happen to signalis our voyag i saw littl of the captain he wa
at work in the librari i often found hi book left open especi
those on natur histori my work on submarin depth con over by
him wa cover with margin note often contradict my theori
and system but the captain content himself with thu purg my
work it wa veri rare for him to discuss it with me sometim i heard
the melancholi tone of hi organ but onli at night in the midst of
the deepest obscur when the nautilu slept upon the desert
ocean dure thi part of our voyag we sail whole dai on the
surfac of the wave the sea seem abandon a few sailingvessel
on the road to india were make for the cape of good hope on dai we
were follow by the boat of a whaler who no doubt took us for some
enorm whale of great price but captain nemo did not wish the worthi
fellow to lose their time and troubl so end the chase by plung
under the water our navig continu until the 13th of march that
dai the nautilu wa emploi in take sound which greatli
interest me we had then made about 13000 leagu sinc our
departur from the high sea of the pacif the bear gave us 45
37 s lat and 37 53 w long it wa the same water in which
captain denham of the herald sound 7000 fathom without find the
bottom there too lieuten parker of the american frigat
congress could not touch the bottom with 15140 fathom captain nemo
intend seek the bottom of the ocean by a diagon suffici
lengthen by mean of later plane place at an angl of 45 with
the waterlin of the nautilu then the screw set to work at it
maximum speed it four blade beat the wave with in describ
forc under thi power pressur the hull of the nautilu
quiver like a sonor chord and sank regularli under the water
at 7000 fathom i saw some blackish top rise from the midst of the
water but these summit might belong to high mountain like the
himalaya or mont blanc even higher and the depth of the abyss
remain incalcul the nautilu descend still lower in spite
of the great pressur i felt the steel plate trembl at the
fasten of the bolt it bar bent it partit groan the
window of the saloon seem to curv under the pressur of the water
and thi firm structur would doubtless have yield if as it
captain had said it had not been capabl of resist like a solid
block we had attain a depth of 16000 yard four leagu and the
side of the nautilu then bore a pressur of 1600 atmospher that
is to sai 3200 lb to each squar twofifth of an inch of it
surfac
what a situat to be in i exclaim to overrun these deep
region where man ha never trod look captain look at these
magnific rock these uninhabit grotto these lowest receptacl
of the globe where life is no longer possibl what unknown sight ar
here why should we be unabl to preserv a remembr of them
would you like to carri awai more than the remembr said captain
nemo
what do you mean by those word
i mean to sai that noth is easier than to make a photograph view
of thi submarin region
i had not time to express my surpris at thi new proposit when at
captain nemo call an object wa brought into the saloon through
the widelyopen panel the liquid mass wa bright with electr
which wa distribut with such uniform that not a shadow not a
gradat wa to be seen in our manufactur light the nautilu
remain motionless the forc of it screw subdu by the inclin
of it plane the instrument wa prop on the bottom of the ocean
site and in a few second we had obtain a perfect neg
but the oper be over captain nemo said let us go up we
must not abus our posit nor expos the nautilu too long to such
great pressur
go up again i exclaim
hold well on
i had not time to understand why the captain caution me thu when i
wa thrown forward on to the carpet at a signal from the captain it
screw wa ship and it blade rais vertic the nautilu
shot into the air like a balloon rise with stun rapid and
cut the mass of water with a sonor agit noth wa
visibl and in four minut it had shot through the four leagu which
separ it from the ocean and after emerg like a flyingfish
fell make the wave rebound to an enorm height
chapter xii
cachalot and whale
dure the night of the 13th and 14th of march the nautilu
return to it southerli cours i fanci that when on a level with
cape horn he would turn the helm westward in order to beat the
pacif sea and so complet the tour of the world he did noth of
the kind but continu on hi wai to the southern region where wa
he go to to the pole it wa mad i began to think that the
captain temer justifi ned land fear for some time past the
canadian had not spoken to me of hi project of flight he wa less
commun almost silent i could see that thi lengthen
imprison wa weigh upon him and i felt that rage wa burn
within him when he met the captain hi ey lit up with suppress
anger and i fear that hi natur violenc would lead him into some
extrem that dai the 14th of march conseil and he came to me in my
room i inquir the caus of their visit
a simpl question to ask you sir repli the canadian
speak ned
how mani men ar there on board the nautilu do you think
i cannot tell my friend
i should sai that it work doe not requir a larg crew
certainli under exist condit ten men at the most ought to
be enough
well why should there be ani more
why i repli look fixedli at ned land whose mean wa easi
to guess becaus i ad if my surmis ar correct and if i
have well understood the captain exist the nautilu is not
onli a vessel it is also a place of refug for those who like it
command have broken everi tie upon earth
perhap so said conseil but in ani case the nautilu can onli
contain a certain number of men could not you sir estim their
maximum
how conseil
by calcul given the size of the vessel which you know sir and
consequ the quantiti of air it contain know also how much
each man expend at a breath and compar these result with the fact
that the nautilu is oblig to go to the surfac everi twentyfour
hour
conseil had not finish the sentenc befor i saw what he wa drive
at
i understand said i but that calcul though simpl enough
can give but a veri uncertain result
never mind said ned land urgent
here it is then said i in on hour each man consum the oxygen
contain in twenti gallon of air and in twentyfour that contain
in 480 gallon we must therefor find how mani time 480 gallon of
air the nautilu contain
just so said conseil
or i continu the size of the nautilu be 1500 ton and
on ton hold 200 gallon it contain 300000 gallon of air which
divid by 480 give a quotient of 625 which mean to sai strictli
speak that the air contain in the nautilu would suffic for
625 men for twentyfour hour
six hundr and twentyf repeat ned
but rememb that all of us passeng sailor and offic
includ would not form a tenth part of that number
still too mani for three men murmur conseil
the canadian shook hi head pass hi hand across hi forehead and
left the room without answer
will you allow me to make on observ sir said conseil poor
ned is long for everyth that he can not have hi past life is
alwai present to him everyth that we ar forbidden he regret hi
head is full of old recollect and we must understand him what ha
he to do here noth he is not learn like you sir and ha not
the same tast for the beauti of the sea that we have he would risk
everyth to be abl to go onc more into a tavern in hi own
countri
certainli the monotoni on board must seem intoler to the canadian
accustom as he wa to a life of liberti and activ event were
rare which could rous him to ani show of spirit but that dai an event
did happen which recal the bright dai of the harpoon about
eleven in the morn be on the surfac of the ocean the
nautilu fell in with a troop of whalesan encount which did not
astonish me know that these creatur hunt to death had taken
refug in high latitud
we were seat on the platform with a quiet sea the month of octob
in those latitud gave us some love autumn dai it wa the
canadianh could not be mistakenwho signal a whale on the eastern
horizon look attent on might see it black back rise and
fall with the wave five mile from the nautilu
ah exclaim ned land if i wa on board a whaler now such a
meet would give me pleasur it is on of larg size see with what
strength it blowhol throw up column of air an steam confound it
why am i bound to these steel plate
what ned said i you have not forgotten your old idea of
fish
can a whalefish ever forget hi old trade sir can he ever tire of
the emot caus by such a chase
you have never fish in these sea ned
never sir in the northern onli and as much in behr as in davi
strait
then the southern whale is still unknown to you it is the greenland
whale you have hunt up to thi time and that would not risk pass
through the warm water of the equat whale ar localis accord
to their kind in certain sea which thei never leav and if on of
these creatur went from behr to davi strait it must be simpli
becaus there is a passag from on sea to the other either on the
american or the asiat side
in that case as i have never fish in these sea i do not know the
kind of whale frequent them
i have told you ned
a greater reason for make their acquaint said conseil
look look exclaim the canadian thei approach thei aggrav
me thei know that i cannot get at them
ned stamp hi feet hi hand trembl as he grasp an imaginari
harpoon
ar these cetacean as larg as those of the northern sea ask he
veri nearli ned
becaus i have seen larg whale sir whale measur a hundr
feet i have even been told that those of hullamoch and umgallick of
the aleutian island ar sometim a hundr and fifti feet long
that seem to me exagger these creatur ar onli
balaeaopteron provid with dorsal fin and like the cachalot ar
gener much smaller than the greenland whale
ah exclaim the canadian whose ey had never left the ocean
thei ar come nearer thei ar in the same water as the nautilu
then return to the convers he said
you spoke of the cachalot as a small creatur i have heard of
gigant on thei ar intellig cetacea it is said of some that
thei cover themselv with seawe and fucu and then ar taken for
island peopl encamp upon them and settl there light a fire
and build hous said conseil
ye joker said ned land and on fine dai the creatur plung
carri with it all the inhabit to the bottom of the sea
someth like the travel of sinbad the sailor i repli laugh
ah suddenli exclaim ned land it is not on whale there ar
tenther ar twentyit is a whole troop and i not abl to do
anyth hand and feet ti
but friend ned said conseil why do you not ask captain nemo
permiss to chase them
conseil had not finish hi sentenc when ned land had lower himself
through the panel to seek the captain a few minut afterward the two
appear togeth on the platform
captain nemo watch the troop of cetacea plai on the water about a
mile from the nautilu
thei ar southern whale said he there goe the fortun of a whole
fleet of whaler
well sir ask the canadian can i not chase them if onli to
remind me of my old trade of harpoon
and to what purpos repli captain nemo onli to destroi we have
noth to do with the whaleoil on board
but sir continu the canadian in the red sea you allow us to
follow the dugong
then it wa to procur fresh meat for my crew here it would be
kill for kill sake i know that is a privileg reserv for
man but i do not approv of such murder pastim in destroi the
southern whale like the greenland whale an inoffens creatur
your trader do a culpabl action master land thei have alreadi
depopul the whole of baffin bai and ar annihil a class of
us anim leav the unfortun cetacea alon thei have plenti
of natur enemiescachalot swordfish and sawfishwithout you
troubl them
the captain wa right the barbar and inconsider greed of these
fishermen will on dai caus the disappear of the last whale in the
ocean ned land whistl yankeedoodl between hi teeth thrust hi
hand into hi pocket and turn hi back upon us but captain nemo
watch the troop of cetacea and address me said
i wa right in sai that whale had natur enemi enough without
count man these will have plenti to do befor long do you see m
aronnax about eight mile to leeward those blackish move point
ye captain i repli
those ar cachalotsterr anim which i have met in troop of
two or three hundr as to those thei ar cruel mischiev
creatur thei would be right in extermin them
the canadian turn quickli at the last word
well captain said he it is still time in the interest of the
whale
it is useless to expos on self professor the nautilu will
dispers them it is arm with a steel spur as good as master land
harpoon i imagin
the canadian did not put himself out enough to shrug hi shoulder
attack cetacea with blow of a spur who had ever heard of such a
thing
wait m aronnax said captain nemo we will show you someth you
have never yet seen we have no piti for these feroci creatur
thei ar noth but mouth and teeth
mouth and teeth no on could better describ the macrocephal
cachalot which is sometim more than seventyf feet long it
enorm head occupi onethird of it entir bodi better arm than
the whale whose upper jaw is furnish onli with whalebon it is
suppli with twentyf larg tusk about eight inch long
cylindr and conic at the top each weigh two pound it is in
the upper part of thi enorm head in great caviti divid by
cartilag that is to be found from six to eight hundr pound of
that preciou oil call spermaceti the cachalot is a disagre
creatur more tadpol than fish accord to fredol descript it
is badli form the whole of it left side be if we mai sai it a
failur and be onli abl to see with it right ey but the
formid troop wa near us thei had seen the whale and were
prepar to attack them on could judg beforehand that the cachalot
would be victori not onli becaus thei were better built for attack
than their inoffens adversari but also becaus thei could remain
longer under water without come to the surfac there wa onli just
time to go to the help of the whale the nautilu went under water
conseil ned land and i took our place befor the window in the
saloon and captain nemo join the pilot in hi cage to work hi
apparatu as an engin of destruct soon i felt the beat of the
screw quicken and our speed increas the battl between the
cachalot and the whale had alreadi begun when the nautilu arriv
thei did not at first show ani fear at the sight of thi new monster
join in the conflict but thei soon had to guard against it blow
what a battl the nautilu wa noth but a formid harpoon
brandish by the hand of it captain it hurl itself against the
fleshi mass pass through from on part to the other leav behind
it two quiver halv of the anim it could not feel the formid
blow from their tail upon it side nor the shock which it produc
itself much more on cachalot kill it ran at the next tack on
the spot that it might not miss it prei go forward and backward
answer to it helm plung when the cetacean dive into the deep
water come up with it when it return to the surfac strike it
front or sidewai cut or tear in all direct and at ani
pace pierc it with it terribl spur what carnag what a nois on
the surfac of the wave what sharp hiss and what snort
peculiar to these enrag anim in the midst of these water
gener so peac their tail made perfect billow for on hour
thi wholesal massacr continu from which the cachalot could not
escap sever time ten or twelv unit tri to crush the
nautilu by their weight from the window we could see their enorm
mouth stud with tusk and their formid ey ned land could
not contain himself he threaten and swore at them we could feel
them cling to our vessel like dog worri a wild boar in a cops
but the nautilu work it screw carri them here and there or
to the upper level of the ocean without care for their enorm
weight nor the power strain on the vessel at length the mass of
cachalot broke up the wave becam quiet and i felt that we were
rise to the surfac the panel open and we hurri on to the
platform the sea wa cover with mutil bodi a formid
explos could not have divid and torn thi fleshi mass with more
violenc we were float amid gigant bodi bluish on the back and
white underneath cover with enorm protuber some terrifi
cachalot were fly toward the horizon the wave were dy red for
sever mile and the nautilu float in a sea of blood captain
nemo join us
well master land said he
well sir repli the canadian whose enthusiasm had somewhat
calm it is a terribl spectacl certainli but i am not a butcher
i am a hunter and i call thi a butcheri
it is a massacr of mischiev creatur repli the captain and
the nautilu is not a butcher knife
i like my harpoon better said the canadian
everi on to hi own answer the captain look fixedli at ned
land
i fear he would commit some act of violenc which would end in sad
consequ but hi anger wa turn by the sight of a whale which
the nautilu had just come up with the creatur had not quit
escap from the cachalot teeth i recognis the southern whale by
it flat head which is entir black anatom it is
distinguish from the white whale and the north cape whale by the
seven cervic vertebra and it ha two more rib than it congen
the unfortun cetacean wa ly on it side riddl with hole from
the bite and quit dead from it mutil fin still hung a young
whale which it could not save from the massacr it open mouth let the
water flow in and out murmur like the wave break on the shore
captain nemo steer close to the corps of the creatur two of hi
men mount it side and i saw not without surpris that thei were
draw from it breast all the milk which thei contain that is to
sai about two or three ton the captain offer me a cup of the milk
which wa still warm i could not help show my repugn to the
drink but he assur me that it wa excel and not to be
distinguish from cow milk i tast it and wa of hi opinion it
wa a us reserv to us for in the shape of salt butter or chees
it would form an agreeabl varieti from our ordinari food from that
dai i notic with uneasi that ned land illwil toward captain
nemo increas and i resolv to watch the canadian gestur

the iceberg
the nautilu wa steadili pursu it southerli cours follow
the fiftieth meridian with consider speed did he wish to reach the
pole i did not think so for everi attempt to reach that point had
hitherto fail again the season wa far advanc for in the
antarct region the 13th of march correspond with the 13th of
septemb of northern region which begin at the equinocti season
on the 14th of march i saw float ic in latitud 55 mere pale
bit of debri from twenti to twentyf feet long form bank over
which the sea curl the nautilu remain on the surfac of the
ocean ned land who had fish in the arctic sea wa familiar with
it iceberg but conseil and i admir them for the first time in the
atmospher toward the southern horizon stretch a white dazzl
band english whaler have given it the name of ic blink howev
thick the cloud mai be it is alwai visibl and announc the

of dai upon a thousand crystal facet other shade with vivid
calcar reflect resembl a perfect town of marbl the more we
near the south the more these float island increas both in
number and import
at 60 lat everi pass had disappear but seek carefulli captain
nemo soon found a narrow open through which he boldli slip
know howev that it would close behind him thu guid by thi
clever hand the nautilu pass through all the ic with a precis
which quit charm conseil iceberg or mountain icefield or
smooth plain seem to have no limit driftic or float
icepack plain broken up call palch when thei ar circular and
stream when thei ar made up of long strip the temperatur wa veri
low the thermomet expos to the air mark 2 deg or 3 below zero
but we were warmli clad with fur at the expens of the seabear and
seal the interior of the nautilu warm regularli by it electr
apparatu defi the most intens cold besid it would onli have
been necessari to go some yard beneath the wave to find a more
bearabl temperatur two month earlier we should have had perpetu
daylight in these latitud but alreadi we had had three or four hour
of night and by and by there would be six month of dark in these
circumpolar region on the 15th of march we were in the latitud of
new shetland and south orknei the captain told me that formerli
numer tribe of seal inhabit them but that english and american
whaler in their rage for destruct massacr both old and young
thu where there wa onc life and anim thei had left silenc
and death
about eight oclock on the morn of the 16th of march the nautilu
follow the fiftyfifth meridian cut the antarct polar circl ic
surround us on all side and close the horizon but captain nemo
went from on open to anoth still go higher i cannot express
my astonish at the beauti of these new region the ic took most
surpris form here the group form an orient town with
innumer mosqu and minaret there a fallen citi thrown to the
earth as it were by some convuls of natur the whole aspect wa

greyish fog amidst hurrican of snow deton and fall were heard
on all side great overthrow of iceberg which alter the whole
landscap like a diorama often see no exit i thought we were
definit prison but instinct guid him at the slightest
indic captain nemo would discov a new pass he wa never
mistaken when he saw the thin thread of bluish water trickl along
the icefield and i had no doubt that he had alreadi ventur into
the midst of these antarct sea befor on the 16th of march
howev the icefield absolut block our road it wa not the
iceberg itself as yet but vast field cement by the cold but thi
obstacl could not stop captain nemo he hurl himself against it with
fright violenc the nautilu enter the brittl mass like a
wedg and split it with fright crack it wa the batter ram
of the ancient hurl by infinit strength the ic thrown high in
the air fell like hail around us by it own power of impuls our
apparatu made a canal for itself some time carri awai by it own

sometim buri beneath it divid it by a simpl pitch movement
produc larg rent in it violent gale assail us at thi time
accompani by thick fog through which from on end of the platform
to the other we could see noth the wind blew sharpli from all
part of the compass and the snow lai in such hard heap that we had
to break it with blow of a pickax the temperatur wa alwai at 5
deg below zero everi outward part of the nautilu wa cover with

gorg a vessel without sail with electr for it motiv power
and want no coal could alon brave such high latitud at length
on the 18th of march after mani useless assault the nautilu wa
posit block it wa no longer either stream pack or
icefield but an intermin and immov barrier form by
mountain solder togeth
an iceberg said the canadian to me
i knew that to ned land as well as to all other navig who had
preced us thi wa an inevit obstacl the sun appear for an
instant at noon captain nemo took an observ as near as possibl
which gave our situat at 51 30 long and 67 39 of s lat we had
advanc on degre more in thi antarct region of the liquid
surfac of the sea there wa no longer a glimps under the spur of the
nautilu lai stretch a vast plain entangl with confus block
here and there sharp point and slender needl rise to a height of
200 feet further on a steep shore hewn as it were with an ax and
cloth with greyish tint huge mirror reflect a few rai of
sunshin half drown in the fog and over thi desol face of
natur a stern silenc reign scarc broken by the flap of the
wing of petrel and puffin everyth wa frozeneven the nois the
nautilu wa then oblig to stop in it adventur cours amid
these field of ic in spite of our effort in spite of the power
mean emploi to break up the ic the nautilu remain immov
gener when we can proce no further we have return still open to
us but here return wa as imposs as advanc for everi pass had
close behind us and for the few moment when we were stationari we
were like to be entir block which did inde happen about two
oclock in the afternoon the fresh ic form around it side with
astonish rapid i wa oblig to admit that captain nemo wa more
than imprud i wa on the platform at that moment the captain had
been observ our situat for some time past when he said to me
well sir what do you think of thi
i think that we ar caught captain
illustr the nautilu wa block up
so m aronnax you realli think that the nautilu cannot disengag
itself
with difficulti captain for the season is alreadi too far advanc
for you to reckon on the break of the ic
ah sir said captain nemo in an iron tone you will alwai be
the same you see noth but difficulti and obstacl i affirm that
not onli can the nautilu disengag itself but also that it can go
further still
further to the south i ask look at the captain
ye sir it shall go to the pole
to the pole i exclaim unabl to repress a gestur of incredul
ye repli the captain coldli to the antarct poleto that
unknown point from whenc spring everi meridian of the globe you know
whether i can do as i pleas with the nautilu
ye i knew that i knew that thi man wa bold even to rash but
to conquer those obstacl which bristl round the south pole
render it more inaccess than the north which had not yet been
reach by the boldest navigatorswa it not a mad enterpris on
which onli a maniac would have conceiv it then came into my head to
ask captain nemo if he had ever discov that pole which had never
yet been trodden by a human creatur
no sir he repli but we will discov it togeth where other
have fail i will not fail i have never yet led my nautilu so far
into southern sea but i repeat it shall go further yet
i can well believ you captain said i in a slightli iron tone
i believ you let us go ahead there ar no obstacl for us let us
smash thi iceberg let us blow it up and if it resist let us give
the nautilu wing to fly over it
over it sir said captain nemo quietli no not over it but under
it
under it i exclaim a sudden idea of the captain project
flash upon my mind i understood the wonder qualiti of the
nautilu were go to serv us in thi superhuman enterpris
i see we ar begin to understand on anoth sir said the
captain half smile you begin to see the possibilityi should sai
the successof thi attempt that which is imposs for an ordinari
vessel is easi to the nautilu if a contin li befor the pole
it must stop befor the contin but if on the contrari the pole is
wash by open sea it will go even to the pole
certainli said i carri awai by the captain reason if the
surfac of the sea is solidifi by the ic the lower depth ar free
by the providenti law which ha place the maximum of densiti of the
water of the ocean on degre higher than freezingpoint and if i am
not mistaken the portion of thi iceberg which is abov the water is
as on to four to that which is below
veri nearli sir for on foot of iceberg abov the sea there ar
three below it if these ic mountain ar not more than 300 feet abov
the surfac thei ar not more than 900 beneath and what ar 900 feet
to the nautilu
noth sir
it could even seek at greater depth that uniform temperatur of
seawat and there brave with impun the thirti or forti degre of
surfac cold
just so sirjust so i repli get anim
the onli difficulti continu captain nemo is that of remain
sever dai without renew our provis of air
is that all the nautilu ha vast reservoir we can fill them and
thei will suppli us with all the oxygen we want
well thought of m aronnax repli the captain smile but not
wish you to accus me of rash i will first give you all my
object
have you ani more to make
onli on it is possibl if the sea exist at the south pole that it
mai be cover and consequ we shall be unabl to come to the
surfac
good sir but do you forget that the nautilu is arm with a
power spur and could we not send it diagon against these field
of ic which would open at the shock
ah sir you ar full of idea todai
besid captain i ad enthusiast why should we not find
the sea open at the south pole as well as at the north the frozen
pole of the earth do not coincid either in the southern or in the
northern region and until it is prove to the contrari we mai
suppos either a contin or an ocean free from ic at these two
point of the globe
i think so too m aronnax repli captain nemo i onli wish you to
observ that after have made so mani object to my project you
ar now crush me with argument in it favour
the prepar for thi audaci attempt now began the power
pump of the nautilu were work air into the reservoir and
store it at high pressur about four oclock captain nemo announc
the close of the panel on the platform i threw on last look at the
massiv iceberg which we were go to cross the weather wa clear
the atmospher pure enough the cold veri great be 12 below zero
but the wind have gone down thi temperatur wa not so unbear
about ten men mount the side of the nautilu arm with pickax
to break the ic around the vessel which wa soon free the oper
wa quickli perform for the fresh ic wa still veri thin we all
went below the usual reservoir were fill with the newlyliber
water and the nautilu soon descend i had taken my place with
conseil in the saloon through the open window we could see the lower
bed of the southern ocean the thermomet went up the needl of the
compass deviat on the dial at about 900 feet as captain nemo had
foreseen we were float beneath the undul bottom of the
iceberg but the nautilu went lower stillit went to the depth of
four hundr fathom the temperatur of the water at the surfac
show twelv degre it wa now onli ten we had gain two i need
not sai the temperatur of the nautilu wa rais by it heat
apparatu to a much higher degre everi manuvr wa accomplish with
wonder precis
we shall pass it if you pleas sir said conseil
i believ we shall i said in a tone of firm convict
in thi open sea the nautilu had taken it cours direct to the
pole without leav the fiftysecond meridian from 67 30 to 90
deg twentytwo degre and a half of latitud remain to travel
that is about five hundr leagu the nautilu kept up a mean
speed of twentysix mile an hourth speed of an express train if
that wa kept up in forti hour we should reach the pole
for a part of the night the novelti of the situat kept us at the
window the sea wa lit with the electr lantern but it wa desert
fish did not sojourn in these imprison water thei onli found
there a passag to take them from the antarct ocean to the open polar
sea our pace wa rapid we could feel it by the quiver of the long
steel bodi about two in the morn i took some hour repos and
conseil did the same in cross the waist i did not meet captain
nemo i suppos him to be in the pilot cage the next morn the
19th of march i took my post onc more in the saloon the electr log
told me that the speed of the nautilu had been slacken it wa
then go toward the surfac but prudent empti it reservoir
veri slowli my heart beat fast were we go to emerg and regain the
open polar atmospher no a shock told me that the nautilu had
struck the bottom of the iceberg still veri thick judg from the
deaden sound we had in deed struck to us a sea express but
in an invers sens and at a thousand feet deep thi would give three
thousand feet of ic abov us on thousand be abov the watermark
the iceberg wa then higher than at it bordersnot a veri reassur
fact sever time that dai the nautilu tri again and everi time
it struck the wall which lai like a ceil abov it sometim it met
with but 900 yard onli 200 of which rose abov the surfac it wa
twice the height it wa when the nautilu had gone under the wave i
carefulli note the differ depth and thu obtain a submarin
profil of the chain as it wa develop under the water that night no
chang had taken place in our situat still ic between four and
five hundr yard in depth it wa evid diminish but still
what a thick between us and the surfac of the ocean it wa then
eight accord to the daili custom on board the nautilu it air
should have been renew four hour ago but i did not suffer much
although captain nemo had not yet made ani demand upon hi reserv of
oxygen my sleep wa pain that night hope and fear besieg me by
turn i rose sever time the grope of the nautilu continu
about three in the morn i notic that the lower surfac of the
iceberg wa onli about fifti feet deep on hundr and fifti feet now
separ us from the surfac of the water the iceberg wa by degre
becom an icefield the mountain a plain my ey never left the
manomet we were still rise diagon to the surfac which
sparkl under the electr rai the iceberg wa stretch both abov
and beneath into lengthen slope mile after mile it wa get
thinner at length at six in the morn of that memor dai the
19th of march the door of the saloon open and captain nemo
appear
the sea is open wa all he said
chapter xiv
the south pole
i rush on to the platform ye the open sea with but a few
scatter piec of ic and move icebergsa long stretch of sea a
world of bird in the air and myriad of fish under those water
which vari from intens blue to oliv green accord to the bottom
the thermomet mark 3 c abov zero it wa compar spring
shut up as we were behind thi iceberg whose lengthen mass wa dimli
seen on our northern horizon
ar we at the pole i ask the captain with a beat heart
i do not know he repli at noon i will take our bear
but will the sun show himself through thi fog said i look at
the leaden sky
howev littl it show it will be enough repli the captain
about ten mile south a solitari island rose to a height of on hundr
and four yard we made for it but carefulli for the sea might be
strewn with bank on hour afterward we had reach it two hour
later we had made the round of it it measur four or five mile in
circumfer a narrow canal separ it from a consider stretch
of land perhap a contin for we could not see it limit the
exist of thi land seem to give some colour to mauri theori
the ingeni american ha remark that between the south pole and
the sixtieth parallel the sea is cover with float ic of enorm
size which is never met with in the north atlant from thi fact he
ha drawn the conclus that the antarct circl enclos
consider contin as iceberg cannot form in open sea but onli
on the coast accord to these calcul the mass of ic
surround the southern pole form a vast cap the circumfer of
which must be at least 2500 mile but the nautilu for fear of
run aground had stop about three cablelength from a strand
over which rear a superb heap of rock the boat wa launch the
captain two of hi men bear instrument conseil and myself were
in it it wa ten in the morn i had not seen ned land doubtless
the canadian did not wish to admit the presenc of the south pole a
few stroke of the oar brought us to the sand where we ran ashor
conseil wa go to jump on to the land when i held him back
sir said i to captain nemo to you belong the honour of first
set foot on thi land
ye sir said the captain and if i do not hesit to tread thi
south pole it is becaus up to thi time no human be ha left a
trace there
sai thi he jump lightli on to the sand hi heart beat with
emot he climb a rock slope to a littl promontori and there
with hi arm cross mute and motionless and with an eager look he
seem to take possess of these southern region after five minut
pass in thi ecstasi he turn to us
when you like sir
i land follow by conseil leav the two men in the boat for a
long wai the soil wa compos of a reddish sandi stone someth like
crush brick scoria stream of lava and pumiceston on could
not mistak it volcan origin in some part slight curl of smoke
emit a sulphur smell prove that the intern fire had lost
noth of their expans power though have climb a high
accliv i could see no volcano for a radiu of sever mile we
know that in those antarct countri jame ross found two crater
the erebu and terror in full activ on the 167th meridian
latitud 77 32 the veget of thi desol contin seem to
me much restrict some lichen lai upon the black rock some
microscop plant rudimentari diatoma a kind of cell place
between two quartz shell long purpl and scarlet weed support on
littl swim bladder which the break of the wave brought to
the shore these constitut the meagr flora of thi region the shore
wa strewn with mollusc littl mussel and limpet i also saw
myriad of northern clio oneandaquart inch long of which a
whale would swallow a whole world at a mouth and some perfect
seabutterfli anim the water on the skirt of the shore
there appear on the high bottom some coral shrub of the kind
which accord to jame ross live in the antarct sea to the depth
of more than 1000 yard then there were littl kingfish and
starfish stud the soil but where life abound most wa in the
air there thousand of bird flutter and flew of all kind
deafen us with their cri other crowd the rock look at us
as we pass by without fear and press familiarli close by our
feet there were penguin so agil in the water heavi and awkward as
thei ar on the ground thei were utter harsh cri a larg
assembl sober in gestur but extravag in clamour albatross
pass in the air the expans of their wing be at least four yard
and a half and justli call the vultur of the ocean some gigant
petrel and some damier a kind of small duck the underpart of whose
bodi is black and white then there were a whole seri of petrel
some whitish with brownbord wing other blue peculiar to the
antarct sea and so oili as i told conseil that the inhabit of
the ferro island had noth to do befor light them but to put a
wick in
a littl more said conseil and thei would be perfect lamp after
that we cannot expect natur to have previous furnish them with
wick
about half a mile farther on the soil wa riddl with ruff nest a
sort of layingground out of which mani bird were issu captain
nemo had some hundr hunt thei utter a cry like the brai of
an ass were about the size of a goos slatecolour on the bodi white
beneath with a yellow line round their throat thei allow
themselv to be kill with a stone never try to escap but the
fog did not lift and at eleven the sun had not yet shown itself it
absenc made me uneasi without it no observ were possibl how
then could we decid whether we had reach the pole when i rejoin
captain nemo i found him lean on a piec of rock silent watch
the sky he seem impati and vex but what wa to be done thi
rash and power man could not command the sun as he did the sea noon
arriv without the orb of dai show itself for an instant we could
not even tell it posit behind the curtain of fog and soon the fog
turn to snow
till tomorrow said the captain quietli and we return to the
nautilu amid these atmospher disturb
the tempest of snow continu till the next dai it wa imposs to
remain on the platform from the saloon where i wa take note of
incid happen dure thi excurs to the polar contin i
could hear the cri of petrel and albatross sport in the midst
of thi violent storm the nautilu did not remain motionless but
skirt the coast advanc ten mile more to the south in the
halflight left by the sun as it skirt the edg of the horizon the
next dai the 20th of march the snow had ceas the cold wa a littl
greater the thermomet show 2 below zero the fog wa rise and
i hope that that dai our observ might be taken captain nemo not
have yet appear the boat took conseil and myself to land the soil
wa still of the same volcan natur everywher were trace of lava
scoria and basalt but the crater which had vomit them i could not
see here as lower down thi contin wa aliv with myriad of
bird but their rule wa now divid with larg troop of seamamm
look at us with their soft ey there were sever kind of seal
some stretch on the earth some on flake of ic mani go in and
out of the sea thei did not flee at our approach never have had
anyth to do with man and i reckon that there were provis
there for hundr of vessel
sir said conseil will you tell me the name of these creatur
thei ar seal and mors
it wa now eight in the morn four hour remain to us befor the
sun could be observ with advantag i direct our step toward a
vast bai cut in the steep granit shore there i can aver that earth
and ic were lost to sight by the number of seamamm cover them
and i involuntarili sought for old proteu the mytholog shepherd
who watch these immens flock of neptun there were more seal than
anyth els form distinct group male and femal the father
watch over hi famili the mother suckl her littl on some

their place thei took littl jump made by the contract of their

with the lamantin their cousin form a perfect forearm i should sai
that in the water which is their elementth spine of these creatur
is flexibl with smooth and close skin and web feetthei swim

attitud thu the ancient observ their soft and express
look which cannot be surpass by the most beauti look a woman can
give their clear voluptu ey their charm posit and the
poetri of their manner metamorphos them the male into a triton and
the femal into a mermaid i made conseil notic the consider
develop of the lobe of the brain in these interest cetacean
no mammal except man ha such a quantiti of brain matter thei ar
also capabl of receiv a certain amount of educ ar easili
domest and i think with other naturalist that if properli
taught thei would be of great servic as fishingdog the greater part
of them slept on the rock or on the sand amongst these seal
properli so call which have no extern ear in which thei differ
from the otter whose ear ar promin i notic sever varieti
of seal about three yard long with a white coat bulldog head
arm with teeth in both jaw four incisor at the top and four at the

amongst them glide seaeleph a kind of seal with short flexibl
trunk the giant of thi speci measur twenti feet round and ten
yard and a half in length but thei did not move as we approach
these creatur ar not danger ask conseil
no not unless you attack them when thei have to defend their young
their rage is terribl and it is not uncommon for them to break the
fishingboat to piec
thei ar quit right said conseil
i do not sai thei ar not
two mile farther on we were stop by the promontori which shelter
the bai from the southerli wind beyond it we heard loud bellow
such as a troop of rumin would produc
good said conseil a concert of bull
no a concert of mors
thei ar fight
thei ar either fight or plai
we now began to climb the blackish rock amid unforeseen stumbl and
over stone which the ic made slipperi more than onc i roll over
at the expens of my loin conseil more prudent or more steadi did
not stumbl and help me up sai
if sir you would have the kind to take wider step you would
preserv your equilibrium better
arriv at the upper ridg of the promontori i saw a vast white plain
cover with mors thei were plai amongst themselv and what we
heard were bellow of pleasur not of anger
as i pass these curiou anim i could examin them leisur for
thei did not move their skin were thick and rug of a yellowish
tint approach to red their hair wa short and scant some of them
were four yard and a quarter long quieter and less timid than their
cousin of the north thei did not like them place sentinel round
the outskirt of their encamp after examin thi citi of mors
i began to think of return it wa eleven oclock and if captain
nemo found the condit favour for observ i wish to be
present at the oper we follow a narrow pathwai run along
the summit of the steep shore at halfpast eleven we had reach the
place where we land the boat had run aground bring the captain
i saw him stand on a block of basalt hi instrument near him hi
ey fix on the northern horizon near which the sun wa then
describ a lengthen curv i took my place besid him and wait
without speak noon arriv and as befor the sun did not appear
it wa a fatal observ were still want if not accomplish
tomorrow we must give up all idea of take ani we were inde
exactli at the 20th of march tomorrow the 21st would be the
equinox the sun would disappear behind the horizon for six month and
with it disappear the long polar night would begin sinc the
septemb equinox it had emerg from the northern horizon rise by
lengthen spiral up to the 21st of decemb at thi period the
summer solstic of the northern region it had begun to descend and
tomorrow wa to shed it last rai upon them i commun my fear
and observ to captain nemo
you ar right m aronnax said he if tomorrow i cannot take the
altitud of the sun i shall not be abl to do it for six month but
precis becaus chanc ha led me into these sea on the 21st of
march my bear will be easi to take if at twelv we can see the
sun
why captain
becaus then the orb of dai describ such lengthen curv that it
is difficult to measur exactli it height abov the horizon and grave
error mai be made with instrument
what will you do then
i shall onli us my chronomet repli captain nemo if tomorrow
the 21st of march the disc of the sun allow for refract is
exactli cut by the northern horizon it will show that i am at the
south pole
just so said i but thi statement is not mathemat correct
becaus the equinox doe not necessarili begin at noon
veri like sir but the error will not be a hundr yard and we do
not want more till tomorrow then
captain nemo return on board conseil and i remain to survei the
shore observ and studi until five oclock then i went to bed
not howev without invok like the indian the favour of the
radiant orb the next dai the 21st of march at five in the morn i
mount the platform i found captain nemo there
the weather is lighten a littl said he i have some hope after
breakfast we will go on shore and choos a post for observ
that point settl i sought ned land i want to take him with me
but the obstin canadian refus and i saw that hi taciturn and
hi bad humour grew dai by dai after all i wa not sorri for hi
obstinaci under the circumst inde there were too mani seal on
shore and we ought not to lai such temptat in thi unreflect
fisherman wai breakfast over we went on shore the nautilu had
gone some mile further up in the night it wa a whole leagu from the
coast abov which rear a sharp peak about five hundr yard high
the boat took with me captain nemo two men of the crew and the
instrument which consist of a chronomet a telescop and a
baromet while cross i saw numer whale belong to the three
kind peculiar to the southern sea the whale or the english right
whale which ha no dorsal fin the humpback with reev chest and
larg whitish fin which in spite of it name do not form wing
and the finback of a yellowish brown the liveliest of all the
cetacea thi power creatur is heard a long wai off when he throw
to a great height column of air and vapour which look like whirlwind
of smoke these differ mammal were disport themselv in troop
in the quiet water and i could see that thi basin of the antarct
pole serv as a place of refug to the cetacea too close track by
the hunter i also notic larg medu float between the reed
at nine we land the sky wa brighten the cloud were fly to
the south and the fog seem to be leav the cold surfac of the
water captain nemo went toward the peak which he doubtless meant to
be hi observatori it wa a pain ascent over the sharp lava and the
pumiceston in an atmospher often impregn with a sulphur
smell from the smoke crack for a man unaccustom to walk on land
the captain climb the steep slope with an agil i never saw
equal and which a hunter would have envi we were two hour
get to the summit of thi peak which wa half porphyri and half
basalt from thenc we look upon a vast sea which toward the north
distinctli trace it boundari line upon the sky at our feet lai
field of dazzl white over our head a pale azur free from
fog to the north the disc of the sun seem like a ball of fire
alreadi horn by the cut of the horizon from the bosom of the
water rose sheav of liquid jet by hundr in the distanc lai the
nautilu like a cetacean asleep on the water behind us to the south
and east an immens countri and a chaotic heap of rock and ic the
limit of which were not visibl on arriv at the summit captain
nemo carefulli took the mean height of the baromet for he would have
to consid that in take hi observ at a quarter to twelv the
sun then seen onli by refract look like a golden disc shed
it last rai upon thi desert contin and sea which never man had
yet plough captain nemo furnish with a lenticular glass which by
mean of a mirror correct the refract watch the orb sink
below the horizon by degre follow a lengthen diagon i held
the chronomet my heart beat fast if the disappear of the
halfdisc of the sun coincid with twelv oclock on the chronomet
we were at the pole itself
twelv i exclaim
the south pole repli captain nemo in a grave voic hand me
the glass which show the orb cut in exactli equal part by the
horizon
i look at the last rai crown the peak and the shadow mount
by degre up it slope at that moment captain nemo rest with hi
hand on my shoulder said
i captain nemo on thi 21st dai of march 1868 have reach the
south pole on the ninetieth degre and i take possess of thi part
of the globe equal to onesixth of the known contin
in whose name captain
in my own sir
sai which captain nemo unfurl a black banner bear an n in
gold quarter on it bunt then turn toward the orb of dai
whose last rai lap the horizon of the sea he exclaim
adieu sun disappear thou radiant orb rest beneath thi open sea
and let a night of six month spread it shadow over my new domain
chapter xv
accid or incid
the next dai the 22nd of march at six in the morn prepar
for departur were begun the last gleam of twilight were melt into
night the cold wa great the constel shone with wonder
intens in the zenith glitter that wondrou southern crossth
polar bear of antarct region the thermomet show 120 below zero
and when the wind freshen it wa most bite flake of ic increas
on the open water the sea seem everywher alik numer blackish
patch spread on the surfac show the format of fresh ic
evid the southern basin frozen dure the six winter month wa
absolut inaccess what becam of the whale in that time
doubtless thei went beneath the iceberg seek more practic
sea as to the seal and mors accustom to live in a hard climat
thei remain on these ici shore these creatur have the instinct to
break hole in the icefield and to keep them open to these hole thei
come for breath when the bird driven awai by the cold have
emigr to the north these sea mammal remain sole master of the
polar contin but the reservoir were fill with water and the
nautilu wa slowli descend at 1000 feet deep it stop it
screw beat the wave and it advanc straight toward the north at a
speed of fifteen mile an hour toward night it wa alreadi float
under the immens bodi of the iceberg at three in the morn i wa
awaken by a violent shock i sat up in my bed and listen in the
dark when i wa thrown into the middl of the room the
nautilu after have struck had rebound violent i grope
along the partit and by the staircas to the saloon which wa lit
by the lumin ceil the furnitur wa upset fortun the
window were firmli set and had held fast the pictur on the
starboard side from be no longer vertic were cling to the
paper whilst those of the port side were hang at least a foot from
the wall the nautilu wa ly on it starboard side perfectli
motionless i heard footstep and a confus of voic but captain
nemo did not appear as i wa leav the saloon ned land and conseil
enter
what is the matter said i at onc
i came to ask you sir repli conseil
confound it exclaim the canadian i know well enough the
nautilu ha struck and judg by the wai she li i do not think
she will right herself as she did the first time in torr strait
but i ask ha she at least come to the surfac of the sea
we do not know said conseil
it is easi to decid i answer i consult the manomet to my
great surpris it show a depth of more than 180 fathom what doe
that mean i exclaim
we must ask captain nemo said conseil
but where shall we find him said ned land
follow me said i to my companion
we left the saloon there wa no on in the librari at the centr
staircas by the berth of the ship crew there wa no on i
thought that captain nemo must be in the pilot cage it wa best to
wait we all return to the saloon for twenti minut we remain
thu try to hear the slightest nois which might be made on board
the nautilu when captain nemo enter he seem not to see us hi
face gener so impass show sign of uneasi he watch
the compass silent then the manomet and go to the
planispher place hi finger on a spot repres the southern
sea i would not interrupt him but some minut later when he
turn toward me i said us on of hi own express in the
torr strait
an incid captain
no sir an accid thi time
seriou
perhap
is the danger immedi
no
the nautilu ha strand
ye
and thi ha happenedhow
from a capric of natur not from the ignor of man not a mistak
ha been made in the work but we cannot prevent equilibrium from
produc it effect we mai brave human law but we cannot resist
natur on
captain nemo had chosen a strang moment for utter thi
philosoph reflect on the whole hi answer help me littl
mai i ask sir the caus of thi accid
an enorm block of ic a whole mountain ha turn over he
repli when iceberg ar undermin at their base by warmer water or
reiter shock their centr of graviti rise and the whole thing
turn over thi is what ha happen on of these block as it fell
struck the nautilu then glide under it hull rais it with
irresist forc bring it into bed which ar not so thick where
it is ly on it side
but can we not get the nautilu off by empti it reservoir that
it might regain it equilibrium
that sir is be done at thi moment you can hear the pump
work look at the needl of the manomet it show that the
nautilu is rise but the block of ic is float with it and
until some obstacl stop it ascend motion our posit cannot be
alter
inde the nautilu still held the same posit to starboard
doubtless it would right itself when the block stop but at thi
moment who know if we mai not be frightfulli crush between the two
glassi surfac i reflect on all the consequ of our posit
captain nemo never took hi ey off the manomet sinc the fall of
the iceberg the nautilu had risen about a hundr and fifti feet
but it still made the same angl with the perpendicular suddenli a
slight movement wa felt in the hold evid it wa right a
littl thing hang in the saloon were sensibl return to their
normal posit the partit were near the upright no on spoke
with beat heart we watch and felt the straighten the board
becam horizont under our feet ten minut pass
at last we have right i exclaim
ye said captain nemo go to the door of the saloon
but ar we float i ask
certainli he repli sinc the reservoir ar not empti and when
empti the nautilu must rise to the surfac of the sea
we were in open sea but at a distanc of about ten yard on either
side of the nautilu rose a dazzl wall of ic abov and beneath
the same wall abov becaus the lower surfac of the iceberg
stretch over us like an immens ceil beneath becaus the
overturn block have slid by degre had found a restingplac on
the later wall which kept it in that posit the nautilu wa
realli imprison in a perfect tunnel of ic more than twenti yard in
breadth fill with quiet water it wa easi to get out of it by go
either forward or backward and then make a free passag under the
iceberg some hundr of yard deeper the lumin ceil had been
extinguish but the saloon wa still resplend with intens light
it wa the power reflect from the glass partit sent violent
back to the sheet of the lantern i cannot describ the effect of the
voltaic rai upon the great block so caprici cut upon everi
angl everi ridg everi facet wa thrown a differ light accord
to the natur of the vein run through the ic a dazzl mine of
gem particularli of sapphir their blue rai cross with the
green of the emerald here and there were opal shade of wonder
soft run through bright spot like diamond of fire the
brillianc of which the ey could not bear the power of the lantern
seem increas a hundredfold like a lamp through the lenticular
plate of a firstclass lighthous
how beauti how beauti cri conseil
ye i said it is a wonder sight is it not ned
ye confound it ye answer ned land it is superb i am mad at
be oblig to admit it no on ha ever seen anyth like it but
the sight mai cost us dear and if i must sai all i think we ar
see here thing which god never intend man to see
ned wa right it wa too beauti suddenli a cry from conseil made
me turn
what is it i ask
shut your ey sir do not look sir sai which conseil clap
hi hand over hi ey
but what is the matter my boi
i am dazzl blind
my ey turn involuntarili toward the glass but i could not stand
the fire which seem to devour them i understood what had happen
the nautilu had put on full speed all the quiet lustr of the
icewal wa at onc chang into flash of lightn the fire from
these myriad of diamond wa blind it requir some time to calm
our troubl look at last the hand were taken down
faith i should never have believ it said conseil
it wa then five in the morn and at that moment a shock wa felt at
the bow of the nautilu i knew that it spur had struck a block of
ic it must have been a fals manuvr for thi submarin tunnel
obstruct by block wa not veri easi navig i thought that
captain nemo by chang hi cours would either turn these obstacl
or els follow the wind of the tunnel in ani case the road befor
us could not be entir block but contrari to my expect the
nautilu took a decid retrograd motion
we ar go backward said conseil
ye i repli thi end of the tunnel can have no egress
and then
then said i the work is easi we must go back again and go out
at the southern open that is all
in speak thu i wish to appear more confid than i realli wa
but the retrograd motion of the nautilu wa increas and
revers the screw it carri us at great speed
it will be a hindranc said ned
what doe it matter some hour more or less provid we get out at
last
ye repeat ned land provid we do get out at last
for a short time i walk from the saloon to the librari my companion
were silent i soon threw myself on an ottoman and took a book which
my ey overran mechan a quarter of an hour after conseil
approach me said is what you ar read veri interest sir
veri interest i repli
i should think so sir it is your own book you ar read
my book
and inde i wa hold in my hand the work on the great submarin
depth i did not even dream of it i close the book and return to
my walk ned and conseil rose to go
stai here my friend said i detain them let us remain
togeth until we ar out of thi block
as you pleas sir conseil repli
some hour pass i often look at the instrument hang from the
partit the manomet show that the nautilu kept at a constant
depth of more than three hundr yard the compass still point to
south the log indic a speed of twenti mile an hour which in
such a cramp space wa veri great but captain nemo knew that he
could not hasten too much and that minut were worth ag to us at
twentyf minut past eight a second shock took place thi time
from behind i turn pale my companion were close by my side i
seiz conseil hand our look express our feel better than
word at thi moment the captain enter the saloon i went up to him
our cours is bar southward i ask
ye sir the iceberg ha shift and close everi outlet
we ar block up then

want of air
thu around the nautilu abov and below wa an impenetr wall
of ic we were prison to the iceberg i watch the captain hi
counten had resum it habitu imperturb
gentlemen he said calmli there ar two wai of dy in the
circumst in which we ar place thi puzzl person had the
air of a mathemat professor lectur to hi pupil the first is
to be crush the second is to die of suffoc i do not speak of
the possibl of dy of hunger for the suppli of provis in the
nautilu will certainli last longer than we shall let us then
calcul our chanc
as to suffoc captain i repli that is not to be fear
becaus our reservoir ar full
just so but thei will onli yield two dai suppli of air now for
thirtysix hour we have been hidden under the water and alreadi the
heavi atmospher of the nautilu requir renew in fortyeight
hour our reserv will be exhaust
well captain can we be deliv befor fortyeight hour
we will attempt it at least by pierc the wall that surround us
on which side
sound will tell us i am go to run the nautilu aground on the
lower bank and my men will attack the iceberg on the side that is
least thick
captain nemo went out soon i discov by a hiss nois that the
water wa enter the reservoir the nautilu sank slowli and
rest on the ic at a depth of 350 yard the depth at which the lower
bank wa immers
my friend i said our situat is seriou but i reli on your
courag and energi
sir repli the canadian i am readi to do anyth for the gener
safeti
good ned and i held out my hand to the canadian
i will add he continu that be as handi with the pickax as
with the harpoon if i can be us to the captain he can command my
servic
he will not refus your help come ned
i led him to the room where the crew of the nautilu were put on
their corkjacket i told the captain of ned propos which he
accept the canadian put on hi seacostum and wa readi as soon as
hi companion when ned wa dress i reenter the drawingroom
where the pane of glass were open and post near conseil i
examin the ambient bed that support the nautilu some instant
after we saw a dozen of the crew set foot on the bank of ic and
among them ned land easili known by hi statur captain nemo wa with
them befor proceed to dig the wall he took the sound to be
sure of work in the right direct long sound line were sunk
in the side wall but after fifteen yard thei were again stop by
the thick wall it wa useless to attack it on the ceilinglik
surfac sinc the iceberg itself measur more than 400 yard in
height captain nemo then sound the lower surfac there ten yard of
wall separ us from the water so great wa the thick of the
icefield it wa necessari therefor to cut from it a piec equal in
extent to the waterlin of the nautilu there were about 6000 cubic
yard to detach so as to dig a hole by which we could descend to the
icefield the work had begun immedi and carri on with
indefatig energi instead of dig round the nautilu which
would have involv greater difficulti captain nemo had an immens
trench made at eight yard from the portquart then the men set to
work simultan with their screw on sever point of it
circumfer present the pickax attack thi compact matter
vigor and larg block were detach from the mass by a curiou
effect of specif graviti these block lighter than water fled so
to speak to the vault of the tunnel that increas in thick at
the top in proport as it diminish at the base but that matter
littl so long as the lower part grew thinner after two hour hard
work ned land came in exhaust he and hi comrad were replac by
new worker whom conseil and i join the second lieuten of the
nautilu superintend us the water seem singularli cold but i
soon got warm handl the pickax my movement were free enough
although thei were made under a pressur of thirti atmospher when i
reenter after work two hour to take some food and rest i
found a percept differ between the pure fluid with which the
rouquayrol engin suppli me and the atmospher of the nautilu
alreadi charg with carbon acid the air had not been renew for
fortyeight hour and it vivifi qualiti were consider
enfeebl howev after a laps of twelv hour we had onli rais a
block of ic on yard thick on the mark surfac which wa about 600
cubic yard reckon that it took twelv hour to accomplish thi
much it would take five night and four dai to bring thi enterpris
to a satisfactori conclus five night and four dai and we have
onli air enough for two dai in the reservoir without take into
account said ned that even if we get out of thi infern prison
we shall also be imprison under the iceberg shut out from all
possibl commun with the atmospher true enough who could
then forese the minimum of time necessari for our deliver we
might be suffoc befor the nautilu could regain the surfac of
the wave wa it destin to perish in thi icetomb with all those
it enclos the situat wa terribl but everyon had look the
danger in the face and each wa determin to do hi duti to the last
as i expect dure the night a new block a yard squar wa carri
awai and still further sank the immens hollow but in the morn
when dress in my corkjacket i travers the slushi mass at a
temperatur of six or seven degre below zero i remark that the
side wall were gradual close in the bed of water farthest from
the trench that were not warm by the men work show a tendenc
to solidif in presenc of thi new and immin danger what
would becom of our chanc of safeti and how hinder the
solidif of thi liquid medium that would burst the partit
of the nautilu like glass
i did not tell my companion of thi new danger what wa the good of
damp the energi thei displai in the pain work of escap but
when i went on board again i told captain nemo of thi grave
complic
i know it he said in that calm tone which could counteract the most
terribl apprehens it is on danger more but i see no wai of
escap it the onli chanc of safeti is to go quicker than
solidif we must be beforehand with it that is all
on thi dai for sever hour i us my pickax vigor the work
kept me up besid to work wa to quit the nautilu and breath
directli the pure air drawn from the reservoir and suppli by our
apparatu and to quit the impoverish and vitiat atmospher
toward even the trench wa dug on yard deeper when i return on
board i wa nearli suffoc by the carbon acid with which the air
wa filledah if we had onli the chemic mean to drive awai thi
deleteri ga we had plenti of oxygen all thi water contain a
consider quantiti and by dissolv it with our power pile it
would restor the vivifi fluid i had thought well over it but of
what good wa that sinc the carbon acid produc by our respir
had invad everi part of the vessel to absorb it it wa necessari to
fill some jar with caustic potash and to shake them incessantli now
thi substanc wa want on board and noth could replac it on
that even captain nemo ought to open the tap of hi reservoir
and let some pure air into the interior of the nautilu without thi
precaut we could not get rid of the sens of suffoc the next
dai march 26th i resum my miner work in begin the fifth yard
the side wall and the lower surfac of the iceberg thicken visibl
it wa evid that thei would meet befor the nautilu wa abl to
disengag itself despair seiz me for an instant my pickax nearli
fell from my hand what wa the good of dig if i must be
suffoc crush by the water that wa turn into stonea
punish that the feroc of the savag even would not have
invent just then captain nemo pass near me i touch hi hand and
show him the wall of our prison the wall to port had advanc to at
least four yard from the hull of the nautilu the captain
understood me and sign me to follow him we went on board i took
off my corkjacket and accompani him into the drawingroom
m aronnax we must attempt some desper mean or we shall be
seal up in thi solidifi water as in cement
ye but what is to be done
ah if my nautilu were strong enough to bear thi pressur without
be crush
well i ask not catch the captain idea
do you not understand he repli that thi congel of water
will help us do you not see that by it solidif it would burst
through thi field of ic that imprison us as when it freez it
burst the hardest stone do you not perceiv that it would be an
agent of safeti instead of destruct
ye captain perhap but whatev resist to crush the
nautilu possess it could not support thi terribl pressur and
would be flatten like an iron plate
i know it sir therefor we must not reckon on the aid of natur but
on our own exert we must stop thi solidif not onli will
the side wall be press togeth but there is not ten feet of water
befor or behind the nautilu the congel gain on us on all
side
how long will the air in the reservoir last for us to breath on
board
the captain look in my face after tomorrow thei will be empti
a cold sweat came over me howev ought i to have been astonish at
the answer on march 22 the nautilu wa in the open polar sea we
were at 26 for five dai we had live on the reserv on board and
what wa left of the respir air must be kept for the worker even
now as i write my recollect is still so vivid that an involuntari
terror seiz me and my lung seem to be without air meanwhil
captain nemo reflect silent and evid an idea had struck him
but he seem to reject it at last these word escap hi lip
boil water he mutter
boil water i cri
ye sir we ar enclos in a space that is rel confin
would not jet of boil water constantli inject by the pump
rais the temperatur in thi part and stai the congel
let us try it i said resolut
let us try it professor
the thermomet then stood at 7 outsid captain nemo took me to the
gallei where the vast distillatori machin stood that furnish the
drinkabl water by evapor thei fill these with water and all
the electr heat from the pile wa thrown through the worm bath in
the liquid in a few minut thi water reach 100 it wa direct
toward the pump while fresh water replac it in proport the
heat develop by the trough wa such that cold water drawn up from
the sea after onli have gone through the machin came boil into
the bodi of the pump the inject wa begun and three hour after
the thermomet mark 6 below zero outsid on degre wa gain
two hour later the thermomet onli mark 4
we shall succe i said to the captain after have anxious
watch the result of the oper
i think he answer that we shall not be crush we have no more
suffoc to fear
dure the night the temperatur of the water rose to 1 below zero
the inject could not carri it to a higher point but as the
congel of the seawat produc at least 2 i wa at least
reassur against the danger of solidif
the next dai march 27th six yard of ic had been clear twelv
feet onli remain to be clear awai there wa yet fortyeight
hour work the air could not be renew in the interior of the
nautilu and thi dai would make it wors an intoler weight
oppress me toward three oclock in the even thi feel rose to
a violent degre yawn disloc my jaw my lung pant as thei
inhal thi burn fluid which becam rarefi more and more a
moral torpor took hold of me i wa powerless almost unconsci my
brave conseil though exhibit the same symptom and suffer in the
same manner never left me he took my hand and encourag me and i
heard him murmur oh if i could onli not breath so as to leav more
air for my master
tear came into my ey on hear him speak thu if our situat to
all wa intoler in the interior with what hast and glad would
we put on our corkjacket to work in our turn pickax sound on the
frozen iceb our arm ach the skin wa torn off our hand but
what were these fatigu what did the wound matter vital air came to
the lung we breath we breath
all thi time no on prolong hi voluntari task beyond the prescrib
time hi task accomplish each on hand in turn to hi pant
companion the apparatu that suppli him with life captain nemo set
the exampl and submit first to thi sever disciplin when the
time came he gave up hi apparatu to anoth and return to the
vitiat air on board calm unflinch unmurmur
on that dai the ordinari work wa accomplish with unusu vigour
onli two yard remain to be rais from the surfac two yard onli
separ us from the open sea but the reservoir were nearli empti
of air the littl that remain ought to be kept for the worker not
a particl for the nautilu when i went back on board i wa half
suffoc what a night i know not how to describ it the next dai
my breath wa oppress dizzi accompani the pain in my head
and made me like a drunken man my companion show the same symptom
some of the crew had rattl in the throat
on that dai the sixth of our imprison captain nemo find the
pickax work too slowli resolv to crush the iceb that still
separ us from the liquid sheet thi man cool and energi
never forsook him he subdu hi physic pain by moral forc
by hi order the vessel wa lighten that is to sai rais from the
iceb by a chang of specif graviti when it float thei tow it
so as to bring it abov the immens trench made on the level of the
waterlin then fill hi reservoir of water he descend and
shut himself up in the hole
just then all the crew came on board and the doubl door of
commun wa shut the nautilu then rest on the bed of ic
which wa not on yard thick and which the sound lead had
perfor in a thousand place the tap of the reservoir were then
open and a hundr cubic yard of water wa let in increas the
weight of the nautilu to 1800 ton we wait we listen
forget our suffer in hope our safeti depend on thi last
chanc notwithstand the buzz in my head i soon heard the
hum sound under the hull of the nautilu the ic crack with a
singular nois like tear paper and the nautilu sank
we ar off murmur conseil in my ear
i could not answer him i seiz hi hand and press it convuls
all at onc carri awai by it fright overcharg the nautilu
sank like a bullet under the water that is to sai it fell as if it
wa in a vacuum then all the electr forc wa put on the pump that
soon began to let the water out of the reservoir after some minut
our fall wa stop soon too the manomet indic an ascend
movement the screw go at full speed made the iron hull trembl to
it veri bolt and drew us toward the north but if thi float
under the iceberg is to last anoth dai befor we reach the open sea
i shall be dead first
half stretch upon a divan in the librari i wa suffoc my face
wa purpl my lip blue my faculti suspend i neither saw nor
heard all notion of time had gone from my mind my muscl could not
contract i do not know how mani hour pass thu but i wa consciou
of the agoni that wa come over me i felt as if i wa go to die
suddenli i came to some breath of air penetr my lung had we
risen to the surfac of the wave were we free of the iceberg no ned
and conseil my two brave friend were sacrif themselv to save
me some particl of air still remain at the bottom of on
apparatu instead of us it thei had kept it for me and while
thei were be suffoc thei gave me life drop by drop i want
to push back the thing thei held my hand and for some moment i
breath freeli i look at the clock it wa eleven in the morn
it ought to be the 28th of march the nautilu went at a fright
pace forti mile an hour it liter tore through the water where
wa captain nemo had he succumb were hi companion dead with him
at the moment the manomet indic that we were not more than twenti
feet from the surfac a mere plate of ic separ us from the
atmospher could we not break it perhap in ani case the nautilu
wa go to attempt it i felt that it wa in an obliqu posit
lower the stern and rais the bow the introduct of water had
been the mean of disturb it equilibrium then impel by it
power screw it attack the icefield from beneath like a
formid batteringram it broke it by back and then rush
forward against the field which gradual gave wai and at last
dash suddenli against it shot forward on the icefield that
crush beneath it weight the panel wa openedon might sai torn
offand the pure air came in in abund to all part of the
nautilu
chapter xvii
from cape horn to the amazon
how i got on to the platform i have no idea perhap the canadian had
carri me there but i breath i inhal the vivifi seaair my
two companion were get drunk with the fresh particl the other
unhappi men had been so long without food that thei could not with
impun indulg in the simplest aliment that were given them we on
the contrari had no end to restrain ourselv we could draw thi air
freeli into our lung and it wa the breez the breez alon that
fill us with thi keen enjoy
ah said conseil how delight thi oxygen is master need not
fear to breath it there is enough for everybodi
ned land did not speak but he open hi jaw wide enough to frighten
a shark our strength soon return and when i look round me i saw
we were alon on the platform the foreign seamen in the nautilu
were content with the air that circul in the interior none of
them had come to drink in the open air
the first word i spoke were word of gratitud and thank to my
two companion ned and conseil had prolong my life dure the last
hour of thi long agoni all my gratitud could not repai such
devot
my friend said i we ar bound on to the other for ever and i am
under infinit oblig to you
which i shall take advantag of exclaim the canadian
what do you mean said conseil
i mean that i shall take you with me when i leav thi infern
nautilu
well said conseil after all thi ar we go right
ye i repli for we ar go the wai of the sun and here the
sun is in the north
no doubt said ned land but it remain to be seen whether he will
bring the ship into the pacif or the atlant ocean that is into
frequent or desert sea
i could not answer that question and i fear that captain nemo would
rather take us to the vast ocean that touch the coast of asia and
america at the same time he would thu complet the tour round the
submarin world and return to those water in which the nautilu
could sail freeli we ought befor long to settl thi import
point the nautilu went at a rapid pace the polar circl wa soon
pass and the cours shape for cape horn we were off the american
point march 31st at seven oclock in the even then all our past
suffer were forgotten the remembr of that imprison in the
ic wa effac from our mind we onli thought of the futur captain
nemo did not appear again either in the drawingroom or on the
platform the point shown each dai on the planispher and mark by
the lieuten show me the exact direct of the nautilu now
on that even it wa evid to my great satisfact that we
were go back to the north by the atlant the next dai april 1st
when the nautilu ascend to the surfac some minut befor noon
we sight land to the west it wa terra del fuego which the first
navig name thu from see the quantiti of smoke that rose from
the nativ hut the coast seem low to me but in the distanc rose
high mountain i even thought i had a glimps of mount sarmiento that
rise 2070 yard abov the level of the sea with a veri point
summit which accord as it is misti or clear is a sign of fine or
of wet weather at thi moment the peak wa clearli defin against the
sky the nautilu dive again under the water approach the
coast which wa onli some few mile off from the glass window in the
drawingroom i saw long seawe and gigant fuci and varech of
which the open polar sea contain so mani specimen with their sharp
polish filament thei measur about 300 yard in lengthreal
cabl thicker than on thumb and have great tenac thei ar
often us as rope for vessel anoth weed known as velp with
leav four feet long buri in the coral concret hung at the
bottom it serv as nest and food for myriad of crustacea and
mollusc crab and cuttlefish there seal and otter had splendid
repast eat the flesh of fish with seaveget accord to the
english fashion over thi fertil and luxuri ground the nautilu
pass with great rapid toward even it approach the falkland
group the rough summit of which i recognis the follow dai the
depth of the sea wa moder on the shore our net brought in
beauti specimen of sea weed and particularli a certain fucu the
root of which were fill with the best mussel in the world gees
and duck fell by dozen on the platform and soon took their place in
the pantri on board
when the last height of the falkland had disappear from the
horizon the nautilu sank to between twenti and twentyf yard
and follow the american coast captain nemo did not show himself
until the 3rd of april we did not quit the shore of patagonia
sometim under the ocean sometim at the surfac the nautilu
pass beyond the larg estuari form by the uraguai it direct
wa northward and follow the long wind of the coast of south
america we had then made 1600 mile sinc our embark in the sea
of japan about eleven oclock in the morn the tropic of capricorn
wa cross on the thirtyseventh meridian and we pass cape frio
stand out to sea captain nemo to ned land great displeasur did
not like the neighbourhood of the inhabit coast of brazil for we
went at a giddi speed not a fish not a bird of the swiftest kind
could follow us and the natur curios of these sea escap all
observ
thi speed wa kept up for sever dai and in the even of the 9th
of april we sight the most westerli point of south america that form
cape san roqu but then the nautilu swerv again and sought the
lowest depth of a submarin vallei which is between thi cape and
sierra leon on the african coast thi vallei bifurc to the
parallel of the antil and termin at the mouth by the enorm
depress of 9000 yard in thi place the geolog basin of the
ocean form as far as the lesser antil a cliff to three and a half
mile perpendicular in height and at the parallel of the cape verd
island an other wall not less consider that enclos thu all
the sunk contin of the atlant the bottom of thi immens vallei
is dot with some mountain that give to these submarin place a
picturesqu aspect i speak moreov from the manuscript chart that
were in the librari of the nautiluschart evid due to captain
nemo hand and made after hi person observ for two dai the
desert and deep water were visit by mean of the inclin plane
the nautilu wa furnish with long diagon broadsid which
carri it to all elev but on the 11th of april it rose
suddenli and land appear at the mouth of the amazon river a vast
estuari the embouchur of which is so consider that it freshen
the seawat for the distanc of sever leagu
the equat wa cross twenti mile to the west were the guiana a
french territori on which we could have found an easi refug but a
stiff breez wa blow and the furiou wave would not have allow
a singl boat to face them ned land understood that no doubt for he
spoke not a word about it for my part i made no allus to hi
scheme of flight for i would not urg him to make an attempt that
must inevit fail i made the time pass pleasantli by interest
studi dure the dai of april 11th and 12th the nautilu did not
leav the surfac of the sea and the net brought in a marvel haul

that god had charg to infest the surfac of the sea
chapter xviii
the poulp
for sever dai the nautilu kept off from the american coast
evid it did not wish to risk the tide of the gulf of mexico or of
the sea of the antil april 16th we sight martiniqu and
guadaloup from a distanc of about thirti mile i saw their tall
peak for an instant the canadian who count on carri out hi
project in the gulf by either land or hail on of the numer
boat that coast from on island to anoth wa quit dishearten
flight would have been quit practic if ned land had been abl to
take possess of the boat without the captain knowledg but in the
open sea it could not be thought of the canadian conseil and i had a
long convers on thi subject for six month we had been prison
on board the nautilu we had travel 17000 leagu and as ned
land said there wa no reason why it should come to an end we could
hope noth from the captain of the nautilu but onli from
ourselv besid for some time past he had becom graver more
retir less sociabl he seem to shun me i met him rare
formerli he wa pleas to explain the submarin marvel to me now he
left me to my studi and came no more to the saloon what chang had
come over him for what caus for my part i did not wish to buri with
me my curiou and novel studi i had now the power to write the true
book of the sea and thi book sooner or later i wish to see
daylight the land nearest us wa the archipelago of the bahama there
rose high submarin cliff cover with larg weed it wa about
eleven oclock when ned land drew my attent to a formid
prick like the sting of an ant which wa produc by mean of
larg seawe
well i said these ar proper cavern for poulp and i should not
be astonish to see some of these monster
what said conseil cuttlefish real cuttlefish of the cephalopod
class
no i said poulp of huge dimens
i will never believ that such anim exist said ned
well said conseil with the most seriou air in the world i
rememb perfectli to have seen a larg vessel drawn under the wave by
an octopuss arm
you saw that said the canadian
ye ned
with your own ey
with my own ey
where prai might that be
at st malo answer conseil
in the port said ned iron
no in a church repli conseil
in a church cri the canadian
ye friend ned in a pictur repres the poulp in question
good said ned land burst out laugh
he is quit right i said i have heard of thi pictur but the
subject repres is taken from a legend and you know what to think
of legend in the matter of natur histori besid when it is a
question of monster the imagin is apt to run wild not onli is
it suppos that these poulp can draw down vessel but a certain
olau magnu speak of an octopu a mile long that is more like an
island than an anim it is also said that the bishop of nidro wa
build an altar on an immens rock mass finish the rock began to
walk and return to the sea the rock wa a poulp anoth bishop
pontoppidan speak also of a poulp on which a regiment of cavalri
could manuvr lastli the ancient naturalist speak of monster whose
mouth were like gulf and which were too larg to pass through the
strait of gibraltar
but how much is true of these stori ask conseil
noth my friend at least of that which pass the limit of truth
to get to fabl or legend nevertheless there must be some ground for
the imagin of the storytel on cannot deni that poulp and
cuttlefish exist of a larg speci inferior howev to the
cetacean aristotl ha state the dimens of a cuttlefish as five
cubit or nine feet two inch our fishermen frequent see some that
ar more than four feet long some skeleton of poulp ar preserv in
the museum of triest and montpeli that measur two yard in
length besid accord to the calcul of some naturalist on
of these anim onli six feet long would have tentacl twentyseven
feet long that would suffic to make a formid monster
do thei fish for them in these dai ask ned
if thei do not fish for them sailor see them at least on of my
friend captain paul bo of havr ha often affirm that he met on
of these monster of coloss dimens in the indian sea but the
most astonish fact and which doe not permit of the denial of the
exist of these gigant anim happen some year ago in 1861
what is the fact ask ned land
thi is it in 1861 to the northeast of teneriff veri nearli in
the same latitud we ar in now the crew of the despatchboat alector
perceiv a monstrou cuttlefish swim in the water captain
bouguer went near to the anim and attack it with harpoon and gun
without much success for ball and harpoon glide over the soft
flesh after sever fruitless attempt the crew tri to pass a
slipknot round the bodi of the mollusc the noos slip as far as
the tail fin and there stop thei tri then to haul it on board
but it weight wa so consider that the tight of the cord
separ the tail from the bodi and depriv of thi ornament he
disappear under the water
inde is that a fact
an indisput fact my good ned thei propos to name thi poulp
bouguer cuttlefish
what length wa it ask the canadian
did it not measur about six yard said conseil who post at the
window wa examin again the irregular wind of the cliff
precis i repli
it head rejoin conseil wa it not crown with eight tentacl
that beat the water like a nest of serpent
precis
had not it ey place at the back of it head consider
develop
ye conseil
and wa not it mouth like a parrot beak
exactli conseil
veri well no offenc to master he repli quietli if thi is not
bouguer cuttlefish it is at least on of it brother
i look at conseil ned land hurri to the window
what a horribl beast he cri
i look in my turn and could not repress a gestur of disgust befor
my ey wa a horribl monster worthi to figur in the legend of the
marvel it wa an immens cuttlefish be eight yard long it
swam crosswai in the direct of the nautilu with great speed
watch us with it enorm stare green ey it eight arm or
rather feet fix to it head that have given the name of cephalopod
to these anim were twice as long as it bodi and were twist like
the furi hair on could see the 250 air hole on the inner side of
the tentacl the monster mouth a horn beak like a parrot
open and shut vertic it tongu a horn substanc furnish
with sever row of point teeth came out quiver from thi
verit pair of shear what a freak of natur a bird beak on a
mollusc it spindlelik bodi form a fleshi mass that might weigh
4000 to 5000 lb the vari colour chang with great rapid
accord to the irrit of the anim pass success from
livid grei to reddish brown what irrit thi mollusc no doubt the
presenc of the nautilu more formid than itself and on which
it sucker or it jaw had no hold yet what monster these poulp
ar what vital the creator ha given them what vigour in their
movement and thei possess three heart chanc had brought us in
presenc of thi cuttlefish and i did not wish to lose the opportun
of carefulli studi thi specimen of cephalopod i overcam the
horror that inspir me and take a pencil began to draw it
perhap thi is the same which the alector saw said conseil
no repli the canadian for thi is whole and the other had lost
it tail
that is no reason i repli the arm and tail of these anim
ar reform by renew and in seven year the tail of bouguer
cuttlefish ha no doubt had time to grow
by thi time other poulp appear at the port light i count seven
thei form a process after the nautilu and i heard their beak
gnash against the iron hull i continu my work these monster
kept in the water with such precis that thei seem immov
suddenli the nautilu stop a shock made it trembl in everi
plate
have we struck anyth i ask
in ani case repli the canadian we shall be free for we ar
float
the nautilu wa float no doubt but it did not move a minut
pass captain nemo follow by hi lieuten enter the
drawingroom i had not seen him for some time he seem dull without
notic or speak to us he went to the panel look at the poulp
and said someth to hi lieuten the latter went out soon the
panel were shut the ceil wa light i went toward the captain
a curiou collect of poulp i said
ye inde mr naturalist he repli and we ar go to fight
them man to beast
i look at him i thought i had not heard aright
man to beast i repeat
ye sir the screw is stop i think that the horni jaw of on of
the cuttlefish is entangl in the blade that is what prevent our
move
what ar you go to do
rise to the surfac and slaughter thi vermin
a difficult enterpris
ye inde the electr bullet ar powerless against the soft
flesh where thei do not find resist enough to go off but we shall
attack them with the hatchet
and the harpoon sir said the canadian if you do not refus my
help
i will accept it master land
we will follow you i said and follow captain nemo we went
toward the central staircas
there about ten men with boardinghatchet were readi for the attack
conseil and i took two hatchet ned land seiz a harpoon the
nautilu had then risen to the surfac on of the sailor post on
the top ladderstep unscrew the bolt of the panel but hardli were
the screw loos when the panel rose with great violenc evid
drawn by the sucker of a poulp arm immedi on of these arm
slid like a serpent down the open and twenti other were abov with
on blow of the ax captain nemo cut thi formid tentacl that
slid wriggl down the ladder just as we were press on on the
other to reach the platform two other arm lash the air came down
on the seaman place befor captain nemo and lift him up with
irresist power captain nemo utter a cry and rush out we
hurri after him
illustr on of these long arm glide through the open
what a scene the unhappi man seiz by the tentacl and fix to the
sucker wa balanc in the air at the capric of thi enorm trunk
he rattl in hi throat he wa stifl he cri help help these
word spoken in french startl me i had a fellowcountryman on
board perhap sever that heartrend cry i shall hear it all my
life the unfortun man wa lost who could rescu him from that
power pressur howev captain nemo had rush to the poulp and
with on blow of the ax had cut through on arm hi lieuten
struggl furious against other monster that crept on the flank of
the nautilu the crew fought with their ax the canadian conseil
and i buri our weapon in the fleshi mass a strong smell of musk
penetr the atmospher it wa horribl
for on instant i thought the unhappi man entangl with the poulp
would be torn from it power suction seven of the eight arm had
been cut off on onli wriggl in the air brandish the victim like
a feather but just as captain nemo and hi lieuten threw themselv
on it the anim eject a stream of black liquid we were blind
with it when the cloud dispers the cuttlefish had disappear and
my unfortun countryman with it ten or twelv poulp now invad the
platform and side of the nautilu we roll pellmel into the
midst of thi nest of serpent that wriggl on the platform in the
wave of blood and ink it seem as though these slimi tentacl
sprang up like the hydra head ned land harpoon at each stroke
wa plung into the stare ey of the cuttl fish but my bold
companion wa suddenli overturn by the tentacl of a monster he had
not been abl to avoid
ah how my heart beat with emot and horror the formid beak of a

chapter xix
the gulf stream
thi terribl scene of the 20th of april none of us can ever forget i
have written it under the influenc of violent emot sinc then i
have revis the recit i have read it to conseil and to the
canadian thei found it exact as to fact but insuffici as to
effect to paint such pictur on must have the pen of the most
illustri of our poet the author of the toiler of the deep
i have said that captain nemo wept while watch the wave hi grief
wa great it wa the second companion he had lost sinc our arriv on
board and what a death that friend crush stifl bruis by the
dread arm of a poulp pound by hi iron jaw would not rest with
hi comrad in the peac coral cemeteri in the midst of the
struggl it wa the despair cry utter by the unfortun man that
had torn my heart the poor frenchman forget hi convent
languag had taken to hi own mother tongu to utter a last appeal
amongst the crew of the nautilu associ with the bodi and soul
of the captain recoil like him from all contact with men i had a
fellowcountryman did he alon repres franc in thi mysteri
associ evid compos of individu of diver nation
it wa on of these insolubl problem that rose up unceasingli befor
my mind
captain nemo enter hi room and i saw him no more for some time but
that he wa sad and irresolut i could see by the vessel of which he
wa the soul and which receiv all hi impress the nautilu
did not keep on in it settl cours it float about like a corps
at the will of the wave it went at random he could not tear himself
awai from the scene of the last struggl from thi sea that had
devour on of hi men ten dai pass thu it wa not till the 1st
of mai that the nautilu resum it northerli cours after have
sight the bahama at the mouth of the bahama canal we were then
follow the current from the largest river to the sea that ha it
bank it fish and it proper temperatur i mean the gulf stream
it is realli a river that flow freeli to the middl of the atlant
and whose water do not mix with the ocean water it is a salt river
salter than the surround sea it mean depth is 1500 fathom it
mean breadth ten mile in certain place the current flow with the
speed of two mile and a half an hour the bodi of it water is more
consider than that of all the river in the globe it wa on thi
ocean river that the nautilu then sail
i must add that dure the night the phosphoresc water of the
gulf stream rival the electr power of our watchlight especi
in the stormi weather that threaten us so frequent mai 8th we
were still cross cape hattera at the height of the north carolin
the width of the gulf stream there is seventyf mile and it depth
210 yard the nautilu still went at random all supervis seem
abandon i thought that under these circumst escap would be
possibl inde the inhabit shore offer anywher an easi refug
the sea wa incessantli plough by the steamer that ply between new
york or boston and the gulf of mexico and overrun dai and night by the
littl schooner coast about the sever part of the american
coast we could hope to be pick up it wa a favour opportun
notwithstand the thirti mile that separ the nautilu from the
coast of the union on unfortun circumst thwart the
canadian plan the weather wa veri bad we were near those
shore where tempest ar so frequent that countri of waterspout and
cyclon actual engend by the current of the gulf stream to
tempt the sea in a frail boat wa certain destruct ned land own
thi himself he fret seiz with nostalgia that flight onli could
cure
master he said that dai to me thi must come to an end i must
make a clean breast of it thi nemo is leav land and go up to
the north but i declar to you that i have had enough of the south
pole and i will not follow him to the north
what is to be done ned sinc flight is impractic just now
we must speak to the captain said he you said noth when we were
in your nativ sea i will speak now we ar in mine when i think
that befor long the nautilu will be by nova scotia and that there
near new foundland is a larg bai and into that bai the st lawrenc
empti itself and that the st lawrenc is my river the river by
quebec my nativ townwhen i think of thi i feel furiou it make
my hair stand on end sir i would rather throw myself into the sea i
will not stai here i am stifl
the canadian wa evid lose all patienc hi vigor natur
could not stand thi prolong imprison hi face alter daili
hi temper becam more surli i knew what he must suffer for i wa
seiz with homesick myself nearli seven month had pass
without our have had ani new from land captain nemo isol
hi alter spirit especi sinc the fight with the poulp hi
taciturn all made me view thing in a differ light
well sir said ned see i did not repli
well ned do you wish me to ask captain nemo hi intent
concern us
ye sir
although he ha alreadi made them known
ye i wish it settl final speak for me in my name onli if you

but i so seldom meet him he avoid me
that is all the more reason for you to go to see him
i went to my room from thenc i meant to go to captain nemo it
would not do to let thi opportun of meet him slip i knock at
the door no answer i knock again then turn the handl the door

someth that ha escap me or ha the sea deliv up ani new
secret
we were at crosspurpos but befor i could repli he show me an
open manuscript on hi tabl and said in a more seriou tone here
m aronnax is a manuscript written in sever languag it contain
the sum of my studi of the sea and if it pleas god it shall not
perish with me thi manuscript sign with my name complet with the
histori of my life will be shut up in a littl float case the last
survivor of all of us on board the nautilu will throw thi case into
the sea and it will go whither it is born by the wave
thi man name hi histori written by himself hi mysteri would then
be reveal some dai
captain i said i can but approv of the idea that make you act
thu the result of your studi must not be lost but the mean you
emploi seem to me to be primit who know where the wind will carri
thi case and in whose hand it will fall could you not us some
other mean could not you or on of your

forget everyth like you i am will to live obscur in the frail
hope of bequeath on dai to futur time the result of my labour
but it is otherwis with ned land everi man worthi of the name
deserv some consider have you thought that love of liberti
hatr of slaveri can give rise to scheme of reveng in a natur like
the canadian that he could think attempt and try
i wa silenc captain nemo rose
whatev ned land think of attempt or tri what doe it matter
to me i did not seek him it is not for my pleasur that i keep him on
board as for you m aronnax you ar on of those who can understand
everyth even silenc i have noth more to sai to you let thi
first time you have come to treat of thi subject be the last for a
second time i will not listen to you
i retir our situat wa critic i relat my convers to my
two companion
we know now said ned that we can expect noth from thi man the
nautilu is near long island we will escap whatev the weather
mai be
but the sky becam more and more threaten symptom of a hurrican
becam manifest the atmospher wa becom white and misti on the

decompos under the influenc of the electr that pervad the
atmospher the tempest burst on the 18th of mai just as the
nautilu wa float off long island some mile from the port of
new york i can describ thi strife of the element for instead of
flee to the depth of the sea captain nemo by an unaccount
capric would brave it at the surfac the wind blew from the
southwest at first captain nemo dure the squall had taken hi
place on the platform he had made himself fast to prevent be
wash overboard by the monstrou wave i had hoist myself up and
made myself fast also divid my admir between the tempest and
thi extraordinari man who wa cope with it the rage sea wa swept
by huge clouddrift which were actual satur with the wave the
nautilu sometim ly on it side sometim stand up like a
mast roll and pitch terribl about five oclock a torrent of rain
fell that lull neither sea nor wind the hurri cane blew nearli
forti leagu an hour it is under these condit that it overturn

of yeddo in japan broke the same dai on the shore of america the
intens of the tempest increas with the night the baromet as in
1860 at reunion dure a cyclon fell sevententh at the close of

wa probabl on of the steamer of the line from new york to
liverpool or havr it soon disappear in the gloom at ten oclock
in the even the sky wa on fire the atmospher wa streak with
vivid lightn i could not bear the bright of it while the
captain look at it seem to envi the spirit of the tempest a
terribl nois fill the air a complex nois made up of the howl of
the crush wave the roar of the wind and the clap of thunder
the wind veer suddenli to all point of the horizon and the cyclon
rise in the east return after pass by the north west and
south in the invers cours pursu by the circular storm of the
southern hemispher ah that gulf stream it deserv it name of the
king of tempest it is that which caus those formid cyclon by
the differ of temperatur between it air and it current a
shower of fire had succeed the rain the drop of water were chang
to sharp spike on would have thought that captain nemo wa court
a death worthi of himself a death by lightn as the nautilu
pitch dreadfulli rais it steel spur in the air it seem to act
as a conductor and i saw long spark burst from it crush and
without strength i crawl to the panel open it and descend to
the saloon the storm wa then at it height it wa imposs to
stand upright in the interior of the nautilu captain nemo came down
about twelv i heard the reservoir fill by degre and the
nautilu sank slowli beneath the wave through the open window in
the saloon i saw larg fish terrifi pass like phantom in the
water some were struck befor my ey the nautilu wa still
descend i thought that at about eight fathom deep we should find a
calm but no the upper bed were too violent agit for that we
had to seek repos at more than twentyf fathom in the bowel of
the deep but there what quiet what silenc what peac who could
have told that such a hurrican had been let loos on the surfac of
that ocean
chapter xx
from latitud 47 24 to longitud 17 28
in consequ of the storm we had been thrown eastward onc more all
hope of escap on the shore of new york or st lawrenc had fade
awai and poor ned in despair had isol himself like captain nemo
conseil and i howev never left each other i said that the
nautilu had gone asid to the east i should have said to be more
exact the northeast for some dai it wander first on the surfac
and then beneath it amid those fog so dread by sailor what
accid ar due to these thick fog what shock upon these reef
when the wind drown the break of the wave what collis between
vessel in spite of their warn light whistl and alarm bell
and the bottom of these sea look like a field of battl where still
lie all the conquer of the ocean some old and alreadi encrust
other fresh and reflect from their iron band and copper plate the
brillianc of our lantern
on the 15th of mai we were at the extrem south of the bank of
newfoundland thi bank consist of alluvia or larg heap of organ
matter brought either from the equat by the gulf stream or from the
north pole by the countercurr of cold water which skirt the
american coast there also ar heap up those errat block which ar
carri along by the broken ic and close by a vast charnelhous of
mollusc which perish here by million the depth of the sea is not
great at newfoundlandnot more than some hundr of fathom but
toward the south is a depress of 1500 fathom there the gulf
stream widen it lose some of it speed and some of it temperatur
but it becom a sea
it wa on the 17th of mai about 500 mile from heart content at a
depth of more than 1400 fathom that i saw the electr cabl ly
on the bottom conseil to whom i had not mention it thought at
first that it wa a gigant seaserp but i undeceiv the worthi
fellow and by wai of consol relat sever particular in the
lai of thi cabl the first on wa laid in the year 1857 and
1858 but after transmit about 400 telegram would not act ani
longer in 1863 the engin construct an other on measur 2000
mile in length and weigh 4500 ton which wa embark on the
great eastern thi attempt also fail
on the 25th of mai the nautilu be at a depth of more than 1918
fathom wa on the precis spot where the ruptur occur which
ruin the enterpris it wa within 638 mile of the coast of ireland
and at halfpast two in the afternoon thei discov that
commun with europ had ceas the electrician on board
resolv to cut the cabl befor fish it up and at eleven oclock
at night thei had recov the damag part thei made anoth point
and splice it and it wa onc more submerg but some dai after it
broke again and in the depth of the ocean could not be recaptur
the american howev were not discourag cyru field the bold
promot of the enterpris as he had sunk all hi own fortun set a
new subscript on foot which wa at onc answer and anoth cabl
wa construct on better principl the bundl of conduct wire
were each envelop in guttapercha and protect by a wad of
hemp contain in a metal cover the great eastern sail on the
13th of juli 1866 the oper work well but on incid
occur sever time in unrol the cabl thei observ that nail
had recent been forc into it evid with the motiv of
destroi it captain anderson the offic and engin consult
togeth and had it post up that if the offend wa surpris on
board he would be thrown without further trial into the sea from that
time the crimin attempt wa never repeat
on the 23rd of juli the great eastern wa not more than 500 mile from
newfoundland when thei telegraph from ireland the new of the
armistic conclud between prussia and austria after sadowa on the
27th in the midst of heavi fog thei reach the port of heart
content the enterpris wa successfulli termin and for it first
despatch young america address old europ in these word of wisdom
so rare understood glori to god in the highest and on earth peac
goodwil toward men
i did not expect to find the electr cabl in it primit state
such as it wa on leav the manufactori the long serpent cover
with the remain of shell bristl with foraminifera wa encrust
with a strong coat which serv as a protect against all bore
mollusc it lai quietli shelter from the motion of the sea and
under a favour pressur for the transmiss of the electr spark
which pass from europ to america in 32 of a second doubtless thi
cabl will last for a great length of time for thei find that the
guttapercha cover is improv by the seawat besid on thi
level so well chosen the cabl is never so deepli submerg as to
caus it to break the nautilu follow it to the lowest depth
which wa more than 2212 fathom and there it lai without ani
anchorag and then we reach the spot where the accid had taken
place in 1863 the bottom of the ocean then form a vallei about 100
mile broad in which mont blanc might have been place without it
summit appear abov the wave thi vallei is close at the east by
a perpendicular wall more than 2000 yard high we arriv there on
the 28th of mai and the nautilu wa then not more than 120 mile
from ireland
wa captain nemo go to land on the british isl no to my great
surpris he made for the south onc more come back toward european
sea in round the emerald isl for on instant i caught sight of
cape clear and the light which guid the thousand of vessel leav
glasgow or liverpool an import question then aros in my mind did
the nautilu dare entangl itself in the manch ned land who had
reappear sinc we had been near land did not ceas to question
me how could i answer captain nemo remain invis after have
shown the canadian a glimps of american shore wa he go to show
me the coast of franc
but the nautilu wa still go southward on the 30th of mai it
pass in sight of land end between the extrem point of england and
the scilli isl which were left to starboard if we wish to enter
the manch he must go straight to the east he did not do so
dure the whole of the 31st of mai the nautilu describ a seri
of circl on the water which greatli interest me it seem to be
seek a spot it had some troubl in find at noon captain nemo
himself came to work the ship log he spoke no word to me but seem
gloomier than ever what could sadden him thu wa it hi proxim iti
to european shore had he some recollect of hi abandon countri
if not what did he feel remors or regret for a long while thi
thought haunt my mind and i had a kind of presenti that befor
long chanc would betrai the captain secret
the next dai the 1st of june the nautilu continu the same
process it wa evid seek some particular spot in the ocean
captain nemo took the sun altitud as he had done the dai befor the
sea wa beauti the sky clear about eight mile to the east a
larg steam vessel could be discern on the horizon no flag flutter
from it mast and i could not discov it nation some minut
befor the sun pass the meridian captain nemo took hi sextant and
watch with great attent the perfect rest of the water greatli
help the oper the nautilu wa motionless it neither roll
nor pitch
i wa on the platform when the altitud wa taken and the captain
pronounc these word it is here
he turn and went below had he seen the vessel which wa chang it
cours and seem to be near us i could not tell i return to the
saloon the panel close i heard the hiss of the water in the
reservoir the nautilu began to sink follow a vertic line
for it screw commun no motion to it some minut later it
stop at a depth of more than 420 fathom rest on the ground the
lumin ceil wa darken then the panel were open and through
the glass i saw the sea brilliantli illumin by the rai of our
lantern for at least half a mile round us
i look to the port side and saw noth but an immens of quiet
water but to starboard on the bottom appear a larg protuber
which at onc attract my attent on would have thought it a ruin
buri under a coat of white shell much resembl a cover of
snow upon examin the mass attent i could recognis the
everthicken form of a vessel bare of it mast which must have
sunk it certainli belong to past time thi wreck to be thu
encrust with the lime of the water must alreadi be abl to count
mani year pass at the bottom of the ocean
what wa thi vessel why did the nautilu visit it tomb could it
have been aught but a shipwreck which had drawn it under the water i
knew not what to think when near me in a slow voic i heard captain

chapter xxi
a hecatomb
the wai of describ thi unlookedfor scene the histori of the
patriot ship told at first so coldli and the emot with which thi
strang man pronounc the last word the name of the aveng the
signific of which could not escap me all impress itself deepli
on my mind my ey did not leav the captain who with hi hand
stretch out to sea wa watch with a glow ey the gloriou
wreck perhap i wa never to know who he wa from whenc he came or
where he wa go to but i saw the man move and apart from the
savant it wa no common misanthropi which had shut captain nemo and
hi companion within the nautilu but a hatr either monstrou or
sublim which time could never weaken did thi hatr still seek for
vengeanc the futur would soon teach me that but the nautilu wa
rise slowli to the surfac of the sea and the form of the aveng
disappear by degre from my sight soon a slight roll told me
that we were in the open air at that moment a dull boom wa heard i
look at the captain he did not move
captain said i
he did not answer i left him and mount the platform conseil and the
canadian were alreadi there
where did that sound come from i ask
it wa a gunshot repli ned land
i look in the direct of the vessel i had alreadi seen it wa
near the nautilu and we could see that it wa put on steam
it wa within six mile of us
what is that ship ned
by it rig and the height of it lower mast said the canadian
i bet she is a shipofwar mai it reach us and if necessari sink
thi curs nautilu
friend ned repli conseil what harm can it do to the nautilu
can it attack it beneath the wave can it cannonad us at the bottom
of the sea
tell me ned said i can you recognis what countri she belong
to
the canadian knit hi eyebrow drop hi eyelid and screw up
the corner of hi ey and for a few moment fix a pierc look
upon the vessel
no sir he repli i cannot tell what nation she belong to for
she show no colour but i can declar she is a manofwar for a long
pennant flutter from her main mast
for a quarter of an hour we watch the ship which wa steam toward
us i could not howev believ that she could see the nautilu
from that distanc and still less that she could know what thi
submarin engin wa soon the canadian inform me that she wa a
larg armour twodeck ram a thick black smoke wa pour from
her two funnel her closelyfurl sail were stop to her yard
she hoist no flag at her mizzenpeak the distanc prevent us from
distinguish the colour of her pennant which float like a thin
ribbon she advanc rapidli if captain nemo allow her to approach
there wa a chanc of salvat for us
sir said ned land if that vessel pass within a mile of us i
shall throw myself into the sea and i should advis you to do the
same
i did not repli to the canadian suggest but continu watch
the ship whether english french american or russian she would be
sure to take us in if we could onli reach her present a white smoke
burst from the fore part of the vessel some second after the water
agit by the fall of a heavi bodi splash the stern of the
nautilu and shortli afterward a loud explos struck my ear
what thei ar fire at us i exclaim
so pleas you sir said ned thei have recognis the unicorn and
thei ar fire at us
but i exclaim sure thei can see that there ar men in the
case
it is perhap becaus of that repli ned land look at me
a whole flood of light burst upon my mind doubtless thei knew now how
to believ the stori of the pretend monster no doubt on board the
abraham lincoln when the canadian struck it with the harpoon
command farragut had recognis in the suppos narwhal a submarin
vessel more danger than a supernatur cetacean ye it must have
been so and on everi sea thei were now seek thi engin of
destruct terribl inde if as we suppos captain nemo emploi
the nautilu in work of vengeanc on the night when we were
imprison in that cell in the midst of the indian ocean had he not
attack some vessel the man buri in the coral cemeteri had he not
been a victim to the shock caus by the nautilu ye i repeat it
it must be so on part of the mysteri exist of captain nemo had
been unveil and if hi ident had not been recognis at least
the nation unit against him were no longer hunt a chimer
creatur but a man who had vow a deadli hatr against them all the
formid past rose befor me instead of meet friend on board the
approach ship we could onli expect pitiless enemi but the shot
rattl about us some of them struck the sea and ricochet lose
themselv in the distanc but none touch the nautilu the vessel
wa not more than three mile from us in spite of the seriou
cannonad captain nemo did not appear on the platform but if on of
the conic projectil had struck the shell of the nautilu it
would have been fatal the canadian then said sir we must do all we
can to get out of thi dilemma let us signal them thei will then
perhap understand that we ar honest folk
ned land took hi handkerchief to wave in the air but he had scarc
displai it when he wa struck down by an iron hand and fell in
spite of hi great strength upon the deck
fool exclaim the captain do you wish to be pierc by the spur
of the nautilu befor it is hurl at thi vessel
captain nemo wa terribl to hear he wa still more terribl to see
hi face wa deadli pale with a spasm at hi heart for an instant it
must have ceas to beat hi pupil were fearfulli contract he did
not speak he roar as with hi bodi thrown forward he wrung the
canadian shoulder then leav him and turn to the ship of
war whose shot wa still rain around him he exclaim with a
power voic ah ship of an accurs nation you know who i am i
do not want your colour to know you by look and i will show you
mine
and on the fore part of the platform captain nemo unfurl a black
flag similar to the on he had place at the south pole at that
moment a shot struck the shell of the nautilu obliqu without
pierc it and rebound near the captain wa lost in the sea he
shrug hi shoulder and address me said shortli go down you
and your companion go down
sir i cri ar you go to attack thi vessel
sir i am go to sink it
you will not do that
i shall do it he repli coldli and i advis you not to judg me
sir fate ha shown you what you ought not to have seen the attack ha
begun go down
what is thi vessel
you do not know veri well so much the better it nation to
you at least will be a secret go down
we could but obei about fifteen of the sailor surround the captain
look with implac hatr at the vessel near them on could
feel that the same desir of vengeanc anim everi soul i went down
at the moment anoth projectil struck the nautilu and i heard the
captain exclaim
strike mad vessel shower your useless shot and then you will not
escap the spur of the nautilu but it is not here that you shall
perish i would not have your ruin mingl with those of the aveng
i reach my room the captain and hi second had remain on the
platform the screw wa set in motion and the nautilu move with
speed wa soon beyond the reach of the ship gun but the pursuit
continu and captain nemo content himself with keep hi
distanc
about four in the afternoon be no longer abl to contain my
impati i went to the central staircas the panel wa open and i
ventur on to the platform the captain wa still walk up and down
with an agit step he wa look at the ship which wa five or
six mile to leeward
he wa go round it like a wild beast and draw it eastward he
allow them to pursu but he did not attack perhap he still
hesit i wish to mediat onc more but i had scarc spoken
when captain nemo impos silenc sai
i am the law and i am the judg i am the oppress and there is the
oppressor through him i have lost all that i love cherish and
veneratedcountri wife children father and mother i saw all
perish all that i hate is there sai no more
i cast a last look at the manofwar which wa put on steam and
rejoin ned and conseil
we will fly i exclaim
good said ned what is thi vessel
i do not know but whatev it is it will be sunk befor night in
ani case it is better to perish with it than be made accomplic in a
retali the justic of which we cannot judg
that is my opinion too said ned land coolli let us wait for
night
night arriv deep silenc reign on board the compass show that
the nautilu had not alter it cours it wa on the surfac
roll slightli my companion and i resolv to fly when the vessel
should be near enough either to hear us or to see us for the moon
which would be full in two or three dai shone brightli onc on board
the ship if we could not prevent the blow which threaten it we
could at least we would do all that circumst would allow
sever time i thought the nautilu wa prepar for attack but
captain nemo content himself with allow hi adversari to approach
and then fled onc more befor it
part of the night pass without ani incid we watch the
opportun for action we spoke littl for we were too much move
ned land would have thrown himself into the sea but i forc him to
wait accord to my idea the nautilu would attack the ship at her
waterlin and then it would not onli be possibl but easi to fly
at three in the morn full of uneasi i mount the platform
captain nemo had not left it he wa stand at the fore part near hi
flag which a slight breez displai abov hi head he did not take
hi ey from the vessel the intens of hi look seem to attract
and fascin and draw it onward more sure than if he had been
tow it the moon wa then pass the meridian jupit wa rise
in the east amid thi peac scene of natur sky and ocean rival
each other in tranquil the sea offer to the orb of night the
finest mirror thei could ever have in which to reflect their imag as
i thought of the deep calm of these element compar with all those
passion brood impercept within the nautilu i shudder
the vessel wa within two mile of us it wa ever near that
phosphoresc light which show the presenc of the nautilu i
could see it green and red light and it white lantern hang from
the larg foremast an indistinct vibrat quiver through it
rig show that the furnac were heat to the uttermost
sheav of spark and red ash flew from the funnel shine in the
atmospher like star
i remain thu until six in the morn without captain nemo notic
me the ship stood about a mile and a half from us and with the first
dawn of dai the fire began afresh the moment could not be far off
when the nautilu attack it adversari my companion and myself
should for ever leav thi man i wa prepar to go down to remind
them when the second mount the platform accompani by sever
sailor captain nemo either did not or would not see them some step
were taken which might be call the signal for action thei were veri
simpl the iron balustrad around the platform wa lower and the
lantern and pilot cage were push within the shell until thei were
flush with the deck the long surfac of the steel cigar no longer
offer a singl point to check it manuvr i return to the
saloon the nautilu still float some streak of light were
filter through the liquid bed with the undul of the wave
the window were brighten by the red streak of the rise sun and
thi dread dai of the 2nd of june had dawn
at five oclock the log show that the speed of the nautilu wa
slacken and i knew that it wa allow them to draw nearer
besid the report were heard more distinctli and the projectil
labour through the ambient water were extinguish with a strang
hiss nois
my friend said i the moment is come on grasp of the hand and
mai god protect us
ned land wa resolut conseil calm myself so nervou that i knew not
how to contain myself we all pass into the librari but the moment i
push the door open on to the central staircas i heard the upper
panel close sharpli the canadian rush on to the stair but i
stop him a wellknown hiss nois told me that the water wa
run into the reservoir and in a few minut the nautilu wa
some yard beneath the surfac of the wave i understood the manuvr
it wa too late to act the nautilu did not wish to strike at the
impenetr cuirass but below the waterlin where the metal
cover no longer protect it
we were again imprison unwil wit of the dread drama
that wa prepar we had scarc time to reflect take refug in
my room we look at each other without speak a deep stupor had
taken hold of my mind thought seem to stand still i wa in that
pain state of expect preced a dread report i wait i
listen everi sens wa merg in that of hear the speed of the
nautilu wa acceler it wa prepar to rush the whole ship
trembl suddenli i scream i felt the shock but compar
light i felt the penetr power of the steel spur i heard
rattl and scrape but the nautilu carri along by it
propel power pass through the mass of the vessel like a needl
through sailcloth
i could stand it no longer mad out of my mind i rush from my room
into the saloon captain nemo wa there mute gloomi implac he
wa look through the port panel a larg mass cast a shadow on the
water and that it might lose noth of her agoni the nautilu wa
go down into the abyss with her ten yard from me i saw the open
shell through which the water wa rush with the nois of thunder
then the doubl line of gun and the net the bridg wa cover
with black agit shadow
the water wa rise the poor creatur were crowd the ratlin
cling to the mast struggl under the water it wa a human
antheap overtaken by the sea paralys stiffen with anguish my
hair stand on end with ey wide open pant without breath and
without voic i too wa watch an irresist attract glu me
to the glass suddenli an explos took place the compress air blew
up her deck as if the magazin had caught fire then the unfortun
vessel sank more rapidli her topmast laden with victim now
appear then her spar bend under the weight of men and last of
all the top of her mainmast then the dark mass disappear and with
it the dead crew drawn down by the strong eddi
illustr the unfortun vessel sank more rapidli
i turn to captain nemo that terribl aveng a perfect archangel of
hatr wa still look when all wa over he turn to hi room
open the door and enter i follow him with my ey on the end
wall beneath hi hero i saw the portrait of a woman still young
and two littl children captain nemo look at them for some moment
stretch hi arm toward them and kneel down burst into deep
sob
chapter xxii
the last word of captain nemo
the panel had close on thi dread vision but light had not
return to the saloon all wa silenc and dark within the
nautilu at wonder speed a hundr feet beneath the water it
wa leav thi desol spot whither wa it go to the north or
south where wa the man fly to after such dread retali i
had return to my room where ned and conseil had remain silent
enough i felt an insurmount horror for captain nemo whatev he
had suffer at the hand of these men he had no right to punish thu
he had made me if not an accomplic at least a wit of hi
vengeanc at eleven the electr light reappear i pass into the
saloon it wa desert i consult the differ instrument the
nautilu wa fly northward at the rate of twentyf mile an
hour now on the surfac and now thirti feet below it on take the
bear by the chart i saw that we were pass the mouth of the
manch and that our cours wa hurri us toward the northern sea
at a fright speed that night we had cross two hundr leagu of
the atlant the shadow fell and the sea wa cover with dark
until the rise of the moon i went to my room but could not sleep i
wa troubl with dread nightmar the horribl scene of destruct
wa continu befor my ey from that dai who could tell into what
part of the north atlant basin the nautilu would take us still
with unaccount speed still in the midst of these northern fog
would it touch at spitzbergen or on the shore of nova zembla should
we explor those unknown sea the white sea the sea of kara the gulf
of obi the archipelago of liarrov and the unknown coast of asia i
could not sai i could no longer judg of the time that wa pass
the clock had been stop on board it seem as in polar countri
that night and dai no longer follow their regular cours i felt
myself be drawn into that strang region where the founder
imagin of edgar poe roam at will like the fabul gordon pym
at everi moment i expect to see that veil human figur of larger
proport than those of ani inhabit of the earth thrown across
the cataract which defend the approach to the pole i estim
though perhap i mai be mistakeni estim thi adventur
cours of the nautilu to have last fifteen or twenti dai and i
know not how much longer it might have last had it not been for the
catastroph which end thi voyag of captain nemo i saw noth
whatev now nor of hi second not a man of the crew wa visibl for
an instant the nautilu wa almost incessantli under water when we
came to the surfac to renew the air the panel open and shut
mechan there were no more mark on the planispher i knew not
where we were and the canadian too hi strength and patienc at an
end appear no more conseil could not draw a word from him and
fear that in a dread fit of mad he might kill himself
watch him with constant devot on morn what date it wa i
could not sai i had fallen into a heavi sleep toward the earli hour
a sleep both pain and unhealthi when i suddenli awok ned land wa
lean over me sai in a low voic we ar go to fly i sat

mile to the east
what countri is it
i do not know but whatev it is we will take refug there
ye ned ye we will fly tonight even if the sea should swallow us

the sea is bad the wind violent but twenti mile in that light boat
of the nautilu doe not frighten me unknown to the crew i have
been abl to procur food and some bottl of water
i will follow you
but continu the canadian if i am surpris i will defend
myself i will forc them to kill me
we will die togeth friend ned
i had made up my mind to all the canadian left me i reach the
platform on which i could with difficulti support myself against the
shock of the wave the sky wa threaten but as land wa in those
thick brown shadow we must fly i return to the saloon fear and
yet hope to see captain nemo wish and yet not wish to see him
what could i have said to him could i hide the involuntari horror with
which he inspir me no it wa better that i should not meet him face
to face better to forget him and yet how long seem that dai the
last that i should pass in the nautilu i remain alon ned land
and conseil avoid speak for fear of betrai themselv at six
i dine but i wa not hungri i forc myself to eat in spite of my
disgust that i might not weaken myself at halfpast six ned land came

departur at ten the moon will not be risen we will profit by the
dark come to the boat conseil and i will wait for you
the canadian went out without give me time to answer wish to
verifi the cours of the nautilu i went to the saloon we were
run nne at fright speed and more than fifti yard deep i
cast a last look on these wonder of natur on the rich of art
heap up in thi museum upon the unrival collect destin to
perish at the bottom of the sea with him who had form it i wish
to fix an indel impress of it in my mind i remain an hour
thu bath in the light of that lumin ceil and pass in
review those treasur shine under their glass then i return to
my room
i dress myself in strong sea cloth i collect my note place
them carefulli about me my heart beat loudli i could not check it
pulsat certainli my troubl and agit would have betrai me
to captain nemo ey what wa he do at thi moment i listen at
the door of hi room i heard step captain nemo wa there he had not
gone to rest at everi moment i expect to see him appear and ask me
why i wish to fly i wa constantli on the alert my imagin
magnifi everyth the impress becam at last so poignant that i
ask myself if it would not be better to go to the captain room see
him face to face and brave him with look and gestur
it wa the inspir of a madman fortun i resist the desir
and stretch myself on my bed to quiet my bodili agit my nerv
were somewhat calmer but in my excit brain i saw over again all my
exist on board the nautilu everi incid either happi or
unfortun which had happen sinc my disappear from the
abraham lincolnth submarin hunt the torr strait the savag

iceberg the south pole the imprison in the ic the fight among
the poulp the storm in the gulf stream the aveng and the horribl
scene of the vessel sunk with all her crew all these event pass
befor my ey like scene in a drama then captain nemo seem to grow
enorm hi featur to assum superhuman proport he wa no
longer my equal but a man of the water the geni of the sea
it wa then halfpast nine i held my head between my hand to keep it
from burst i close my ey i would not think ani longer there
wa anoth halfhour to wait anoth halfhour of a nightmar which
might drive me mad
at that moment i heard the distant strain of the organ a sad harmoni
to an undefin chant the wail of a soul long to break these
earthli bond i listen with everi sens scarc breath
plung like captain nemo in that music ecstasi which wa draw
him in spirit to the end of life
then a sudden thought terrifi me captain nemo had left hi room he
wa in the saloon which i must cross to fly there i should meet him
for the last time he would see me perhap speak to me a gestur of
hi might destroi me a singl word chain me on board
but ten wa about to strike the moment had come for me to leav my
room and join my companion
i must not hesit even if captain nemo himself should rise befor
me i open my door carefulli and even then as it turn on it
hing it seem to me to make a dread nois perhap it onli
exist in my own imagin
i crept along the dark stair of the nautilu stop at each step
to check the beat of my heart i reach the door of the saloon and
open it gentli it wa plung in profound dark the strain of
the organ sound faintli captain nemo wa there he did not see me
in the full light i do not think he would have notic me so entir
wa he absorb in the ecstasi
i crept along the carpet avoid the slightest sound which might
betrai my presenc i wa at least five minut reach the door at
the opposit side open into the librari
i wa go to open it when a sigh from captain nemo nail me to the
spot i knew that he wa rise i could even see him for the light
from the librari came through to the saloon he came toward me
silent with hi arm cross glide like a spectr rather than
walk hi breast wa swell with sob and i heard him murmur
these word the last which ever struck my ear
almighti god enough enough
wa it a confess of remors which thu escap from thi man
conscienc
in desper i rush through the librari mount the central
staircas and follow the upper flight reach the boat i crept
through the open which had alreadi admit my two companion
let us go let us go i exclaim
directli repli the canadian
the orific in the plate of the nautilu wa first close and
fasten down by mean of a fals kei with which ned land had provid
himself the open in the boat wa also close the canadian began to
loosen the bolt which still held us to the submarin boat
suddenli a nois wa heard voic were answer each other loudli
what wa the matter had thei discov our flight i felt ned land
slip a dagger into my hand
ye i murmur we know how to die
the canadian had stop in hi work but on word mani time repeat
a dread word reveal the caus of the agit spread on board
the nautilu it wa not we the crew were look after
the maelstrom the maelstrom could a more dread word in a more
dread situat have sound in our ear we were then upon the
danger coast of norwai wa the nautilu be drawn into thi
gulf at the moment our boat wa go to leav it side we knew that
at the tide the pentup water between the island of ferro and
loffoden rush with irresist violenc form a whirlpool from
which no vessel ever escap from everi point of the horizon enorm
wave were meet form a gulf justli call the navel of the
ocean whose power of attract extend to a distanc of twelv
mile there not onli vessel but whale ar sacrif as well as
white bear from the northern region
it is thither that the nautilu voluntarili or involuntarili had
been run by the captain
it wa describ a spiral the circumfer of which wa lessen by
degre and the boat which wa still fasten to it side wa
carri along with giddi speed i felt that sickli giddi which
aris from longcontinu whirl round
we were in dread our horror wa at it height circul had
stop all nervou influenc wa annihil and we were cover
with cold sweat like a sweat of agoni and what nois around our frail
bark what roar repeat by the echo mile awai what an uproar wa
that of the water broken on the sharp rock at the bottom where the
hardest bodi ar crush and tree worn awai with all the fur
rub off accord to the norwegian phrase
what a situat to be in we rock frightfulli the nautilu
defend itself like a human be it steel muscl crack
sometim it seem to stand upright and we with it
we must hold on said ned and look after the bolt we mai still be
save if we stick to the nautilu
he had not finish the word when we heard a crash nois the
bolt gave wai and the boat torn from it groov wa hurl like a
stone from a sling into the midst of the whirlpool
my head struck on a piec of iron and with the violent shock i lost
all conscious
chapter xxiii
conclus
thu end the voyag under the sea what pass dure that nighthow
the boat escap from the eddi of the maelstromhow ned land
conseil and myself ever came out of the gulf i cannot tell
but when i return to conscious i wa ly in a fisherman hut
on the loffoden isl my two companion safe and sound were near me
hold my hand we embrac each other heartili
at that moment we could not think of return to franc the mean of
commun between the north of norwai and the south ar rare and i
am therefor oblig to wait for the steamboat run monthli from
cape north
and among the worthi peopl who have so kindli receiv us i revis
my record of these adventur onc more not a fact ha been omit
not a detail exagger it is a faith narr of thi incred
expedit in an element inaccess to man but to which progress
will on dai open a road
shall i be believ i do not know and it matter littl after all
what i now affirm is that i have a right to speak of these sea under
which in less than ten month i have cross 20000 leagu in that
submarin tour of the world which ha reveal so mani wonder
but what ha becom of the nautilu did it resist the pressur of
the maelstrom doe captain nemo still live and doe he still follow
under the ocean those fright retali or did he stop after the
last hecatomb
will the wave on dai carri to him thi manuscript contain the
histori of hi life shall i ever know the name of thi man will the
miss vessel tell us by it nation that of captain nemo
i hope so and i also hope that hi power vessel ha conquer the
sea at it most terribl gulf and that the nautilu ha surviv
