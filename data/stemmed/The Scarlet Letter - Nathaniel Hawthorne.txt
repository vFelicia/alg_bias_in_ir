introductori to the scarlet letter
it is a littl remark thatthough disinclin to talk overmuch of
myself and my affair at the firesid and to my person friendsan
autobiograph impuls should twice in my life have taken possess
of me in address the public the first time wa three or four year
sinc when i favour the readerinexcus and for no earthli
reason that either the indulg reader or the intrus author could
imaginewith a descript of my wai of life in the deep quietud of an
old mans and nowbecaus beyond my desert i wa happi enough to
find a listen or two on the former occasioni again seiz the public
by the button and talk of my three year experi in a
customhous the exampl of the famou p p clerk of thi parish
wa never more faithfulli follow the truth seem to be howev
that when he cast hi leav forth upon the wind the author
address not the mani who will fling asid hi volum or never take
it up but the few who will understand him better than most of hi
schoolmat or lifem some author inde do far more than thi
and indulg themselv in such confidenti depth of revel as
could fittingli be address onli and exclus to the on heart and
mind of perfect sympathi as if the print book thrown at larg on
the wide world were certain to find out the divid segment of the
writer own natur and complet hi circl of exist by bring
him into communion with it it is scarc decor howev to speak
all even where we speak imperson but as thought ar frozen and
utter benumb unless the speaker stand in some true relat with
hi audienc it mai be pardon to imagin that a friend a kind and
apprehens though not the closest friend is listen to our talk
and then a nativ reserv be thaw by thi genial conscious
we mai prate of the circumst that lie around us and even of
ourself but still keep the inmost me behind it veil to thi extent
and within these limit an author methink mai be autobiograph
without violat either the reader right or hi own
it will be seen likewis that thi customhous sketch ha a certain
proprieti of a kind alwai recognis in literatur as explain how
a larg portion of the follow page came into my possess and as
offer proof of the authent of a narr therein contain
thi in facta desir to put myself in my true posit as editor or
veri littl more of the most prolix among the tale that make up my
volumethi and no other is my true reason for assum a person

appear allow by a few extra touch to give a faint
represent of a mode of life not heretofor describ togeth
with some of the charact that move in it among whom the author
happen to make on
in my nativ town of salem at the head of what half a centuri ago in
the dai of old king derbi wa a bustl wharfbut which is now

thi old town of salemmi nativ place though i have dwelt much awai
from it both in boyhood and matur yearspossess or did possess a
hold on my affect the forc of which i have never realiz dure
my season of actual resid here inde so far as it physic
aspect is concern with it flat unvari surfac cover chiefli
with wooden hous few or none of which pretend to architectur
beautyit irregular which is neither picturesqu nor quaint but
onli tameit long and lazi street loung wearisom through the
whole extent of the peninsula with gallow hill and new guinea at on
end and a view of the almshous at the othersuch be the featur
of my nativ town it would be quit as reason to form a
sentiment attach to a disarrang checkerboard and yet though
invari happiest elsewher there is within me a feel for old
salem which in lack of a better phrase i must be content to call
affect the sentiment is probabl assign to the deep and ag
root which my famili ha stuck into the soil it is now nearli two
centuri and a quarter sinc the origin briton the earliest
emigr of my name made hi appear in the wild and
forestbord settlement which ha sinc becom a citi and here hi
descend have been born and di and have mingl their earthli
substanc with the soil until no small portion of it must necessarili
be akin to the mortal frame wherewith for a littl while i walk the
street in part therefor the attach which i speak of is the
mere sensuou sympathi of dust for dust few of my countrymen can know
what it is nor as frequent transplant is perhap better for the
stock need thei consid it desir to know
but the sentiment ha likewis it moral qualiti the figur of that
first ancestor invest by famili tradit with a dim and duski
grandeur wa present to my boyish imagin as far back as i can
rememb it still haunt me and induc a sort of homefeel with
the past which i scarc claim in refer to the present phase of
the town i seem to have a stronger claim to a resid here on
account of thi grave beard sablecloak and steeplecrown
progenitorwho came so earli with hi bibl and hi sword and trode
the unworn street with such a state port and made so larg a figur
as a man of war and peacea stronger claim than for myself whose name
is seldom heard and my face hardli known he wa a soldier legisl
judg he wa a ruler in the church he had all the puritan trait
both good and evil he wa likewis a bitter persecutor as wit the
quaker who have rememb him in their histori and relat an
incid of hi hard sever toward a woman of their sect which will
last longer it is to be fear than ani record of hi better deed
although these were mani hi son too inherit the persecut
spirit and made himself so conspicu in the martyrdom of the
witch that their blood mai fairli be said to have left a stain upon
him so deep a stain inde that hi dry old bone in the
charterstreet burialground must still retain it if thei have not
crumbl utterli to dust i know not whether these ancestor of mine
bethought themselv to repent and ask pardon of heaven for their
cruelti or whether thei ar now groan under the heavi
consequ of them in anoth state of be at all event i the
present writer as their repres herebi take shame upon myself
for their sake and prai that ani curs incur by thema i have
heard and as the dreari and unprosper condit of the race for
mani a long year back would argu to existmai be now and henceforth
remov
doubtless howev either of these stern and blackbrow puritan
would have thought it quit a suffici retribut for hi sin that
after so long a laps of year the old trunk of the famili tree with
so much vener moss upon it should have born as it topmost
bough an idler like myself no aim that i have ever cherish would
thei recognis as laudabl no success of mineif my life beyond it
domest scope had ever been brighten by successwould thei deem
otherwis than worthless if not posit disgrac what is he
murmur on grei shadow of my forefath to the other a writer of
stori book what kind of busi in lifewhat mode of glorifi god
or be servic to mankind in hi dai and generationmai that be
why the degener fellow might as well have been a fiddler such ar
the compliment bandi between my great grandsir and myself across
the gulf of time and yet let them scorn me as thei will strong
trait of their natur have intertwin themselv with mine
plant deep in the town earliest infanc and childhood by these
two earnest and energet men the race ha ever sinc subsist here
alwai too in respect never so far as i have known
disgrac by a singl unworthi member but seldom or never on the
other hand after the first two gener perform ani memor
deed or so much as put forward a claim to public notic
gradual thei have sunk almost out of sight as old hous here and
there about the street get cover halfwai to the eav by the
accumul of new soil from father to son for abov a hundr
year thei follow the sea a greyhead shipmast in each

grandsir the boi also in due time pass from the forecastl to the
cabin spent a tempestu manhood and return from hi

natal earth thi long connexion of a famili with on spot as it
place of birth and burial creat a kindr between the human be

moral circumst that surround him it is not love but instinct the
new inhabitantwho came himself from a foreign land or whose father or
grandfath cameha littl claim to be call a salemit he ha no
concept of the oysterlik tenac with which an old settler over
whom hi third centuri is creep cling to the spot where hi

place is joyless for him that he is weari of the old wooden hous

wind and the chillest of social atmospheresal these and whatev
fault besid he mai see or imagin ar noth to the purpos the
spell surviv and just as powerfulli as if the natal spot were an
earthli paradis so ha it been in my case i felt it almost as a
destini to make salem my home so that the mould of featur and cast
of charact which had all along been familiar hereev as on
repres of the race lai down in the grave anoth assum as
it were hi sentrymarch along the main streetmight still in my
littl dai be seen and recognis in the old town nevertheless thi
veri sentiment is an evid that the connexion which ha becom an
unhealthi on should at last be sever human natur will not
flourish ani more than a potato if it be plant and replant for
too long a seri of gener in the same wornout soil my
children have had other birthplac and so far as their fortun mai
be within my control shall strike their root into unaccustom earth
on emerg from the old mans it wa chiefli thi strang indol
unjoy attach for my nativ town that brought me to fill a place
in uncl sam brick edific when i might as well or better have
gone somewher els my doom wa on me it wa not the first time nor
the second that i had gone awaya it seem permanentlybut yet
return like the bad halfpenni or as if salem were for me the
inevit centr of the univers so on fine morn i ascend the
flight of granit step with the presid commiss in my pocket
and wa introduc to the corp of gentlemen who were to aid me in my
weighti respons as chief execut offic of the customhous
i doubt greatlyor rather i do not doubt at allwheth ani public
functionari of the unit state either in the civil or militari line
ha ever had such a patriarch bodi of veteran under hi order as
myself the whereabout of the oldest inhabit wa at onc settl
when i look at them for upward of twenti year befor thi epoch

customhous out of the whirlpool of polit vicissitud which make

might have brought unquestion improv thu on take charg
of my depart i found few but ag men thei were ancient
seacaptain for the most part who after be toss on everi sea
and stand up sturdili against life tempestu blast had final
drift into thi quiet nook where with littl to disturb them
except the period terror of a presidenti elect thei on and
all acquir a new leas of exist though by no mean less liabl
than their fellowmen to ag and infirm thei had evid some
talisman or other that kept death at bai two or three of their number
as i wa assur be gouti and rheumat or perhap bedridden
never dream of make their appear at the customhous dure a
larg part of the year but after a torpid winter would creep out
into the warm sunshin of mai or june go lazili about what thei term
duti and at their own leisur and conveni betak themselv to
bed again i must plead guilti to the charg of abbrevi the
offici breath of more than on of these vener servant of the
republ thei were allow on my represent to rest from their
arduou labour and soon afterwardsa if their sole principl of life
had been zeal for their countri servicea i verili believ it
waswithdrew to a better world it is a piou consol to me that
through my interfer a suffici space wa allow them for
repent of the evil and corrupt practic into which as a matter of
cours everi customhous offic must be suppos to fall neither
the front nor the back entranc of the customhous open on the road
to paradis
the greater part of my offic were whig it wa well for their
vener brotherhood that the new surveyor wa not a politician and
though a faith democrat in principl neither receiv nor held hi
offic with ani refer to polit servic had it been
otherwisehad an activ politician been put into thi influenti post
to assum the easi task of make head against a whig collector whose
infirm withheld him from the person administr of hi
officehardli a man of the old corp would have drawn the breath of
offici life within a month after the extermin angel had come up
the customhous step accord to the receiv code in such matter
it would have been noth short of duti in a politician to bring
everi on of those white head under the ax of the guillotin it wa
plain enough to discern that the old fellow dread some such
discourtesi at my hand it pain and at the same time amus me to
behold the terror that attend my advent to see a furrow cheek
weatherbeaten by half a centuri of storm turn ashi pale at the glanc
of so harmless an individu as myself to detect as on or anoth
address me the tremor of a voic which in longpast dai had been
wont to bellow through a speakingtrumpet hoars enough to frighten
borea himself to silenc thei knew these excel old person
that by all establish ruleand as regard some of them weigh by
their own lack of effici for businessthei ought to have given
place to younger men more orthodox in polit and altogeth fitter
than themselv to serv our common uncl i knew it too but could
never quit find in my heart to act upon the knowledg much and
deservedli to my own discredit therefor and consider to the
detriment of my offici conscienc thei continu dure my
incumb to creep about the wharv and loiter up and down the
customhous step thei spent a good deal of time also asleep in
their accustom corner with their chair tilt back against the
wall awak howev onc or twice in the forenoon to bore on
anoth with the sever thousandth repetit of old seastori and
mouldi joke that had grown to be password and countersign among
them
the discoveri wa soon made i imagin that the new surveyor had no
great harm in him so with lightsom heart and the happi
conscious of be usefulli employedin their own behalf at least
if not for our belov countrythes good old gentlemen went through
the variou formal of offic sagaci under their spectacl
did thei peep into the hold of vessel mighti wa their fuss about
littl matter and marvel sometim the obtus that allow
greater on to slip between their finger whenev such a mischanc
occurredwhen a waggonload of valuabl merchandis had been smuggl
ashor at noondai perhap and directli beneath their unsuspici
nosesnoth could exce the vigil and alacr with which thei
proceed to lock and doublelock and secur with tape and
sealingwax all the avenu of the delinqu vessel instead of a
reprimand for their previou neglig the case seem rather to
requir an eulogium on their praiseworthi caution after the mischief
had happen a grate recognit of the promptitud of their zeal
the moment that there wa no longer ani remedi
unless peopl ar more than commonli disagre it is my foolish
habit to contract a kind for them the better part of my
companion charact if it have a better part is that which usual
come uppermost in my regard and form the type wherebi i recognis
the man as most of these old customhous offic had good trait
and as my posit in refer to them be patern and protect
wa favour to the growth of friendli sentiment i soon grew to
like them all it wa pleasant in the summer forenoonswhen the fervent
heat that almost liquefi the rest of the human famili mere
commun a genial warmth to their half torpid systemsit wa
pleasant to hear them chat in the back entri a row of them all
tip against the wall as usual while the frozen wittic of past
gener were thaw out and came bubbl with laughter from their
lip extern the jolliti of ag men ha much in common with the
mirth of children the intellect ani more than a deep sens of humour
ha littl to do with the matter it is with both a gleam that plai
upon the surfac and impart a sunni and cheeri aspect alik to the
green branch and grei moulder trunk in on case howev it is
real sunshin in the other it more resembl the phosphoresc glow
of decai wood
it would be sad injustic the reader must understand to repres all
my excel old friend as in their dotag in the first place my
coadjutor were not invari old there were men among them in their
strength and prime of mark abil and energi and altogeth
superior to the sluggish and depend mode of life on which their evil
star had cast them then moreov the white lock of ag were
sometim found to be the thatch of an intellectu tenement in good
repair but as respect the major of my corp of veteran there
will be no wrong done if i character them gener as a set of
wearisom old soul who had gather noth worth preserv from
their vari experi of life thei seem to have flung awai all the
golden grain of practic wisdom which thei had enjoi so mani
opportun of harvest and most carefulli to have store their
memori with the husk thei spoke with far more interest and unction of
their morn breakfast or yesterdai todai or tomorrow
dinner than of the shipwreck of forti or fifti year ago and all the
world wonder which thei had wit with their youth ey
the father of the customhouseth patriarch not onli of thi littl
squad of offici but i am bold to sai of the respect bodi of
tidewait all over the unit stateswa a certain perman
inspector he might truli be term a legitim son of the revenu
system dy in the wool or rather born in the purpl sinc hi sire
a revolutionari colonel and formerli collector of the port had
creat an offic for him and appoint him to fill it at a period of
the earli ag which few live men can now rememb thi inspector
when i first knew him wa a man of fourscor year or thereabout
and certainli on of the most wonder specimen of wintergreen that
you would be like to discov in a lifetim search with hi florid
cheek hi compact figur smartli arrai in a brightbutton blue
coat hi brisk and vigor step and hi hale and hearti aspect
altogeth he seemednot young indeedbut a kind of new contriv of
mother natur in the shape of man whom ag and infirm had no
busi to touch hi voic and laugh which perpetu reecho
through the customhous had noth of the tremul quaver and
cackl of an old man utter thei came strut out of hi lung
like the crow of a cock or the blast of a clarion look at him
mere as an animaland there wa veri littl els to look ath wa a
most satisfactori object from the thorough health and
wholesom of hi system and hi capac at that extrem ag to
enjoi all or nearli all the delight which he had ever aim at or
conceiv of the careless secur of hi life in the customhous on
a regular incom and with but slight and infrequ apprehens of
remov had no doubt contribut to make time pass lightli over him
the origin and more potent caus howev lai in the rare
perfect of hi anim natur the moder proport of intellect
and the veri trifl admixtur of moral and spiritu ingredi
these latter qualiti inde be in bare enough measur to keep
the old gentleman from walk on allfour he possess no power of
thought no depth of feel no troublesom sensibl noth in
short but a few commonplac instinct which aid by the cheer
temper which grew inevit out of hi physic wellb did duti
veri respect and to gener accept in lieu of a heart he had
been the husband of three wive all long sinc dead the father of
twenti children most of whom at everi ag of childhood or matur
had likewis return to dust here on would suppos might have been
sorrow enough to imbu the sunniest disposit through and through
with a sabl ting not so with our old inspector on brief sigh
suffic to carri off the entir burden of these dismal reminisc
the next moment he wa as readi for sport as ani unbreech infant far
readier than the collector junior clerk who at nineteen year wa
much the elder and graver man of the two
i us to watch and studi thi patriarch personag with i think
liveli curios than ani other form of human there present to
my notic he wa in truth a rare phenomenon so perfect in on
point of view so shallow so delus so impalp such an absolut
nonent in everi other my conclus wa that he had no soul no
heart no mind noth as i have alreadi said but instinct and
yet withal so cunningli had the few materi of hi charact been
put togeth that there wa no pain percept of defici but
on my part an entir content with what i found in him it might be
difficultand it wa soto conceiv how he should exist hereaft so
earthli and sensuou did he seem but sure hi exist here
admit that it wa to termin with hi last breath had been not
unkindli given with no higher moral respons than the beast
of the field but with a larger scope of enjoy than their and
with all their bless immun from the dreari and duski of
ag
on point in which he had vastli the advantag over hi fourfoot
brethren wa hi abil to recollect the good dinner which it had
made no small portion of the happi of hi life to eat hi
gourmand wa a highli agreeabl trait and to hear him talk of roast
meat wa as appet as a pickl or an oyster as he possess no
higher attribut and neither sacrif nor vitiat ani spiritu
endow by devot all hi energi and ingenu to subserv the
delight and profit of hi maw it alwai pleas and satisfi me to
hear him expati on fish poultri and butcher meat and the most
elig method of prepar them for the tabl hi reminisc of
good cheer howev ancient the date of the actual banquet seem to
bring the savour of pig or turkei under on veri nostril there were
flavour on hi palat that had linger there not less than sixti or
seventi year and were still appar as fresh as that of the mutton
chop which he had just devour for hi breakfast i have heard him
smack hi lip over dinner everi guest at which except himself had
long been food for worm it wa marvel to observ how the ghost
of bygon meal were continu rise up befor himnot in anger or
retribut but as if grate for hi former appreci and
seek to redupl an endless seri of enjoy at onc shadowi
and sensual a tenderloin of beef a hindquart of veal a sparerib
of pork a particular chicken or a remark praiseworthi turkei
which had perhap adorn hi board in the dai of the elder adam
would be rememb while all the subsequ experi of our race
and all the event that brighten or darken hi individu career
had gone over him with as littl perman effect as the pass
breez the chief tragic event of the old man life so far as i could
judg wa hi mishap with a certain goos which live and di some
twenti or forti year ago a goos of most promis figur but which
at tabl prove so inveter tough that the carvingknif would
make no impress on it carcas and it could onli be divid with an
ax and handsaw
but it is time to quit thi sketch on which howev i should be glad
to dwell at consider more length becaus of all men whom i have
ever known thi individu wa fittest to be a customhous offic
most person ow to caus which i mai not have space to hint at
suffer moral detriment from thi peculiar mode of life the old
inspector wa incap of it and were he to continu in offic to
the end of time would be just as good as he wa then and sit down to
dinner with just as good an appetit
there is on like without which my galleri of customhous
portrait would be strang incomplet but which my compar few
opportun for observ enabl me to sketch onli in the merest
outlin it is that of the collector our gallant old gener who
after hi brilliant militari servic subsequ to which he had
rule over a wild western territori had come hither twenti year
befor to spend the declin of hi vari and honour life
the brave soldier had alreadi number nearli or quit hi
threescor year and ten and wa pursu the remaind of hi
earthli march burden with infirm which even the martial music
of hi own spiritstir recollect could do littl toward
lighten the step wa palsi now that had been foremost in the
charg it wa onli with the assist of a servant and by lean
hi hand heavili on the iron balustrad that he could slowli and
painfulli ascend the customhous step and with a toilsom progress

by a suspicion that on intellect is dwindl awai or exhal
without your conscious like ether out of a phial so that at

an effectwhich i believ to be observ more or less in everi

for hi live here or go to dig gold in california when he is so
soon to be made happi at monthli interv with a littl pile of

observ how slight a tast of offic suffic to infect a poor fellow
with thi singular diseas uncl sam goldmean no disrespect to

here wa a fine prospect in the distanc not that the surveyor brought
the lesson home to himself or admit that he could be so utterli
undon either by continu in offic or eject yet my
reflect were not the most comfort i began to grow melancholi
and restless continu pry into my mind to discov which of it
poor properti were gone and what degre of detriment had alreadi
accru to the remaind i endeavour to calcul how much longer i
could stai in the customhous and yet go forth a man to confess the
truth it wa my greatest apprehensiona it would never be a measur
of polici to turn out so quiet an individu as myself and it be
hardli in the natur of a public offic to resignit wa my chief
troubl therefor that i wa like to grow grei and decrepit in the
surveyorship and becom much such anoth anim as the old inspector
might it not in the tediou laps of offici life that lai befor me
final be with me as it wa with thi vener friendto make the
dinnerhour the nucleu of the dai and to spend the rest of it as an
old dog spend it asleep in the sunshin or in the shade a dreari
lookforward thi for a man who felt it to be the best definit of
happi to live throughout the whole rang of hi faculti and
sensibl but all thi while i wa give myself veri
unnecessari alarm provid had medit better thing for me than i
could possibl imagin for myself
a remark event of the third year of my surveyorshipto adopt the
tone of p pwa the elect of gener taylor to the presid
it is essenti in order to form a complet estim of the advantag
of offici life to view the incumb at the incom of a hostil
administr hi posit is then on of the most singularli
irksom and in everi conting disagre that a wretch
mortal can possibl occupi with seldom an altern of good on
either hand although what present itself to him as the worst event
mai veri probabl be the best but it is a strang experi to a man
of pride and sensibl to know that hi interest ar within the
control of individu who neither love nor understand him and by
whom sinc on or the other must need happen he would rather be
injur than oblig strang too for on who ha kept hi calm
throughout the contest to observ the bloodthirsti that is
develop in the hour of triumph and to be consciou that he is
himself among it object there ar few uglier trait of human natur
than thi tendencywhich i now wit in men no wors than their
neighboursto grow cruel mere becaus thei possess the power of
inflict harm if the guillotin as appli to officehold were
a liter fact instead of on of the most apt of metaphor it is my
sincer belief that the activ member of the victori parti were
suffici excit to have chop off all our head and have
thank heaven for the opportun it appear to mewho have been a
calm and curiou observ as well in victori as defeatthat thi
fierc and bitter spirit of malic and reveng ha never distinguish
the mani triumph of my own parti as it now did that of the whig the
democrat take the offic as a gener rule becaus thei need them
and becaus the practic of mani year ha made it the law of polit
warfar which unless a differ system be proclaim it wa weak
and cowardic to murmur at but the long habit of victori ha made them
gener thei know how to spare when thei see occas and when thei
strike the ax mai be sharp inde but it edg is seldom poison
with illwil nor is it their custom ignomini to kick the head
which thei have just struck off
in short unpleas as wa my predica at best i saw much reason
to congratul myself that i wa on the lose side rather than the
triumphant on if heretofor i had been none of the warmest of
partisan i began now at thi season of peril and advers to be
pretti acut sensibl with which parti my predilect lai nor wa
it without someth like regret and shame that accord to a
reason calcul of chanc i saw my own prospect of retain
offic to be better than those of my democrat brethren but who can
see an inch into futur beyond hi nose my own head wa the first
that fell
the moment when a man head drop off is seldom or never i am
inclin to think precis the most agreeabl of hi life
nevertheless like the greater part of our misfortun even so seriou
a conting bring it remedi and consol with it if the
suffer will but make the best rather than the worst of the accid
which ha befallen him in my particular case the consolatori topic
were close at hand and inde had suggest themselv to my
medit a consider time befor it wa requisit to us them in
view of my previou weari of offic and vagu thought of
resign my fortun somewhat resembl that of a person who should
entertain an idea of commit suicid and although beyond hi hope
meet with the good hap to be murder in the customhous as befor
in the old mans i had spent three yearsa term long enough to rest a
weari brain long enough to break off old intellectu habit and make
room for new on long enough and too long to have live in an
unnatur state do what wa realli of no advantag nor delight to
ani human be and withhold myself from toil that would at least
have still an unquiet impuls in me then moreov as regard hi
unceremoni eject the late surveyor wa not altogeth
illpleas to be recognis by the whig as an enemi sinc hi

crown of martyrdom though with no longer a head to wear it on the
point might be look upon as settl final littl heroic as he

a throng of beard men in sadcolour garment and grei
steeplecrown hat intermix with women some wear hood and

among their earliest practic necess to allot a portion of the
virgin soil as a cemeteri and anoth portion as the site of a prison
in accord with thi rule it mai safe be assum that the
forefath of boston had built the first prisonhous somewher in the
vicin of cornhil almost as season as thei mark out the first
burialground on isaac johnson lot and round about hi grave which
subsequ becam the nucleu of all the congreg sepulchr in

or twenti year after the settlement of the town the wooden jail wa
alreadi mark with weatherstain and other indic of ag which
gave a yet darker aspect to it beetlebrow and gloomi front the
rust on the ponder ironwork of it oaken door look more antiqu
than anyth els in the new world like all that pertain to crime
it seem never to have known a youth era befor thi ugli edific
and between it and the wheeltrack of the street wa a grassplot
much overgrown with burdock pigwe applepern and such unsightli
veget which evid found someth congeni in the soil that
had so earli born the black flower of civilis societi a prison but

thi rosebush by a strang chanc ha been kept aliv in histori

long after the fall of the gigant pine and oak that origin
overshadow it or whether as there is fair author for believ
it had sprung up under the footstep of the saint ann hutchinson as

the grassplot befor the jail in prison lane on a certain summer
morn not less than two centuri ago wa occupi by a pretti
larg number of the inhabit of boston all with their ey intent

or at a later period in the histori of new england the grim rigid

have augur some aw busi in hand it could have betoken
noth short of the anticip execut of some note culprit on
whom the sentenc of a legal tribun had but confirm the verdict of
public sentiment but in that earli sever of the puritan charact
an infer of thi kind could not so indubit be drawn it might
be that a sluggish bondserv or an unduti child whom hi
parent had given over to the civil author wa to be correct at
the whippingpost it might be that an antinomian a quaker or other
heterodox religionist wa to be scourg out of the town or an idl
or vagrant indian whom the white man firewat had made riotou
about the street wa to be driven with stripe into the shadow of the
forest it might be too that a witch like old mistress hibbin the
bittertemp widow of the magistr wa to die upon the gallow
in either case there wa veri much the same solemn of demeanour on
the part of the spectat as befit a peopl among whom religion
and law were almost ident and in whose charact both were so
thoroughli interfus that the mildest and severest act of public
disciplin were alik made vener and aw meagr inde and
cold wa the sympathi that a transgressor might look for from such
bystand at the scaffold on the other hand a penalti which in our
dai would infer a degre of mock infami and ridicul might then
be invest with almost as stern a digniti as the punish of death
itself
it wa a circumst to be note on the summer morn when our stori
begin it cours that the women of whom there were sever in the
crowd appear to take a peculiar interest in whatev penal
inflict might be expect to ensu the ag had not so much
refin that ani sens of improprieti restrain the wearer of
petticoat and farthingal from step forth into the public wai and
wedg their not unsubstanti person if occas were into the
throng nearest to the scaffold at an execut moral as well as
materi there wa a coarser fibr in those wive and maiden of old
english birth and breed than in their fair descend separ

chain of ancestri everi success mother had transmit to her child
a fainter bloom a more delic and briefer beauti and a slighter
physic frame if not charact of less forc and solid than her

less than half a centuri of the period when the manlik elizabeth had

shoulder and welldevelop bust and on round and ruddi cheek that
had ripen in the faroff island and had hardli yet grown paler or
thinner in the atmospher of new england there wa moreov a
bold and rotund of speech among these matron as most of them
seem to be that would startl us at the present dai whether in
respect to it purport or it volum of tone
goodwiv said a hardfeatur dame of fifti ill tell ye a piec
of my mind it would be greatli for the public behoof if we women
be of matur ag and churchmemb in good reput should have the
handl of such malefactress as thi hester prynn what think ye
gossip if the hussi stood up for judgment befor us five that ar
now here in a knot togeth would she come off with such a sentenc as
the worship magistr have award marri i trow not

should have come upon hi congreg
the magistr ar godfear gentlemen but merci overmuchthat

madam hester would have winc at that i warrant me but sheth
naughti baggagelittl will she care what thei put upon the bodic of
her gown why look you she mai cover it with a brooch or such like
heathenish adorn and so walk the street as brave as ever
ah but interpos more softli a young wife hold a child by

alwai in her heart
what do we talk of mark and brand whether on the bodic of her gown
or the flesh of her forehead cri anoth femal the ugliest as
well as the most pitiless of these selfconstitut judg thi woman
ha brought shame upon us all and ought to die is there not law for
it truli there is both in the scriptur and the statutebook then
let the magistr who have made it of no effect thank themselv if
their own wive and daughter go astrai
merci on us goodwif exclaim a man in the crowd is there no
virtu in woman save what spring from a wholesom fear of the
gallow that is the hardest word yet hush now gossip for the lock
is turn in the prisondoor and here come mistress prynn herself
the door of the jail be flung open from within there appear in
the first place like a black shadow emerg into sunshin the grim
and grisli presenc of the townbeadl with a sword by hi side and
hi staff of offic in hi hand thi personag prefigur and
repres in hi aspect the whole dismal sever of the puritan
code of law which it wa hi busi to administ in it final and
closest applic to the offend stretch forth the offici
staff in hi left hand he laid hi right upon the shoulder of a young
woman whom he thu drew forward until on the threshold of the
prisondoor she repel him by an action mark with natur digniti
and forc of charact and step into the open air as if by her own
free will she bore in her arm a child a babi of some three month
old who wink and turn asid it littl face from the too vivid
light of dai becaus it exist heretofor had brought it
acquaint onli with the grei twilight of a dungeon or other
darksom apart of the prison
when the young womanth mother of thi childstood fulli reveal
befor the crowd it seem to be her first impuls to clasp the infant
close to her bosom not so much by an impuls of motherli affect
as that she might therebi conceal a certain token which wa wrought or
fasten into her dress in a moment howev wise judg that on
token of her shame would but poorli serv to hide anoth she took the
babi on her arm and with a burn blush and yet a haughti smile and
a glanc that would not be abash look around at her townspeopl
and neighbour on the breast of her gown in fine red cloth
surround with an elabor embroideri and fantast flourish of
gold thread appear the letter a it wa so artist done and
with so much fertil and gorgeou luxuri of fanci that it had
all the effect of a last and fit decor to the apparel which
she wore and which wa of a splendour in accord with the tast of
the ag but greatli beyond what wa allow by the sumptuari
regul of the coloni
the young woman wa tall with a figur of perfect eleg on a larg
scale she had dark and abund hair so glossi that it threw off the
sunshin with a gleam and a face which besid be beauti from
regular of featur and rich of complexion had the
impress belong to a mark brow and deep black ey she wa
ladylik too after the manner of the feminin gentil of those
dai characteris by a certain state and digniti rather than by the
delic evanesc and indescrib grace which is now recognis
as it indic and never had hester prynn appear more ladylik
in the antiqu interpret of the term than as she issu from the
prison those who had befor known her and had expect to behold her
dim and obscur by a disastr cloud were astonish and even
startl to perceiv how her beauti shone out and made a halo of the
misfortun and ignomini in which she wa envelop it mai be true
that to a sensit observ there wa some thing exquisit pain
in it her attir which inde she had wrought for the occas in
prison and had model much after her own fanci seem to express
the attitud of her spirit the desper reckless of her mood by
it wild and picturesqu peculiar but the point which drew all
ey and as it were transfigur the wearerso that both men and
women who had been familiarli acquaint with hester prynn were now
impress as if thei beheld her for the first timewa that scarlet
letter so fantast embroid and illumin upon her bosom it
had the effect of a spell take her out of the ordinari relat
with human and enclos her in a sphere by herself
she hath good skill at her needl that certain remark on of
her femal spectat but did ever a woman befor thi brazen hussi
contriv such a wai of show it why gossip what is it but to
laugh in the face of our godli magistr and make a pride out of
what thei worthi gentlemen meant for a punish
it were well mutter the most ironvisag of the old dame if we
strip madam hester rich gown off her dainti shoulder and as for
the red letter which she hath stitch so curious ill bestow a rag
of mine own rheumat flannel to make a fitter on
oh peac neighbourspeac whisper their youngest companion do
not let her hear you not a stitch in that embroid letter but she
ha felt it in her heart
the grim beadl now made a gestur with hi staff make wai good
peoplemak wai in the king name cri he open a passag and i
promis ye mistress prynn shall be set where man woman and child
mai have a fair sight of her brave apparel from thi time till an hour
past meridian a bless on the righteou coloni of the massachusett
where iniqu is drag out into the sunshin come along madam
hester and show your scarlet letter in the marketplac
a lane wa forthwith open through the crowd of spectat preced
by the beadl and attend by an irregular process of sternbrow
men and unkindli visag women hester prynn set forth toward the
place appoint for her punish a crowd of eager and curiou
schoolboi understand littl of the matter in hand except that it
gave them a halfholidai ran befor her progress turn their head
continu to stare into her face and at the wink babi in her arm
and at the ignomini letter on her breast it wa no great distanc
in those dai from the prison door to the marketplac measur by
the prison experi howev it might be reckon a journei of
some length for haughti as her demeanour wa she perchanc underw
an agoni from everi footstep of those that throng to see her as if
her heart had been flung into the street for them all to spurn and
trampl upon in our natur howev there is a provis alik
marvel and merci that the suffer should never know the
intens of what he endur by it present tortur but chiefli by the
pang that rankl after it with almost a seren deport therefor
hester prynn pass through thi portion of her ordeal and came to a
sort of scaffold at the western extrem of the marketplac it
stood nearli beneath the eav of boston earliest church and
appear to be a fixtur there
in fact thi scaffold constitut a portion of a penal machin which
now for two or three gener past ha been mere histor and
traditionari among us but wa held in the old time to be as
effectu an agent in the promot of good citizenship as ever wa
the guillotin among the terrorist of franc it wa in short the
platform of the pillori and abov it rose the framework of that
instrument of disciplin so fashion as to confin the human head in
it tight grasp and thu hold it up to the public gaze the veri ideal
of ignomini wa embodi and made manifest in thi contriv of wood
and iron there can be no outrag methink against our common
naturewhatev be the delinqu of the individualno outrag more
flagrant than to forbid the culprit to hide hi face for shame as it
wa the essenc of thi punish to do in hester prynn instanc
howev as not unfrequ in other case her sentenc bore that she
should stand a certain time upon the platform but without undergo
that gripe about the neck and confin of the head the prone to
which wa the most devilish characterist of thi ugli engin know
well her part she ascend a flight of wooden step and wa thu
displai to the surround multitud at about the height of a man
shoulder abov the street
had there been a papist among the crowd of puritan he might have seen
in thi beauti woman so picturesqu in her attir and mien and
with the infant at her bosom an object to remind him of the imag of
divin matern which so mani illustri painter have vi with on
anoth to repres someth which should remind him inde but
onli by contrast of that sacr imag of sinless motherhood whose
infant wa to redeem the world here there wa the taint of deepest
sin in the most sacr qualiti of human life work such effect that
the world wa onli the darker for thi woman beauti and the more
lost for the infant that she had born
the scene wa not without a mixtur of aw such as must alwai invest
the spectacl of guilt and shame in a fellowcreatur befor societi
shall have grown corrupt enough to smile instead of shudder at it
the wit of hester prynn disgrac had not yet pass beyond
their simplic thei were stern enough to look upon her death had
that been the sentenc without a murmur at it sever but had none
of the heartless of anoth social state which would find onli a
theme for jest in an exhibit like the present even had there been a
disposit to turn the matter into ridicul it must have been
repress and overpow by the solemn presenc of men no less
dignifi than the governor and sever of hi counsellor a judg a
gener and the minist of the town all of whom sat or stood in a
balconi of the meetinghous look down upon the platform when such
personag could constitut a part of the spectacl without risk
the majesti or rever of rank and offic it wa safe to be
infer that the inflict of a legal sentenc would have an earnest
and effectu mean accordingli the crowd wa sombr and grave the
unhappi culprit sustain herself as best a woman might under the
heavi weight of a thousand unrel ey all fasten upon her and
concentr at her bosom it wa almost intoler to be born of an
impuls and passion natur she had fortifi herself to encount
the sting and venom stab of public contum wreak itself in
everi varieti of insult but there wa a qualiti so much more terribl
in the solemn mood of the popular mind that she long rather to
behold all those rigid counten contort with scorn merriment
and herself the object had a roar of laughter burst from the
multitudeeach man each woman each littl shrillvoic child
contribut their individu partshest prynn might have repaid
them all with a bitter and disdain smile but under the leaden
inflict which it wa her doom to endur she felt at moment as if
she must need shriek out with the full power of her lung and cast
herself from the scaffold down upon the ground or els go mad at onc
yet there were interv when the whole scene in which she wa the
most conspicu object seem to vanish from her ey or at least
glimmer indistinctli befor them like a mass of imperfectli shape
and spectral imag her mind and especi her memori wa

while thi pass hester prynn had been stand on her pedest
still with a fix gaze toward the strangerso fix a gaze that at
moment of intens absorpt all other object in the visibl world
seem to vanish leav onli him and her such an interview perhap
would have been more terribl than even to meet him as she now did
with the hot middai sun burn down upon her face and light up
it shame with the scarlet token of infami on her breast with the
sinborn infant in her arm with a whole peopl drawn forth as to a
festiv stare at the featur that should have been seen onli in
the quiet gleam of the firesid in the happi shadow of a home or

consciou of a shelter in the presenc of these thousand wit it
wa better to stand thu with so mani betwixt him and her than to
greet him face to facethei two alon she fled for refug as it were
to the public exposur and dread the moment when it protect
should be withdrawn from her involv in these thought she scarc
heard a voic behind her until it had repeat her name more than onc
in a loud and solemn tone audibl to the whole multitud
hearken unto me hester prynn said the voic
it ha alreadi been notic that directli over the platform on which
hester prynn stood wa a kind of balconi or open galleri append to
the meetinghous it wa the place whenc proclam were wont to
be made amidst an assemblag of the magistraci with all the
ceremoni that attend such public observ in those dai here
to wit the scene which we ar describ sat governor bellingham
himself with four sergeant about hi chair bear halberd as a
guard of honour he wore a dark feather in hi hat a border of
embroideri on hi cloak and a black velvet tunic beneatha gentleman
advanc in year with a hard experi written in hi wrinkl he
wa not illfit to be the head and repres of a commun
which ow it origin and progress and it present state of
develop not to the impuls of youth but to the stern and
temper energi of manhood and the sombr sagac of ag
accomplish so much precis becaus it imagin and hope so
littl the other emin charact by whom the chief ruler wa
surround were distinguish by a digniti of mien belong to a
period when the form of author were felt to possess the sacred
of divin institut thei were doubtless good men just and sage
but out of the whole human famili it would not have been easi to
select the same number of wise and virtuou person who should be less
capabl of sit in judgment on an er woman heart and
disentangl it mesh of good and evil than the sage of rigid aspect
toward whom hester prynn now turn her face she seem consciou
inde that whatev sympathi she might expect lai in the larger and
warmer heart of the multitud for as she lift her ey toward the
balconi the unhappi woman grew pale and trembl
the voic which had call her attent wa that of the reverend and
famou john wilson the eldest clergyman of boston a great scholar
like most of hi contemporari in the profess and withal a man of
kind and genial spirit thi last attribut howev had been less
carefulli develop than hi intellectu gift and wa in truth
rather a matter of shame than selfcongratul with him there he
stood with a border of grizzl lock beneath hi skullcap while hi
grei ey accustom to the shade light of hi studi were wink
like those of hester infant in the unadulter sunshin he look
like the darkli engrav portrait which we see prefix to old volum
of sermon and had no more right than on of those portrait would
have to step forth as he now did and meddl with a question of human
guilt passion and anguish
hester prynn said the clergyman i have striven with my young
brother here under whose preach of the word you have been
privileg to sither mr wilson laid hi hand on the shoulder of a
pale young man besid himi have sought i sai to persuad thi godli
youth that he should deal with you here in the face of heaven and
befor these wise and upright ruler and in hear of all the peopl
as touch the vile and black of your sin know your
natur temper better than i he could the better judg what argument
to us whether of tender or terror such as might prevail over
your hard and obstinaci insomuch that you should no longer hide
the name of him who tempt you to thi grievou fall but he oppos
to mewith a young man oversoft albeit wise beyond hi
yearsthat it were wrong the veri natur of woman to forc her to
lai open her heart secret in such broad daylight and in presenc of
so great a multitud truli as i sought to convinc him the shame lai
in the commiss of the sin and not in the show of it forth what
sai you to it onc again brother dimmesdal must it be thou or i
that shall deal with thi poor sinner soul
there wa a murmur among the dignifi and reverend occup of the
balconi and governor bellingham gave express to it purport
speak in an authorit voic although temper with respect
toward the youth clergyman whom he address
good master dimmesdal said he the respons of thi woman
soul li greatli with you it behov you therefor to exhort her to
repent and to confess as a proof and consequ thereof
the direct of thi appeal drew the ey of the whole crowd upon the
reverend mr dimmesdaleyoung clergyman who had come from on of the
great english univers bring all the learn of the ag into
our wild forest land hi eloqu and religi fervour had alreadi
given the earnest of high emin in hi profess he wa a person
of veri strike aspect with a white lofti and impend brow

permit he trod in the shadowi bypath and thu kept himself simpl
and childlik come forth when occas wa with a fresh and
fragranc and dewi puriti of thought which as mani peopl said
affect them like the speech of an angel
such wa the young man whom the reverend mr wilson and the governor
had introduc so openli to the public notic bid him speak in
the hear of all men to that mysteri of a woman soul so sacr
even in it pollut the try natur of hi posit drove the
blood from hi cheek and made hi lip tremul
speak to the woman my brother said mr wilson it is of moment to
her soul and therefor as the worship governor sai moment to
thine own in whose charg her is exhort her to confess the truth
the reverend mr dimmesdal bent hi head in silent prayer as it
seem and then came forward
hester prynn said he lean over the balconi and look down
steadfastli into her ey thou hearest what thi good man sai and
seest the account under which i labour if thou feelest it to be

made more effectu to salvat i charg thee to speak out the name

mistaken piti and tender for him for believ me hester though
he were to step down from a high place and stand there besid thee on

grant thee an open ignomini that therebi thou mayest work out an
open triumph over the evil within thee and the sorrow without take
heed how thou deniest to himwho perchanc hath not the courag to

the young pastor voic wa tremul sweet rich deep and broken
the feel that it so evid manifest rather than the direct
purport of the word caus it to vibrat within all heart and
brought the listen into on accord of sympathi even the poor babi
at hester bosom wa affect by the same influenc for it direct
it hitherto vacant gaze toward mr dimmesdal and held up it littl
arm with a halfpleas halfplaint murmur so power seem the
minist appeal that the peopl could not believ but that hester
prynn would speak out the guilti name or els that the guilti on
himself in whatev high or lowli place he stood would be drawn forth
by an inward and inevit necess and compel to ascend the
scaffold
hester shook her head
woman transgress not beyond the limit of heaven merci cri the
reverend mr wilson more harshli than befor that littl babe hath
been gift with a voic to second and confirm the counsel which thou
hast heard speak out the name that and thy repent mai avail to

she will not speak murmur mr dimmesdal who lean over the
balconi with hi hand upon hi heart had await the result of hi
appeal he now drew back with a long respir wondrou strength
and generos of a woman heart she will not speak
discern the impractic state of the poor culprit mind the
elder clergyman who had carefulli prepar himself for the occas
address to the multitud a discours on sin in all it branch but
with continu refer to the ignomini letter so forcibl did he
dwell upon thi symbol for the hour or more dure which hi period
were roll over the peopl head that it assum new terror in
their imagin and seem to deriv it scarlet hue from the flame
of the infern pit hester prynn meanwhil kept her place upon the
pedest of shame with glaze ey and an air of weari indiffer
she had born that morn all that natur could endur and as her
tempera wa not of the order that escap from too intens
suffer by a swoon her spirit could onli shelter itself beneath a

teach in respect to medicin herb and root that grew in the forest
to sai the truth there wa much need of profession assist not
mere for hester herself but still more urgent for the childwho
draw it susten from the matern bosom seem to have drank in
with it all the turmoil the anguish and despair which pervad the
mother system it now writh in convuls of pain and wa a
forcibl type in it littl frame of the moral agoni which hester
prynn had born throughout the dai
close follow the jailer into the dismal apart appear that
individu of singular aspect whose presenc in the crowd had been of
such deep interest to the wearer of the scarlet letter he wa lodg

the stranger had enter the room with the characterist quietud of
the profess to which he announc himself as belong nor did hi
demeanour chang when the withdraw of the prison keeper left him face
to face with the woman whose absorb notic of him in the crowd had
intim so close a relat between himself and her hi first care

smile live therefor and bear about thy doom with thee in the
ey of men and womenin the ey of him whom thou didst call thy
husbandin the ey of yonder child and that thou mayest live take

without further expostul or delai hester prynn drain the cup
and at the motion of the man of skill seat herself on the bed
where the child wa sleep while he drew the onli chair which the
room afford and took hi own seat besid her she could not but

mysteri thou mayest cover up thy secret from the pry multitud
thou mayest conceal it too from the minist and magistr even
as thou didst thi dai when thei sought to wrench the name out of thy

hester prynn term of confin wa now at an end her prisondoor
wa thrown open and she came forth into the sunshin which fall
on all alik seem to her sick and morbid heart as if meant for no
other purpos than to reveal the scarlet letter on her breast perhap
there wa a more real tortur in her first unattend footstep from
the threshold of the prison than even in the process and spectacl
that have been describ where she wa made the common infami at
which all mankind wa summon to point it finger then she wa
support by an unnatur tension of the nerv and by all the
comb energi of her charact which enabl her to convert the
scene into a kind of lurid triumph it wa moreov a separ and
insul event to occur but onc in her lifetim and to meet which
therefor reckless of economi she might call up the vital strength
that would have suffic for mani quiet year the veri law that
condemn hera giant of stern featur but with vigour to support as
well as to annihil in hi iron armhad held her up through the
terribl ordeal of her ignomini but now with thi unattend walk
from her prison door began the daili custom and she must either
sustain and carri it forward by the ordinari resourc of her natur
or sink beneath it she could no longer borrow from the futur to help
her through the present grief tomorrow would bring it own trial with

and yet the veri same that wa now so unutter grievou to be born
the dai of the faroff futur would toil onward still with the same
burden for her to take up and bear along with her but never to fling
down for the accumul dai and ad year would pile up their

the governor hall
hester prynn went on dai to the mansion of governor bellingham with
a pair of glove which she had fring and embroid to hi order
and which were to be worn on some great occas of state for though
the chanc of a popular elect had caus thi former ruler to
descend a step or two from the highest rank he still held an
honour and influenti place among the coloni magistraci
anoth and far more import reason than the deliveri of a pair of
embroid glove impel hester at thi time to seek an interview
with a personag of so much power and activ in the affair of the
settlement it had reach her ear that there wa a design on the part
of some of the lead inhabit cherish the more rigid order of
principl in religion and govern to depriv her of her child on
the supposit that pearl as alreadi hint wa of demon origin
these good peopl not unreason argu that a christian interest in
the mother soul requir them to remov such a stumblingblock from
her path if the child on the other hand were realli capabl of moral

then sure it would enjoi all the fairer prospect of these

hester prynn among those who promot the design governor
bellingham wa said to be on of the most busi it mai appear singular
and inde not a littl ludicr that an affair of thi kind which
in later dai would have been refer to no higher jurisdict than
that of the select men of the town should then have been a question
publicli discuss and on which statesmen of emin took side at
that epoch of pristin simplic howev matter of even slighter
public interest and of far less intrins weight than the welfar of

governor bellingham step through the window into the hall follow
by hi three guest
hester prynn said he fix hi natur stern regard on the

the old minist seat himself in an armchair and made an effort to
draw pearl betwixt hi knee but the child unaccustom to the touch
or familiar of ani but her mother escap through the open window
and stood on the upper step look like a wild tropic bird of rich
plumag readi to take flight into the upper air mr wilson not a

to proce with the examin
pearl said he with great solemn thou must take heed to
instruct that so in due season thou mayest wear in thy bosom the
pearl of great price canst thou tell me my child who made thee
now pearl knew well enough who made her for hester prynn the
daughter of a piou home veri soon after her talk with the child about
her heavenli father had begun to inform her of those truth which the
human spirit at whatev stage of immatur imbib with such eager
interest pearl thereforeso larg were the attain of her three
year lifetimecould have born a fair examin in the new england
primer or the first column of the westminst catech although
unacquaint with the outward form of either of those celebr work
but that pervers which all children have more or less of and of
which littl pearl had a tenfold portion now at the most inopportun
moment took thorough possess of her and close her lip or
impel her to speak word amiss after put her finger in her
mouth with mani ungraci refus to answer good mr wilson
question the child final announc that she had not been made at
all but had been pluck by her mother off the bush of wild rose that
grew by the prisondoor
thi phantasi wa probabl suggest by the near proxim of the
governor red rose as pearl stood outsid of the window togeth
with her recollect of the prison rosebush which she had pass in
come hither
old roger chillingworth with a smile on hi face whisper someth
in the young clergyman ear hester prynn look at the man of skill
and even then with her fate hang in the balanc wa startl to
perceiv what a chang had come over hi featureshow much uglier thei
were how hi dark complexion seem to have grown duskier and hi
figur more misshapensinc the dai when she had familiarli known him
she met hi ey for an instant but wa immedi constrain to
give all her attent to the scene now go forward
thi is aw cri the governor slowli recov from the
astonish into which pearl respons had thrown him here is a
child of three year old and she cannot tell who made her without
question she is equal in the dark as to her soul it present
deprav and futur destini methink gentlemen we need inquir no
further
hester caught hold of pearl and drew her forcibl into her arm
confront the old puritan magistr with almost a fierc express
alon in the world cast off by it and with thi sole treasur to keep
her heart aliv she felt that she possess indefeas right
against the world and wa readi to defend them to the death
god gave me the child cri she he gave her in requit of all
thing els which ye had taken from me she is my happinesssh is my
tortur none the less pearl keep me here in life pearl punish me
too see ye not she is the scarlet letter onli capabl of be
love and so endow with a millionfold the power of retribut for
my sin ye shall not take her i will die first
my poor woman said the not unkind old minist the child shall be
well care forfar better than thou canst do for it
god gave her into my keep repeat hester prynn rais her
voic almost to a shriek i will not give her up and here by a
sudden impuls she turn to the young clergyman mr dimmesdal at
whom up to thi moment she had seem hardli so much as onc to
direct her ey speak thou for me cri she thou wast my pastor
and hadst charg of my soul and knowest me better than these men can
i will not lose the child speak for me thou knowestfor thou hast
sympathi which these men lackthou knowest what is in my heart and
what ar a mother right and how much the stronger thei ar when
that mother ha but her child and the scarlet letter look thou to it
i will not lose the child look to it
at thi wild and singular appeal which indic that hester prynn
situat had provok her to littl less than mad the young
minist at onc came forward pale and hold hi hand over hi
heart as wa hi custom whenev hi peculiarli nervou tempera
wa thrown into agit he look now more careworn and emaci
than as we describ him at the scene of hester public ignomini and
whether it were hi fail health or whatev the caus might be hi
larg dark ey had a world of pain in their troubl and melancholi
depth
there is truth in what she sai began the minist with a voic
sweet tremul but power insomuch that the hall reecho and
the hollow armour rang with ittruth in what hester sai and in the
feel which inspir her god gave her the child and gave her too
an instinct knowledg of it natur and requirementsboth seemingli
so peculiarwhich no other mortal be can possess and moreov is
there not a qualiti of aw sacred in the relat between thi
mother and thi child
ayhow is that good master dimmesdal interrupt the governor
make that plain i prai you
it must be even so resum the minist for if we deem it
otherwis do we not therebi sai that the heavenli father the creator
of all flesh hath lightli recognis a deed of sin and made of no
account the distinct between unhallow lust and holi love thi
child of it father guilt and it mother shame ha come from the
hand of god to work in mani wai upon her heart who plead so
earnestli and with such bitter of spirit the right to keep her it
wa meant for a blessingfor the on bless of her life it wa
meant doubtless the mother herself hath told us for a retribut
too a tortur to be felt at mani an unthoughtof moment a pang a
sting an everrecur agoni in the midst of a troubl joi hath
she not express thi thought in the garb of the poor child so
forcibl remind us of that red symbol which sear her bosom
well said again cri good mr wilson i fear the woman had no
better thought than to make a mountebank of her child
oh not sonot so continu mr dimmesdal she recognis
believ me the solemn miracl which god hath wrought in the exist
of that child and mai she feel toowhat methink is the veri
truththat thi boon wa meant abov all thing els to keep the
mother soul aliv and to preserv her from blacker depth of sin
into which satan might els have sought to plung her therefor it is
good for thi poor sin woman that she hath an infant immort
a be capabl of etern joi or sorrow confid to her careto be
train up by her to righteous to remind her at everi moment of
her fall but yet to teach her as if it were by the creator sacr
pledg that if she bring the child to heaven the child also will
bring it parent thither herein is the sin mother happier than the
sin father for hester prynn sake then and no less for the poor
child sake let us leav them as provid hath seen fit to place
them
you speak my friend with a strang earnest said old roger
chillingworth smile at him
and there is a weighti import in what my young brother hath spoken
ad the rev mr wilson
what sai you worship master bellingham hath he not plead well
for the poor woman
inde hath he answer the magistr and hath adduc such
argument that we will even leav the matter as it now stand so
long at least as there shall be no further scandal in the woman care
must be had nevertheless to put the child to due and state
examin in the catech at thy hand or master dimmesdal
moreov at a proper season the tithingmen must take heed that she
go both to school and to meet
the young minist on ceas to speak had withdrawn a few step from
the group and stood with hi face partial conceal in the heavi
fold of the windowcurtain while the shadow of hi figur which the
sunlight cast upon the floor wa tremul with the vehem of hi
appeal pearl that wild and flighti littl elf stole softli toward
him and take hi hand in the grasp of both her own laid her cheek
against it a caress so tender and withal so unobtrus that her
mother who wa look on ask herselfi that my pearl yet she
knew that there wa love in the child heart although it mostli
reveal itself in passion and hardli twice in her lifetim had been
soften by such gentl as now the ministerfor save the
longsought regard of woman noth is sweeter than these mark of
childish prefer accord spontan by a spiritu instinct
and therefor seem to impli in us someth truli worthi to be
lovedth minist look round laid hi hand on the child head
hesit an instant and then kiss her brow littl pearl unwont
mood of sentiment last no longer she laugh and went caper down
the hall so airili that old mr wilson rais a question whether even
her tipto touch the floor
the littl baggag hath witchcraft in her i profess said he to mr
dimmesdal she need no old woman broomstick to fly withal
a strang child remark old roger chillingworth it is easi to see
the mother part in her would it be beyond a philosoph research
think ye gentlemen to analys that child natur and from it make
a mould to give a shrewd guess at the father
nai it would be sin in such a question to follow the clue of
profan philosophi said mr wilson better to fast and prai upon it
and still better it mai be to leav the mysteri as we find it unless
provid reveal it of it own accord therebi everi good christian
man hath a titl to show a father kind toward the poor desert
babe
the affair be so satisfactorili conclud hester prynn with
pearl depart from the hous as thei descend the step it is
aver that the lattic of a chamberwindow wa thrown open and forth
into the sunni dai wa thrust the face of mistress hibbin governor
bellingham bittertemp sister and the same who a few year
later wa execut as a witch

pearl had thei taken her from me i would willingli have gone with

in pursuanc of thi resolv he took up hi resid in the puritan
town as roger chillingworth without other introduct than the
learn and intellig of which he possess more than a common
measur as hi studi at a previou period of hi life had made him
extens acquaint with the medic scienc of the dai it wa as a
physician that he present himself and as such wa cordial receiv
skil men of the medic and chirurg profess were of rare
occurr in the coloni thei seldom it would appear partook of the
religi zeal that brought other emigr across the atlant in
their research into the human frame it mai be that the higher and
more subtl faculti of such men were materialis and that thei lost
the spiritu view of exist amid the intricaci of that wondrou
mechan which seem to involv art enough to compris all of life
within itself at all event the health of the good town of boston so
far as medicin had aught to do with it had hitherto lain in the
guardianship of an ag deacon and apothecari whose pieti and godli
deport were stronger testimoni in hi favour than ani that he
could have produc in the shape of a diploma the onli surgeon wa on
who combin the occasion exercis of that nobl art with the daili
and habitu flourish of a razor to such a profession bodi roger
chillingworth wa a brilliant acquisit he soon manifest hi
familiar with the ponder and impos machineri of antiqu
physic in which everi remedi contain a multitud of farfetch and
heterogen ingredi as elabor compound as if the propos
result had been the elixir of life in hi indian captiv moreov
he had gain much knowledg of the properti of nativ herb and
root nor did he conceal from hi patient that these simpl
medicin natur boon to the untutor savag had quit as larg a
share of hi own confid as the european pharmacopia which so
mani learn doctor had spent centuri in elabor
thi learn stranger wa exemplari as regard at least the outward
form of a religi life and earli after hi arriv had chosen for
hi spiritu guid the reverend mr dimmesdal the young divin
whose scholarlik renown still live in oxford wa consid by hi
more fervent admir as littl less than a heavenli ordain apostl
destin should he live and labour for the ordinari term of life to
do as great deed for the now feebl new england church as the earli
father had achiev for the infanc of the christian faith about thi
period howev the health of mr dimmesdal had evid begun to
fail by those best acquaint with hi habit the pale of the
young minist cheek wa account for by hi too earnest devot to
studi hi scrupul fulfil of parochi duti and more than all
to the fast and vigil of which he made a frequent practic in order
to keep the gross of thi earthli state from clog and obscur
hi spiritu lamp some declar that if mr dimmesdal were realli
go to die it wa caus enough that the world wa not worthi to be
ani longer trodden by hi feet he himself on the other hand with
characterist humil avow hi belief that if provid should
see fit to remov him it would be becaus of hi own unworthi to
perform it humblest mission here on earth with all thi differ of
opinion as to the caus of hi declin there could be no question of
the fact hi form grew emaci hi voic though still rich and
sweet had a certain melancholi propheci of decai in it he wa often
observ on ani slight alarm or other sudden accid to put hi hand
over hi heart with first a flush and then a pale indic of
pain
such wa the young clergyman condit and so immin the prospect
that hi dawn light would be extinguish all untim when roger
chillingworth made hi advent to the town hi first entri on the
scene few peopl could tell whenc drop down as it were out of
the sky or start from the nether earth had an aspect of mysteri
which wa easili heighten to the miracul he wa now known to be a
man of skill it wa observ that he gather herb and the blossom
of wildflow and dug up root and pluck off twig from the
foresttre like on acquaint with hidden virtu in what wa
valueless to common ey he wa heard to speak of sir kenelm digbi and
other famou menwhos scientif attain were esteem hardli less
than supernaturala have been hi correspond or associ why
with such rank in the learn world had he come hither what could
he whose sphere wa in great citi be seek in the wilder in
answer to thi queri a rumour gain groundand howev absurd wa
entertain by some veri sensibl peoplethat heaven had wrought an
absolut miracl by transport an emin doctor of physic from a
german univers bodili through the air and set him down at the
door of mr dimmesdal studi individu of wiser faith inde who
knew that heaven promot it purpos without aim at the
stageeffect of what is call miracul interposit were inclin
to see a providenti hand in roger chillingworth so opportun
arriv
thi idea wa countenanc by the strong interest which the physician
ever manifest in the young clergyman he attach himself to him as a
parishion and sought to win a friendli regard and confid from
hi natur reserv sensibl he express great alarm at hi
pastor state of health but wa anxiou to attempt the cure and if
earli undertaken seem not despond of a favour result the
elder the deacon the motherli dame and the young and fair maiden
of mr dimmesdal flock were alik importun that he should make
trial of the physician frankli offer skill mr dimmesdal gentli
repel their entreati
i need no medicin said he
but how could the young minist sai so when with everi success
sabbath hi cheek wa paler and thinner and hi voic more tremul
than beforewhen it had now becom a constant habit rather than a
casual gestur to press hi hand over hi heart wa he weari of hi
labour did he wish to die these question were solemnli propound
to mr dimmesdal by the elder minist of boston and the deacon of
hi church who to us their own phrase dealt with him on the sin
of reject the aid which provid so manifestli held out he
listen in silenc and final promis to confer with the physician
were it god will said the reverend mr dimmesdal when in
fulfil of thi pledg he request old roger chillingworth
profession advic i could be well content that my labour and my
sorrow and my sin and my pain should shortli end with me and
what is earthli of them be buri in my grave and the spiritu go
with me to my etern state rather than that you should put your skill
to the proof in my behalf
ah repli roger chillingworth with that quiet which whether
impos or natur mark all hi deport it is thu that a young
clergyman is apt to speak youth men not have taken a deep root
give up their hold of life so easili and saintli men who walk with
god on earth would fain be awai to walk with him on the golden
pavement of the new jerusalem
nai rejoin the young minist put hi hand to hi heart with
a flush of pain flit over hi brow were i worthier to walk there
i could be better content to toil here
good men ever interpret themselv too meanli said the physician
in thi manner the mysteri old roger chillingworth becam the
medic advis of the reverend mr dimmesdal as not onli the diseas
interest the physician but he wa strongli move to look into the
charact and qualiti of the patient these two men so differ in
ag came gradual to spend much time togeth for the sake of the
minist health and to enabl the leech to gather plant with
heal balm in them thei took long walk on the seashor or in the
forest mingl variou walk with the splash and murmur of the wave
and the solemn windanthem among the treetop often likewis on
wa the guest of the other in hi place of studi and retir there
wa a fascin for the minist in the compani of the man of
scienc in whom he recognis an intellectu cultiv of no
moder depth or scope togeth with a rang and freedom of idea
that he would have vainli look for among the member of hi own
profess in truth he wa startl if not shock to find thi
attribut in the physician mr dimmesdal wa a true priest a true
religionist with the reverenti sentiment larg develop and an
order of mind that impel itself powerfulli along the track of a
creed and wore it passag continu deeper with the laps of time
in no state of societi would he have been what is call a man of
liber view it would alwai be essenti to hi peac to feel the
pressur of a faith about him support while it confin him within
it iron framework not the less howev though with a tremul
enjoy did he feel the occasion relief of look at the univers
through the medium of anoth kind of intellect than those with which
he habitu held convers it wa as if a window were thrown open
admit a freer atmospher into the close and stifl studi where
hi life wa wast itself awai amid lamplight or obstruct
daybeam and the musti fragranc be it sensual or moral that
exhal from book but the air wa too fresh and chill to be long
breath with comfort so the minist and the physician with him
withdrew again within the limit of what their church defin as
orthodox
thu roger chillingworth scrutinis hi patient carefulli both as he
saw him in hi ordinari life keep an accustom pathwai in the
rang of thought familiar to him and as he appear when thrown
amidst other moral sceneri the novelti of which might call out
someth new to the surfac of hi charact he deem it essenti
it would seem to know the man befor attempt to do him good
wherev there is a heart and an intellect the diseas of the

recognis charact as a physicianthen at some inevit moment
will the soul of the suffer be dissolv and flow forth in a dark

roger chillingworth possess all or most of the attribut abov
enumer nevertheless time went on a kind of intimaci as we have
said grew up between these two cultiv mind which had as wide a
field as the whole sphere of human thought and studi to meet upon thei
discuss everi topic of ethic and religion of public affair and
privat charact thei talk much on both side of matter that
seem person to themselv and yet no secret such as the physician
fanci must exist there ever stole out of the minist
conscious into hi companion ear the latter had hi suspicion
inde that even the natur of mr dimmesdal bodili diseas had
never fairli been reveal to him it wa a strang reserv
after a time at a hint from roger chillingworth the friend of mr
dimmesdal effect an arrang by which the two were lodg in the

might pass under the ey of hi anxiou and attach physician there
wa much joi throughout the town when thi greatli desir object wa

authoris to do so he had select some on of the mani bloom

latter step howev there wa no present prospect that arthur
dimmesdal would be prevail upon to take he reject all suggest
of the kind as if priestli celibaci were on of hi articl of church

of which the protest divin even while thei vilifi and decri

and the reverend arthur dimmesdal best discern friend as we
have intim veri reason imagin that the hand of provid

but it must now be said anoth portion of the commun had latterli
begun to take it own view of the relat betwixt mr dimmesdal and
the mysteri old physician when an uninstruct multitud attempt
to see with it ey it is exceedingli apt to be deceiv when
howev it form it judgment as it usual doe on the intuit

profound and so uner as to possess the charact of truth
supernatur reveal the peopl in the case of which we speak
could justifi it prejudic against roger chillingworth by no fact or
argument worthi of seriou refut there wa an ag
handicraftsman it is true who had been a citizen of london at the
period of sir thoma overburi murder now some thirti year agon he
testifi to have seen the physician under some other name which
the narrat of the stori had now forgotten in compani with dr

medit scholarlik now there wa someth ugli and evil in hi
face which thei had not previous notic and which grew still the
more obviou to sight the often thei look upon him accord to
the vulgar idea the fire in hi laboratori had been brought from the
lower region and wa fed with infern fuel and so as might be
expect hi visag wa get sooti with the smoke
to sum up the matter it grew to be a wide diffus opinion that the
rev arthur dimmesdal like mani other personag of special sanctiti
in all ag of the christian world wa haunt either by satan himself
or satan emissari in the guis of old roger chillingworth thi
diabol agent had the divin permiss for a season to burrow
into the clergyman intimaci and plot against hi soul no sensibl
man it wa confess could doubt on which side the victori would
turn the peopl look with an unshaken hope to see the minist
come forth out of the conflict transfigur with the glori which he
would unquestion win meanwhil nevertheless it wa sad to think
of the perchanc mortal agoni through which he must struggl toward
hi triumph
ala to judg from the gloom and terror in the depth of the poor

the leech and hi patient
old roger chillingworth throughout life had been calm in tempera
kindli though not of warm affect but ever and in all hi
relat with the world a pure and upright man he had begun an
investig as he imagin with the sever and equal integr of a
judg desir onli of truth even as if the question involv no more

of human passion and wrong inflict on himself but as he
proceed a terribl fascin a kind of fierc though still calm
necess seiz the old man within it gripe and never set him free
again until he had done all it bid he now dug into the poor
clergyman heart like a miner search for gold or rather like a
sexton delv into a grave possibl in quest of a jewel that had been
buri on the dead man bosom but like to find noth save
mortal and corrupt ala for hi own soul if these were what he

sometim a light glimmer out of the physician ey burn blue

in other word mr dimmesdal whose sensibl of nerv often
produc the effect of spiritu intuit would becom vagu awar
that someth inim to hi peac had thrust itself into relat
with him but old roger chillingworth too had percept that were
almost intuit and when the minist threw hi startl ey toward
him there the physician sat hi kind watch sympathis but
never intrus friend
yet mr dimmesdal would perhap have seen thi individu charact
more perfectli if a certain morbid to which sick heart ar
liabl had not render him suspici of all mankind trust no man
as hi friend he could not recogn hi enemi when the latter
actual appear he therefor still kept up a familiar intercours
with him daili receiv the old physician in hi studi or visit
the laboratori and for recreat sake watch the process by
which weed were convert into drug of potenc
on dai lean hi forehead on hi hand and hi elbow on the sill of
the open window that look toward the graveyard he talk with
roger chillingworth while the old man wa examin a bundl of
unsightli plant
where ask he with a look askanc at themfor it wa the
clergyman peculiar that he seldom nowadai look straight
forth at ani object whether human or inanim where my kind
doctor did you gather those herb with such a dark flabbi leaf
even in the graveyard here at hand answer the physician
continu hi employ thei ar new to me i found them grow on
a grave which bore no tombston no other memori of the dead man
save these ugli weed that have taken upon themselv to keep him in
remembr thei grew out of hi heart and typifi it mai be some
hideou secret that wa buri with him and which he had done better
to confess dure hi lifetim
perchanc said mr dimmesdal he earnestli desir it but could
not
and wherefor rejoin the physician
wherefor not sinc all the power of natur call so earnestli for
the confess of sin that these black weed have sprung up out of a
buri heart to make manifest an outspoken crime
that good sir is but a phantasi of your repli the minist
there can be if i forbod aright no power short of the divin
merci to disclos whether by utter word or by type or emblem the
secret that mai be buri in the human heart the heart make itself
guilti of such secret must perforc hold them until the dai when all
hidden thing shall be reveal nor have i so read or interpret holi
writ as to understand that the disclosur of human thought and deed
then to be made is intend as a part of the retribut that
sure were a shallow view of it no these revel unless i
greatli err ar meant mere to promot the intellectu satisfact
of all intellig be who will stand wait on that dai to see
the dark problem of thi life made plain a knowledg of men heart
will be need to the completest solut of that problem and i
conceiv moreov that the heart hold such miser secret as
you speak of will yield them up at that last dai not with
reluct but with a joi unutter
then why not reveal it here ask roger chillingworth glanc
quietli asid at the minist why should not the guilti on sooner
avail themselv of thi unutter solac
thei mostli do said the clergyman gripe hard at hi breast as if
afflict with an importun throb of pain mani mani a poor soul
hath given it confid to me not onli on the deathb but while
strong in life and fair in reput and ever after such an
outpour oh what a relief have i wit in those sin
brethren even as in on who at last draw free air after a long
stifl with hi own pollut breath how can it be otherwis why
should a wretch manguilti we will sai of murderpref to keep the
dead corps buri in hi own heart rather than fling it forth at
onc and let the univers take care of it
yet some men buri their secret thu observ the calm physician
true there ar such men answer mr dimmesdal but not to
suggest more obviou reason it mai be that thei ar kept silent by
the veri constitut of their natur orcan we not suppos itguilti
as thei mai be retain nevertheless a zeal for god glori and
man welfar thei shrink from displai themselv black and filthi
in the view of men becaus thenceforward no good can be achiev by
them no evil of the past be redeem by better servic so to their
own unutter torment thei go about among their fellowcreatur
look pure as newfallen snow while their heart ar all speckl
and spot with iniqu of which thei cannot rid themselv
these men deceiv themselv said roger chillingworth with somewhat
more emphasi than usual and make a slight gestur with hi
forefing thei fear to take up the shame that rightfulli belong to
them their love for man their zeal for god servicethes holi
impuls mai or mai not coexist in their heart with the evil inmat
to which their guilt ha unbar the door and which must need
propag a hellish breed within them but if thei seek to glorifi
god let them not lift heavenward their unclean hand if thei would
serv their fellowmen let them do it by make manifest the power and
realiti of conscienc in constrain them to penitenti
selfabas would thou have me to believ o wise and piou friend
that a fals show can be bettercan be more for god glori or man
welfarethan god own truth trust me such men deceiv themselv
it mai be so said the young clergyman indiffer as waiv a
discuss that he consid irrelev or unseason he had a
readi faculti inde of escap from ani topic that agit hi too
sensit and nervou temperamentbut now i would ask of my
wellskil physician whether in good sooth he deem me to have
profit by hi kindli care of thi weak frame of mine
befor roger chillingworth could answer thei heard the clear wild
laughter of a young child voic proceed from the adjac
burialground look instinct from the open windowfor it wa
summertimeth minist beheld hester prynn and littl pearl pass
along the footpath that travers the enclosur pearl look as
beauti as the dai but wa in on of those mood of pervers
merriment which whenev thei occur seem to remov her entir
out of the sphere of sympathi or human contact she now skip
irrever from on grave to anoth until come to the broad
flat armori tombston of a depart worthyperhap of isaac johnson
himselfsh began to danc upon it in repli to her mother command
and entreati that she would behav more decor littl pearl paus
to gather the prickli burr from a tall burdock which grew besid the
tomb take a hand of these she arrang them along the line of
the scarlet letter that decor the matern bosom to which the
burr as their natur wa tenaci adher hester did not pluck
them off
roger chillingworth had by thi time approach the window and smile
grimli down
there is no law nor rever for author no regard for human
ordin or opinion right or wrong mix up with that child
composit remark he as much to himself as to hi companion i
saw her the other dai bespatt the governor himself with water at
the cattletrough in spring lane what in heaven name is she is
the imp altogeth evil hath she affect hath she ani discover
principl of be
none save the freedom of a broken law answer mr dimmesdal in a
quiet wai as if he had been discuss the point within himself
whether capabl of good i know not
the child probabl overheard their voic for look up to the
window with a bright but naughti smile of mirth and intellig she
threw on of the prickli burr at the rev mr dimmesdal the
sensit clergyman shrank with nervou dread from the light missil
detect hi emot pearl clap her littl hand in the most
extravag ecstaci hester prynn likewis had involuntarili look
up and all these four person old and young regard on anoth in
silenc till the child laugh aloud and shoutedcom awai mother
come awai or yonder old black man will catch you he hath got hold of
the minist alreadi come awai mother or he will catch you but he
cannot catch littl pearl
so she drew her mother awai skip danc and frisk
fantast among the hillock of the dead peopl like a creatur
that had noth in common with a bygon and buri gener nor
own herself akin to it it wa as if she had been made afresh out of
new element and must perforc be permit to live her own life and
be a law unto herself without her eccentr be reckon to her
for a crime
there goe a woman resum roger chillingworth after a paus who
be her demerit what thei mai hath none of that mysteri of hidden
sin which you deem so grievou to be born is hester prynn the
less miser think you for that scarlet letter on her breast
i do verili believ it answer the clergyman nevertheless i
cannot answer for her there wa a look of pain in her face which i
would gladli have been spare the sight of but still methink it
must need be better for the suffer to be free to show hi pain as
thi poor woman hester is than to cover it up in hi heart
there wa anoth paus and the physician began anew to examin and
arrang the plant which he had gather
you inquir of me a littl time agon said he at length my
judgment as touch your health
i did answer the clergyman and would gladli learn it speak
frankli i prai you be it for life or death
freeli then and plainli said the physician still busi with hi
plant but keep a wari ey on mr dimmesdal the disord is a
strang on not so much in itself nor as outwardli manifestedin so
far at least as the symptom have been laid open to my observ
look daili at you my good sir and watch the token of your
aspect now for month gone by i should deem you a man sore sick it
mai be yet not so sick but that an instruct and watch physician
might well hope to cure you but i know not what to sai the diseas is
what i seem to know yet know it not
you speak in riddl learn sir said the pale minist glanc
asid out of the window
then to speak more plainli continu the physician and i crave
pardon sir should it seem to requir pardon for thi need
plain of my speech let me ask as your friend as on have
charg under provid of your life and physic well be hath
all the oper of thi disord been fairli laid open and recount
to me
how can you question it ask the minist sure it were child
plai to call in a physician and then hide the sore
you would tell me then that i know all said roger chillingworth
deliber and fix an ey bright with intens and concentr
intellig on the minist face be it so but again he to whom
onli the outward and physic evil is laid open knoweth oftentim
but half the evil which he is call upon to cure a bodili diseas
which we look upon as whole and entir within itself mai after all
be but a symptom of some ailment in the spiritu part your pardon
onc again good sir if my speech give the shadow of offenc you
sir of all men whom i have known ar he whose bodi is the closest
conjoin and imbu and identifi so to speak with the spirit
whereof it is the instrument
then i need ask no further said the clergyman somewhat hastili
rise from hi chair you deal not i take it in medicin for the
soul
thu a sick continu roger chillingworth go on in an
unalt tone without heed the interrupt but stand up and
confront the emaci and whitecheek minist with hi low
dark and misshapen figurea sick a sore place if we mai so
call it in your spirit hath immedi it appropri manifest
in your bodili frame would you therefor that your physician heal
the bodili evil how mai thi be unless you first lai open to him the
wound or troubl in your soul
no not to thee not to an earthli physician cri mr dimmesdal
passion and turn hi ey full and bright and with a kind of
fierc on old roger chillingworth not to thee but if it be the
soul diseas then do i commit myself to the on physician of the
soul he if it stand with hi good pleasur can cure or he can kill
let him do with me as in hi justic and wisdom he shall see good
but who art thou that meddlest in thi matter that dare thrust
himself between the suffer and hi god
with a frantic gestur he rush out of the room
it is as well to have made thi step said roger chillingworth to
himself look after the minist with a grave smile there is
noth lost we shall be friend again anon but see now how passion
take hold upon thi man and hurrieth him out of himself as with on
passion so with anoth he hath done a wild thing er now thi piou
master dimmesdal in the hot passion of hi heart
it prove not difficult to reestablish the intimaci of the two
companion on the same foot and in the same degre as heretofor
the young clergyman after a few hour of privaci wa sensibl that
the disord of hi nerv had hurri him into an unseemli outbreak of
temper which there had been noth in the physician word to excus
or palliat he marvel inde at the violenc with which he had
thrust back the kind old man when mere proffer the advic which
it wa hi duti to bestow and which the minist himself had expressli
sought with these remors feel he lost no time in make the
amplest apolog and besought hi friend still to continu the care
which if not success in restor him to health had in all
probabl been the mean of prolong hi feebl exist to that
hour roger chillingworth readili assent and went on with hi
medic supervis of the minist do hi best for him in all
good faith but alwai quit the patient apart at the close
of the profession interview with a mysteri and puzzl smile upon
hi lip thi express wa invis in mr dimmesdal presenc
but grew strongli evid as the physician cross the threshold
a rare case he mutter i must need look deeper into it a
strang sympathi betwixt soul and bodi were it onli for the art
sake i must search thi matter to the bottom
it came to pass not long after the scene abov record that the
reverend mr dimmesdal at noondai and entir unawar fell into a
deep deep slumber sit in hi chair with a larg blacklett
volum open befor him on the tabl it must have been a work of vast
abil in the somnifer school of literatur the profound depth of
the minist repos wa the more remark inasmuch as he wa on
of those person whose sleep ordinarili is as light as fit and as
easili scare awai as a small bird hop on a twig to such an
unwont remot howev had hi spirit now withdrawn into itself
that he stir not in hi chair when old roger chillingworth without
ani extraordinari precaut came into the room the physician
advanc directli in front of hi patient laid hi hand upon hi
bosom and thrust asid the vestment that hitherto had alwai cover
it even from the profession ey
then inde mr dimmesdal shudder and slightli stir
after a brief paus the physician turn awai
but with what a wild look of wonder joi and horror with what a
ghastli raptur as it were too mighti to be express onli by the ey
and featur and therefor burst forth through the whole ugli
of hi figur and make itself even riotous manifest by the
extravag gestur with which he threw up hi arm toward the
ceil and stamp hi foot upon the floor had a man seen old roger
chillingworth at that moment of hi ecstasi he would have had no need
to ask how satan comport himself when a preciou human soul is lost to
heaven and won into hi kingdom
but what distinguish the physician ecstasi from satan wa the
trait of wonder in it
xi
the interior of a heart
after the incid last describ the intercours between the
clergyman and the physician though extern the same wa realli of
anoth charact than it had previous been the intellect of roger
chillingworth had now a suffici plain path befor it it wa not
inde precis that which he had laid out for himself to tread
calm gentl passionless as he appear there wa yet we fear a
quiet depth of malic hitherto latent but activ now in thi
unfortun old man which led him to imagin a more intim reveng
than ani mortal had ever wreak upon an enemi to make himself the on
trust friend to whom should be confid all the fear the remors
the agoni the ineffectu repent the backward rush of sin
thought expel in vain all that guilti sorrow hidden from the
world whose great heart would have piti and forgiven to be reveal
to him the pitilessto him the unforgiv all that dark treasur to
be lavish on the veri man to whom noth els could so adequ
pai the debt of vengeanc
the clergyman shy and sensit reserv had balk thi scheme roger
chillingworth howev wa inclin to be hardli if at all less
satisfi with the aspect of affair which providenceus the
aveng and hi victim for it own purpos and perchanc pardon
where it seem most to punishhad substitut for hi black devic a
revel he could almost sai had been grant to him it matter
littl for hi object whether celesti or from what other region by
it aid in all the subsequ relat betwixt him and mr
dimmesdal not mere the extern presenc but the veri inmost soul
of the latter seem to be brought out befor hi ey so that he
could see and comprehend it everi movement he becam thenceforth
not a spectat onli but a chief actor in the poor minist interior
world he could plai upon him as he chose would he arous him with a
throb of agoni the victim wa for ever on the rack it need onli to
know the spring that control the engin and the physician knew it
well would he startl him with sudden fear as at the wave of a
magician wand up rose a grisli phantomup rose a thousand
phantomsin mani shape of death or more aw shame all flock
round about the clergyman and point with their finger at hi
breast
all thi wa accomplish with a subtleti so perfect that the
minist though he had constantli a dim percept of some evil
influenc watch over him could never gain a knowledg of it actual
natur true he look doubtfulli fearfullyeven at time with
horror and the bitter of hatredat the deform figur of the old
physician hi gestur hi gait hi grizzl beard hi slightest
and most indiffer act the veri fashion of hi garment were
odiou in the clergyman sight a token implicitli to be reli on of
a deeper antipathi in the breast of the latter than he wa will to
acknowledg to himself for as it wa imposs to assign a reason
for such distrust and abhorr so mr dimmesdal consciou that the
poison of on morbid spot wa infect hi heart entir substanc
attribut all hi presenti to no other caus he took himself to
task for hi bad sympathi in refer to roger chillingworth
disregard the lesson that he should have drawn from them and did hi
best to root them out unabl to accomplish thi he nevertheless as a
matter of principl continu hi habit of social familiar with
the old man and thu gave him constant opportun for perfect
the purpos to whichpoor forlorn creatur that he wa and more
wretch than hi victimth aveng had devot himself
while thu suffer under bodili diseas and gnaw and tortur by
some black troubl of the soul and given over to the machin of
hi deadliest enemi the reverend mr dimmesdal had achiev a
brilliant popular in hi sacr offic he won it inde in great

thei ever dream of seekingto express the highest truth through the

afar and indistinctli from the upper height where thei habitu

not improb it wa to thi latter class of men that mr dimmesdal
by mani of hi trait of charact natur belong to the high
mountain peak of faith and sanctiti he would have climb had not the
tendenc been thwart by the burden whatev it might be of crime or
anguish beneath which it wa hi doom to totter it kept him down on a

the angel might els have listen to and answer but thi veri
burden it wa that gave him sympathi so intim with the sin
brotherhood of mankind so that hi heart vibrat in unison with
their and receiv their pain into itself and sent it own throb of
pain through a thousand other heart in gush of sad persuas
eloqu oftenest persuas but sometim terribl the peopl knew

their infirm believ that he would go heavenward befor them and
enjoin it upon their children that their old bone should be buri
close to their young pastor holi grave and all thi time perchanc
when poor mr dimmesdal wa think of hi grave he question with
himself whether the grass would ever grow on it becaus an accurs
thing must there be buri
it is inconceiv the agoni with which thi public vener
tortur him it wa hi genuin impuls to ador the truth and to
reckon all thing shadowlik and utterli devoid of weight or valu
that had not it divin essenc as the life within their life then
what wa hea substanceor the dimmest of all shadow he long to
speak out from hi own pulpit at the full height of hi voic and tell
the peopl what he wa i whom you behold in these black garment of

utterli a pollut and a lie
more than onc mr dimmesdal had gone into the pulpit with a purpos
never to come down it step until he should have spoken word like the
abov more than onc he had clear hi throat and drawn in the long
deep and tremul breath which when sent forth again would come
burden with the black secret of hi soul more than oncenai more
than a hundr timesh had actual spoken spoken but how he had
told hi hearer that he wa altogeth vile a viler companion of the
vilest the worst of sinner an abomin a thing of unimagin
iniqu and that the onli wonder wa that thei did not see hi
wretch bodi shrivel up befor their ey by the burn wrath of
the almighti could there be plainer speech than thi would not the
peopl start up in their seat by a simultan impuls and tear him
down out of the pulpit which he defil not so inde thei heard it
all and did but rever him the more thei littl guess what
deadli purport lurk in those selfcondemn word the godli
youth said thei among themselv the saint on earth ala if he
discern such sin in hi own white soul what horrid spectacl
would he behold in thine or mine the minist well knewsubtl but
remors hypocrit that he wasth light in which hi vagu
confess would be view he had striven to put a cheat upon himself
by make the avow of a guilti conscienc but had gain onli on
other sin and a selfacknowledg shame without the momentari relief
of be selfdeceiv he had spoken the veri truth and transform
it into the veriest falsehood and yet by the constitut of hi
natur he love the truth and loath the lie as few men ever did
therefor abov all thing els he loath hi miser self
hi inward troubl drove him to practic more in accord with the
old corrupt faith of rome than with the better light of the church
in which he had been born and bred in mr dimmesdal secret closet
under lock and kei there wa a bloodi scourg oftentim thi
protest and puritan divin had pli it on hi own shoulder
laugh bitterli at himself the while and smite so much the more
pitilessli becaus of that bitter laugh it wa hi custom too as it
ha been that of mani other piou puritan to fastnot howev like
them in order to purifi the bodi and render it the fitter medium of
celesti illuminationbut rigor and until hi knee trembl
beneath him as an act of penanc he kept vigil likewis night
after night sometim in utter dark sometim with a glimmer
lamp and sometim view hi own face in a lookingglass by the
most power light which he could throw upon it he thu typifi the
constant introspect wherewith he tortur but could not purifi
himself in these lengthen vigil hi brain often reel and
vision seem to flit befor him perhap seen doubtfulli and by a
faint light of their own in the remot dim of the chamber or more
vividli and close besid him within the lookingglass now it wa a
herd of diabol shape that grin and mock at the pale minist
and beckon him awai with them now a group of shine angel who
flew upward heavili as sorrowladen but grew more ether as thei
rose now came the dead friend of hi youth and hi whitebeard
father with a saintlik frown and hi mother turn her face awai
as she pass by ghost of a motherthinnest fantasi of a

son and now through the chamber which these spectral thought had
made so ghastli glide hester prynn lead along littl pearl in
her scarlet garb and point her forefing first at the scarlet
letter on her bosom and then at the clergyman own breast
none of these vision ever quit delud him at ani moment by an
effort of hi will he could discern substanc through their misti
lack of substanc and convinc himself that thei were not solid in
their natur like yonder tabl of carv oak or that big squar
leatherbound and brazenclasp volum of divin but for all that
thei were in on sens the truest and most substanti thing which
the poor minist now dealt with it is the unspeak miseri of a
life so fals as hi that it steal the pith and substanc out of
whatev realiti there ar around us and which were meant by heaven
to be the spirit joi and nutriment to the untru man the whole
univers is falseit is impalpableit shrink to noth within hi
grasp and he himself in so far as he show himself in a fals light
becom a shadow or inde ceas to exist the onli truth that
continu to give mr dimmesdal a real exist on thi earth wa the
anguish in hi inmost soul and the undissembl express of it in
hi aspect had he onc found power to smile and wear a face of
gaieti there would have been no such man
on on of those ugli night which we have faintli hint at but
forborn to pictur forth the minist start from hi chair a new
thought had struck him there might be a moment peac in it attir
himself with as much care as if it had been for public worship and
precis in the same manner he stole softli down the staircas undid
the door and issu forth

the minist vigil
walk in the shadow of a dream as it were and perhap actual
under the influenc of a speci of somnambul mr dimmesdal
reach the spot where now so long sinc hester prynn had live
through her first hour of public ignomini the same platform or
scaffold black and weatherstain with the storm or sunshin of seven
long year and footworn too with the tread of mani culprit who had

discern no face abov the platform nor hardli the outlin of a human
shape in the dark grei of the midnight but the town wa all asleep
there wa no peril of discoveri the minist might stand there if it
so pleas him until morn should redden in the east without other
risk than that the dank and chill night air would creep into hi frame
and stiffen hi joint with rheumat and clog hi throat with
catarrh and cough therebi defraud the expect audienc of
tomorrow prayer and sermon no ey could see him save that
everwak on which had seen him in hi closet wield the bloodi
scourg why then had he come hither wa it but the mockeri of
penit a mockeri inde but in which hi soul trifl with
itself a mockeri at which angel blush and wept while fiend
rejoic with jeer laughter he had been driven hither by the
impuls of that remors which dog him everywher and whose own
sister and close link companion wa that cowardic which invari
drew him back with her tremul gripe just when the other impuls
had hurri him to the verg of a disclosur poor miser man what
right had infirm like hi to burden itself with crime crime is for
the ironnerv who have their choic either to endur it or if it
press too hard to exert their fierc and savag strength for a good
purpos and fling it off at onc thi feebl and most sensit of
spirit could do neither yet continu did on thing or anoth
which intertwin in the same inextric knot the agoni of
heavendefi guilt and vain repent
and thu while stand on the scaffold in thi vain show of
expiat mr dimmesdal wa overcom with a great horror of mind as
if the univers were gaze at a scarlet token on hi nake breast
right over hi heart on that spot in veri truth there wa and there
had long been the gnaw and poison tooth of bodili pain without
ani effort of hi will or power to restrain himself he shriek
aloud an outcri that went peal through the night and wa beaten
back from on hous to anoth and reverber from the hill in the
background as if a compani of devil detect so much miseri and
terror in it had made a playth of the sound and were bandi it
to and fro
it is done mutter the minist cover hi face with hi hand
the whole town will awak and hurri forth and find me here
but it wa not so the shriek had perhap sound with a far greater
power to hi own startl ear than it actual possess the town
did not awak or if it did the drowsi slumber mistook the cry
either for someth fright in a dream or for the nois of witch
whose voic at that period were often heard to pass over the
settlement or lone cottag as thei rode with satan through the

uncov hi ey and look about him at on of the chamberwindow
of governor bellingham mansion which stood at some distanc on the
line of anoth street he beheld the appear of the old magistr

long white gown envelop hi figur he look like a ghost evok
unseason from the grave the cry had evid startl him at
anoth window of the same hous moreov appear old mistress
hibbin the governor sister also with a lamp which even thu far
off reveal the express of her sour and discont face she
thrust forth her head from the lattic and look anxious upward
beyond the shadow of a doubt thi vener witchladi had heard mr

magistr after a wari observ of the darknessinto which
nevertheless he could see but littl further than he might into a
millstoneretir from the window
the minist grew compar calm hi ey howev were soon
greet by a littl glimmer light which at first a long wai off
wa approach up the street it threw a gleam of recognit on here
a post and there a garden fenc and here a lattic windowpan and
there a pump with it full trough of water and here again an arch
door of oak with an iron knocker and a rough log for the doorstep
the reverend mr dimmesdal note all these minut particular even
while firmli convinc that the doom of hi exist wa steal
onward in the footstep which he now heard and that the gleam of the
lantern would fall upon him in a few moment more and reveal hi
longhidden secret as the light drew nearer he beheld within it
illumin circl hi brother clergymanor to speak more accur
hi profession father as well as highli valu friendth reverend
mr wilson who as mr dimmesdal now conjectur had been prai at
the bedsid of some dy man and so he had the good old minist

pass from earth to heaven within that veri hour and now surround
like the saintlik personag of olden time with a radiant halo that
glorifi him amid thi gloomi night of sina if the depart governor
had left him an inherit of hi glori or as if he had caught upon
himself the distant shine of the celesti citi while look
thitherward to see the triumphant pilgrim pass within it gatesnow in
short good father wilson wa move homeward aid hi footstep
with a light lantern the glimmer of thi luminari suggest the
abov conceit to mr dimmesdal who smilednai almost laugh at

as the reverend mr wilson pass besid the scaffold close muffl
hi geneva cloak about him with on arm and hold the lantern befor
hi breast with the other the minist could hardli restrain himself
from speak
a good even to you vener father wilson come up hither i prai

good heaven had mr dimmesdal actual spoken for on instant he
believ that these word had pass hi lip but thei were utter
onli within hi imagin the vener father wilson continu to
step slowli onward look carefulli at the muddi pathwai befor hi
feet and never onc turn hi head toward the guilti platform when
the light of the glimmer lantern had fade quit awai the minist
discov by the faint which came over him that the last few
moment had been a crisi of terribl anxieti although hi mind had
made an involuntari effort to reliev itself by a kind of lurid
play
shortli afterward the like grisli sens of the humor again stole
in among the solemn phantom of hi thought he felt hi limb grow
stiff with the unaccustom chilli of the night and doubt
whether he should be abl to descend the step of the scaffold morn
would break and find him there the neighbourhood would begin to rous
itself the earliest riser come forth in the dim twilight would
perceiv a vaguelydefin figur aloft on the place of shame and

reverend arthur dimmesdal halffrozen to death overwhelm with
shame and stand where hester prynn had stood
carri awai by the grotesqu horror of thi pictur the minist
unawar and to hi own infinit alarm burst into a great peal of
laughter it wa immedi respond to by a light airi childish
laugh in which with a thrill of the heartbut he knew not whether of
exquisit pain or pleasur as acuteh recognis the tone of littl
pearl
pearl littl pearl cri he after a moment paus then
suppress hi voicehest hester prynn ar you there

she silent ascend the step and stood on the platform hold
littl pearl by the hand the minist felt for the child other hand
and took it the moment that he did so there came what seem a
tumultu rush of new life other life than hi own pour like a
torrent into hi heart and hurri through all hi vein as if the
mother and the child were commun their vital warmth to hi

minist whisper littl pearl
what wouldst thou sai child ask mr dimmesdal
wilt thou stand here with mother and me tomorrow noontid inquir
pearl
nai not so my littl pearl answer the minist for with the
new energi of the moment all the dread of public exposur that had so
long been the anguish of hi life had return upon him and he wa
alreadi trembl at the conjunct in whichwith a strang joi
neverthelessh now found himselfnot so my child i shall inde
stand with thy mother and thee on other dai but not tomorrow
pearl laugh and attempt to pull awai her hand but the minist
held it fast
a moment longer my child said he
but wilt thou promis ask pearl to take my hand and mother

not then pearl said the minist but anoth time
and what other time persist the child
at the great judgment dai whisper the minist and strang
enough the sens that he wa a profession teacher of the truth
impel him to answer the child so then and there befor the
judgmentseat thy mother and thou and i must stand togeth but the
daylight of thi world shall not see our meet
pearl laugh again
but befor mr dimmesdal had done speak a light gleam far and
wide over all the muffl sky it wa doubtless caus by on of those
meteor which the nightwatch mai so often observ burn out to
wast in the vacant region of the atmospher so power wa it
radianc that it thoroughli illumin the dens medium of cloud
betwixt the sky and earth the great vault brighten like the dome of

littl worn and even in the marketplac margin with green on either
sideal were visibl but with a singular of aspect that seem to
give anoth moral interpret to the thing of thi world than thei
had ever born befor and there stood the minist with hi hand over
hi heart and hester prynn with the embroid letter glimmer on
her bosom and littl pearl herself a symbol and the connect link
between those two thei stood in the noon of that strang and solemn
splendour as if it were the light that is to reveal all secret and
the daybreak that shall unit all who belong to on anoth
there wa witchcraft in littl pearl ey and her face as she
glanc upward at the minist wore that naughti smile which made it
express frequent so elvish she withdrew her hand from mr
dimmesdal and point across the street but he clasp both hi
hand over hi breast and cast hi ey toward the zenith
noth wa more common in those dai than to interpret all meteor

regular than the rise and set of sun and moon as so mani

of a highli disord mental state when a man render morbidli
selfcontempl by long intens and secret pain had extend hi
egot over the whole expans of natur until the firmament itself
should appear no more than a fit page for hi soul histori and

we imput it therefor sole to the diseas in hi own ey and heart
that the minist look upward to the zenith beheld there the
appear of an immens letterth letter amark out in line of
dull red light not but the meteor mai have shown itself at that point
burn duskili through a veil of cloud but with no such shape as hi
guilti imagin gave it or at least with so littl definit
that anoth guilt might have seen anoth symbol in it
there wa a singular circumst that characteris mr dimmesdal
psycholog state at thi moment all the time that he gaze upward
to the zenith he wa nevertheless perfectli awar that littl pearl
wa point her finger toward old roger chillingworth who stood at
no great distanc from the scaffold the minist appear to see him
with the same glanc that discern the miracul letter to hi
featur as to all other object the meteor light impart a new
express or it might well be that the physician wa not care
then as at all other time to hide the malevol with which he
look upon hi victim certainli if the meteor kindl up the sky
and disclos the earth with an aw that admonish hester
prynn and the clergyman of the dai of judgment then might roger
chillingworth have pass with them for the archfiend stand there

anoth view of hester
in her late singular interview with mr dimmesdal hester prynn wa
shock at the condit to which she found the clergyman reduc hi
nerv seem absolut destroi hi moral forc wa abas into more
than childish weak it grovel helpless on the ground even while
hi intellectu faculti retain their pristin strength or had
perhap acquir a morbid energi which diseas onli could have given
them with her knowledg of a train of circumst hidden from all
other she could readili infer that besid the legitim action of
hi own conscienc a terribl machineri had been brought to bear and
wa still oper on mr dimmesdal wellb and repos know
what thi poor fallen man had onc been her whole soul wa move by
the shudder terror with which he had appeal to herth outcast
womanfor support against hi instinct discov enemi she
decid moreov that he had a right to her utmost aid littl
accustom in her long seclus from societi to measur her idea of
right and wrong by ani standard extern to herself hester sawor
seem to seethat there lai a respons upon her in refer to
the clergyman which she own to no other nor to the whole world
besid the link that unit her to the rest of humankindlink of
flower or silk or gold or whatev the materialhad all been
broken here wa the iron link of mutual crime which neither he nor
she could break like all other ti it brought along with it it

case when a person stand out in ani promin befor the commun

interest and conveni a speci of gener regard had ultim

love more readili than it hate hatr by a gradual and quiet
process will even be transform to love unless the chang be imped
by a continu new irrit of the origin feel of hostil
in thi matter of hester prynn there wa neither irrit nor

which she had been set apart to infami wa reckon larg in her
favour with noth now to lose in the sight of mankind and with no

genuin regard for virtu that had brought back the poor wander to

it wa perceiv too that while hester never put forward even the
humblest titl to share in the world privilegesfurth than to

acknowledg her sisterhood with the race of man whenev benefit were

thi might be pride but wa so like humil that it produc all the

the ruler and the wise and learn men of the commun were longer

fortifi in themselv by an iron framework of reason that made

more thei had begun to look upon the scarlet letter as the token not
of that on sin for which she had born so long and dreari a penanc
but of her mani good deed sinc do you see that woman with the
embroid badg thei would sai to stranger it is our hesterth

so comfort to the afflict then it is true the propens of
human natur to tell the veri worst of itself when embodi in the

the veri men who spoke thu the scarlet letter had the effect of the

mani that an indian had drawn hi arrow against the badg and that
the missil struck it and fell harmless to the ground
the effect of the symbolor rather of the posit in respect to

fallen awai leav a bare and harsh outlin which might have been
repuls had she possess friend or companion to be repel by it
even the attract of her person had undergon a similar chang
it might be partli ow to the studi auster of her dress and
partli to the lack of demonstr in her manner it wa a sad
transform too that her rich and luxuri hair had either been
cut off or wa so complet hidden by a cap that not a shine lock
of it ever onc gush into the sunshin it wa due in part to all
these caus but still more to someth els that there seem to be
no longer anyth in hester face for love to dwell upon noth in
hester form though majest and statuelik that passion would ever
dream of clasp in it embrac noth in hester bosom to make it
ever again the pillow of affect some attribut had depart from

such is frequent the fate and such the stern develop of the
feminin charact and person when the woman ha encount and
live through an experi of peculiar sever if she be all
tender she will die if she surviv the tender will either be
crush out of her orand the outward semblanc is the samecrush so

magic touch to effect the transform we shall see whether hester
prynn were ever afterward so touch and so transfigur
much of the marbl cold of hester impress wa to be attribut
to the circumst that her life had turn in a great measur from

it is remark that person who specul the most boldli often

littl pearl never come to her from the spiritu world it might have

the scarlet letter had not done it offic now howev her interview
with the reverend mr dimmesdal on the night of hi vigil had given
her a new theme of reflect and held up to her an object that
appear worthi of ani exert and sacrific for it attain she
had wit the intens miseri beneath which the minist struggl
or to speak more accur had ceas to struggl she saw that he
stood on the verg of lunaci if he had not alreadi step across it
it wa imposs to doubt that whatev pain efficaci there might

and had avail himself of the opportun thu afford for

could not but ask herself whether there had not origin been a
defect of truth courag and loyalti on her own part in allow the
minist to be thrown into a posit where so much evil wa to be
forebod and noth auspici to be hope her onli justif
lai in the fact that she had been abl to discern no method of rescu
him from a blacker ruin than had overwhelm herself except by
acquiesc in roger chillingworth scheme of disguis under that
impuls she had made her choic and had chosen as it now appear
the more wretch altern of the two she determin to redeem her
error so far as it might yet be possibl strengthen by year of hard
and solemn trial she felt herself no longer so inadequ to cope with
roger chillingworth as on that night abas by sin and halfmadden
by the ignomini that wa still new when thei had talk togeth in
the prisonchamb she had climb her wai sinc then to a higher
point the old man on the other hand had brought himself nearer to
her level or perhap below it by the reveng which he had stoop
for
in fine hester prynn resolv to meet her former husband and do what
might be in her power for the rescu of the victim on whom he had so
evid set hi gripe the occas wa not long to seek on
afternoon walk with pearl in a retir part of the peninsula she
beheld the old physician with a basket on on arm and a staff in the

hester and the physician
hester bade littl pearl run down to the margin of the water and plai
with the shell and tangl seawe until she should have talk
awhil with yonder gather of herb so the child flew awai like a
bird and make bare her small white feet went patter along the
moist margin of the sea here and there she came to a full stop and
peep curious into a pool left by the retir tide as a mirror for
pearl to see her face in forth peep at her out of the pool with
dark glisten curl around her head and an elfsmil in her ey
the imag of a littl maid whom pearl have no other playmat
invit to take her hand and run a race with her but the visionari
littl maid on her part beckon likewis as if to saythi is a
better place come thou into the pool and pearl step in midleg
deep beheld her own white feet at the bottom while out of a still
lower depth came the gleam of a kind of fragmentari smile float to
and fro in the agit water
meanwhil her mother had accost the physician i would speak a word
with you said shea word that concern us much
aha and is it mistress hester that ha a word for old roger
chillingworth answer he rais himself from hi stoop postur
with all my heart why mistress i hear good tide of you on all

man wa discours of your affair mistress hester and whisper me
that there had been question concern you in the council it wa
debat whether or no with safeti to the commonw yonder scarlet
letter might be taken off your bosom on my life hester i made my
intreati to the worship magistr that it might be done forthwith
it li not in the pleasur of the magistr to take off the badg
calmli repli hester were i worthi to be quit of it it would fall

speak a differ purport
nai then wear it if it suit you better rejoin he a woman must
need follow her own fanci touch the adorn of her person the
letter is gaili embroid and show right brave on your bosom
all thi while hester had been look steadili at the old man and wa
shock as well as wondersmitten to discern what a chang had been
wrought upon him within the past seven year it wa not so much that
he had grown older for though the trace of advanc life were
visibl he bore hi ag well and seem to retain a wiri vigour and
alert but the former aspect of an intellectu and studiou man
calm and quiet which wa what she best rememb in him had
altogeth vanish and been succeed by an eager search almost
fierc yet carefulli guard look it seem to be hi wish and
purpos to mask thi express with a smile but the latter plai him
fals and flicker over hi visag so deris that the spectat
could see hi black all the better for it ever and anon too
there came a glare of red light out of hi ey as if the old man
soul were on fire and kept on smoulder duskili within hi breast
until by some casual puff of passion it wa blown into a momentari
flame thi he repress as speedili as possibl and strove to look as
if noth of the kind had happen
in a word old roger chillingworth wa a strike evid of man
faculti of transform himself into a devil if he will onli for a
reason space of time undertak a devil offic thi unhappi
person had effect such a transform by devot himself for seven
year to the constant analysi of a heart full of tortur and deriv
hi enjoy thenc and ad fuel to those fieri tortur which he
analys and gloat over
the scarlet letter burn on hester prynn bosom here wa anoth
ruin the respons of which came partli home to her
what see you in my face ask the physician that you look at it so
earnestli
someth that would make me weep if there were ani tear bitter
enough for it answer she but let it pass it is of yonder
miser man that i would speak
and what of him cri roger chillingworth eagerli as if he love
the topic and were glad of an opportun to discuss it with the onli
person of whom he could make a confid not to hide the truth
mistress hester my thought happen just now to be busi with the
gentleman so speak freeli and i will make answer
when we last spake togeth said hester now seven year ago it
wa your pleasur to extort a promis of secreci as touch the former
relat betwixt yourself and me as the life and good fame of yonder
man were in your hand there seem no choic to me save to be silent
in accord with your behest yet it wa not without heavi misgiv
that i thu bound myself for have cast off all duti toward other
human be there remain a duti toward him and someth
whisper me that i wa betrai it in pledg myself to keep your
counsel sinc that dai no man is so near to him as you you tread
behind hi everi footstep you ar besid him sleep and wake you

on hi life and you caus him to die daili a live death and still
he know you not in permit thi i have sure act a fals part
by the onli man to whom the power wa left me to be true
what choic had you ask roger chillingworth my finger point
at thi man would have hurl him from hi pulpit into a dungeon
thenc peradventur to the gallow
it had been better so said hester prynn
what evil have i done the man ask roger chillingworth again i
tell thee hester prynn the richest fee that ever physician earn
from monarch could not have bought such care as i have wast on thi
miser priest but for my aid hi life would have burn awai in
torment within the first two year after the perpetr of hi crime
and thine for hester hi spirit lack the strength that could have
born up as thine ha beneath a burden like thy scarlet letter oh i
could reveal a goodli secret but enough what art can do i have
exhaust on him that he now breath and creep about on earth is
ow all to me
better he had di at onc said hester prynn
yea woman thou sayest truli cri old roger chillingworth let
the lurid fire of hi heart blaze out befor her ey better had he
di at onc never did mortal suffer what thi man ha suffer and
all all in the sight of hi worst enemi he ha been consciou of me
he ha felt an influenc dwell alwai upon him like a curs he

so sensit as thish knew that no friendli hand wa pull at hi

sought onli evil and found it but he knew not that the ey and hand
were mine with the superstit common to hi brotherhood he fanci
himself given over to a fiend to be tortur with fright dream and
desper thought the sting of remors and despair of pardon as a
foretast of what await him beyond the grave but it wa the constant
shadow of my presenc the closest propinqu of the man whom he had
most vile wrong and who had grown to exist onli by thi perpetu
poison of the direst reveng yea inde he did not err there wa a
fiend at hi elbow a mortal man with onc a human heart ha becom a
fiend for hi especi torment
the unfortun physician while utter these word lift hi hand
with a look of horror as if he had beheld some fright shape which
he could not recognis usurp the place of hi own imag in a glass
it wa on of those momentswhich sometim occur onli at the interv

if that ha not aveng me i can do no more
he laid hi finger on it with a smile

i judg no less said the physician and now what wouldst thou with
me touch thi man
i must reveal the secret answer hester firmli he must discern
thee in thy true charact what mai be the result i know not but thi
long debt of confid due from me to him whose bane and ruin i have

woman i could wellnigh piti thee said roger chillingworth unabl
to restrain a thrill of admir too for there wa a qualiti almost
majest in the despair which she express thou hadst great

hester and pearl
so roger chillingwortha deform old figur with a face that haunt
men memori longer than thei likedtook leav of hester prynn and
went stoop awai along the earth he gather here and there a herb
or grub up a root and put it into the basket on hi arm hi grai
beard almost touch the ground as he crept onward hester gaze after
him a littl while look with a half fantast curios to see
whether the tender grass of earli spring would not be blight beneath
him and show the waver track of hi footstep sere and brown
across it cheer verdur she wonder what sort of herb thei were
which the old man wa so sedul to gather would not the earth
quicken to an evil purpos by the sympathi of hi ey greet him with
poison shrub of speci hitherto unknown that would start up under
hi finger or might it suffic him that everi wholesom growth should
be convert into someth deleteri and malign at hi touch did
the sun which shone so brightli everywher els realli fall upon him
or wa there as it rather seem a circl of omin shadow move
along with hi deform whichev wai he turn himself and whither
wa he now go would he not suddenli sink into the earth leav a
barren and blast spot where in due cours of time would be seen
deadli nightshad dogwood henban and whatev els of veget
wicked the climat could produc all flourish with hideou
luxuri or would he spread bat wing and flee awai look so
much the uglier the higher he rose toward heaven
be it sin or no said hester prynn bitterli as still she gaze
after him i hate the man
she upbraid herself for the sentiment but could not overcom or
lessen it attempt to do so she thought of those longpast dai in
a distant land when he us to emerg at eventid from the seclus
of hi studi and sit down in the firelight of their home and in the
light of her nuptial smile he need to bask himself in that smile he
said in order that the chill of so mani lone hour among hi book
might be taken off the scholar heart such scene had onc appear
not otherwis than happi but now as view through the dismal medium
of her subsequ life thei class themselv among her ugliest
remembr she marvel how such scene could have been she
marvel how she could ever have been wrought upon to marri him she
deem it her crime most to be repent of that she had ever endur
and reciproc the lukewarm grasp of hi hand and had suffer the
smile of her lip and ey to mingl and melt into hi own and it
seem a fouler offenc commit by roger chillingworth than ani which
had sinc been done him that in the time when her heart knew no
better he had persuad her to fanci herself happi by hi side
ye i hate him repeat hester more bitterli than befor he
betrai me he ha done me wors wrong than i did him
let men trembl to win the hand of woman unless thei win along with it
the utmost passion of her heart els it mai be their miser
fortun as it wa roger chillingworth when some mightier touch than
their own mai have awaken all her sensibl to be reproach
even for the calm content the marbl imag of happi which thei
will have impos upon her as the warm realiti but hester ought long
ago to have done with thi injustic what did it betoken had seven
long year under the tortur of the scarlet letter inflict so much
of miseri and wrought out no repent
the emot of that brief space while she stood gaze after the
crook figur of old roger chillingworth threw a dark light on

littl boat out of birchbark and freight them with snailshel
and sent out more ventur on the mighti deep than ani merchant in new
england but the larger part of them founder near the shore she
seiz a live horsesho by the tail and made prize of sever
fivefing and laid out a jellyfish to melt in the warm sun then
she took up the white foam that streak the line of the advanc
tide and threw it upon the breez scamper after it with wing
footstep to catch the great snowflak er thei fell perceiv a
flock of beachbird that fed and flutter along the shore the
naughti child pick up her apron full of pebbl and creep from
rock to rock after these small seafowl displai remark dexter
in pelt them on littl grai bird with a white breast pearl wa
almost sure had been hit by a pebbl and flutter awai with a broken
wing but then the elfchild sigh and gave up her sport becaus it
griev her to have done harm to a littl be that wa as wild as the
seabreez or as wild as pearl herself
her final employ wa to gather seawe of variou kind and make
herself a scarf or mantl and a headdress and thu assum the aspect
of a littl mermaid she inherit her mother gift for devis
draperi and costum as the last touch to her mermaid garb pearl
took some eelgrass and imit as best she could on her own bosom
the decor with which she wa so familiar on her mother a
letterth letter abut freshli green instead of scarlet the child
bent her chin upon her breast and contempl thi devic with
strang interest even as if the on onli thing for which she had been
sent into the world wa to make out it hidden import
i wonder if mother will ask me what it mean thought pearl
just then she heard her mother voic and flit along as lightli
as on of the littl seabird appear befor hester prynn danc
laugh and point her finger to the ornament upon her bosom
my littl pearl said hester after a moment silenc the green
letter and on thy childish bosom ha no purport but dost thou know
my child what thi letter mean which thy mother is doom to wear
ye mother said the child it is the great letter a thou hast
taught me in the hornbook
hester look steadili into her littl face but though there wa that
singular express which she had so often remark in her black ey
she could not satisfi herself whether pearl realli attach ani mean
to the symbol she felt a morbid desir to ascertain the point
dost thou know child wherefor thy mother wear thi letter
truli do i answer pearl look brightli into her mother face
it is for the same reason that the minist keep hi hand over hi
heart
and what reason is that ask hester half smile at the absurd
incongru of the child observ but on second thought turn
pale
what ha the letter to do with ani heart save mine
nai mother i have told all i know said pearl more serious than
she wa wont to speak ask yonder old man whom thou hast been talk
withit mai be he can tell but in good earnest now mother dear what
doe thi scarlet letter meanand why dost thou wear it on thy
bosomand why doe the minist keep hi hand over hi heart
she took her mother hand in both her own and gaze into her ey
with an earnest that wa seldom seen in her wild and caprici
charact the thought occur to hester that the child might realli
be seek to approach her with childlik confid and do what
she could and as intellig as she knew how to establish a
meetingpoint of sympathi it show pearl in an unwont aspect
heretofor the mother while love her child with the intens of a
sole affect had school herself to hope for littl other return
than the wayward of an april breez which spend it time in airi
sport and ha it gust of inexplic passion and is petul in
it best of mood and chill often than caress you when you take
it to your bosom in requit of which misdemeanour it will sometim
of it own vagu purpos kiss your cheek with a kind of doubt
tender and plai gentli with your hair and then be gone about it
other idl busi leav a dreami pleasur at your heart and thi
moreov wa a mother estim of the child disposit ani other
observ might have seen few but unami trait and have given them
a far darker colour but now the idea came strongli into hester
mind that pearl with her remark precoc and acut might
alreadi have approach the ag when she could have been made a friend
and intrust with as much of her mother sorrow as could be
impart without irrever either to the parent or the child in the
littl chao of pearl charact there might be seen emerg and
could have been from the veri firstth steadfast principl of an
unflinch couragean uncontrol willsturdi pride which might be
disciplin into selfrespectand a bitter scorn of mani thing which
when examin might be found to have the taint of falsehood in them
she possess affect too though hitherto acrid and disagre
as ar the richest flavour of unrip fruit with all these sterl
attribut thought hester the evil which she inherit from her
mother must be great inde if a nobl woman do not grow out of thi
elfish child
pearl inevit tendenc to hover about the enigma of the scarlet
letter seem an innat qualiti of her be from the earliest epoch
of her consciou life she had enter upon thi as her appoint
mission hester had often fanci that provid had a design of
justic and retribut in endow the child with thi mark
propens but never until now had she bethought herself to ask
whether link with that design there might not likewis be a purpos
of merci and benefic if littl pearl were entertain with faith
and trust as a spirit messeng no less than an earthli child might
it not be her errand to sooth awai the sorrow that lai cold in her
mother heart and convert it into a tomband to help her to
overcom the passion onc so wild and even yet neither dead nor
asleep but onli imprison within the same tomblik heart
such were some of the thought that now stir in hester mind with
as much vivac of impress as if thei had actual been whisper
into her ear and there wa littl pearl all thi while hold her
mother hand in both her own and turn her face upward while she
put these search question onc and again and still a third time
what doe the letter mean mother and why dost thou wear it and why
doe the minist keep hi hand over hi heart
what shall i sai thought hester to herself no if thi be the
price of the child sympathi i cannot pai it
then she spoke aloud
silli pearl said she what question ar these there ar mani
thing in thi world that a child must not ask about what know i of
the minist heart and as for the scarlet letter i wear it for the
sake of it gold thread
in all the seven bygon year hester prynn had never befor been
fals to the symbol on her bosom it mai be that it wa the talisman of
a stern and sever but yet a guardian spirit who now forsook her as
recognis that in spite of hi strict watch over her heart some new
evil had crept into it or some old on had never been expel as for
littl pearl the earnest soon pass out of her face
but the child did not see fit to let the matter drop two or three
time as her mother and she went homeward and as often at
suppertim and while hester wa put her to bed and onc after
she seem to be fairli asleep pearl look up with mischief gleam
in her black ey
mother said she what doe the scarlet letter mean
and the next morn the first indic the child gave of be
awak wa by pop up her head from the pillow and make that other
enquiri which she had so unaccount connect with her
investig about the scarlet letter
mothermotherwhi doe the minist keep hi hand over hi heart
hold thy tongu naughti child answer her mother with an asper
that she had never permit to herself befor do not teas me els
i shall put thee into the dark closet

inde nor peril to the holi white of the clergyman good fame
had she visit him in hi own studi where mani a penit er now
had confess sin of perhap as deep a dye as the on betoken by the
scarlet letter but partli that she dread the secret or undisguis
interfer of old roger chillingworth and partli that her consciou
heart impart suspicion where none could have been felt and partli
that both the minist and she would need the whole wide world to
breath in while thei talk togetherfor all these reason hester
never thought of meet him in ani narrow privaci than beneath the
open sky
at last while attend a sick chamber whither the rev mr
dimmesdal had been summon to make a prayer she learnt that he had
gone the dai befor to visit the apostl eliot among hi indian
convert he would probabl return by a certain hour in the afternoon
of the morrow betim therefor the next dai hester took littl
pearlwho wa necessarili the companion of all her mother
expedit howev inconveni her presenceand set forth
the road after the two wayfar had cross from the peninsula to the
mainland wa no other than a footpath it straggl onward into the
mysteri of the primev forest thi hem it in so narrowli and
stood so black and dens on either side and disclos such imperfect
glimps of the sky abov that to hester mind it imag not amiss
the moral wilder in which she had so long been wander the dai
wa chill and sombr overhead wa a grai expans of cloud slightli
stir howev by a breez so that a gleam of flicker sunshin
might now and then be seen at it solitari plai along the path thi
flit cheer wa alwai at the further extrem of some long
vista through the forest the sportiv sunlightfeebl sportiv at
best in the predomin pensiv of the dai and scenewithdrew
itself as thei came nigh and left the spot where it had danc the
drearier becaus thei had hope to find them bright
mother said littl pearl the sunshin doe not love you it run

now see there it is plai a good wai off stand you here and let
me run and catch it i am but a child it will not flee from mefor i

and why not mother ask pearl stop short just at the
begin of her race will not it come of it own accord when i am a
woman grown
run awai child answer her mother and catch the sunshin it

pearl set forth at a great pace and as hester smile to perceiv did
actual catch the sunshin and stood laugh in the midst of it all
brighten by it splendour and scintil with the vivac
excit by rapid motion the light linger about the lone child as
if glad of such a playmat until her mother had drawn almost nigh
enough to step into the magic circl too
it will go now said pearl shake her head
see answer hester smile now i can stretch out my hand and
grasp some of it
as she attempt to do so the sunshin vanish or to judg from the
bright express that wa danc on pearl featur her mother
could have fanci that the child had absorb it into herself and
would give it forth again with a gleam about her path as thei should
plung into some gloomier shade there wa no other attribut that so
much impress her with a sens of new and untransmit vigour in
pearl natur as thi never fail vivac of spirit she had not
the diseas of sad which almost all children in these latter
dai inherit with the scrofula from the troubl of their ancestor
perhap thi too wa a diseas and but the reflex of the wild energi
with which hester had fought against her sorrow befor pearl birth
it wa certainli a doubt charm impart a hard metal lustr to
the child charact she wantedwhat some peopl want throughout
lifea grief that should deepli touch her and thu humanis and make
her capabl of sympathi but there wa time enough yet for littl

and who told you thi stori pearl ask her mother recognis a
common superstit of the period
it wa the old dame in the chimnei corner at the hous where you

she wa talk of it she said that a thousand and a thousand peopl
had met him here and had written in hi book and have hi mark on
them and that ugli temper ladi old mistress hibbin wa on and
mother the old dame said that thi scarlet letter wa the black man

ye if thou tellest me all answer pearl
onc in my life i met the black man said her mother thi scarlet
letter is hi mark
thu convers thei enter suffici deep into the wood to secur
themselv from the observ of ani casual passeng along the
forest track here thei sat down on a luxuri heap of moss which at
some epoch of the preced centuri had been a gigant pine with it
root and trunk in the darksom shade and it head aloft in the upper
atmospher it wa a littl dell where thei had seat themselv with
a leafstrewn bank rise gentli on either side and a brook flow
through the midst over a bed of fallen and drown leav the tree
impend over it had flung down great branch from time to time
which choke up the current and compel it to form eddi and black
depth at some point while in it swifter and liveli passag
there appear a channelwai of pebbl and brown sparkl sand
let the ey follow along the cours of the stream thei could
catch the reflect light from it water at some short distanc within
the forest but soon lost all trace of it amid the bewilder of
treetrunk and underbrush and here and there a huge rock cover over
with grai lichen all these giant tree and boulder of granit seem
intent on make a mysteri of the cours of thi small brook fear
perhap that with it neverceas loquac it should whisper
tale out of the heart of the old forest whenc it flow or mirror
it revel on the smooth surfac of a pool continu inde
as it stole onward the streamlet kept up a babbl kind quiet
sooth but melancholi like the voic of a young child that wa
spend it infanc without play and knew not how to be merri
among sad acquaint and event of sombr hue
oh brook oh foolish and tiresom littl brook cri pearl after
listen awhil to it talk why art thou so sad pluck up a spirit
and do not be all the time sigh and murmur
but the brook in the cours of it littl lifetim among the forest
tree had gone through so solemn an experi that it could not help
talk about it and seem to have noth els to sai pearl
resembl the brook inasmuch as the current of her life gush from a
wellspr as mysteri and had flow through scene shadow as
heavili with gloom but unlik the littl stream she danc and
sparkl and prattl airili along her cours
what doe thi sad littl brook sai mother inquir she
if thou hadst a sorrow of thine own the brook might tell thee of it
answer her mother even as it is tell me of mine but now pearl
i hear a footstep along the path and the nois of on put asid
the branch i would have thee betak thyself to plai and leav me to
speak with him that come yonder
is it the black man ask pearl
wilt thou go and plai child repeat her mother but do not strai
far into the wood and take heed that thou come at my first call
ye mother answer pearl but if it be the black man wilt thou
not let me stai a moment and look at him with hi big book under hi
arm
go silli child said her mother impati it is no black man
thou canst see him now through the tree it is the minist
and so it is said the child and mother he ha hi hand over hi
heart is it becaus when the minist wrote hi name in the book the
black man set hi mark in that place but why doe he not wear it
outsid hi bosom as thou dost mother
go now child and thou shalt teas me as thou wilt anoth time
cri hester prynn but do not strai far keep where thou canst hear
the babbl of the brook
the child went sing awai follow up the current of the brook and
strive to mingl a more lightsom cadenc with it melancholi voic
but the littl stream would not be comfort and still kept tell
it unintellig secret of some veri mourn mysteri that had
happenedor make a prophet lament about someth that wa yet
to happenwithin the verg of the dismal forest so pearl who had
enough of shadow in her own littl life chose to break off all
acquaint with thi repin brook she set herself therefor to
gather violet and woodanemon and some scarlet columbin that
she found grow in the crevic of a high rock
when her elfchild had depart hester prynn made a step or two
toward the track that led through the forest but still remain under
the deep shadow of the tree she beheld the minist advanc along
the path entir alon and lean on a staff which he had cut by the
waysid he look haggard and feebl and betrai a nerveless
despond in hi air which had never so remark characteris him
in hi walk about the settlement nor in ani other situat where he
deem himself liabl to notic here it wa wofulli visibl in thi
intens seclus of the forest which of itself would have been a
heavi trial to the spirit there wa a listless in hi gait as if
he saw no reason for take on step further nor felt ani desir to do
so but would have been glad could he be glad of anyth to fling
himself down at the root of the nearest tree and lie there passiv for
evermor the leav might bestrew him and the soil gradual
accumul and form a littl hillock over hi frame no matter whether
there were life in it or no death wa too definit an object to be
wish for or avoid
to hester ey the reverend mr dimmesdal exhibit no symptom of

hoarselyarthur dimmesdal
who speak answer the minist gather himself quickli up he
stood more erect like a man taken by surpris in a mood to which he
wa reluct to have wit throw hi ey anxious in the
direct of the voic he indistinctli beheld a form under the tree
clad in garment so sombr and so littl reliev from the grai
twilight into which the cloud sky and the heavi foliag had darken
the noontid that he knew not whether it were a woman or a shadow it
mai be that hi pathwai through life wa haunt thu by a spectr that

he made a step nigher and discov the scarlet letter
hester hester prynn said he is it thou art thou in life
even so she answer in such life as ha been mine these seven
year past and thou arthur dimmesdal dost thou yet live
it wa no wonder that thei thu question on anoth actual and
bodili exist and even doubt of their own so strang did thei
meet in the dim wood that it wa like the first encount in the world
beyond the grave of two spirit who had been intim connect in
their former life but now stood coldli shudder in mutual dread as
not yet familiar with their state nor wont to the companionship of
disembodi be each a ghost and awestricken at the other ghost
thei were awestricken likewis at themselv becaus the crisi flung
back to them their conscious and reveal to each heart it
histori and experi as life never doe except at such breathless
epoch the soul beheld it featur in the mirror of the pass
moment it wa with fear and tremul and as it were by a slow
reluct necess that arthur dimmesdal put forth hi hand chill
as death and touch the chill hand of hester prynn the grasp cold
as it wa took awai what wa dreariest in the interview thei now felt
themselv at least inhabit of the same sphere
without a word more spokenneith he nor she assum the guidanc
but with an unexpress consentthei glide back into the shadow of the
wood whenc hester had emerg and sat down on the heap of moss where
she and pearl had befor been sit when thei found voic to speak
it wa at first onli to utter remark and inquiri such as ani two
acquaint might have made about the gloomi sky the threaten
storm and next the health of each thu thei went onward not
boldli but step by step into the theme that were brood deepest in
their heart so long estrang by fate and circumst thei need
someth slight and casual to run befor and throw open the door of
intercours so that their real thought might be led across the

hester prynn wa now fulli sensibl of the deep injuri for which she

left the minist to bear what she might pictur to herself as a more

the sacrific of the clergyman good name and death itself as she

a flood of sunshin
arthur dimmesdal gaze into hester face with a look in which hope
and joi shone out inde but with fear betwixt them and a kind of
horror at her bold who had spoken what he vagu hint at but
dare not speak
but hester prynn with a mind of nativ courag and activ and for
so long a period not mere estrang but outlaw from societi had
habitu herself to such latitud of specul as wa altogeth
foreign to the clergyman she had wander without rule or guidanc
in a moral wilder as vast as intric and shadowi as the
untam forest amid the gloom of which thei were now hold a
colloqui that wa to decid their fate her intellect and heart had
their home as it were in desert place where she roam as freeli as
the wild indian in hi wood for year past she had look from thi
estrang point of view at human institut and whatev priest or
legisl had establish criticis all with hardli more rever
than the indian would feel for the cleric band the judici robe
the pillori the gallow the firesid or the church the tendenc of
her fate and fortun had been to set her free the scarlet letter wa
her passport into region where other women dare not tread shame
despair solitud these had been her teachersstern and wild onesand
thei had made her strong but taught her much amiss
the minist on the other hand had never gone through an experi
calcul to lead him beyond the scope of gener receiv law
although in a singl instanc he had so fearfulli transgress on of
the most sacr of them but thi had been a sin of passion not of
principl nor even purpos sinc that wretch epoch he had watch
with morbid zeal and minut not hi actsfor those it wa easi to
arrangebut each breath of emot and hi everi thought at the head
of the social system as the clergymen of that dai stood he wa onli
the more trammel by it regul it principl and even it
prejudic as a priest the framework of hi order inevit hem
him in as a man who had onc sin but who kept hi conscienc all
aliv and painfulli sensit by the fret of an unheal wound he
might have been suppos safer within the line of virtu than if he had
never sin at all
thu we seem to see that as regard hester prynn the whole seven
year of outlaw and ignomini had been littl other than a prepar
for thi veri hour but arthur dimmesdal were such a man onc more to
fall what plea could be urg in extenu of hi crime none
unless it avail him somewhat that he wa broken down by long and
exquisit suffer that hi mind wa darken and confus by the
veri remors which harrow it that between flee as an avow
crimin and remain as a hypocrit conscienc might find it hard
to strike the balanc that it wa human to avoid the peril of death
and infami and the inscrut machin of an enemi that
final to thi poor pilgrim on hi dreari and desert path faint
sick miser there appear a glimps of human affect and
sympathi a new life and a true on in exchang for the heavi doom
which he wa now expiat and be the stern and sad truth spoken that
the breach which guilt ha onc made into the human soul is never in
thi mortal state repair it mai be watch and guard so that the
enemi shall not forc hi wai again into the citadel and might even in
hi subsequ assault select some other avenu in prefer to
that where he had formerli succeed but there is still the ruin
wall and near it the stealthi tread of the foe that would win over
again hi unforgotten triumph
the struggl if there were on need not be describ let it suffic
that the clergyman resolv to flee and not alon
if in all these past seven year thought he i could recal on
instant of peac or hope i would yet endur for the sake of that
earnest of heaven merci but nowsinc i am irrevoc
doomedwherefor should i not snatch the solac allow to the
condemn culprit befor hi execut or if thi be the path to a
better life as hester would persuad me i sure give up no fairer
prospect by pursu it neither can i ani longer live without her
companionship so power is she to sustainso tender to sooth o
thou to whom i dare not lift mine ey wilt thou yet pardon me
thou wilt go said hester calmli as he met her glanc
the decis onc made a glow of strang enjoy threw it
flicker bright over the troubl of hi breast it wa the
exhilar effectupon a prison just escap from the dungeon of
hi own heartof breath the wild free atmospher of an unredeem
unchristianis lawless region hi spirit rose as it were with a
bound and attain a nearer prospect of the sky than throughout all
the miseri which had kept him grovel on the earth of a deepli
religi tempera there wa inevit a ting of the devot
in hi mood
do i feel joi again cri he wonder at himself methought the
germ of it wa dead in me oh hester thou art my better angel i seem
to have flung myselfsick sinstain and sorrowblackeneddown upon
these forest leav and to have risen up all made anew and with new
power to glorifi him that hath been merci thi is alreadi the
better life why did we not find it sooner
let us not look back answer hester prynn the past is gone
wherefor should we linger upon it now see with thi symbol i undo it
all and make it as if it had never been
so speak she undid the clasp that fasten the scarlet letter and
take it from her bosom threw it to a distanc among the wither
leav the mystic token alight on the hither verg of the stream
with a handsbreadth further flight it would have fallen into the
water and have given the littl brook anoth woe to carri onward
besid the unintellig tale which it still kept murmur about
but there lai the embroid letter glitter like a lost jewel
which some illfat wander might pick up and thenceforth be haunt
by strang phantom of guilt sink of the heart and unaccount
misfortun
the stigma gone hester heav a long deep sigh in which the burden
of shame and anguish depart from her spirit o exquisit relief she
had not known the weight until she felt the freedom by anoth
impuls she took off the formal cap that confin her hair and down
it fell upon her shoulder dark and rich with at onc a shadow and a
light in it abund and impart the charm of soft to her
featur there plai around her mouth and beam out of her ey a
radiant and tender smile that seem gush from the veri heart of
womanhood a crimson flush wa glow on her cheek that had been long
so pale her sex her youth and the whole rich of her beauti came
back from what men call the irrevoc past and cluster themselv
with her maiden hope and a happi befor unknown within the magic
circl of thi hour and as if the gloom of the earth and sky had been
but the effluenc of these two mortal heart it vanish with their
sorrow all at onc as with a sudden smile of heaven forth burst the
sunshin pour a veri flood into the obscur forest gladden each
green leaf transmut the yellow fallen on to gold and gleam
adown the grai trunk of the solemn tree the object that had made a
shadow hitherto embodi the bright now the cours of the littl
brook might be trace by it merri gleam afar into the wood heart of
mysteri which had becom a mysteri of joi
such wa the sympathi of naturethat wild heathen natur of the
forest never subjug by human law nor illumin by higher
truthwith the bliss of these two spirit love whether newlyborn or
arous from a deathlik slumber must alwai creat a sunshin
fill the heart so full of radianc that it overflow upon the
outward world had the forest still kept it gloom it would have been
bright in hester ey and bright in arthur dimmesdal
hester look at him with a thrill of anoth joi

hester smile and again call to pearl who wa visibl at some
distanc as the minist had describ her like a brightapparel
vision in a sunbeam which fell down upon her through an arch of
bough the rai quiver to and fro make her figur dim or
distinctnow like a real child now like a child spirita the
splendour went and came again she heard her mother voic and

in her hair it is as if on of the fairi whom we left in dear old
england had deck her out to meet us
it wa with a feel which neither of them had ever befor
experienc that thei sat and watch pearl slow advanc in her wa
visibl the tie that unit them she had been offer to the world
these seven past year as the live hieroglyph in which wa

the child hath strong affect she love me and will love thee
thou canst not think said the minist glanc asid at hester
prynn how my heart dread thi interview and yearn for it but in
truth as i alreadi told thee children ar not readili won to be
familiar with me thei will not climb my knee nor prattl in my ear

hous of yonder stern old governor
and thou didst plead so brave in her behalf and mine answer the
mother i rememb it and so shall littl pearl fear noth she
mai be strang and shy at first but will soon learn to love thee
by thi time pearl had reach the margin of the brook and stood on
the further side gaze silent at hester and the clergyman who
still sat togeth on the mossi treetrunk wait to receiv her just
where she had paus the brook chanc to form a pool so smooth and
quiet that it reflect a perfect imag of her littl figur with all
the brilliant picturesqu of her beauti in it adorn of
flower and wreath foliag but more refin and spiritu than
the realiti thi imag so nearli ident with the live pearl
seem to commun somewhat of it own shadowi and intang
qualiti to the child herself it wa strang the wai in which pearl
stood look so steadfastli at them through the dim medium of the
forest gloom herself meanwhil all glorifi with a rai of sunshin
that wa attract thitherward as by a certain sympathi in the brook
beneath stood anoth childanoth and the samewith likewis it rai
of golden light hester felt herself in some indistinct and
tantal manner estrang from pearl as if the child in her
lone rambl through the forest had strai out of the sphere in
which she and her mother dwelt togeth and wa now vainli seek to
return to it
there were both truth and error in the impress the child and mother
were estrang but through hester fault not pearl sinc the
latter rambl from her side anoth inmat had been admit within
the circl of the mother feel and so modifi the aspect of them
all that pearl the return wander could not find her wont
place and hardli knew where she wa
i have a strang fanci observ the sensit minist that thi
brook is the boundari between two world and that thou canst never
meet thy pearl again or is she an elfish spirit who as the legend
of our childhood taught us is forbidden to cross a run stream
prai hasten her for thi delai ha alreadi impart a tremor to my
nerv
come dearest child said hester encouragingli and stretch out
both her arm how slow thou art when hast thou been so sluggish
befor now here is a friend of mine who must be thy friend also thou
wilt have twice as much love henceforward as thy mother alon could
give thee leap across the brook and come to us thou canst leap like a
young deer
pearl without respond in ani manner to these honeysweet
express remain on the other side of the brook now she fix her
bright wild ey on her mother now on the minist and now includ
them both in the same glanc as if to detect and explain to herself
the relat which thei bore to on anoth for some unaccount
reason as arthur dimmesdal felt the child ey upon himself hi
handwith that gestur so habitu as to have becom involuntarystol
over hi heart at length assum a singular air of author pearl
stretch out her hand with the small forefing extend and
point evid toward her mother breast and beneath in the
mirror of the brook there wa the flowergirdl and sunni imag of
littl pearl point her small forefing too
thou strang child why dost thou not come to me exclaim hester
pearl still point with her forefing and a frown gather on her
browth more impress from the childish the almost babylik aspect
of the featur that convei it as her mother still kept beckon to
her and arrai her face in a holidai suit of unaccustom smile
the child stamp her foot with a yet more imperi look and gestur
in the brook again wa the fantast beauti of the imag with it
reflect frown it point finger and imperi gestur give
emphasi to the aspect of littl pearl
hasten pearl or i shall be angri with thee cri hester prynn
who howev inur to such behaviour on the elfchild part at other
season wa natur anxiou for a more seemli deport now leap
across the brook naughti child and run hither els i must come to
thee
but pearl not a whit startl at her mother threat ani more than
mollifi by her entreati now suddenli burst into a fit of passion
gesticul violent and throw her small figur into the most
extravag contort she accompani thi wild outbreak with
pierc shriek which the wood reverber on all side so that
alon as she wa in her childish and unreason wrath it seem as
if a hidden multitud were lend her their sympathi and
encourag seen in the brook onc more wa the shadowi wrath of
pearl imag crown and girdl with flower but stamp it foot
wildli gesticul and in the midst of all still point it
small forefing at hester bosom
i see what ail the child whisper hester to the clergyman and
turn pale in spite of a strong effort to conceal her troubl and
annoy children will not abid ani the slightest chang in the
accustom aspect of thing that ar daili befor their ey pearl
miss someth that she ha alwai seen me wear
i prai you answer the minist if thou hast ani mean of
pacifi the child do it forthwith save it were the canker wrath
of an old witch like mistress hibbin ad he attempt to smile
i know noth that i would not sooner encount than thi passion in
a child in pearl young beauti as in the wrinkl witch it ha a
preternatur effect pacifi her if thou lovest me
hester turn again toward pearl with a crimson blush upon her cheek
a consciou glanc asid at the clergyman and then a heavi sigh
while even befor she had time to speak the blush yield to a deadli
pallor
pearl said she sadli look down at thy feet therebefor theeon
the hither side of the brook
the child turn her ey to the point indic and there lai the
scarlet letter so close upon the margin of the stream that the gold
embroideri wa reflect in it
bring it hither said hester
come thou and take it up answer pearl
wa ever such a child observ hester asid to the minist oh i
have much to tell thee about her but in veri truth she is right as
regard thi hate token i must bear it tortur yet a littl
longeronli a few dai longeruntil we shall have left thi region and
look back hither as to a land which we have dream of the forest
cannot hide it the midocean shall take it from my hand and swallow
it up for ever
with these word she advanc to the margin of the brook took up the
scarlet letter and fasten it again into her bosom hopefulli but a
moment ago as hester had spoken of drown it in the deep sea there
wa a sens of inevit doom upon her as she thu receiv back thi
deadli symbol from the hand of fate she had flung it into infinit
space she had drawn an hour free breath and here again wa the
scarlet miseri glitter on the old spot so it ever is whether thu
typifi or no that an evil deed invest itself with the charact of
doom hester next gather up the heavi tress of her hair and
confin them beneath her cap as if there were a wither spell in
the sad letter her beauti the warmth and rich of her womanhood
depart like fade sunshin and a grai shadow seem to fall across
her
when the dreari chang wa wrought she extend her hand to pearl
dost thou know thy mother now child ask she reproachfulli but
with a subdu tone wilt thou come across the brook and own thy
mother now that she ha her shame upon hernow that she is sad
ye now i will answer the child bound across the brook and
clasp hester in her arm now thou art my mother inde and i am
thy littl pearl
in a mood of tender that wa not usual with her she drew down her
mother head and kiss her brow and both her cheek but thenbi a
kind of necess that alwai impel thi child to alloi whatev
comfort she might chanc to give with a throb of anguishpearl put up
her mouth and kiss the scarlet letter too
that wa not kind said hester when thou hast shown me a littl
love thou mockest me
why doth the minist sit yonder ask pearl
he wait to welcom thee repli her mother come thou and entreat
hi bless he love thee my littl pearl and love thy mother
too wilt thou not love him come he long to greet thee
doth he love us said pearl look up with acut intellig into
her mother face will he go back with us hand in hand we three
togeth into the town
not now my child answer hester but in dai to come he will walk
hand in hand with us we will have a home and firesid of our own and
thou shalt sit upon hi knee and he will teach thee mani thing and
love thee dearli thou wilt love himwilt thou not
and will he alwai keep hi hand over hi heart inquir pearl
foolish child what a question is that exclaim her mother come
and ask hi bless
but whether influenc by the jealousi that seem instinct with
everi pet child toward a danger rival or from whatev capric
of her freakish natur pearl would show no favour to the clergyman it
wa onli by an exert of forc that her mother brought her up to him
hang back and manifest her reluct by odd grimac of which
ever sinc her babyhood she had possess a singular varieti and
could transform her mobil physiognomi into a seri of differ
aspect with a new mischief in them each and all the
ministerpainfulli embarrass but hope that a kiss might prove a
talisman to admit him into the child kindlier regardsb forward
and impress on on her brow hereupon pearl broke awai from her
mother and run to the brook stoop over it and bath her
forehead until the unwelcom kiss wa quit wash off and diffus
through a long laps of the glide water she then remain apart
silent watch hester and the clergyman while thei talk togeth
and made such arrang as were suggest by their new posit and
the purpos soon to be fulfil
and now thi fate interview had come to a close the dell wa to be
left in solitud among it dark old tree which with their
multitudin tongu would whisper long of what had pass there and
no mortal be the wiser and the melancholi brook would add thi other
tale to the mysteri with which it littl heart wa alreadi
overburden and whereof it still kept up a murmur babbl with not
a whit more cheer of tone than for ag heretofor
xx
the minist in a maze
as the minist depart in advanc of hester prynn and littl pearl
he threw a backward glanc half expect that he should discov onli
some faintli trace featur or outlin of the mother and the child
slowli fade into the twilight of the wood so great a vicissitud in
hi life could not at onc be receiv as real but there wa hester
clad in her grai robe still stand besid the treetrunk which some
blast had overthrown a long antiqu ago and which time had ever
sinc been cover with moss so that these two fate on with
earth heaviest burden on them might there sit down togeth and
find a singl hour rest and solac and there wa pearl too lightli
danc from the margin of the brooknow that the intrus third
person wa goneand take her old place by her mother side so the
minist had not fallen asleep and dream
in order to free hi mind from thi indistinct and duplic of
impress which vex it with a strang disquietud he recal and
more thoroughli defin the plan which hester and himself had sketch
for their departur it had been determin between them that the old
world with it crowd and citi offer them a more elig shelter
and conceal than the wild of new england or all america with it
altern of an indian wigwam or the few settlement of european
scatter thinli along the seaboard not to speak of the clergyman
health so inadequ to sustain the hardship of a forest life hi
nativ gift hi cultur and hi entir develop would secur him
a home onli in the midst of civil and refin the higher the

chariti had brought her acquaint with the captain and crewcould
take upon herself to secur the passag of two individu and a child
with all the secreci which circumst render more than desir
the minist had inquir of hester with no littl interest the
precis time at which the vessel might be expect to depart it would
probabl be on the fourth dai from the present thi is most
fortun he had then said to himself now why the reverend mr
dimmesdal consid it so veri fortun we hesit to reveal
neverthelessto hold noth back from the readerit wa becaus on
the third dai from the present he wa to preach the elect sermon
and as such an occas form an honour epoch in the life of a
new england clergyman he could not have chanc upon a more suitabl
mode and time of termin hi profession career at least thei
shall sai of me thought thi exemplari man that i leav no public

so profound and acut as thi poor minist should be so miser
deceiv we have had and mai still have wors thing to tell of him
but none we apprehend so pitiabl weak no evid at onc so

the excit of mr dimmesdal feel as he return from hi

unweari activ that astonish him he could not but recal how
feebli and with what frequent paus for breath he had toil over the

yet the minist deepest sens seem to inform him of their
mutabl a similar impress struck him most remark as he
pass under the wall of hi own church the edific had so veri
strang and yet so familiar an aspect that mr dimmesdal mind
vibrat between two idea either that he had seen it onli in a dream
hitherto or that he wa mere dream about it now
thi phenomenon in the variou shape which it assum indic no
extern chang but so sudden and import a chang in the spectat
of the familiar scene that the interven space of a singl dai had
oper on hi conscious like the laps of year the minist
own will and hester will and the fate that grew between them had
wrought thi transform it wa the same town as heretofor but
the same minist return not from the forest he might have said to
the friend who greet himi am not the man for whom you take me i
left him yonder in the forest withdrawn into a secret dell by a mossi

hi friend no doubt would still have insist with himthou art

evid of a revolut in the sphere of thought and feel in
truth noth short of a total chang of dynasti and moral code in
that interior kingdom wa adequ to account for the impuls now
commun to the unfortun and startl minist at everi step he

patriarch deacon would have been petrifi by hi minist impieti
again anoth incid of the same natur hurri along the street
the reverend mr dimmesdal encount the eldest femal member of hi

with a heart as full of reminisc about her dead husband and
children and her dead friend of long ago as a burialground is full
of stori graveston yet all thi which would els have been such
heavi sorrow wa made almost a solemn joi to her devout old soul by
religi consol and the truth of scriptur wherewith she had
fed herself continu for more than thirti year and sinc mr
dimmesdal had taken her in charg the good grandam chief earthli
comfortwhich unless it had been likewis a heavenli comfort could
have been none at allwa to meet her pastor whether casual or of
set purpos and be refresh with a word of warm fragrant
heavenbreath gospel truth from hi belov lip into her dull
but raptur attent ear but on thi occas up to the moment
of put hi lip to the old woman ear mr dimmesdal as the
great enemi of soul would have it could recal no text of scriptur
nor aught els except a brief pithi and as it then appear to him
unanswer argument against the immort of the human soul the
instil thereof into her mind would probabl have caus thi ag
sister to drop down dead at onc as by the effect of an intens
poison infus what he realli did whisper the minist could
never afterward recollect there wa perhap a fortun disord in
hi utter which fail to impart ani distinct idea to the good
widow comprehens or which provid interpret after a method
of it own assuredli as the minist look back he beheld an
express of divin gratitud and ecstasi that seem like the shine
of the celesti citi on her face so wrinkl and ashi pale
again a third instanc after part from the old church member he
met the youngest sister of them all it wa a maiden newlywonand won
by the reverend mr dimmesdal own sermon on the sabbath after hi
vigilto barter the transitori pleasur of the world for the heavenli
hope that wa to assum brighter substanc as life grew dark around
her and which would gild the utter gloom with final glori she wa
fair and pure as a lili that had bloom in paradis the minist knew
well that he wa himself enshrin within the stainless sanctiti of her
heart which hung it snowi curtain about hi imag impart to
religion the warmth of love and to love a religi puriti satan
that afternoon had sure led the poor young girl awai from her
mother side and thrown her into the pathwai of thi sore tempt
orshal we not rather saythi lost and desper man as she drew
nigh the archfiend whisper him to condens into small compass and
drop into her tender bosom a germ of evil that would be sure to blossom
darkli soon and bear black fruit betim such wa hi sens of power
over thi virgin soul trust him as she did that the minist felt
potent to blight all the field of innoc with but on wick look
and develop all it opposit with but a word sowith a mightier
struggl than he had yet sustainedh held hi geneva cloak befor hi

the young sister to digest hi rude as she might she ransack her
consciencewhich wa full of harmless littl matter like her pocket
or her workbagand took herself to task poor thing for a thousand
imaginari fault and went about her household duti with swollen
eyelid the next morn
befor the minist had time to celebr hi victori over thi last
temptat he wa consciou of anoth impuls more ludicr and
almost as horribl it wasw blush to tell itit wa to stop short in
the road and teach some veri wick word to a knot of littl puritan
children who were plai there and had but just begun to talk
deni himself thi freak as unworthi of hi cloth he met a drunken
seaman on of the ship crew from the spanish main and here sinc
he had so valiantli forborn all other wicked poor mr dimmesdal
long at least to shake hand with the tarri blackguard and recreat
himself with a few improp jest such as dissolut sailor so abound

return out of the foresta wiser onewith a knowledg of hidden
mysteri which the simplic of the former never could have reach
a bitter kind of knowledg that
while occupi with these reflect a knock came at the door of the

that he might behold an evil spirit and so he did it wa old roger

the clamour and rude deport of these jolli seafar men and it
excit neither surpris nor animadvers when so reput a citizen
as old roger chillingworth the physician wa seen to enter the
marketplac in close and familiar talk with the command of the
question vessel
the latter wa by far the most showi and gallant figur so far as
apparel went anywher to be seen among the multitud he wore a
profus of ribbon on hi garment and gold lace on hi hat which
wa also encircl by a gold chain and surmount with a feather
there wa a sword at hi side and a swordcut on hi forehead which
by the arrang of hi hair he seem anxiou rather to displai
than hide a landsman could hardli have worn thi garb and shown thi

undergo stern question befor a magistr and probabl incur a
fine or imprison or perhap an exhibit in the stock as

after part from the physician the command of the bristol ship
stroll idli through the marketplac until happen to approach the
spot where hester prynn wa stand he appear to recognis and
did not hesit to address her as wa usual the case wherev
hester stood a small vacant areaa sort of magic circlehad form
itself about her into which though the peopl were elbow on
anoth at a littl distanc none ventur or felt dispos to

scarlet letter envelop it fate wearer partli by her own reserv
and partli by the instinct though no longer so unkindli withdraw
of her fellowcreatur now if never befor it answer a good
purpos by enabl hester and the seaman to speak togeth without
risk of be overheard and so chang wa hester prynn reput
befor the public that the matron in town most emin for rigid
moral could not have held such intercours with less result of
scandal than herself
so mistress said the marin i must bid the steward make readi
on more berth than you bargain for no fear of scurvi or ship fever
thi voyag what with the ship surgeon and thi other doctor our
onli danger will be from drug or pill more by token as there is a lot
of apothecari stuff aboard which i trade for with a spanish

what mean you inquir hester startl more than she permit to

why know you not cri the shipmast that thi physician
herechillingworth he call himselfi mind to try my cabinfar with

thei know each other well inde repli hester with a mien of
calm though in the utmost constern thei have long dwelt
togeth
noth further pass between the marin and hester prynn but at
that instant she beheld old roger chillingworth himself stand in
the remotest corner of the marketplac and smile on her a smile
whichacross the wide and bustl squar and through all the talk and
laughter and variou thought mood and interest of the

the process
befor hester prynn could call togeth her thought and consid
what wa practic to be done in thi new and startl aspect of

contigu street it denot the advanc of the process of
magistr and citizen on it wai toward the meetinghous where
in complianc with a custom thu earli establish and ever sinc

for thee foolish child that thou didst not speak to him
anoth shade of the same sentiment in refer to mr dimmesdal

anoth auditor she took up her posit close besid the scaffold of
the pillori it wa in suffici proxim to bring the whole sermon
to her ear in the shape of an indistinct but vari murmur and flow
of the minist veri peculiar voic
thi vocal organ wa in itself a rich endow insomuch that a

spoke might still have been swai to and fro by the mere tone and

chillingworth knelt down besid him with a blank dull counten
out of which the life seem to have depart
thou hast escap me he repeat more than onc thou hast escap

he withdrew hi dy ey from the old man and fix them on the
woman and the child

smile over hi face as of a spirit sink into deep repos nai now

she would grow up amid human joi and sorrow nor forev do battl with

xxiv
conclus
after mani dai when time suffic for the peopl to arrang their
thought in refer to the forego scene there wa more than on
account of what had been wit on the scaffold
most of the spectat testifi to have seen on the breast of the
unhappi minist a scarlet letterth veri semblanc of that worn by
hester prynneimprint in the flesh as regard it origin there were
variou explan all of which must necessarili have been
conjectur some affirm that the reverend mr dimmesdal on the
veri dai when hester prynn first wore her ignomini badg had begun
a cours of penancewhich he afterward in so mani futil method
follow outbi inflict a hideou tortur on himself other
contend that the stigma had not been produc until a long time
subsequ when old roger chillingworth be a potent necromanc
had caus it to appear through the agenc of magic and poison
drug other again and those best abl to appreci the minist
peculiar sensibl and the wonder oper of hi spirit upon
the bodywhisp their belief that the aw symbol wa the effect
of the everact tooth of remors gnaw from the inmost heart
outwardli and at last manifest heaven dread judgment by the
visibl presenc of the letter the reader mai choos among these
theori we have thrown all the light we could acquir upon the
portent and would gladli now that it ha done it offic eras it
deep print out of our own brain where long medit ha fix it in
veri undesir distinct
it is singular nevertheless that certain person who were spectat
of the whole scene and profess never onc to have remov their ey
from the reverend mr dimmesdal deni that there wa ani mark
whatev on hi breast more than on a newborn infant neither by
their report had hi dy word acknowledg nor even remot
impli anyth slightestconnexion on hi part with the guilt for
which hester prynn had so long worn the scarlet letter accord to
these highlyrespect wit the minist consciou that he wa
dyingconsci also that the rever of the multitud place him
alreadi among saint and angelshad desir by yield up hi breath
in the arm of that fallen woman to express to the world how utterli
nugatori is the choicest of man own righteous after exhaust
life in hi effort for mankind spiritu good he had made the
manner of hi death a parabl in order to impress on hi admir the
mighti and mourn lesson that in the view of infinit puriti we
ar sinner all alik it wa to teach them that the holiest amongst
us ha but attain so far abov hi fellow as to discern more clearli
the merci which look down and repudi more utterli the phantom of
human merit which would look aspiringli upward without disput a
truth so moment we must be allow to consid thi version of mr
dimmesdal stori as onli an instanc of that stubborn fidel with
which a man friendsand especi a clergymanswil sometim
uphold hi charact when proof clear as the middai sunshin on the
scarlet letter establish him a fals and sinstain creatur of the
dust
the author which we have chiefli followeda manuscript of old date
drawn up from the verbal testimoni of individu some of whom had
known hester prynn while other had heard the tale from contemporari
wit fulli confirm the view taken in the forego page among
mani moral which press upon us from the poor minist miser
experi we put onli thi into a sentenceb true be true be
true show freeli to the world if not your worst yet some trait
wherebi the worst mai be infer
noth wa more remark than the chang which took place almost
immedi after mr dimmesdal death in the appear and
demeanour of the old man known as roger chillingworth all hi strength
and energyal hi vital and intellectu forceseem at onc to
desert him insomuch that he posit wither up shrivel awai
and almost vanish from mortal sight like an uproot weed that li
wilt in the sun thi unhappi man had made the veri principl of hi
life to consist in the pursuit and systemat exercis of reveng and
when by it completest triumph consumm that evil principl wa
left with no further materi to support itwhen in short there wa
no more devil work on earth for him to do it onli remain for the
unhumanis mortal to betak himself whither hi master would find him
task enough and pai him hi wage duli but to all these shadowi
be so long our near acquaintancesa well roger chillingworth as
hi companion we would fain be merci it is a curiou subject of
observ and inquiri whether hatr and love be not the same thing
at bottom each in it utmost develop suppos a high degre of
intimaci and heartknowledg each render on individu depend for
the food of hi affect and spiritu fife upon anoth each leav
the passion lover or the no less passion hater forlorn and
desol by the withdraw of hi subject philosoph consid
therefor the two passion seem essenti the same except that on
happen to be seen in a celesti radianc and the other in a duski
and lurid glow in the spiritu world the old physician and the
ministermutu victim as thei have beenmai unawar have found
their earthli stock of hatr and antipathi transmut into golden
love
leav thi discuss apart we have a matter of busi to
commun to the reader at old roger chillingworth deceas which
took place within the year and by hi last will and testament of
which governor bellingham and the reverend mr wilson were executor
he bequeath a veri consider amount of properti both here and in
england to littl pearl the daughter of hester prynn
so pearlth elf childth demon offspr as some peopl up to that
epoch persist in consid herbecam the richest heiress of her
dai in the new world not improb thi circumst wrought a veri
materi chang in the public estim and had the mother and child
remain here littl pearl at a marriag period of life might have
mingl her wild blood with the lineag of the devoutest puritan among
them all but in no long time after the physician death the wearer
of the scarlet letter disappear and pearl along with her for mani
year though a vagu report would now and then find it wai across the
sealik a shapeless piec of driftwood toss ashor with the initi
of a name upon ityet no tide of them unquestion authent were
receiv the stori of the scarlet letter grew into a legend it
spell howev wa still potent and kept the scaffold aw where the
poor minist had di and likewis the cottag by the seashor where
hester prynn had dwelt near thi latter spot on afternoon some
children were at plai when thei beheld a tall woman in a grai robe
approach the cottagedoor in all those year it had never onc been
open but either she unlock it or the decai wood and iron
yield to her hand or she glide shadowlik through these
impedimentsand at all event went in
on the threshold she pausedturn partli roundfor perchanc the idea
of enter alon and all so chang the home of so intens a former
life wa more dreari and desol than even she could bear but her
hesit wa onli for an instant though long enough to displai a
scarlet letter on her breast
and hester prynn had return and taken up her longforsaken shame
but where wa littl pearl if still aliv she must now have been in
the flush and bloom of earli womanhood none knewnor ever learn with
the ful of perfect certaintywheth the elfchild had gone thu
untim to a maiden grave or whether her wild rich natur had been
soften and subdu and made capabl of a woman gentl happi
but through the remaind of hester life there were indic that
the reclus of the scarlet letter wa the object of love and interest
with some inhabit of anoth land letter came with armori seal
upon them though of bear unknown to english heraldri in the
cottag there were articl of comfort and luxuri such as hester never
care to us but which onli wealth could have purchas and affect
have imagin for her there were trifl too littl ornament
beauti token of a continu remembr that must have been
wrought by delic finger at the impuls of a fond heart and onc
hester wa seen embroid a babygar with such a lavish rich
of golden fanci as would have rais a public tumult had ani infant
thu apparel been shown to our soberhu commun
in fine the gossip of that dai believedand mr surveyor pue who
made investig a centuri later believedand on of hi recent
successor in offic moreov faithfulli believesthat pearl wa not
onli aliv but marri and happi and mind of her mother and that
she would most joyfulli have entertain that sad and lone mother at
her firesid
but there wa a more real life for hester prynn here in new england
than in that unknown region where pearl had found a home here had been
her sin here her sorrow and here wa yet to be her penit she
had return therefor and resumedof her own free will for not the
sternest magistr of that iron period would have impos itresum
the symbol of which we have relat so dark a tale never afterward
did it quit her bosom but in the laps of the toilsom thought
and selfdevot year that made up hester life the scarlet letter
ceas to be a stigma which attract the world scorn and bitter
and becam a type of someth to be sorrow over and look upon
with aw yet with rever too and as hester prynn had no selfish
end nor live in ani measur for her own profit and enjoy peopl
brought all their sorrow and perplex and besought her counsel
as on who had herself gone through a mighti troubl women more
especiallyin the continu recur trial of wound wast
wrong misplac or er and sin passionor with the dreari
burden of a heart unyield becaus unvalu and unsought came to
hester cottag demand why thei were so wretch and what the
remedi hester comfort and counsel them as best she might she
assur them too of her firm belief that at some brighter period
when the world should have grown ripe for it in heaven own time a
new truth would be reveal in order to establish the whole relat
between man and woman on a surer ground of mutual happi earlier in
life hester had vainli imagin that she herself might be the destin
prophetess but had long sinc recognis the imposs that ani
mission of divin and mysteri truth should be confid to a woman
stain with sin bow down with shame or even burden with a
lifelong sorrow the angel and apostl of the come revel must
be a woman inde but lofti pure and beauti and wise moreov
not through duski grief but the ether medium of joi and show
how sacr love should make us happi by the truest test of a life
success to such an end
so said hester prynn and glanc her sad ey downward at the scarlet
letter and after mani mani year a new grave wa delv near an
old and sunken on in that burialground besid which king chapel
ha sinc been built it wa near that old and sunken grave yet with a
space between as if the dust of the two sleeper had no right to
mingl yet on tombston serv for both all around there were
monument carv with armori bear and on thi simpl slab of
slatea the curiou investig mai still discern and perplex
himself with the purportther appear the semblanc of an engrav
