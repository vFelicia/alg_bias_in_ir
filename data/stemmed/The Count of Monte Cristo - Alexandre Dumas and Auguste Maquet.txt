chapter 1 marseillesth arriv
on the 24th of februari 1815 the lookout at notredam de la gard
signal the threemast the pharaon from smyrna triest and
napl
as usual a pilot put off immedi and round the chteau dif
got on board the vessel between cape morgiou and rion island
immedi and accord to custom the rampart of fort saintjean
were cover with spectat it is alwai an event at marseil for a
ship to come into port especi when thi ship like the pharaon
ha been built rig and laden at the old phoce dock and belong
to an owner of the citi
the ship drew on and had safe pass the strait which some volcan
shock ha made between the calasareign and jaro island had doubl
pomgu and approach the harbor under topsail jib and spanker
but so slowli and sedat that the idler with that instinct which is
the forerunn of evil ask on anoth what misfortun could have
happen on board howev those experienc in navig saw plainli
that if ani accid had occur it wa not to the vessel herself
for she bore down with all the evid of be skilfulli handl the
anchor acockbil the jibboom gui alreadi eas off and stand by
the side of the pilot who wa steer the pharaon toward the
narrow entranc of the inner port wa a young man who with activ
and vigil ey watch everi motion of the ship and repeat each
direct of the pilot
the vagu disquietud which prevail among the spectat had so much
affect on of the crowd that he did not await the arriv of the
vessel in harbor but jump into a small skiff desir to be pull
alongsid the pharaon which he reach as she round into la
rserv basin
when the young man on board saw thi person approach he left hi
station by the pilot and hat in hand lean over the ship
bulwark
he wa a fine tall slim young fellow of eighteen or twenti with
black ey and hair as dark as a raven wing and hi whole
appear bespok that calm and resolut peculiar to men
accustom from their cradl to contend with danger
ah is it you dant cri the man in the skiff what the
matter and why have you such an air of sad aboard
a great misfortun m morrel repli the young man a great
misfortun for me especi off civita vecchia we lost our brave
captain lecler
and the cargo inquir the owner eagerli
is all safe m morrel and i think you will be satisfi on that
head but poor captain lecler
what happen to him ask the owner with an air of consider
resign what happen to the worthi captain
he di
fell into the sea
no sir he di of brainfev in dread agoni then turn to
the crew he said bear a hand there to take in sail
all hand obei and at onc the eight or ten seamen who compos the
crew sprang to their respect station at the spanker brail and
outhaul topsail sheet and halyard the jib downhaul and the topsail
clewlin and buntlin the young sailor gave a look to see that hi
order were promptli and accur obei and then turn again to
the owner
and how did thi misfortun occur inquir the latter resum the
interrupt convers
0023m
ala sir in the most unexpect manner after a long talk with the
harbormast captain lecler left napl greatli disturb in mind
in twentyfour hour he wa attack by a fever and di three dai
afterward we perform the usual burial servic and he is at hi
rest sewn up in hi hammock with a thirtysixpound shot at hi head
and hi heel off el giglio island we bring to hi widow hi sword
and cross of honor it wa worth while truli ad the young man
with a melancholi smile to make war against the english for ten
year and to die in hi bed at last like everybodi els
why you see edmond repli the owner who appear more comfort
at everi moment we ar all mortal and the old must make wai for the
young if not why there would be no promot and sinc you assur
me that the cargo
is all safe and sound m morrel take my word for it and i advis
you not to take 25000 franc for the profit of the voyag
then as thei were just pass the round tower the young man shout
stand by there to lower the topsail and jib brail up the spanker
the order wa execut as promptli as it would have been on board a
manofwar
let goand clue up at thi last command all the sail were lower
and the vessel move almost impercept onward
now if you will come on board m morrel said dant observ the
owner impati here is your supercargo m danglar come out
of hi cabin who will furnish you with everi particular as for me i
must look after the anchor and dress the ship in mourn
the owner did not wait for a second invit he seiz a rope which
dant flung to him and with an activ that would have done credit
to a sailor climb up the side of the ship while the young man
go to hi task left the convers to danglar who now came
toward the owner he wa a man of twentyf or twentysix year of
ag of unprepossess counten obsequi to hi superior
insol to hi subordin and thi in addit to hi posit as
respons agent on board which is alwai obnoxi to the sailor
made him as much dislik by the crew as edmond dant wa belov by
them
well m morrel said danglar you have heard of the misfortun
that ha befallen us
yesy poor captain lecler he wa a brave and an honest man
and a firstrat seaman on who had seen long and honor servic
as becam a man charg with the interest of a hous so import as
that of morrel son repli danglar
but repli the owner glanc after dant who wa watch the
anchor of hi vessel it seem to me that a sailor need not be so
old as you sai danglar to understand hi busi for our friend
edmond seem to understand it thoroughli and not to requir
instruct from anyon
ye said danglar dart at edmond a look gleam with hate
ye he is young and youth is invari selfconfid scarc wa
the captain breath out of hi bodi when he assum the command
without consult anyon and he caus us to lose a dai and a half at
the island of elba instead of make for marseil direct
0025m
as to take command of the vessel repli morrel that wa hi
duti as captain mate as to lose a dai and a half off the island of
elba he wa wrong unless the vessel need repair
the vessel wa in as good condit as i am and as i hope you ar
m morrel and thi dai and a half wa lost from pure whim for the
pleasur of go ashor and noth els
dant said the shipown turn toward the young man come thi
wai
in a moment sir answer dant and im with you then call
to the crew he said let go
the anchor wa instantli drop and the chain ran rattl through
the porthol dant continu at hi post in spite of the presenc of
the pilot until thi manuvr wa complet and then he ad
halfmast the color and squar the yard
you see said danglar he fanci himself captain alreadi upon my
word
and so in fact he is said the owner
except your signatur and your partner m morrel
and why should he not have thi ask the owner he is young it is
true but he seem to me a thorough seaman and of full experi
a cloud pass over danglar brow
your pardon m morrel said dant approach the vessel now
ride at anchor and i am at your servic you hail me i think
danglar retreat a step or two i wish to inquir why you stop
at the island of elba
i do not know sir it wa to fulfil the last instruct of captain
lecler who when dy gave me a packet for marshal bertrand
then did you see him edmond
who
the marshal
ye
morrel look around him and then draw dant on on side he said
suddenli
and how is the emperor
veri well as far as i could judg from the sight of him
you saw the emperor then
he enter the marshal apart while i wa there
and you spoke to him
why it wa he who spoke to me sir said dant with a smile
and what did he sai to you
ask me question about the vessel the time she left marseil the
cours she had taken and what wa her cargo i believ if she had not
been laden and i had been her master he would have bought her but i
told him i wa onli mate and that she belong to the firm of morrel
son ah ye he said i know them the morrel have been shipown
from father to son and there wa a morrel who serv in the same
regiment with me when i wa in garrison at valenc
pardieu and that is true cri the owner greatli delight and
that wa policar morrel my uncl who wa afterward a captain
dant you must tell my uncl that the emperor rememb him and you
will see it will bring tear into the old soldier ey come come
continu he pat edmond shoulder kindli you did veri right
dant to follow captain lecler instruct and touch at elba
although if it were known that you had convei a packet to the
marshal and had convers with the emperor it might bring you into
troubl
0027m
how could that bring me into troubl sir ask dant for i did
not even know of what i wa the bearer and the emperor mere made
such inquiri as he would of the first comer but pardon me here ar
the health offic and the custom inspector come alongsid and
the young man went to the gangwai as he depart danglar approach
and said
well it appear that he ha given you satisfactori reason for hi
land at portoferrajo
ye most satisfactori my dear danglar
well so much the better said the supercargo for it is not
pleasant to think that a comrad ha not done hi duti
dant ha done hi repli the owner and that is not sai much
it wa captain lecler who gave order for thi delai
talk of captain lecler ha not dant given you a letter from
him
to menowa there on
i believ that besid the packet captain lecler confid a letter
to hi care
of what packet ar you speak danglar
why that which dant left at portoferrajo
how do you know he had a packet to leav at portoferrajo
danglar turn veri red
i wa pass close to the door of the captain cabin which wa half
open and i saw him give the packet and letter to dant
he did not speak to me of it repli the shipown but if there be
ani letter he will give it to me

mistaken

sheet with the order that he be put ashor at la canebir the two
oarsmen bent to their work and the littl boat glide awai as rapidli
as possibl in the midst of the thousand vessel which choke up the
narrow wai which lead between the two row of ship from the mouth of
the harbor to the quai dorlan
the shipown smile follow him with hi ey until he saw him
spring out on the quai and disappear in the midst of the throng which
from five oclock in the morn until nine oclock at night swarm in
the famou street of la canebirea street of which the modern
phocen ar so proud that thei sai with all the graviti in the world
and with that accent which give so much charact to what is said if

spaniard that the spaniard rumin while the french invent
do you invent then said fernand impati
waiter said danglar pen ink and paper
pen ink and paper mutter fernand
ye i am a supercargo pen ink and paper ar my tool and without
my tool i am fit for noth
pen ink and paper then call fernand loudli
there what you want on that tabl said the waiter
bring them here the waiter did as he wa desir
0059m
when on think said caderouss let hi hand drop on the paper
there is here wherewith to kill a man more sure than if we wait at
the corner of a wood to assassin him i have alwai had more dread
of a pen a bottl of ink and a sheet of paper than of a sword or
pistol
the fellow is not so drunk as he appear to be said danglar give
him some more wine fernand fernand fill caderouss glass who
like the confirm toper he wa lift hi hand from the paper and
seiz the glass
the catalan watch him until caderouss almost overcom by thi fresh
assault on hi sens rest or rather drop hi glass upon the
tabl
well resum the catalan as he saw the final glimmer of
caderouss reason vanish befor the last glass of wine
well then i should sai for instanc resum danglar that if
after a voyag such as dant ha just made in which he touch at the
island of elba someon were to denounc him to the king procureur as
a bonapartist agent
i will denounc him exclaim the young man hastili
ye but thei will make you then sign your declar and confront
you with him you have denounc i will suppli you with the mean of
support your accus for i know the fact well but dant cannot
remain forev in prison and on dai or other he will leav it and
the dai when he come out woe betid him who wa the caus of hi
incarcer
oh i should wish noth better than that he would come and seek a
quarrel with me
ye and mercd mercd who will detest you if you have onli the
misfortun to scratch the skin of her dearli belov edmond
true said fernand
no no continu danglar if we resolv on such a step it would
be much better to take as i now do thi pen dip it into thi ink
and write with the left hand that the write mai not be recogn
the denunci we propos and danglar unit practic with
theori wrote with hi left hand and in a write revers from hi
usual style and total unlik it the follow line which he
hand to fernand and which fernand read in an underton
the honor the king attornei is inform by a friend of the
throne and religion that on edmond dant mate of the ship
pharaon arriv thi morn from smyrna after have touch at

committe in pari proof of thi crime will be found on arrest him
for the letter will be found upon him or at hi father or in hi
cabin on board the pharaon
veri good resum danglar now your reveng look like common

danglar and caderouss set off upon their errand at full speed but
er thei had gone mani step thei perceiv a group advanc toward

as danglar approach the disappoint lover he cast on him a look of
deep mean while fernand as he slowli pace behind the happi pair

and a nervou contract distort hi featur while with an agit
and restless gaze he would glanc in the direct of marseil like
on who either anticip or foresaw some great and import event
dant himself wa simpli but becomingli clad in the dress peculiar
to the merchant servicea costum somewhat between a militari and a
civil garb and with hi fine counten radiant with joi and
happi a more perfect specimen of manli beauti could scarc be
imagin
love as the greek girl of cypru or chio mercd boast the same
bright flash ey of jet and ripe round coral lip she move
with the light free step of an arlesienn or an andalusian on more
practic in the art of great citi would have hid her blush

lash so as to have conceal the liquid lustr of her anim ey
but on the contrari the delight girl look around her with a smile
that seem to sai if you ar my friend rejoic with me for i am

gentl smile to fernand but her word and look seem to inflict the
direst tortur on him for hi lip becam ghastli pale and even
beneath the dark hue of hi complexion the blood might be seen
retreat as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart
dure thi time dant at the opposit side of the tabl had been
occupi in similarli place hi most honor guest m morrel wa
seat at hi right hand danglar at hi left while at a sign from
edmond the rest of the compani rang themselv as thei found it most

brilliant color the echinu with it prickli outsid and dainti morsel
within the clovi esteem by the epicur of the south as more than

the bride blush while fernand restless and uneasi seem to start
at everi fresh sound and from time to time wipe awai the larg drop
of perspir that gather on hi brow
well never mind that neighbor caderouss it is not worthwhil to
contradict me for such a trifl as that ti true that mercd is not
actual my wife but ad he draw out hi watch in an hour
and a half she will be
a gener exclam of surpris ran round the tabl with the
except of the elder dant whose laugh displai the still perfect

thi prospect of fresh festiv redoubl the hilar of the guest
to such a degre that the elder dant who at the commenc of

difficult amid the gener din of voic to obtain a moment
tranquil in which to drink to the health and prosper of the
bride and bridegroom

damn unabl to rest he wa among the first to quit the tabl and
as though seek to avoid the hilari mirth that rose in such
deafen sound he continu in utter silenc to pace the farther
end of the salon
caderouss approach him just as danglar whom fernand seem most
anxiou to avoid had join him in a corner of the room
upon my word said caderouss from whose mind the friendli treatment
of dant unit with the effect of the excel wine he had partaken
of had effac everi feel of envi or jealousi at dant good
fortuneupon my word dant is a downright good fellow and when i

open window at the same instant hi ear caught a sort of indistinct
sound on the stair follow by the measur tread of soldieri with
the clank of sword and militari accoutr then came a hum and
buzz as of mani voic so as to deaden even the noisi mirth of the
bridal parti among whom a vagu feel of curios and apprehens

0081m
you see said danglar address caderouss the turn thing have
taken do you still feel ani desir to stand up in hi defenc
not the slightest but yet it seem to me a shock thing that a mere
joke should lead to such consequ
but who perpetr that joke let me ask neither you nor myself but
fernand you knew veri well that i threw the paper into a corner of the
roominde i fanci i had destroi it
oh no repli caderouss that i can answer for you did not i
onli wish i could see it now as plainli as i saw it ly all crush
and crumpl in a corner of the arbor
well then if you did depend upon it fernand pick it up and
either copi it or caus it to be copi perhap even he did not
take the troubl of recopi it and now i think of it by heaven he
mai have sent the letter itself fortun for me the handwrit
wa disguis
then you were awar of dant be engag in a conspiraci
not i as i befor said i thought the whole thing wa a joke noth
more it seem howev that i have unconsci stumbl upon the
truth
still argu caderouss i would give a great deal if noth of
the kind had happen or at least that i had had no hand in it you
will see danglar that it will turn out an unlucki job for both of
us
nonsens if ani harm come of it it should fall on the guilti person
and that you know is fernand how can we be implic in ani wai
all we have got to do is to keep our own counsel and remain perfectli
quiet not breath a word to ani live soul and you will see that
the storm will pass awai without in the least affect us
amen respond caderouss wave hi hand in token of adieu to
danglar and bend hi step toward the all de meilhan move
hi head to and fro and mutter as he went after the manner of on
whose mind wa overcharg with on absorb idea
so far then said danglar mental all ha gone as i would have

marquis marquis interpos the old nobleman who had propos the
toast let the young peopl alon let me tell you on on wed
dai there ar more agreeabl subject of convers than dry
polit
never mind dearest mother said a young and love girl with a
profus of light brown hair and ey that seem to float in liquid
crystal ti all my fault for seiz upon m de villefort so as to
prevent hi listen to what you said but therenow take himh is
your own for as long as you like m villefort i beg to remind you my
mother speak to you
if the marquis will deign to repeat the word i but imperfectli
caught i shall be delight to answer said m de villefort
never mind rene repli the marquis with a look of tender
that seem out of keep with her harsh dry featur but howev
all other feel mai be wither in a woman natur there is alwai
on bright smile spot in the desert of her heart and that is the
shrine of matern love i forgiv you what i wa sai villefort
wa that the bonapartist had not our sincer enthusiasm or
devot
thei had howev what suppli the place of those fine qualiti
repli the young man and that wa fanatic napoleon is the
mahomet of the west and is worship by hi commonplac but ambiti
follow not onli as a leader and lawgiv but also as the
personif of equal
he cri the marquis napoleon the type of equal for merci
sake then what would you call robespierr come come do not strip
the latter of hi just right to bestow them on the corsican who to
my mind ha usurp quit enough
0085m
nai madam i would place each of these hero on hi right
pedestalthat of robespierr on hi scaffold in the place loui quinz
that of napoleon on the column of the place vendm the onli
differ consist in the opposit charact of the equal advoc
by these two men on is the equal that elev the other is the
equal that degrad on bring a king within reach of the
guillotin the other elev the peopl to a level with the throne
observ said villefort smile i do not mean to deni that both
these men were revolutionari scoundrel and that the 9th thermidor and
the 4th of april in the year 1814 were lucki dai for franc worthi
of be gratefulli rememb by everi friend to monarchi and civil
order and that explain how it come to pass that fallen as i trust
he is forev napoleon ha still retain a train of parasit
satellit still marquis it ha been so with other
usurperscromwel for instanc who wa not half so bad as napoleon
had hi partisan and advoc
do you know villefort that you ar talk in a most dreadfulli
revolutionari strain but i excus it it is imposs to expect the
son of a girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven a
deep crimson suffus the counten of villefort
ti true madam answer he that my father wa a girondin but
he wa not among the number of those who vote for the king death he
wa an equal suffer with yourself dure the reign of terror and had
wellnigh lost hi head on the same scaffold on which your father
perish
true repli the marquis without winc in the slightest degre
at the tragic remembr thu call up but bear in mind if you
pleas that our respect parent underw persecut and
proscript from diametr opposit principl in proof of which
i mai remark that while my famili remain among the staunchest
adher of the exil princ your father lost no time in join
the new govern and that while the citizen noirtier wa a girondin
the count noirtier becam a senat
dear mother interpos rene you know veri well it wa agre that
all these disagre reminisc should forev be laid asid
suffer me also madam repli villefort to add my earnest
request to mademoisel de saintmran that you will kindli allow
the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past what avail
recrimin over matter wholli past recal for my own part i have
laid asid even the name of my father and altogeth disown hi
polit principl he wasnai probabl mai still bea bonapartist
and is call noirtier i on the contrari am a staunch royalist and
style myself de villefort let what mai remain of revolutionari sap
exhaust itself and die awai with the old trunk and condescend onli to
regard the young shoot which ha start up at a distanc from the
parent tree without have the power ani more than the wish to
separ entir from the stock from which it sprung
bravo villefort cri the marqui excel well said come
now i have hope of obtain what i have been for year endeavor
to persuad the marquis to promis name a perfect amnesti and
forget of the past
with all my heart repli the marquis let the past be forev
forgotten i promis you it afford me as littl pleasur to reviv
it as it doe you all i ask is that villefort will be firm and
inflex for the futur in hi polit principl rememb also
villefort that we have pledg ourselv to hi majesti for your
fealti and strict loyalti and that at our recommend the king
consent to forget the past as i do and here she extend to him
her handa i now do at your entreati but bear in mind that should
there fall in your wai anyon guilti of conspir against the
govern you will be so much the more bound to visit the offenc
with rigor punish as it is known you belong to a suspect
famili
ala madam return villefort my profess as well as the
time in which we live compel me to be sever i have alreadi
successfulli conduct sever public prosecut and brought the
offend to merit punish but we have not done with the thing
yet
0087m
do you inde think so inquir the marquis
i am at least fear of it napoleon in the island of elba is too
near franc and hi proxim keep up the hope of hi partisan
marseil is fill with halfpai offic who ar daili under on
frivol pretext or other get up quarrel with the royalist
from henc aris continu and fatal duel among the higher class of
person and assassin in the lower
you have heard perhap said the comt de salvieux on of m de
saintmran oldest friend and chamberlain to the comt dartoi
that the holi allianc purpos remov him from thenc
ye thei were talk about it when we left pari said m de
saintmran and where is it decid to transfer him
to saint helena
for heaven sake where is that ask the marquis
an island situat on the other side of the equat at least two
thousand leagu from here repli the count
so much the better as villefort observ it is a great act of folli
to have left such a man between corsica where he wa born and napl
of which hi brotherinlaw is king and face to face with itali the
sovereignti of which he covet for hi son
unfortun said villefort there ar the treati of 1814 and
we cannot molest napoleon without break those compact
oh well we shall find some wai out of it respond m de salvieux
there wasnt ani troubl over treati when it wa a question of
shoot the poor duc denghien
well said the marquis it seem probabl that by the aid of the
holi allianc we shall be rid of napoleon and we must trust to the
vigil of m de villefort to purifi marseil of hi partisan the
king is either a king or no king if he be acknowledg as sovereign of
franc he should be upheld in peac and tranquil and thi can
best be effect by emploi the most inflex agent to put down
everi attempt at conspiracyti the best and surest mean of
prevent mischief
unfortun madam answer villefort the strong arm of the law
is not call upon to interfer until the evil ha taken place
then all he ha got to do is to endeavor to repair it
nai madam the law is frequent powerless to effect thi all it
can do is to aveng the wrong done
oh m de villefort cri a beauti young creatur daughter to

onli be still more aggrav suppos for instanc the prison as
is more than probabl to have serv under napoleonwel can you
expect for an instant that on accustom at the word of hi
command to rush fearlessli on the veri bayonet of hi foe will
scrupl more to drive a stiletto into the heart of on he know to be
hi person enemi than to slaughter hi fellowcreatur mere
becaus bidden to do so by on he is bound to obei besid on
requir the excit of be hate in the ey of the accus in
order to lash on self into a state of suffici vehem and
power i would not choos to see the man against whom i plead smile

why that is the veri worst offenc thei could possibl commit for
dont you see rene the king is the father of hi peopl and he who
shall plot or contriv aught against the life and safeti of the parent
of thirtytwo million of soul is a parricid upon a fearfulli great
scale
i dont know anyth about that repli rene but m de
villefort you have promis mehav you notalwai to show merci to

my love said the marquis attend to your dove your lapdog and
embroideri but do not meddl with what you do not understand nowadai
the militari profess is in abey and the magisteri robe is the

than warm decid prefer and convict have made thi
wellturn speech villefort look carefulli around to mark the
effect of hi oratori much as he would have done had he been
address the bench in open court

exactli what i myself said the other dai at the tuileri when
question by hi majesti princip chamberlain touch the
singular of an allianc between the son of a girondin and the
daughter of an offic of the duc de cond and i assur you he seem
fulli to comprehend that thi mode of reconcil polit differ
wa base upon sound and excel principl then the king who
without our suspect it had overheard our convers interrupt
us by sai villefortobserv that the king did not pronounc the
word noirtier but on the contrari place consider emphasi on
that of villefortvillefort said hi majesti is a young man of
great judgment and discret who will be sure to make a figur in hi
profess i like him much and it gave me great pleasur to hear that
he wa about to becom the soninlaw of the marqui and marquis de

chapter 8 the chteau dif
the commissari of polic as he travers the antechamb made a sign
to two gendarm who place themselv on on dant right and the
other on hi left a door that commun with the palai de justic
wa open and thei went through a long rang of gloomi corridor
whose appear might have made even the boldest shudder the palai
de justic commun with the prisona sombr edific that from
it grate window look on the clocktow of the accoul after
numberless wind dant saw a door with an iron wicket the
commissari took up an iron mallet and knock thrice everi blow
seem to dant as if struck on hi heart the door open the two
gendarm gentli push him forward and the door close with a loud
sound behind him the air he inhal wa no longer pure but thick and
mephitich wa in prison
he wa conduct to a toler neat chamber but grate and bar
and it appear therefor did not greatli alarm him besid the
word of villefort who seem to interest himself so much resound
still in hi ear like a promis of freedom it wa four oclock when
dant wa place in thi chamber it wa as we have said the 1st of
march and the prison wa soon buri in dark the obscur
augment the acut of hi hear at the slightest sound he rose
and hasten to the door convinc thei were about to liber him
but the sound di awai and dant sank again into hi seat at last
about ten oclock and just as dant began to despair step were
heard in the corridor a kei turn in the lock the bolt creak the
massi oaken door flew open and a flood of light from two torch
pervad the apart
by the torchlight dant saw the glitter sabr and carbin of four
gendarm he had advanc at first but stop at the sight of thi
displai of forc
ar you come to fetch me ask he
ye repli a gendarm
by the order of the deputi procureur
i believ so the convict that thei came from m de villefort
reliev all dant apprehens he advanc calmli and place
himself in the centr of the escort a carriag wait at the door the
coachman wa on the box and a polic offic sat besid him
is thi carriag for me said dant
it is for you repli a gendarm
dant wa about to speak but feel himself urg forward and
have neither the power nor the intent to resist he mount the
step and wa in an instant seat insid between two gendarm the
two other took their place opposit and the carriag roll heavili
over the stone
the prison glanc at the windowsthei were grate he had chang
hi prison for anoth that wa convei him he knew not whither
through the grate howev dant saw thei were pass through the
rue caisseri and by the rue saintlaur and the rue tarami to the
quai soon he saw the light of la consign
the carriag stop the offic descend approach the guardhous
a dozen soldier came out and form themselv in order dant saw
the reflect of their musket by the light of the lamp on the quai
can all thi forc be summon on my account thought he
the offic open the door which wa lock and without speak a
word answer dant question for he saw between the rank of the
soldier a passag form from the carriag to the port the two
gendarm who were opposit to him descend first then he wa order
to alight and the gendarm on each side of him follow hi exampl
thei advanc toward a boat which a customhous offic held by a
chain near the quai
the soldier look at dant with an air of stupid curios in an
instant he wa place in the sternsheet of the boat between the
gendarm while the offic station himself at the bow a shove sent
the boat adrift and four sturdi oarsmen impel it rapidli toward
the pilon at a shout from the boat the chain that close the mouth of
the port wa lower and in a second thei were as dant knew in the
frioul and outsid the inner harbor
the prison first feel wa of joi at again breath the pure
airfor air is freedom but he soon sigh for he pass befor la
rserv where he had that morn been so happi and now through the
open window came the laughter and revelri of a ball dant fold hi
hand rais hi ey to heaven and prai fervent
0111m
the boat continu her voyag thei had pass the tte de mort were
now off the ans du pharo and about to doubl the batteri thi
manuvr wa incomprehens to dant
whither ar you take me ask he
you will soon know
but still
we ar forbidden to give you ani explan dant train in
disciplin knew that noth would be more absurd than to question
subordin who were forbidden to repli and so he remain silent
the most vagu and wild thought pass through hi mind the boat thei
were in could not make a long voyag there wa no vessel at anchor
outsid the harbor he thought perhap thei were go to leav him
on some distant point he wa not bound nor had thei made ani attempt
to handcuff him thi seem a good auguri besid had not the
deputi who had been so kind to him told him that provid he did not
pronounc the dread name of noirtier he had noth to apprehend
had not villefort in hi presenc destroi the fatal letter the onli
proof against him
he wait silent strive to pierc through the dark
thei had left the il ratonneau where the lighthous stood on the
right and were now opposit the point de catalan it seem to the
prison that he could distinguish a feminin form on the beach for it
wa there mercd dwelt how wa it that a presenti did not warn
mercd that her lover wa within three hundr yard of her
on light alon wa visibl and dant saw that it came from mercd
chamber mercd wa the onli on awak in the whole settlement a
loud cry could be heard by her but pride restrain him and he did not
utter it what would hi guard think if thei heard him shout like a
madman
he remain silent hi ey fix upon the light the boat went on
but the prison thought onli of mercd an interven elev of
land hid the light dant turn and perceiv that thei had got out
to sea while he had been absorb in thought thei had ship their
oar and hoist sail the boat wa now move with the wind
in spite of hi repugn to address the guard dant turn to the
nearest gendarm and take hi hand
comrad said he i adjur you as a christian and a soldier to
tell me where we ar go i am captain dant a loyal frenchman
thought accus of treason tell me where you ar conduct me and i
promis you on my honor i will submit to my fate
the gendarm look irresolut at hi companion who return for
answer a sign that said i see no great harm in tell him now and
the gendarm repli
you ar a nativ of marseil and a sailor and yet you do not know
where you ar go
on my honor i have no idea
have you no idea whatev
none at all
that is imposs
i swear to you it is true tell me i entreat
but my order
your order do not forbid your tell me what i must know in ten
minut in half an hour or an hour you see i cannot escap even if
i intend
unless you ar blind or have never been outsid the harbor you must
know
i do not
look round you then dant rose and look forward when he saw rise
within a hundr yard of him the black and frown rock on which
stand the chteau dif thi gloomi fortress which ha for more than
three hundr year furnish food for so mani wild legend seem to
dant like a scaffold to a malefactor
the chteau dif cri he what ar we go there for
the gendarm smile
i am not go there to be imprison said dant it is onli us
for polit prison i have commit no crime ar there ani
magistr or judg at the chteau dif
there ar onli said the gendarm a governor a garrison turnkei
and good thick wall come come do not look so astonish or you
will make me think you ar laugh at me in return for my good
natur
dant press the gendarm hand as though he would crush it
you think then said he that i am taken to the chteau dif to be
imprison there
it is probabl but there is no occas to squeez so hard
without ani inquiri without ani formal
all the formal have been gone through the inquiri is alreadi
made
and so in spite of m de villefort promis
i do not know what m de villefort promis you said the gendarm
but i know we ar take you to the chteau dif but what ar you
do help comrad help
by a rapid movement which the gendarm practic ey had perceiv
dant sprang forward to precipit himself into the sea but four
vigor arm seiz him as hi feet quit the bottom of the boat he
fell back curs with rage
good said the gendarm place hi knee on hi chest thi is the
wai you keep your word as a sailor believ softspoken gentlemen
again hark ye my friend i have disobei my first order but i will
not disobei the second and if you move i will blow your brain out
and he level hi carbin at dant who felt the muzzl against hi
templ
for a moment the idea of struggl cross hi mind and of so end
the unexpect evil that had overtaken him but he bethought him of m
de villefort promis and besid death in a boat from the hand of
a gendarm seem too terribl he remain motionless but gnash
hi teeth and wring hi hand with furi
at thi moment the boat came to a land with a violent shock on of
the sailor leap on shore a cord creak as it ran through a pullei
and dant guess thei were at the end of the voyag and that thei
were moor the boat
hi guard take him by the arm and coatcollar forc him to rise
and drag him toward the step that lead to the gate of the
fortress while the polic offic carri a musket with fix bayonet
follow behind
dant made no resist he wa like a man in a dream he saw
soldier drawn up on the embank he knew vagu that he wa
ascend a flight of step he wa consciou that he pass through a
door and that the door close behind him but all thi indistinctli as
through a mist he did not even see the ocean that terribl barrier
against freedom which the prison look upon with utter despair
thei halt for a minut dure which he strove to collect hi
thought he look around he wa in a court surround by high wall
he heard the measur tread of sentinel and as thei pass befor the
light he saw the barrel of their musket shine
thei wait upward of ten minut certain dant could not escap
the gendarm releas him thei seem await order the order
came
where is the prison said a voic
here repli the gendarm
let him follow me i will take him to hi cell
go said the gendarm thrust dant forward
the prison follow hi guid who led him into a room almost under
ground whose bare and reek wall seem as though impregn with
tear a lamp place on a stool illumin the apart faintli and
show dant the featur of hi conductor an underjail

the jailer shrug hi shoulder and left the chamber
dant follow him with hi ey and stretch forth hi hand
toward the open door but the door close all hi emot then burst
forth he cast himself on the ground weep bitterli and ask
himself what crime he had commit that he wa thu punish
the dai pass thu he scarc tast food but walk round and
round the cell like a wild beast in it cage on thought in particular

subdu tone

villefort hastili quit the apart but reflect that the sight
of the deputi procureur run through the street would be enough to
throw the whole citi into confus he resum hi ordinari pace at
hi door he perceiv a figur in the shadow that seem to wait for
him it wa mercd who hear no new of her lover had come
unobserv to inquir after him
as villefort drew near she advanc and stood befor him dant had
spoken of mercd and villefort instantli recogn her her beauti
and high bear surpris him and when she inquir what had becom
of her lover it seem to him that she wa the judg and he the
accus
the young man you speak of said villefort abruptli is a great
crimin and i can do noth for him mademoisel mercd burst
into tear and as villefort strove to pass her again address him
but at least tell me where he is that i mai know whether he is
aliv or dead said she
0125m
i do not know he is no longer in my hand repli villefort
and desir of put an end to the interview he push by her and
close the door as if to exclud the pain he felt but remors is not
thu banish like virgil wound hero he carri the arrow in hi
wound and arriv at the salon villefort utter a sigh that wa
almost a sob and sank into a chair
then the first pang of an unend tortur seiz upon hi heart the
man he sacrif to hi ambit that innoc victim immol on
the altar of hi father fault appear to him pale and threaten
lead hi affianc bride by the hand and bring with him remors
not such as the ancient figur furiou and terribl but that slow
and consum agoni whose pang ar intensifi from hour to hour up to
the veri moment of death then he had a moment hesit he had
frequent call for capit punish on crimin and ow to hi
irresist eloqu thei had been condemn and yet the slightest
shadow of remors had never cloud villefort brow becaus thei were
guilti at least he believ so but here wa an innoc man whose
happi he had destroi in thi case he wa not the judg but the
execution
as he thu reflect he felt the sensat we have describ and
which had hitherto been unknown to him aris in hi bosom and fill
him with vagu apprehens it is thu that a wound man trembl
instinct at the approach of the finger to hi wound until it be
heal but villefort wa on of those that never close or if thei
do onli close to reopen more agon than ever if at thi moment
the sweet voic of rene had sound in hi ear plead for merci or
the fair mercd had enter and said in the name of god i conjur
you to restor me my affianc husband hi cold and trembl hand
would have sign hi releas but no voic broke the still of the
chamber and the door wa open onli by villefort valet who came to

consid the disclosur of m de villefort insignific or els
dictat by venal ambit these word were an allus to the
sentiment which the minist of polic had utter with so much
confid an hour befor
villefort understood the king intent ani other person would
perhap have been overcom by such an intox draught of prais
but he fear to make for himself a mortal enemi of the polic
minist although he saw that dandr wa irrevoc lost in fact
the minist who in the plenitud of hi power had been unabl to
unearth napoleon secret might in despair at hi own downfal
interrog dant and so lai bare the motiv of villefort plot

you to protect me
i do better than that siri save you

ye that the usual phrase i am quit familiar with it when the
polic is at fault it declar that it is on the track and the
govern patient await the dai when it come to sai with a
sneak air that the track is lost
ye but thei have found a corps the gener ha been kill and in
all countri thei call that a murder

gener wa murder peopl ar found everi dai in the sein have
thrown themselv in or have been drown from not know how to

himself in despair and peopl do not bath in the sein in the month

the king himself
the king i thought he wa philosoph enough to allow that there wa
no murder in polit in polit my dear fellow you know as well

perhap

prophet of evil ar not in favor at the court father
true but some dai thei do them justic and suppos a second
restor you would then pass for a great man

noirtier left the room when he had finish with the same calm
that had character him dure the whole of thi remark and
try convers villefort pale and agit ran to the window
put asid the curtain and saw him pass cool and collect by two or
three illlook men at the corner of the street who were there
perhap to arrest a man with black whisker and a blue frockcoat
and hat with broad brim
villefort stood watch breathless until hi father had disappear
at the rue bussi then he turn to the variou articl he had left
behind him put the black cravat and blue frockcoat at the bottom of
the portmanteau threw the hat into a dark closet broke the cane into
small bit and flung it in the fire put on hi travellingcap and
call hi valet check with a look the thousand question he wa
readi to ask paid hi bill sprang into hi carriag which wa readi
learn at lyon that bonapart had enter grenobl and in the midst
of the tumult which prevail along the road at length reach
marseil a prei to all the hope and fear which enter into the
heart of man with ambit and it first success
chapter 13 the hundr dai
m noirtier wa a true prophet and thing progress rapidli as he
had predict everyon know the histori of the famou return from
elba a return which wa unpreced in the past and will probabl
remain without a counterpart in the futur
loui xviii made but a faint attempt to parri thi unexpect blow
the monarchi he had scarc reconstruct totter on it precari
foundat and at a sign from the emperor the incongru structur of
ancient prejudic and new idea fell to the ground villefort
therefor gain noth save the king gratitud which wa rather
like to injur him at the present time and the cross of the legion
of honor which he had the prudenc not to wear although m de blaca
had duli forward the brevet
napoleon would doubtless have depriv villefort of hi offic had it
not been for noirtier who wa all power at court and thu the
girondin of 93 and the senat of 1806 protect him who so late had
been hi protector all villefort influenc bare enabl him to
stifl the secret dant had so nearli divulg the king procureur
alon wa depriv of hi offic be suspect of royal
howev scarc wa the imperi power establishedthat is scarc
had the emperor reenter the tuileri and begun to issu order from
the closet into which we have introduc our readersh found on the
tabl there loui xviii halffil snuffboxscarc had thi
occur when marseil began in spite of the author to
rekindl the flame of civil war alwai smoulder in the south and
it requir but littl to excit the populac to act of far greater
violenc than the shout and insult with which thei assail the
royalist whenev thei ventur abroad
0159m
ow to thi chang the worthi shipown becam at that momentw
will not sai all power becaus morrel wa a prudent and rather a
timid man so much so that mani of the most zealou partisan of
bonapart accus him of moderationbut suffici influenti to
make a demand in favor of dant
villefort retain hi place but hi marriag wa put off until a more
favor opportun if the emperor remain on the throne grard
requir a differ allianc to aid hi career if loui xviii
return the influenc of m de saintmran like hi own could be
vastli increas and the marriag be still more suitabl the deputi
procureur wa therefor the first magistr of marseil when on
morn hi door open and m morrel wa announc
anyon els would have hasten to receiv him but villefort wa a man
of abil and he knew thi would be a sign of weak he made
morrel wait in the antechamb although he had no on with him for
the simpl reason that the king procureur alwai make everyon wait
and after pass a quarter of an hour in read the paper he
order m morrel to be admit
morrel expect villefort would be deject he found him as he had
found him six week befor calm firm and full of that glacial
polit that most insurmount barrier which separ the
wellbr from the vulgar man
he had enter villefort offic expect that the magistr would
trembl at the sight of him on the contrari he felt a cold shudder
all over him when he saw villefort sit there with hi elbow on hi
desk and hi head lean on hi hand he stop at the door
villefort gaze at him as if he had some difficulti in recogn him
then after a brief interv dure which the honest shipown turn
hi hat in hi hand
m morrel i believ said villefort
ye sir
come nearer said the magistr with a patron wave of the
hand and tell me to what circumst i ow the honor of thi visit
do you not guess monsieur ask morrel
not in the least but if i can serv you in ani wai i shall be
delight
everyth depend on you
explain yourself prai
monsieur said morrel recov hi assur as he proceed do
you recollect that a few dai befor the land of hi majesti the
emperor i came to interced for a young man the mate of my ship who
wa accus of be concern in correspond with the island of
elba what wa the other dai a crime is todai a titl to favor you
then serv loui xviii and you did not show ani favorit wa your
duti todai you serv napoleon and you ought to protect himit is
equal your duti i come therefor to ask what ha becom of him
0161m
villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself what is hi
name said he tell me hi name
edmond dant
villefort would probabl have rather stood opposit the muzzl of a
pistol at fiveandtwenti pace than have heard thi name spoken but
he did not blanch
dant repeat he edmond dant
ye monsieur villefort open a larg regist then went to a
tabl from the tabl turn to hi regist and then turn to
morrel
ar you quit sure you ar not mistaken monsieur said he in the
most natur tone in the world
had morrel been a more quicksight man or better vers in these
matter he would have been surpris at the king procureur answer
him on such a subject instead of refer him to the governor of the
prison or the prefect of the depart but morrel disappoint in
hi expect of excit fear wa consciou onli of the other
condescens villefort had calcul rightli
no said morrel i am not mistaken i have known him for ten year
the last four of which he wa in my servic do not you recollect i
came about six week ago to plead for clemenc as i come todai to
plead for justic you receiv me veri coldli oh the royalist were
veri sever with the bonapartist in those dai
monsieur return villefort i wa then a royalist becaus i
believ the bourbon not onli the heir to the throne but the chosen
of the nation the miracul return of napoleon ha conquer me the
legitim monarch is he who is love by hi peopl
that right cri morrel i like to hear you speak thu and i
augur well for edmond from it
wait a moment said villefort turn over the leav of a regist
i have ita sailor who wa about to marri a young catalan girl i
recollect now it wa a veri seriou charg
how so
you know that when he left here he wa taken to the palai de
justic
well
i made my report to the author at pari and a week after he wa
carri off
carri off said morrel what can thei have done with him
oh he ha been taken to fenestrel to pignerol or to the
saintemargurit island some fine morn he will return to take
command of your vessel
come when he will it shall be kept for him but how is it he is not
alreadi return it seem to me the first care of govern should be
to set at liberti those who have suffer for their adher to it
do not be too hasti m morrel repli villefort the order of
imprison came from high author and the order for hi liber
must proce from the same sourc and as napoleon ha scarc been
reinstat a fortnight the letter have not yet been forward
but said morrel is there no wai of expedit all these
formalitiesof releas him from arrest
there ha been no arrest
how
it is sometim essenti to govern to caus a man disappear
without leav ani trace so that no written form or document mai
defeat their wish
it might be so under the bourbon but at present
it ha alwai been so my dear morrel sinc the reign of loui xiv
the emperor is more strict in prison disciplin than even loui
himself and the number of prison whose name ar not on the
regist is incalcul had morrel even ani suspicion so much
kind would have dispel them
well m de villefort how would you advis me to act ask he
petit the minist
oh i know what that is the minist receiv two hundr petit
everi dai and doe not read three
that is true but he will read a petit countersign and present
by me
and will you undertak to deliv it
with the greatest pleasur dant wa then guilti and now he is
innoc and it is as much my duti to free him as it wa to condemn
him villefort thu forestal ani danger of an inquiri which
howev improb it might be if it did take place would leav him
defenceless
but how shall i address the minist
sit down there said villefort give up hi place to morrel and
write what i dictat
will you be so good
certainli but lose no time we have lost too much alreadi
that is true onli think what the poor fellow mai even now be
suffer
villefort shudder at the suggest but he had gone too far to draw
back dant must be crush to gratifi villefort ambit
villefort dictat a petit in which from an excel intent
no doubt dant patriot servic were exagger and he wa made
out on of the most activ agent of napoleon return it wa evid
that at the sight of thi document the minist would instantli releas
him the petit finish villefort read it aloud
that will do said he leav the rest to me
will the petit go soon
todai
countersign by you
the best thing i can do will be to certifi the truth of the content
of your petit and sit down villefort wrote the certif
at the bottom
what more is to be done
i will do whatev is necessari thi assur delight morrel who
took leav of villefort and hasten to announc to old dant that he
would soon see hi son
as for villefort instead of send to pari he carefulli preserv
the petit that so fearfulli compromis dant in the hope of an
event that seem not unlikelythat is a second restor dant
remain a prison and heard not the nois of the fall of loui
xviii throne or the still more tragic destruct of the empir
twice dure the hundr dai had morrel renew hi demand and twice
had villefort sooth him with promis at last there wa waterloo
and morrel came no more he had done all that wa in hi power and ani
fresh attempt would onli compromis himself uselessli
loui xviii remount the throne villefort to whom marseil had
becom fill with remors memori sought and obtain the
situat of king procureur at toulous and a fortnight afterward
he marri mademoisel de saintmran whose father now stood higher
at court than ever
and so dant after the hundr dai and after waterloo remain in
hi dungeon forgotten of earth and heaven
danglar comprehend the full extent of the wretch fate that
overwhelm dant and when napoleon return to franc he after
the manner of mediocr mind term the coincid a decre of
provid but when napoleon return to pari danglar heart
fail him and he live in constant fear of dant return on a
mission of vengeanc he therefor inform m morrel of hi wish to
quit the sea and obtain a recommend from him to a spanish
merchant into whose servic he enter at the end of march that is
ten or twelv dai after napoleon return he then left for madrid
and wa no more heard of
fernand understood noth except that dant wa absent what had
becom of him he care not to inquir onli dure the respit the
absenc of hi rival afford him he reflect partli on the mean of
deceiv mercd as to the caus of hi absenc partli on plan of
emigr and abduct as from time to time he sat sad and
motionless on the summit of cape pharo at the spot from whenc
marseil and the catalan ar visibl watch for the apparit of
a young and handsom man who wa for him also the messeng of
vengeanc fernand mind wa made up he would shoot dant and then
kill himself but fernand wa mistaken a man of hi disposit never
kill himself for he constantli hope
dure thi time the empir made it last conscript and everi man
in franc capabl of bear arm rush to obei the summon of the
emperor fernand depart with the rest bear with him the terribl
thought that while he wa awai hi rival would perhap return and
marri mercd had fernand realli meant to kill himself he would have
done so when he part from mercd hi devot and the compass
he show for her misfortun produc the effect thei alwai produc
on nobl mindsmercd had alwai had a sincer regard for fernand
and thi wa now strengthen by gratitud
my brother said she as she place hi knapsack on hi shoulder
be care of yourself for if you ar kill i shall be alon in the
world these word carri a rai of hope into fernand heart should
dant not return mercd might on dai be hi

mercd wa left alon face to face with the vast plain that had never
seem so barren and the sea that had never seem so vast bath in
tear she wander about the catalan villag sometim she stood mute
and motionless as a statu look toward marseil at other time
gaze on the sea and debat as to whether it were not better to
cast herself into the abyss of the ocean and thu end her woe it wa
not want of courag that prevent her put thi resolut into
execut but her religi feel came to her aid and save her
caderouss wa like fernand enrol in the armi but be marri
and eight year older he wa mere sent to the frontier old dant
who wa onli sustain by hope lost all hope at napoleon downfal
five month after he had been separ from hi son and almost at the
hour of hi arrest he breath hi last in mercd arm m morrel

man had contract
there wa more than benevol in thi action there wa courag the
south wa aflam and to assist even on hi deathb the father of

time restrain by the limit of mere probabl have neither
courag nor desir thei fear the ear that hear their order and the
ey that scrutin their action formerli thei believ themselv
sprung from jupit and shield by their birth but nowadai thei ar
not inviol
it ha alwai been against the polici of despot govern to suffer
the victim of their persecut to reappear as the inquisit
rare allow it victim to be seen with their limb distort and
their flesh lacer by tortur so mad is alwai conceal in it
cell from whenc should it depart it is convei to some gloomi
hospit where the doctor ha no thought for man or mind in the
mutil be the jailer deliv to him the veri mad of the
abb faria gone mad in prison condemn him to perpetu captiv
the inspector kept hi word with dant he examin the regist and
found the follow note concern him
edmond dant
violent bonapartist took an activ part in the return from elba
the greatest watch and care to be exercis
thi note wa in a differ hand from the rest which show that it
had been ad sinc hi confin the inspector could not contend
against thi accus he simpli wrote noth to be done
thi visit had infus new vigor into dant he had till then
forgotten the date but now with a fragment of plaster he wrote the
date 30th juli 1816 and made a mark everi dai in order not to lose
hi reckon again dai and week pass awai then monthsdant
still wait he at first expect to be freed in a fortnight thi
fortnight expir he decid that the inspector would do noth until
hi return to pari and that he would not reach there until hi
circuit wa finish he therefor fix three month three month
pass awai then six more final ten month and a half had gone by
and no favor chang had taken place and dant began to fanci the
inspector visit but a dream an illus of the brain
at the expir of a year the governor wa transfer he had
obtain charg of the fortress at ham he took with him sever of hi
subordin and amongst them dant jailer a new governor arriv
it would have been too tediou to acquir the name of the prison
he learn their number instead thi horribl place contain fifti
cell their inhabit were design by the number of their cell
and the unhappi young man wa no longer call edmond dantsh wa now
number 34
chapter 15 number 34 and number 27
dant pass through all the stage of tortur natur to prison in
suspens he wa sustain at first by that pride of consciou
innoc which is the sequenc to hope then he began to doubt hi own
innoc which justifi in some measur the governor belief in hi
mental alien and then relax hi sentiment of pride he
address hi supplic not to god but to man god is alwai the
last resourc unfortun who ought to begin with god do not have
ani hope in him till thei have exhaust all other mean of
deliver
dant ask to be remov from hi present dungeon into anoth even
if it were darker and deeper for a chang howev disadvantag
wa still a chang and would afford him some amus he entreat
to be allow to walk about to have fresh air book and write
materi hi request were not grant but he went on ask all the
same he accustom himself to speak to the new jailer although the
latter wa if possibl more taciturn than the old on but still to
speak to a man even though mute wa someth dant spoke for the
sake of hear hi own voic he had tri to speak when alon but
the sound of hi voic terrifi him
often befor hi captiv dant mind had revolt at the idea of
assemblag of prison made up of thiev vagabond and murder
he now wish to be amongst them in order to see some other face
besid that of hi jailer he sigh for the gallei with the
infam costum the chain and the brand on the shoulder the
galleyslav breath the fresh air of heaven and saw each other
thei were veri happi
he besought the jailer on dai to let him have a companion were it
even the mad abb the jailer though rough and harden by the
constant sight of so much suffer wa yet a man at the bottom of
hi heart he had often had a feel of piti for thi unhappi young man
who suffer so and he laid the request of number 34 befor the
governor but the latter sapient imagin that dant wish to
conspir or attempt an escap and refus hi request dant had
exhaust all human resourc and he then turn to god
all the piou idea that had been so long forgotten return he
recollect the prayer hi mother had taught him and discov a new
mean in everi word for in prosper prayer seem but a mere medlei
of word until misfortun come and the unhappi suffer first
understand the mean of the sublim languag in which he invok the
piti of heaven he prai and prai aloud no longer terrifi at the
sound of hi own voic for he fell into a sort of ecstasi he laid
everi action of hi life befor the almighti propos task to
accomplish and at the end of everi prayer introduc the entreati
often address to man than to god forgiv us our trespass as we
forgiv them that trespass against us yet in spite of hi earnest
prayer dant remain a prison
then gloom settl heavili upon him dant wa a man of great
simplic of thought and without educ he could not therefor
in the solitud of hi dungeon travers in mental vision the histori
of the ag bring to life the nation that had perish and rebuild
the ancient citi so vast and stupend in the light of the
imagin and that pass befor the ey glow with celesti color
in martin babylonian pictur he could not do thi he whose past
life wa so short whose present so melancholi and hi futur so
doubt nineteen year of light to reflect upon in etern dark
no distract could come to hi aid hi energet spirit that would
have exalt in thu revisit the past wa imprison like an eagl
in a cage he clung to on ideathat of hi happi destroi
without appar caus by an unheardof fatal he consid and
reconsid thi idea devour it so to speak as the implac
ugolino devour the skull of archbishop roger in the inferno of dant
rage supplant religi fervor dant utter blasphemi that made
hi jailer recoil with horror dash himself furious against the
wall of hi prison wreak hi anger upon everyth and chiefli
upon himself so that the least thinga grain of sand a straw or a
breath of air that annoi him led to paroxysm of furi then the
letter that villefort had show to him recur to hi mind and everi
line gleam forth in fieri letter on the wall like the mene mene
tekel upharsin of belshazzar he told himself that it wa the enmiti
of man and not the vengeanc of heaven that had thu plung him into
the deepest miseri he consign hi unknown persecutor to the most
horribl tortur he could imagin and found them all insuffici
becaus after tortur came death and after death if not repos at
least the boon of unconsci
by dint of constantli dwell on the idea that tranquil wa death
and if punish were the end in view other tortur than death must
be invent he began to reflect on suicid unhappi he who on the
brink of misfortun brood over idea like these
befor him is a dead sea that stretch in azur calm befor the ey
but he who unwarili ventur within it embrac find himself
struggl with a monster that would drag him down to perdit onc
thu ensnar unless the protect hand of god snatch him thenc all
is over and hi struggl but tend to hasten hi destruct thi
state of mental anguish is howev less terribl than the suffer
that preced or the punish that possibl will follow there is a
sort of consol at the contempl of the yawn abyss at the
bottom of which lie dark and obscur
edmond found some solac in these idea all hi sorrow all hi
suffer with their train of gloomi spectr fled from hi cell
when the angel of death seem about to enter dant review hi past
life with composur and look forward with terror to hi futur
exist chose that middl line that seem to afford him a refug
sometim said he in my voyag when i wa a man and command
other men i have seen the heaven overcast the sea rage and foam the
storm aris and like a monstrou bird beat the two horizon with
it wing then i felt that my vessel wa a vain refug that trembl
and shook befor the tempest soon the furi of the wave and the sight
of the sharp rock announc the approach of death and death then
terrifi me and i us all my skill and intellig as a man and a
sailor to struggl against the wrath of god but i did so becaus i wa
happi becaus i had not court death becaus to be cast upon a bed
of rock and seawe seem terribl becaus i wa unwil that i a
creatur made for the servic of god should serv for food to the
gull and raven but now it is differ i have lost all that bound
me to life death smile and invit me to repos i die after my own
manner i die exhaust and brokenspirit as i fall asleep when i
have pace three thousand time round my cellthat is thirti thousand
step or about ten leagu
no sooner had thi idea taken possess of him than he becam more
compos arrang hi couch to the best of hi power at littl and
slept less and found exist almost support becaus he felt
that he could throw it off at pleasur like a wornout garment two
method of selfdestruct were at hi dispos he could hang himself
with hi handkerchief to the window bar or refus food and die of
starvat but the first wa repugn to him dant had alwai
entertain the greatest horror of pirat who ar hung up to the
yardarm he would not die by what seem an infam death he
resolv to adopt the second and began that dai to carri out hi
resolv
0185m
nearli four year had pass awai at the end of the second he had
ceas to mark the laps of time dant said i wish to die and had
chosen the manner of hi death and fear of chang hi mind he
had taken an oath to die when my morn and even meal ar
brought thought he i will cast them out of the window and thei
will think that i have eaten them
he kept hi word twice a dai he cast out through the bar apertur
the provis hi jailer brought himat first gayli then with
deliber and at last with regret noth but the recollect of
hi oath gave him strength to proce hunger made viand onc
repugn now accept he held the plate in hi hand for an hour at
a time and gaze thoughtfulli at the morsel of bad meat of taint
fish of black and mouldi bread it wa the last yearn for life
contend with the resolut of despair then hi dungeon seem less
sombr hi prospect less desper he wa still youngh wa onli
four or fiveandtwentyh had nearli fifti year to live what
unforseen event might not open hi prison door and restor him to
liberti then he rais to hi lip the repast that like a voluntari
tantalu he refus himself but he thought of hi oath and he would
not break it he persist until at last he had not suffici
strength to rise and cast hi supper out of the loophol the next
morn he could not see or hear the jailer fear he wa danger
ill edmond hope he wa dy
thu the dai pass awai edmond felt a sort of stupor creep over
him which brought with it a feel almost of content the gnaw pain
at hi stomach had ceas hi thirst had abat when he close hi
ey he saw myriad of light danc befor them like the
willothewisp that plai about the marsh it wa the twilight of
that mysteri countri call death
suddenli about nine oclock in the even edmond heard a hollow
sound in the wall against which he wa ly
so mani loathsom anim inhabit the prison that their nois did
not in gener awak him but whether abstin had quicken hi
faculti or whether the nois wa realli louder than usual edmond
rais hi head and listen it wa a continu scratch as if made
by a huge claw a power tooth or some iron instrument attack the
stone
although weaken the young man brain instantli respond to the
idea that haunt all prisonersliberti it seem to him that heaven
had at length taken piti on him and had sent thi nois to warn him on
the veri brink of the abyss perhap on of those belov on he had
so often thought of wa think of him and strive to diminish the
distanc that separ them
no no doubtless he wa deceiv and it wa but on of those dream
that forerun death
edmond still heard the sound it last nearli three hour he then
heard a nois of someth fall and all wa silent
some hour afterward it began again nearer and more distinct edmond
wa intens interest suddenli the jailer enter
for a week sinc he had resolv to die and dure the four dai that
he had been carri out hi purpos edmond had not spoken to the
attend had not answer him when he inquir what wa the matter
with him and turn hi face to the wall when he look too curious
at him but now the jailer might hear the nois and put an end to it
and so destroi a rai of someth like hope that sooth hi last
moment
the jailer brought him hi breakfast dant rais himself up and
began to talk about everyth about the bad qualiti of the food
about the cold of hi dungeon grumbl and complain in order
to have an excus for speak louder and weari the patienc of hi
jailer who out of kind of heart had brought broth and white bread
for hi prison
fortun he fanci that dant wa deliri and place the food
on the ricketi tabl he withdrew edmond listen and the sound
becam more and more distinct
there can be no doubt about it thought he it is some prison who
is strive to obtain hi freedom oh if i were onli there to help
him
suddenli anoth idea took possess of hi mind so us to
misfortun that it wa scarc capabl of hopeth idea that the
nois wa made by workmen the governor had order to repair the
neighbor dungeon
it wa easi to ascertain thi but how could he risk the question it
wa easi to call hi jailer attent to the nois and watch hi
counten as he listen but might he not by thi mean destroi
hope far more import than the shortliv satisfact of hi own
curios unfortun edmond brain wa still so feebl that he
could not bend hi thought to anyth in particular he saw but on
mean of restor lucid and clear to hi judgment he turn
hi ey toward the soup which the jailer had brought rose stagger
toward it rais the vessel to hi lip and drank off the content
with a feel of indescrib pleasur
he had the resolut to stop with thi he had often heard that
shipwreck person had di through have eagerli devour too much
food edmond replac on the tabl the bread he wa about to devour
and return to hi couchh did not wish to die he soon felt that hi
idea becam again collectedh could think and strengthen hi
thought by reason then he said to himself
i must put thi to the test but without compromis anybodi if it
is a workman i need but knock against the wall and he will ceas to
work in order to find out who is knock and why he doe so but as
hi occup is sanction by the governor he will soon resum it
if on the contrari it is a prison the nois i make will alarm him
he will ceas and not begin again until he think everyon is asleep
edmond rose again but thi time hi leg did not trembl and hi
sight wa clear he went to a corner of hi dungeon detach a stone
and with it knock against the wall where the sound came he struck
thrice
at the first blow the sound ceas as if by magic
edmond listen intent an hour pass two hour pass and no
sound wa heard from the wallal wa silent there
full of hope edmond swallow a few mouth of bread and water and
thank to the vigor of hi constitut found himself wellnigh
recov
the dai pass awai in utter silencenight came without recurr of
the nois
it is a prison said edmond joyfulli hi brain wa on fire and
life and energi return
the night pass in perfect silenc edmond did not close hi ey
in the morn the jailer brought him fresh provisionsh had alreadi
devour those of the previou dai he at these listen anxious
for the sound walk round and round hi cell shake the iron bar
of the loophol restor vigor and agil to hi limb by exercis
and so prepar himself for hi futur destini at interv he
listen to learn if the nois had not begun again and grew impati
at the prudenc of the prison who did not guess he had been
disturb by a captiv as anxiou for liberti as himself
three dai passedseventytwo long tediou hour which he count off
by minut
at length on even as the jailer wa visit him for the last time
that night dant with hi ear for the hundredth time at the wall
fanci he heard an almost impercept movement among the stone he
move awai walk up and down hi cell to collect hi thought and
then went back and listen
the matter wa no longer doubt someth wa at work on the other
side of the wall the prison had discov the danger and had
substitut a lever for a chisel
encourag by thi discoveri edmond determin to assist the
indefatig labor he began by move hi bed and look around
for anyth with which he could pierc the wall penetr the moist
cement and displac a stone
he saw noth he had no knife or sharp instrument the window grate
wa of iron but he had too often assur himself of it solid all
hi furnitur consist of a bed a chair a tabl a pail and a jug
the bed had iron clamp but thei were screw to the wood and it
would have requir a screwdriv to take them off the tabl and
chair had noth the pail had onc possess a handl but that had
been remov
0189m
dant had but on resourc which wa to break the jug and with on
of the sharp fragment attack the wall he let the jug fall on the
floor and it broke in piec
dant conceal two or three of the sharpest fragment in hi bed
leav the rest on the floor the break of hi jug wa too natur
an accid to excit suspicion edmond had all the night to work in

the damp had render it friabl and dant wa abl to break it
offin small morsel it is true but at the end of half an hour he had
scrape off a hand a mathematician might have calcul that in

these few word were utter with an accent that left no doubt of hi

precaut as befor and push hi bed back against the wall he then
gave himself up to hi happi he would no longer be alon he wa
perhap about to regain hi liberti at the worst he would have a
companion and captiv that is share is but half captiv plaint
made in common ar almost prayer and prayer where two or three ar
gather togeth invok the merci of heaven

hi bed press hi hand on hi heart at the slightest nois he
bound toward the door onc or twice the thought cross hi mind
that he might be separ from thi unknown whom he love alreadi
and then hi mind wa made upwhen the jailer move hi bed and stoop
to examin the open he would kill him with hi water jug he would
be condemn to die but he wa about to die of grief and despair when
thi miracul nois recal him to life
the jailer came in the even dant wa on hi bed it seem to him
that thu he better guard the unfinish open doubtless there wa
a strang express in hi ey for the jailer said come ar you
go mad again
dant did not answer he fear that the emot of hi voic would
betrai him the jailer went awai shake hi head night came dant
hope that hi neighbor would profit by the silenc to address him but
he wa mistaken the next morn howev just as he remov hi bed
from the wall he heard three knock he threw himself on hi knee
is it you said he i am here
is your jailer gone
ye said dant he will not return until the even so that we
have twelv hour befor us
i can work then said the voic
oh ye ye thi instant i entreat you
in a moment that part of the floor on which dant wa rest hi two
hand as he knelt with hi head in the open suddenli gave wai he
drew back smartli while a mass of stone and earth disappear in a
hole that open beneath the apertur he himself had form then from
the bottom of thi passag the depth of which it wa imposs to
measur he saw appear first the head then the shoulder and lastli
the bodi of a man who sprang lightli into hi cell

chapter 16 a learn italian
seiz in hi arm the friend so long and ardent desir dant
almost carri him toward the window in order to obtain a better view
of hi featur by the aid of the imperfect light that struggl
through the grate
he wa a man of small statur with hair blanch rather by suffer
and sorrow than by ag he had a deepset penetr ey almost
buri beneath the thick grai eyebrow and a long and still black
beard reach down to hi breast hi thin face deepli furrow by
care and the bold outlin of hi strongli mark featur betoken a
man more accustom to exercis hi mental faculti than hi physic
strength larg drop of perspir were now stand on hi brow
while the garment that hung about him were so rag that on could
onli guess at the pattern upon which thei had origin been
fashion
the stranger might have number sixti or sixtyf year but a
certain brisk and appear of vigor in hi movement made it
probabl that he wa ag more from captiv than the cours of time
he receiv the enthusiast greet of hi young acquaint with

invigor by hi contact with on so warm and ardent he thank him
with grate cordial for hi kindli welcom although he must at
that moment have been suffer bitterli to find anoth dungeon where

let us first see said he whether it is possibl to remov the
trace of my entranc hereour futur tranquil depend upon our
jailer be entir ignor of it
advanc to the open he stoop and rais the stone easili in
spite of it weight then fit it into it place he said
you remov thi stone veri carelessli but i suppos you had no tool
to aid you
why exclaim dant with astonish do you possess ani
i made myself some and with the except of a file i have all that
ar necessarya chisel pincer and lever
0201m
oh how i should like to see these product of your industri and
patienc
well in the first place here is my chisel
so sai he displai a sharp strong blade with a handl made of
beechwood
and with what did you contriv to make that inquir dant
with on of the clamp of my bedstead and thi veri tool ha suffic
me to hollow out the road by which i came hither a distanc of about
fifti feet
fifti feet respond dant almost terrifi
do not speak so loud young mandont speak so loud it frequent
occur in a state prison like thi that person ar station outsid
the door of the cell purpos to overhear the convers of the
prison
but thei believ i am shut up alon here
that make no differ
and you sai that you dug your wai a distanc of fifti feet to get
here
i do that is about the distanc that separ your chamber from
mine onli unfortun i did not curv aright for want of the
necessari geometr instrument to calcul my scale of proport
instead of take an ellipsi of forti feet i made it fifti i
expect as i told you to reach the outer wall pierc through it
and throw myself into the sea i have howev kept along the corridor
on which your chamber open instead of go beneath it my labor is
all in vain for i find that the corridor look into a courtyard fill
with soldier
that true said dant but the corridor you speak of onli bound
on side of my cell there ar three othersdo you know anyth of
their situat
thi on is built against the solid rock and it would take ten
experienc miner duli furnish with the requisit tool as mani
year to perfor it thi adjoin the lower part of the governor
apart and were we to work our wai through we should onli get
into some lockup cellar where we must necessarili be recaptur the
fourth and last side of your cell face onfac onstop a minut now
where doe it face
the wall of which he spoke wa the on in which wa fix the loophol
by which light wa admit to the chamber thi loophol which
gradual diminish in size as it approach the outsid to an
open through which a child could not have pass wa for better
secur furnish with three iron bar so as to quiet all
apprehens even in the mind of the most suspici jailer as to the
possibl of a prison escap as the stranger ask the question
he drag the tabl beneath the window
climb up said he to dant
the young man obei mount on the tabl and divin the wish of
hi companion place hi back secur against the wall and held out
both hand the stranger whom as yet dant knew onli by the number of
hi cell sprang up with an agil by no mean to be expect in a
person of hi year and light and steadi on hi feet as a cat or a
lizard climb from the tabl to the outstretch hand of dant and
from them to hi shoulder then bend doubl for the ceil of
the dungeon prevent him from hold himself erect he manag to
slip hi head between the upper bar of the window so as to be abl to
command a perfect view from top to bottom
an instant afterward he hastili drew back hi head sai i thought
so and slide from the shoulder of dant as dextrous as he had
ascend he nimbl leap from the tabl to the ground
what wa it that you thought ask the young man anxious in hi
turn descend from the tabl
the elder prison ponder the matter ye said he at length it
is so thi side of your chamber look out upon a kind of open galleri
where patrol ar continu pass and sentri keep watch dai and
night
ar you quit sure of that
certain i saw the soldier shape and the top of hi musket that
made me draw in my head so quickli for i wa fear he might also see
me
well inquir dant
you perceiv then the utter imposs of escap through your
dungeon
then pursu the young man eagerli
then answer the elder prison the will of god be done and as
the old man slowli pronounc those word an air of profound
resign spread itself over hi careworn counten dant gaze
on the man who could thu philosoph resign hope so long and
ardent nourish with an astonish mingl with admir
tell me i entreat of you who and what you ar said he at length
never have i met with so remark a person as yourself
willingli answer the stranger if inde you feel ani curios
respect on now ala powerless to aid you in ani wai
sai not so you can consol and support me by the strength of your own
power mind prai let me know who you realli ar
the stranger smile a melancholi smile then listen said he i am
the abb faria and have been imprison as you know in thi chteau
dif sinc the year 1811 previous to which i had been confin for
three year in the fortress of fenestrel in the year 1811 i wa
transfer to piedmont in franc it wa at thi period i learn that
the destini which seem subservi to everi wish form by napoleon
had bestow on him a son name king of rome even in hi cradl i wa
veri far then from expect the chang you have just inform me of

to abas the man onc so elev and rais up him who wa so abas
dant whole attent wa rivet on a man who could thu forget hi
own misfortun while occupi himself with the destini of other
ye ye continu he twill be the same as it wa in england
after charl i cromwel after cromwel charl ii and then jame
ii and then some soninlaw or relat some princ of orang a
stadthold who becom a king then new concess to the peopl
then a constitut then liberti ah my friend said the abb
turn toward dant and survei him with the kindl gaze of a
prophet you ar young you will see all thi come to pass
probabl if ever i get out of prison
true repli faria we ar prison but i forget thi sometim
and there ar even moment when my mental vision transport me beyond
these wall and i fanci myself at liberti
but wherefor ar you here
becaus in 1807 i dream of the veri plan napoleon tri to realiz
in 1811 becaus like machiavelli i desir to alter the polit
face of itali and instead of allow it to be split up into a
quantiti of petti princip each held by some weak or tyrann
ruler i sought to form on larg compact and power empir and
lastli becaus i fanci i had found my csar borgia in a crown
simpleton who feign to enter into my view onli to betrai me it wa
the plan of alexand vi and clement vii but it will never succe
now for thei attempt it fruitlessli and napoleon wa unabl to
complet hi work itali seem fate to misfortun and the old man
bow hi head
dant could not understand a man risk hi life for such matter
napoleon certainli he knew someth of inasmuch as he had seen and
spoken with him but of clement vii and alexand vi he knew noth
ar you not he ask the priest who here in the chteau dif is
gener thought to beill
mad you mean dont you
i did not like to sai so answer dant smile
well then resum faria with a bitter smile let me answer your
question in full by acknowledg that i am the poor mad prison of
the chteau dif for mani year permit to amus the differ
visitor with what is said to be my insan and in all probabl
i should be promot to the honor of make sport for the children if
such innoc be could be found in an abod devot like thi to
suffer and despair
dant remain for a short time mute and motionless at length he
said
then you abandon all hope of escap
i perceiv it utter imposs and i consid it impiou to
attempt that which the almighti evid doe not approv
nai be not discourag would it not be expect too much to hope to
succe at your first attempt why not try to find an open in
anoth direct from that which ha so unfortun fail
ala it show how littl notion you can have of all it ha cost me to
effect a purpos so unexpectedli frustrat that you talk of begin
over again in the first place i wa four year make the tool i
possess and have been two year scrape and dig out earth hard
as granit itself then what toil and fatigu ha it not been to remov
huge stone i should onc have deem imposs to loosen whole dai
have i pass in these titan effort consid my labor well
repaid if by nighttim i had contriv to carri awai a squar inch of
thi hardbound cement chang by ag into a substanc unyield as
the stone themselv then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish i
dug up i wa compel to break through a staircas and throw the
fruit of my labor into the hollow part of it but the well is now so
complet choke up that i scarc think it would be possibl to add
anoth hand of dust without lead to discoveri consid also
that i fulli believ i had accomplish the end and aim of my
undertak for which i had so exactli husband my strength as to
make it just hold out to the termin of my enterpris and now at
the moment when i reckon upon success my hope ar forev dash
from me no i repeat again that noth shall induc me to renew
attempt evid at varianc with the almighti pleasur
dant held down hi head that the other might not see how joi at the
thought of have a companion outweigh the sympathi he felt for the
failur of the abb plan
the abb sank upon edmond bed while edmond himself remain
stand escap had never onc occur to him there ar inde
some thing which appear so imposs that the mind doe not dwell on
them for an instant to undermin the ground for fifti feetto devot
three year to a labor which if success would conduct you to a
precipic overhang the seato plung into the wave from the height
of fifti sixti perhap a hundr feet at the risk of be dash to
piec against the rock should you have been fortun enough to have
escap the fire of the sentinel and even suppos all these peril
past then to have to swim for your life a distanc of at least three
mile er you could reach the shorewer difficulti so startl and
formid that dant had never even dream of such a scheme
resign himself rather to death
but the sight of an old man cling to life with so desper a
courag gave a fresh turn to hi idea and inspir him with new
courag anoth older and less strong than he had attempt what he
had not had suffici resolut to undertak and had fail onli
becaus of an error in calcul thi same person with almost
incred patienc and persever had contriv to provid himself
with tool requisit for so unparallel an attempt anoth had done
all thi why then wa it imposs to dant faria had dug hi wai
through fifti feet dant would dig a hundr faria at the ag of
fifti had devot three year to the task he who wa but half as
old would sacrific six faria a priest and savant had not shrunk
from the idea of risk hi life by try to swim a distanc of three
mile to on of the islandsdaum rattonneau or lemair should a
hardi sailor an experienc diver like himself shrink from a similar
task should he who had so often for mere amus sake plung to
the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch hesit to
entertain the same project he could do it in an hour and how mani
time had he for pure pastim continu in the water for more than
twice as long at onc dant resolv to follow the brave exampl of
hi energet companion and to rememb that what ha onc been done
mai be done again
after continu some time in profound medit the young man
suddenli exclaim i have found what you were in search of
faria start have you inde cri he rais hi head with
quick anxieti prai let me know what it is you have discov
the corridor through which you have bore your wai from the cell you
occupi here extend in the same direct as the outer galleri doe
it not
0207m
it doe
and is not abov fifteen feet from it
about that
well then i will tell you what we must do we must pierc through
the corridor by form a side open about the middl as it were the
top part of a cross thi time you will lai your plan more accur
we shall get out into the galleri you have describ kill the sentinel
who guard it and make our escap all we requir to insur success is
courag and that you possess and strength which i am not defici
in as for patienc you have abundantli prove yoursyou shall now see
me prove mine
on instant my dear friend repli the abb it is clear you do
not understand the natur of the courag with which i am endow and
what us i intend make of my strength as for patienc i consid
that i have abundantli exercis that in begin everi morn the
task of the night befor and everi night renew the task of the dai
but then young man and i prai of you to give me your full attent
then i thought i could not be do anyth displeas to the
almighti in try to set an innoc be at libertyon who had
commit no offenc and merit not condemn
and have your notion chang ask dant with much surpris do
you think yourself more guilti in make the attempt sinc you have
encount me
no neither do i wish to incur guilt hitherto i have fanci myself
mere wage war against circumst not men i have thought it no
sin to bore through a wall or destroi a staircas but i cannot so
easili persuad myself to pierc a heart or take awai a life
a slight movement of surpris escap dant
is it possibl said he that where your liberti is at stake you can
allow ani such scrupl to deter you from obtain it
tell me repli faria what ha hinder you from knock down
your jailer with a piec of wood torn from your bedstead dress
yourself in hi cloth and endeavor to escap
simpli the fact that the idea never occur to me answer dant
becaus said the old man the natur repugn to the commiss
of such a crime prevent you from think of it and so it ever is
becaus in simpl and allow thing our natur instinct keep us
from deviat from the strict line of duti the tiger whose natur
teach him to delight in shed blood need but the sens of smell
to show him when hi prei is within hi reach and by follow thi
instinct he is enabl to measur the leap necessari to permit him to
spring on hi victim but man on the contrari loath the idea of
bloodit is not alon that the law of social life inspir him with a
shrink dread of take life hi natur construct and
physiolog format
dant wa confus and silent at thi explan of the thought
which had unconsci been work in hi mind or rather soul for
there ar two distinct sort of idea those that proce from the head
and those that eman from the heart
0209m
sinc my imprison said faria i have thought over all the most
celebr case of escap on record thei have rare been success
those that have been crown with full success have been long medit
upon and carefulli arrang such for instanc as the escap of the
duc de beaufort from the chteau de vincenn that of the abb
dubuquoi from for levqu of latud from the bastil then there ar
those for which chanc sometim afford opportun and those ar the
best of all let us therefor wait patient for some favor
moment and when it present itself profit by it
ah said dant you might well endur the tediou delai you were
constantli emploi in the task you set yourself and when weari with
toil you had your hope to refresh and encourag you
i assur you repli the old man i did not turn to that sourc for
recreat or support
what did you do then
i wrote or studi
were you then permit the us of pen ink and paper
oh no answer the abb i had none but what i made for myself
you made paper pen and ink
ye
dant gaze with admir but he had some difficulti in believ
faria saw thi
when you pai me a visit in my cell my young friend said he i will
show you an entir work the fruit of the thought and reflect of
my whole life mani of them medit over in the shade of the
colosseum at rome at the foot of st mark column at venic and on
the border of the arno at florenc littl imagin at the time that
thei would be arrang in order within the wall of the chteau dif
the work i speak of is call a treatis on the possibl of a
gener monarchi in itali and will make on larg quarto volum
and on what have you written all thi
on two of my shirt i invent a prepar that make linen as
smooth and as easi to write on as parchment
you ar then a chemist
somewhat i know lavoisi and wa the intim friend of cabani
but for such a work you must have need bookshad you ani
i had nearli five thousand volum in my librari at rome but after
read them over mani time i found out that with on hundr and
fifti wellchosen book a man possess if not a complet summari of
all human knowledg at least all that a man need realli know i
devot three year of my life to read and studi these on
hundr and fifti volum till i knew them nearli by heart so that
sinc i have been in prison a veri slight effort of memori ha enabl
me to recal their content as readili as though the page were open
befor me i could recit you the whole of thucydid xenophon
plutarch titu liviu tacitu strada jornand dant montaign
shakespear spinoza machiavelli and bossuet i name onli the most
import
you ar doubtless acquaint with a varieti of languag so as to
have been abl to read all these
ye i speak five of the modern tonguesthat is to sai german
french italian english and spanish by the aid of ancient greek i
learn modern greeki dont speak it so well as i could wish but i am
still try to improv myself
improv yourself repeat dant why how can you manag to do
so
why i made a vocabulari of the word i knew turn return and
arrang them so as to enabl me to express my thought through their
medium i know nearli on thousand word which is all that is
absolut necessari although i believ there ar nearli on hundr
thousand in the dictionari i cannot hope to be veri fluent but i
certainli should have no difficulti in explain my want and wish
and that would be quit as much as i should ever requir
stronger grew the wonder of dant who almost fanci he had to do
with on gift with supernatur power still hope to find some
imperfect which might bring him down to a level with human be
he ad then if you were not furnish with pen how did you manag
to write the work you speak of
i made myself some excel on which would be univers
prefer to all other if onc known you ar awar what huge white
ar serv to us on maigr dai well i select the cartilag of
the head of these fish and you can scarc imagin the delight
with which i welcom the arriv of each wednesdai fridai and
saturdai as afford me the mean of increas my stock of pen for
i will freeli confess that my histor labor have been my greatest
solac and relief while retrac the past i forget the present and
travers at will the path of histori i ceas to rememb that i am
myself a prison
but the ink said dant of what did you make your ink
there wa formerli a fireplac in my dungeon repli faria but it
wa close up long er i becam an occup of thi prison still it
must have been mani year in us for it wa thickli cover with a
coat of soot thi soot i dissolv in a portion of the wine brought
to me everi sundai and i assur you a better ink cannot be desir
for veri import note for which closer attent is requir i
prick on of my finger and wrote with my own blood
and when ask dant mai i see all thi
whenev you pleas repli the abb
oh then let it be directli exclaim the young man
follow me then said the abb as he reenter the subterranean
passag in which he soon disappear follow by dant
chapter 17 the abb chamber
after have pass with toler eas through the subterranean
passag which howev did not admit of their hold themselv
erect the two friend reach the further end of the corridor into
which the abb cell open from that point the passag becam much
narrow and bare permit on to creep through on hand and knee
the floor of the abb cell wa pave and it had been by rais on
of the stone in the most obscur corner that faria had been abl to
commenc the labori task of which dant had wit the
complet
as he enter the chamber of hi friend dant cast around on eager
and search glanc in quest of the expect marvel but noth more
than common met hi view
it is well said the abb we have some hour befor usit is now
just a quarter past twelv oclock instinct dant turn round
to observ by what watch or clock the abb had been abl so accur
to specifi the hour
look at thi rai of light which enter by my window said the abb
and then observ the line trace on the wall well by mean of these
line which ar in accord with the doubl motion of the earth and
the ellips it describ round the sun i am enabl to ascertain the
precis hour with more minut than if i possess a watch for that
might be broken or derang in it movement while the sun and earth
never vari in their appoint path
thi last explan wa wholli lost upon dant who had alwai
imagin from see the sun rise from behind the mountain and set in
the mediterranean that it move and not the earth a doubl movement
of the globe he inhabit and of which he could feel noth appear
to him perfectli imposs each word that fell from hi companion
lip seem fraught with the mysteri of scienc as worthi of dig
out as the gold and diamond in the mine of guzerat and golconda
which he could just recollect have visit dure a voyag made in
hi earliest youth
come said he to the abb i am anxiou to see your treasur
the abb smile and proceed to the disus fireplac rais by
the help of hi chisel a long stone which had doubtless been the
hearth beneath which wa a caviti of consider depth serv as a

0213m
what do you wish to see first ask the abb
oh your great work on the monarchi of itali

linen laid on over the other like fold of papyru these roll
consist of slip of cloth about four inch wide and eighteen long
thei were all carefulli number and close cover with write so

understood
there said he there is the work complet i wrote the word fini
at the end of the sixtyeighth strip about a week ago i have torn up
two of my shirt and as mani handkerchief as i wa master of to

i see answer dant now let me behold the curiou pen with
which you have written your work
look said faria show to the young man a slender stick about six
inch long and much resembl the size of the handl of a fine
paintingbrush to the end of which wa ti by a piec of thread on
of those cartilag of which the abb had befor spoken to dant it
wa point and divid at the nib like an ordinari pen dant
examin it with intens admir then look around to see the
instrument with which it had been shape so correctli into form
ah ye said faria the penknif that my masterpiec i made it
as well as thi larger knife out of an old iron candlestick the
penknif wa sharp and keen as a razor as for the other knife it
would serv a doubl purpos and with it on could cut and thrust
dant examin the variou articl shown to him with the same
attent that he had bestow on the curios and strang tool
exhibit in the shop at marseil as the work of the savag in the
south sea from whenc thei had been brought by the differ trade
vessel
as for the ink said faria i told you how i manag to obtain
thatand i onli just make it from time to time as i requir it
on thing still puzzl me observ dant and that is how you
manag to do all thi by daylight
i work at night also repli faria
nightwhi for heaven sake ar your ey like cat that you can
see to work in the dark
inde thei ar not but god ha suppli man with the intellig
that enabl him to overcom the limit of natur condit i
furnish myself with a light
you did prai tell me how
i separ the fat from the meat serv to me melt it and so made
oilher is my lamp so sai the abb exhibit a sort of torch
veri similar to those us in public illumin
but how do you procur a light
oh here ar two flint and a piec of burnt linen
and match
i pretend that i had a disord of the skin and ask for a littl
sulphur which wa readili suppli
dant laid the differ thing he had been look at on the tabl
and stood with hi head droop on hi breast as though overwhelm
by the persever and strength of faria mind
0215m
you have not seen all yet continu faria for i did not think it
wise to trust all my treasur in the same hidingplac let us shut
thi on up thei put the stone back in it place the abb sprinkl
a littl dust over it to conceal the trace of it have been remov
rub hi foot well on it to make it assum the same appear as the
other and then go toward hi bed he remov it from the spot it
stood in behind the head of the bed and conceal by a stone fit
in so close as to defi all suspicion wa a hollow space and in thi
space a ladder of cord between twentyf and thirti feet in length
dant close and eagerli examin it he found it firm solid and
compact enough to bear ani weight
who suppli you with the materi for make thi wonder work
i tore up sever of my shirt and rip out the seam in the sheet
of my bed dure my three year imprison at fenestrel and when
i wa remov to the chteau dif i manag to bring the ravel
with me so that i have been abl to finish my work here
and wa it not discov that your sheet were unhem
oh no for when i had taken out the thread i requir i hem the
edg over again
with what
with thi needl said the abb as open hi rag vestment he
show dant a long sharp fishbon with a small perfor ey for
the thread a small portion of which still remain in it
i onc thought continu faria of remov these iron bar and
let myself down from the window which as you see is somewhat
wider than your although i should have enlarg it still more
preparatori to my flight howev i discov that i should mere
have drop into a sort of inner court and i therefor renounc the
project altogeth as too full of risk and danger nevertheless i
carefulli preserv my ladder against on of those unforeseen
opportun of which i spoke just now and which sudden chanc
frequent bring about
while affect to be deepli engag in examin the ladder the mind
of dant wa in fact busili occupi by the idea that a person so
intellig ingeni and clearsight as the abb might probabl be
abl to solv the dark mysteri of hi own misfortun where he himself
could see noth
what ar you think of ask the abb smilingli imput the deep
abstract in which hi visitor wa plung to the excess of hi aw
and wonder
i wa reflect in the first place repli dant upon the
enorm degre of intellig and abil you must have emploi to
reach the high perfect to which you have attain what would you
not have accomplish if you had been free
possibl noth at all the overflow of my brain would probabl in a
state of freedom have evapor in a thousand folli misfortun is
need to bring to light the treasur of the human intellect
compress is need to explod gunpowd captiv ha brought my
mental faculti to a focu and you ar well awar that from the
collis of cloud electr is producedfrom electr
lightn from lightn illumin
no repli dant i know noth some of your word ar to me
quit empti of mean you must be bless inde to possess the
knowledg you have
the abb smile well said he but you had anoth subject for your
thought did you not sai so just now
i did
you have told me as yet but on of themlet me hear the other
it wa thisthat while you had relat to me all the particular of
your past life you were perfectli unacquaint with mine
your life my young friend ha not been of suffici length to admit
of your have pass through ani veri import event
it ha been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserv
misfortun i would fain fix the sourc of it on man that i mai no
longer vent reproach upon heaven
then you profess ignor of the crime with which you ar charg
i do inde and thi i swear by the two be most dear to me upon
earthmi father and mercd
come said the abb close hi hidingplac and push the bed
back to it origin situat let me hear your stori
dant obei and commenc what he call hi histori but which
consist onli of the account of a voyag to india and two or three
voyag to the levant until he arriv at the recit of hi last
cruis with the death of captain lecler and the receipt of a packet
to be deliv by himself to the grand marshal hi interview with
that personag and hi receiv in place of the packet brought a
letter address to a monsieur noirtierhi arriv at marseil and
interview with hi fatherhi affect for mercd and their nuptual
feasthi arrest and subsequ examin hi temporari detent at
the palai de justic and hi final imprison in the chteau dif
from thi point everyth wa a blank to dantsh knew noth more
not even the length of time he had been imprison hi recit
finish the abb reflect long and earnestli
there is said he at the end of hi medit a clever maxim
which bear upon what i wa sai to you some littl while ago and
that is that unless wick idea take root in a natur deprav
mind human natur in a right and wholesom state revolt at crime
still from an artifici civil have origin want vice
and fals tast which occasion becom so power as to stifl
within us all good feel and ultim to lead us into guilt and
wicked from thi view of thing then come the axiom that if you
visit to discov the author of ani bad action seek first to discov
the person to whom the perpetr of that bad action could be in ani
wai advantag now to appli it in your caseto whom could your
disappear have been servic
to no on by heaven i wa a veri insignific person
do not speak thu for your repli evinc neither logic nor
philosophi everyth is rel my dear young friend from the king
who stand in the wai of hi successor to the employe who keep hi
rival out of a place now in the event of the king death hi
successor inherit a crownwhen the employe di the supernumerari
step into hi shoe and receiv hi salari of twelv thousand
livr well these twelv thousand livr ar hi civil list and ar
as essenti to him as the twelv million of a king everyon from
the highest to the lowest degre ha hi place on the social ladder
and is beset by stormi passion and conflict interest as in
descart theori of pressur and impuls but these forc increas
as we go higher so that we have a spiral which in defianc of reason
rest upon the apex and not on the base now let us return to your
particular world you sai you were on the point of be made captain
of the pharaon
ye
and about to becom the husband of a young and love girl
ye
now could anyon have had ani interest in prevent the
accomplish of these two thing but let us first settl the
question as to it be the interest of anyon to hinder you from
be captain of the pharaon what sai you
i cannot believ such wa the case i wa gener like on board
and had the sailor possess the right of select a captain
themselv i feel convinc their choic would have fallen on me
there wa onli on person among the crew who had ani feel of
illwil toward me i had quarel with him some time previous and
had even challeng him to fight me but he refus
now we ar get on and what wa thi man name
danglar
what rank did he hold on board
he wa supercargo
and had you been captain should you have retain him in hi
employ
not if the choic had remain with me for i had frequent observ
inaccuraci in hi account
good again now then tell me wa ani person present dure your last
convers with captain lecler
no we were quit alon
could your convers have been overheard by anyon
it might for the cabin door wa openandstai now i
recollectdanglar himself pass by just as captain lecler wa
give me the packet for the grand marshal
that better cri the abb now we ar on the right scent did
you take anybodi with you when you put into the port of elba
nobodi
somebodi there receiv your packet and gave you a letter in place of
it i think
ye the grand marshal did
and what did you do with that letter
put it into my portfolio
you had your portfolio with you then now how could a sailor find
room in hi pocket for a portfolio larg enough to contain an offici
letter
you ar right it wa left on board
then it wa not till your return to the ship that you put the letter
in the portfolio
no
and what did you do with thi same letter while return from
portoferrajo to the vessel
i carri it in my hand
so that when you went on board the pharaon everybodi could see that
you held a letter in your hand
ye
danglar as well as the rest
danglar as well as other
now listen to me and try to recal everi circumst attend your
arrest do you recollect the word in which the inform against you
wa formul
oh ye i read it over three time and the word sank deepli into my
memori
repeat it to me
dant paus a moment then said thi is it word for word the
king attornei is inform by a friend to the throne and religion
that on edmond dant mate on board the pharaon thi dai arriv
from smyrna after have touch at napl and portoferrajo ha been
intrust by murat with a packet for the usurp again by the
usurp with a letter for the bonapartist club in pari thi proof of
hi guilt mai be procur by hi immedi arrest as the letter will
be found either about hi person at hi father resid or in hi
cabin on board the pharaon
the abb shrug hi shoulder the thing is clear as dai said he
and you must have had a veri confid natur as well as a good
heart not to have suspect the origin of the whole affair
do you realli think so ah that would inde be infam
how did danglar usual write
in a handsom run hand
and how wa the anonym letter written
backhand
again the abb smile disguis
it wa veri boldli written if disguis
stop a bit said the abb take up what he call hi pen and
after dip it into the ink he wrote on a piec of prepar linen
with hi left hand the first two or three word of the accus
dant drew back and gaze on the abb with a sensat almost
amount to terror
how veri astonish cri he at length why your write exactli
resembl that of the accus
simpli becaus that accus had been written with the left hand
and i have notic that
what
that while the write of differ person done with the right hand
vari that perform with the left hand is invari uniform
you have evid seen and observ everyth
let us proce
oh ye ye
now as regard the second question
i am listen
wa there ani person whose interest it wa to prevent your marriag
with mercd
ye a young man who love her
and hi name wa
fernand
that is a spanish name i think
he wa a catalan
you imagin him capabl of write the letter
oh no he would more like have got rid of me by stick a knife
into me
that is in strict accord with the spanish charact an
assassin thei will unhesitatingli commit but an act of cowardic
never
besid said dant the variou circumst mention in the
letter were wholli unknown to him
you had never spoken of them yourself to anyon
to no on
not even to your mistress
no not even to my betroth
then it is danglar
i feel quit sure of it now
wait a littl prai wa danglar acquaint with fernand
noy he wa now i recollect
what
to have seen them both sit at tabl togeth under an arbor at
pre pamphil the even befor the dai fix for my wed thei
were in earnest convers danglar wa joke in a friendli wai
but fernand look pale and agit
were thei alon
there wa a third person with them whom i knew perfectli well and who
had in all probabl made their acquaint he wa a tailor name
caderouss but he wa veri drunk staystayhow strang that it
should not have occur to me befor now i rememb quit well that
on the tabl round which thei were sit were pen ink and paper
oh the heartless treacher scoundrel exclaim dant press
hi hand to hi throb brow
is there anyth els i can assist you in discov besid the
villani of your friend inquir the abb with a laugh
ye ye repli dant eagerli i would beg of you who see so
complet to the depth of thing and to whom the greatest mysteri
seem but an easi riddl to explain to me how it wa that i underw
no second examin wa never brought to trial and abov all wa
condemn without ever have had sentenc pass on me
that is altogeth a differ and more seriou matter respond the
abb the wai of justic ar frequent too dark and mysteri to be
easili penetr all we have hitherto done in the matter ha been
child plai if you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of
the busi you must assist me by the most minut inform on
everi point
prai ask me whatev question you pleas for in good truth you see
more clearli into my life than i do myself
in the first place then who examin youth king attornei hi
deputi or a magistr
the deputi
wa he young or old
about six or sevenandtwenti year of ag i should sai
so answer the abb old enough to be ambiti but too young to
be corrupt and how did he treat you
with more of mild than sever
did you tell him your whole stori
i did
and did hi conduct chang at all in the cours of your examin
he did appear much disturb when he read the letter that had brought
me into thi scrape he seem quit overcom by my misfortun
by your misfortun
ye
then you feel quit sure that it wa your misfortun he deplor
he gave me on great proof of hi sympathi at ani rate
and that
he burnt the sole evid that could at all have crimin me
what the accus
no the letter
ar you sure
i saw it done
that alter the case thi man might after all be a greater
scoundrel than you have thought possibl
upon my word said dant you make me shudder is the world fill
with tiger and crocodil
ye and rememb that twoleg tiger and crocodil ar more
danger than the other
never mind let us go on
with all my heart you tell me he burn the letter
he did sai at the same time you see i thu destroi the onli
proof exist against you
thi action is somewhat too sublim to be natur
you think so
i am sure of it to whom wa thi letter address
to m noirtier rue coqhron no 13 pari
now can you conceiv of ani interest that your heroic deputi could
possibl have had in the destruct of that letter
why it is not altogeth imposs he might have had for he made me
promis sever time never to speak of that letter to anyon assur
me he so advis me for my own interest and more than thi he
insist on my take a solemn oath never to utter the name mention
in the address
noirtier repeat the abb noirtieri knew a person of that name
at the court of the queen of etruriaa noirtier who had been a
girondin dure the revolut what wa your deputi call
de villefort the abb burst into a fit of laughter while dant
gaze on him in utter astonish
what ail you said he at length
do you see that rai of sunlight
i do
well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you
poor fellow poor young man and you tell me thi magistr express
great sympathi and commiser for you
he did
and the worthi man destroi your compromis letter
ye
and then made you swear never to utter the name of noirtier
ye
why you poor shortsight simpleton can you not guess who thi
noirtier wa whose veri name he wa so care to keep conceal thi
noirtier wa hi father
had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of dant or hell open it
yawn gulf befor him he could not have been more complet
transfix with horror than he wa at the sound of these unexpect
word start up he clasp hi hand around hi head as though to
prevent hi veri brain from burst and exclaim hi father hi
father
ye hi father repli the abb hi right name wa noirtier de
villefort
at thi instant a bright light shot through the mind of dant and
clear up all that had been dark and obscur befor the chang that
had come over villefort dure the examin the destruct of the
letter the exact promis the almost supplic tone of the
magistr who seem rather to implor merci than to pronounc
punishmental return with a stun forc to hi memori he cri
out and stagger against the wall like a drunken man then he hurri
to the open that led from the abb cell to hi own and said i
must be alon to think over all thi
when he regain hi dungeon he threw himself on hi bed where the
turnkei found him in the even visit sit with fix gaze and
contract featur dumb and motionless as a statu dure these
hour of profound medit which to him had seem onli minut he
had form a fear resolut and bound himself to it fulfil by
a solemn oath
dant wa at length rous from hi reveri by the voic of faria
who have also been visit by hi jailer had come to invit hi
fellowsuffer to share hi supper the reput of be out of hi
mind though harmlessli and even amusingli so had procur for the
abb unusu privileg he wa suppli with bread of a finer whiter
qualiti than the usual prison fare and even regal each sundai with a
small quantiti of wine now thi wa a sundai and the abb had come to
ask hi young companion to share the luxuri with him
dant follow him hi featur were no longer contract and now
wore their usual express but there wa that in hi whole appear
that bespok on who had come to a fix and desper resolv faria
bent on him hi penetr ey
i regret now said he have help you in your late inquiri or
have given you the inform i did
why so inquir dant
becaus it ha instil a new passion in your heartthat of
vengeanc
dant smile let us talk of someth els said he
again the abb look at him then mournfulli shook hi head but in
accord with dant request he began to speak of other matter
the elder prison wa on of those person whose convers like
that of all who have experienc mani trial contain mani us and
import hint as well as sound inform but it wa never
egotist for the unfortun man never allud to hi own sorrow
dant listen with admir attent to all he said some of hi
remark correspond with what he alreadi knew or appli to the sort
of knowledg hi nautic life had enabl him to acquir a part of
the good abb word howev were wholli incomprehens to him
but like the aurora which guid the navig in northern latitud
open new vista to the inquir mind of the listen and gave
fantast glimps of new horizon enabl him justli to estim the
delight an intellectu mind would have in follow on so richli
gift as faria along the height of truth where he wa so much at
home
you must teach me a small part of what you know said dant if
onli to prevent your grow weari of me i can well believ that so
learn a person as yourself would prefer absolut solitud to be
torment with the compani of on as ignor and uninform as myself
if you will onli agre to my request i promis you never to mention
anoth word about escap
the abb smile
ala my boi said he human knowledg is confin within veri
narrow limit and when i have taught you mathemat physic
histori and the three or four modern languag with which i am
acquaint you will know as much as i do myself now it will scarc
requir two year for me to commun to you the stock of learn i
possess
two year exclaim dant do you realli believ i can acquir all
these thing in so short a time
not their applic certainli but their principl you mai to
learn is not to know there ar the learner and the learn memori
make the on philosophi the other
but cannot on learn philosophi
philosophi cannot be taught it is the applic of the scienc to
truth it is like the golden cloud in which the messiah went up into
heaven
well then said dant what shall you teach me first i am in a
hurri to begin i want to learn
everyth said the abb and that veri even the prison
sketch a plan of educ to be enter upon the follow dai
dant possess a prodigi memori combin with an astonish
quick and readi of concept the mathemat turn of hi
mind render him apt at all kind of calcul while hi natur
poetic feel threw a light and pleas veil over the dry realiti
of arithmet comput or the rigid sever of geometri he
alreadi knew italian and had also pick up a littl of the romaic
dialect dure voyag to the east and by the aid of these two
languag he easili comprehend the construct of all the other so
that at the end of six month he began to speak spanish english and
german
in strict accord with the promis made to the abb dant spoke no
more of escap perhap the delight hi studi afford him left no
room for such thought perhap the recollect that he had pledg
hi word on which hi sens of honor wa keen kept him from refer
in ani wai to the possibl of flight dai even month pass by
unheed in on rapid and instruct cours at the end of a year
dant wa a new man dant observ howev that faria in spite of
the relief hi societi afford daili grew sadder on thought seem
incessantli to harass and distract hi mind sometim he would fall
into long reveri sigh heavili and involuntarili then suddenli rise
and with fold arm begin pace the confin space of hi dungeon
on dai he stop all at onc and exclaim
ah if there were no sentinel
there shall not be on a minut longer than you pleas said dant
who had follow the work of hi thought as accur as though
hi brain were enclos in crystal so clear as to displai it minutest
oper
i have alreadi told you answer the abb that i loath the idea
of shed blood
and yet the murder if you choos to call it so would be simpli a
measur of selfpreserv
no matter i could never agre to it
still you have thought of it
incessantli ala cri the abb
and you have discov a mean of regain our freedom have you
not ask dant eagerli
i have if it were onli possibl to place a deaf and blind sentinel in
the galleri beyond us
he shall be both blind and deaf repli the young man with an air
of determin that made hi companion shudder

dant endeavor to renew the subject the abb shook hi head in
token of disapprov and refus to make ani further respons three
month pass awai
ar you strong the abb ask on dai of dant the young man in
repli took up the chisel bent it into the form of a horsesho and
then as readili straighten it
and will you engag not to do ani harm to the sentri except as a last

then said the abb we mai hope to put our design into execut
and how long shall we be in accomplish the necessari work
at least a year
and shall we begin at onc

we have lost a year to no purpos cri dant
do you consid the last twelv month to have been wast ask the
abb
forgiv me cri edmond blush deepli
tut tut answer the abb man is but man after all and you ar
about the best specimen of the genu i have ever known come let me
show you my plan
the abb then show dant the sketch he had made for their escap it
consist of a plan of hi own cell and that of dant with the
passag which unit them in thi passag he propos to drive a level
as thei do in mine thi level would bring the two prison
immedi beneath the galleri where the sentri kept watch onc
there a larg excav would be made and on of the flagston
with which the galleri wa pave be so complet loosen that at the
desir moment it would give wai beneath the feet of the soldier who
stun by hi fall would be immedi bound and gag by dant
befor he had power to offer ani resist the prison were then to
make their wai through on of the galleri window and to let
themselv down from the outer wall by mean of the abb ladder of
cord
dant ey sparkl with joi and he rub hi hand with delight at
the idea of a plan so simpl yet appar so certain to succe
that veri dai the miner began their labor with a vigor and alacr
proportion to their long rest from fatigu and their hope of
ultim success noth interrupt the progress of the work except
the necess that each wa under of return to hi cell in

intercours with person of high birth and breed
at the end of fifteen month the level wa finish and the excav

hear the measur tread of the sentinel as he pace to and fro over
their head compel as thei were to await a night suffici
dark to favor their flight thei were oblig to defer their final
attempt till that auspici moment should arriv their greatest dread
now wa lest the stone through which the sentri wa doom to fall

you know said the abb that i wa the secretari and intim
friend of cardin spada the last of the princ of that name i ow
to thi worthi lord all the happi i ever knew he wa not rich
although the wealth of hi famili had pass into a proverb and i
heard the phrase veri often as rich as a spada but he like public
rumor live on thi reput for wealth hi palac wa my paradis
i wa tutor to hi nephew who ar dead and when he wa alon in the
world i tri by absolut devot to hi will to make up to him all
he had done for me dure ten year of unremit kind the
cardin hous had no secret for me i had often seen my nobl
patron annot ancient volum and eagerli search amongst dusti
famili manuscript on dai when i wa reproach him for hi
unavail search and deplor the prostrat of mind that
follow them he look at me and smile bitterli open a volum
relat to the histori of the citi of rome there in the twentieth
chapter of the life of pope alexand vi were the follow line
which i can never forget
the great war of romagna had end csar borgia who had complet
hi conquest had need of monei to purchas all itali the pope had
also need of monei to bring matter to an end with loui xii king of
franc who wa formid still in spite of hi recent revers and
it wa necessari therefor to have recours to some profit
scheme which wa a matter of great difficulti in the impoverish
condit of exhaust itali hi holi had an idea he determin
to make two cardin
by choos two of the greatest personag of rome especi rich
menthi wa the return the holi father look for in the first
place he could sell the great appoint and splendid offic which
the cardin alreadi held and then he had the two hat to sell
besid there wa a third point in view which will appear hereaft
the pope and csar borgia first found the two futur cardin thei
were giovanni rospigliosi who held four of the highest digniti of
the holi see and csar spada on of the noblest and richest of the
roman nobil both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope
thei were ambiti and csar borgia soon found purchas for their
appoint the result wa that rospigliosi and spada paid for be
cardin and eight other person paid for the offic the cardin
held befor their elev and thu eight hundr thousand crown
enter into the coffer of the specul
0239m
it is time now to proce to the last part of the specul the
pope heap attent upon rospigliosi and spada confer upon them
the insignia of the cardinal and induc them to arrang their
affair and take up their resid at rome then the pope and csar
borgia invit the two cardin to dinner thi wa a matter of
disput between the holi father and hi son csar thought thei could
make us of on of the mean which he alwai had readi for hi friend
that is to sai in the first place the famou kei which wa given to
certain person with the request that thei go and open a design
cupboard thi kei wa furnish with a small iron pointa neglig
on the part of the locksmith when thi wa press to effect the
open of the cupboard of which the lock wa difficult the person
wa prick by thi small point and di next dai then there wa the
ring with the lion head which csar wore when he want to greet hi
friend with a clasp of the hand the lion bit the hand thu favor
and at the end of twentyfour hour the bite wa mortal
csar propos to hi father that thei should either ask the
cardin to open the cupboard or shake hand with them but alexand
vi repli now as to the worthi cardin spada and rospigliosi
let us ask both of them to dinner someth tell me that we shall get
that monei back besid you forget csar an indigest declar
itself immedi while a prick or a bite occas a delai of a dai
or two csar gave wai befor such cogent reason and the cardin
were consequ invit to dinner
the tabl wa laid in a vineyard belong to the pope near san
pierdarena a charm retreat which the cardin knew veri well by
report rospigliosi quit set up with hi new digniti went with a
good appetit and hi most ingrati manner spada a prudent man
and greatli attach to hi onli nephew a young captain of the highest
promis took paper and pen and made hi will he then sent word to
hi nephew to wait for him near the vineyard but it appear the
servant did not find him
spada knew what these invit meant sinc christian so
emin civil had made progress in rome it wa no longer a
centurion who came from the tyrant with a messag csar will that
you die but it wa a legat later who came with a smile on hi
lip to sai from the pope hi holi request you to dine with
him
spada set out about two oclock to san pierdarena the pope await
him the first sight that attract the ey of spada wa that of hi
nephew in full costum and csar borgia pai him most mark
attent spada turn pale as csar look at him with an iron
air which prove that he had anticip all and that the snare wa
well spread
thei began dinner and spada wa onli abl to inquir of hi nephew if
he had receiv hi messag the nephew repli no perfectli
comprehend the mean of the question it wa too late for he had
alreadi drunk a glass of excel wine place for him expressli by
the pope butler spada at the same moment saw anoth bottl approach
him which he wa press to tast an hour afterward a physician
declar thei were both poison through eat mushroom spada di
on the threshold of the vineyard the nephew expir at hi own door
make sign which hi wife could not comprehend
then csar and the pope hasten to lai hand on the heritag under
pretens of seek for the paper of the dead man but the inherit
consist in thi onli a scrap of paper on which spada had writteni
bequeath to my belov nephew my coffer my book and amongst
other my breviari with the gold corner which i beg he will preserv
in remembr of hi affection uncl
the heir sought everywher admir the breviari laid hand on the
furnitur and were greatli astonish that spada the rich man wa
realli the most miser of unclesno treasuresunless thei were those
of scienc contain in the librari and laboratori that wa all
csar and hi father search examin scrutin but found
noth or at least veri littl not exceed a few thousand crown
in plate and about the same in readi monei but the nephew had time to
sai to hi wife befor he expir look well among my uncl paper
there is a will
thei sought even more thoroughli than the august heir had done but
it wa fruitless there were two palac and a vineyard behind the
palatin hill but in these dai land properti had not much valu
and the two palac and the vineyard remain to the famili sinc thei
were beneath the rapac of the pope and hi son month and year
roll on alexand vi di poisonedy know by what mistak
csar poison at the same time escap by shed hi skin like a
snake but the new skin wa spot by the poison till it look like a
tiger then compel to quit rome he went and got himself
obscur kill in a night skirmish scarc notic in histori
after the pope death and hi son exil it wa suppos that the
spada famili would resum the splendid posit thei had held befor
the cardin time but thi wa not the case the spada remain in
doubt eas a mysteri hung over thi dark affair and the public
rumor wa that csar a better politician than hi father had carri
off from the pope the fortun of the two cardin i sai the two
becaus cardin rospigliosi who had not taken ani precaut wa
complet despoil
up to thi point said faria interrupt the thread of hi
narr thi seem to you veri meaningless no doubt eh
oh my friend cri dant on the contrari it seem as if i were
read a most interest narr go on i beg of you
i will the famili began to get accustom to their obscur year
roll on and amongst the descend some were soldier other
diplomatist some churchmen some banker some grew rich and some
were ruin i come now to the last of the famili whose secretari i
wasth count of spada i had often heard him complain of the
disproport of hi rank with hi fortun and i advis him to invest
all he had in an annuiti he did so and thu doubl hi incom the
celebr breviari remain in the famili and wa in the count
possess it had been hand down from father to son for the
singular claus of the onli will that had been found had caus it to
be regard as a genuin relic preserv in the famili with
superstiti vener it wa an illumin book with beauti
gothic charact and so weighti with gold that a servant alwai
carri it befor the cardin on dai of great solemn
at the sight of paper of all sortstitl contract parchment
which were kept in the archiv of the famili all descend from the
poison cardin i in my turn examin the immens bundl of
document like twenti servitor steward secretari befor me but
in spite of the most exhaust research i foundnoth yet i had
read i had even written a precis histori of the borgia famili for
the sole purpos of assur myself whether ani increas of fortun had
occur to them on the death of the cardin csar spada but could
onli trace the acquisit of the properti of the cardin rospigliosi
hi companion in misfortun
i wa then almost assur that the inherit had neither profit
the borgia nor the famili but had remain unpossess like the
treasur of the arabian night which slept in the bosom of the earth
under the ey of the geni i search ransack count calcul
a thousand and a thousand time the incom and expenditur of the

i did aid by the remain fragment i guess the rest measur
the length of the line by those of the paper and divin the hidden
mean by mean of what wa in part reveal as we ar guid in a
cavern by the small rai of light abov us
and what did you do when you arriv at thi conclus
i resolv to set out and did set out at that veri instant carri
with me the begin of my great work the uniti of the italian
kingdom but for some time the imperi polic who at thi period
quit contrari to what napoleon desir so soon as he had a son born to

express now my dear fellow you know as much as i do myself if
we ever escap togeth half thi treasur is your if i die here
and you escap alon the whole belong to you
but inquir dant hesit ha thi treasur no more
legitim possessor in the world than ourselv
no no be easi on that score the famili is extinct the last count
of spada moreov made me hi heir bequeath to me thi symbol
breviari he bequeath to me all it contain no no make your mind
satisfi on that point if we lai hand on thi fortun we mai enjoi
it without remors
and you sai thi treasur amount to
two million of roman crown nearli thirteen million of our money2
imposs said dant stagger at the enorm amount
imposs and why ask the old man the spada famili wa on of
the oldest and most power famili of the fifteenth centuri and in
those time when other opportun for invest were want such
accumul of gold and jewel were by no mean rare there ar at
thi dai roman famili perish of hunger though possess of nearli
a million in diamond and jewel hand down by entail and which thei
cannot touch
edmond thought he wa in a dreamh waver between incredul and
joi
i have onli kept thi secret so long from you continu faria that
i might test your charact and then surpris you had we escap
befor my attack of catalepsi i should have conduct you to mont
cristo now he ad with a sigh it is you who will conduct me
thither well dant you do not thank me
thi treasur belong to you my dear friend repli dant and to
you onli i have no right to it i am no relat of your
you ar my son dant exclaim the old man you ar the child of
my captiv my profess condemn me to celibaci god ha sent you
to me to consol at on and the same time the man who could not be a
father and the prison who could not get free
and faria extend the arm of which alon the us remain to him to
the young man who threw himself upon hi neck and wept
chapter 19 the third attack
now that thi treasur which had so long been the object of the abb
medit could insur the futur happi of him whom faria realli
love as a son it had doubl it valu in hi ey and everi dai he
expati on the amount explain to dant all the good which with
thirteen or fourteen million of franc a man could do in these dai
to hi friend and then dant counten becam gloomi for the
oath of vengeanc he had taken recur to hi memori and he reflect
how much ill in these time a man with thirteen or fourteen million
could do to hi enemi
the abb did not know the island of mont cristo but dant knew it
and had often pass it situat twentyf mile from pianosa
between corsica and the island of elba and had onc touch there
thi island wa alwai had been and still is complet desert it
is a rock of almost conic form which look as though it had been
thrust up by volcan forc from the depth to the surfac of the ocean
dant drew a plan of the island for faria and faria gave dant
advic as to the mean he should emploi to recov the treasur but
dant wa far from be as enthusiast and confid as the old man
it wa past a question now that faria wa not a lunat and the wai in
which he had achiev the discoveri which had given rise to the
suspicion of hi mad increas edmond admir of him but at
the same time dant could not believ that the deposit suppos it
had ever exist still exist and though he consid the treasur
as by no mean chimer he yet believ it wa no longer there
howev as if fate resolv on depriv the prison of their last
chanc and make them understand that thei were condemn to
perpetu imprison a new misfortun befel them the galleri on
the sea side which had long been in ruin wa rebuilt thei had
repair it complet and stop up with vast mass of stone the
hole dant had partli fill in but for thi precaut which it
will be rememb the abb had made to edmond the misfortun would
have been still greater for their attempt to escap would have been
detect and thei would undoubtedli have been separ thu a new a
stronger and more inexor barrier wa interpos to cut off the
realiz of their hope
you see said the young man with an air of sorrow resign to
faria that god deem it right to take from me ani claim to merit for
what you call my devot to you i have promis to remain forev
with you and now i could not break my promis if i would the treasur
will be no more mine than your and neither of us will quit thi
prison but my real treasur is not that my dear friend which await
me beneath the sombr rock of mont cristo it is your presenc our
live togeth five or six hour a dai in spite of our jailer it is
the rai of intellig you have elicit from my brain the languag
you have implant in my memori and which have taken root there with
all their philolog ramif these differ scienc that you
have made so easi to me by the depth of the knowledg you possess of
them and the clear of the principl to which you have reduc
themthi is my treasur my belov friend and with thi you have

pulsat becom more and more deep and dull until at length it
stop the last movement of the heart ceas the face becam livid
the ey remain open but the eyebal were glaze
it wa six oclock in the morn the dawn wa just break and it
feebl rai came into the dungeon and pale the ineffectu light of

edmond did not lose a word but comprehend veri littl of what wa

some turnkei to watch the dead he remain therefor mute and
motionless hardli ventur to breath at the end of an hour he
heard a faint nois which increas it wa the governor who return

the inquiri soon commenc
the doctor analyz the symptom of the maladi to which the prison

follow in a nonchal manner that made dant indign for he felt
that all the world should have for the poor abb a love and respect
equal to hi own
i am veri sorri for what you tell me said the governor repli to

afterward a turnkei enter sai
here is the brazier light
there wa a moment silenc and then wa heard the crackl of
burn flesh of which the peculiar and nauseou smell penetr even
behind the wall where dant wa listen in horror the perspir
pour forth upon the young man brow and he felt as if he should

footstep go and come were now heard and a moment afterward
the nois of rustl canva reach dant ear the bed creak and
the heavi footfal of a man who lift a weight sound on the floor
then the bed again creak under the weight deposit upon it
thi even said the governor
will there be ani mass ask on of the attend
that is imposs repli the governor the chaplain of the
chteau came to me yesterdai to beg for leav of absenc in order to
take a trip to hyre for a week i told him i would attend to the
prison in hi absenc if the poor abb had not been in such a
hurri he might have had hi requiem
pooh pooh said the doctor with the impieti usual in person of hi
profess he is a churchman god will respect hi profess and
not give the devil the wick delight of send him a priest a shout
of laughter follow thi brutal jest meanwhil the oper of

thi even said the governor when the task wa end
at what hour inquir a turnkei
why about ten or eleven oclock
shall we watch by the corps
of what us would it be shut the dungeon as if he were alivethat is
all
then the step retreat and the voic di awai in the distanc the
nois of the door with it creak hing and bolt ceas and a
silenc more sombr than that of solitud ensuedth silenc of death
which wa allpervas and struck it ici chill to the veri soul of
dant
then he rais the flagston cautious with hi head and look
carefulli around the chamber it wa empti and dant emerg from the
tunnel
chapter 20 the cemeteri of the chteau dif
on the bed at full length and faintli illumin by the pale light
that came from the window lai a sack of canva and under it rude
fold wa stretch a long and stiffen form it wa faria last
windingsheeta windingsheet which as the turnkei said cost so
littl everyth wa in readi a barrier had been place between
dant and hi old friend no longer could edmond look into those
wideopen ey which had seem to be penetr the mysteri of
death no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make
hi exist bless faria the benefic and cheer companion
with whom he wa accustom to live so intim no longer breath
he seat himself on the edg of that terribl bed and fell into
melancholi and gloomi reveri
alon he wa alon again again condemn to silenceagain face to
face with nothing alonenev again to see the face never again
to hear the voic of the onli human be who unit him to earth wa
not faria fate the better after allto solv the problem of life at
it sourc even at the risk of horribl suffer
the idea of suicid which hi friend had driven awai and kept awai by
hi cheer presenc now hover like a phantom over the abb dead
bodi
if i could die he said i should go where he goe and should
assuredli find him again but how to die it is veri easi he went on
with a smile i will remain here rush on the first person that open
the door strangl him and then thei will guillotin me
but excess grief is like a storm at sea where the frail bark is
toss from the depth to the top of the wave dant recoil from the
idea of so infam a death and pass suddenli from despair to an
ardent desir for life and liberti
die oh no he exclaimednot die now after have live and
suffer so long and so much die ye had i di year ago but now
to die would be inde to give wai to the sarcasm of destini no i
want to live i shall struggl to the veri last i will yet win back
the happi of which i have been depriv befor i die i must not
forget that i have my execution to punish and perhap too who
know some friend to reward yet thei will forget me here and i
shall die in my dungeon like faria
as he said thi he becam silent and gaze straight befor him like
on overwhelm with a strang and amaz thought suddenli he aros
lift hi hand to hi brow as if hi brain were giddi pace twice or
thrice round the dungeon and then paus abruptli by the bed
just god he mutter whenc come thi thought is it from thee
sinc none but the dead pass freeli from thi dungeon let me take the
place of the dead
without give himself time to reconsid hi decis and inde
that he might not allow hi thought to be distract from hi
desper resolut he bent over the appal shroud open it with
the knife which faria had made drew the corps from the sack and bore
it along the tunnel to hi own chamber laid it on hi couch ti
around it head the rag he wore at night around hi own cover it
with hi counterpan onc again kiss the icecold brow and tri
vainli to close the resist ey which glare horribl turn the
head toward the wall so that the jailer might when he brought the
even meal believ that he wa asleep as wa hi frequent custom
enter the tunnel again drew the bed against the wall return to
the other cell took from the hidingplac the needl and thread flung
off hi rag that thei might feel onli nake flesh beneath the coars
canva and get insid the sack place himself in the postur in
which the dead bodi had been laid and sew up the mouth of the sack
from the insid
he would have been discov by the beat of hi heart if by ani
mischanc the jailer had enter at that moment dant might have
wait until the even visit wa over but he wa afraid that the
governor would chang hi mind and order the dead bodi to be remov
earlier in that case hi last hope would have been destroi
now hi plan were fulli made and thi is what he intend to do if
while he wa be carri out the gravedigg should discov that
thei were bear a live instead of a dead bodi dant did not intend
to give them time to recogn him but with a sudden cut of the knife
he meant to open the sack from top to bottom and profit by their
alarm escap if thei tri to catch him he would us hi knife to
better purpos
0263m
if thei took him to the cemeteri and laid him in a grave he would
allow himself to be cover with earth and then as it wa night the
gravedigg could scarc have turn their back befor he would
have work hi wai through the yield soil and escap he hope
that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not
overcom it if he wa detect in thi and the earth prove too heavi
he would be stifl and thenso much the better all would be over
dant had not eaten sinc the preced even but he had not
thought of hunger nor did he think of it now hi situat wa too
precari to allow him even time to reflect on ani thought but on
the first risk that dant ran wa that the jailer when he brought
him hi supper at seven oclock might perceiv the chang that had
been made fortun twenti time at least from misanthropi or
fatigu dant had receiv hi jailer in bed and then the man place
hi bread and soup on the tabl and went awai without sai a word
thi time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to
dant and see that he receiv no repli go to the bed and thu
discov all
when seven oclock came dant agoni realli began hi hand place
upon hi heart wa unabl to redress it throb while with the
other he wipe the perspir from hi templ from time to time
chill ran through hi whole bodi and clutch hi heart in a grasp of
ic then he thought he wa go to die yet the hour pass on
without ani unusu disturb and dant knew that he had escap
the first peril it wa a good auguri
at length about the hour the governor had appoint footstep were
heard on the stair edmond felt that the moment had arriv summon
up all hi courag held hi breath and would have been happi if at
the same time he could have repress the throb of hi vein the
footstepsthei were doublepaus at the doorand dant guess that
the two gravedigg had come to seek himthi idea wa soon convert
into certainti when he heard the nois thei made in put down the
handbier
the door open and a dim light reach dant ey through the
coars sack that cover him he saw two shadow approach hi bed a
third remain at the door with a torch in it hand the two men
approach the end of the bed took the sack by it extrem
he heavi though for an old and thin man said on as he rais
the head
thei sai everi year add half a pound to the weight of the bone
said anoth lift the feet
have you ti the knot inquir the first speaker
what would be the us of carri so much more weight wa the repli
i can do that when we get there
ye your right repli the companion
what the knot for thought dant
thei deposit the suppos corps on the bier edmond stiffen
himself in order to plai the part of a dead man and then the parti
light by the man with the torch who went first ascend the stair
suddenli he felt the fresh and sharp night air and dant knew that
the mistral wa blow it wa a sensat in which pleasur and pain
were strang mingl
the bearer went on for twenti pace then stop put the bier
down on the ground on of them went awai and dant heard hi shoe
strike on the pavement
where am i he ask himself
realli he is by no mean a light load said the other bearer
sit on the edg of the handbarrow
dant first impuls wa to escap but fortun he did not attempt
it
give us a light said the other bearer or i shall never find what i
am look for
the man with the torch compli although not ask in the most polit
term
what can he be look for thought edmond the spade perhap
an exclam of satisfact indic that the gravedigg had
found the object of hi search here it is at last he said not
without some troubl though
ye wa the answer but it ha lost noth by wait
as he said thi the man came toward edmond who heard a heavi
metal substanc laid down besid him and at the same moment a cord
wa fasten round hi feet with sudden and pain violenc
well have you ti the knot inquir the gravedigg who wa
look on
ye and pretti tight too i can tell you wa the answer
move on then and the bier wa lift onc more and thei proceed
thei advanc fifti pace farther and then stop to open a door
then went forward again the nois of the wave dash against the
rock on which the chteau is built reach dant ear distinctli as
thei went forward
bad weather observ on of the bearer not a pleasant night for a
dip in the sea
why ye the abb run a chanc of be wet said the other and
then there wa a burst of brutal laughter
dant did not comprehend the jest but hi hair stood erect on hi
head
well here we ar at last said on of them
a littl farthera littl farther said the other you know veri
well that the last wa stop on hi wai dash on the rock and the
governor told us next dai that we were careless fellow
thei ascend five or six more step and then dant felt that thei
took him on by the head and the other by the heel and swung him to
and fro
on said the gravedigg two three
and at the same instant dant felt himself flung into the air like a
wound bird fall fall with a rapid that made hi blood
curdl although drawn downward by the heavi weight which hasten hi
rapid descent it seem to him as if the fall last for a centuri at
last with a horribl splash he dart like an arrow into the icecold
water and as he did so he utter a shrill cry stifl in a moment by
hi immers beneath the wave
dant had been flung into the sea and wa drag into it depth by
a thirtysixpound shot ti to hi feet
the sea is the cemeteri of the chteau dif
0267m
chapter 21 the island of tiboulen
dant although stun and almost suffoc had suffici presenc
of mind to hold hi breath and as hi right hand prepar as he wa
for everi chanc held hi knife open he rapidli rip up the sack
extric hi arm and then hi bodi but in spite of all hi effort
to free himself from the shot he felt it drag him down still
lower he then bent hi bodi and by a desper effort sever the
cord that bound hi leg at the moment when it seem as if he were
actual strangl with a mighti leap he rose to the surfac of the
sea while the shot drag down to the depth the sack that had so
nearli becom hi shroud
dant wait onli to get breath and then dive in order to avoid
be seen when he aros a second time he wa fifti pace from where
he had first sunk he saw overhead a black and tempestu sky across
which the wind wa drive cloud that occasion suffer a
twinkl star to appear befor him wa the vast expans of water
sombr and terribl whose wave foam and roar as if befor the
approach of a storm behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the
sky rose phantomlik the vast stone structur whose project crag
seem like arm extend to seiz their prei and on the highest rock
wa a torch light two figur
he fanci that these two form were look at the sea doubtless
these strang gravedigg had heard hi cry dant dive again and
remain a long time beneath the water thi wa an easi feat to him
for he usual attract a crowd of spectat in the bai befor the
lighthous at marseil when he swam there and wa unanim
declar to be the best swimmer in the port when he came up again the
light had disappear
he must now get hi bear ratonneau and pomgu ar the nearest
island of all those that surround the chteau dif but ratonneau and
pomgu ar inhabit as is also the islet of daum tiboulen and
lemair were therefor the safest for dant ventur the island of
tiboulen and lemair ar a leagu from the chteau dif dant
nevertheless determin to make for them but how could he find hi
wai in the dark of the night
at thi moment he saw the light of planier gleam in front of him
like a star by leav thi light on the right he kept the island of
tiboulen a littl on the left by turn to the left therefor he
would find it but as we have said it wa at least a leagu from the
chteau dif to thi island often in prison faria had said to him
when he saw him idl and inact
dant you must not give wai to thi listless you will be
drown if you seek to escap and your strength ha not been properli
exercis and prepar for exert
these word rang in dant ear even beneath the wave he hasten
to cleav hi wai through them to see if he had not lost hi strength
he found with pleasur that hi captiv had taken awai noth of hi
power and that he wa still master of that element on whose bosom he
had so often sport as a boi
fear that relentless pursuer clog dant effort he listen for
ani sound that might be audibl and everi time that he rose to the top
of a wave he scan the horizon and strove to penetr the dark
he fanci that everi wave behind him wa a pursu boat and he
redoubl hi exert increas rapidli hi distanc from the
chteau but exhaust hi strength he swam on still and alreadi the
terribl chteau had disappear in the dark he could not see it
but he felt it presenc
an hour pass dure which dant excit by the feel of freedom
continu to cleav the wave
let us see said he i have swum abov an hour but as the wind is
against me that ha retard my speed howev if i am not mistaken
i must be close to tiboulen but what if i were mistaken
a shudder pass over him he sought to tread water in order to rest
himself but the sea wa too violent and he felt that he could not
make us of thi mean of recuper
well said he i will swim on until i am worn out or the cramp
seiz me and then i shall sink and he struck out with the energi of
despair
suddenli the sky seem to him to becom still darker and more dens
and heavi cloud seem to sweep down toward him at the same time he
felt a sharp pain in hi knee he fanci for a moment that he had been
shot and listen for the report but he heard noth then he put
out hi hand and encount an obstacl and with anoth stroke knew
that he had gain the shore
befor him rose a grotesqu mass of rock that resembl noth so
much as a vast fire petrifi at the moment of it most fervent
combust it wa the island of tiboulen dant rose advanc a few
step and with a fervent prayer of gratitud stretch himself on
the granit which seem to him softer than down then in spite of
the wind and rain he fell into the deep sweet sleep of utter
exhaust at the expir of an hour edmond wa awaken by the
roar of thunder the tempest wa let loos and beat the atmospher
with it mighti wing from time to time a flash of lightn stretch
across the heaven like a fieri serpent light up the cloud that
roll on in vast chaotic wave
dant had not been deceivedh had reach the first of the two
island which wa in fact tiboulen he knew that it wa barren and
without shelter but when the sea becam more calm he resolv to
plung into it wave again and swim to lemair equal arid but
larger and consequ better adapt for conceal
an overhang rock offer him a temporari shelter and scarc had
he avail himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all it furi
edmond felt the trembl of the rock beneath which he lai the wave
dash themselv against it wet him with their sprai he wa
safe shelter and yet he felt dizzi in the midst of the war of
the element and the dazzl bright of the lightn it seem to
him that the island trembl to it base and that it would like a
vessel at anchor break moor and bear him off into the centr of
the storm
he then recollect that he had not eaten or drunk for fourandtwenti
hour he extend hi hand and drank greedili of the rainwat that
had lodg in a hollow of the rock
as he rose a flash of lightn that seem to rive the remotest
height of heaven illumin the dark by it light between the
island of lemair and cape croisel a quarter of a leagu distant
dant saw a fishingboat driven rapidli like a spectr befor the
power of wind and wave a second after he saw it again approach
with fright rapid dant cri at the top of hi voic to warn
them of their danger but thei saw it themselv anoth flash show
him four men cling to the shatter mast and the rig while a
fifth clung to the broken rudder the men he beheld saw him
undoubtedli for their cri were carri to hi ear by the wind
abov the splinter mast a sail rent to tatter wa wave suddenli
the rope that still held it gave wai and it disappear in the
dark of the night like a vast seabird
at the same moment a violent crash wa heard and cri of distress
dant from hi rocki perch saw the shatter vessel and among the
fragment the float form of the hapless sailor then all wa dark
again
dant ran down the rock at the risk of be himself dash to
piec he listen he grope about but he heard and saw nothingth
cri had ceas and the tempest continu to rage by degre the
wind abat vast grai cloud roll toward the west and the blue
firmament appear stud with bright star soon a red streak becam
visibl in the horizon the wave whiten a light plai over them
and gild their foam crest with gold it wa dai
dant stood mute and motionless befor thi majest spectacl as if
he now beheld it for the first time and inde sinc hi captiv in
the chteau dif he had forgotten that such scene were ever to be
wit he turn toward the fortress and look at both sea and
land the gloomi build rose from the bosom of the ocean with
impos majesti and seem to domin the scene it wa about five
oclock the sea continu to get calmer
in two or three hour thought dant the turnkei will enter my
chamber find the bodi of my poor friend recogn it seek for me in
vain and give the alarm then the tunnel will be discov the men
who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry i utter
will be question then boat fill with arm soldier will pursu
the wretch fugit the cannon will warn everyon to refus shelter
to a man wander about nake and famish the polic of marseil
will be on the alert by land whilst the governor pursu me by sea i
am cold i am hungri i have lost even the knife that save me oh my
god i have suffer enough sure have piti on me and do for me what
i am unabl to do for myself
as dant hi ey turn in the direct of the chteau dif
utter thi prayer he saw off the farther point of the island of
pomgu a small vessel with lateen sail skim the sea like a gull in
search of prei and with hi sailor ey he knew it to be a genoes
tartan she wa come out of marseil harbor and wa stand out
to sea rapidli her sharp prow cleav through the wave
oh cri edmond to think that in half an hour i could join her
did i not fear be question detect and convei back to
marseil what can i do what stori can i invent under pretext of
trade along the coast these men who ar in realiti smuggler will
prefer sell me to do a good action i must wait but i cannoti
am starv in a few hour my strength will be utterli exhaust
besid perhap i have not been miss at the fortress i can pass as
on of the sailor wreck last night my stori will be accept for
there is no on left to contradict me
as he spoke dant look toward the spot where the fishingvessel had
been wreck and start the red cap of on of the sailor hung to a
point of the rock and some timber that had form part of the vessel
keel float at the foot of the crag in an instant dant plan wa
form he swam to the cap place it on hi head seiz on of the
timber and struck out so as to cut across the cours the vessel wa
take
i am save murmur he and thi convict restor hi strength
he soon saw that the vessel with the wind dead ahead wa tack
between the chteau dif and the tower of planier for an instant he
fear lest instead of keep in shore she should stand out to sea
but he soon saw that she would pass like most vessel bound for itali
between the island of jaro and calaseraign
howev the vessel and the swimmer insens near on anoth and
in on of it tack the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of
him he rose on the wave make sign of distress but no on on
board saw him and the vessel stood on anoth tack dant would have
shout but he knew that the wind would drown hi voic
it wa then he rejoic at hi precaut in take the timber for
without it he would have been unabl perhap to reach the
vesselcertainli to return to shore should he be unsuccess in
attract attent
dant though almost sure as to what cours the vessel would take had
yet watch it anxious until it tack and stood toward him then he
advanc but befor thei could meet the vessel again chang her
cours by a violent effort he rose half out of the water wave hi
cap and utter a loud shout peculiar to sailor thi time he wa
both seen and heard and the tartan instantli steer toward him at
the same time he saw thei were about to lower the boat
an instant after the boat row by two men advanc rapidli toward
him dant let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless
and swam vigor to meet them but he had reckon too much upon hi
strength and then he realiz how servic the timber had been to
him hi arm becam stiff hi leg lost their flexibl and he wa
almost breathless
he shout again the two sailor redoubl their effort and on of
them cri in italian courag
the word reach hi ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength
to surmount pass over hi head he rose again to the surfac
struggl with the last desper effort of a drown man utter a
third cry and felt himself sink as if the fatal cannon shot were
again ti to hi feet the water pass over hi head and the sky
turn grai a convuls movement again brought him to the surfac he
felt himself seiz by the hair then he saw and heard noth he had
faint
when he open hi ey dant found himself on the deck of the tartan
hi first care wa to see what cours thei were take thei were
rapidli leav the chteau dif behind dant wa so exhaust that
the exclam of joi he utter wa mistaken for a sigh

chapter 22 the smuggler
dant had not been a dai on board befor he had a veri clear idea of
the men with whom hi lot had been cast without have been in the
school of the abb faria the worthi master of la jeun amli the
name of the genoes tartan knew a smatter of all the tongu spoken
on the shore of that larg lake call the mediterranean from the
arab to the proven and thi while it spare him interpret
person alwai troublesom and frequent indiscreet gave him great
facil of commun either with the vessel he met at sea
with the small boat sail along the coast or with the peopl
without name countri or occup who ar alwai seen on the quai
of seaport and who live by hidden and mysteri mean which we must
suppos to be a direct gift of provid as thei have no visibl
mean of support it is fair to assum that dant wa on board a
smuggler
at first the captain had receiv dant on board with a certain degre
of distrust he wa veri well known to the custom offic of the
coast and as there wa between these worthi and himself a perpetu
battl of wit he had at first thought that dant might be an
emissari of these industri guardian of right and duti who
perhap emploi thi ingeni mean of learn some of the secret
of hi trade but the skil manner in which dant had handl the
lugger had entir reassur him and then when he saw the light
plume of smoke float abov the bastion of the chteau dif and
heard the distant report he wa instantli struck with the idea that he
had on board hi vessel on whose come and go like that of king
wa accompani with salut of artilleri thi made him less uneasi
it must be own than if the newcom had prove to be a custom
offic but thi supposit also disappear like the first when he
beheld the perfect tranquil of hi recruit
edmond thu had the advantag of know what the owner wa without
the owner know who he wa and howev the old sailor and hi crew
tri to pump him thei extract noth more from him he gave
accur descript of napl and malta which he knew as well as
marseil and held stoutli to hi first stori thu the genoes
subtl as he wa wa dupe by edmond in whose favor hi mild
demeanor hi nautic skill and hi admir dissimul plead
moreov it is possibl that the genoes wa on of those shrewd
person who know noth but what thei should know and believ noth
but what thei should believ
in thi state of mutual understand thei reach leghorn here
edmond wa to undergo anoth trial he wa to find out whether he
could recogn himself as he had not seen hi own face for fourteen
year he had preserv a toler good remembr of what the youth
had been and wa now to find out what the man had becom hi comrad
believ that hi vow wa fulfil as he had twenti time touch at
leghorn he rememb a barber in st ferdinand street he went there
to have hi beard and hair cut the barber gaze in amaz at thi
man with the long thick and black hair and beard which gave hi head
the appear of on of titian portrait at thi period it wa not
the fashion to wear so larg a beard and hair so long now a barber
would onli be surpris if a man gift with such advantag should
consent voluntarili to depriv himself of them the leghorn barber said
noth and went to work
when the oper wa conclud and edmond felt that hi chin wa
complet smooth and hi hair reduc to it usual length he ask
for a lookingglass he wa now as we have said threeandthirti
year of ag and hi fourteen year imprison had produc a great
transform in hi appear
dant had enter the chteau dif with the round open smile face
of a young and happi man with whom the earli path of life have been
smooth and who anticip a futur correspond with hi past thi
wa now all chang the oval face wa lengthen hi smile mouth
had assum the firm and mark line which betoken resolut hi
eyebrow were arch beneath a brow furrow with thought hi ey
were full of melancholi and from their depth occasion sparkl
gloomi fire of misanthropi and hatr hi complexion so long kept
from the sun had now that pale color which produc when the featur
ar encircl with black hair the aristocrat beauti of the man of
the north the profound learn he had acquir had besid diffus
over hi featur a refin intellectu express and he had also
acquir be natur of a goodli statur that vigor which a frame
possess which ha so long concentr all it forc within itself
0283m
to the eleg of a nervou and slight form had succeed the solid
of a round and muscular figur as to hi voic prayer sob and
imprec had chang it so that at time it wa of a singularli
penetr sweet and at other rough and almost hoars
moreov from be so long in twilight or dark hi ey had
acquir the faculti of distinguish object in the night common to
the hyena and the wolf edmond smile when he beheld himself it wa
imposs that hi best friendif inde he had ani friend

the master of la jeun amli who wa veri desir of retain
amongst hi crew a man of edmond valu had offer to advanc him
fund out of hi futur profit which edmond had accept hi next
care on leav the barber who had achiev hi first metamorphosi
wa to enter a shop and bui a complet sailor suita garb as we all
know veri simpl and consist of white trouser a stripe shirt
and a cap
it wa in thi costum and bring back to jacopo the shirt and
trouser he had lent him that edmond reappear befor the captain of
the lugger who had made him tell hi stori over and over again befor
he could believ him or recogn in the neat and trim sailor the man
with thick and mat beard hair tangl with seawe and bodi
soak in seabrin whom he had pick up nake and nearli drown
attract by hi prepossess appear he renew hi offer of an
engag to dant but dant who had hi own project would not
agre for a longer time than three month
la jeun amli had a veri activ crew veri obedi to their
captain who lost as littl time as possibl he had scarc been a
week at leghorn befor the hold of hi vessel wa fill with print
muslin contraband cotton english powder and tobacco on which the
excis had forgotten to put it mark the master wa to get all thi
out of leghorn free of duti and land it on the shore of corsica
where certain specul undertook to forward the cargo to franc
thei sail edmond wa again cleav the azur sea which had been the
first horizon of hi youth and which he had so often dream of in
prison he left gorgon on hi right and la pianosa on hi left and
went toward the countri of paoli and napoleon
the next morn go on deck as he alwai did at an earli hour the
patron found dant lean against the bulwark gaze with intens
earnest at a pile of granit rock which the rise sun ting
with rosi light it wa the island of mont cristo
la jeun amli left it threequart of a leagu to the larboard
and kept on for corsica dant thought as thei pass so close to
the island whose name wa so interest to him that he had onli to
leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promis land but then
what could he do without instrument to discov hi treasur without
arm to defend himself besid what would the sailor sai what would
the patron think he must wait
fortun dant had learn how to wait he had wait fourteen
year for hi liberti and now he wa free he could wait at least six
month or a year for wealth would he not have accept liberti without
rich if it had been offer to him besid were not those rich
chimericaloffspr of the brain of the poor abb faria had thei not
di with him it is true the letter of the cardin spada wa
singularli circumstanti and dant repeat it to himself from on
end to the other for he had not forgotten a word
0285m
even came and edmond saw the island ting with the shade of
twilight and then disappear in the dark from all ey but hi own
for he with vision accustom to the gloom of a prison continu to
behold it last of all for he remain alon upon deck the next morn
broke off the coast of aleria all dai thei coast and in the even
saw fire light on land the posit of these wa no doubt a signal
for land for a ship lantern wa hung up at the masthead instead
of the streamer and thei came to within a gunshot of the shore dant
notic that the captain of la jeun amli had as he near the
land mount two small culverin which without make much nois
can throw a four ounc ball a thousand pace or so
but on thi occas the precaut wa superflu and everyth
proceed with the utmost smooth and polit four shallop came
off with veri littl nois alongsid the lugger which no doubt in
acknowledg of the compliment lower her own shallop into the
sea and the five boat work so well that by two oclock in the
morn all the cargo wa out of la jeun amli and on terra
firma the same night such a man of regular wa the patron of la
jeun amli the profit were divid and each man had a hundr
tuscan livr or about eighti franc
but the voyag wa not end thei turn the bowsprit toward
sardinia where thei intend to take in a cargo which wa to replac
what had been discharg the second oper wa as success as the
first la jeun amli wa in luck thi new cargo wa destin for
the coast of the duchi of lucca and consist almost entir of
havana cigar sherri and malaga wine
there thei had a bit of a skirmish in get rid of the duti the
excis wa in truth the everlast enemi of the patron of la jeun
amli a custom offic wa laid low and two sailor wound
dant wa on of the latter a ball have touch him in the left
shoulder dant wa almost glad of thi affrai and almost pleas at
be wound for thei were rude lesson which taught him with what
ey he could view danger and with what endur he could bear
suffer he had contempl danger with a smile and when wound
had exclaim with the great philosoph pain thou art not an evil
he had moreov look upon the custom offic wound to death
and whether from heat of blood produc by the encount or the chill
of human sentiment thi sight had made but slight impress upon him
dant wa on the wai he desir to follow and wa move toward the
end he wish to achiev hi heart wa in a fair wai of petrifi in
hi bosom jacopo see him fall had believ him kill and
rush toward him rais him up and then attend to him with all
the kind of a devot comrad
thi world wa not then so good as doctor pangloss believ it neither
wa it so wick as dant thought it sinc thi man who had noth
to expect from hi comrad but the inherit of hi share of the
prizemonei manifest so much sorrow when he saw him fall
fortun as we have said edmond wa onli wound and with certain
herb gather at certain season and sold to the smuggler by the old
sardinian women the wound soon close edmond then resolv to try
jacopo and offer him in return for hi attent a share of hi
prizemonei but jacopo refus it indignantli
as a result of the sympathet devot which jacopo had from the first
bestow on edmond the latter wa move to a certain degre of
affect but thi suffic for jacopo who instinct felt that
edmond had a right to superior of positiona superior which
edmond had conceal from all other and from thi time the kind
which edmond show him wa enough for the brave seaman
then in the long dai on board ship when the vessel glide on with
secur over the azur sea requir no care but the hand of the
helmsman thank to the favor wind that swell her sail edmond
with a chart in hi hand becam the instructor of jacopo as the poor
abb faria had been hi tutor he point out to him the bear of
the coast explain to him the variat of the compass and taught
him to read in that vast book open over our head which thei call
heaven and where god write in azur with letter of diamond
and when jacopo inquir of him what is the us of teach all these
thing to a poor sailor like me edmond repli who know you mai
on dai be the captain of a vessel your fellowcountryman bonapart
becam emperor we had forgotten to sai that jacopo wa a corsican
two month and a half elaps in these trip and edmond had becom as
skil a coaster as he had been a hardi seaman he had form an
acquaint with all the smuggler on the coast and learn all the
mason sign by which these half pirat recogn each other he had
pass and repass hi island of mont cristo twenti time but not
onc had he found an opportun of land there
he then form a resolut as soon as hi engag with the patron
of la jeun amli end he would hire a small vessel on hi own
accountfor in hi sever voyag he had amass a hundr
piastresand under some pretext land at the island of mont cristo
then he would be free to make hi research not perhap entir at
liberti for he would be doubtless watch by those who accompani
him but in thi world we must risk someth prison had made edmond
prudent and he wa desir of run no risk whatev but in vain
did he rack hi imagin fertil as it wa he could not devis ani
plan for reach the island without companionship
dant wa toss about on these doubt and wish when the patron
who had great confid in him and wa veri desir of retain him
in hi servic took him by the arm on even and led him to a tavern
on the via del oglio where the lead smuggler of leghorn us to
congreg and discuss affair connect with their trade alreadi
dant had visit thi maritim bours two or three time and see
all these hardi freetrad who suppli the whole coast for nearli
two hundr leagu in extent he had ask himself what power might
not that man attain who should give the impuls of hi will to all
these contrari and diverg mind thi time it wa a great matter
that wa under discuss connect with a vessel laden with turkei
carpet stuff of the levant and cashmer it wa necessari to find
some neutral ground on which an exchang could be made and then to try
and land these good on the coast of franc if the ventur wa
success the profit would be enorm there would be a gain of fifti
or sixti piastr each for the crew
the patron of la jeun amli propos as a place of land the
island of mont cristo which be complet desert and have
neither soldier nor revenu offic seem to have been place in
the midst of the ocean sinc the time of the heathen olympu by
mercuri the god of merchant and robber class of mankind which we
in modern time have separ if not made distinct but which
antiqu appear to have includ in the same categori
at the mention of mont cristo dant start with joi he rose to
conceal hi emot and took a turn around the smoki tavern where all
the languag of the known world were jumbl in a lingua franca
when he again join the two person who had been discuss the
matter it had been decid that thei should touch at mont cristo and
set out on the follow night edmond be consult wa of opinion
that the island afford everi possibl secur and that great
enterpris to be well done should be done quickli
noth then wa alter in the plan and order were given to get
under weigh next night and wind and weather permit to make the
neutral island by the follow dai

ani suspicion on night more and he would be on hi wai
the night wa on of feverish distract and in it progress vision
good and evil pass through dant mind if he close hi ey he
saw cardin spada letter written on the wall in charact of

the roof glow with diamond stalactit pearl fell drop by drop as
subterranean water filter in their cave edmond amaz
wonderstruck fill hi pocket with the radiant gem and then
return to daylight when he discov that hi prize had all

marvel grotto but thei had suddenli reced and now the path
becam a labyrinth and then the entranc vanish and in vain did he
tax hi memori for the magic and mysteri word which open the
splendid cavern of ali baba to the arabian fisherman all wa useless
the treasur disappear and had again revert to the genii from whom
for a moment he had hope to carri it off
the dai came at length and wa almost as feverish as the night had
been but it brought reason to the aid of imagin and dant wa
then enabl to arrang a plan which had hitherto been vagu and
unsettl in hi brain night came and with it the prepar for

he had by degre assum such author over hi companion that he
wa almost like a command on board and as hi order were alwai
clear distinct and easi of execut hi comrad obei him with
celer and pleasur
the old patron did not interfer for he too had recogn the
superior of dant over the crew and himself he saw in the young
man hi natur successor and regret that he had not a daughter
that he might have bound edmond to him by a more secur allianc at
seven oclock in the even all wa readi and at ten minut past
seven thei doubl the lighthous just as the beacon wa kindl the

so thei call dant had said thi it wa suffici and all went
to their bunk contentedli
thi frequent happen dant cast from solitud into the world

solitud is more complet or more poetic than that of a ship

resign the lugger to the master care and went and lai down in hi
hammock but in spite of a sleepless night he could not close hi
ey for a moment
two hour afterward he came on deck as the boat wa about to doubl
the island of elba thei were just abreast of mareciana and beyond the
flat but verdant island of la pianosa the peak of mont cristo
redden by the burn sun wa seen against the azur sky dant
order the helmsman to put down hi helm in order to leav la pianosa
to starboard as he knew that he should shorten hi cours by two or
three knot about five oclock in the even the island wa distinct
and everyth on it wa plainli percept ow to that clear
of the atmospher peculiar to the light which the rai of the sun cast
at it set
edmond gaze veri earnestli at the mass of rock which gave out all the
varieti of twilight color from the brightest pink to the deepest
blue and from time to time hi cheek flush hi brow darken and
a mist pass over hi ey never did a gamest whose whole fortun
is stake on on cast of the die experi the anguish which edmond
felt in hi paroxysm of hope
night came and at ten oclock thei anchor la jeun amli wa
first at the rendezv in spite of hi usual command over himself
dant could not restrain hi impetuos he wa the first to jump on
shore and had he dare he would like luciu brutu have kiss hi
mother earth it wa dark but at eleven oclock the moon rose in the
midst of the ocean whose everi wave she silver and then ascend
high plai in flood of pale light on the rocki hill of thi second
pelion
the island wa familiar to the crew of la jeun amlieit wa on of
her regular haunt as to dant he had pass it on hi voyag to and
from the levant but never touch at it he question jacopo
where shall we pass the night he inquir
why on board the tartan repli the sailor
should we not do better in the grotto
what grotto
why the grottoscav of the island
i do not know of ani grotto repli jacopo
the cold sweat sprang forth on dant brow
what ar there no grotto at mont cristo he ask
none
for a moment dant wa speechless then he rememb that these cave
might have been fill up by some accid or even stop up for the
sake of greater secur by cardin spada the point wa then to
discov the hidden entranc it wa useless to search at night and
dant therefor delai all investig until the morn besid
a signal made half a leagu out at sea and to which la jeun amli
repli by a similar signal indic that the moment for busi had
come
the boat that now arriv assur by the answer signal that all wa
well soon came in sight white and silent as a phantom and cast
anchor within a cabl length of shore
then the land began dant reflect as he work on the shout of
joi which with a singl word he could evok from all these men if he
gave utter to the on unchang thought that pervad hi heart
but far from disclos thi preciou secret he almost fear that he
had alreadi said too much and by hi restless and continu
question hi minut observ and evid preoccup arous
suspicion fortun as regard thi circumst at least hi
pain past gave to hi counten an indel sad and the
glimmer of gayeti seen beneath thi cloud were inde but
transitori
no on had the slightest suspicion and when next dai take a
fowlingpiec powder and shot dant declar hi intent to go
and kill some of the wild goat that were seen spring from rock to
rock hi wish wa constru into a love of sport or a desir for
solitud howev jacopo insist on follow him and dant did not
oppos thi fear if he did so that he might incur distrust
scarc howev had thei gone a quarter of a leagu when have
kill a kid he beg jacopo to take it to hi comrad and request
them to cook it and when readi to let him know by fire a gun thi
and some dri fruit and a flask of mont pulciano wa the bill of
fare
dant went on look from time to time behind and around about him
have reach the summit of a rock he saw a thousand feet beneath
him hi companion whom jacopo had rejoin and who were all busi
prepar the repast which edmond skill as a marksman had augment
with a capit dish
edmond look at them for a moment with the sad and gentl smile of a
man superior to hi fellow
in two hour time said he these person will depart richer by
fifti piastr each to go and risk their live again by endeavor to
gain fifti more then thei will return with a fortun of six hundr
franc and wast thi treasur in some citi with the pride of sultan
and the insol of nabob at thi moment hope make me despis their
rich which seem to me contempt yet perchanc tomorrow decept
will so act on me that i shall on compuls consid such a
contempt possess as the utmost happi oh no exclaim
edmond that will not be the wise uner faria could not be
mistaken in thi on thing besid it were better to die than to
continu to lead thi low and wretch life
thu dant who but three month befor had no desir but liberti had
now not liberti enough and pant for wealth the caus wa not in
dant but in provid who while limit the power of man ha
fill him with boundless desir
meanwhil by a cleft between two wall of rock follow a path worn
by a torrent and which in all human probabl human foot had never
befor trod dant approach the spot where he suppos the grotto
must have exist keep along the shore and examin the smallest
object with seriou attent he thought he could trace on certain
rock mark made by the hand of man
time which encrust all physic substanc with it mossi mantl as
it invest all thing of the mind with forget seem to have
respect these sign which appar had been made with some degre
of regular and probabl with a definit purpos occasion the
mark were hidden under tuft of myrtl which spread into larg bush
laden with blossom or beneath parasit lichen so edmond had to
separ the branch or brush awai the moss to know where the
guidemark were the sight of mark renew edmond fondest hope
might it not have been the cardin himself who had first trace them
in order that thei might serv as a guid for hi nephew in the event
of a catastroph which he could not forese would have been so
complet thi solitari place wa precis suit to the requir
of a man desir of buri treasur onli might not these betrai
mark have attract other ey than those for whom thei were made and
had the dark and wondrou island inde faithfulli guard it preciou
secret
0295m
it seem howev to edmond who wa hidden from hi comrad by the
inequ of the ground that at sixti pace from the harbor the
mark ceas nor did thei termin at ani grotto a larg round rock
place solidli on it base wa the onli spot to which thei seem to
lead edmond conclud that perhap instead of have reach the end
of the rout he had onli explor it begin and he therefor
turn round and retrac hi step
meanwhil hi comrad had prepar the repast had got some water from
a spring spread out the fruit and bread and cook the kid just at
the moment when thei were take the dainti anim from the spit thei
saw edmond spring with the bold of a chamoi from rock to rock
and thei fire the signal agre upon the sportsman instantli chang
hi direct and ran quickli toward them but even while thei
watch hi dare progress edmond foot slip and thei saw him
stagger on the edg of a rock and disappear thei all rush toward
him for all love edmond in spite of hi superior yet jacopo
reach him first
he found edmond ly prone bleed and almost senseless he had
roll down a decliv of twelv or fifteen feet thei pour a littl
rum down hi throat and thi remedi which had befor been so
benefici to him produc the same effect as formerli edmond open
hi ey complain of great pain in hi knee a feel of heavi
in hi head and sever pain in hi loin thei wish to carri him to
the shore but when thei touch him although under jacopo
direct he declar with heavi groan that he could not bear to
be move
it mai be suppos that dant did not now think of hi dinner but he
insist that hi comrad who had not hi reason for fast should
have their meal as for himself he declar that he had onli need of a
littl rest and that when thei return he should be easier the
sailor did not requir much urg thei were hungri and the smell of
the roast kid wa veri savori and your tar ar not veri
ceremoni an hour afterward thei return all that edmond had been
abl to do wa to drag himself about a dozen pace forward to lean
against a mossgrown rock
but instead of grow easier dant pain appear to increas in
violenc the old patron who wa oblig to sail in the morn in
order to land hi cargo on the frontier of piedmont and franc
between nice and frju urg dant to try and rise edmond made
great exert in order to compli but at each effort he fell back
moan and turn pale
he ha broken hi rib said the command in a low voic no
matter he is an excel fellow and we must not leav him we will
try and carri him on board the tartan
dant declar howev that he would rather die where he wa than
undergo the agoni which the slightest movement cost him
well said the patron let what mai happen it shall never be said
that we desert a good comrad like you we will not go till even
thi veri much astonish the sailor although not on oppos it
the patron wa so strict that thi wa the first time thei had ever
seen him give up an enterpris or even delai in it execut dant
would not allow that ani such infract of regular and proper rule
should be made in hi favor
no no he said to the patron i wa awkward and it is just that i
pai the penalti of my clumsi leav me a small suppli of biscuit a
gun powder and ball to kill the kid or defend myself at need and
a pickax that i mai build a shelter if you delai in come back for
me
but youll die of hunger said the patron
i would rather do so wa edmond repli than suffer the
inexpress agoni which the slightest movement caus me
the patron turn toward hi vessel which wa roll on the swell in
the littl harbor and with sail partli set would be readi for sea
when her toilet should be complet
what ar we to do maltes ask the captain we cannot leav you
here so and yet we cannot stai
go go exclaim dant
we shall be absent at least a week said the patron and then we
must run out of our cours to come here and take you up again
why said dant if in two or three dai you hail ani fishingboat
desir them to come here to me i will pai twentyf piastr for my
passag back to leghorn if you do not come across on return for me
the patron shook hi head
listen captain baldi there on wai of settl thi said jacopo
do you go and i will stai and take care of the wound man
and give up your share of the ventur said edmond to remain with
me
ye said jacopo and without ani hesit
you ar a good fellow and a kindheart messmat repli edmond
and heaven will recompens you for your gener intent but i do
not wish anyon to stai with me a dai or two of rest will set me up
and i hope i shall find among the rock certain herb most excel
for bruis
a peculiar smile pass over dant lip he squeez jacopo hand
warmli but noth could shake hi determin to remainand remain
alon
the smuggler left with edmond what he had request and set sail but
not without turn about sever time and each time make sign of
a cordial farewel to which edmond repli with hi hand onli as if
he could not move the rest of hi bodi
then when thei had disappear he said with a smileti strang
that it should be among such men that we find proof of friendship and
devot then he drag himself cautious to the top of a rock
from which he had a full view of the sea and thenc he saw the tartan
complet her prepar for sail weigh anchor and balanc
herself as gracefulli as a waterfowl er it take to the wing set
sail
at the end of an hour she wa complet out of sight at least it wa
imposs for the wound man to see her ani longer from the spot
where he wa then dant rose more agil and light than the kid among
the myrtl and shrub of these wild rock took hi gun in on hand
hi pickax in the other and hasten toward the rock on which the
mark he had note termin
and now he exclaim rememb the tale of the arabian fisherman
which faria had relat to him now open sesam
chapter 24 the secret cave
the sun had nearli reach the meridian and hi scorch rai fell
full on the rock which seem themselv sensibl of the heat
thousand of grasshopp hidden in the bush chirp with a
monoton and dull note the leav of the myrtl and oliv tree
wave and rustl in the wind at everi step that edmond took he
disturb the lizard glitter with the hue of the emerald afar off
he saw the wild goat bound from crag to crag in a word the island
wa inhabit yet edmond felt himself alon guid by the hand of
god
he felt an indescrib sensat somewhat akin to dreadthat dread of
the daylight which even in the desert make us fear we ar watch and
observ thi feel wa so strong that at the moment when edmond wa
about to begin hi labor he stop laid down hi pickax seiz hi
gun mount to the summit of the highest rock and from thenc gaze
round in everi direct
but it wa not upon corsica the veri hous of which he could
distinguish or on sardinia or on the island of elba with it
histor associ or upon the almost impercept line that to
the experienc ey of a sailor alon reveal the coast of genoa the
proud and leghorn the commerci that he gaze it wa at the
brigantin that had left in the morn and the tartan that had just
set sail that edmond fix hi ey
the first wa just disappear in the strait of bonifacio the other
follow an opposit direct wa about to round the island of
corsica
thi sight reassur him he then look at the object near him he
saw that he wa on the highest point of the islanda statu on thi
vast pedest of granit noth human appear in sight while the
blue ocean beat against the base of the island and cover it with a
fring of foam then he descend with cautiou and slow step for he
dread lest an accid similar to that he had so adroitli feign
should happen in realiti
dant as we have said had trace the mark along the rock and he
had notic that thei led to a small creek which wa hidden like the
bath of some ancient nymph thi creek wa suffici wide at it
mouth and deep in the centr to admit of the entranc of a small
vessel of the lugger class which would be perfectli conceal from
observ
then follow the clew that in the hand of the abb faria had been
so skilfulli us to guid him through the ddalian labyrinth of
probabl he thought that the cardin spada anxiou not to be
watch had enter the creek conceal hi littl barqu follow
the line mark by the notch in the rock and at the end of it had
buri hi treasur it wa thi idea that had brought dant back to
the circular rock on thing onli perplex edmond and destroi hi
theori how could thi rock which weigh sever ton have been
lift to thi spot without the aid of mani men
suddenli an idea flash across hi mind instead of rais it
thought he thei have lower it and he sprang from the rock in order
to inspect the base on which it had formerli stood
he soon perceiv that a slope had been form and the rock had slid
along thi until it stop at the spot it now occupi a larg stone
had serv as a wedg flint and pebbl had been insert around it
so as to conceal the orific thi speci of masonri had been cover
with earth and grass and weed had grown there moss had clung to the
stone myrtlebush had taken root and the old rock seem fix to
the earth
0301m
dant dug awai the earth carefulli and detect or fanci he
detect the ingeni artific he attack thi wall cement by
the hand of time with hi pickax after ten minut labor the wall
gave wai and a hole larg enough to insert the arm wa open
dant went and cut the strongest olivetre he could find strip
off it branch insert it in the hole and us it as a lever but
the rock wa too heavi and too firmli wedg to be move by anyon
man were he hercul himself dant saw that he must attack the
wedg but how
he cast hi ey around and saw the horn full of powder which hi
friend jacopo had left him he smile the infern invent would
serv him for thi purpos
with the aid of hi pickax dant after the manner of a laborsav
pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the on that support
it fill it with powder then made a match by roll hi
handkerchief in saltpetr he light it and retir
the explos soon follow the upper rock wa lift from it base by
the terrif forc of the powder the lower on flew into piec
thousand of insect escap from the apertur dant had previous
form and a huge snake like the guardian demon of the treasur
roll himself along in darken coil and disappear
dant approach the upper rock which now without ani support
lean toward the sea the intrepid treasureseek walk round it
and select the spot from whenc it appear most suscept to
attack place hi lever in on of the crevic and strain everi
nerv to move the mass
the rock alreadi shaken by the explos totter on it base dant
redoubl hi effort he seem like on of the ancient titan who
uproot the mountain to hurl against the father of the god the rock
yield roll over bound from point to point and final
disappear in the ocean
on the spot it had occupi wa a circular space expos an iron ring
let into a squar flagston
dant utter a cry of joi and surpris never had a first attempt
been crown with more perfect success he would fain have continu
but hi knee trembl and hi heart beat so violent and hi sight
becam so dim that he wa forc to paus
thi feel last but for a moment edmond insert hi lever in the
ring and exert all hi strength the flagston yield and
disclos step that descend until thei were lost in the obscur of
a subterran grotto
anyon els would have rush on with a cry of joi dant turn pale
hesit and reflect
come said he to himself be a man i am accustom to advers i
must not be cast down by the discoveri that i have been deceiv what
then would be the us of all i have suffer the heart break when
after have been elat by flatter hope it see all it illus
destroi faria ha dream thi the cardin spada buri no
treasur here perhap he never came here or if he did csar borgia
the intrepid adventur the stealthi and indefatig plunder ha
follow him discov hi trace pursu them as i have done
rais the stone and descend befor me ha left me noth
he remain motionless and pensiv hi ey fix on the gloomi
apertur that wa open at hi feet
now that i expect noth now that i no longer entertain the
slightest hope the end of thi adventur becom simpli a matter of
curios and he remain again motionless and thought
ye ye thi is an adventur worthi a place in the vari career of
that royal bandit thi fabul event form but a link in a long
chain of marvel ye borgia ha been here a torch in on hand a
sword in the other and within twenti pace at the foot of thi rock
perhap two guard kept watch on land and sea while their master
descend as i am about to descend dispel the dark befor hi
aweinspir progress
0303m
but what wa the fate of the guard who thu possess hi secret
ask dant of himself
the fate repli he smile of those who buri alar and were
inter with the corps
yet had he come thought dant he would have found the treasur
and borgia he who compar itali to an artichok which he could
devour leaf by leaf knew too well the valu of time to wast it in
replac thi rock i will go down
then he descend a smile on hi lip and murmur that last word of
human philosophi perhap
but instead of the dark and the thick and mephit atmospher he
had expect to find dant saw a dim and bluish light which as well
as the air enter not mere by the apertur he had just form but
by the interstic and crevic of the rock which were visibl from
without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the
wave branch of the evergreen oak and the tendril of the creeper
that grew from the rock
after have stood a few minut in the cavern the atmospher of which
wa rather warm than damp dant ey habitu as it wa to
dark could pierc even to the remotest angl of the cavern which
wa of granit that sparkl like diamond
ala said edmond smile these ar the treasur the cardin ha
left and the good abb see in a dream these glitter wall ha
indulg in fallaci hope
but he call to mind the word of the will which he knew by heart
in the farthest angl of the second open said the cardin
will he had onli found the first grotto he had now to seek the
second dant continu hi search he reflect that thi second
grotto must penetr deeper into the island he examin the stone
and sound on part of the wall where he fanci the open exist
mask for precaut sake
the pickax struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of
dant forehead larg drop of perspir at last it seem to him
that on part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo he
eagerli advanc and with the quick of percept that no on but
a prison possess saw that there in all probabl the open
must be
howev he like csar borgia knew the valu of time and in order
to avoid fruitless toil he sound all the other wall with hi
pickax struck the earth with the butt of hi gun and find noth
that appear suspici return to that part of the wall whenc
issu the consol sound he had befor heard
he again struck it and with greater forc then a singular thing
occur as he struck the wall piec of stucco similar to that us
in the ground work of arabesqu broke off and fell to the ground in
flake expos a larg white stone the apertur of the rock had been
close with stone then thi stucco had been appli and paint to
imit granit dant struck with the sharp end of hi pickax which
enter somewai between the interstic
it wa there he must dig
but by some strang plai of emot in proport as the proof that
faria had not been deceiv becam stronger so did hi heart give
wai and a feel of discourag stole over him thi last proof
instead of give him fresh strength depriv him of it the pickax
descend or rather fell he place it on the ground pass hi hand
over hi brow and remount the stair alleg to himself as an
excus a desir to be assur that no on wa watch him but in
realiti becaus he felt that he wa about to faint
the island wa desert and the sun seem to cover it with it fieri
glanc afar off a few small fish boat stud the bosom of the
blue ocean
dant had tast noth but he thought not of hunger at such a
moment he hastili swallow a few drop of rum and again enter the
cavern
the pickax that had seem so heavi wa now like a feather in hi
grasp he seiz it and attack the wall after sever blow he
perceiv that the stone were not cement but had been mere place
on upon the other and cover with stucco he insert the point of
hi pickax and us the handl as a lever with joi soon saw the
stone turn as if on hing and fall at hi feet
he had noth more to do now but with the iron tooth of the pickax
to draw the stone toward him on by on the apertur wa alreadi
suffici larg for him to enter but by wait he could still
cling to hope and retard the certainti of decept at last after
renew hesit dant enter the second grotto
the second grotto wa lower and more gloomi than the first the air
that could onli enter by the newli form open had the mephit
smell dant wa surpris not to find in the outer cavern he wait
in order to allow pure air to displac the foul atmospher and then
went on
at the left of the open wa a dark and deep angl but to dant
ey there wa no dark he glanc around thi second grotto it
wa like the first empti
the treasur if it exist wa buri in thi corner the time had at
length arriv two feet of earth remov and dant fate would be
decid
he advanc toward the angl and summon all hi resolut
attack the ground with the pickax at the fifth or sixth blow the
pickax struck against an iron substanc never did funer knell
never did alarmbel produc a greater effect on the hearer had
dant found noth he could not have becom more ghastli pale
he again struck hi pickax into the earth and encount the same
resist but not the same sound
it is a casket of wood bound with iron thought he
at thi moment a shadow pass rapidli befor the open dant
seiz hi gun sprang through the open and mount the stair a
wild goat had pass befor the mouth of the cave and wa feed at a
littl distanc thi would have been a favor occas to secur
hi dinner but dant fear lest the report of hi gun should attract
attent
he thought a moment cut a branch of a resin tree light it at the
fire at which the smuggler had prepar their breakfast and descend
with thi torch
he wish to see everyth he approach the hole he had dug and
now with the aid of the torch saw that hi pickax had in realiti
struck against iron and wood he plant hi torch in the ground and
resum hi labor
in an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad wa clear
and dant could see an oaken coffer bound with cut steel in the
middl of the lid he saw engrav on a silver plate which wa still
untarnish the arm of the spada familyviz a sword en pale on
an oval shield like all the italian armori bear and surmount
by a cardin hat
dant easili recogn them faria had so often drawn them for him
there wa no longer ani doubt the treasur wa thereno on would have
been at such pain to conceal an empti casket in an instant he had
clear everi obstacl awai and he saw success the lock place
between two padlock and the two handl at each end all carv as
thing were carv at that epoch when art render the commonest
metal preciou
dant seiz the handl and strove to lift the coffer it wa
imposs he sought to open it lock and padlock were fasten these
faith guardian seem unwil to surrend their trust dant
insert the sharp end of the pickax between the coffer and the lid
and press with all hi forc on the handl burst open the
fasten the hing yield in their turn and fell still hold in
their grasp fragment of the wood and the chest wa open
0307m
edmond wa seiz with vertigo he cock hi gun and laid it besid
him he then close hi ey as children do in order that thei mai see
in the resplend night of their own imagin more star than ar
visibl in the firmament then he reopen them and stood motionless
with amaz
three compart divid the coffer in the first blaze pile of
golden coin in the second were rang bar of unpolish gold which
possess noth attract save their valu in the third edmond
grasp hand of diamond pearl and rubi which as thei fell
on on anoth sound like hail against glass
after have touch felt examin these treasur edmond rush
through the cavern like a man seiz with frenzi he leap on a rock
from whenc he could behold the sea he wa alonealon with these
countless these unheardof treasur wa he awak or wa it but a
dream wa it a transient vision or wa he face to face with realiti
he would fain have gaze upon hi gold and yet he had not strength
enough for an instant he lean hi head in hi hand as if to prevent
hi sens from leav him and then rush madli about the rock of
mont cristo terrifi the wild goat and scare the seafowl with
hi wild cri and gestur then he return and still unabl to
believ the evid of hi sens rush into the grotto and found
himself befor thi mine of gold and jewel
thi time he fell on hi knee and clasp hi hand convuls
utter a prayer intellig to god alon he soon becam calmer and
more happi for onli now did he begin to realiz hi felic
he then set himself to work to count hi fortun there were a thousand
ingot of gold each weigh from two to three pound then he pile
up twentyf thousand crown each worth about eighti franc of our
monei and bear the effigi of alexand vi and hi predecessor
and he saw that the complement wa not half empti and he measur ten
doubl hand of pearl diamond and other gem mani of which
mount by the most famou workmen were valuabl beyond their
intrins worth
dant saw the light gradual disappear and fear to be surpris
in the cavern left it hi gun in hi hand a piec of biscuit and a
small quantiti of rum form hi supper and he snatch a few hour
sleep ly over the mouth of the cave
it wa a night of joi and terror such as thi man of stupend
emot had alreadi experienc twice or thrice in hi lifetim
chapter 25 the unknown
dai for which dant had so eagerli and impati wait with open
ey again dawn with the first light dant resum hi search
again he climb the rocki height he had ascend the previou even
and strain hi view to catch everi peculiar of the landscap but
it wore the same wild barren aspect when seen by the rai of the
morn sun which it had done when survei by the fade glimmer of
ev
descend into the grotto he lift the stone fill hi pocket
with gem put the box togeth as well and secur as he could
sprinkl fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken and
then carefulli trod down the earth to give it everywher a uniform
appear then quit the grotto he replac the stone heap
on it broken mass of rock and rough fragment of crumbl granit
fill the interstic with earth into which he deftli insert
rapidli grow plant such as the wild myrtl and flower thorn
then carefulli water these new plantat he scrupul effac
everi trace of footstep leav the approach to the cavern as
savagelook and untrodden as he had found it thi done he
impati await the return of hi companion to wait at mont

incalcul rich that had thu fallen into hi possess satisfi
not the crave of hi heart which yearn to return to dwell among
mankind and to assum the rank power and influenc which ar alwai
accord to wealththat first and greatest of all the forc within the
grasp of man
on the sixth dai the smuggler return from a distanc dant
recogn the rig and handl of la jeun amli and drag
himself with affect difficulti toward the landingplac he met hi
companion with an assur that although consider better than
when thei quit him he still suffer acut from hi late
accid he then inquir how thei had fare in their trip to thi
question the smuggler repli that although success in land
their cargo in safeti thei had scarc done so when thei receiv
intellig that a guardship had just quit the port of toulon and
wa crowd all sail toward them thi oblig them to make all the
speed thei could to evad the enemi when thei could but lament the
absenc of dant whose superior skill in the manag of a vessel
would have avail them so materi in fact the pursu vessel had
almost overtaken them when fortun night came on and enabl
them to doubl the cape of corsica and so elud all further pursuit
upon the whole howev the trip had been suffici success to
satisfi all concern while the crew and particularli jacopo
express great regret that dant had not been an equal sharer with
themselv in the profit which amount to no less a sum than fifti
piastr each

edmond preserv the most admir selfcommand not suffer the
faintest indic of a smile to escap him at the enumer of all
the benefit he would have reap had he been abl to quit the island
but as la jeun amli had mere come to mont cristo to fetch him
awai he embark that same even and proceed with the captain to
leghorn
arriv at leghorn he repair to the hous of a jew a dealer in
preciou stone to whom he dispos of four of hi smallest diamond
for five thousand franc each dant half fear that such valuabl

chapter 26 the pont du gard inn
such of my reader as have made a pedestrian excurs to the south of

the mistral blow on of the three curs of provenc the other

doubt of a curiou desir on the part of the agriculturist of the

with it strident monoton note
for about seven or eight year the littl tavern had been kept by a man

out into bitter invect against fate to all of which her husband
would calmli return an unvari repli in these philosoph word
hush la carcont it is god pleasur that thing should be so
the sobriquet of la carcont had been bestow on madelein radel
from the fact that she had been born in a villag so call situat
between salon and lambesc and as a custom exist among the

husband had bestow on her the name of la carcont in place of her
sweet and euphoni name of madelein which in all probabl hi
rude gutter languag would not have enabl him to pronounc
still let it not be suppos that amid thi affect resign to

there wa a brief silenc the abb rose and pace up and down
pensiv and then resum hi seat
you have two or three time mention a m morrel he said who wa

the owner of the pharaon and patron of dant
and what part did he plai in thi sad drama inquir the abb
the part of an honest man full of courag and real regard twenti
time he interced for edmond when the emperor return he wrote
implor threaten and so energet that on the second
restor he wa persecut as a bonapartist ten time as i told
you he came to see dant father and offer to receiv him in hi
own hous and the night or two befor hi death as i have alreadi

labor after have acquir a most honor name in the trade of
marseil m morrel is utterli ruin he ha lost five ship in two
year ha suffer by the bankruptci of three larg hous and hi
onli hope now is in that veri pharaon which poor dant command

indigo if thi ship founder like the other he is a ruin man
and ha the unfortun man wife or children inquir the abb
ye he ha a wife who through everyth ha behav like an angel

famili now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruin man he
ha besid a son a lieuten in the armi and as you mai suppos
all thi instead of lessen onli augment hi sorrow if he were
alon in the world he would blow out hi brain and there would be an
end
horribl ejacul the priest
and it is thu heaven recompens virtu sir ad caderouss you
see i who never did a bad action but that i have told you ofam in
destitut with my poor wife dy of fever befor my veri ey and
i unabl to do anyth in the world for her i shall die of hunger as
old dant did while fernand and danglar ar roll in wealth
how is that
becaus their deed have brought them good fortun while honest men
have been reduc to miseri
what ha becom of danglar the instig and therefor the most
guilti
what ha becom of him why he left marseil and wa taken on the
recommend of m morrel who did not know hi crime as cashier
into a spanish bank dure the war with spain he wa emploi in the
commissariat of the french armi and made a fortun then with that
monei he specul in the fund and trebl or quadrupl hi

and now he is the baron danglar with a fine resid in the rue du
montblanc with ten hors in hi stabl six footmen in hi
antechamb and i know not how mani million in hi strongbox
ah said the abb in a peculiar tone he is happi
happi who can answer for that happi or unhappi is the secret
known but to on self and the wallswal have ear but no tongu
but if a larg fortun produc happi danglar is happi
and fernand
fernand why much the same stori
but how could a poor catalan fisherboi without educ or
resourc make a fortun i confess thi stagger me
and it ha stagger everybodi there must have been in hi life some
strang secret that no on know
but then by what visibl step ha he attain thi high fortun or
high posit
both sirh ha both fortun and positionboth
thi must be imposs
it would seem so but listen and you will understand some dai
befor the return of the emperor fernand wa draft the bourbon
left him quietli enough at the catalan but napoleon return a
special levi wa made and fernand wa compel to join i went too
but as i wa older than fernand and had just marri my poor wife i

fernand would have been courtmarti if napoleon had remain on
the throne but hi action wa reward by the bourbon he return to
franc with the epaulet of sublieuten and as the protect of the

chapter 28 the prison regist
the dai after that in which the scene we have just describ had taken

the englishman seem to appreci thi extrem delicaci made hi bow
and went awai proceed with a characterist british stride toward
the street mention
m de bovil wa in hi privat room and the englishman on
perceiv him made a gestur of surpris which seem to indic
that it wa not the first time he had been in hi presenc as to m de
bovil he wa in such a state of despair that it wa evid all the
faculti of hi mind absorb in the thought which occupi him at
the moment did not allow either hi memori or hi imagin to strai

the englishman with the cool of hi nation address him in term
nearli similar to those with which he had accost the mayor of

oh sir exclaim m de bovil your fear ar unfortun but
too well found and you see befor you a man in despair i had two
hundr thousand franc place in the hand of morrel son these two
hundr thousand franc were the dowri of my daughter who wa to be

tell me that if hi ship the pharaon did not come into port on the
15th he would be wholli unabl to make thi payment
but said the englishman thi look veri much like a suspens of

20023m
and the englishman drew from hi pocket a bundl of banknot which
might have been twice the sum m de bovil fear to lose a rai of
joi pass across m de bovil counten yet he made an effort at
selfcontrol and said
sir i ought to tell you that in all probabl you will not
realiz six per cent of thi sum
that no affair of mine repli the englishman that is the affair
of the hous of thomson french in whose name i act thei have
perhap some motiv to serv in hasten the ruin of a rival firm
but all i know sir is that i am readi to hand you over thi sum in
exchang for your assign of the debt i onli ask a brokerag

name it sir i beg
you ar the inspector of prison
i have been so these fourteen year
you keep the regist of entri and departur
i do
to these regist there ar ad note rel to the prison
there ar special report on everi prison
well sir i wa educ at rome by a poor devil of an abb who
disappear suddenli i have sinc learn that he wa confin in the
chteau dif and i should like to learn some particular of hi
death
what wa hi name
the abb faria
oh i recollect him perfectli cri m de bovil he wa crazi
so thei said
oh he wa decidedli
veri possibl but what sort of mad wa it
he pretend to know of an immens treasur and offer vast sum to
the govern if thei would liber him
poor deviland he is dead
ye sir five or six month ago last februari
you have a good memori sir to recollect date so well
i recollect thi becaus the poor devil death wa accompani by a
singular incid
mai i ask what that wa said the englishman with an express of
curios which a close observ would have been astonish at
discov in hi phlegmat counten
oh dear ye sir the abb dungeon wa forti or fifti feet distant
from that of on of bonapart emissarieson of those who had
contribut the most to the return of the usurp in 1815 a veri
resolut and veri danger man
inde said the englishman
ye repli m de bovil i myself had occas to see thi man in
1816 or 1817 and we could onli go into hi dungeon with a file of
soldier that man made a deep impress on me i shall never forget
hi counten
20025m
the englishman smile impercept
and you sai sir he interpos that the two dungeon
were separ by a distanc of fifti feet but it appear that thi
edmond dant
thi danger man name wa
edmond dant it appear sir that thi edmond dant had procur
tool or made them for thei found a tunnel through which the
prison held commun with on anoth
thi tunnel wa dug no doubt with an intent of escap
no doubt but unfortun for the prison the abb faria had an
attack of catalepsi and di
that must have cut short the project of escap
for the dead man ye repli m de bovil but not for the
survivor on the contrari thi dant saw a mean of acceler hi
escap he no doubt thought that prison who di in the chteau
dif were inter in an ordinari burialground and he convei the
dead man into hi own cell took hi place in the sack in which thei
had sew up the corps and await the moment of inter
it wa a bold step and on that show some courag remark the
englishman
as i have alreadi told you sir he wa a veri danger man and
fortun by hi own act disembarrass the govern of the fear
it had on hi account
how wa that
how do you not comprehend
no
the chteau dif ha no cemeteri and thei simpli throw the dead into
the sea after fasten a thirtysixpound cannonbal to their feet
well observ the englishman as if he were slow of comprehens
well thei fasten a thirtysixpound ball to hi feet and threw him
into the sea
realli exclaim the englishman
ye sir continu the inspector of prison you mai imagin the
amaz of the fugit when he found himself flung headlong over the
rock i should like to have seen hi face at that moment
that would have been difficult
no matter repli de bovil in suprem goodhumor at the certainti
of recov hi two hundr thousand francsno matter i can fanci
it and he shout with laughter
so can i said the englishman and he laugh too but he laugh as
the english do at the end of hi teeth
and so continu the englishman who first gain hi composur he
wa drown
unquestion
so that the governor got rid of the danger and the crazi prison
at the same time
precis
20027m
but some offici document wa drawn up as to thi affair i suppos
inquir the englishman
ye ye the mortuari deposit you understand dant relat
if he had ani might have some interest in know if he were dead or
aliv
so that now if there were anyth to inherit from him thei mai do
so with easi conscienc he is dead and no mistak about it
oh ye and thei mai have the fact attest whenev thei pleas
so be it said the englishman but to return to these regist
true thi stori ha divert our attent from them excus me
excus you for what for the stori by no mean it realli seem to me
veri curiou
ye inde so sir you wish to see all relat to the poor abb
who realli wa gentl itself
ye you will much oblig me
go into my studi here and i will show it to you
and thei both enter m de bovil studi everyth wa here
arrang in perfect order each regist had it number each file of
paper it place the inspector beg the englishman to seat himself
in an armchair and place befor him the regist and document
rel to the chteau dif give him all the time he desir for
the examin while de bovil seat himself in a corner and began
to read hi newspap the englishman easili found the entri rel
to the abb faria but it seem that the histori which the inspector
had relat interest him greatli for after have perus the first
document he turn over the leav until he reach the deposit
respect edmond dant there he found everyth arrang in due
orderth accus examin morrel petit m de
villefort margin note he fold up the accus quietli and
put it as quietli in hi pocket read the examin and saw that the
name of noirtier wa not mention in it perus too the applic
date 10th april 1815 in which morrel by the deputi procureur
advic exagger with the best intent for napoleon wa then on
the throne the servic dant had render to the imperi
causeservic which villefort certif render indisput
then he saw through the whole thing thi petit to napoleon kept
back by villefort had becom under the second restor a terribl
weapon against him in the hand of the king attornei he wa no
longer astonish when he search on to find in the regist thi
note place in a bracket against hi name
edmond dant
an inveter bonapartist took an activ part in the return from the
island of elba
to be kept in strict solitari confin and to be close watch
and guard
beneath these line wa written in anoth hand see note
abovenoth can be done
he compar the write in the bracket with the write of the
certif place beneath morrel petit and discov that the
note in the bracket wa the same write as the certificatethat is to
sai wa in villefort handwrit
20029m
as to the note which accompani thi the englishman understood that
it might have been ad by some inspector who had taken a momentari
interest in dant situat but who had from the remark we have
quot found it imposs to give ani effect to the interest he had
felt
as we have said the inspector from discret and that he might not
disturb the abb faria pupil in hi research had seat himself in
a corner and wa read le drapeau blanc he did not see the
englishman fold up and place in hi pocket the accus written by
danglar under the arbor of la rserv and which had the postmark
marseil 27th februari deliveri 6 oclock pm
but it must be said that if he had seen it he attach so littl
import to thi scrap of paper and so much import to hi two
hundr thousand franc that he would not have oppos whatev the
englishman might do howev irregular it might be
thank said the latter close the regist with a slam i have
all i want now it is for me to perform my promis give me a simpl
assign of your debt acknowledg therein the receipt of the cash
and i will hand you over the monei
he rose gave hi seat to m de bovil who took it without ceremoni
and quickli drew up the requir assign while the englishman
count out the banknot on the other side of the desk
chapter 29 the hous of morrel son
anyon who had quit marseil a few year previous well
acquaint with the interior of morrel warehous and had return at

life of comfort and of happi that permeat a flourish and
prosper busi establishmentinstead of merri face at the
window busi clerk hurri to and fro in the long corridorsinstead
of the court fill with bale of good reecho with the cri and
the joke of porter on would have immedi perceiv all aspect
of sad and gloom out of all the numer clerk that us to fill
the desert corridor and the empti offic but two remain on wa a
young man of three or fourandtwenti who wa in love with m morrel

young men who us to throng thi vast now almost desert beehiv

in all probabl have repli to anyon who address him by it
cocl remain in m morrel servic and a most singular chang had
taken place in hi posit he had at the same time risen to the rank
of cashier and sunk to the rank of a servant he wa howev the
same cocl good patient devot but inflex on the subject of
arithmet the onli point on which he would have stood firm against
the world even against m morrel and strong in the
multiplicationt which he had at hi finger end no matter what
scheme or what trap wa laid to catch him
in the midst of the disast that befel the hous cocl wa the
onli on unmov but thi did not aris from a want of affect on
the contrari from a firm convict like the rat that on by on
forsak the doom ship even befor the vessel weigh anchor so all
the numer clerk had by degre desert the offic and the
warehous cocl had seen them go without think of inquir the
caus of their departur everyth wa as we have said a question of
arithmet to cocl and dure twenti year he had alwai seen all
payment made with such exactitud that it seem as imposs to him
that the hous should stop payment as it would to a miller that the
river that had so long turn hi mill should ceas to flow
noth had as yet occur to shake cocl belief the last month
payment had been made with the most scrupul exactitud cocl had
detect an overbal of fourteen sou in hi cash and the same
even he had brought them to m morrel who with a melancholi smile
threw them into an almost empti drawer sai
thank cocl you ar the pearl of cashier
cocl went awai perfectli happi for thi eulogium of m morrel
himself the pearl of the honest men of marseil flatter him more
than a present of fifti crown but sinc the end of the month m
morrel had pass mani an anxiou hour
in order to meet the payment then due he had collect all hi
resourc and fear lest the report of hi distress should get
bruit abroad at marseil when he wa known to be reduc to such an
extrem he went to the beaucair fair to sell hi wife and
daughter jewel and a portion of hi plate by thi mean the end of
the month wa pass but hi resourc were now exhaust credit
ow to the report afloat wa no longer to be had and to meet the
on hundr thousand franc due on the 15th of the present month and
the on hundr thousand franc due on the 15th of the next month to m
de bovil m morrel had in realiti no hope but the return of the
pharaon of whose departur he had learnt from a vessel which had
weigh anchor at the same time and which had alreadi arriv in
harbor
but thi vessel which like the pharaon came from calcutta had been
in for a fortnight while no intellig had been receiv of the

chapter 31 itali sinbad the sailor
toward the begin of the year 1838 two young men belong to the
first societi of pari the viscount albert de morcerf and the baron
franz dpinai were at florenc thei had agre to see the carniv
at rome that year and that franz who for the last three or four year
had inhabit itali should act as ciceron to albert
as it is no inconsider affair to spend the carniv at rome
especi when you have no great desir to sleep on the piazza del
popolo or the campo vaccino thei wrote to signor pastrini the
proprietor of the htel de londr piazza di spagna to reserv
comfort apart for them signor pastrini repli that he had
onli two room and a parlor on the third floor which he offer at the
low charg of a loui per diem thei accept hi offer but wish to
make the best us of the time that wa left albert start for napl
as for franz he remain at florenc and after have pass a few
dai in explor the paradis of the cascin and spend two or
three even at the hous of the florentin nobil he took a
fanci into hi head have alreadi visit corsica the cradl of
bonapart to visit elba the waitingplac of napoleon
on even he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring
that secur it to the dock at leghorn wrap himself in hi coat and
lai down and said to the crewto the island of elba
the boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morn franz
disembark at portoferrajo he travers the island after have
follow the trace which the footstep of the giant have left and
reembark for marciana
two hour after he again land at pianosa where he wa assur that
red partridg abound the sport wa bad franz onli succeed in
kill a few partridg and like everi unsuccess sportsman he
return to the boat veri much out of temper
ah if your excel chose said the captain you might have
capit sport
where
do you see that island continu the captain point to a conic
pile rise from the indigo sea
well what is thi island
the island of mont cristo
but i have no permiss to shoot over thi island
your excel doe not requir a permit for the island is
uninhabit
ah inde said the young man a desert island in the midst of the
mediterranean must be a curios
it is veri natur thi island is a mass of rock and doe not
contain an acr of land capabl of cultiv
to whom doe thi island belong
to tuscani
what game shall i find there
thousand of wild goat
who live upon the stone i suppos said franz with an incredul
smile
no but by brows the shrub and tree that grow out of the crevic
of the rock
where can i sleep
on shore in the grotto or on board in your cloak besid if your
excel pleas we can leav as soon as you likew can sail as
well by night as by dai and if the wind drop we can us our oar
as franz had suffici time and hi apart at rome were not yet
avail he accept the proposit upon hi answer in the
affirm the sailor exchang a few word togeth in a low tone
well ask he what now is there ani difficulti in the wai
no repli the captain but we must warn your excel that the
island is an infect port
what do you mean
mont cristo although uninhabit yet serv occasion as a refug
for the smuggler and pirat who come from corsica sardinia and
africa and if it becom known that we have been there we shall have
to perform quarantin for six dai on our return to leghorn
the deuc that put a differ face on the matter six dai why
that as long as the almighti took to make the world too long a
waittoo long
but who will sai your excel ha been to mont cristo
oh i shall not cri franz
nor i nor i chorus the sailor
then steer for mont cristo
the captain gave hi order the helm wa put up and the boat wa soon
sail in the direct of the island franz wait until all wa in
order and when the sail wa fill and the four sailor had taken
their placesthre forward and on at the helmh resum the
convers gaetano said he to the captain you tell me mont
cristo serv as a refug for pirat who ar it seem to me a veri
differ kind of game from the goat
ye your excel and it is true
i knew there were smuggler but i thought that sinc the captur of
algier and the destruct of the regenc pirat exist onli in
the romanc of cooper and captain marryat
your excel is mistaken there ar pirat like the bandit who
were believ to have been extermin by pope leo xii and who yet
everi dai rob travel at the gate of rome ha not your excel
heard that the french charg daffair wa rob six month ago
within five hundr pace of velletri
oh ye i heard that
well then if like us your excel live at leghorn you would
hear from time to time that a littl merchant vessel or an english
yacht that wa expect at bastia at portoferrajo or at civita
vecchia ha not arriv no on know what ha becom of it but
doubtless it ha struck on a rock and founder now thi rock it ha
met ha been a long and narrow boat man by six or eight men who
have surpris and plunder it some dark and stormi night near some
desert and gloomi island as bandit plunder a carriag in the recess
of a forest
but ask franz who lai wrap in hi cloak at the bottom of the
boat why do not those who have been plunder complain to the french
sardinian or tuscan govern
why said gaetano with a smile
ye why
becaus in the first place thei transfer from the vessel to their
own boat whatev thei think worth take then thei bind the crew hand
and foot thei attach to everyon neck a fourandtwentypound ball
a larg hole is chop in the vessel bottom and then thei leav
her at the end of ten minut the vessel begin to roll heavili and
settl down first on gunl goe under then the other then thei lift
and sink again and both go under at onc all at onc there a nois
like a cannonthat the air blow up the deck soon the water rush
out of the scupperhol like a whale spout the vessel give a last
groan spin round and round and disappear form a vast whirlpool
in the ocean and then all is over so that in five minut noth but
the ey of god can see the vessel where she li at the bottom of the
sea do you understand now said the captain why no complaint ar
made to the govern and why the vessel never reach port
it is probabl that if gaetano had relat thi previou to propos
the expedit franz would have hesit but now that thei had
start he thought it would be cowardli to draw back he wa on of
those men who do not rashli court danger but if danger present
itself combat it with the most unalter cool calm and
resolut he treat ani peril as he would an adversari in a
duelcalcul it probabl method of approach retreat if at all
as a point of strategi and not from cowardic wa quick to see an
open for attack and won victori at a singl thrust
bah said he i have travel through sicili and calabriai have
sail two month in the archipelago and yet i never saw even the
shadow of a bandit or a pirat
i did not tell your excel thi to deter you from your project
repli gaetano but you question me and i have answer that
all
ye and your convers is most interest and as i wish to enjoi
it as long as possibl steer for mont cristo
the wind blew strongli the boat made six or seven knot an hour and
thei were rapidli reach the end of their voyag as thei drew near
the island seem to lift from the sea and the air wa so clear that
thei could alreadi distinguish the rock heap on on anoth like
cannon ball in an arsen with green bush and tree grow in the
crevic as for the sailor although thei appear perfectli tranquil
yet it wa evid that thei were on the alert and that thei carefulli
watch the glassi surfac over which thei were sail and on which a
few fishingboat with their white sail were alon visibl
thei were within fifteen mile of mont cristo when the sun began to
set behind corsica whose mountain appear against the sky show
their rug peak in bold relief thi mass of rock like the giant
adamastor rose dead ahead a formid barrier and intercept the
light that gild it massiv peak so that the voyag were in
shadow littl by littl the shadow rose higher and seem to drive
befor it the last rai of the expir dai at last the reflect
rest on the summit of the mountain where it paus an instant like
the fieri crest of a volcano then gloom gradual cover the summit
as it had cover the base and the island now onli appear to be a
grai mountain that grew continu darker half an hour after the
night wa quit dark
fortun the marin were us to these latitud and knew everi
rock in the tuscan archipelago for in the midst of thi obscur
franz wa not without uneasinesscorsica had long sinc disappear
and mont cristo itself wa invis but the sailor seem like the
lynx to see in the dark and the pilot who steer did not evinc the
slightest hesit
an hour had pass sinc the sun had set when franz fanci he saw at
a quarter of a mile to the left a dark mass but he could not
precis make out what it wa and fear to excit the mirth of the
sailor by mistak a float cloud for land he remain silent
suddenli a great light appear on the strand land might resembl a
cloud but the fire wa not a meteor
what is thi light ask he
hush said the captain it is a fire
but you told me the island wa uninhabit
i said there were no fix habit on it but i said also that it
serv sometim as a harbor for smuggler
and for pirat
and for pirat return gaetano repeat franz word it is
for that reason i have given order to pass the island for as you
see the fire is behind us
but thi fire continu franz it seem to me rather reassur
than otherwis men who did not wish to be seen would not light a
fire
oh that goe for noth said gaetano if you can guess the
posit of the island in the dark you will see that the fire
cannot be seen from the side or from pianosa but onli from the sea
you think then thi fire indic the presenc of unpleas
neighbor
that is what we must find out return gaetano fix hi ey on
thi terrestri star
how can you find out
you shall see
gaetano consult with hi companion and after five minut
discuss a manuvr wa execut which caus the vessel to tack
about thei return the wai thei had come and in a few minut the
fire disappear hidden by an elev of the land the pilot again
chang the cours of the boat which rapidli approach the island
and wa soon within fifti pace of it gaetano lower the sail and
the boat came to rest all thi wa done in silenc and from the
moment that their cours wa chang not a word wa spoken
gaetano who had propos the expedit had taken all the
respons on himself the four sailor fix their ey on him
while thei got out their oar and held themselv in readi to row
awai which thank to the dark would not be difficult as for
franz he examin hi arm with the utmost cool he had two
doublebarrel gun and a rifl he load them look at the
prime and wait quietli
dure thi time the captain had thrown off hi vest and shirt and
secur hi trouser round hi waist hi feet were nake so he had no
shoe and stock to take off after these prepar he place hi
finger on hi lip and lower himself noiselessli into the sea swam
toward the shore with such precaut that it wa imposs to hear
the slightest sound he could onli be trace by the phosphoresc line
in hi wake thi track soon disappear it wa evid that he had
touch the shore
everyon on board remain motionless for half an hour when the same
lumin track wa again observ and the swimmer wa soon on board
well exclaim franz and the sailor in unison
thei ar spanish smuggler said he thei have with them two
corsican bandit
and what ar these corsican bandit do here with spanish
smuggler
ala return the captain with an accent of the most profound piti
we ought alwai to help on anoth veri often the bandit ar hard
press by gendarm or carbin well thei see a vessel and good
fellow like us on board thei come and demand hospit of us you
cant refus help to a poor hunt devil we receiv them and for
greater secur we stand out to sea thi cost us noth and save
the life or at least the liberti of a fellowcreatur who on the
first occas return the servic by point out some safe spot where
we can land our good without interrupt
ah said franz then you ar a smuggler occasion gaetano
your excel we must live somehow return the other smile
impenetr
then you know the men who ar now on mont cristo
oh ye we sailor ar like freemason and recogn each other by
sign
and do you think we have noth to fear if we land
noth at all smuggler ar not thiev
but these two corsican bandit said franz calcul the chanc
of peril
it is not their fault that thei ar bandit but that of the
author
how so
becaus thei ar pursu for have made a stiff as if it wa not in
a corsican natur to reveng himself
what do you mean by have made a stiffhav assassin a man
said franz continu hi investig
i mean that thei have kill an enemi which is a veri differ
thing return the captain
well said the young man let us demand hospit of these
smuggler and bandit do you think thei will grant it
without doubt
how mani ar thei
four and the two bandit make six
just our number so that if thei prove troublesom we shall be abl
to hold them in check so for the last time steer to mont cristo
ye but your excel will permit us to take all due precaut
by all mean be as wise as nestor and as prudent as ulyss i do
more than permit i exhort you
silenc then said gaetano
everyon obei for a man who like franz view hi posit in it
true light it wa a grave on he wa alon in the dark with
sailor whom he did not know and who had no reason to be devot to
him who knew that he had sever thousand franc in hi belt and who
had often examin hi weaponswhich were veri beautifulif not with
envi at least with curios on the other hand he wa about to land
without ani other escort than these men on an island which had
inde a veri religi name but which did not seem to franz like
to afford him much hospit thank to the smuggler and bandit
the histori of the scuttl vessel which had appear improb
dure the dai seem veri probabl at night place as he wa between
two possibl sourc of danger he kept hi ey on the crew and hi
gun in hi hand
the sailor had again hoist sail and the vessel wa onc more
cleav the wave through the dark franz whose ey were now
more accustom to it could see the loom shore along which the boat
wa sail and then as thei round a rocki point he saw the fire
more brilliant than ever and about it five or six person seat the
blaze illumin the sea for a hundr pace around gaetano skirt the
light carefulli keep the boat in the shadow then when thei were
opposit the fire he steer to the centr of the circl sing a
fish song of which hi companion sung the choru
at the first word of the song the men seat round the fire aros and
approach the landingplac their ey fix on the boat evid
seek to know who the newcom were and what were their intent
thei soon appear satisfi and return with the except of on
who remain at the shore to their fire at which the carcass of a
goat wa roast when the boat wa within twenti pace of the shore
the man on the beach who carri a carbin present arm after the
manner of a sentinel and cri who come there in sardinian
franz coolli cock both barrel gaetano then exchang a few word
with thi man which the travel did not understand but which
evid concern him
will your excel give your name or remain incognito ask the
captain
my name must rest unknown repli franz mere sai i am a
frenchman travel for pleasur
as soon as gaetano had transmit thi answer the sentinel gave an
order to on of the men seat round the fire who rose and disappear
among the rock not a word wa spoken everyon seem occupi franz
with hi disembark the sailor with their sail the smuggler
with their goat but in the midst of all thi careless it wa
evid that thei mutual observ each other
the man who had disappear return suddenli on the opposit side to
that by which he had left he made a sign with hi head to the
sentinel who turn to the boat said saccommodi the italian
saccommodi is untranslat it mean at onc come enter you
ar welcom make yourself at home you ar the master it is like
that turkish phrase of molir that so astonish the bourgeoi
gentleman by the number of thing impli in it utter
the sailor did not wait for a second invit four stroke of the
oar brought them to land gaetano sprang to shore exchang a few
word with the sentinel then hi comrad disembark and lastli came
franz on of hi gun wa swung over hi shoulder gaetano had the
other and a sailor held hi rifl hi dress half artist half dandi
did not excit ani suspicion and consequ no disquietud the
boat wa moor to the shore and thei advanc a few pace to find a
comfort bivouac but doubtless the spot thei chose did not suit
the smuggler who fill the post of sentinel for he cri out
not that wai if you pleas
gaetano falter an excus and advanc to the opposit side while
two sailor kindl torch at the fire to light them on their wai
thei advanc about thirti pace and then stop at a small esplanad
surround with rock in which seat had been cut not unlik
sentrybox around in the crevic of the rock grew a few dwarf oak
and thick bush of myrtl franz lower a torch and saw by the mass
of cinder that had accumul that he wa not the first to discov
thi retreat which wa doubtless on of the haltingplac of the
wander visitor of mont cristo
as for hi suspicion onc on terra firma onc that he had seen the
indiffer if not friendli appear of hi host hi anxieti had
quit disappear or rather at sight of the goat had turn to
appetit he mention thi to gaetano who repli that noth could
be more easi than to prepar a supper when thei had in their boat
bread wine half a dozen partridg and a good fire to roast them by
besid ad he if the smell of their roast meat tempt you i
will go and offer them two of our bird for a slice
you ar a born diplomat return franz go and try
meanwhil the sailor had collect dri stick and branch with
which thei made a fire franz wait impati inhal the aroma of
the roast meat when the captain return with a mysteri air
well said franz anyth newdo thei refus
on the contrari return gaetano the chief who wa told you were
a young frenchman invit you to sup with him
well observ franz thi chief is veri polit and i see no
objectionth more so as i bring my share of the supper
oh it is not that he ha plenti and to spare for supper but he
make on condit and rather a peculiar on befor he will receiv
you at hi hous
hi hous ha he built on here then
no but he ha a veri comfort on all the same so thei sai
you know thi chief then
i have heard talk of him
favor or otherwis
both
the deuceand what is thi condit
that you ar blindfold and do not take off the bandag until he
himself bid you
franz look at gaetano to see if possibl what he thought of thi
propos ah repli he guess franz thought i know thi is a
seriou matter
what should you do in my place
i who have noth to losei should go
20075m
you would accept
ye were it onli out of curios
there is someth veri peculiar about thi chief then
listen said gaetano lower hi voic i do not know if what thei
sai is trueh stop to see if anyon wa near
what do thei sai
that thi chief inhabit a cavern to which the pitti palac is
noth
what nonsens said franz reseat himself
it is no nonsens it is quit true cama the pilot of the saint
ferdinand went in onc and he came back amaz vow that such
treasur were onli to be heard of in fairi tale
do you know observ franz that with such stori you make me
think of ali baba enchant cavern
i tell you what i have been told
then you advis me to accept
oh i dont sai that your excel will do as you pleas i should
be sorri to advis you in the matter
franz ponder the matter for a few moment conclud that a man so
rich could not have ani intent of plunder him of what littl he
had and see onli the prospect of a good supper accept gaetano
depart with the repli franz wa prudent and wish to learn all he
possibl could concern hi host he turn toward the sailor who
dure thi dialogu had sat grave pluck the partridg with the
air of a man proud of hi offic and ask him how these men had
land as no vessel of ani kind wa visibl
never mind that return the sailor i know their vessel
is it a veri beauti vessel
i would not wish for a better to sail round the world
of what burden is she
about a hundr ton but she is built to stand ani weather she is
what the english call a yacht
where wa she built
i know not but my own opinion is she is a genoes
and how did a leader of smuggler continu franz ventur to build
a vessel design for such a purpos at genoa
i did not sai that the owner wa a smuggler repli the sailor
no but gaetano did i thought
gaetano had onli seen the vessel from a distanc he had not then
spoken to anyon
and if thi person be not a smuggler who is he
a wealthi signor who travel for hi pleasur
come thought franz he is still more mysteri sinc the two
account do not agre
what is hi name
if you ask him he sai sinbad the sailor but i doubt if it be hi
real name
sinbad the sailor
ye
and where doe he resid
on the sea
what countri doe he come from
i do not know
have you ever seen him
sometim
what sort of a man is he
your excel will judg for yourself
where will he receiv me
no doubt in the subterranean palac gaetano told you of
have you never had the curios when you have land and found thi
island desert to seek for thi enchant palac
oh ye more than onc but alwai in vain we examin the grotto
all over but we never could find the slightest trace of ani open
thei sai that the door is not open by a kei but a magic word
decidedli mutter franz thi is an arabian night adventur
hi excel wait for you said a voic which he recogn as
that of the sentinel he wa accompani by two of the yacht crew
franz drew hi handkerchief from hi pocket and present it to the
man who had spoken to him without utter a word thei bandag hi
ey with a care that show their apprehens of hi commit some
indiscret afterward he wa made to promis that he would not make
the least attempt to rais the bandag he promis
then hi two guid took hi arm and he went on guid by them and
preced by the sentinel after go about thirti pace he smelt the
appet odor of the kid that wa roast and knew thu that he wa
pass the bivouac thei then led him on about fifti pace farther
evid advanc toward that part of the shore where thei would not
allow gaetano to goa refus he could now comprehend
present by a chang in the atmospher he knew that thei were
enter a cave after go on for a few second more he heard a
crackl and it seem to him as though the atmospher again chang
and becam balmi and perfum at length hi feet touch on a thick
and soft carpet and hi guid let go their hold of him there wa a
moment silenc and then a voic in excel french although with
a foreign accent said
welcom sir i beg you will remov your bandag
it mai be suppos then franz did not wait for a repetit of thi
permiss but took off the handkerchief and found himself in the
presenc of a man from thirtyeight to forti year of ag dress in a
tunisian costum that is to sai a red cap with a long blue silk
tassel a vest of black cloth embroid with gold pantaloon of deep
red larg and full gaiter of the same color embroid with gold
like the vest and yellow slipper he had a splendid cashmer round
hi waist and a small sharp and crook cangiar wa pass through hi
girdl
although of a pale that wa almost livid thi man had a remark
handsom face hi ey were penetr and sparkl hi nose quit
straight and project direct from the brow wa of the pure greek
type while hi teeth as white as pearl were set off to admir
by the black moustach that encircl them
hi pallor wa so peculiar that it seem to pertain to on who had
been long entomb and who wa incap of resum the healthi glow
and hue of life he wa not particularli tall but extrem well made
and like the men of the south had small hand and feet but what
astonish franz who had treat gaetano descript as a fabl wa
the splendor of the apart in which he found himself
the entir chamber wa line with crimson brocad work with flower
of gold in a recess wa a kind of divan surmount with a stand of
arabian sword in silver scabbard and the handl resplend with
gem from the ceil hung a lamp of venetian glass of beauti
shape and color while the feet rest on a turkei carpet in which
thei sunk to the instep tapestri hung befor the door by which franz
had enter and also in front of anoth door lead into a second
apart which seem to be brilliantli illumin
the host gave franz time to recov from hi surpris and moreov
return look for look not even take hi ey off him
sir he said after a paus a thousand excus for the precaut
taken in your introduct hither but as dure the greater portion
of the year thi island is desert if the secret of thi abod were
discov i should doubtless find on my return my temporari
retir in a state of great disord which would be exceedingli
annoi not for the loss it occas me but becaus i should not
have the certainti i now possess of separ myself from all the rest
of mankind at pleasur let me now endeavor to make you forget thi
temporari unpleas and offer you what no doubt you did not
expect to find herethat is to sai a toler supper and pretti
comfort bed
ma foi my dear sir repli franz make no apolog i have
alwai observ that thei bandag peopl ey who penetr enchant

by wai of chang the convers you pass your life in
travel

reveng for instanc observ franz
the unknown fix on the young man on of those look which penetr
into the depth of the heart and thought and why reveng he ask
becaus repli franz you seem to me like a man who persecut by
societi ha a fear account to settl with it

the supper appear to have been suppli sole for franz for the
unknown scarc touch on or two dish of the splendid banquet to
which hi guest did ampl justic then ali brought on the dessert or
rather took the basket from the hand of the statu and place them
on the tabl between the two basket he place a small silver cup with
a silver cover the care with which ali place thi cup on the tabl
rous franz curios he rais the cover and saw a kind of
greenish past someth like preserv angelica but which wa
perfectli unknown to him he replac the lid as ignor of what the
cup contain as he wa befor he had look at it and then cast
hi ey toward hi host he saw him smile at hi disappoint
you cannot guess said he what there is in that small vase can

well then that green preserv is noth less than the ambrosia
which hebe serv at the tabl of jupit
but repli franz thi ambrosia no doubt in pass through
mortal hand ha lost it heavenli appel and assum a human
name in vulgar phrase what mai you term thi composit for which
to tell the truth i do not feel ani particular desir
ah thu it is that our materi origin is reveal cri sinbad

tempt what i offer you and is it not an easi thing sinc it is
onli to do thu look
at these word he uncov the small cup which contain the substanc
so laud took a teaspoon of the magic sweetmeat rais it to hi
lip and swallow it slowli with hi ey half shut and hi head bent
backward franz did not disturb him whilst he absorb hi favorit
sweetmeat but when he had finish he inquir
what then is thi preciou stuff
did you ever hear he repli of the old man of the mountain who
attempt to assassin philipp august
of cours i have
well you know he reign over a rich vallei which wa overhung by the
mountain whenc he deriv hi picturesqu name in thi vallei were
magnific garden plant by hassenbensabah and in these garden
isol pavilion into these pavilion he admit the elect and
there sai marco polo gave them to eat a certain herb which
transport them to paradis in the midst of everbloom shrub
everrip fruit and everlov virgin what these happi person took
for realiti wa but a dream but it wa a dream so soft so voluptu
so enthral that thei sold themselv bodi and soul to him who gave
it to them and obedi to hi order as to those of a deiti struck
down the design victim di in tortur without a murmur believ
that the death thei underw wa but a quick transit to that life
of delight of which the holi herb now befor you had given them a
slight foretast
then cri franz it is hashish i know thatbi name at least

most unadulter hashish of alexandriath hashish of abougor the
celebr maker the onli man the man to whom there should be built a
palac inscrib with these word a grate world to the dealer in

do you know said franz i have a veri great inclin to judg
for myself of the truth or exagger of your eulogi
judg for yourself signor aladdinjudg but do not confin yourself
to on trial like everyth els we must habitu the sens to a
fresh impress gentl or violent sad or joyou there is a struggl
in natur against thi divin substancein natur which is not made
for joi and cling to pain natur subdu must yield in the combat
the dream must succe to realiti and then the dream reign suprem
then the dream becom life and life becom the dream but what
chang occur it is onli by compar the pain of actual be with
the joi of the assum exist that you would desir to live no
longer but to dream thu forev when you return to thi mundan
sphere from your visionari world you would seem to leav a neapolitan
spring for a lapland winterto quit paradis for earthheaven for hell
tast the hashish guest of minetast the hashish
franz onli repli wa to take a teaspoon of the marvel
prepar about as much in quantiti as hi host had eaten and lift
it to hi mouth
diabl he said after have swallow the divin preserv i do
not know if the result will be as agreeabl as you describ but the
thing doe not appear to me as palat as you sai
becaus your palat hi not yet been attun to the sublim of the
substanc it flavor tell me the first time you tast oyster tea
porter truffl and sundri other dainti which you now ador did
you like them could you comprehend how the roman stuf their
pheasant with assaftida and the chines eat swallow nest eh no
well it is the same with hashish onli eat for a week and noth in
the world will seem to you to equal the delicaci of it flavor which
now appear to you flat and distast let us now go into the
adjoin chamber which is your apart and ali will bring us
coffe and pipe
thei both aros and while he who call himself sinbadand whom we
have occasion name so that we might like hi guest have some
titl by which to distinguish himgav some order to the servant
franz enter still anoth apart
it wa simpli yet richli furnish it wa round and a larg divan
complet encircl it divan wall ceil floor were all cover
with magnific skin as soft and downi as the richest carpet there
were heavyman lionskin from atla stripe tigerskin from
bengal pantherskin from the cape spot beautifulli like those
that appear to dant bearskin from siberia foxskin from norwai
and so on and all these skin were strewn in profus on on the
other so that it seem like walk over the most mossi turf or
reclin on the most luxuri bed
both laid themselv down on the divan chibouqu with jasmin tube
and amber mouthpiec were within reach and all prepar so that there
wa no need to smoke the same pipe twice each of them took on which
ali light and then retir to prepar the coffe
there wa a moment silenc dure which sinbad gave himself up to
thought that seem to occupi him incessantli even in the midst of
hi convers and franz abandon himself to that mute reveri
into which we alwai sink when smoke excel tobacco which seem
to remov with it fume all the troubl of the mind and to give the
smoker in exchang all the vision of the soul ali brought in the
coffe
how do you take it inquir the unknown in the french or turkish
style strong or weak sugar or none cool or boil as you pleas
it is readi in all wai
i will take it in the turkish style repli franz
and you ar right said hi host it show you have a tendenc for
an orient life ah those orient thei ar the onli men who know
how to live as for me he ad with on of those singular smile
which did not escap the young man when i have complet my affair
in pari i shall go and die in the east and should you wish to see me
again you must seek me at cairo bagdad or ispahan
20087m
ma foi said franz it would be the easiest thing in the world
for i feel eagl wing spring out at my shoulder and with those
wing i could make a tour of the world in fourandtwenti hour
ah ye the hashish is begin it work well unfurl your wing
and fly into superhuman region fear noth there is a watch over
you and if your wing like those of icaru melt befor the sun we
ar here to eas your fall
he then said someth in arab to ali who made a sign of obedi
and withdrew but not to ani distanc
as to franz a strang transform had taken place in him all the
bodili fatigu of the dai all the preoccup of mind which the
event of the even had brought on disappear as thei do at the
first approach of sleep when we ar still suffici consciou to be
awar of the come of slumber hi bodi seem to acquir an airi
light hi percept brighten in a remark manner hi sens
seem to redoubl their power the horizon continu to expand but it
wa not the gloomi horizon of vagu alarm and which he had seen
befor he slept but a blue transpar unbound horizon with all
the blue of the ocean all the spangl of the sun all the perfum of
the summer breez then in the midst of the song of hi
sailorssong so clear and sonor that thei would have made a
divin harmoni had their note been taken downh saw the island of
mont cristo no longer as a threaten rock in the midst of the
wave but as an oasi in the desert then as hi boat drew nearer
the song becam louder for an enchant and mysteri harmoni rose
to heaven as if some lorelei had decre to attract a soul thither or
amphion the enchant intend there to build a citi
at length the boat touch the shore but without effort without
shock as lip touch lip and he enter the grotto amidst continu
strain of most delici melodi he descend or rather seem to
descend sever step inhal the fresh and balmi air like that
which mai be suppos to reign around the grotto of circ form from
such perfum as set the mind adream and such fire as burn the
veri sens and he saw again all he had seen befor hi sleep from
sinbad hi singular host to ali the mute attend then all seem
to fade awai and becom confus befor hi ey like the last shadow
of the magic lantern befor it is extinguish and he wa again in the
chamber of statu light onli by on of those pale and antiqu lamp
which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasur
thei were the same statu rich in form in attract and poesi
with ey of fascin smile of love and bright and flow hair
thei were phryne cleopatra messalina those three celebr
courtesan then among them glide like a pure rai like a christian
angel in the midst of olympu on of those chast figur those calm
shadow those soft vision which seem to veil it virgin brow
befor these marbl wanton
then the three statu advanc toward him with look of love and
approach the couch on which he wa repos their feet hidden in
their long white tunic their throat bare hair flow like wave
and assum attitud which the god could not resist but which
saint withstood and look inflex and ardent like those with which
the serpent charm the bird and then he gave wai befor look that
held him in a tortur grasp and delight hi sens as with a
voluptu kiss
it seem to franz that he close hi ey and in a last look about
him saw the vision of modesti complet veil and then follow a
dream of passion like that promis by the prophet to the elect lip
of stone turn to flame breast of ic becam like heat lava so
that to franz yield for the first time to the swai of the drug
love wa a sorrow and voluptu a tortur as burn mouth were
press to hi thirsti lip and he wa held in cool serpentlik
embrac the more he strove against thi unhallow passion the more
hi sens yield to it thrall and at length weari of a struggl
that tax hi veri soul he gave wai and sank back breathless and
exhaust beneath the kiss of these marbl goddess and the
enchant of hi marvel dream
chapter 32 the wake
when franz return to himself he seem still to be in a dream he
thought himself in a sepulchr into which a rai of sunlight in piti
scarc penetr he stretch forth hi hand and touch stone he
rose to hi seat and found himself ly on hi bournou in a bed of
dry heather veri soft and odorifer the vision had fled and as if
the statu had been but shadow from the tomb thei had vanish at
hi wake
he advanc sever pace toward the point whenc the light came and
to all the excit of hi dream succeed the calm of realiti
he found that he wa in a grotto went toward the open and through
a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azur sky the air and water
were shine in the beam of the morn sun on the shore the sailor
were sit chat and laugh and at ten yard from them the
boat wa at anchor undul gracefulli on the water
there for some time he enjoi the fresh breez which plai on hi
brow and listen to the dash of the wave on the beach that left
against the rock a lace of foam as white as silver he wa for some
time without reflect or thought for the divin charm which is in the
thing of natur special after a fantast dream then gradual
thi view of the outer world so calm so pure so grand remind him
of the illus of hi vision and onc more awaken memori he
recal hi arriv on the island hi present to a smuggler
chief a subterranean palac full of splendor an excel supper and
a spoon of hashish
it seem howev even in the veri face of open dai that at least a
year had elaps sinc all these thing had pass so deep wa the
impress made in hi mind by the dream and so strong a hold had it
taken of hi imagin thu everi now and then he saw in fanci amid
the sailor seat on a rock or undul in the vessel on of the
shadow which had share hi dream with look and kiss otherwis
hi head wa perfectli clear and hi bodi refresh he wa free from
the slightest headach on the contrari he felt a certain degre of
light a faculti for absorb the pure air and enjoi the
bright sunshin more vividli than ever
he went gayli up to the sailor who rose as soon as thei perceiv
him and the patron accost him said
the signor sinbad ha left hi compliment for your excel and
desir us to express the regret he feel at not be abl to take hi
leav in person but he trust you will excus him as veri import
busi call him to malaga
so then gaetano said franz thi is then all realiti there
exist a man who ha receiv me in thi island entertain me right
royal and ha depart while i wa asleep
he exist as certainli as that you mai see hi small yacht with all
her sail spread and if you will us your glass you will in all
probabl recogn your host in the midst of hi crew
so sai gaetano point in a direct in which a small vessel wa
make sail toward the southern point of corsica franz adjust hi
telescop and direct it toward the yacht gaetano wa not mistaken
at the stern the mysteri stranger wa stand up look toward
the shore and hold a spyglass in hi hand he wa attir as he
had been on the previou even and wave hi pockethandkerchief to
hi guest in token of adieu franz return the salut by shake hi
handkerchief as an exchang of signal after a second a slight cloud
of smoke wa seen at the stern of the vessel which rose gracefulli as
it expand in the air and then franz heard a slight report
there do you hear observ gaetano he is bid you adieu
the young man took hi carbin and fire it in the air but without ani
idea that the nois could be heard at the distanc which separ the
yacht from the shore
what ar your excel order inquir gaetano
in the first place light me a torch
ah ye i understand repli the patron to find the entranc to
the enchant apart with much pleasur your excel if it
would amus you and i will get you the torch you ask for but i too
have had the idea you have and two or three time the same fanci ha
come over me but i have alwai given it up giovanni light a torch
he ad and give it to hi excel
giovanni obei franz took the lamp and enter the subterranean
grotto follow by gaetano he recogn the place where he had
awak by the bed of heather that wa there but it wa in vain that he
carri hi torch all round the exterior surfac of the grotto he saw
noth unless that by trace of smoke other had befor him
attempt the same thing and like him in vain yet he did not leav
a foot of thi granit wall as impenetr as futur without
strict scrutini he did not see a fissur without introduc the blade
of hi hunt sword into it or a project point on which he did not
lean and press in the hope it would give wai all wa vain and he
lost two hour in hi attempt which were at last utterli useless at
the end of thi time he gave up hi search and gaetano smile
when franz appear again on the shore the yacht onli seem like a
small white speck on the horizon he look again through hi glass
but even then he could not distinguish anyth
gaetano remind him that he had come for the purpos of shoot
goat which he had utterli forgotten he took hi fowlingpiec and
began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfil a
duti rather than enjoi a pleasur and at the end of a quarter of
an hour he had kill a goat and two kid these anim though wild
and agil as chamoi were too much like domest goat and franz
could not consid them as game moreov other idea much more
enthral occupi hi mind sinc the even befor he had
realli been the hero of on of the tale of the thousand and on
night and he wa irresist attract toward the grotto
then in spite of the failur of hi first search he began a second
after have told gaetano to roast on of the two kid the second
visit wa a long on and when he return the kid wa roast and the
repast readi franz wa sit on the spot where he wa on the
previou even when hi mysteri host had invit him to supper
and he saw the littl yacht now like a seagul on the wave
continu her flight toward corsica
why he remark to gaetano you told me that signor sinbad wa
go to malaga while it seem he is in the direct of
portovecchio
dont you rememb said the patron i told you that among the crew
there were two corsican brigand
true and he is go to land them ad franz
precis so repli gaetano ah he is on who fear neither god
nor satan thei sai and would at ani time run fifti leagu out of hi
cours to do a poor devil a servic
20093m
but such servic as these might involv him with the author of
the countri in which he practic thi kind of philanthropi said
franz
and what care he for that repli gaetano with a laugh or ani
author he smile at them let them try to pursu him why in the
first place hi yacht is not a ship but a bird and he would beat ani
frigat three knot in everi nine and if he were to throw himself on
the coast why is he not certain of find friend everywher
it wa perfectli clear that the signor sinbad franz host had the
honor of be on excel term with the smuggler and bandit along
the whole coast of the mediterranean and so enjoi except
privileg as to franz he had no longer ani induc to remain at
mont cristo he had lost all hope of detect the secret of the
grotto he consequ despatch hi breakfast and hi boat be
readi he hasten on board and thei were soon under wai at the
moment the boat began her cours thei lost sight of the yacht as it
disappear in the gulf of portovecchio with it wa effac the last
trace of the preced night and then supper sinbad hashish
statuesal becam a dream for franz
the boat sail on all dai and all night and next morn when the
sun rose thei had lost sight of mont cristo
when franz had onc again set foot on shore he forgot for the moment
at least the event which had just pass while he finish hi
affair of pleasur at florenc and then thought of noth but how he
should rejoin hi companion who wa await him at rome
he set out and on the saturdai even reach the place de la douan

between life and death which render it similar to a kind of station
between thi world and the nexta sublim spot a restingplac full of
poetri and charact and at which franz had alreadi halt five or six
time and at each time found it more marvel and strike

young men of the richest and noblest famili of rome accompani them

countri in the world thei were attir as peasant of albano
velletri civitacastellana and sora we need hardli add that these
peasant costum like those of the young women were brilliant with
gold and jewel
carmela wish to form a quadril but there wa on ladi want
carmela look all around her but not on of the guest had a costum
similar to her own or those of her companion the count of sanfelic
point out teresa who wa hang on luigi arm in a group of
peasant
will you allow me father said carmela
certainli repli the count ar we not in carniv time
carmela turn toward the young man who wa talk with her and
sai a few word to him point with her finger to teresa the young
man look bow in obedi and then went to teresa and invit
her to danc in a quadril direct by the count daughter teresa
felt a flush pass over her face she look at luigi who could not
refus hi assent luigi slowli relinquish teresa arm which he had
held beneath hi own and teresa accompani by her eleg cavali
took her appoint place with much agit in the aristocrat
quadril certainli in the ey of an artist the exact and strict
costum of teresa had a veri differ charact from that of carmela
and her companion and teresa wa frivol and coquettish and thu
the embroideri and muslin the cashmer waistgirdl all dazzl
her and the reflect of sapphir and diamond almost turn her
giddi brain
luigi felt a sensat hitherto unknown aris in hi mind it wa
like an acut pain which gnaw at hi heart and then thrill through
hi whole bodi he follow with hi ey each movement of teresa and
her cavali when their hand touch he felt as though he should
swoon everi puls beat with violenc and it seem as though a bell
were ring in hi ear when thei spoke although teresa listen
timidli and with downcast ey to the convers of her cavali as
luigi could read in the ardent look of the goodlook young man that
hi languag wa that of prais it seem as if the whole world wa
turn round with him and all the voic of hell were whisper in
hi ear idea of murder and assassin then fear that hi
paroxysm might get the better of him he clutch with on hand the
branch of a tree against which he wa lean and with the other
convuls grasp the dagger with a carv handl which wa in hi
belt and which unwittingli he drew from the scabbard from time to
time
luigi wa jealou
he felt that influenc by her ambit and coquettish disposit
teresa might escap him
the young peasant girl at first timid and scare soon recov
herself we have said that teresa wa handsom but thi is not all
teresa wa endow with all those wild grace which ar so much more
potent than our affect and studi eleg she had almost all the
honor of the quadril and if she were enviou of the count of
sanfelic daughter we will not undertak to sai that carmela wa
not jealou of her and with overpow compliment her handsom
cavali led her back to the place whenc he had taken her and where
luigi await her twice or thrice dure the danc the young girl had
glanc at luigi and each time she saw that he wa pale and that hi
featur were agit onc even the blade of hi knife half drawn
from it sheath had dazzl her ey with it sinist glare thu it
wa almost tremblingli that she resum her lover arm the quadril
had been most perfect and it wa evid there wa a great demand for
a repetit carmela alon object to it but the count of
sanfelic besought hi daughter so earnestli that she acced
on of the cavali then hasten to invit teresa without whom it
wa imposs for the quadril to be form but the young girl had
disappear
the truth wa that luigi had not felt the strength to support anoth
such trial and half by persuas and half by forc he had remov
teresa toward anoth part of the garden teresa had yield in spite
of herself but when she look at the agit counten of the
young man she understood by hi silenc and trembl voic that
someth strang wa pass within him she herself wa not exempt
from intern emot and without have done anyth wrong yet
fulli comprehend that luigi wa right in reproach her why she
did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproach
were merit
howev to teresa great astonish luigi remain mute and not
a word escap hi lip the rest of the even when the chill of the
night had driven awai the guest from the garden and the gate of the
villa were close on them for the festa indoor he took teresa
quit awai and as he left her at her home he said

and what said your cavali to you
he said it onli depend on myself to have it and i had onli on
word to sai
he wa right said luigi do you desir it as ardent as you sai

the young girl much astonish rais her head to look at him but
hi face wa so gloomi and terribl that her word froze to her lip
as luigi spoke thu he left her teresa follow him with her ey
into the dark as long as she could and when he had quit

someth extraordinari look at him steadfastli
teresa said luigi yesterdai even you told me you would give
all the world to have a costum similar to that of the count

rest of the costum
teresa utter a cry of joi and without inquir whenc thi attir
came or even thank luigi dart into the grotto transform into
a dressingroom
luigi push the stone behind her for on the crest of a small
adjac hill which cut off the view toward palestrina he saw a
travel on horseback stop a moment as if uncertain of hi road
and thu present against the blue sky that perfect outlin which is
peculiar to distant object in southern clime when he saw luigi he
put hi hors into a gallop and advanc toward him
luigi wa not mistaken the travel who wa go from palestrina

teresa wa cloth from head to foot in the garb of the count of

convei it to the grotto while in her turn teresa remain outsid
if a second travel had pass he would have seen a strang thinga

thei seek for him in the mountain and he is on the water thei

chapter 34 the colosseum
franz had so manag hi rout that dure the ride to the colosseum
thei pass not a singl ancient ruin so that no preliminari
impress interf to mitig the coloss proport of the
gigant build thei came to admir the road select wa a
continu of the via sistina then by cut off the right angl of
the street in which stand santa maria maggior and proceed by the
via urbana and san pietro in vincoli the travel would find
themselv directli opposit the colosseum
thi itinerari possess anoth great advantagethat of leav franz
at full liberti to indulg hi deep reveri upon the subject of signor
pastrini stori in which hi mysteri host of mont cristo wa so
strang mix up seat with fold arm in a corner of the
carriag he continu to ponder over the singular histori he had so
late listen to and to ask himself an intermin number of
question touch it variou circumst without howev arriv
at a satisfactori repli to ani of them
on fact more than the rest brought hi friend sinbad the sailor back
to hi recollect and that wa the mysteri sort of intimaci that
seem to exist between the brigand and the sailor and pastrini
account of vampa have found refug on board the vessel of
smuggler and fishermen remind franz of the two corsican bandit he
had found sup so amic with the crew of the littl yacht which
had even deviat from it cours and touch at portovecchio for the
sole purpos of land them the veri name assum by hi host of
mont cristo and again repeat by the landlord of the htel de
londr abundantli prove to him that hi island friend wa plai
hi philanthrop part on the shore of piombino civita vecchia
ostia and gata as on those of corsica tuscani and spain and
further franz bethought him of have heard hi singular entertain
speak both of tuni and palermo prove therebi how larg hi circl
of acquaint extend
but howev the mind of the young man might be absorb in these
reflect thei were at onc dispers at the sight of the dark
frown ruin of the stupend colosseum through the variou
open of which the pale moonlight plai and flicker like the
unearthli gleam from the ey of the wander dead the carriag
stop near the meta sudan the door wa open and the young men
eagerli alight found themselv opposit a ciceron who appear
to have sprung up from the ground so unexpect wa hi appear
the usual guid from the hotel have follow them thei had paid two
conductor nor is it possibl at rome to avoid thi abund suppli
of guid besid the ordinari ciceron who seiz upon you
directli you set foot in your hotel and never quit you while you
remain in the citi there is also a special ciceron belong to
each monumentnai almost to each part of a monument it mai
therefor be easili imagin there is no scarciti of guid at the
colosseum that wonder of all ag which martial thu eulog
let memphi ceas to boast the barbar miracl of her pyramid and
the wonder of babylon be talk of no more among us all must bow to
the superior of the gigant labor of the csar and the mani
voic of fame spread far and wide the surpass merit of thi
incompar monument
as for albert and franz thei essai not to escap from their
ciceronian tyrant and inde it would have been so much the more
difficult to break their bondag as the guid alon ar permit to
visit these monument with torch in their hand thu then the
young men made no attempt at resist but blindli and confidingli
surrend themselv into the care and custodi of their conductor
franz had alreadi made seven or eight similar excurs to the
colosseum while hi less favor companion trod for the first time in
hi life the classic ground form the monument of flaviu vespasian
and to hi credit be it spoken hi mind even amid the glib loquac
of the guid wa duli and deepli touch with aw and enthusiast
admir of all he saw and certainli no adequ notion of these
stupend ruin can be form save by such as have visit them and
more especi by moonlight at which time the vast proport of the
build appear twice as larg when view by the mysteri beam of a
southern moonlit sky whose rai ar suffici clear and vivid to
light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western
clime
scarc therefor had the reflect franz walk a hundr step
beneath the interior portico of the ruin when abandon albert to
the guid who would by no mean yield their prescript right of
carri their victim through the routin regularli laid down and as
regularli follow by them but drag the unconsci visitor to the
variou object with a pertinac that admit of no appeal
begin as a matter of cours with the lion den the hall of
the gladiat and finish with csar podium to escap a
jargon and mechan survei of the wonder by which he wa surround
franz ascend a halfdilapid staircas and leav them to
follow their monoton round seat himself at the foot of a column
and immedi opposit a larg apertur which permit him to enjoi
a full and undisturb view of the gigant dimens of the majest
ruin
franz had remain for nearli a quarter of an hour perfectli hidden by
the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a
restingplac and from whenc hi ey follow the motion of albert
and hi guid who hold torch in their hand had emerg from a
vomitorium at the opposit extrem of the colosseum and then again
disappear down the step conduct to the seat reserv for the
vestal virgin resembl as thei glide along some restless shade
follow the flicker glare of so mani ign fatui all at onc
hi ear caught a sound resembl that of a stone roll down the
staircas opposit the on by which he had himself ascend there wa
noth remark in the circumst of a fragment of granit give
wai and fall heavili below but it seem to him that the substanc
that fell gave wai beneath the pressur of a foot and also that
someon who endeavor as much as possibl to prevent hi footstep
from be heard wa approach the spot where he sat
conjectur soon becam certainti for the figur of a man wa
distinctli visibl to franz gradual emerg from the staircas
opposit upon which the moon wa at that moment pour a full tide of
silveri bright
the stranger thu present himself wa probabl a person who like
franz prefer the enjoy of solitud and hi own thought to the
frivol gabbl of the guid and hi appear had noth
extraordinari in it but the hesit with which he proceed
stop and listen with anxiou attent at everi step he took
convinc franz that he expect the arriv of some person
by a sort of instinct impuls franz withdrew as much as possibl
behind hi pillar
about ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were the roof
had given wai leav a larg round open through which might be
seen the blue vault of heaven thickli stud with star
around thi open which had possibl for ag permit a free
entranc to the brilliant moonbeam that now illumin the vast pile
grew a quantiti of creep plant whose delic green branch stood
out in bold relief against the clear azur of the firmament while
larg mass of thick strong fibrou shoot forc their wai through
the chasm and hung float to and fro like so mani wave string
the person whose mysteri arriv had attract the attent of
franz stood in a kind of halflight that render it imposs to
distinguish hi featur although hi dress wa easili made out he
wore a larg brown mantl on fold of which thrown over hi left
shoulder serv likewis to mask the lower part of hi counten
while the upper part wa complet hidden by hi broadbrim hat
the lower part of hi dress wa more distinctli visibl by the bright
rai of the moon which enter through the broken ceil shed
their refulg beam on feet case in elegantli made boot of polish
leather over which descend fashion cut trouser of black cloth
20135m
from the imperfect mean franz had of judg he could onli come to
on conclusionthat the person whom he wa thu watch certainli
belong to no inferior station of life
some few minut had elaps and the stranger began to show manifest
sign of impati when a slight nois wa heard outsid the apertur
in the roof and almost immedi a dark shadow seem to obstruct
the flood of light that had enter it and the figur of a man wa
clearli seen gaze with eager scrutini on the immens space beneath
him then as hi ey caught sight of him in the mantl he grasp a
float mass of thickli mat bough and glide down by their help
to within three or four feet of the ground and then leap lightli on
hi feet the man who had perform thi dare act with so much
indiffer wore the transtever costum
i beg your excel pardon for keep you wait said the man

sai these word the transteverin disappear down the staircas
while hi companion muffl hi featur more close than befor in
the fold of hi mantl pass almost close to franz and descend to
the arena by an outward flight of step the next minut franz heard
himself call by albert who made the lofti build reecho with the
sound of hi friend name franz howev did not obei the summon
till he had satisfi himself that the two men whose convers he
had overheard were at a suffici distanc to prevent hi encount
them in hi descent in ten minut after the stranger had depart
franz wa on the road to the piazza di spagna listen with studi
indiffer to the learn dissert deliv by albert after the
manner of plini and calpurniu touch the ironpoint net us to
prevent the feroci beast from spring on the spectat
franz let him proce without interrupt and in fact did not hear
what wa said he long to be alon and free to ponder over all that
had occur on of the two men whose mysteri meet in the
colosseum he had so unintention wit wa an entir stranger
to him but not so the other and though franz had been unabl to
distinguish hi featur from hi be either wrap in hi mantl
or obscur by the shadow the tone of hi voic had made too power
an impress on him the first time he had heard them for him ever
again to forget them hear them when or where he might it wa more
especi when thi man wa speak in a manner half jest half
bitter that franz ear recal most vividli the deep sonor yet
wellpitch voic that had address him in the grotto of mont
cristo and which he heard for the second time amid the dark and
ruin grandeur of the colosseum and the more he thought the more
entir wa hi convict that the person who wore the mantl wa no
other than hi former host and entertain sinbad the sailor
20139m
under ani other circumst franz would have found it imposs to
resist hi extrem curios to know more of so singular a personag
and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaint but
in the present instanc the confidenti natur of the convers he
had overheard made him with proprieti judg that hi appear at
such a time would be anyth but agreeabl as we have seen
therefor he permit hi former host to retir without attempt a
recognit but fulli promis himself a rich indemn for hi
present forbear should chanc afford him anoth opportun
in vain did franz endeavor to forget the mani perplex thought which
assail him in vain did he court the refresh of sleep slumber
refus to visit hi eyelid and the night wa pass in feverish
contempl of the chain of circumst tend to prove the
ident of the mysteri visit to the colosseum with the
inhabit of the grotto of mont cristo and the more he thought the
firmer grew hi opinion on the subject
worn out at length he fell asleep at daybreak and did not awak till
late like a genuin frenchman albert had emploi hi time in
arrang for the even divers he had sent to engag a box at
the teatro argentina and franz have a number of letter to write
relinquish the carriag to albert for the whole of the dai
at five oclock albert return delight with hi dai work he had
been occupi in leav hi letter of introduct and had receiv
in return more invit to ball and rout than it would be possibl
for him to accept besid thi he had seen as he call it all the
remark sight at rome ye in a singl dai he had accomplish
what hi more seriousmind companion would have taken week to
effect neither had he neglect to ascertain the name of the piec to
be plai that night at the teatro argentina and also what perform
appear in it the opera of parisina wa announc for
represent and the princip actor were coselli moriani and la
specchia
the young men therefor had reason to consid themselv fortun
in have the opportun of hear on of the best work by the
compos of lucia di lammermoor support by three of the most
renown vocalist of itali
albert had never been abl to endur the italian theatr with their
orchestra from which it is imposs to see and the absenc of
balconi or open box all these defect press hard on a man who
had had hi stall at the bouff and had share a lower box at the
opera still in spite of thi albert displai hi most dazzl and
effect costum each time he visit the theatr but ala hi
eleg toilet wa wholli thrown awai and on of the most worthi
repres of parisian fashion had to carri with him the
mortifi reflect that he had nearli overrun itali without meet
with a singl adventur
sometim albert would affect to make a joke of hi want of success
but intern he wa deepli wound and hi selflov immens
piqu to think that albert de morcerf the most admir and most
sought after of ani young person of hi dai should thu be pass
over and mere have hi labor for hi pain and the thing wa so
much the more annoi as accord to the characterist modesti of
a frenchman albert had quit pari with the full convict that he
had onli to show himself in itali to carri all befor him and that
upon hi return he should astonish the parisian world with the recit
of hi numer loveaffair
ala poor albert none of those interest adventur fell in hi
wai the love genoes florentin and neapolitan were all
faith if not to their husband at least to their lover and
thought not of chang even for the splendid appear of albert de
morcerf and all he gain wa the pain convict that the ladi
of itali have thi advantag over those of franc that thei ar
faith even in their infidel
yet he could not restrain a hope that in itali as elsewher there
might be an except to the gener rule
albert besid be an eleg welllook young man wa also
possess of consider talent and abil moreov he wa a
viscounta recent creat on certainli but in the present dai it
is not necessari to go as far back as noah in trace a descent and a
genealog tree is equal estim whether date from 1399 or
mere 1815 but to crown all these advantag albert de morcerf
command an incom of 50000 livr a more than suffici sum to
render him a personag of consider import in pari it wa
therefor no small mortif to him to have visit most of the
princip citi in itali without have excit the most trifl
observ
albert howev hope to indemnifi himself for all these slight and
indiffer dure the carniv know full well that among the
differ state and kingdom in which thi festiv is celebr
rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual
rigid of their live and deign to mingl in the folli of thi
time of liberti and relax the carniv wa to commenc on the
morrow therefor albert had not an instant to lose in set forth
the programm of hi hope expect and claim to notic
with thi design he had engag a box in the most conspicu part of
the theatr and exert himself to set off hi person attract by
the aid of the most rich and elabor toilet the box taken by albert
wa in the first circl although each of the three tier of box is
deem equal aristocrat and is for thi reason gener style
the nobil box and although the box engag for the two
friend wa suffici capaci to contain at least a dozen person
it had cost less than would be paid at some of the french theatr for
on admit mere four occup
anoth motiv had influenc albert select of hi seatwho knew
but that thu advantag place he might not in truth attract the
notic of some fair roman and an introduct might ensu that would
procur him the offer of a seat in a carriag or a place in a princ
balconi from which he might behold the gayeti of the carniv
these unit consider made albert more live and anxiou to
pleas than he had hitherto been total disregard the busi of
the stage he lean from hi box and began attent scrutin
the beauti of each pretti woman aid by a power operaglass but
ala thi attempt to attract notic wholli fail not even curios
had been excit and it wa but too appar that the love
creatur into whose good grace he wa desir of steal were all
so much engross with themselv their lover or their own thought
that thei had not so much as notic him or the manipul of hi
glass
the truth wa that the anticip pleasur of the carniv with the
holi week that wa to succe it so fill everi fair breast as to
prevent the least attent be bestow even on the busi of the
stage the actor made their entri and exit unobserv or unthought
of at certain convent moment the spectat would suddenli
ceas their convers or rous themselv from their muse to
listen to some brilliant effort of moriani a wellexecut
recit by coselli or to join in loud applaus at the wonder
power of la specchia but that momentari excit over thei quickli
relaps into their former state of preoccup or interest
convers
toward the close of the first act the door of a box which had been
hitherto vacant wa open a ladi enter to whom franz had been
introduc in pari where inde he had imagin she still wa the
quick ey of albert caught the involuntari start with which hi friend
beheld the new arriv and turn to him he said hastili
do you know the woman who ha just enter that box
ye what do you think of her
oh she is perfectli lovelywhat a complexion and such magnific
hair is she french
no a venetian
and her name is
countess g
ah i know her by name exclaim albert she is said to possess as
much wit and clever as beauti i wa to have been present to her
when i met her at madam villefort ball
shall i assist you in repair your neglig ask franz
my dear fellow ar you realli on such good term with her as to
ventur to take me to her box
why i have onli had the honor of be in her societi and convers
with her three or four time in my life but you know that even such an
acquaint as that might warrant my do what you ask
at that instant the countess perceiv franz and gracious wave her
hand to him to which he repli by a respect inclin of the
head upon my word said albert you seem to be on excel term
with the beauti countess
you ar mistaken in think so return franz calmli but you
mere fall into the same error which lead so mani of our countrymen
to commit the most egregi blundersi mean that of judg the
habit and custom of itali and spain by our parisian notion believ
me noth is more fallaci than to form ani estim of the degre
of intimaci you mai suppos exist among person by the familiar
term thei seem upon there is a similar of feel at thi instant
between ourselv and the countessnoth more
is there inde my good fellow prai tell me is it sympathi of
heart
no of tast continu franz grave
and in what manner ha thi congeni of mind been evinc
by the countesss visit the colosseum as we did last night by
moonlight and nearli alon
you were with her then
i wa
and what did you sai to her
oh we talk of the illustri dead of whom that magnific ruin is
a gloriou monument
upon my word cri albert you must have been a veri entertain
companion alon or all but alon with a beauti woman in such a
place of sentiment as the colosseum and yet to find noth better to
talk about than the dead all i can sai is if ever i should get such a
chanc the live should be my theme
20143m
and you will probabl find your theme illchosen
but said albert break in upon hi discours never mind the
past let us onli rememb the present ar you not go to keep your
promis of introduc me to the fair subject of our remark
certainli directli the curtain fall on the stage
what a confound long time thi first act last i believ on my
soul that thei never mean to finish it
oh ye thei will onli listen to that charm final how
exquisit coselli sing hi part
but what an awkward ineleg fellow he is
well then what do you sai to la specchia did you ever see anyth
more perfect than her act
why you know my dear fellow when on ha been accustom to
malibran and sontag such singer as these dont make the same
impress on you thei perhap do on other
at least you must admir moriani style and execut
i never fanci men of hi dark ponder appear sing with a
voic like a woman
my good friend said franz turn to him while albert continu to
point hi glass at everi box in the theatr you seem determin not
to approv you ar realli too difficult to pleas
the curtain at length fell on the perform to the infinit
satisfact of the viscount of morcerf who seiz hi hat rapidli
pass hi finger through hi hair arrang hi cravat and
wristband and signifi to franz that he wa wait for him to lead
the wai
franz who had mute interrog the countess and receiv from her
a graciou smile in token that he would be welcom sought not to
retard the gratif of albert eager impati but began at
onc the tour of the hous close follow by albert who avail
himself of the few minut requir to reach the opposit side of the
theatr to settl the height and smooth of hi collar and to
arrang the lappet of hi coat thi import task wa just complet
as thei arriv at the countesss box
at the knock the door wa immedi open and the young man who
wa seat besid the countess in obedi to the italian custom
instantli rose and surrend hi place to the stranger who in
turn would be expect to retir upon the arriv of other visitor
franz present albert as on of the most distinguish young men of
the dai both as regard hi posit in societi and extraordinari
talent nor did he sai more than the truth for in pari and the
circl in which the viscount move he wa look upon and cite as a
model of perfect franz ad that hi companion deepli griev at
have been prevent the honor of be present to the countess
dure her sojourn in pari wa most anxiou to make up for it and
had request him franz to remedi the past misfortun by conduct
him to her box and conclud by ask pardon for hi presumpt in
have taken it upon himself to do so
the countess in repli bow gracefulli to albert and extend her
hand with cordial kind to franz then invit albert to take the
vacant seat besid her she recommend franz to take the next best if
he wish to view the ballet and point to the on behind her own
chair
albert wa soon deepli engross in discours upon pari and parisian
matter speak to the countess of the variou person thei both knew
there franz perceiv how complet he wa in hi element and
unwil to interfer with the pleasur he so evid felt took up
albert glass and began in hi turn to survei the audienc
sit alon in the front of a box immedi opposit but situat
on the third row wa a woman of exquisit beauti dress in a greek
costum which evid from the eas and grace with which she wore
it wa her nation attir behind her but in deep shadow wa the
outlin of a masculin figur but the featur of thi latter
personag it wa not possibl to distinguish franz could not forbear
break in upon the appar interest convers pass
between the countess and albert to inquir of the former if she knew
who wa the fair albanian opposit sinc beauti such as her wa well
worthi of be observ by either sex
all i can tell about her repli the countess is that she ha
been at rome sinc the begin of the season for i saw her where she
now sit the veri first night of the season and sinc then she ha
never miss a perform sometim she is accompani by the person
who is now with her and at other she is mere attend by a black
servant
and what do you think of her person appear
oh i consid her perfectli lovelysh is just my idea of what medora
must have been
franz and the countess exchang a smile and then the latter resum
her convers with albert while franz return to hi previou
survei of the hous and compani the curtain rose on the ballet which
wa on of those excel specimen of the italian school admir
arrang and put on the stage by henri who ha establish for himself
a great reput throughout itali for hi tast and skill in the
choreograph arton of those masterli product of grace method
and eleg in which the whole corp de ballet from the princip
dancer to the humblest supernumerari ar all engag on the stage at
the same time and a hundr and fifti person mai be seen exhibit
the same attitud or elev the same arm or leg with a simultan
movement that would lead you to suppos that but on mind on act of
volit influenc the move mass
the ballet wa call poliska
howev much the ballet might have claim hi attent franz wa too
deepli occupi with the beauti greek to take ani note of it while
she seem to experi an almost childlik delight in watch it
her eager anim look contrast strongli with the utter
indiffer of her companion who dure the whole time the piec
last never even move not even when the furiou crash din
produc by the trumpet cymbal and chines bell sound their
loudest from the orchestra of thi he took no heed but wa as far as
appear might be trust enjoi soft repos and bright celesti
dream
the ballet at length came to a close and the curtain fell amid the
loud unanim plaudit of an enthusiast and delight audienc
ow to the veri judici plan of divid the two act of the opera
with a ballet the paus between the perform ar veri short the
singer in the opera have time to repos themselv and chang their
costum when necessari while the dancer ar execut their
pirouett and exhibit their grace step
the overtur to the second act began and at the first sound of the
leader bow across hi violin franz observ the sleeper slowli aris
and approach the greek girl who turn around to sai a few word to
him and then lean forward again on the rail of her box she
becam as absorb as befor in what wa go on
the counten of the person who had address her remain so
complet in the shade that though franz tri hi utmost he could
not distinguish a singl featur the curtain rose and the attent
of franz wa attract by the actor and hi ey turn from the box
contain the greek girl and her strang companion to watch the
busi of the stage
most of my reader ar awar that the second act of parisina open
with the celebr and effect duet in which parisina while
sleep betrai to azzo the secret of her love for ugo the injur
husband goe through all the emot of jealousi until convict
seiz on hi mind and then in a frenzi of rage and indign he
awaken hi guilti wife to tell her that he know her guilt and to
threaten her with hi vengeanc
thi duet is on of the most beauti express and terribl
concept that ha ever eman from the fruit pen of donizetti
franz now listen to it for the third time yet it note so tenderli
express and fearfulli grand as the wretch husband and wife give
vent to their differ grief and passion thrill through the soul
of franz with an effect equal to hi first emot upon hear it
excit beyond hi usual calm demeanor franz rose with the audienc
and wa about to join the loud enthusiast applaus that follow
but suddenli hi purpos wa arrest hi hand fell by hi side and
the halfutt bravo expir on hi lip
the occup of the box in which the greek girl sat appear to share
the univers admir that prevail for he left hi seat to stand
up in front so that hi counten be fulli reveal franz had
no difficulti in recogn him as the mysteri inhabit of mont
cristo and the veri same person he had encount the preced
even in the ruin of the colosseum and whose voic and figur had
seem so familiar to him
all doubt of hi ident wa now at an end hi singular host
evid resid at rome the surpris and agit occas by
thi full confirm of franz former suspicion had no doubt
impart a correspond express to hi featur for the countess
after gaze with a puzzl look at hi face burst into a fit of
laughter and beg to know what had happen

ey onli for the man we love
true repli franz
all i can sai is continu the countess take up the lorgnett
and direct it toward the box in question that the gentleman whose
histori i am unabl to furnish seem to me as though he had just been
dug up he look more like a corps permit by some friendli
gravedigg to quit hi tomb for a while and revisit thi earth of
our than anyth human how ghastli pale he is
oh he is alwai as colorless as you now see him said franz
then you know him almost scream the countess oh prai do for
heaven sake tell us all abouti he a vampir or a resuscit
corps or what

and i can well understand said the countess shrug up her
beauti shoulder as though an involuntari shudder pass through
her vein that those who have onc seen that man will never be like
to forget him
the sensat experienc by franz wa evid not peculiar to
himself anoth and wholli uninterest person felt the same
unaccount aw and misgiv
well inquir franz after the countess had a second time direct
her lorgnett at the box what do you think of our opposit
neighbor
20147m
why that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in a live form
thi fresh allus to byron5 drew a smile to franz counten
although he could but allow that if anyth wa like to induc
belief in the exist of vampir it would be the presenc of such a
man as the mysteri personag befor him
i must posit find out who and what he is said franz rise
from hi seat
no no cri the countess you must not leav me i depend upon you
to escort me home oh inde i cannot permit you to go

belief in the exist of vampir and even assur me that he had
seen them the descript he gave me perfectli correspond with the
featur and charact of the man befor us oh he is the exact
personif of what i have been led to expect the coalblack hair
larg bright glitter ey in which a wild unearthli fire seem
burningth same ghastli pale then observ too that the woman
with him is altogeth unlik all other of her sex she is a
foreignera stranger nobodi know who she is or where she come from
no doubt she belong to the same horribl race he doe and is like
himself a dealer in magic art i entreat of you not to go near
himat least tonight and if tomorrow your curios still continu as
great pursu your research if you will but tonight you neither can
nor shall for that purpos i mean to keep you all to myself
franz protest he could not defer hi pursuit till the follow dai
for mani reason
listen to me said the countess and do not be so veri headstrong i
am go home i have a parti at my hous tonight and therefor cannot
possibl remain till the end of the opera now i cannot for on
instant believ you so devoid of gallantri as to refus a ladi your
escort when she even condescend to ask you for it
there wa noth els left for franz to do but to take up hi hat
open the door of the box and offer the countess hi arm it wa quit
evid by her manner that her uneasi wa not feign and franz
himself could not resist a feel of superstiti dreadso much the
stronger in him as it aros from a varieti of corrobor
recollect while the terror of the countess sprang from an
instinct belief origin creat in her mind by the wild tale
she had listen to till she believ them truth franz could even
feel her arm trembl as he assist her into the carriag upon
arriv at her hotel franz perceiv that she had deceiv him when
she spoke of expect compani on the contrari her own return befor
the appoint hour seem greatli to astonish the servant
excus my littl subterfug said the countess in repli to her
companion halfreproach observ on the subject but that
horrid man had made me feel quit uncomfort and i long to be
alon that i might compos my startl mind
franz essai to smile
nai said she do not smile it ill accord with the express of
your counten and i am sure it doe not spring from your heart
howev promis me on thing
what is it
promis me i sai
i will do anyth you desir except relinquish my determin of
find out who thi man is i have more reason than you can imagin
for desir to know who he is from whenc he came and whither he is
go
where he come from i am ignor but i can readili tell you where he
is go to and that is down below without the least doubt
let us onli speak of the promis you wish me to make said franz
well then you must give me your word to return immedi to your
hotel and make no attempt to follow thi man tonight there ar
certain affin between the person we quit and those we meet
afterward for heaven sake do not serv as a conductor between that
man and me pursu your chase after him tomorrow as eagerli as you
pleas but never bring him near me if you would not see me die of
terror and now goodnight go to your room and try to sleep awai
all recollect of thi even for my own part i am quit sure i
shall not be abl to close my ey
so sai the countess quit franz leav him unabl to decid
whether she were mere amus herself at hi expens or whether her
fear and agit were genuin
upon hi return to the hotel franz found albert in hi dressinggown
and slipper listlessli extend on a sofa smoke a cigar
my dear fellow cri he spring up is it realli you why i did
not expect to see you befor tomorrow
my dear albert repli franz i am glad of thi opportun to tell
you onc and forev that you entertain a most erron notion
concern italian women i should have thought the continu failur
you have met with in all your own love affair might have taught you
better by thi time
upon my soul these women would puzzl the veri devil to read them
aright why herethei give you their handthei press your in
returnthei keep up a whisper conversationpermit you to accompani
them home why if a parisian were to indulg in a quarter of these
mark of flatter attent her reput would be gone forev
and the veri reason why the women of thi fine countri where sound
the si as dant write put so littl restraint on their word and
action is becaus thei live so much in public and have realli
noth to conceal besid you must have perceiv that the countess
wa realli alarm
at what at the sight of that respect gentleman sit opposit
to us in the same box with the love greek girl now for my part i

descent and distinguish breed

busi can be manag the cart must be tastefulli ornament and if
you and i dress ourselv as neapolitan reaper we mai get up a
strike tableau after the manner of that splendid pictur by lopold
robert it would add greatli to the effect if the countess would join
us in the costum of a peasant from puzzoli or sorrento our group
would then be quit complet more especi as the countess is quit
beauti enough to repres a madonna
well said franz thi time m albert i am bound to give you
credit for have hit upon a most capit idea
and quit a nation on too repli albert with gratifi pride

would be easier than to furnish all i desir on thing i wa sorri
for when i bade him have the horn of the oxen gild he told me

pastrini in a tone indic of unbound selfconfid
but what have you done ask franz speak out there a worthi
fellow
your excel ar awar respond the landlord swell with
import that the count of mont cristo is live on the same floor
with yourselv
i should think we did know it exclaim albert sinc it is ow
to that circumst that we ar pack into these small room like
two poor student in the back street of pari
when then the count of mont cristo hear of the dilemma in which
you ar place ha sent to offer you seat in hi carriag and two
place at hi window in the palazzo rospoli the friend look at
each other with unutter surpris
but do you think ask albert that we ought to accept such offer
from a perfect stranger
what sort of person is thi count of mont cristo ask franz of hi
host
a veri great nobleman but whether maltes or sicilian i cannot
exactli sai but thi i know that he is nobl as a borghes and rich
as a gold mine
it seem to me said franz speak in an underton to albert that
if thi person merit the high panegyr of our landlord he would
have convei hi invit through anoth channel and not permit
it to be brought to us in thi unceremoni wai he would have
writtenor
at thi instant someon knock at the door
come in said franz

appear at the threshold and place two card in the landlord
hand who forthwith present them to the two young men he said
pleas to deliv these from the count of mont cristo to vicomt

here
tell the count repli franz that we will do ourselv the
pleasur of call on him
the servant bow and retir
that is what i call an eleg mode of attack said albert you were
quit correct in what you said signor pastrini the count of mont
cristo is unquestion a man of firstrat breed and knowledg of
the world
then you accept hi offer said the host
of cours we do repli albert still i must own i am sorri to be
oblig to give up the cart and the group of reapersit would have
produc such an effect and were it not for the window at the palazzo
rospoli by wai of recompens for the loss of our beauti scheme i
dont know but what i should have held on by my origin plan what sai
you franz
oh i agre with you the window in the palazzo rospoli alon decid
me
the truth wa that the mention of two place in the palazzo rospoli
had recal to franz the convers he had overheard the preced
even in the ruin of the colosseum between the mysteri unknown
and the transteverin in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken
to obtain the freedom of a condemn crimin and if thi muffledup
individu prove as franz felt sure he would the same as the person
he had just seen in the teatro argentina then he should be abl to
establish hi ident and also to prosecut hi research respect
him with perfect facil and freedom
franz pass the night in confus dream respect the two meet
he had alreadi had with hi mysteri tormentor and in wake
specul as to what the morrow would produc the next dai must
clear up everi doubt and unless hi near neighbor and wouldb friend
the count of mont cristo possess the ring of gyge and by it
power wa abl to render himself invis it wa veri certain he
could not escap thi time
eight oclock found franz up and dress while albert who had not the
same motiv for earli rise wa still soundli asleep the first act
of franz wa to summon hi landlord who present himself with hi
accustom obsequi
prai signor pastrini ask franz is not some execut appoint
to take place todai

procur a window to view it from you ar much too late

in the same tone with which he would have read a newspap that
todai the 23rd of februari will be execut andrea rondolo guilti of
murder on the person of the respect and vener don csar torlini
canon of the church of st john lateran and peppino call rocca
priori convict of complic with the detest bandit luigi vampa
and the men of hi band
hum the first will be mazzolato the second decapitato ye
continu the count it wa at first arrang in thi wai but i think
sinc yesterdai some chang ha taken place in the order of the
ceremoni
realli said franz
ye i pass the even at the cardin rospigliosi and there
mention wa made of someth like a pardon for on of the two men
for andrea rondolo ask franz
no repli the count carelessli for the other he glanc at the
tablet as if to recal the name for peppino call rocca priori
you ar thu depriv of see a man guillotin but the mazzolata
still remain which is a veri curiou punish when seen for the
first time and even the second while the other as you must know is
veri simpl the mandaa6 never fail never trembl never strike
thirti time ineffectu like the soldier who behead the count of
chalai and to whose tender merci richelieu had doubtless recommend
the suffer ah ad the count in a contemptu tone do not
tell me of european punish thei ar in the infanc or rather the
old ag of cruelti
realli count repli franz on would think that you had studi
the differ tortur of all the nation of the world
there ar at least few that i have not seen said the count coldli
and you took pleasur in behold these dread spectacl
my first sentiment wa horror the second indiffer the third
curios
curiositythat is a terribl word
why so in life our greatest preoccup is death is it not then
curiou to studi the differ wai by which the soul and bodi can
part and how accord to their differ charact tempera
and even the differ custom of their countri differ person
bear the transit from life to death from exist to annihil
as for myself i can assur you of on thingth more men you see die
the easier it becom to die yourself and in my opinion death mai be
a tortur but it is not an expiat
i do not quit understand you repli franz prai explain your
mean for you excit my curios to the highest pitch
listen said the count and deep hatr mount to hi face as the
blood would to the face of ani other if a man had by unheardof and
excruci tortur destroi your father your mother your
betrotheda be who when torn from you left a desol a wound
that never close in your breastdo you think the repar that
societi give you is suffici when it interpos the knife of the
guillotin between the base of the occiput and the trapez muscl of
the murder and allow him who ha caus us year of moral
suffer to escap with a few moment of physic pain
ye i know said franz that human justic is insuffici to
consol us she can give blood in return for blood that is all but
you must demand from her onli what it is in her power to grant
i will put anoth case to you continu the count that where
societi attack by the death of a person aveng death by death but
ar there not a thousand tortur by which a man mai be made to suffer
without societi take the least cogniz of them or offer him
even the insuffici mean of vengeanc of which we have just spoken
ar there not crime for which the impal of the turk the auger
of the persian the stake and the brand of the iroquoi indian ar
inadequ tortur and which ar unpunish by societi answer me do
not these crime exist
ye answer franz and it is to punish them that duell is
toler
ah duell cri the count a pleasant manner upon my soul of
arriv at your end when that end is vengeanc a man ha carri off
your mistress a man ha seduc your wife a man ha dishonor your
daughter he ha render the whole life of on who had the right to
expect from heaven that portion of happi god ha promis to
everyon of hi creatur an exist of miseri and infami and you
think you ar aveng becaus you send a ball through the head or pass
a sword through the breast of that man who ha plant mad in your
brain and despair in your heart and rememb moreov that it is
often he who come off victori from the strife absolv of all
crime in the ey of the world no no continu the count had i to
aveng myself it is not thu i would take reveng
then you disapprov of duell you would not fight a duel ask
albert in hi turn astonish at thi strang theori
oh ye repli the count understand me i would fight a duel for
a trifl for an insult for a blow and the more so that thank to my
skill in all bodili exercis and the indiffer to danger i have
gradual acquir i should be almost certain to kill my man oh i
would fight for such a caus but in return for a slow profound
etern tortur i would give back the same were it possibl an ey
for an ey a tooth for a tooth as the orientalist sayour master
in everythingthos favor creatur who have form for themselv a
life of dream and a paradis of realiti
but said franz to the count with thi theori which render you at
onc judg and execution of your own caus it would be difficult to
adopt a cours that would forev prevent your fall under the power
of the law hatr is blind rage carri you awai and he who pour
out vengeanc run the risk of tast a bitter draught
ye if he be poor and inexperienc not if he be rich and skil
besid the worst that could happen to him would be the punish of
which we have alreadi spoken and which the philanthrop french
revolut ha substitut for be torn to piec by hors or broken
on the wheel what matter thi punish as long as he is aveng
on my word i almost regret that in all probabl thi miser
peppino will not be behead as you might have had an opportun then
of see how short a time the punish last and whether it is
worth even mention but realli thi is a most singular convers
for the carniv gentlemen how did it aris ah i recollect you
ask for a place at my window you shall have it but let us first sit
down to tabl for here come the servant to inform us that breakfast
is readi
as he spoke a servant open on of the four door of the apart
sai
al suo commodo
the two young men aros and enter the breakfastroom
dure the meal which wa excel and admir serv franz
look repeatedli at albert in order to observ the impress which
he doubt not had been made on him by the word of their entertain
but whether with hi usual careless he had paid but littl
attent to him whether the explan of the count of mont cristo
with regard to duell had satisfi him or whether the event which
franz knew of had had their effect on him alon he remark that hi
companion did not pai the least regard to them but on the contrari at
like a man who for the last four or five month had been condemn to
partak of italian cookerythat is the worst in the world
as for the count he just touch the dish he seem to fulfil the
duti of a host by sit down with hi guest and await their
departur to be serv with some strang or more delic food thi
brought back to franz in spite of himself the recollect of the
terror with which the count had inspir the countess g and her firm
convict that the man in the opposit box wa a vampir
at the end of the breakfast franz took out hi watch
well said the count what ar you do

ask how do thei execut at rome and you repli i do not know
and besid thei sai that the culprit is an infam scoundrel who
kill with a log of wood a worthi canon who had brought him up like
hi own son diabl when a churchman is kill it should be with a
differ weapon than a log especi when he ha behav like a
father if you went to spain would you not see the bullfight well
suppos it is a bullfight you ar go to see recollect the ancient
roman of the circu and the sport where thei kill three hundr
lion and a hundr men think of the eighti thousand applaud

wholli absorb by the spectacl that the piazza del popolo present

ridicul appear than ever and which gain them the applaus of
franz and albert albert had fasten the fade bunch of violet to hi

corso by the via vittoria
at the second turn a bunch of fresh violet thrown from a carriag

friend the peasant had chang their costum also and whether it wa
the result of chanc or whether a similar feel had possess them
both while he had don their costum thei had assum hi
albert place the fresh bouquet in hi buttonhol but he kept the

ladi who had thrown it but her joyou companion also the dai wa as
gai as the preced on perhap even more anim and noisi the

absenc the extrem kind of the fair peasant in rais her mask
franz wa not suffici egotist to stop albert in the middl of
an adventur that promis to prove so agreeabl to hi curios and
so flatter to hi vaniti he felt assur that the perfect
indiscret of hi friend would duli inform him of all that happen
and as dure three year that he had travel all over itali a
similar piec of good fortun had never fallen to hi share franz wa
by no mean sorri to learn how to act on such an occas he therefor
promis albert that he would content himself the morrow with
wit the carniv from the window of the rospoli palac
the next morn he saw albert pass and repass hold an enorm
bouquet which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of hi amor
epistl thi belief wa chang into certainti when franz saw the

franz then relat to hi friend the histori of hi excurs to the
island of mont cristo and of hi find a parti of smuggler there
and the two corsican bandit with them he dwelt with consider
forc and energi on the almost magic hospit he had receiv from
the count and the magnific of hi entertain in the grotto of
the thousand and on night
he recount with circumstanti exactitud all the particular of
the supper the hashish the statu the dream and how at hi
awaken there remain no proof or trace of all these event save
the small yacht seen in the distant horizon drive under full sail
toward portovecchio
then he detail the convers overheard by him at the colosseum
between the count and vampa in which the count had promis to obtain
the releas of the bandit peppinoan engag which as our reader
ar awar he most faithfulli fulfil
at last he arriv at the adventur of the preced night and the
embarrass in which he found himself place by not have suffici
cash by six or seven hundr piastr to make up the sum requir and
final of hi applic to the count and the picturesqu and
satisfactori result that follow albert listen with the most
profound attent
well said he when franz had conclud what do you find to object
to in all you have relat the count is fond of travel and be
rich possess a vessel of hi own go but to portsmouth or
southampton and you will find the harbor crowd with the yacht
belong to such of the english as can afford the expens and have
the same like for thi amus now by wai of have a
restingplac dure hi excurs avoid the wretch
cookerywhich ha been try it best to poison me dure the last
four month while you have manfulli resist it effect for as mani
yearsand obtain a bed on which it is possibl to slumber mont
cristo ha furnish for himself a temporari abod where you first
found him but to prevent the possibl of the tuscan govern
take a fanci to hi enchant palac and therebi depriv him of
the advantag natur expect from so larg an outlai of capit
he ha wise enough purchas the island and taken it name just ask
yourself my good fellow whether there ar not mani person of our
acquaint who assum the name of land and properti thei never in
their live were master of
but said franz the corsican bandit that were among the crew of
hi vessel
why realli the thing seem to me simpl enough nobodi know better
than yourself that the bandit of corsica ar not rogu or thiev
but pure and simpli fugit driven by some sinist motiv from
their nativ town or villag and that their fellowship involv no
disgrac or stigma for my own part i protest that should i ever go
to corsica my first visit er even i present myself to the mayor or
prefect should be to the bandit of colomba if i could onli manag to
find them for on my conscienc thei ar a race of men i admir
greatli
still persist franz i suppos you will allow that such men as
vampa and hi band ar regular villain who have no other motiv than
plunder when thei seiz your person how do you explain the influenc
the count evid possess over those ruffian
my good friend as in all probabl i own my present safeti to that
influenc it would ill becom me to search too close into it
sourc therefor instead of condemn him for hi intimaci with
outlaw you must give me leav to excus ani littl irregular there
mai be in such a connect not altogeth for preserv my life for
my own idea wa that it never wa in much danger but certainli for
save me 4000 piastr which be translat mean neither more
nor less than 24000 livr of our moneya sum at which most
assuredli i should never have been estim in franc prove most
indisput ad albert with a laugh that no prophet is honor
in hi own countri
talk of countri repli franz of what countri is the count
what is hi nativ tongu whenc doe he deriv hi immens fortun
and what were those event of hi earli lifea life as marvel as
unknownthat have tinctur hi succeed year with so dark and
gloomi a misanthropi certainli these ar question that in your
place i should like to have answer
my dear franz repli albert when upon receipt of my letter you
found the necess of ask the count assist you promptli went
to him sai my friend albert de morcerf is in danger help me to
deliv him wa not that nearli what you said
20222m

no he mere came and freed me from the hand of signor vampa where
i can assur you in spite of all my outward appear of eas and
unconcern i did not veri particularli care to remain now then
franz when for servic so promptli and unhesitatingli render he
but ask me in return to do for him what is done daili for ani russian
princ or italian nobleman who mai pass through parismer to
introduc him into societywould you have me refus my good fellow
you must have lost your sens to think it possibl i could act with
such coldblood polici
and thi time it must be confess that contrari to the usual state of
affair in discuss between the young men the effect argument
were all on albert side
well said franz with a sigh do as you pleas my dear viscount for
your argument ar beyond my power of refut still in spite of
all you must admit that thi count of mont cristo is a most singular
personag
he is a philanthropist answer the other and no doubt hi motiv
in visit pari is to compet for the monthyon prize given as you
ar awar to whoever shall be prove to have most materi advanc
the interest of virtu and human if my vote and interest can
obtain it for him i will readili give him the on and promis the

we shall sit down to tabl
chapter 40 the breakfast

a gentleman and a diplomatist
then we shall have to wait two hour for the gentleman and three for
the diplomatist i shall come back to dessert keep me some
strawberri coffe and cigar i shall take a cutlet on my wai to
the chamber
do not do anyth of the sort for were the gentleman a montmor
and the diplomatist a metternich we will breakfast at eleven in the
meantim follow debrai exampl and take a glass of sherri and a
biscuit
be it so i will stai i must do someth to distract my thought
you ar like debrai and yet it seem to me that when the minist is
out of spirit the opposit ought to be joyou
ah you do not know with what i am threaten i shall hear thi
morn that m danglar make a speech at the chamber of deputi and
at hi wife thi even i shall hear the tragedi of a peer of
franc the devil take the constitut govern and sinc we had

between myself and mlle eugni danglar i cannot in conscienc
therefor let you run down the speech of a man who will on dai sai
to me vicomt you know i give my daughter two million
ah thi marriag will never take place said beauchamp the king
ha made him a baron and can make him a peer but he cannot make him a
gentleman and the count of morcerf is too aristocrat to consent for
the paltri sum of two million franc to a msallianc the viscount
of morcerf can onli wed a marchio
but two million franc make a nice littl sum repli morcerf
it is the social capit of a theatr on the boulevard or a railroad
from the jardin de plant to la rpe
never mind what he sai morcerf said debrai do you marri her you
marri a moneybag label it is true well but what doe that matter
it is better to have a blazon less and a figur more on it you have
seven martlet on your arm give three to your wife and you will
still have four that is on more than m de guis had who so nearli
becam king of franc and whose cousin wa emperor of germani

chteaurenaud a man whose name is franz dpinai or albert de

and thei apolog to him for have carri you off said
beauchamp
just so
why he is a second ariosto
no hi name is the count of mont cristo
there is no count of mont cristo said debrai
i do not think so ad chteaurenaud with the air of a man who
know the whole of the european nobil perfectli
doe anyon know anyth of a count of mont cristo
he come possibl from the holi land and on of hi ancestor
possess calvari as the mortemart did the dead sea
i think i can assist your research said maximilian mont cristo
is a littl island i have often heard spoken of by the old sailor my
father employeda grain of sand in the centr of the mediterranean an
atom in the infinit
precis cri albert well he of whom i speak is the lord and
master of thi grain of sand of thi atom he ha purchas the titl
of count somewher in tuscani
he is rich then
i believ so
but that ought to be visibl
that is what deceiv you debrai
i do not understand you
have you read the arabian night
what a question
well do you know if the person you see there ar rich or poor if
their sack of wheat ar not rubi or diamond thei seem like poor
fishermen and suddenli thei open some mysteri cavern fill with
the wealth of the indi
which mean
which mean that my count of mont cristo is on of those fishermen
he ha even a name taken from the book sinc he call himself sinbad
the sailor and ha a cave fill with gold
and you have seen thi cavern morcerf ask beauchamp
no but franz ha for heaven sake not a word of thi befor him
franz went in with hi ey blindfold and wa wait on by mute and
by women to whom cleopatra wa a paint strumpet onli he is not quit
sure about the women for thei did not come in until after he had taken
hashish so that what he took for women might have been simpli a row of
statu
the two young men look at morcerf as if to sayar you mad or ar
you laugh at us
and i also said morrel thoughtfulli have heard someth like thi
from an old sailor name penelon
ah cri albert it is veri lucki that m morrel come to aid me
you ar vex ar you not that he thu give a clew to the
labyrinth
my dear albert said debrai what you tell us is so extraordinari
ah becaus your ambassador and your consul do not tell you of
themthei have no time thei ar too much taken up with interf in
the affair of their countrymen who travel
now you get angri and attack our poor agent how will you have them
protect you the chamber cut down their salari everi dai so that

the count of mont cristo
pardieu everyon exist

he must be a vampir
laugh if you will the countess g who knew lord ruthven declar
that the count wa a vampir

newspap here is the pendant to the famou seaserp of the
constitutionnel

debrai facial angl strongli develop magnific forehead livid
complexion black beard sharp and white teeth polit
unexception
just so lucien return morcerf you have describ him featur
for featur ye keen and cut polit thi man ha often made
me shudder and on dai when we were view an execut i thought i
should faint more from hear the cold and calm manner in which he
spoke of everi descript of tortur than from the sight of the
execution and the culprit
did he not conduct you to the ruin of the colosseum and suck your
blood ask beauchamp
or have deliv you make you sign a flame parchment
surrend your soul to him as esau did hi birthright
rail on rail on at your eas gentlemen said morcerf somewhat
piqu when i look at you parisian idler on the boulevard de gand
or the boi de boulogn and think of thi man it seem to me we ar
not of the same race
i am highli flatter return beauchamp
at the same time ad chteaurenaud your count of mont cristo

continu beauchamp
but the sound of the clock had not di awai when germain announc
hi excel the count of mont cristo the involuntari start
everyon gave prove how much morcerf narr had impress them
and albert himself could not wholli refrain from manifest sudden
emot he had not heard a carriag stop in the street or step in
the antechamb the door had itself open noiselessli the count
appear dress with the greatest simplic but the most fastidi
dandi could have found noth to cavil at in hi toilet everi articl
of dresshat coat glove and bootswa from the first maker he
seem scarc fiveandthirti but what struck everybodi wa hi
extrem resembl to the portrait debrai had drawn the count
advanc smile into the centr of the room and approach albert
who hasten toward him hold out hi hand in a ceremoni manner
punctual said mont cristo is the polit of king
accord to on of your sovereign i think but it is not the same
with travel howev i hope you will excus the two or three
second i am behindhand five hundr leagu ar not to be
accomplish without some troubl and especi in franc where it
seem it is forbidden to beat the postilion
my dear count repli albert i wa announc your visit to some

editor of a paper and the terror of the french govern but of
whom in spite of hi nation celebr you perhap have not heard in
itali sinc hi paper is prohibit there and m maximilian morrel
captain of spahi
at thi name the count who had hitherto salut everyon with
courtesi but at the same time with cold and formal step a
pace forward and a slight ting of red color hi pale cheek
you wear the uniform of the new french conqueror monsieur said he
it is a handsom uniform
no on could have said what caus the count voic to vibrat so
deepli and what made hi ey flash which wa in gener so clear
lustrou and limpid when he pleas
you have never seen our african count said albert
never repli the count who wa by thi time perfectli master of
himself again
well beneath thi uniform beat on of the bravest and noblest heart
in the whole armi

a new deed of hi and so heroic a on that although i have seen him
todai for the first time i request you to allow me to introduc him as
my friend
at these word it wa still possibl to observ in mont cristo the
concentr look chang color and slight trembl of the eyelid
that show emot
ah you have a nobl heart said the count so much the better
thi exclam which correspond to the count own thought rather
than to what albert wa sai surpris everybodi and especi
morrel who look at mont cristo with wonder but at the same time
the inton wa so soft that howev strang the speech might seem
it wa imposs to be offend at it
20245m
why should he doubt it said beauchamp to chteaurenaud
in realiti repli the latter who with hi aristocrat glanc and
hi knowledg of the world had penetr at onc all that wa
penetr in mont cristo albert ha not deceiv us for the count

a great man in everi countri m debrai said chteaurenaud
the count wa it mai be rememb a most temper guest albert
remark thi express hi fear lest at the outset the parisian
mode of life should displeas the travel in the most essenti
point
my dear count said he i fear on thing and that is that the fare
of the rue du helder is not so much to your tast as that of the piazza
di spagna i ought to have consult you on the point and have had
some dish prepar expressli
did you know me better return the count smile you would not
give on thought of such a thing for a travel like myself who ha
success live on macaroni at napl polenta at milan olla
podrida at valencia pilau at constantinopl curri in india and

ye repli morcerf he said someth about it to me
but said beauchamp who as becam a journalist wa veri
incredul you alwai carri thi drug about you

would it be an indiscret to ask to see those preciou pill
continu beauchamp hope to take him at a disadvantag
no monsieur return the count and he drew from hi pocket a
marvel casket form out of a singl emerald and close by a
golden lid which unscrew and gave passag to a small greenish color
pellet about the size of a pea thi ball had an acrid and penetr
odor there were four or five more in the emerald which would contain
about a dozen the casket pass around the tabl but it wa more to
examin the admir emerald than to see the pill that it pass from
hand to hand
and is it your cook who prepar these pill ask beauchamp
oh no monsieur repli mont cristo i do not thu betrai my
enjoy to the vulgar i am a toler chemist and prepar my
pill myself

though not so fine given by the emperor napoleon to hi predecessor
piu vii i kept the third for myself and i had it hollow out which
reduc it valu but render it more commodi for the purpos i
intend
everyon look at mont cristo with astonish he spoke with so
much simplic that it wa evid he spoke the truth or that he wa
mad howev the sight of the emerald made them natur inclin to
the former belief
and what did these two sovereign give you in exchang for these
magnific present ask debrai

him that you obtain pardon
perhap return the count smile
my dear count you have no idea what pleasur it give me to hear you
speak thu said morcerf i had announc you beforehand to my

ag but the parisian ar so subtl in paradox that thei mistak
for capric of the imagin the most incontest truth when
these truth do not form a part of their daili exist for exampl
here is debrai who read and beauchamp who print everi dai a
member of the jockei club ha been stop and rob on the
boulevard four person have been assassin in the rue st deni
or the faubourg st germain ten fifteen or twenti thiev have

yourself that i wa taken by bandit and that without your gener
intercess i should now have been sleep in the catacomb of st

helder
ah said mont cristo you promis me never to mention that
circumst
it wa not i who made that promis cri morcerf it must have been
someon els whom you have rescu in the same manner and whom you
have forgotten prai speak of it for i shall not onli i trust relat

now i mistook for thi peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or
sixteen with a beardless chin and slim waist and who just as i wa
about to imprint a chast salut on hi lip place a pistol to my
head and aid by seven or eight other led or rather drag me
to the catacomb of st sebastian where i found a highli educ
brigand chief perus csar commentari and who deign to leav
off read to inform me that unless the next morn befor six
oclock four thousand piastr were paid into hi account at hi
banker at a quarter past six i should have ceas to exist the

did not recollect me he sought to take me but on the contrari it
wa i who captur him and a dozen of hi band i might have hand him
over to roman justic which is somewhat expediti and which would
have been particularli so with him but i did noth of the sorti
suffer him and hi band to depart

as she wa in 1830 the countess had thi portrait paint dure the
count absenc she doubtless intend give him an agreeabl
surpris but strang to sai thi portrait seem to displeas my
father and the valu of the pictur which is as you see on of the
best work of lopold robert could not overcom hi dislik to it it
is true between ourselv that m de morcerf is on of the most
assidu peer at the luxembourg a gener renown for theori but a
most mediocr amateur of art it is differ with my mother who
paint exceedingli well and who unwil to part with so valuabl a
pictur gave it to me to put here where it would be less like to
displeas m de morcerf whose portrait by gro i will also show you

those of my father but thei ar as you see join to anoth shield
which ha gule a silver tower which ar my mother by her side i
am spanish but the famili of morcerf is french and i have heard on

arm pilgrim that went to the holi land took for their arm either a
cross in honor of their mission or bird of passag in sign of the
long voyag thei were about to undertak and which thei hope to
accomplish on the wing of faith on of your ancestor had join the

it would have requir the penetr of dipu or the sphinx to have
divin the ironi the count conceal beneath these word appar
utter with the greatest polit morcerf thank him with a smile
and push open the door abov which were hi arm and which as we
have said open into the salon in the most conspicu part of the
salon wa anoth portrait it wa that of a man from five to

ribbon of the legion of honor around hi neck which show he wa a

charl iii which prove that the person repres by the pictur
had serv in the war of greec and spain or what wa just the same
thing as regard decor had fulfil some diplomat mission in
the two countri
mont cristo wa engag in examin thi portrait with no less care
than he had bestow upon the other when anoth door open and he
found himself opposit to the count of morcerf in person
he wa a man of forti to fortyf year but he seem at least
fifti and hi black moustach and eyebrow contrast strang with
hi almost white hair which wa cut short in the militari fashion he
wa dress in plain cloth and wore at hi buttonhol the ribbon
of the differ order to which he belong
he enter with a toler dignifi step and some littl hast
mont cristo saw him advanc toward him without make a singl step
it seem as if hi feet were root to the ground and hi ey on the

father said the young man i have the honor of present to you
the count of mont cristo the gener friend whom i had the good
fortun to meet in the critic situat of which i have told you

mont cristo in take the seat morcerf offer him place himself in
such a manner as to remain conceal in the shadow of the larg velvet
curtain and read on the careworn and livid featur of the count a
whole histori of secret grief written in each wrinkl time had plant

monsieur made a peer at the restor i serv through the first
campaign under the order of marshal bourmont i could therefor
expect a higher rank and who know what might have happen had the

the count is a man of veri high distinct
hi manner ar admir said the countess at least as far as i
could judg in the few minut he remain here
thei ar perfect mother so perfect that thei surpass by far all i
have known in the lead aristocraci of the three proudest nobil
of europeth english the spanish and the german

you have seen my dear alberti ask the question as a mothery have
seen m de mont cristo in hi hous you ar quicksight have much
knowledg of the world more tact than is usual at your ag do you

the countess bent her head as if beneath a heavi wave of bitter
thought
and ha thi man displai a friendship for you albert she ask

therefor perforc be remark
he went down to the stabl not without some slight annoy when he

what cri i do you a magistr speak thu to me
all these corsican ar mad on my honor repli m de villefort
thei fanci that their countryman is still emperor you have mistaken
the time you should have told me thi two month ago it is too late
now go now at onc or i shall have you put out
i look at him an instant to see if there wa anyth to hope from
further entreati but he wa a man of stone i approach him and said
in a low voic well sinc you know the corsican so well you know
that thei alwai keep their word you think that it wa a good deed to
kill my brother who wa a bonapartist becaus you ar a royalist
well i who am a bonapartist also declar on thing to you which is
that i will kill you from thi moment i declar the vendetta against
you so protect yourself as well as you can for the next time we meet
your last hour ha come and befor he had recov from hi
surpris i open the door and left the room
well well said mont cristo such an innoc look person as
you ar to do those thing m bertuccio and to a king attornei at
that but did he know what wa meant by the terribl word vendetta
he knew so well that from that moment he shut himself in hi hous
and never went out unattend seek me high and low fortun i
wa so well conceal that he could not find me then he becam
alarm and dare not stai ani longer at nme so he solicit a
chang of resid and as he wa in realiti veri influenti he wa
nomin to versail but as you know a corsican who ha sworn to
aveng himself care not for distanc so hi carriag fast as it
went wa never abov half a dai journei befor me who follow him
on foot the most import thing wa not to kill him onlyfor i had
an opportun of do so a hundr timesbut to kill him without
be discoveredat least without be arrest i no longer belong
to myself for i had my sisterinlaw to protect and provid for
for three month i watch m de villefort for three month he took
not a step outofdoor without my follow him at length i
discov that he went mysteri to auteuil i follow him
thither and i saw him enter the hous where we now ar onli instead
of enter by the great door that look into the street he came on
horseback or in hi carriag left the on or the other at the littl
inn and enter by the gate you see there
mont cristo made a sign with hi head to show that he could discern in
the dark the door to which bertuccio allud
as i had noth more to do at versail i went to auteuil and
gain all the inform i could if i wish to surpris him it wa
evid thi wa the spot to lie in wait for him the hous belong
as the concierg inform your excel to m de saintmran
villefort fatherinlaw m de saintmran live at marseil so
that thi countri hous wa useless to him and it wa report to be
let to a young widow known onli by the name of the baro
on even as i wa look over the wall i saw a young and
handsom woman who wa walk alon in that garden which wa not
overlook by ani window and i guess that she wa await m de
villefort when she wa suffici near for me to distinguish her
featur i saw she wa from eighteen to nineteen tall and veri fair
as she had a loos muslin dress on and as noth conceal her figur
i saw she would er long becom a mother a few moment after the
littl door wa open and a man enter the young woman hasten to
meet him thei threw themselv into each other arm embrac
tenderli and return togeth to the hous the man wa m de
villefort i fulli believ that when he went out in the night he would
be forc to travers the whole of the garden alon
20291m
and ask the count did you ever know the name of thi woman
no excel return bertuccio you will see that i had no time
to learn it
go on
that even continu bertuccio i could have kill the
procureur but as i wa not suffici acquaint with the
neighborhood i wa fear of not kill him on the spot and that if
hi cri were overheard i might be taken so i put it off until the
next occas and in order that noth should escap me i took a
chamber look into the street border by the wall of the garden
three dai after about seven oclock in the even i saw a servant
on horseback leav the hous at full gallop and take the road to
svre i conclud that he wa go to versail and i wa not
deceiv three hour later the man return cover with dust hi
errand wa perform and two minut after anoth man on foot
muffl in a mantl open the littl door of the garden which he
close after him i descend rapidli although i had not seen
villefort face i recogn him by the beat of my heart i
cross the street and stop at a post place at the angl of the
wall and by mean of which i had onc befor look into the garden
thi time i did not content myself with look but i took my knife
out of my pocket felt that the point wa sharp and sprang over the
wall my first care wa to run to the door he had left the kei in it
take the simpl precaut of turn it twice in the lock noth
then prevent my escap by thi mean i examin the ground the
garden wa long and narrow a stretch of smooth turf extend down the
middl and at the corner were clump of tree with thick and massi
foliag that made a background for the shrub and flower in order to
go from the door to the hous or from the hous to the door m de
villefort would be oblig to pass by on of these clump of tree
20293m
it wa the end of septemb the wind blew violent the faint
glimps of the pale moon hidden momentarili by mass of dark cloud
that were sweep across the sky whiten the gravel walk that led
to the hous but were unabl to pierc the obscur of the thick
shrubberi in which a man could conceal himself without ani fear of
discoveri i hid myself in the on nearest to the path villefort must
take and scarc wa i there when amidst the gust of wind i
fanci i heard groan but you know or rather you do not know your
excel that he who is about to commit an assassin fanci
that he hear low cri perpetu ring in hi ear two hour
pass thu dure which i imagin i heard moan repeatedli midnight
struck as the last stroke di awai i saw a faint light shine through
the window of the privat staircas by which we have just descend
the door open and the man in the mantl reappear
the terribl moment had come but i had so long been prepar for it
that my heart did not fail in the least i drew my knife from my pocket
again open it and made readi to strike the man in the mantl
advanc toward me but as he drew near i saw that he had a weapon in
hi hand i wa afraid not of a struggl but of a failur when he
wa onli a few pace from me i saw that what i had taken for a weapon
wa onli a spade i wa still unabl to divin for what reason m de
villefort had thi spade in hi hand when he stop close to the
thicket where i wa glanc round and began to dig a hole in the
earth i then perceiv that he wa hide someth under hi mantl
which he laid on the grass in order to dig more freeli then i
confess curios mingl with hatr i wish to see what villefort
wa go to do there and i remain motionless hold my breath
then an idea cross my mind which wa confirm when i saw the
procureur lift from under hi mantl a box two feet long and six or
eight inch deep i let him place the box in the hole he had made
then while he stamp with hi feet to remov all trace of hi
occup i rush on him and plung my knife into hi breast
exclaim
i am giovanni bertuccio thy death for my brother thy treasur for
hi widow thou seest that my vengeanc is more complet than i had
hope
i know not if he heard these word i think he did not for he fell
without a cry i felt hi blood gush over my face but i wa
intox i wa deliri and the blood refresh instead of
burn me in a second i had disint the box then that it might
not be known i had done so i fill up the hole threw the spade over
the wall and rush through the door which i doublelock carri
off the kei
ah said mont cristo it seem to me thi wa noth but murder and
robberi
no your excel return bertuccio it wa a vendetta follow
by restitut
and wa the sum a larg on
it wa not monei
ah i recollect repli the count did you not sai someth of an
infant
ye excel i hasten to the river sat down on the bank and
with my knife forc open the lock of the box in a fine linen cloth
wa wrap a newborn child it purpl visag and it violetcolor
hand show that it had perish from suffoc but as it wa not
yet cold i hesit to throw it into the water that ran at my feet
after a moment i fanci that i felt a slight pulsat of the heart
and as i had been assist at the hospit at bastia i did what a
doctor would have donei inflat the lung by blow air into them
and at the expir of a quarter of an hour it began to breath and
cri feebli in my turn i utter a cry but a cry of joi
god ha not curs me then i cri sinc he permit me to save
the life of a human creatur in exchang for the life i have taken
awai
20295m
and what did you do with the child ask mont cristo it wa an
embarrass load for a man seek to escap
i had not for a moment the idea of keep it but i knew that at
pari there wa an asylum where thei receiv such creatur as i
pass the citi gate i declar that i had found the child on the
road and i inquir where the asylum wa the box confirm my
statement the linen prove that the infant belong to wealthi
parent the blood with which i wa cover might have proceed from
the child as well as from anyon els no object wa rais but
thei point out the asylum which wa situat at the upper end of the
rue denfer and after have taken the precaut of cut the linen
in two piec so that on of the two letter which mark it wa on
the piec wrap around the child while the other remain in my
possess i rang the bell and fled with all speed a fortnight after
i wa at rogliano and i said to assunta
consol thyself sister israel is dead but he is aveng
she demand what i meant and when i had told her allgiovanni
said she you should have brought thi child with you we would have
replac the parent it ha lost have call it benedetto and then
in consequ of thi good action god would have bless us in
repli i gave her the half of the linen i had kept in order to reclaim
him if we becam rich
what letter were mark on the linen said mont cristo

bellegard to beaucair at the sign of the pont du gard we had thu
at aiguesmort martigu or bouc a dozen place where we left our

gendarm and customhous offic smuggl is a profit trade
when a certain degre of vigor and intellig is emploi as for

the past and in my past life thei might find someth far more grave
than the sell of smuggl cigar or barrel of brandi without a

cotton and we ran our cargo without opposit and return home
full of joi when i enter the hous the first thing i beheld in the
middl of assunta chamber wa a cradl that might be call sumptuou
compar with the rest of the furnitur and in it a babi seven or
eight month old i utter a cry of joi the onli moment of sad i
had known sinc the assassin of the procureur were caus by the
recollect that i had abandon thi child for the assassin
itself i had never felt ani remors poor assunta had guess all she

confess your excel when i saw thi poor creatur sleep
peacefulli in it cradl i felt my ey fill with tear ah
assunta cri i you ar an excel woman and heaven will bless
you
thi said mont cristo is less correct than your philosophyit is
onli faith
ala your excel is right repli bertuccio and god made thi
infant the instrument of our punish never did a pervers natur
declar itself more prematur and yet it wa not ow to ani fault
in hi bring up he wa a most love child with larg blue ey
of that deep color that harmon so well with the blond complexion
onli hi hair which wa too light gave hi face a most singular
express and ad to the vivac of hi look and the malic of
hi smile
unfortun there is a proverb which sai that red is either
altogeth good or altogeth bad the proverb wa but too correct as
regard benedetto and even in hi infanc he manifest the worst
disposit it is true that the indulg of hi fostermoth
encourag him thi child for whom my poor sister would go to the
town five or six leagu off to purchas the earliest fruit and the
most tempt sweetmeat prefer to palma grape or genoes
preserv the chestnut stolen from a neighbor orchard or the dri
appl in hi loft when he could eat as well of the nut and appl
that grew in my garden
on dai when benedetto wa about five or six our neighbor wasilio
who accord to the custom of the countri never lock up hi purs
or hi valuablesfor as your excel know there ar no thiev in
corsicacomplain that he had lost a loui out of hi purs we
thought he must have made a mistak in count hi monei but he
persist in the accuraci of hi statement on dai benedetto who had
been gone from the hous sinc morn to our great anxieti did not
return until late in the even drag a monkei after him which he
said he had found chain to the foot of a tree for more than a month
past the mischiev child who knew not what to wish for had taken
it into hi head to have a monkei a boatman who had pass by
rogliano and who had sever of these anim whose trick had
greatli divert him had doubtless suggest thi idea to him
monkei ar not found in our wood chain to tree said i confess
how you obtain thi anim benedetto maintain the truth of what
he had said and accompani it with detail that did more honor to hi
imagin than to hi verac i becam angri he began to laugh i
threaten to strike him and he made two step backward you cannot
beat me said he you have no right for you ar not my father
20299m
we never knew who had reveal thi fatal secret which we had so
carefulli conceal from him howev it wa thi answer in which the
child whole charact reveal itself that almost terrifi me and
my arm fell without touch him
the boi triumph and thi victori render him so audaci that
all the monei of assunta whose affect for him seem to increas as
he becam more unworthi of it wa spent in capric she knew not how
to contend against and folli she had not the courag to prevent
when i wa at rogliano everyth went on properli but no sooner wa
my back turn than benedetto becam master and everyth went ill
when he wa onli eleven he chose hi companion from among the young
men of eighteen or twenti the worst charact in bastia or inde
in corsica and thei had alreadi for some mischiev prank been
sever time threaten with a prosecut i becam alarm as ani
prosecut might be attend with seriou consequ i wa
compel at thi period to leav corsica on an import expedit
i reflect for a long time and with the hope of avert some
impend misfortun i resolv that benedetto should accompani me
i hope that the activ and labori life of a smuggler with the
sever disciplin on board would have a salutari effect on hi
charact which wa now wellnigh if not quit corrupt i spoke to
benedetto alon and propos to him to accompani me endeavor to
tempt him by all the promis most like to dazzl the imagin of
a child of twelv he heard me patient and when i had finish
burst out laugh
ar you mad uncl he call me by thi name when he wa in good
humor do you think i am go to chang the life i lead for your
mode of existencemi agreeabl indol for the hard and precari
toil you impos on yourself expos to the bitter frost at night and
the scorch heat by dai compel to conceal yourself and when you
ar perceiv receiv a vollei of bullet all to earn a paltri sum
why i have as much monei as i want mother assunta alwai furnish me
when i ask for it you see that i should be a fool to accept your
offer
the argument and hi audac perfectli stupefi me benedetto
rejoin hi associ and i saw him from a distanc point me out to
them as a fool
sweet child murmur mont cristo
oh had he been my own son repli bertuccio or even my nephew i
would have brought him back to the right road for the knowledg that
you ar do your duti give you strength but the idea that i wa
strike a child whose father i had kill made it imposs for me
to punish him i gave my sister who constantli defend the
unfortun boi good advic and as she confess that she had sever
time miss monei to a consider amount i show her a safe place
in which to conceal our littl treasur for the futur my mind wa
alreadi made up benedetto could read write and cipher perfectli for
when the fit seiz him he learn more in a dai than other in a
week my intent wa to enter him as a clerk in some ship and
without let him know anyth of my plan to convei him some
morn on board by thi mean hi futur treatment would depend upon
hi own conduct i set off for franc after have fix upon the
plan our cargo wa to be land in the gulf of lyon and thi wa a
difficult thing to do becaus it wa then the year 1829 the most
perfect tranquil wa restor and the vigil of the
customhous offic wa redoubl and their strict wa increas
at thi time in consequ of the fair at beaucair
20301m
our expedit made a favor begin we anchor our

number of other vessel that border the bank of the rhne from
beaucair to arl on our arriv we began to discharg our cargo in
the night and to convei it into the town by the help of the innkeep
with whom we were connect
whether success render us imprud or whether we were betrai i
know not but on even about five oclock our littl cabinboi
came breathlessli to inform us that he had seen a detach of
customhous offic advanc in our direct it wa not their

along the bank of the rhne but the care accord to the boi
account that thei took to avoid be seen in an instant we were on
the alert but it wa too late our vessel wa surround and amongst
the customhous offic i observ sever gendarm and as
terrifi at the sight of their uniform as i wa brave at the sight of
ani other i sprang into the hold open a port and drop into the
river dive and onli rose at interv to breath until i reach a
ditch that had recent been made from the rhne to the canal that run
from beaucair to aiguesmort i wa now safe for i could swim along
the ditch without be seen and i reach the canal in safeti i had
designedli taken thi direct i have alreadi told your excel of
an innkeep from nme who had set up a littl tavern on the road from
bellegard to beaucair

never enter by the door that open onto the road i resolv not to
break through the rule so climb over the gardenhedg i crept
amongst the oliv and wild fig tree and fear that caderouss might
have some guest i enter a kind of shed in which i had often pass
the night and which wa onli separ from the inn by a partit in
which hole had been made in order to enabl us to watch an opportun
of announc our presenc
my intent wa if caderouss wa alon to acquaint him with my
presenc finish the meal the customhous offic had interrupt
and profit by the threaten storm to return to the rhne and
ascertain the state of our vessel and it crew i step into the
shed and it wa fortun i did so for at that moment caderouss
enter with a stranger
i wait patient not to overhear what thei said but becaus i
could do noth els besid the same thing had occur often
befor the man who wa with caderouss wa evid a stranger to the
south of franc he wa on of those merchant who come to sell
jewelleri at the beaucair fair and who dure the month the fair
last and dure which there is so great an influx of merchant and
custom from all part of europ often have deal to the amount
of 100000 to 150000 franc caderouss enter hastili then see
that the room wa as usual empti and onli guard by the dog he
call to hi wife hello carcont said he the worthi priest ha
not deceiv us the diamond is real
an exclam of joi wa heard and the staircas creak beneath a
feebl step what do you sai ask hi wife pale as death
i sai that the diamond is real and that thi gentleman on of the
first jewel of pari will give us 50000 franc for it onli in
order to satisfi himself that it realli belong to us he wish you to
relat to him as i have done alreadi the miracul manner in which
the diamond came into our possess in the meantim pleas to sit
down monsieur and i will fetch you some refresh
the jewel examin attent the interior of the inn and the
appar poverti of the person who were about to sell him a diamond
that seem to have come from the casket of a princ
relat your stori madam said he wish no doubt to profit by
the absenc of the husband so that the latter could not influenc the
wife stori to see if the two recit talli
oh return she it wa a gift of heaven my husband wa a great
friend in 1814 or 1815 of a sailor name edmond dant thi poor
fellow whom caderouss had forgotten had not forgotten him and at
hi death he bequeath thi diamond to him
but how did he obtain it ask the jewel had he it befor he
wa imprison
no monsieur but it appear that in prison he made the acquaint
of a rich englishman and as in prison he fell sick and dant took
the same care of him as if he had been hi brother the englishman
when he wa set free gave thi stone to dant who less fortun
di and in hi turn left it to us and charg the excel abb
who wa here thi morn to deliv it
the same stori mutter the jewel and improb as it seem
at first it mai be true there onli the price we ar not agre
about
how not agre about said caderouss i thought we agre for the
price i ask
that is repli the jewel i offer 40000 franc
forti thousand cri la carcont we will not part with it for that
sum the abb told us it wa worth 50000 without the set
what wa the abb name ask the indefatig question
the abb busoni said la carcont
he wa a foreign
an italian from the neighborhood of mantua i believ
let me see thi diamond again repli the jewel the first time
you ar often mistaken as to the valu of a stone
caderouss took from hi pocket a small case of black shagreen
open and gave it to the jewel at the sight of the diamond which
wa as larg as a hazelnut la carcont ey sparkl with
cupid
and what did you think of thi fine stori eavesdropp said mont
cristo did you credit it
ye your excel i did not look on caderouss as a bad man and i
thought him incap of commit a crime or even a theft
that did more honor to your heart than to your experi m
bertuccio had you known thi edmond dant of whom thei spoke
no your excel i had never heard of him befor and never but
onc afterward and that wa from the abb busoni himself when i saw
him in the prison at nme
go on
the jewel took the ring and draw from hi pocket a pair of
steel plier and a small set of copper scale he took the stone out of
it set and weigh it carefulli
i will give you 45000 said he but not a sou more besid as
that is the exact valu of the stone i brought just that sum with me
oh that no matter repli caderouss i will go back with you
to fetch the other 5000 franc
no return the jewel give back the diamond and the ring to
caderouss no it is worth no more and i am sorri i offer so much
for the stone ha a flaw in it which i had not seen howev i will
not go back on my word and i will give 45000
at least replac the diamond in the ring said la carcont sharpli
ah true repli the jewel and he reset the stone
no matter observ caderouss replac the box in hi pocket
someon els will purchas it
ye continu the jewel but someon els will not be so easi
as i am or content himself with the same stori it is not natur that
a man like you should possess such a diamond he will inform against
you you will have to find the abb busoni and abb who give diamond
worth two thousand loui ar rare the law would seiz it and put you
in prison if at the end of three or four month you ar set at
liberti the ring will be lost or a fals stone worth three franc
will be given you instead of a diamond worth 50000 or perhap 55000
franc from which you must allow that on run consider risk in
purchas
caderouss and hi wife look eagerli at each other
no said caderouss we ar not rich enough to lose 5000 franc
as you pleas my dear sir said the jewel i had howev as
you see brought you the monei in bright coin and he drew from hi
pocket a hand of gold and held it sparkl befor the dazzl ey
of the innkeep and in the other hand he held a packet of banknot
there wa evid a sever struggl in the mind of caderouss it
wa plain that the small shagreen case which he turn over and over
in hi hand did not seem to him commensur in valu to the enorm
sum which fascin hi gaze he turn toward hi wife
what do you think of thi he ask in a low voic
let him have itlet him have it she said if he return to
beaucair without the diamond he will inform against us and as he
sai who know if we shall ever again see the abb busoniin all
probabl we shall never see him
well then so i will said caderouss so you mai have the diamond
for 45000 franc but my wife want a gold chain and i want a pair of
silver buckl
the jewel drew from hi pocket a long flat box which contain
sever sampl of the articl demand here he said i am veri
straightforward in my dealingstak your choic
the woman select a gold chain worth about five loui and the
husband a pair of buckl worth perhap fifteen franc
i hope you will not complain now said the jewel

unmind of those whichprecursor of the stormbegan to plai in at
the window

three crown of six livr each which in all probabl form the

sedul avoid the sight of hi guest but as soon as the stranger
had complet hi repast the agit innkeep went eagerli to the
door and open it
i believ the storm is over said he
but as if to contradict hi statement at that instant a violent clap
of thunder seem to shake the hous to it veri foundat while a
sudden gust of wind mingl with rain extinguish the lamp he held
in hi hand
trembl and awestruck caderouss hastili shut the door and
return to hi guest while la carcont light a candl by the
smoulder ash that glimmer on the hearth
you must be tire said she to the jewel i have spread a pair
of white sheet on your bed go up when you ar readi and sleep well
joann stai for a while to see whether the storm seem to abat in
it furi but a brief space of time suffic to assur him that
instead of diminish the violenc of the rain and thunder
momentarili increas resign himself therefor to what seem
inevit he bade hi host goodnight and mount the stair he
pass over my head and i heard the floor creak beneath hi
footstep the quick eager glanc of la carcont follow him as he
ascend while caderouss on the contrari turn hi back and
seem most anxious to avoid even glanc at him
all these circumst did not strike me as painfulli at the time as
thei have sinc done in fact all that had happen with the
except of the stori of the diamond which certainli did wear an air
of improb appear natur enough and call for neither
apprehens nor mistrust but worn out as i wa with fatigu and
fulli purpos to proce onward directli the tempest abat i
determin to obtain a few hour sleep overhead i could accur
distinguish everi movement of the jewel who after make the best
arrang in hi power for pass a comfort night threw
himself on hi bed and i could hear it creak and groan beneath hi
weight
insens my eyelid grew heavi deep sleep stole over me and have
no suspicion of anyth wrong i sought not to shake it off i look
into the kitchen onc more and saw caderouss sit by the side of a
long tabl upon on of the low wooden stool which in countri place
ar frequent us instead of chair hi back wa turn toward me
so that i could not see the express of hi countenanceneith
should i have been abl to do so had he been place differ as hi
head wa buri between hi two hand la carcont continu to gaze on
him for some time then shrug her shoulder she took her seat
immedi opposit to him
at thi moment the expir ember threw up a fresh flame from the
kindl of a piec of wood that lai near and a bright light flash
over the room la carcont still kept her ey fix on her husband
but as he made no sign of chang hi posit she extend her hard
boni hand and touch him on the forehead
20317m
caderouss shudder the woman lip seem to move as though she
were talk but becaus she mere spoke in an underton or my
sens were dull by sleep i did not catch a word she utter
confus sight and sound seem to float befor me and gradual i
fell into a deep heavi slumber how long i had been in thi
unconsci state i know not when i wa suddenli arous by the report
of a pistol follow by a fear cry weak and totter footstep
resound across the chamber abov me and the next instant a dull
heavi weight seem to fall powerless on the staircas i had not yet
fulli recov conscious when again i heard groan mingl with
halfstifl cri as if from person engag in a deadli struggl a
cry more prolong than the other and end in a seri of groan
effectu rous me from my drowsi lethargi hastili rais myself
on on arm i look around but all wa dark and it seem to me as
if the rain must have penetr through the floor of the room
abov for some kind of moistur appear to fall drop by drop upon
my forehead and when i pass my hand across my brow i felt that it
wa wet and clammi
to the fear nois that had awaken me had succeed the most
perfect silenceunbroken save by the footstep of a man walk about
in the chamber abov the staircas creak he descend into the room
below approach the fire and lit a candl
the man wa caderousseh wa pale and hi shirt wa all bloodi
have obtain the light he hurri upstair again and onc more i
heard hi rapid and uneasi footstep
a moment later he came down again hold in hi hand the small
shagreen case which he open to assur himself it contain the
diamondseem to hesit as to which pocket he should put it in
then as if dissatisfi with the secur of either pocket he
deposit it in hi red handkerchief which he carefulli roll round
hi head
after thi he took from hi cupboard the banknot and gold he had
put there thrust the on into the pocket of hi trouser and the
other into that of hi waistcoat hastili ti up a small bundl of
linen and rush toward the door disappear in the dark of the
night
then all becam clear and manifest to me and i reproach myself with
what had happen as though i myself had done the guilti deed i
fanci that i still heard faint moan and imagin that the
unfortun jewel might not be quit dead i determin to go to hi
relief by wai of aton in some slight degre not for the crime i
had commit but for that which i had not endeavor to prevent for
thi purpos i appli all the strength i possess to forc an
entranc from the cramp spot in which i lai to the adjoin room
the poorli fasten board which alon divid me from it yield to my
effort and i found myself in the hous hastili snatch up the
light candl i hurri to the staircas about midwai a bodi wa
ly quit across the stair it wa that of la carcont the pistol i
had heard had doubtless been fire at her the shot had frightfulli
lacer her throat leav two gape wound from which as well as
the mouth the blood wa pour in flood she wa stone dead i
strode past her and ascend to the sleep chamber which present
an appear of the wildest disord the furnitur had been knock
over in the deadli struggl that had taken place there and the sheet
to which the unfortun jewel had doubtless clung were drag
across the room the murder man lai on the floor hi head lean
against the wall and about him wa a pool of blood which pour forth
from three larg wound in hi breast there wa a fourth gash in
which a long tabl knife wa plung up to the handl
i stumbl over some object i stoop to examineit wa the second
pistol which had not gone off probabl from the powder be wet i
approach the jewel who wa not quit dead and at the sound of my
footstep and the creak of the floor he open hi ey fix them
on me with an anxiou and inquir gaze move hi lip as though
try to speak then overcom by the effort fell back and expir
thi appal sight almost bereft me of my sens and find that i
could no longer be of servic to anyon in the hous my onli desir
wa to fly i rush toward the staircas clutch my hair and
utter a groan of horror
upon reach the room below i found five or six customhous
offic and two or three gendarmesal heavili arm thei threw
themselv upon me i made no resist i wa no longer master of my
sens when i strove to speak a few inarticul sound alon escap
my lip
as i notic the signific manner in which the whole parti point
to my bloodstain garment i involuntarili survei myself and then
i discov that the thick warm drop that had so bedew me as i lai
beneath the staircas must have been the blood of la carcont i
point to the spot where i had conceal myself

i confess thi is the drollest thing i have ever met with in the cours
of my extens foreign transact and you mai readili suppos it

caprici beauti i made inquiri and found that the hous in the
champslys is hi own properti and certainli it wa veri decent
kept up but pursu danglar with on of hi sinist smile an
order for unlimit credit call for someth like caution on the part
of the banker to whom that order is given i am veri anxiou to see
thi man i suspect a hoax is intend but the instig of it
littl knew whom thei had to deal with thei laugh best who laugh

have deliv himself of thi pompou address utter with a degre
of energi that left the baron almost out of breath he bow to the
assembl parti and withdrew to hi drawingroom whose sumptuou
furnish of white and gold had caus a great sensat in the
chauss dantin it wa to thi apart he had desir hi guest to
be shown with the purpos of overwhelm him at the sight of so much
luxuri he found the count stand befor some copi of albano and
fattor that had been pass off to the banker as origin but which
mere copi as thei were seem to feel their degrad in be
brought into juxtaposit with the gaudi color that cover the
ceil
the count turn round as he heard the entranc of danglar into the
room with a slight inclin of the head danglar sign to the
count to be seat point significantli to a gild armchair
cover with white satin embroid with gold the count sat down
20335m
i have the honor i presum of address m de mont cristo
the count bow
and i of speak to baron danglar chevali of the legion of honor
and member of the chamber of deputi
mont cristo repeat all the titl he had read on the baron card
danglar felt the ironi and compress hi lip
you will i trust excus me monsieur for not call you by your
titl when i first address you he said but you ar awar that we
ar live under a popular form of govern and that i am myself a
repres of the liberti of the peopl
so much so repli mont cristo that while you call yourself baron
you ar not will to call anybodi els count
upon my word monsieur said danglar with affect careless i
attach no sort of valu to such empti distinct but the fact is i
wa made baron and also chevali of the legion of honor in return
for servic render but
but you have discard your titl after the exampl set you by
messr de montmor and lafayett that wa a nobl exampl to
follow monsieur
why repli danglar not entir so with the servantsy
understand
i see to your domest you ar my lord the journalist style you
monsieur while your constitu call you citizen these ar
distinct veri suitabl under a constitut govern i
understand perfectli
again danglar bit hi lip he saw that he wa no match for mont
cristo in an argument of thi sort and he therefor hasten to turn
to subject more congeni
permit me to inform you count said he bow that i have
receiv a letter of advic from thomson french of rome
i am glad to hear it baronfor i must claim the privileg of
address you after the manner of your servant i have acquir the
bad habit of call person by their titl from live in a countri
where baron ar still baron by right of birth but as regard the
letter of advic i am charm to find that it ha reach you that
will spare me the troublesom and disagre task of come to you
for monei myself you have receiv a regular letter of advic
ye said danglar but i confess i didnt quit comprehend it
mean
inde
and for that reason i did myself the honor of call upon you in
order to beg for an explan
go on monsieur here i am readi to give you ani explan you
desir
why said danglar in the letteri believ i have it about meher
he felt in hi breastpockety here it is well thi letter give
the count of mont cristo unlimit credit on our hous
well baron what is there difficult to understand about that
mere the term unlimitednoth els certainli
is not that word known in franc the peopl who wrote ar
anglogerman you know
oh as for the composit of the letter there is noth to be said
but as regard the compet of the document i certainli have
doubt
is it possibl ask the count assum all air and tone of the
utmost simplic and candor is it possibl that thomson french ar
not look upon as safe and solvent banker prai tell me what you
think baron for i feel uneasi i can assur you have some
consider properti in their hand
thomson french ar perfectli solvent repli danglar with an
almost mock smile but the word unlimit in financi affair
is so extrem vagu
is in fact unlimit said mont cristo
precis what i wa about to sai cri danglar now what is vagu
is doubt and it wa a wise man who said when in doubt keep
out
mean to sai rejoin mont cristo that howev thomson french
mai be inclin to commit act of imprud and folli the baron
danglar is not dispos to follow their exampl
not at all
plainli enough messr thomson french set no bound to their
engag while those of m danglar have their limit he is a wise
man accord to hi own show
monsieur repli the banker draw himself up with a haughti air
the extent of my resourc ha never yet been question
it seem then reserv for me said mont cristo coldli to be the
first to do so
by what right sir
by right of the object you have rais and the explan you
have demand which certainli must have some motiv
onc more danglar bit hi lip it wa the second time he had been
worst and thi time on hi own ground hi forc polit sat
awkwardli upon him and approach almost to impertin mont cristo
on the contrari preserv a grace suaviti of demeanor aid by a
certain degre of simplic he could assum at pleasur and thu
possess the advantag
well sir resum danglar after a brief silenc i will endeavor
to make myself understood by request you to inform me for what sum
you propos to draw upon me
why truli repli mont cristo determin not to lose an inch of
the ground he had gain my reason for desir an unlimit credit
wa precis becaus i did not know how much monei i might need
the banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand so
throw himself back in hi armchair he said with an arrog and
purseproud air
let me beg of you not to hesit in name your wish you will then
be convinc that the resourc of the hous of danglar howev
limit ar still equal to meet the largest demand and were you
even to requir a million
i beg your pardon interpos mont cristo
i said a million repli danglar with the confid of ignor
but could i do with a million retort the count my dear sir if a
trifl like that could suffic me i should never have given myself the
troubl of open an account a million excus my smile when you
speak of a sum i am in the habit of carri in my pocketbook or
dressingcas
and with these word mont cristo took from hi pocket a small case
contain hi visitingcard and drew forth two order on the
treasuri for 500000 franc each payabl at sight to the bearer a man
like danglar wa wholli inaccess to ani gentler method of
correct the effect of the present revel wa stun he
trembl and wa on the verg of apoplexi the pupil of hi ey as
he gaze at mont cristo dilat horribl
come come said mont cristo confess honestli that you have not
perfect confid in thomson french i understand and forese
that such might be the case i took in spite of my ignor of
affair certain precaut see here ar two similar letter to that
you have yourself receiv on from the hous of arstein eskel of
vienna to baron rothschild the other drawn by bare of london upon
m lafitt now sir you have but to sai the word and i will spare
you all uneasi by present my letter of credit to on or other of
these two firm
the blow had struck home and danglar wa entir vanquish with a
trembl hand he took the two letter from the count who held them
carelessli between finger and thumb and proceed to scrutin the
signatur with a minut that the count might have regard as
insult had it not suit hi present purpos to mislead the banker
oh sir said danglar after he had convinc himself of the
authent of the document he held and rise as if to salut the
power of gold personifi in the man befor himthre letter of
unlimit credit i can be no longer mistrust but you must pardon
me my dear count for confess to some degre of astonish
nai answer mont cristo with the most gentlemanli air ti not
for such trifl sum as these that your bank hous is to be
incommod then you can let me have some monei can you not
whatev you sai my dear count i am at your order
why repli mont cristo sinc we mutual understand each
otherfor such i presum is the case danglar bow assentingli you
ar quit sure that not a lurk doubt or suspicion linger in your
mind
oh my dear count exclaim danglar i never for an instant
entertain such a feel toward you
no you mere wish to be convinc noth more but now that we
have come to so clear an understand and that all distrust and
suspicion ar laid at rest we mai as well fix a sum as the probabl
expenditur of the first year suppos we sai six million to
six million gasp danglarsso be it
then if i should requir more continu mont cristo in a careless
manner why of cours i should draw upon you but my present
intent is not to remain in franc more than a year and dure that

m de villefort wa not onli a magistr he wa almost a diplomatist
hi relat with the former court of which he alwai spoke with
digniti and respect made him respect by the new on and he knew so
mani thing that not onli wa he alwai carefulli consid but
sometim consult perhap thi would not have been so had it been
possibl to get rid of m de villefort but like the feudal baron who
rebel against their sovereign he dwelt in an impregn fortress
thi fortress wa hi post as king attornei all the advantag of
which he exploit with marvel skill and which he would not have
resign but to be made deputi and thu to replac neutral by
opposit
ordinarili m de villefort made and return veri few visit hi wife
visit for him and thi wa the receiv thing in the world where
the weighti and multifari occup of the magistr were
accept as an excus for what wa realli onli calcul pride a
manifest of profess superiorityin fact the applic of the
axiom pretend to think well of yourself and the world will think
well of you an axiom a hundr time more us in societi nowadai
than that of the greek know thyself a knowledg for which in our
dai we have substitut the less difficult and more advantag
scienc of know other
to hi friend m de villefort wa a power protector to hi
enemi he wa a silent but bitter oppon for those who were
neither the on nor the other he wa a statu of the lawmad man he
had a haughti bear a look either steadi and impenetr or
insol pierc and inquisitori four success revolut had
built and cement the pedest upon which hi fortun wa base
m de villefort had the reput of be the least curiou and the
least wearisom man in franc he gave a ball everi year at which he
appear for a quarter of an hour onlythat is to sai fiveandforti
minut less than the king is visibl at hi ball he wa never seen
at the theatr at concert or in ani place of public resort
occasion but seldom he plai at whist and then care wa taken
to select partner worthi of himsometim thei were ambassador
sometim archbishop or sometim a princ or a presid or some
dowag duchess
such wa the man whose carriag had just now stop befor the count
of mont cristo door the valet de chambr announc m de villefort
at the moment when the count lean over a larg tabl wa trace
on a map the rout from st petersburg to china
the procureur enter with the same grave and measur step he would
have emploi in enter a court of justic he wa the same man or
rather the develop of the same man whom we have heretofor seen as
assist attornei at marseil natur accord to her wai had
made no deviat in the path he had mark out for himself from be
slender he had now becom meagr onc pale he wa now yellow hi
deepset ey were hollow and the gold spectacl shield hi ey
seem to be an integr portion of hi face he dress entir in
black with the except of hi white tie and hi funer appear
wa onli mitig by the slight line of red ribbon which pass almost
impercept through hi buttonhol and appear like a streak of
blood trace with a delic brush
although master of himself mont cristo scrutin with
irrepress curios the magistr whose salut he return and
who distrust by habit and especi incredul as to social
prodigi wa much more despis to look upon the nobl stranger as
mont cristo wa alreadi call as an adventur in search of new
field or an escap crimin rather than as a princ of the holi
see or a sultan of the thousand and on night
sir said villefort in the squeaki tone assum by magistr in
their orator period and of which thei cannot or will not divest
themselv in societi sir the signal servic which you yesterdai
render to my wife and son ha made it a duti for me to offer you my
thank i have come therefor to discharg thi duti and to express
to you my overwhelm gratitud
and as he said thi the ey sever of the magistr had lost
noth of it habitu arrog he spoke in a voic of the
procureurgener with the rigid inflex of neck and shoulder
which caus hi flatter to sai as we have befor observ that he
wa the live statu of the law
monsieur repli the count with a chill air i am veri happi to
have been the mean of preserv a son to hi mother for thei sai
that the sentiment of matern is the most holi of all and the good
fortun which occur to me monsieur might have enabl you to
dispens with a duti which in it discharg confer an undoubtedli
great honor for i am awar that m de villefort is not usual lavish
of the favor which he now bestow on mea favor which howev
estim is unequ to the satisfact which i have in my own
conscious
villefort astonish at thi repli which he by no mean expect
start like a soldier who feel the blow level at him over the
armor he wear and a curl of hi disdain lip indic that from
that moment he note in the tablet of hi brain that the count of
mont cristo wa by no mean a highli bred gentleman
he glanc around in order to seiz on someth on which the
convers might turn and seem to fall easili on a topic he saw
the map which mont cristo had been examin when he enter and
said
you seem geograph engag sir it is a rich studi for you who
as i learn have seen as mani land as ar delin on thi map
ye sir repli the count i have sought to make of the human
race taken in the mass what you practic everi dai on individualsa
physiolog studi i have believ it wa much easier to descend from
the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole it is an
algebra axiom which make us proce from a known to an unknown
quantiti and not from an unknown to a known but sit down sir i beg
of you
mont cristo point to a chair which the procureur wa oblig to
take the troubl to move forward himself while the count mere fell
back into hi own on which he had been kneel when m villefort
enter thu the count wa halfwai turn toward hi visitor have
hi back toward the window hi elbow rest on the geograph
chart which furnish the theme of convers for the momenta
convers which assum as in the case of the interview with
danglar and morcerf a turn analog to the person if not to the
situat
ah you philosoph repli villefort after a moment silenc
dure which like a wrestler who encount a power oppon he
took breath well sir realli if like you i had noth els to
do i should seek a more amus occup
why in truth sir wa mont cristo repli man is but an ugli
caterpillar for him who studi him through a solar microscop but you
said i think that i had noth els to do now realli let me ask
sir have youdo you believ you have anyth to do or to speak in
plain term do you realli think that what you do deserv be call
anyth
villefort astonish redoubl at thi second thrust so forcibl
made by hi strang adversari it wa a long time sinc the magistr
had heard a paradox so strong or rather to sai the truth more
exactli it wa the first time he had ever heard of it the procureur
exert himself to repli
sir he respond you ar a stranger and i believ you sai
yourself that a portion of your life ha been spent in orient
countri so you ar not awar how human justic so expediti in
barbar countri take with us a prudent and wellstudi cours
oh yesy i do sir it is the pede claudo of the ancient i
know all that for it is with the justic of all countri especi
that i have occupi myselfit is with the crimin procedur of all
nation that i have compar natur justic and i must sai sir that
it is the law of primit nation that is the law of retali
that i have most frequent found to be accord to the law of god
if thi law were adopt sir said the procureur it would greatli
simplifi our legal code and in that case the magistr would not
as you just observ have much to do
it mai perhap come to thi in time observ mont cristo you
know that human invent march from the complex to the simpl and
simplic is alwai perfect
in the meanwhil continu the magistr our code ar in full
forc with all their contradictori enact deriv from gallic
custom roman law and frank usag the knowledg of all which you
will agre is not to be acquir without extend labor it need
tediou studi to acquir thi knowledg and when acquir a strong
power of brain to retain it
i agre with you entir sir but all that even you know with
respect to the french code i know not onli in refer to that code
but as regard the code of all nation the english turkish
japanes hindu law ar as familiar to me as the french law and
thu i wa right when i said to you that rel you know that
everyth is rel sirthat rel to what i have done you
have veri littl to do but that rel to all i have learn you
have yet a great deal to learn
but with what motiv have you learn all thi inquir villefort
in astonish
mont cristo smile
realli sir he observ i see that in spite of the reput
which you have acquir as a superior man you look at everyth from
the materi and vulgar view of societi begin with man and end
with manthat is to sai in the most restrict most narrow view which
it is possibl for human understand to embrac
prai sir explain yourself said villefort more and more
astonish i realli donotunderstand youperfectli
i sai sir that with the ey fix on the social organ of
nation you see onli the spring of the machin and lose sight of the
sublim workman who make them act i sai that you do not recogn
befor you and around you ani but those officehold whose
commiss have been sign by a minist or king and that the men
whom god ha put abov those officehold minist and king by
give them a mission to follow out instead of a post to filli sai
that thei escap your narrow limit field of observ it is thu
that human weak fail from it debilit and imperfect organ
tobia took the angel who restor him to light for an ordinari young
man the nation took attila who wa doom to destroi them for a
conqueror similar to other conqueror and it wa necessari for both to
reveal their mission that thei might be known and acknowledg on
wa compel to sai i am the angel of the lord and the other i
am the hammer of god in order that the divin essenc in both might
be reveal
then said villefort more and more amaz and realli suppos he
wa speak to a mystic or a madman you consid yourself as on of
those extraordinari be whom you have mention
and why not said mont cristo coldli
your pardon sir repli villefort quit astound but you will
excus me if when i present myself to you i wa unawar that i
should meet with a person whose knowledg and understand so far
surpass the usual knowledg and understand of men it is not usual
with us corrupt wretch of civil to find gentlemen like
yourself possessor as you ar of immens fortuneat least so it is
saidand i beg you to observ that i do not inquir i mere
repeatit is not usual i sai for such privileg and wealthi be
to wast their time in specul on the state of societi in
philosoph reveri intend at best to consol those whom fate ha
disinherit from the good of thi world
realli sir retort the count have you attain the emin
situat in which you ar without have admit or even without
have met with except and do you never us your ey which must
have acquir so much finess and certainti to divin at a glanc
the kind of man by whom you ar confront should not a magistr be
not mere the best administr of the law but the most crafti
expound of the chicaneri of hi profess a steel probe to search
heart a touchston to try the gold which in each soul is mingl with
more or less of alloi
sir said villefort upon my word you overcom me i realli never
heard a person speak as you do
becaus you remain etern encircl in a round of gener
condit and have never dare to rais your wing into those upper
sphere which god ha peopl with invis or except be
and you allow then sir that sphere exist and that these mark and
invis be mingl amongst us
why should thei not can you see the air you breath and yet without
which you could not for a moment exist
then we do not see those be to whom you allud
ye we do you see them whenev god pleas to allow them to assum
a materi form you touch them come in contact with them speak to
them and thei repli to you
ah said villefort smile i confess i should like to be warn
when on of these be is in contact with me
you have been serv as you desir monsieur for you were warn just
now and i now again warn you
then you yourself ar on of these mark be

call the chanc of fatenam ruin chang circumstancesi have
fulli anticip and if ani of these should overtak me yet it will
not overwhelm me unless i die i shall alwai be what i am and
therefor it is that i utter the thing you have never heard even from
the mouth of kingsfor king have need and other person have fear of
you for who is there who doe not sai to himself in a societi as
incongru organ as our perhap some dai i shall have to do
with the king attornei
but can you not sai that sir the moment you becom an inhabit of
franc you ar natur subject to the french law
i know it sir repli mont cristo but when i visit a countri i
begin to studi by all the mean which ar avail the men from whom
i mai have anyth to hope or to fear till i know them as well as
perhap better than thei know themselv it follow from thi that
the king attornei be he who he mai with whom i should have to deal
would assuredli be more embarrass than i should
that is to sai repli villefort with hesit that human natur
be weak everi man accord to your creed ha commit fault
fault or crime respond mont cristo with a neglig air
and that you alon amongst the men whom you do not recogn as your
brothersfor you have said so observ villefort in a tone that
falter somewhaty alon ar perfect
no not perfect wa the count repli onli impenetr that
all but let us leav off thi strain sir if the tone of it is
displeas to you i am no more disturb by your justic than ar you

emphasi so deep that villefort involuntarili shudder i have my
pride for menserp alwai readi to threaten everyon who would pass
without crush them under foot but i lai asid that pride befor
god who ha taken me from noth to make me what i am

reflect long for a gnaw ambit had long prei upon me and
then i repli listeni have alwai heard of provid and yet i
have never seen him or anyth that resembl him or which can make

that the most beauti noblest most sublim thing in the world is
to recompens and punish satan bow hi head and groan you
mistak he said provid doe exist onli you have never seen

seen noth that resembl him becaus he work by secret spring
and move by hidden wai all i can do for you is to make you on of
the agent of that provid the bargain wa conclud i mai
sacrific my soul but what matter it ad mont cristo if the

ag she ha had the happi to find a second mother in madam de
villefort the world howev is mistaken my father abandon me from

protect as he is by hi high posit and firmli establish
reput for talent and unswerv integr no on could oppos
him he is allpow even with the king he would crush you at a
word dear maximilian believ me when i assur you that if i do not
attempt to resist my father command it is more on your account than
my own
but why valentin do you persist in anticip the worstwhi
pictur so gloomi a futur
becaus i judg it from the past
still consid that although i mai not be strictli speak what is
term an illustri match for you i am for mani reason not
altogeth so much beneath your allianc the dai when such

those of the empir the aristocraci of the lanc ha alli itself
with the nobil of the cannon now i belong to thi lastnam class
and certainli my prospect of militari prefer ar most encourag
as well as certain my fortun though small is free and unfett
and the memori of my late father is respect in our countri

citi i sai our countri becaus you were born not far from
marseil
dont speak of marseil i beg of you maximilian that on word
bring back my mother to my recollectionmi angel mother who di too
soon for myself and all who knew her but who after watch over her
child dure the brief period allot to her in thi world now i
fondli hope watch from her home in heaven oh if my mother were

tell her that i love you and she would protect us
i fear valentin repli the lover that were she live i should
never have had the happi of know you you would then have been
too happi to have stoop from your grandeur to bestow a thought on

now it is you who ar unjust maximilian cri valentin but there
is on thing i wish to know
and what is that inquir the young man perceiv that valentin
hesit
tell me truli maximilian whether in former dai when our father
dwelt at marseil there wa ever ani misunderstand between them
not that i am awar of repli the young man unless inde ani
illfeel might have arisen from their be of opposit partiesyour
father wa as you know a zealou partisan of the bourbon while mine
wa wholli devot to the emperor there could not possibl be ani
other differ between them but why do you ask
i will tell you repli the young girl for it is but right you

you had told me all about it the previou even i felt so happi
and yet so nervou at the idea of speak your name aloud and befor
so mani peopl that i realli think i should have pass it over but
for the fear that my do so might creat suspicion as to the caus
of my silenc so i summon up all my courag and read it as firmli

dear valentin
well would you believ it directli my father caught the sound of
your name he turn round quit hastili and like a poor silli thing
i wa so persuad that everyon must be as much affect as myself by
the utter of your name that i wa not surpris to see my father
start and almost trembl but i even thought though that sure must
have been a mistak that m danglar trembl too
morrel morrel cri my father stop a bit then knit hi
brow into a deep frown he ad sure thi cannot be on of the
morrel famili who live at marseil and gave us so much troubl from
their violent bonapartismi mean about the year 1815
ye repli m danglar i believ he is the son of the old
shipown
inde answer maximilian and what did your father sai then
valentin
oh such a dread thing that i dont dare to tell you
alwai tell me everyth said maximilian with a smile
ah continu my father still frown their idol emperor
treat these madmen as thei deserv he call them food for
cannon which wa precis all thei were good for and i am delight
to see that the present govern have adopt thi salutari principl
with all it pristin vigor if algier were good for noth but to
furnish the mean of carri so admir an idea into practic it
would be an acquisit well worthi of struggl to obtain though it
certainli doe cost franc somewhat dear to assert her right in that
uncivil countri
brutal polit i must confess said maximilian but dont attach
ani seriou import dear to what your father said my father wa
not a bit behind your in that sort of talk why said he doe not
the emperor who ha devis so mani clever and effici mode of
improv the art of war organ a regiment of lawyer judg and
legal practition send them in the hottest fire the enemi could
maintain and us them to save better men you see my dear that
for picturesqu express and generos of spirit there is not much
to choos between the languag of either parti but what did m
danglar sai to thi outburst on the part of the procureur
oh he laugh and in that singular manner so peculiar to
himselfhalfmalici halfferoci he almost immedi got up
and took hi leav then for the first time i observ the agit
of my grandfath and i must tell you maximilian that i am the onli
person capabl of discern emot in hi paralyz frame and i
suspect that the convers that had been carri on in hi
presenc for thei alwai sai and do what thei like befor the dear old
man without the smallest regard for hi feel had made a strong
impress on hi mind for natur enough it must have pain him
to hear the emperor he so devotedli love and serv spoken of in that
depreci manner
the name of m noirtier interpos maximilian is celebr
throughout europ he wa a statesman of high stand and you mai or
mai not know valentin that he took a lead part in everi
bonapartist conspiraci set on foot dure the restor of the
bourbon
oh i have often heard whisper of thing that seem to me most
strangeth father a bonapartist the son a royalist what can have
been the reason of so singular a differ in parti and polit
but to resum my stori i turn toward my grandfath as though to
question him as to the caus of hi emot he look express at
the newspap i had been read what is the matter dear
grandfath said i ar you pleas he gave me a sign in the
affirm with what my father said just now he return a sign in

ye true repli madam de villefort somewhat uneasili i
rememb now
i do not recollect now all the variou subject of which we
discours madam continu the count with perfect calm but i
perfectli rememb that fall into the error which other had
entertain respect me you consult me as to the health of
mademoisel de villefort
ye realli sir you were in fact a medic man said madam de
villefort sinc you had cure the sick
molir or beaumarchai would repli to you madam that it wa
precis becaus i wa not that i had cure my patient for myself
i am content to sai to you that i have studi chemistri and the
natur scienc somewhat deepli but still onli as an amateur you
understand
at thi moment the clock struck six
it is six oclock said madam de villefort evid agit
valentin will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have hi
dinner
valentin rose and salut the count left the apart without
speak
oh madam said the count when valentin had left the room wa it
on my account that you sent mademoisel de villefort awai
by no mean repli the young ladi quickli but thi is the hour
when we usual give m noirtier the unwelcom meal that sustain hi
piti exist you ar awar sir of the deplor condit of
my husband father
ye madam m de villefort spoke of it to mea paralysi i think
ala ye the poor old gentleman is entir helpless the mind alon
is still activ in thi human machin and that is faint and
flicker like the light of a lamp about to expir but excus me
sir for talk of our domest misfortun i interrupt you at the
moment when you were tell me that you were a skil chemist
no madam i did not sai as much as that repli the count with a
smile quit the contrari i have studi chemistri becaus have
determin to live in eastern climat i have been desir of
follow the exampl of king mithrid
mithrid rex ponticu said the young scamp as he tore some
beauti portrait out of a splendid album the individu who took
cream in hi cup of poison everi morn at breakfast
edward you naughti boi exclaim madam de villefort snatch the
mutil book from the urchin grasp you ar posit past
bear you realli disturb the convers go leav us and join
your sister valentin in dear grandpapa noirtier room
the album said edward sulkili
what do you meanth album
i want the album
how dare you tear out the draw
oh it amus me
gogo at onc
i wont go unless you give me the album said the boi seat
himself doggedli in an armchair accord to hi habit of never give
wai
take it then and prai disturb us no longer said madam de
villefort give the album to edward who then went toward the door
led by hi mother the count follow her with hi ey
let us see if she shut the door after him he mutter
madam de villefort close the door carefulli after the child the
count appear not to notic her then cast a scrutin glanc
around the chamber the young wife return to her chair in which she
seat herself
allow me to observ madam said the count with that kind tone he
could assum so well you ar realli veri sever with that dear clever
child
oh sometim sever is quit necessari repli madam de
villefort with all a mother real firm
it wa hi corneliu nepo that master edward wa repeat when he
refer to king mithrid continu the count and you
interrupt him in a quotat which prove that hi tutor ha by no
mean neglect him for your son is realli advanc for hi year
the fact is count answer the mother agreeabl flatter he ha
great aptitud and learn all that is set befor him he ha but on
fault he is somewhat wil but realli on refer for the moment
to what he said do you truli believ that mithrid us these
precaut and that these precaut were efficaci
i think so madam becaus i myself have made us of them that i
might not be poison at napl at palermo and at smyrnathat is to
sai on three sever occas when but for these precaut i must
have lost my life
and your precaut were success
complet so
ye i rememb now your mention to me at perugia someth of thi
sort
inde said the count with an air of surpris remark well
counterfeit i realli did not rememb
i inquir of you if poison act equal and with the same effect
on men of the north as on men of the south and you answer me that
the cold and sluggish habit of the north did not present the same
aptitud as the rich and energet tempera of the nativ of the
south
and that is the case observ mont cristo i have seen russian
devour without be visibl inconvenienc veget substanc
which would infal have kill a neapolitan or an arab
and you realli believ the result would be still more sure with us
than in the east and in the midst of our fog and rain a man would
habitu himself more easili than in a warm latitud to thi
progress absorpt of poison
certainli it be at the same time perfectli understood that he
should have been duli fortifi against the poison to which he had not
been accustom
ye i understand that and how would you habitu yourself for
instanc or rather how did you habitu yourself to it
oh veri easili suppos you knew beforehand the poison that would be
made us of against you suppos the poison wa for instanc
brucin
brucin is extract from the fals angostura8 is it not inquir
madam de villefort
precis madam repli mont cristo but i perceiv i have not
much to teach you allow me to compliment you on your knowledg such
learn is veri rare among ladi
oh i am awar of that said madam de villefort but i have a
passion for the occult scienc which speak to the imagin like
poetri and ar reduc to figur like an algebra equat but
go on i beg of you what you sai interest me to the greatest degre
30069m
well repli mont cristo suppos then that thi poison wa
brucin and you were to take a milligramm the first dai two
milligramm the second dai and so on well at the end of ten dai
you would have taken a centigramm at the end of twenti dai
increas anoth milligramm you would have taken three hundr
centigramm that is to sai a dose which you would support without
inconveni and which would be veri danger for ani other person
who had not taken the same precaut as yourself well then at the
end of a month when drink water from the same caraf you would
kill the person who drank with you without your perceiv otherwis
than from slight inconveni that there wa ani poison substanc
mingl with thi water
do you know ani other counterpoison
i do not
i have often read and read again the histori of mithrid said
madam de villefort in a tone of reflect and had alwai consid
it a fabl
no madam contrari to most histori it is true but what you tell
me madam what you inquir of me is not the result of a chanc
queri for two year ago you ask me the same question and said
then that for a veri long time thi histori of mithrid had
occupi your mind
true sir the two favorit studi of my youth were botani and
mineralog and subsequ when i learn that the us of simpl
frequent explain the whole histori of a peopl and the entir life
of individu in the east as flower betoken and symbol a love
affair i have regret that i wa not a man that i might have been a
flamel a fontana or a cabani
and the more madam said mont cristo as the orient do not
confin themselv as did mithrid to make a cuirass of hi
poison but thei also made them a dagger scienc becom in their
hand not onli a defens weapon but still more frequent an
offens on the on serv against all their physic suffer
the other against all their enemi with opium belladonna brucea
snakewood and the cherrylaurel thei put to sleep all who stand in
their wai there is not on of those women egyptian turkish or
greek whom here you call good women who do not know how by mean
of chemistri to stupefi a doctor and in psycholog to amaz a
confessor
realli said madam de villefort whose ey sparkl with strang
fire at thi convers
oh ye inde madam continu mont cristo the secret drama
of the east begin with a love philtr and end with a death potionbegin
with paradis and end withhel there ar as mani elixir of everi
kind as there ar capric and peculiar in the physic and moral
natur of human and i will sai furtherth art of these chemist is
capabl with the utmost precis to accommod and proport the
remedi and the bane to yearn for love or desir for vengeanc
but sir remark the young woman these eastern societi in the
midst of which you have pass a portion of your exist ar as
fantast as the tale that come from their strang land a man can
easili be put out of the wai there then it is inde the bagdad and
bassora of the thousand and on night the sultan and vizier who
rule over societi there and who constitut what in franc we call the
govern ar realli harounalraschid and giaffar who not onli
pardon a poison but even make him a prime minist if hi crime ha
been an ingeni on and who under such circumst have the
whole stori written in letter of gold to divert their hour of
idl and ennui
by no mean madam the fanci exist no longer in the east there
disguis under other name and conceal under other costum ar
polic agent magistr attorneysgener and bailiff thei hang
behead and impal their crimin in the most agreeabl possibl
manner but some of these like clever rogu have contriv to escap
human justic and succe in their fraudul enterpris by cun
stratagem amongst us a simpleton possess by the demon of hate or
cupid who ha an enemi to destroi or some near relat to dispos
of goe straight to the grocer or druggist give a fals name
which lead more easili to hi detect than hi real on and under
the pretext that the rat prevent him from sleep purchas five or
six gramm of arsenicif he is realli a cun fellow he goe to
five or six differ druggist or grocer and therebi becom onli
five or six time more easili tracedthen when he ha acquir hi
specif he administ duli to hi enemi or near kinsman a dose of
arsen which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst and which
without rhyme or reason make hi victim utter groan which alarm the
entir neighborhood then arriv a crowd of policemen and constabl
thei fetch a doctor who open the dead bodi and collect from the
entrail and stomach a quantiti of arsen in a spoon next dai a
hundr newspap relat the fact with the name of the victim and
the murder the same even the grocer or grocer druggist or
druggist come and sai it wa i who sold the arsen to the
gentleman and rather than not recogn the guilti purchas thei
will recogn twenti then the foolish crimin is taken imprison
interrog confront confound condemn and cut off by hemp or
steel or if she be a woman of ani consider thei lock her up for
life thi is the wai in which you northern understand chemistri
madam desru wa howev i must confess more skil
what would you have sir said the ladi laugh we do what we
can all the world ha not the secret of the medici or the borgia
now repli the count shrug hi shoulder shall i tell you
the caus of all these stupid it is becaus at your theatr by
what at least i could judg by read the piec thei plai thei see
person swallow the content of a phial or suck the button of a ring
and fall dead instantli five minut afterward the curtain fall and
the spectat depart thei ar ignor of the consequ of the
murder thei see neither the polic commissari with hi badg of
offic nor the corpor with hi four men and so the poor fool
believ that the whole thing is as easi as ly but go a littl wai
from francego either to aleppo or cairo or onli to napl or rome
and you will see peopl pass by you in the streetspeopl erect
smile and freshcolor of whom asmodeu if you were hold on by
the skirt of hi mantl would sai that man wa poison three week
ago he will be a dead man in a month
then remark madam de villefort thei have again discov the
secret of the famou aqua tofana that thei said wa lost at perugia
ah but madam doe mankind ever lose anyth the art chang about
and make a tour of the world thing take a differ name and the
vulgar do not follow themthat is all but there is alwai the same
result poison act particularli on some organ or anotheron on the
stomach anoth on the brain anoth on the intestin well the
poison bring on a cough the cough an inflamm of the lung or
some other complaint catalogu in the book of scienc which howev
by no mean preclud it from be decidedli mortal and if it were
not would be sure to becom so thank to the remedi appli by
foolish doctor who ar gener bad chemist and which will act in
favor of or against the maladi as you pleas and then there is a
human be kill accord to all the rule of art and skill and of
whom justic learn noth as wa said by a terribl chemist of my
acquaint the worthi abb adelmont of taormina in sicili who ha
studi these nation phenomena veri profoundli
it is quit fright but deepli interest said the young ladi
motionless with attent i thought i must confess that these
tale were invent of the middl ag
ye no doubt but improv upon by our what is the us of time

so ad madam de villefort constantli return to her object
the poison of the borgia the medici the rene the ruggieri
and later probabl that of baron de trenck whose stori ha been so
misus by modern drama and romanc
were object of art madam and noth more repli the count do
you suppos that the real savant address himself stupidli to the
mere individu by no mean scienc love eccentr leap and
bound trial of strength fanci if i mai be allow so to term
them thu for instanc the excel abb adelmont of whom i spoke
just now made in thi wai some marvel experi
realli
ye i will mention on to you he had a remark fine garden full
of veget flower and fruit from amongst these veget he
select the most simplea cabbag for instanc for three dai he
water thi cabbag with a distil of arsen on the third the
cabbag began to droop and turn yellow at that moment he cut it in
the ey of everybodi it seem fit for tabl and preserv it
wholesom appear it wa onli poison to the abb adelmont he
then took the cabbag to the room where he had rabbitsfor the abb
adelmont had a collect of rabbit cat and guineapig fulli as
fine as hi collect of veget flower and fruit well the
abb adelmont took a rabbit and made it eat a leaf of the cabbag
the rabbit di what magistr would find or even ventur to
insinu anyth against thi what procureur ha ever ventur to
draw up an accus against m magendi or m flouren in
consequ of the rabbit cat and guineapig thei have killednot
on so then the rabbit di and justic take no notic thi
rabbit dead the abb adelmont ha it entrail taken out by hi cook
and thrown on the dunghil on thi dunghil is a hen who peck
these intestin is in her turn taken ill and di next dai at the
moment when she is struggl in the convuls of death a vultur is
fly by there ar a good mani vultur in adelmont countri thi
bird dart on the dead fowl and carri it awai to a rock where it
dine off it prei three dai afterward thi poor vultur which ha
been veri much indispos sinc that dinner suddenli feel veri giddi
while fly aloft in the cloud and fall heavili into a fishpond
the pike eel and carp eat greedili alwai as everybodi knowswel
thei feast on the vultur now suppos that next dai on of these
eel or pike or carp poison at the fourth remov is serv up at
your tabl well then your guest will be poison at the fifth
remov and die at the end of eight or ten dai of pain in the
intestin sick or abscess of the pyloru the doctor open the
bodi and sai with an air of profound learn the subject ha di of
a tumor on the liver or of typhoid fever
but remark madam de villefort all these circumst which you
link thu to on anoth mai be broken by the least accid the
vultur mai not see the fowl or mai fall a hundr yard from the
fishpond
ah that is where the art come in to be a great chemist in the east
on must direct chanc and thi is to be achiev
madam de villefort wa in deep thought yet listen attent
but she exclaim suddenli arsen is indel indestruct
in whatsoev wai it is absorb it will be found again in the bodi of
the victim from the moment when it ha been taken in suffici
quantiti to caus death
precis so cri mont cristoprecis so and thi is what i
said to my worthi adelmont he reflect smile and repli to me by
a sicilian proverb which i believ is also a french proverb my son
the world wa not made in a daybut in seven return on sundai on the
sundai follow i did return to him instead of have water hi
cabbag with arsen he had water it thi time with a solut of
salt have their basi in strychnin strychno colubrina as the
learn term it now the cabbag had not the slightest appear of
diseas in the world and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust
yet five minut afterward the rabbit wa dead the fowl peck at
the rabbit and the next dai wa a dead hen thi time we were the
vultur so we open the bird and thi time all special symptom had
disappear there were onli gener symptom there wa no peculiar
indic in ani organan excit of the nervou systemthat wa
it a case of cerebr congestionnoth more the fowl had not been
poisonedsh had di of apoplexi apoplexi is a rare diseas among
fowl i believ but veri common among men
madam de villefort appear more and more thought
it is veri fortun she observ that such substanc could onli
be prepar by chemist otherwis all the world would be poison
each other
by chemist and person who have a tast for chemistri said mont
cristo carelessli
and then said madam de villefort endeavor by a struggl and
with effort to get awai from her thought howev skilfulli it is
prepar crime is alwai crime and if it avoid human scrutini it
doe not escap the ey of god the orient ar stronger than we ar
in case of conscienc and veri prudent have no hellthat is the
point
30075m
realli madam thi is a scrupl which natur must occur to a pure
mind like your but which would easili yield befor sound reason
the bad side of human thought will alwai be defin by the paradox of
jean jacqu rousseauy rememberth mandarin who is kill five
hundr leagu off by rais the tip of the finger man whole life
pass in do these thing and hi intellect is exhaust by
reflect on them you will find veri few person who will go and
brutal thrust a knife in the heart of a fellowcreatur or will
administ to him in order to remov him from the surfac of the globe
on which we move with life and anim that quantiti of arsen of
which we just now talk such a thing is realli out of ruleeccentr
or stupid to attain such a point the blood must be heat to
thirtysix degre the puls be at least at nineti and the feel
excit beyond the ordinari limit but suppos on pass as is
permiss in philolog from the word itself to it soften synonym
then instead of commit an ignobl assassin you make an
elimin you mere and simpli remov from your path the
individu who is in your wai and that without shock or violenc
without the displai of the suffer which in the case of becom a
punish make a martyr of the victim and a butcher in everi sens
of the word of him who inflict them then there will be no blood no
groan no convuls and abov all no conscious of that horrid
and compromis moment of accomplish the actthen on escap the
clutch of the human law which sai do not disturb societi thi is
the mode in which thei manag these thing and succe in eastern
clime where there ar grave and phlegmat person who care veri
littl for the question of time in conjunctur of import
yet conscienc remain remark madam de villefort in an agit
voic and with a stifl sigh
ye answer mont cristo happili ye conscienc doe remain and
if it did not how wretch we should be after everi action requir
exert it is conscienc that save us for it suppli us with a
thousand good excus of which we alon ar judg and these reason
howsoev excel in produc sleep would avail us but veri littl
befor a tribun when we were tri for our live thu richard iii
for instanc wa marvel serv by hi conscienc after the
put awai of the two children of edward iv in fact he could sai
these two children of a cruel and persecut king who have inherit
the vice of their father which i alon could perceiv in their
juvenil propensitiesthes two children ar impedi in my wai of
promot the happi of the english peopl whose unhappi thei
the children would infal have caus thu wa ladi macbeth

husband whatev shakespear mai sai a throne ah matern love is
a great virtu a power motiveso power that it excus a
multitud of thing even if after duncan death ladi macbeth had
been at all prick by her conscienc
madam de villefort listen with avid to these appal maxim and
horribl paradox deliv by the count with that iron
simplic which wa peculiar to him
after a moment silenc the ladi inquir
do you know my dear count she said that you ar a veri terribl
reason and that you look at the world through a somewhat distemp
medium have you realli measur the world by scrutini or through
alemb and crucibl for you must inde be a great chemist and the
elixir you administ to my son which recal him to life almost
instantan
30077m
oh do not place ani relianc on that madam on drop of that
elixir suffic to recal life to a dy child but three drop would
have impel the blood into hi lung in such a wai as to have
produc most violent palpit six would have suspend hi
respir and caus syncop more seriou than that in which he wa
ten would have destroi him you know madam how suddenli i snatch
him from those phial which he so imprud touch
is it then so terribl a poison
oh no in the first place let us agre that the word poison doe not
exist becaus in medicin us is made of the most violent poison
which becom accord as thei ar emploi most salutari remedi
what then is it
a skil prepar of my friend the worthi abb adelmont who
taught me the us of it
oh observ madam de villefort it must be an admir
antispasmod
perfect madam as you have seen repli the count and i
frequent make us of itwith all possibl prudenc though be it
observ he ad with a smile of intellig
most assuredli respond madam de villefort in the same tone as
for me so nervou and so subject to faint fit i should requir a
doctor adelmont to invent for me some mean of breath freeli and
tranquil my mind in the fear i have of dy some fine dai of
suffoc in the meanwhil as the thing is difficult to find in
franc and your abb is not probabl dispos to make a journei to
pari on my account i must continu to us monsieur planch
antispasmod and mint and hoffman drop ar among my favorit
remedi here ar some lozeng which i have made up on purpos thei
ar compound doubli strong
mont cristo open the tortoiseshel box which the ladi present to
him and inhal the odor of the lozeng with the air of an amateur
who thoroughli appreci their composit
thei ar inde exquisit he said but as thei ar necessarili
submit to the process of deglutitiona function which it is
frequent imposs for a faint person to accomplishi prefer my
own specif
undoubtedli and so should i prefer it after the effect i have seen
produc but of cours it is a secret and i am not so indiscreet as
to ask it of you
but i said mont cristo rise as he spokei am gallant enough to
offer it you
30079m
how kind you ar
onli rememb on thinga small dose is a remedi a larg on is
poison on drop will restor life as you have seen five or six will
inevit kill and in a wai the more terribl inasmuch as pour
into a glass of wine it would not in the slightest degre affect it
flavor but i sai no more madam it is realli as if i were
prescrib for you
the clock struck halfpast six and a ladi wa announc a friend of
madam de villefort who came to dine with her
if i had had the honor of see you for the third or fourth time
count instead of onli for the second said madam de villefort if i
had had the honor of be your friend instead of onli have the
happi of be under an oblig to you i should insist on
detain you to dinner and not allow myself to be daunt by a first
refus
a thousand thank madam repli mont cristo but i have an
engag which i cannot break i have promis to escort to the
acadmi a greek princess of my acquaint who ha never seen your
grand opera and who reli on me to conduct her thither
adieu then sir and do not forget the prescript
ah in truth madam to do that i must forget the hour convers
i have had with you which is inde imposs
mont cristo bow and left the hous madam de villefort remain
immers in thought
he is a veri strang man she said and in my opinion is himself the
adelmont he talk about
as to mont cristo the result had surpass hi utmost expect
good said he as he went awai thi is a fruit soil and i feel
certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground
next morn faith to hi promis he sent the prescript
request
chapter 53 robert le diabl
the pretext of an opera engag wa so much the more feasibl as
there chanc to be on that veri night a more than ordinari attract
at the acadmi royal levasseur who had been suffer under sever
ill made hi reappear in the charact of bertram and as
usual the announc of the most admir product of the favorit
compos of the dai had attract a brilliant and fashion audienc
morcerf like most other young men of rank and fortun had hi
orchestra stall with the certainti of alwai find a seat in at
least a dozen of the princip box occupi by person of hi
acquaint he had moreov hi right of entri into the omnibu
box chteaurenaud rent a stall besid hi own while beauchamp as
a journalist had unlimit rang all over the theatr it happen
that on thi particular night the minist box wa place at the
dispos of lucien debrai who offer it to the comt de morcerf who
again upon hi reject of it by mercd sent it to danglar with
an intim that he should probabl do himself the honor of join
the baro and her daughter dure the even in the event of their
accept the box in question the ladi receiv the offer with too
much pleasur to dream of a refus to no class of person is the
present of a gratuit operabox more accept than to the
wealthi millionair who still hug economi while boast of carri
a king ransom in hi waistcoat pocket
danglar had howev protest against show himself in a
ministeri box declar that hi polit principl and hi
parliamentari posit as member of the opposit parti would not
permit him so to commit himself the baro had therefor
despatch a note to lucien debrai bid him call for them it be
wholli imposs for her to go alon with eugni to the opera
there is no gainsai the fact that a veri unfavor construct
would have been put upon the circumst if the two women had gone
without escort while the addit of a third in the person of her
mother admit lover enabl mademoisel danglar to defi malic
and illnatur on must take the world as on find it
30083m
the curtain rose as usual to an almost empti hous it be on of
the absurd of parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until
after the begin of the perform so that the first act is
gener plai without the slightest attent be paid to it that
part of the audienc alreadi assembl be too much occupi in
observ the fresh arriv while noth is heard but the nois of
open and shut door and the buzz of convers
sure said albert as the door of a box on the first circl open
that must be the countess g
and who is the countess g inquir chteaurenaud
what a question now do you know baron i have a great mind to pick
a quarrel with you for ask it as if all the world did not know who
the countess g wa
ah to be sure repli chteaurenaud the love venetian is it
not
herself at thi moment the countess perceiv albert and return
hi salut with a smile
you know her it seem said chteaurenaud
franz introduc me to her at rome repli albert
well then will you do as much for me in pari as franz did for you
in rome
with pleasur
there wa a cry of shut up from the audienc thi manifest on
the part of the spectat of their wish to be allow to hear the
music produc not the slightest effect on the two young men who
continu their convers
the countess wa present at the race in the champdemar said
chteaurenaud
todai
ye
bless me i quit forgot the race did you bet
oh mere a paltri fifti loui
and who wa the winner
nautilu i stake on him
but there were three race were there not
ye there wa the prize given by the jockei cluba gold cup you
knowand a veri singular circumst occur about that race
what wa it
oh shut up again interpos some of the audienc
why it wa won by a hors and rider utterli unknown on the cours
is that possibl
true as dai the fact wa nobodi had observ a hors enter by the
name of vampa or that of a jockei style job when at the last
moment a splendid roan mount by a jockei about as big as your fist
present themselv at the startingpost thei were oblig to stuff
at least twenti pound weight of shot in the small rider pocket to
make him weight but with all that he outstrip ariel and barbar
against whom he ran by at least three whole length
and wa it not found out at last to whom the hors and jockei
belong
no
you sai that the hors wa enter under the name of vampa
exactli that wa the titl
then answer albert i am better inform than you ar and know
who the owner of that hors wa
shut up there cri the pit in choru and thi time the tone and
manner in which the command wa given betoken such grow hostil
that the two young men perceiv for the first time that the mandat
wa address to them leisur turn round thei calmli scrutin
the variou counten around them as though demand some on
person who would take upon himself the respons of what thei
deem excess impertin but as no on respond to the
challeng the friend turn again to the front of the theatr and
affect to busi themselv with the stage at thi moment the door of
the minist box open and madam danglar accompani by her
daughter enter escort by lucien debrai who assidu conduct
them to their seat
ha ha said chteaurenaud here come some friend of your
viscount what ar you look at there dont you see thei ar try
to catch your ey
albert turn round just in time to receiv a graciou wave of the fan
from the baro as for mademoisel eugni she scarc vouchsaf
to wast the glanc of her larg black ey even upon the busi of
the stage
i tell you what my dear fellow said chteaurenaud i cannot
imagin what object you can possibl have to mademoisel
danglarsthat is set asid her want of ancestri and somewhat
inferior rank which by the wai i dont think you care veri much about
now bar all that i mean to sai she is a deuc fine girl
handsom certainli repli albert but not to my tast which i
confess inclin to someth softer gentler and more feminin
ah well exclaim chteaurenaud who becaus he had seen hi
thirtieth summer fanci himself duli warrant in assum a sort of
patern air with hi more youth friend you young peopl ar never
satisfi why what would you have more your parent have chosen you
a bride built on the model of diana the huntress and yet you ar not
content
no for that veri resembl affright me i should have like
someth more in the manner of the venu of milo or capua but thi
chaselov diana continu surround by her nymph give me a
sort of alarm lest she should some dai bring on me the fate of acton
and inde it requir but on glanc at mademoisel danglar to
comprehend the just of morcerf remark she wa beauti but her
beauti wa of too mark and decid a charact to pleas a fastidi
tast her hair wa raven black but it natur wave seem somewhat
rebelli her ey of the same color as her hair were surmount by
wellarch brow whose great defect howev consist in an almost
habitu frown while her whole physiognomi wore that express of
firm and decis so littl in accord with the gentler
attribut of her sexher nose wa precis what a sculptor would have
chosen for a chisel juno her mouth which might have been found
fault with as too larg displai teeth of pearli white render
still more conspicu by the brilliant carmin of her lip
contrast vividli with her natur pale complexion but that which
complet the almost masculin look morcerf found so littl to hi
tast wa a dark mole of much larger dimens than these freak of
natur gener ar place just at the corner of her mouth and the
effect tend to increas the express of selfdepend that
character her counten
the rest of mademoisel eugni person wa in perfect keep with
the head just describ she inde remind on of diana as
chteaurenaud observ but her bear wa more haughti and resolut
as regard her attain the onli fault to be found with them wa
the same that a fastidi connoisseur might have found with her
beauti that thei were somewhat too erudit and masculin for so young
a person she wa a perfect linguist a firstrat artist wrote
poetri and compos music to the studi of the latter she profess to
be entir devot follow it with an indefatig persever
assist by a schoolfellowa young woman without fortun whose talent
promis to develop into remark power as a singer it wa rumor
that she wa an object of almost patern interest to on of the
princip compos of the dai who excit her to spare no pain in
the cultiv of her voic which might hereaft prove a sourc of
wealth and independ but thi counsel effectu decid
mademoisel danglar never to commit herself by be seen in public
with on destin for a theatric life and act upon thi
principl the banker daughter though perfectli will to allow
mademoisel louis darmilli that wa the name of the young virtuosa
to practic with her through the dai took especi care not to be seen
in her compani still though not actual receiv at the htel
danglar in the light of an acknowledg friend louis wa treat
with far more kind and consider than is usual bestow on a
gover
the curtain fell almost immedi after the entranc of madam
danglar into her box the band quit the orchestra for the
accustom halfhour interv allow between the act and the
audienc were left at liberti to promenad the salon or lobbi or to
pai and receiv visit in their respect box
morcerf and chteaurenaud were amongst the first to avail themselv
of thi permiss for an instant the idea struck madam danglar that
thi eager on the part of the young viscount aros from hi
impati to join her parti and she whisper her expect to her
daughter that albert wa hurri to pai hi respect to them
mademoisel eugni howev mere return a dissent movement of
the head while with a cold smile she direct the attent of her
mother to an opposit box on the first circl in which sat the
countess g and where morcerf had just made hi appear
30087m
so we meet again my travel friend do we cri the countess
extend her hand to him with all the warmth and cordial of an old
acquaint it wa realli veri good of you to recogn me so
quickli and still more so to bestow your first visit on me

probabl tell me who won the jockei club stake
i am sorri to sai i cannot repli the baron and i wa just ask
the same question of albert

excess onli imaginebut do tell me viscount whether you realli
ar acquaint with it or no
i beg your pardon madam but you were about to relat some stori
were you not you said onli imagineand then paus prai
continu

roan hors with hi eleg littl rider so tastefulli dress in a
pink satin jacket and cap that i could not help prai for their
success with as much earnest as though the half of my fortun were
at stake and when i saw them outstrip all the other and come to the
winningpost in such gallant style i actual clap my hand with
joi imagin my surpris when upon return home the first object i
met on the staircas wa the ident jockei in the pink jacket i
conclud that by some singular chanc the owner of the win hors
must live in the same hotel as myself but as i enter my apart
i beheld the veri gold cup award as a prize to the unknown hors and
rider insid the cup wa a small piec of paper on which were written
these wordsfrom lord ruthven to countess g
precis i wa sure of it said morcerf
sure of what
that the owner of the hors wa lord ruthven himself
what lord ruthven do you mean
why our lord ruthventh vampir of the sall argentina
is it possibl exclaim the countess is he here in pari
to be surewhi not
and you visit himmeet him at your own hous and elsewher
i assur you he is my most intim friend and m de chteaurenaud

but why ar you so sure of hi be the winner of the jockei club
prize
wa not the win hors enter by the name of vampa
what of that
why do you not recollect the name of the celebr bandit by whom i
wa made prison
oh ye
and from whose hand the count extric me in so wonder a
manner
to be sure i rememb it all now
he call himself vampa you see it evid where the count got the
name
but what could have been hi motiv for send the cup to me
in the first place becaus i had spoken much of you to him as you
mai believ and in the second becaus he delight to see a
countrywoman take so live an interest in hi success
i trust and hope you never repeat to the count all the foolish
remark we us to make about him
i should not like to affirm upon oath that i have not besid hi
present you the cup under the name of lord ruthven
oh but that is dread why the man must ow me a fear grudg
doe hi action appear like that of an enemi
no certainli not

and what effect doe he produc
why said albert he wa talk about for a week then the
coron of the queen of england took place follow by the theft of
mademoisel marss diamond and so peopl talk of someth els
my good fellow said chteaurenaud the count is your friend and

32000 franc to madam danglar hi second the almost miracul
preserv of madam de villefort life now it seem that he ha
carri off the prize award by the jockei club i therefor maintain
in spite of morcerf that not onli is the count the object of interest
at thi present moment but also that he will continu to be so for a
month longer if he pleas to exhibit an eccentr of conduct which
after all mai be hi ordinari mode of exist
perhap you ar right said morcerf meanwhil who is in the

ne hermin de servieux
albert wa accompani by lucien debrai who join in hi friend
convers ad some pass compliment the sourc of which the
count talent for finess easili enabl him to guess he wa
convinc that lucien visit wa due to a doubl feel of curios
the larger half of which sentiment eman from the rue de la chauss
dantin in short madam danglar not be abl person to
examin in detail the domest economi and household arrang of a
man who gave awai hors worth 30000 franc and who went to the opera
with a greek slave wear diamond to the amount of a million of
monei had deput those ey by which she wa accustom to see to
give her a faith account of the mode of life of thi
incomprehens person but the count did not appear to suspect that
there could be the slightest connect between lucien visit and the
curios of the baro
you ar in constant commun with the baron danglar the count
inquir of albert de morcerf
ye count you know what i told you
all remain the same then in that quarter
it is more than ever a settl thing said lucienand consid
that thi remark wa all that he wa at that time call upon to make
he adjust the glass to hi ey and bite the top of hi gold head
cane began to make the tour of the apart examin the arm and
the pictur
ah said mont cristo i did not expect that the affair would be so
promptli conclud
oh thing take their cours without our assist while we ar
forget them thei ar fall into their appoint order and when
again our attent is direct to them we ar surpris at the
progress thei have made toward the propos end my father and m
danglar serv togeth in spain my father in the armi and m
danglar in the commissariat depart it wa there that my father
ruin by the revolut and m danglar who never had possess ani
patrimoni both laid the foundat of their differ fortun

which i paid him and continu he cast a sidegl at lucien
who wa turn over the leav of an album mademoisel eugni is
prettyi think i rememb that to be her name

style of beauti which i do not appreci i am an ungrat fellow
you speak as if you were alreadi her husband
ah return albert in hi turn look around to see what lucien
wa do
realli said mont cristo lower hi voic you do not appear to
me to be veri enthusiast on the subject of thi marriag
mademoisel danglar is too rich for me repli morcerf and that
frighten me
bah exclaim mont cristo that a fine reason to give ar you
not rich yourself
my father incom is about 50000 franc per annum and he will give
me perhap ten or twelv thousand when i marri
that perhap might not be consid a larg sum in pari
especi said the count but everyth doe not depend on wealth
and it is a fine thing to have a good name and to occupi a high
station in societi your name is celebr your posit magnific
and then the comt de morcerf is a soldier and it is pleas to see
the integr of a bayard unit to the poverti of a duguesclin
disinterested is the brightest rai in which a nobl sword can
shine as for me i consid the union with mademoisel danglar a
most suitabl on she will enrich you and you will ennobl her
albert shook hi head and look thought
there is still someth els said he
i confess observ mont cristo that i have some difficulti in
comprehend your object to a young ladi who is both rich and
beauti
oh said morcerf thi repugn if repugn it mai be call

whenc can it aris then for you told me your father desir the
marriag
it is my mother who dissent she ha a clear and penetr
judgment and doe not smile on the propos union i cannot account
for it but she seem to entertain some prejudic against the
danglar
30107m
ah said the count in a somewhat forc tone that mai be easili
explain the comtess de morcerf who is aristocraci and refin
itself doe not relish the idea of be alli by your marriag with
on of ignobl birth that is natur enough
i do not know if that is her reason said albert but on thing i do
know that if thi marriag be consumm it will render her quit
miser there wa to have been a meet six week ago in order to
talk over and settl the affair but i had such a sudden attack of

grief

be done you will give me your advic will you not and if possibl
extric me from my unpleas posit i think rather than give
pain to my dear mother i would run the risk of offend the count
mont cristo turn awai he seem move by thi last remark
ah said he to debrai who had thrown himself into an easychair at
the farthest extrem of the salon and who held a pencil in hi right
hand and an account book in hi left what ar you do there ar

oh no wa the tranquil respons i am too fond of art to attempt
anyth of that sort i am do a littl sum in arithmet

youi am calcul what the hous of danglar must have gain by the
last rise in haiti bond from 206 thei have risen to 409 in three
dai and the prudent banker had purchas at 206 therefor he must
have made 300000 livr
that is not hi biggest scoop said morcerf did he not make a

in that case your son would be veri unpleasantli situat
it would be fatal to hi interest
it might caus him to fail in some desir matrimoni allianc
o peccato
you must know that in franc thei ar veri particular on these point
it is not suffici as in itali to go to the priest and sai we
love each other and want you to marri us marriag is a civil affair
in franc and in order to marri in an orthodox manner you must have

all quit correct
take these document then thei do not concern me you will give them
to your son who will of cours take great care of them
i should think so inde if he were to lose them
well and if he were to lose them said mont cristo
in that case repli the major it would be necessari to write to
the cur for duplic and it would be some time befor thei could be
obtain
it would be a difficult matter to arrang said mont cristo
almost an imposs repli the major
i am veri glad to see that you understand the valu of these paper
i regard them as invalu
now said mont cristo as to the mother of the young man
as to the mother of the young man repeat the italian with

fifteen year stori of gypsi who steal children ar not at all
in vogu in thi part of the world and would not be believ you sent
him for hi educ to a colleg in on of the provinc and now you
wish him to complet hi educ in the parisian world that is the
reason which ha induc you to leav via reggio where you have live
sinc the death of your wife that will be suffici
you think so
certainli

if thei should hear of the separ
ah ye what could i sai
that an unfaith tutor bought over by the enemi of your famili
by the corsinari
precis had stolen awai thi child in order that your name might
becom extinct
that is reason sinc he is an onli son
well now that all is arrang do not let these newli awaken
remembr be forgotten you have doubtless alreadi guess that i
wa prepar a surpris for you

recogn me i must be somewhat alter sinc he last saw me
oh the voic of natur said mont cristo
true interrupt the young man i had not look upon it in that
light
now repli mont cristo there is onli on sourc of uneasi
left in your father mind which is thish is anxiou to know how you
have been emploi dure your long absenc from him how you have been
treat by your persecutor and if thei have conduct themselv
toward you with all the defer due to your rank final he is
anxiou to see if you have been fortun enough to escap the bad
moral influenc to which you have been expos and which is infinit
more to be dread than ani physic suffer he wish to discov
if the fine abil with which natur had endow you have been
weaken by want of cultur and in short whether you consid
yourself capabl of resum and retain in the world the high
posit to which your rank entitl you
sir exclaim the young man quit astound i hope no fals
report
as for myself i first heard you spoken of by my friend wilmor the
philanthropist i believ he found you in some unpleas posit but
do not know of what natur for i did not ask not be inquisit
your misfortun engag hi sympathi so you see you must have been
interest he told me that he wa anxiou to restor you to the
posit which you had lost and that he would seek your father until
he found him he did seek and ha found him appar sinc he is
here now and final my friend appris me of your come and gave
me a few other instruct rel to your futur fortun i am quit
awar that my friend wilmor is peculiar but he is sincer and as
rich as a gold mine consequ he mai indulg hi eccentr
without ani fear of their ruin him and i have promis to adher to
hi instruct now sir prai do not be offend at the question i
am about to put to you as it come in the wai of my duti as your
patron i would wish to know if the misfortun which have happen to
youmisfortun entir beyond your control and which in no degre
diminish my regard for youi would wish to know if thei have not in
some measur contribut to render you a stranger to the world in
which your fortun and your name entitl you to make a conspicu
figur
sir return the young man with a reassur of manner make your
mind easi on thi score those who took me from my father and who
alwai intend sooner or later to sell me again to my origin
proprietor as thei have now done calcul that in order to make
the most of their bargain it would be polit to leav me in
possess of all my person and hereditari worth and even to
increas the valu if possibl i have therefor receiv a veri
good educ and have been treat by these kidnapp veri much as
the slave were treat in asia minor whose master made them
grammarian doctor and philosoph in order that thei might fetch
a higher price in the roman market
mont cristo smile with satisfact it appear as if he had not
expect so much from m andrea cavalcanti
besid continu the young man if there did appear some defect in
educ or offenc against the establish form of etiquett i
suppos it would be excus in consider of the misfortun which
accompani my birth and follow me through my youth
well said mont cristo in an indiffer tone you will do as you
pleas count for you ar the master of your own action and ar the
person most concern in the matter but if i were you i would not
divulg a word of these adventur your histori is quit a romanc
and the world which delight in romanc in yellow cover strang
mistrust those which ar bound in live parchment even though thei
be gild like yourself thi is the kind of difficulti which i wish
to repres to you my dear count you would hardli have recit your
touch histori befor it would go forth to the world and be deem
unlik and unnatur you would be no longer a lost child found but
you would be look upon as an upstart who had sprung up like a
mushroom in the night you might excit a littl curios but it is
not everyon who like to be made the centr of observ and the
subject of unpleas remark
i agre with you monsieur said the young man turn pale and in
spite of himself trembl beneath the scrutin look of hi
companion such consequ would be extrem unpleas
nevertheless you must not exagger the evil said mont cristo
for by endeavor to avoid on fault you will fall into anoth you
must resolv upon on simpl and singl line of conduct and for a man
of your intellig thi plan is as easi as it is necessari you must
form honor friendship and by that mean counteract the prejudic
which mai attach to the obscur of your former life
andrea visibl chang counten
i would offer myself as your sureti and friendli advis said mont
cristo did i not possess a moral distrust of my best friend and a
sort of inclin to lead other to doubt them too therefor in
depart from thi rule i should as the actor sai be plai a
part quit out of my line and should therefor run the risk of be
hiss which would be an act of folli
howev your excel said andrea in consider of lord
wilmor by whom i wa recommend to you

he is disfigur by hi uniform but when it becom known that he ha
been for eighteen year in the austrian servic all that will be
pardon we ar not gener veri sever with the austrian in
short you will find your father a veri present person i assur
you

on of the most agreeabl possibl my dear sir he will allow you an
incom of 50000 livr per annum dure the whole time of your stai in

chapter 57 in the lucern patch
our reader must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosur
surround m de villefort hous and behind the gate half
screen from view by the larg chestnuttre which on all side
spread their luxuri branch we shall find some peopl of our
acquaint thi time maximilian wa the first to arriv he wa
intent watch for a shadow to appear among the tree and await
with anxieti the sound of a light step on the gravel walk
at length the longdesir sound wa heard and instead of on figur
as he had expect he perceiv that two were approach him the
delai had been occas by a visit from madam danglar and eugni
which had been prolong beyond the time at which valentin wa
expect that she might not appear to fail in her promis to
maximilian she propos to mademoisel danglar that thei should take
a walk in the garden be anxiou to show that the delai which wa
doubtless a caus of vexat to him wa not occas by ani neglect
on her part the young man with the intuit percept of a lover
quickli understood the circumst in which she wa involuntarili
place and he wa comfort besid although she avoid come
within speak distanc valentin arrang so that maximilian could
see her pass and repass and each time she went by she manag
unperceiv by her companion to cast an express look at the young
man which seem to sai have patienc you see it is not my fault
and maximilian wa patient and emploi himself in mental
contrast the two girlson fair with soft languish ey a
figur gracefulli bend like a weep willow the other a brunett
with a fierc and haughti express and as straight as a poplar it
is unnecessari to state that in the ey of the young man valentin
did not suffer by the contrast in about half an hour the girl went
awai and maximilian understood that mademoisel danglar visit had
at last come to an end in a few minut valentin reenter the
garden alon for fear that anyon should be observ her return she
walk slowli and instead of immedi direct her step toward
the gate she seat herself on a bench and carefulli cast her
ey around to convinc herself that she wa not watch she
present aros and proceed quickli to join maximilian
goodeven valentin said a wellknown voic
goodeven maximilian i know i have kept you wait but you saw
the caus of my delai
ye i recogn mademoisel danglar i wa not awar that you were
so intim with her
who told you we were intim maximilian
no on but you appear to be so from the manner in which you walk
and talk togeth on would have thought you were two schoolgirl
tell your secret to each other
we were have a confidenti convers return valentin she
wa own to me her repugn to the marriag with m de morcerf and
i on the other hand wa confess to her how wretch it made me to
think of marri m dpinai
dear valentin
that will account to you for the unreserv manner which you observ
between me and eugni as in speak of the man whom i could not
love my thought involuntarili revert to him on whom my affect
were fix
ah how good you ar to sai so valentin you possess a qualiti which
can never belong to mademoisel danglar it is that indefin charm
which is to a woman what perfum is to the flower and flavor to the
fruit for the beauti of either is not the onli qualiti we seek
it is your love which make you look upon everyth in that light
no valentin i assur you such is not the case i wa observ you
both when you were walk in the garden and on my honor without at
all wish to depreci the beauti of mademoisel danglar i cannot
understand how ani man can realli love her
the fact is maximilian that i wa there and my presenc had the
effect of render you unjust in your comparison
no but tell meit is a question of simpl curios and which wa
suggest by certain idea pass in my mind rel to mademoisel
danglar
i dare sai it is someth disparag which you ar go to sai it
onli prove how littl indulg we mai expect from your sex
interrupt valentin
you cannot at least deni that you ar veri harsh judg of each
other
if we ar so it is becaus we gener judg under the influenc of
excit but return to your question
30151m
doe mademoisel danglar object to thi marriag with m de morcerf
on account of love anoth
i told you i wa not on term of strict intimaci with eugni
ye but girl tell each other secret without be particularli
intim own now that you did question her on the subject ah i see
you ar smile
if you ar alreadi awar of the convers that pass the wooden
partit which interpos between us and you ha prove but a slight
secur
come what did she sai
she told me that she love no on said valentin that she dislik
the idea of be marri that she would infinit prefer lead an
independ and unfett life and that she almost wish her father
might lose hi fortun that she might becom an artist like her
friend mademoisel louis darmilli
ah you see
well what doe that prove ask valentin
noth repli maximilian
then why did you smile
why you know veri well that you ar reflect on yourself
valentin
do you want me to go awai
ah no no but do not let us lose time you ar the subject on which
i wish to speak
true we must be quick for we have scarc ten minut more to pass
togeth
ma foi said maximilian in constern
ye you ar right i am but a poor friend to you what a life i caus
you to lead poor maximilian you who ar form for happi i
bitterli reproach myself i assur you
well what doe it signifi valentin so long as i am satisfi and
feel that even thi long and pain suspens is ampli repaid by five
minut of your societi or two word from your lip and i have also a
deep convict that heaven would not have creat two heart
harmon as our do and almost miracul brought us togeth to
separ us at last
those ar kind and cheer word you must hope for us both
maximilian that will make me at least partli happi
but why must you leav me so soon
i do not know particular i can onli tell you that madam de
villefort sent to request my presenc as she had a commun to
make on which a part of my fortun depend let them take my fortun
i am alreadi too rich and perhap when thei have taken it thei will
leav me in peac and quiet you would love me as much if i were
poor would you not maximilian
oh i shall alwai love you what should i care for either rich or
poverti if my valentin wa near me and i felt certain that no on
could depriv me of her but do you not fear that thi commun
mai relat to your marriag
i do not think that is the case
howev it mai be valentin you must not be alarm i assur you
that as long as i live i shall never love anyon els
do you think to reassur me when you sai that maximilian
pardon me you ar right i am a brute but i wa go to tell you
that i met m de morcerf the other dai
well
monsieur franz is hi friend you know
what then
monsieur de morcerf ha receiv a letter from franz announc hi
immedi return valentin turn pale and lean her hand against
the gate
ah heaven if it were that but no the commun would not come
through madam de villefort
why not
becausei scarc know whybut it ha appear as if madam de
villefort secretli object to the marriag although she did not
choos openli to oppos it
is it so then i feel as if i could ador madam de villefort
do not be in such a hurri to do that said valentin with a sad
smile
if she object to your marri m dpinai she would be all the more
like to listen to ani other proposit
no maximilian it is not suitor to which madam de villefort
object it is marriag itself
marriag if she dislik that so much why did she ever marri
herself
you do not understand me maximilian about a year ago i talk of
retir to a convent madam de villefort in spite of all the remark
which she consid it her duti to make secretli approv of the
proposit my father consent to it at her instig and it wa
onli on account of my poor grandfath that i final abandon the
project you can form no idea of the express of that old man ey
when he look at me the onli person in the world whom he love and i
had almost said by whom he is belov in return when he learn my
resolut i shall never forget the reproach look which he cast on
me and the tear of utter despair which chase each other down hi
lifeless cheek ah maximilian i experienc at that moment such
remors for my intent that throw myself at hi feet i
exclaimedforg me prai forgiv me my dear grandfath thei mai
do what thei will with me i will never leav you when i had ceas
speak he thankfulli rais hi ey to heaven but without utter
a word ah maximilian i mai have much to suffer but i feel as if my
grandfath look at that moment would more than compens for all
dear valentin you ar a perfect angel and i am sure i do not know
what isabr right and left among the bedouinscan have done to merit
your be reveal to me unless inde heaven took into
consider the fact that the victim of my sword were infidel but
tell me what interest madam de villefort can have in your remain
unmarri
did i not tell you just now that i wa rich maximiliantoo rich i
possess nearli 50000 livr in right of my mother my grandfath and
my grandmoth the marqui and marquis de saintmran will leav me
as much and m noirtier evid intend make me hi heir my
brother edward who inherit noth from hi mother will therefor
be poor in comparison with me now if i had taken the veil all thi
fortun would have descend to my father and in revers to hi
son
ah how strang it seem that such a young and beauti woman should
be so avarici
it is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you
regard as a vice becom almost a virtu when look at in the light of
matern love
but could you not compromis matter and give up a portion of your
fortun to her son
how could i make such a proposit especi to a woman who alwai
profess to be so entir disinterest
valentin i have alwai regard our love in the light of someth
sacr consequ i have cover it with the veil of respect and
hid it in the innermost recess of my soul no human be not even
my sister is awar of it exist valentin will you permit me to
make a confid of a friend and reveal to him the love i bear you
valentin start a friend maximilian and who is thi friend i
trembl to give my permiss
listen valentin have you never experienc for anyon that sudden
and irresist sympathi which made you feel as if the object of it
had been your old and familiar friend though in realiti it wa the
first time you had ever met nai further have you never endeavor to
recal the time place and circumst of your former intercours
and fail in thi attempt have almost believ that your spirit
must have held convers with each other in some state of be anterior
to the present and that you ar onli now occupi in a reminisc of
the past
ye
well that is precis the feel which i experienc when i first
saw that extraordinari man
extraordinari did you sai
ye
you have known him for some time then
scarc longer than eight or ten dai
and do you call a man your friend whom you have onli known for eight
or ten dai ah maximilian i had hope you set a higher valu on the
titl of friend
your logic is most power valentin but sai what you will i can
never renounc the sentiment which ha instinct taken possess
of my mind i feel as if it were ordain that thi man should be
associ with all the good which the futur mai have in store for me
and sometim it realli seem as if hi ey wa abl to see what wa to
come and hi hand endow with the power of direct event accord
to hi own will
he must be a prophet then said valentin smile
inde said maximilian i have often been almost tempt to
attribut to him the gift of propheci at all event he ha a
wonder power of foretel ani futur good
ah said valentin in a mourn tone do let me see thi man
maximilian he mai tell me whether i shall ever be love suffici
to make amend for all i have suffer
my poor girl you know him alreadi
i know him
ye it wa he who save the life of your stepmoth and her son
the count of mont cristo
the same
ah cri valentin he is too much the friend of madam de
villefort ever to be mine
the friend of madam de villefort it cannot be sure valentin
you ar mistaken
no inde i am not for i assur you hi power over our household
is almost unlimit court by my stepmoth who regard him as the
epitom of human wisdom admir by my father who sai he ha never
befor heard such sublim idea so eloqu express idol by
edward who notwithstand hi fear of the count larg black ey
run to meet him the moment he arriv and open hi hand in which he
is sure to find some delight presentm de mont cristo appear to
exert a mysteri and almost uncontrol influenc over all the
member of our famili
if such be the case my dear valentin you must yourself have felt
or at all event will soon feel the effect of hi presenc he meet
albert de morcerf in italyit is to rescu him from the hand of the
banditti he introduc himself to madam danglarsit is that he mai
give her a royal present your stepmoth and her son pass befor hi
doorit is that hi nubian mai save them from destruct thi man
evid possess the power of influenc event both as regard
men and thing i never saw more simpl tast unit to greater
magnific hi smile is so sweet when he address me that i forget
it ever can be bitter to other ah valentin tell me if he ever
look on you with on of those sweet smile if so depend on it you
will be happi
me said the young girl he never even glanc at me on the
contrari if i accident cross hi path he appear rather to avoid
me ah he is not gener neither doe he possess that supernatur
penetr which you attribut to him for if he did he would have
perceiv that i wa unhappi and if he had been gener see me
sad and solitari he would have us hi influenc to my advantag and
sinc as you sai he resembl the sun he would have warm my heart
with on of hi lifegiv rai you sai he love you maximilian how
do you know that he doe all would pai defer to an offic like
you with a fierc moustach and a long sabr but thei think thei mai
crush a poor weep girl with impun
ah valentin i assur you you ar mistaken
if it were otherwiseif he treat me diplomaticallythat is to sai
like a man who wish by some mean or other to obtain a foot in
the hous so that he mai ultim gain the power of dictat to it
occupantsh would if it had been but onc have honor me with the
smile which you extol so loudli but no he saw that i wa unhappi he
understood that i could be of no us to him and therefor paid no
attent to me whatev who know but that in order to pleas madam
de villefort and my father he mai not persecut me by everi mean in
hi power it is not just that he should despis me so without ani
reason ah forgiv me said valentin perceiv the effect which
her word were produc on maximilian i have done wrong for i have
given utter to thought concern that man which i did not even
know exist in my heart i do not deni the influenc of which you
speak or that i have not myself experienc it but with me it ha
been product of evil rather than good
well valentin said morrel with a sigh we will not discuss the
matter further i will not make a confid of him
ala said valentin i see that i have given you pain i can onli
sai how sincer i ask pardon for have griev you but inde i
am not prejud beyond the power of convict tell me what thi
count of mont cristo ha done for you
30157m
i own that your question embarrass me valentin for i cannot sai
that the count ha render me ani ostens servic still as i have
alreadi told you i have an instinct affect for him the sourc
of which i cannot explain to you ha the sun done anyth for me no
he warm me with hi rai and it is by hi light that i see
younoth more ha such and such a perfum done anyth for me no
it odor charm on of my sensesthat is all i can sai when i am ask
why i prais it my friendship for him is as strang and unaccount
as hi for me a secret voic seem to whisper to me that there must be
someth more than chanc in thi unexpect reciproc of
friendship in hi most simpl action as well as in hi most secret
thought i find a relat to my own you will perhap smile at me
when i tell you that ever sinc i have known thi man i have
involuntarili entertain the idea that all the good fortun which ha
befallen me origin from him howev i have manag to live thirti
year without thi protect you will sai but i will endeavor a
littl to illustr my mean he invit me to dine with him on
saturdai which wa a veri natur thing for him to do well what have
i learn sinc that your mother and m de villefort ar both come
to thi dinner i shall meet them there and who know what futur
advantag mai result from the interview thi mai appear to you to be
no unusu combin of circumst nevertheless i perceiv some
hidden plot in the arrangementsometh in fact more than is
appar on a casual view of the subject i believ that thi singular
man who appear to fathom the motiv of everyon ha purpos
arrang for me to meet m and madam de villefort and sometim i
confess i have gone so far as to try to read in hi ey whether he
wa in possess of the secret of our love
my good friend said valentin i should take you for a visionari
and should trembl for your reason if i were alwai to hear you talk
in a strain similar to thi is it possibl that you can see anyth
more than the merest chanc in thi meet prai reflect a littl my
father who never goe out ha sever time been on the point of
refus thi invit madam de villefort on the contrari is
burn with the desir of see thi extraordinari nabob in hi own
hous therefor she ha with great difficulti prevail on my father
to accompani her no no it is as i have said maximilianther is no
on in the world of whom i can ask help but yourself and my
grandfath who is littl better than a corpseno support to cling to
but my mother in heaven
i see that you ar right logic speak said maximilian but
the gentl voic which usual ha such power over me fail to convinc
me todai
i feel the same as regard yourself said valentin and i own that
if you have no stronger proof to give me
i have anoth repli maximilian but i fear you will deem it even
more absurd than the first
so much the wors said valentin smile
it is nevertheless conclus to my mind my ten year of servic
have also confirm my idea on the subject of sudden inspir for
i have sever time ow my life to a mysteri impuls which
direct me to move at onc either to the right or to the left in
order to escap the ball which kill the comrad fight by my side
while it left me unharm
dear maximilian why not attribut your escap to my constant prayer
for your safeti when you ar awai i no longer prai for myself but
for you
30159m
ye sinc you have known me said morrel smile but that cannot
appli to the time previou to our acquaint valentin
you ar veri provok and will not give me credit for anyth but
let me hear thi second proof which you yourself own to be absurd
well look through thi open and you will see the beauti new
hors which i rode here
ah what a beauti creatur cri valentin why did you not
bring him close to the gate so that i could talk to him and pat him
he is as you see a veri valuabl anim said maximilian you know
that my mean ar limit and that i am what would be design a man
of moder pretens well i went to a hors dealer where i saw

chapter 58 m noirtier de villefort
we will now relat what wa pass in the hous of the king attornei
after the departur of madam danglar and her daughter and dure the
time of the convers between maximilian and valentin which we
have just detail
m de villefort enter hi father room follow by madam de
villefort both of the visitor after salut the old man and
speak to barroi a faith servant who had been twentyf year
in hi servic took their place on either side of the paralyt
m noirtier wa sit in an armchair which move upon caster in
which he wa wheel into the room in the morn and in the same wai
drawn out again at night he wa place befor a larg glass which
reflect the whole apart and so without ani attempt to move
which would have been imposs he could see all who enter the room
and everyth which wa go on around him m noirtier although
almost as immov as a corps look at the newcom with a quick
and intellig express perceiv at onc by their ceremoni
courtesi that thei were come on busi of an unexpect and offici
charact
sight and hear were the onli sens remain and thei like two
solitari spark remain to anim the miser bodi which seem
fit for noth but the grave it wa onli howev by mean of on of
these sens that he could reveal the thought and feel that still
occupi hi mind and the look by which he gave express to hi
inner life wa like the distant gleam of a candl which a travel
see by night across some desert place and know that a live be
dwell beyond the silenc and obscur
noirtier hair wa long and white and flow over hi shoulder
while in hi ey shade by thick black lash wa concentr as
it often happen with an organ which is us to the exclus of the
other all the activ address forc and intellig which were
formerli diffus over hi whole bodi and so although the movement of
the arm the sound of the voic and the agil of the bodi were
want the speak ey suffic for all he command with it it
wa the medium through which hi thank were convei in short hi
whole appear produc on the mind the impress of a corps with
live ey and noth could be more startl than to observ the
express of anger or joi suddenli light up these organ while the
rest of the rigid and marblelik featur were utterli depriv of the
power of particip three person onli could understand thi
languag of the poor paralyt these were villefort valentin and
the old servant of whom we have alreadi spoken but as villefort saw
hi father but seldom and then onli when absolut oblig and as he
never took ani pain to pleas or gratifi him when he wa there all
the old man happi wa centr in hi granddaught valentin by
mean of her love her patienc and her devot had learn to read
in noirtier look all the vari feel which were pass in hi
mind to thi dumb languag which wa so unintellig to other she
answer by throw her whole soul into the express of her
counten and in thi manner were the convers sustain
between the bloom girl and the helpless invalid whose bodi could
scarc be call a live on but who nevertheless possess a
fund of knowledg and penetr unit with a will as power as
ever although clog by a bodi render utterli incap of obei
it impuls
valentin had solv the problem and wa abl easili to understand hi
thought and to convei her own in return and through her untir
and devot assidu it wa seldom that in the ordinari transact
of everydai life she fail to anticip the wish of the live
think mind or the want of the almost inanim bodi
as to the servant he had as we have said been with hi master for
fiveandtwenti year therefor he knew all hi habit and it wa
seldom that noirtier found it necessari to ask for anyth so prompt
wa he in administ to all the necess of the invalid
villefort did not need the help of either valentin or the domest in
order to carri on with hi father the strang convers which he wa
about to begin as we have said he perfectli understood the old man
vocabulari and if he did not us it more often it wa onli
indiffer and ennui which prevent him from so do he
therefor allow valentin to go into the garden sent awai barroi
and after have seat himself at hi father right hand while
madam de villefort place herself on the left he address him thu
i trust you will not be displeas sir that valentin ha not come
with us or that i dismiss barroi for our confer will be on
which could not with proprieti be carri on in the presenc of either
madam de villefort and i have a commun to make to you
noirtier face remain perfectli passiv dure thi long preambl
while on the contrari villefort ey wa endeavor to penetr
into the inmost recess of the old man heart

the old man face been mould in wax it could not have shown less
emot at thi new than wa now to be trace there the marriag

madam de villefort now took her part in the convers and ad
we thought thi new would possess an interest for you sir who have

which had formerli exist between m noirtier and the elder dpinai
well understood the agit and anger which the announc had
produc but feign not to perceiv either he immedi resum

that might not be pleasant for the young peopl but that you should
live with them so that you and valentin who ar so attach to each
other would not be separ and you would be abl to pursu exactli
the same cours of life which you have hitherto done and thu instead

two children instead of on to watch over and comfort you

m and madam de villefort found on their return that the count of
mont cristo who had come to visit them in their absenc had been
usher into the drawingroom and wa still await them there
madam de villefort who had not yet suffici recov from her
late emot to allow of her entertain visitor so immedi
retir to her bedroom while the procureur who could better depend
upon himself proceed at onc to the salon
although m de villefort flatter himself that to all outward view
he had complet mask the feel which were pass in hi mind
he did not know that the cloud wa still lower on hi brow so much
so that the count whose smile wa radiant immedi notic hi
sombr and thought air
ma foi said mont cristo after the first compliment were over
what is the matter with you m de villefort have i arriv at the
moment when you were draw up an indict for a capit crime
villefort tri to smile
no count he repli i am the onli victim in thi case it is i
who lose my caus and it is illluck obstinaci and folli which have
caus it to be decid against me
to what do you refer said mont cristo with wellfeign interest
have you realli met with some great misfortun
oh no monsieur said villefort with a bitter smile it is onli a
loss of monei which i have sustainednoth worth mention i assur
you
true said mont cristo the loss of a sum of monei becom almost
immateri with a fortun such as you possess and to on of your
philosoph spirit
it is not so much the loss of the monei that vex me said
villefort though after all 900000 franc ar worth regret but
i am the more annoi with thi fate chanc or whatev you pleas to
call the power which ha destroi my hope and my fortun and mai
blast the prospect of my child also as it is all occas by an old
man relaps into second childhood
30183m
what do you sai said the count 900000 franc it is inde a sum
which might be regret even by a philosoph and who is the caus of
all thi annoy
my father as i told you
m noirtier but i thought you told me he had becom entir
paralyz and that all hi faculti were complet destroi
ye hi bodili faculti for he can neither move nor speak
nevertheless he think act and will in the manner i have describ
i left him about five minut ago and he is now occupi in dictat
hi will to two notari
but to do thi he must have spoken
he ha done better than thath ha made himself understood
how wa such a thing possibl
by the help of hi ey which ar still full of life and as you
perceiv possess the power of inflict mortal injuri
my dear said madam de villefort who had just enter the room
perhap you exagger the evil
goodmorn madam said the count bow
madam de villefort acknowledg the salut with on of her most
graciou smile
what is thi that m de villefort ha been tell me demand mont
cristo and what incomprehens misfortun
incomprehens is the word interrupt the procureur shrug
hi shoulder it is an old man capric
and is there no mean of make him revok hi decis
ye said madam de villefort and it is still entir in the power
of my husband to caus the will which is now in prejudic of
valentin to be alter in her favor
the count who perceiv that m and madam de villefort were begin
to speak in parabl appear to pai no attent to the convers
and feign to be busili engag in watch edward who wa
mischiev pour some ink into the bird waterglass
my dear said villefort in answer to hi wife you know i have
never been accustom to plai the patriarch in my famili nor have i
ever consid that the fate of a univers wa to be decid by my
nod nevertheless it is necessari that my will should be respect in
my famili and that the folli of an old man and the capric of a child
should not be allow to overturn a project which i have entertain
for so mani year the baron dpinai wa my friend as you know and
an allianc with hi son is the most suitabl thing that could possibl
be arrang
do you think said madam de villefort that valentin is in leagu
with him she ha alwai been oppos to thi marriag and i should
not be at all surpris if what we have just seen and heard is noth
but the execut of a plan concert between them
madam said villefort believ me a fortun of 900000 franc is
not so easili renounc
she could nevertheless make up her mind to renounc the world sir
sinc it is onli about a year ago that she herself propos enter a
convent
never mind repli villefort i sai that thi marriag shall be
consumm
notwithstand your father wish to the contrari said madam de
villefort select a new point of attack that is a seriou thing
mont cristo who pretend not to be listen heard howev everi
word that wa said
30185m
madam repli villefort i can truli sai that i have alwai
entertain a high respect for my father becaus to the natur
feel of relationship wa ad the conscious of hi moral
superior the name of father is sacr in two sens he should be
reverenc as the author of our be and as a master whom we ought to
obei but under the present circumst i am justifi in doubt
the wisdom of an old man who becaus he hate the father vent hi
anger on the son it would be ridicul in me to regul my conduct
by such capric i shall still continu to preserv the same respect
toward m noirtier i will suffer without complaint the pecuniari
depriv to which he ha subject me but i shall remain firm in my
determin and the world shall see which parti ha reason on hi
side consequ i shall marri my daughter to the baron franz
dpinai becaus i consid it would be a proper and elig match
for her to make and in short becaus i choos to bestow my
daughter hand on whomev i pleas
what said the count the approb of whose ey villefort had
frequent solicit dure thi speech what do you sai that m
noirtier disinherit mademoisel de villefort becaus she is go to
marri m le baron franz dpinai
ye sir that is the reason said villefort shrug hi
shoulder
the appar reason at least said madam de villefort
the real reason madam i can assur you i know my father
but i want to know in what wai m dpinai can have displeas your
father more than ani other person
i believ i know m franz dpinai said the count is he not the
son of gener de quesnel who wa creat baron dpinai by charl
x
the same said villefort
well but he is a charm young man accord to my idea
he is which make me believ that it is onli an excus of m noirtier
to prevent hi granddaught marri old men ar alwai so selfish in
their affect said madam de villefort
but said mont cristo do you not know ani caus for thi hatr
ah ma foi who is to know
perhap it is some polit differ
my father and the baron dpinai live in the stormi time of which i
onli saw the end said villefort
wa not your father a bonapartist ask mont cristo i think i
rememb that you told me someth of that kind
my father ha been a jacobin more than anyth els said villefort
carri by hi emot beyond the bound of prudenc and the
senat robe which napoleon cast on hi shoulder onli serv to
disguis the old man without in ani degre chang him when my father
conspir it wa not for the emperor it wa against the bourbon for
m noirtier possess thi peculiar he never project ani utopian
scheme which could never be realiz but strove for possibl
and he appli to the realiz of these possibl the terribl
theori of the mountaintheori that never shrank from ani mean
that were deem necessari to bring about the desir result
well said mont cristo it is just as i thought it wa polit
which brought noirtier and m dpinai into person contact although
gener dpinai serv under napoleon did he not still retain
royalist sentiment and wa he not the person who wa assassin on
even on leav a bonapartist meet to which he had been invit
on the supposit that he favor the caus of the emperor
villefort look at the count almost with terror
am i mistaken then said mont cristo
no sir the fact were precis what you have state said madam
de villefort and it wa to prevent the renew of old feud that m
de villefort form the idea of unit in the bond of affect the
two children of these inveter enemi
it wa a sublim and charit thought said mont cristo and the
whole world should applaud it it would be nobl to see mademoisel
noirtier de villefort assum the titl of madam franz dpinai
villefort shudder and look at mont cristo as if he wish to read
in hi counten the real feel which had dictat the word he
had just utter but the count complet baffl the procureur and
prevent him from discov anyth beneath the nevervari smile
he wa so constantli in the habit of assum
although said villefort it will be a seriou thing for valentin
to lose her grandfath fortun i do not think that m dpinai will
be frighten at thi pecuniari loss he will perhap hold me in
greater esteem than the monei itself see that i sacrific
everyth in order to keep my word with him besid he know that
valentin is rich in right of her mother and that she will in all
probabl inherit the fortun of m and madam de saintmran her
mother parent who both love her tenderli
and who ar fulli as well worth love and tend as m noirtier
said madam de villefort besid thei ar to come to pari in about
a month and valentin after the affront she ha receiv need not
consid it necessari to continu to buri herself aliv by be shut
up with m noirtier
the count listen with satisfact to thi tale of wound selflov
and defeat ambit
but it seem to me said mont cristo and i must begin by ask
your pardon for what i am about to sai that if m noirtier disinherit
mademoisel de villefort becaus she is go to marri a man whose
father he detest he cannot have the same caus of complaint against
thi dear edward
true said madam de villefort with an inton of voic which it
is imposs to describ is it not unjustshamefulli unjust poor
edward is as much m noirtier grandchild as valentin and yet if
she had not been go to marri m franz m noirtier would have left
her all hi monei and suppos valentin to be disinherit by her
grandfath she will still be three time richer than he
the count listen and said no more
count said villefort we will not entertain you ani longer with our
famili misfortun it is true that my patrimoni will go to endow
charit institut and my father will have depriv me of my
law inherit without ani reason for do so but i shall have
the satisfact of know that i have act like a man of sens and
feel m dpinai to whom i had promis the interest of thi sum
shall receiv it even if i endur the most cruel privat
howev said madam de villefort return to the on idea which
incessantli occupi her mind perhap it would be better to explain
thi unlucki affair to m dpinai in order to give him the
opportun of himself renounc hi claim to the hand of mademoisel
de villefort
ah that would be a great piti said villefort
a great piti said mont cristo
undoubtedli said villefort moder the tone of hi voic a
marriag onc concert and then broken off throw a sort of discredit
on a young ladi then again the old report which i wa so anxiou to
put an end to will instantli gain ground no it will all go well m
dpinai if he is an honor man will consid himself more than
ever pledg to mademoisel de villefort unless he were actuat by a
decid feel of avaric but that is imposs
i agre with m de villefort said mont cristo fix hi ey on
madam de villefort and if i were suffici intim with him to
allow of give my advic i would persuad him sinc i have been told
m dpinai is come back to settl thi affair at onc beyond all
possibl of revoc i will answer for the success of a project
which will reflect so much honor on m de villefort
the procureur aros delight with the proposit but hi wife
slightli chang color
well that is all that i want and i will be guid by a counsellor
such as you ar said he extend hi hand to mont cristo
therefor let everyon here look upon what ha pass todai as if it
had not happen and as though we had never thought of such a thing as
a chang in our origin plan
sir said the count the world unjust as it is will be pleas
with your resolut your friend will be proud of you and m
dpinai even if he took mademoisel de villefort without ani dowri
which he will not do would be delight with the idea of enter a
famili which could make such sacrific in order to keep a promis and
fulfil a duti
at the conclus of these word the count rose to depart
ar you go to leav us count said madam de villefort
i am sorri to sai i must do so madam i onli came to remind you of
your promis for saturdai

a hillock and in the light of the sun it black arm bend in everi
direct alwai remind me of the claw of an immens beetl and i
assur you it wa never without emot that i gaze on it for i could
not help think how wonder it wa that these variou sign should
be made to cleav the air with such precis as to convei to the
distanc of three hundr leagu the idea and wish of a man sit
at a tabl at on end of the line to anoth man similarli place at
the opposit extrem and all thi effect by a simpl act of
volit on the part of the sender of the messag i began to think of
genii sylph gnome in short of all the minist of the occult
scienc until i laugh aloud at the freak of my own imagin
now it never occur to me to wish for a nearer inspect of these
larg insect with their long black claw for i alwai fear to find
under their stone wing some littl human geniu fag to death with
cabal faction and govern intrigu but on fine dai i learn
that the mover of thi telegraph wa onli a poor wretch hire for
twelv hundr franc a year and emploi all dai not in studi the
heaven like an astronom or in gaze on the water like an angler
or even in enjoi the privileg of observ the countri around him
but all hi monoton life wa pass in watch hi whitebelli
blackclaw fellow insect four or five leagu distant from him at
length i felt a desir to studi thi live chrysali more close and
to endeavor to understand the secret part plai by these insectactor

prepar everi delici fruit that the four quarter of the globe

guest pass in review befor the ey of the astonish parisian
who understood that it wa possibl to expend a thousand loui upon a
dinner for ten person but onli on the condit of eat pearl
like cleopatra or drink refin gold like lorenzo de medici
mont cristo notic the gener astonish and began laugh and
joke about it
gentlemen he said you will admit that when arriv at a certain
degre of fortun the superflu of life ar all that can be
desir and the ladi will allow that after have risen to a
certain emin of posit the ideal alon can be more exalt now
to follow out thi reason what is the marvellousthat which we do
not understand what is it that we realli desirethat which we cannot
obtain now to see thing which i cannot understand to procur
imposs these ar the studi of my life i gratifi my wish by
two meansmi will and my monei i take as much interest in the pursuit
of some whim as you do m danglar in promot a new railwai line
you m de villefort in condemn a culprit to death you m debrai
in pacifi a kingdom you m de chteaurenaud in pleas a woman
and you morrel in break a hors that no on can ride for exampl
you see these two fish on brought from fifti leagu beyond st
petersburg the other five leagu from napl is it not amus to
see them both on the same tabl
what ar the two fish ask danglar
m chteaurenaud who ha live in russia will tell you the name of
on and major cavalcanti who is an italian will tell you the name of
the other
thi on is i think a sterlet said chteaurenaud
and that on if i mistak not a lamprei
just so now m danglar ask these gentlemen where thei ar caught
sterlet said chteaurenaud ar onli found in the volga
and said cavalcanti i know that lake fusaro alon suppli
lamprei of that size
exactli on come from the volga and the other from lake fusaro
imposs cri all the guest simultan
well thi is just what amus me said mont cristo i am like
nerocupitor impossibilium and that is what is amus you at thi
moment thi fish which seem so exquisit to you is veri like no
better than perch or salmon but it seem imposs to procur it
and here it is
but how could you have these fish brought to franc
oh noth more easi each fish wa brought over in a caskon fill
with river herb and weed the other with rush and lake plant thei
were place in a wagon built on purpos and thu the sterlet live
twelv dai the lamprei eight and both were aliv when my cook seiz
them kill on with milk and the other with wine you do not believ
me m danglar
i cannot help doubt answer danglar with hi stupid smile
baptistin said the count have the other fish brought inth
sterlet and the lamprei which came in the other cask and which ar
yet aliv
danglar open hi bewild ey the compani clap their hand
four servant carri in two cask cover with aquat plant and in
each of which wa breath a fish similar to those on the tabl
but why have two of each sort ask danglar
mere becaus on might have di carelessli answer mont cristo
you ar certainli an extraordinari man said danglar and
philosoph mai well sai it is a fine thing to be rich
and to have idea ad madam danglar
oh do not give me credit for thi madam it wa done by the roman
who much esteem them and plini relat that thei sent slave from
ostia to rome who carri on their head fish which he call the
mulu and which from the descript must probabl be the
goldfish it wa also consid a luxuri to have them aliv it be
an amus sight to see them die for when dy thei chang color
three or four time and like the rainbow when it disappear pass
through all the prismat shade after which thei were sent to the
kitchen their agoni form part of their meritif thei were not seen
aliv thei were despis when dead
ye said debrai but then ostia is onli a few leagu from rome
true said mont cristo but what would be the us of live
eighteen hundr year after lucullu if we can do no better than he
could
the two cavalcanti open their enorm ey but had the good sens
not to sai anyth
all thi is veri extraordinari said chteaurenaud still what i
admir the most i confess is the marvel promptitud with which
your order ar execut is it not true that you onli bought thi
hous five or six dai ago
certainli not longer
well i am sure it is quit transform sinc last week if i rememb
rightli it had anoth entranc and the courtyard wa pave and
empti while todai we have a splendid lawn border by tree which
appear to be a hundr year old
why not i am fond of grass and shade said mont cristo
ye said madam de villefort the door wa toward the road befor
and on the dai of my miracul escap you brought me into the hous
from the road i rememb
ye madam said mont cristo but i prefer have an entranc
which would allow me to see the boi de boulogn over my gate
in four dai said morrel it is extraordinari
inde said chteaurenaud it seem quit miracul to make a new
hous out of an old on for it wa veri old and dull too i recollect
come for my mother to look at it when m de saintmran advertis it
for sale two or three year ago
m de saintmran said madam de villefort then thi hous
belong to m de saintmran befor you bought it
it appear so repli mont cristo
is it possibl that you do not know of whom you purchas it
quit so my steward transact all thi busi for me
it is certainli ten year sinc the hous had been occupi said
chteaurenaud and it wa quit melancholi to look at it with the
blind close the door lock and the weed in the court realli if
the hous had not belong to the fatherinlaw of the procureur on
might have thought it some accurs place where a horribl crime had
been commit
villefort who had hitherto not tast the three or four glass of
rare wine which were place befor him here took on and drank it
off mont cristo allow a short time to elaps and then said
it is singular baron but the same idea came across me the first time
i came here it look so gloomi i should never have bought it if my
steward had not taken the matter into hi own hand perhap the fellow
had been bribe by the notari
it is probabl stammer out villefort try to smile but i can
assur you that i had noth to do with ani such proceed thi
hous is part of valentin marriageport and m de saintmran
wish to sell it for if it had remain anoth year or two
uninhabit it would have fallen to ruin
it wa morrel turn to becom pale
there wa abov all on room continu mont cristo veri plain
in appear hung with red damask which i know not why appear to
me quit dramat
why so said danglar why dramat
can we account for instinct said mont cristo ar there not some
place where we seem to breath sadnesswhi we cannot tell it is a
chain of recollectionsan idea which carri you back to other time
to other placeswhich veri like have no connect with the present
time and place and there is someth in thi room which remind me
forcibl of the chamber of the marquis de ganges10 or desdemona stai
sinc we have finish dinner i will show it to you and then we will
take coffe in the garden after dinner the plai
mont cristo look inquiringli at hi guest madam de villefort
rose mont cristo did the same and the rest follow their exampl
villefort and madam danglar remain for a moment as if root to
their seat thei question each other with vagu and stupid glanc
did you hear said madam danglar

to annoi you
you ar deceiv lucien i assur you repli madam danglar and
what i have told you is realli the case ad to the illhumor you
remark but which i did not think it worth while to allud to
it wa evid that madam danglar wa suffer from that nervou
irrit which women frequent cannot account for even to
themselv or that as debrai had guess she had experienc some
secret agit that she would not acknowledg to anyon be a man
who knew that the former of these symptom wa on of the inher
penalti of womanhood he did not then press hi inquiri but wait
for a more appropri opportun when he should again interrog
her or receiv an avow proprio motu
at the door of her apart the baro met mademoisel cornli
her confidenti maid
what is my daughter do ask madam danglar

such late hour and m debrai live some distanc from here
debrai wa petrifi not onli to hear danglar speak so calmli and
polit but becaus it wa appar that beneath outward polit
there realli lurk a determin spirit of opposit to anyth hi
wife might wish to do the baro wa also surpris and show her
astonish by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon
her husband if he had not been intent occupi with the paper where
he wa look to see the close stock quotat the result wa

grant would be given to the compani call the southern i bought two
third of the share of that compani as you had foreseen the share

were paid to you for pinmonei how have you spent thi 250000
francsit is no busi of mine

in the same wai you sai you have noth to do with my cash box be it
so do as you like with your own but do not fill or empti mine
besid how do i know that thi wa not a polit trick that the
minist enrag at see me in the opposit and jealou of the
popular sympathi i excit ha not concert with m debrai to ruin
me
a probabl thing
why not who ever heard of such an occurr as thisa fals
telegraph despatchit is almost imposs for wrong signal to be
made as thei were in the last two telegram it wa done on purpos for
mei am sure of it
sir said the baro humbl ar you not awar that the man
emploi there wa dismiss that thei talk of go to law with
him that order were issu to arrest him and that thi order would
have been put into execut if he had not escap by flight which
prove that he wa either mad or guilti it wa a mistak
ye which made fool laugh which caus the minist to have a
sleepless night which ha caus the minist secretari to blacken
sever sheet of paper but which ha cost me 700000 franc
but sir said hermin suddenli if all thi is as you sai caus
by m debrai why instead of go direct to him do you come and tell
me of it why to accus the man do you address the woman
do i know m debraydo i wish to know himdo i wish to know that he
give advicedo i wish to follow itdo i specul no you do all
thi not i
still it seem to me that as you profit by it
danglar shrug hi shoulder foolish creatur he exclaim
women fanci thei have talent becaus thei have manag two or three
intrigu without be the talk of pari but know that if you had
even hidden your irregular from your husband who ha but the
commenc of the artfor gener husband will not seeyou would
then have been but a faint imit of most of your friend among the
women of the world but it ha not been so with mei see and alwai
have seen dure the last sixteen year you mai perhap have hidden
a thought but not a step not an action not a fault ha escap me
while you flatter yourself upon your address and firmli believ you
had deceiv me what ha been the resultthat thank to my pretend
ignor there is none of your friend from m de villefort to m
debrai who ha not trembl befor me there is not on who ha not
treat me as the master of the houseth onli titl i desir with
respect to you there is not on in fact who would have dare to
speak of me as i have spoken of them thi dai i will allow you to make
me hate but i will prevent your render me ridicul and abov
all i forbid you to ruin me
the baro had been toler compos until the name of villefort
had been pronounc but then she becam pale and rise as if
touch by a spring she stretch out her hand as though conjur an
apparit she then took two or three step toward her husband as
though to tear the secret from him of which he wa ignor or which
he withheld from some odiou calculationodi as all hi
calcul were
m de villefortwhat do you mean
i mean that m de nargonn your first husband be neither a
philosoph nor a banker or perhap be both and see there wa
noth to be got out of a king attornei di of grief or anger at
find after an absenc of nine month that you had been enceint
six i am brutali not onli allow it but boast of it it is on of
the reason of my success in commerci busi why did he kill
himself instead of you becaus he had no cash to save my life belong
to my cash m debrai ha made me lose 700000 franc let him bear hi
share of the loss and we will go on as befor if not let him becom
bankrupt for the 250000 livr and do as all bankrupt dodisappear
he is a charm fellow i allow when hi new is correct but when it
is not there ar fifti other in the world who would do better than
he
madam danglar wa root to the spot she made a violent effort to
repli to thi last attack but she fell upon a chair think of
villefort of the dinner scene of the strang seri of misfortun
which had taken place in her hous dure the last few dai and
chang the usual calm of her establish to a scene of scandal
debat
danglar did not even look at her though she did her best to faint he
shut the bedroom door after him without ad anoth word and
return to hi apart and when madam danglar recov from her
halffaint condit she could almost believ that she had had a
disagre dream
chapter 66 matrimoni project
the dai follow thi scene at the hour debrai usual chose to pai a
visit to madam danglar on hi wai to hi offic hi coup did not
appear at thi time that is about halfpast twelv madam danglar

the ministri reenter hi carriag and told the coachman to drive

mont cristo wa at home onli he wa engag with someon and beg
danglar to wait for a moment in the drawingroom while the banker wa
wait in the anteroom the door open and a man dress as an abb

instead of wait mere bow pass on to the farther apart
and disappear
a minut after the door by which the priest had enter reopen and
mont cristo appear
pardon me said he my dear baron but on of my friend the abb
busoni whom you perhap saw pass by ha just arriv in pari not
have seen him for a long time i could not make up my mind to leav
him sooner so i hope thi will be suffici reason for my have made
you wait
nai said danglar it is my fault i have chosen my visit at a
wrong time and will retir
not at all on the contrari be seat but what is the matter with
you you look careworn realli you alarm me melancholi in a
capitalist like the appear of a comet presag some misfortun to
the world
i have been in illluck for sever dai said danglar and i have
heard noth but bad new
ah inde said mont cristo have you had anoth fall at the
bours
no i am safe for a few dai at least i am onli annoi about a
bankrupt of triest
realli doe it happen to be jacopo manfredi
exactli so imagin a man who ha transact busi with me for i
dont know how long to the amount of 800000 or 900000 franc dure
the year never a mistak or delaya fellow who paid like a princ
well i wa a million in advanc with him and now my fine jacopo
manfredi suspend payment
realli
it is an unheardof fatal i draw upon him for 600000 franc my
bill ar return unpaid and more than that i hold bill of
exchang sign by him to the valu of 400000 franc payabl at hi
correspond in pari at the end of thi month todai is the 30th i
present them but my correspond ha disappear thi with my
spanish affair made a pretti end to the month
then you realli lost by that affair in spain
ye onli 700000 franc out of my cash boxnoth more
why how could you make such a mistakesuch an old stager
oh it is all my wife fault she dream don carlo had return to
spain she believ in dream it is magnet she sai and when she
dream a thing it is sure to happen she assur me on thi convict
i allow her to specul she have her bank and her stockbrok she
specul and lost it is true she specul with her own monei not
mine nevertheless you can understand that when 700000 franc leav
the wife pocket the husband alwai find it out but do you mean to
sai you have not heard of thi why the thing ha made a tremend
nois
ye i heard it spoken of but i did not know the detail and then no
on can be more ignor than i am of the affair in the bours
30251m
then you do not specul
ihow could i specul when i alreadi have so much troubl in
regul my incom i should be oblig besid my steward to keep
a clerk and a boi but touch these spanish affair i think that the
baro did not dream the whole of the don carlo matter the paper
said someth about it did thei not
then you believ the paper
inot the least in the world onli i fanci that the honest
messag wa an except to the rule and that it onli announc
telegraph despatch
well that what puzzl me repli danglar the new of the
return of don carlo wa brought by telegraph
so that said mont cristo you have lost nearli 1700000 franc
thi month
not nearli inde that is exactli my loss
diabl said mont cristo compassion it is a hard blow for a
thirdrat fortun
thirdrat said danglar rather humbl what do you mean by that
certainli continu mont cristo i make three assort in
fortunefirstr secondr and thirdrat fortun i call those
firstrat which ar compos of treasur on possess under on
hand such as mine land and fund properti in such state as
franc austria and england provid these treasur and properti
form a total of about a hundr million i call those secondr
fortun that ar gain by manufactur enterpris jointstock
compani viceroyalti and princip not draw more than
1500000 franc the whole form a capit of about fifti million
final i call those thirdrat fortun which ar compos of a
fluctuat capit depend upon the will of other or upon chanc
which a bankruptci involv or a fals telegram shake such as bank
specul of the dayin fact all oper under the influenc of
greater or less mischanc the whole bring in a real or fictiti
capit of about fifteen million i think thi is about your posit
is it not
confound it ye repli danglar
the result then of six more such month as thi would be to reduc
the thirdrat hous to despair
oh said danglar becom veri pale how you ar run on
let us imagin seven such month continu mont cristo in the same
tone tell me have you ever thought that seven time 1700000 franc
make nearli twelv million no you have notwel you ar right for
if you indulg in such reflect you would never risk your
princip which is to the specul what the skin is to civil
man we have our cloth some more splendid than othersthi is our
credit but when a man di he ha onli hi skin in the same wai on
retir from busi you have noth but your real princip of
about five or six million at the most for thirdrat fortun ar
never more than a fourth of what thei appear to be like the locomot
on a railwai the size of which is magnifi by the smoke and steam
surround it well out of the five or six million which form your
real capit you have just lost nearli two million which must of
cours in the same degre diminish your credit and fictiti fortun
to follow out my simil your skin ha been open by bleed and
thi if repeat three or four time will caus deathso pai attent
to it my dear monsieur danglar do you want monei do you wish me to
lend you some
30253m
what a bad calcul you ar exclaim danglar call to hi
assist all hi philosophi and dissimul i have made monei at
the same time by specul which have succeed i have made up the
loss of blood by nutrit i lost a battl in spain i have been
defeat in triest but my naval armi in india will have taken some
galleon and my mexican pioneer will have discov some mine
veri good veri good but the wound remain and will reopen at the
first loss
no for i am onli embark in certainti repli danglar with the
air of a mountebank sound hi own prais to involv me three
govern must crumbl to dust
well such thing have been
that there should be a famin
recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine
or that the sea should becom dry as in the dai of pharaoh and
even then my vessel would becom caravan
so much the better i congratul you my dear m danglar said
mont cristo i see i wa deceiv and that you belong to the class
of secondr fortun
i think i mai aspir to that honor said danglar with a smile which
remind mont cristo of the sickli moon which bad artist ar so fond
of daub into their pictur of ruin but while we ar speak of
busi danglar ad pleas to find an opportun of chang
the subject tell me what i am to do for m cavalcanti
give him monei if he is recommend to you and the recommend
seem good
excel he present himself thi morn with a bond of 40000
franc payabl at sight on you sign by busoni and return by you
to me with your endorsementof cours i immedi count him over
the forti banknot
mont cristo nod hi head in token of assent
but that is not all continu danglar he ha open an account
with my hous for hi son
mai i ask how much he allow the young man
five thousand franc per month
sixti thousand franc per year i thought i wa right in believ
that cavalcanti to be a stingi fellow how can a young man live upon
5000 franc a month
but you understand that if the young man should want a few thousand
more
do not advanc it the father will never repai it you do not know
these ultramontan millionair thei ar regular miser and by whom
were thei recommend to you
oh by the hous of fenzi on of the best in florenc
i do not mean to sai you will lose but nevertheless mind you hold
to the term of the agreement
would you not trust the cavalcanti
i oh i would advanc ten million on hi signatur i wa onli
speak in refer to the secondr fortun we were mention
just now
and with all thi how unassum he is i should never have taken him
for anyth more than a mere major
and you would have flatter him for certainli as you sai he ha no
manner the first time i saw him he appear to me like an old
lieuten who had grown mouldi under hi epaulet but all the
italian ar the same thei ar like old jew when thei ar not
glitter in orient splendor
the young man is better said danglar
ye a littl nervou perhap but upon the whole he appear
toler i wa uneasi about him
why
becaus you met him at my hous just after hi introduct into the
world as thei told me he ha been travel with a veri sever
tutor and had never been to pari befor
ah i believ noblemen marri amongst themselv do thei not ask
danglar carelessli thei like to unit their fortun
it is usual certainli but cavalcanti is an origin who doe noth
like other peopl i cannot help think that he ha brought hi son
to franc to choos a wife
do you think so
i am sure of it
and you have heard hi fortun mention
noth els wa talk of onli some said he wa worth million and
other that he did not possess a farth
and what is your opinion
i ought not to influenc you becaus it is onli my own person
impress
well and it is that
my opinion is that all these old podest these ancient
condottierifor the cavalcanti have command armi and govern
provincesmi opinion i sai is that thei have buri their million
in corner the secret of which thei have transmit onli to their
eldest son who have done the same from gener to gener and
the proof of thi is seen in their yellow and dry appear like the
florin of the republ which from be constantli gaze upon have
becom reflect in them
certainli said danglar and thi is further support by the fact
of their not possess an inch of land
veri littl at least i know of none which cavalcanti possess
except hi palac in lucca
ah he ha a palac said danglar laugh come that is
someth
ye and more than that he let it to the minist of financ while
he live in a simpl hous oh as i told you befor i think the old
fellow is veri close
come you do not flatter him
i scarc know him i think i have seen him three time in my life
all i know relat to him is through busoni and himself he wa
tell me thi morn that tire of let hi properti lie dormant
in itali which is a dead nation he wish to find a method either in
franc or england of multipli hi million but rememb that
though i place great confid in busoni i am not respons for
thi
never mind accept my thank for the client you have sent me it is a
fine name to inscrib on my ledger and my cashier wa quit proud of
it when i explain to him who the cavalcanti were by the wai thi is
mere a simpl question when thi sort of peopl marri their son do
thei give them ani fortun
oh that depend upon circumst i know an italian princ rich as
a gold mine on of the noblest famili in tuscani who when hi son
marri accord to hi wish gave them million and when thei
marri against hi consent mere allow them thirti crown a month
should andrea marri accord to hi father view he will perhap
give him on two or three million for exampl suppos it were
the daughter of a banker he might take an interest in the hous of the
fatherinlaw of hi son then again if he dislik hi choic the
major take the kei doublelock hi coffer and master andrea would
be oblig to live like the son of a parisian famili by shuffl
card or rattl the dice
ah that boi will find out some bavarian or peruvian princess he will
want a crown an el dorado and poto
no these grand lord on the other side of the alp frequent marri
into plain famili like jupit thei like to cross the race but do
you wish to marri andrea my dear m danglar that you ar ask so
mani question
ma foi said danglar it would not be a bad specul i fanci
and you know i am a specul
you ar not think of mademoisel danglar i hope you would not
like poor andrea to have hi throat cut by albert
albert repeat danglar shrug hi shoulder ah well he
would care veri littl about it i think
but he is betroth to your daughter i believ
well m de morcerf and i have talk about thi marriag but madam
de morcerf and albert
you do not mean to sai that it would not be a good match
inde i imagin that mademoisel danglar is as good as m de
morcerf
mademoisel danglar fortun will be great no doubt especi if
the telegraph should not make ani more mistak
oh i do not mean her fortun onli but tell me
what
why did you not invit m and madam de morcerf to your dinner
i did so but he excus himself on account of madam de morcerf be
oblig to go to diepp for the benefit of sea air
ye ye said danglar laugh it would do her a great deal of
good
why so
becaus it is the air she alwai breath in her youth
mont cristo took no notic of thi illnatur remark
but still if albert be not so rich as mademoisel danglar said
the count you must allow that he ha a fine name
so he ha but i like mine as well
certainli your name is popular and doe honor to the titl thei have
adorn it with but you ar too intellig not to know that accord
to a prejudic too firmli root to be extermin a nobil which
date back five centuri is worth more than on that can onli reckon
twenti year
and for thi veri reason said danglar with a smile which he tri
to make sardon i prefer m andrea cavalcanti to m albert de
morcerf
still i should not think the morcerf would yield to the cavalcanti
the morcerfsstai my dear count said danglar you ar a man of
the world ar you not
i think so
and you understand heraldri
a littl
well look at my coatofarm it is worth more than morcerf
why so
becaus though i am not a baron by birth my real name is at least
danglar
well what then
while hi name is not morcerf
hownot morcerf
not the least in the world
go on
i have been made a baron so that i actual am on he made himself a
count so that he is not on at all
imposs
listen my dear count m de morcerf ha been my friend or rather my
acquaint dure the last thirti year you know i have made the
most of my arm though i never forgot my origin
a proof of great humil or great pride said mont cristo
well when i wa a clerk morcerf wa a mere fisherman
and then he wa call
fernand
onli fernand
fernand mondego
you ar sure
pardieu i have bought enough fish of him to know hi name
then why did you think of give your daughter to him
becaus fernand and danglar be both parvenu both have becom
nobl both rich ar about equal in worth except that there have
been certain thing mention of him that were never said of me
what
oh noth
ah ye what you tell me recal to mind someth about the name of
fernand mondego i have heard that name in greec
in conjunct with the affair of ali pasha
exactli so
thi is the mysteri said danglar i acknowledg i would have given
anyth to find it out
it would be veri easi if you much wish it
how so
probabl you have some correspond in greec
i should think so
at yanina
everywher
well write to your correspond in yanina and ask him what part wa
plai by a frenchman name fernand mondego in the catastroph of ali
tepelini
you ar right exclaim danglar rise quickli i will write
todai
do so
i will
30259m
and if you should hear of anyth veri scandal
i will commun it to you
you will oblig me
danglar rush out of the room and made but on leap into hi

high disdainthes were what fix the attent of all upon him
mani men might have been handsom but certainli there could be none

everyth about the count seem to have it mean for the constant
habit of thought which he had acquir had given an eas and vigor to
the express of hi face and even to the most trifl gestur

morrel went also to the notari who confirm the new that the

cristo and heard still more franz had been to announc the ceremoni
and madam de villefort had also written to beg the count to excus her
not invit him the death of m de saintmran and the danger
ill of hi widow would cast a gloom over the meet which she
would regret should be share by the count whom she wish everi
happi
the dai befor franz had been present to madam de saintmran who
had left her bed to receiv him but had been oblig to return to it
immedi after
it is easi to suppos that morrel agit would not escap the
count penetr ey mont cristo wa more affection than
everinde hi manner wa so kind that sever time morrel wa on
the point of tell him all but he recal the promis he had made
to valentin and kept hi secret
the young man read valentin letter twenti time in the cours of the
dai it wa her first and on what an occas each time he read it he
renew hi vow to make her happi how great is the power of a woman
who ha made so courag a resolut what devot doe she deserv
from him for whom she ha sacrif everyth how ought she realli
to be suprem love she becom at onc a queen and a wife and it
is imposs to thank and love her suffici
morrel long intens for the moment when he should hear valentin
sai here i am maximilian come and help me he had arrang
everyth for her escap two ladder were hidden in the cloverfield
a cabriolet wa order for maximilian alon without a servant
without light at the turn of the first street thei would light the
lamp as it would be foolish to attract the notic of the polic by
too mani precaut occasion he shudder he thought of the
moment when from the top of that wall he should protect the descent
of hi dear valentin press in hi arm for the first time her of
whom he had yet onli kiss the delic hand
when the afternoon arriv and he felt that the hour wa draw near
he wish for solitud hi agit wa extrem a simpl question
from a friend would have irrit him he shut himself in hi room
and tri to read but hi ey glanc over the page without
understand a word and he threw awai the book and for the second
time sat down to sketch hi plan the ladder and the fenc
at length the hour drew near never did a man deepli in love allow the
clock to go on peacefulli morrel torment hi so effectu that
thei struck eight at halfpast six he then said it is time to start
the signatur wa inde fix to take place at nine oclock but
perhap valentin will not wait for that consequ morrel have
left the rue meslai at halfpast eight by hi timepiec enter the
cloverfield while the clock of saintphilippeduroul wa strike
eight the hors and cabriolet were conceal behind a small ruin
where morrel had often wait
the night gradual drew on and the foliag in the garden assum a
deeper hue then morrel came out from hi hidingplac with a beat
heart and look through the small open in the gate there wa yet
no on to be seen
the clock struck halfpast eight and still anoth halfhour wa
pass in wait while morrel walk to and fro and gaze more and
more frequent through the open the garden becam darker still
but in the dark he look in vain for the white dress and in the
silenc he vainli listen for the sound of footstep the hous which
wa discern through the tree remain in dark and gave no
indic that so import an event as the signatur of a
marriagecontract wa go on morrel look at hi watch which
want a quarter to ten but soon the same clock he had alreadi heard
strike two or three time rectifi the error by strike halfpast
nine
thi wa alreadi half an hour past the time valentin had fix it wa
a terribl moment for the young man the slightest rustl of the
foliag the least whistl of the wind attract hi attent and
drew the perspir to hi brow then he tremblingli fix hi
ladder and not to lose a moment place hi foot on the first step
amidst all these altern of hope and fear the clock struck ten
it is imposs said maximilian that the sign of a contract
should occupi so long a time without unexpect interrupt i have
weigh all the chanc calcul the time requir for all the
form someth must have happen
and then he walk rapidli to and fro and press hi burn forehead
against the fenc had valentin faint or had she been discov
and stop in her flight these were the onli obstacl which appear
possibl to the young man
the idea that her strength had fail her in attempt to escap and
that she had faint in on of the path wa the on that most
impress itself upon hi mind in that case said he i should lose
her and by my own fault he dwelt on thi idea for a moment then it
appear realiti he even thought he could perceiv someth on the
ground at a distanc he ventur to call and it seem to him that
the wind waft back an almost inarticul sigh
at last the halfhour struck it wa imposs to wait longer hi
templ throb violent hi ey were grow dim he pass on
leg over the wall and in a moment leap down on the other side he
wa on villefort premiseshad arriv there by scale the wall what
might be the consequ howev he had not ventur thu far to
draw back he follow a short distanc close under the wall then
cross a path hid enter a clump of tree in a moment he had pass
through them and could see the hous distinctli
30341m
then morrel saw that he had been right in believ that the hous wa
not illumin instead of light at everi window as is customari on
dai of ceremoni he saw onli a grai mass which wa veil also by a
cloud which at that moment obscur the moon feebl light a light
move rapidli from time to time past three window of the second floor
these three window were in madam de saintmran room anoth
remain motionless behind some red curtain which were in madam de
villefort bedroom morrel guess all thi so mani time in order
to follow valentin in thought at everi hour in the dai had he made
her describ the whole hous that without have seen it he knew it
all
thi dark and silenc alarm morrel still more than valentin
absenc had done almost mad with grief and determin to ventur
everyth in order to see valentin onc more and be certain of the
misfortun he fear morrel gain the edg of the clump of tree and
wa go to pass as quickli as possibl through the flowergarden
when the sound of a voic still at some distanc but which wa born
upon the wind reach him at thi sound as he wa alreadi partial
expos to view he step back and conceal himself complet
remain perfectli motionless
he had form hi resolut if it wa valentin alon he would speak
as she pass if she wa accompani and he could not speak still he
should see her and know that she wa safe if thei were stranger he
would listen to their convers and might understand someth of
thi hitherto incomprehens mysteri
the moon had just then escap from behind the cloud which had
conceal it and morrel saw villefort come out upon the step
follow by a gentleman in black thei descend and advanc toward
the clump of tree and morrel soon recogn the other gentleman as

two dai after a consider crowd wa assembl toward ten oclock
in the morn around the door of m de villefort hous and a long
file of mourningcoach and privat carriag extend along the
faubourg sainthonor and the rue de la ppinir among them wa on
of a veri singular form which appear to have come from a distanc
it wa a kind of cover wagon paint black and wa on of the first
to arriv inquiri wa made and it wa ascertain that by a strang
coincid thi carriag contain the corps of the marqui de
saintmran and that those who had come think to attend on funer
would follow two their number wa great the marqui de saintmran
on of the most zealou and faith dignitari of loui xviii and
king charl x had preserv a great number of friend and these
ad to the personag whom the usag of societi gave villefort a
claim on form a consider bodi
due inform wa given to the author and permiss obtain
that the two funer should take place at the same time a second
hears deck with the same funer pomp wa brought to m de
villefort door and the coffin remov into it from the postwagon
the two bodi were to be inter in the cemeteri of prelachais

in on of the mourningcoach beauchamp debrai and chteaurenaud
were talk of the veri sudden death of the marchio
i saw madam de saintmran onli last year at marseil when i wa

complet recov her reason
but of what diseas then did she die ask debrai
it is said to have been a congest of the brain or apoplexi which
is the same thing is it not
nearli
it is difficult to believ that it wa apoplexi said beauchamp
madam de saintmran whom i onc saw wa short of slender form
and of a much more nervou than sanguin tempera grief could
hardli produc apoplexi in such a constitut as that of madam de
saintmran

her m de villefort or rather mademoisel valentineor still
rather our friend franz inherit a magnific fortun amount i
believ to 80000 livr per annum
and thi fortun will be doubl at the death of the old jacobin
noirtier
that is a tenaci old grandfath said beauchamp tenacem
propos virum i think he must have made an agreement with death to
outliv all hi heir and he appear like to succe he resembl
the old conventionalist of 93 who said to napoleon in 1814 you
bend becaus your empir is a young stem weaken by rapid growth
take the republ for a tutor let us return with renew strength to
the battlefield and i promis you 500000 soldier anoth marengo

i will not answer for it said mont cristo hi father wa
introduc to me as a marqui so he ought to be a count but i do not
think he ha much claim to that titl
why said the banker if he is a princ he is wrong not to maintain
hi rank i do not like anyon to deni hi origin
oh you ar a thorough democrat said mont cristo smile
but do you see to what you ar expos yourself said the baro

chapter 78 we hear from yanina
if valentin could have seen the trembl step and agit
counten of franz when he quit the chamber of m noirtier even
she would have been constrain to piti him villefort had onli just
given utter to a few incoher sentenc and then retir to hi
studi where he receiv about two hour afterward the follow
letter
after all the disclosur which were made thi morn m noirtier de
villefort must see the utter imposs of ani allianc be form
between hi famili and that of m franz dpinai m dpinai must sai
that he is shock and astonish that m de villefort who appear to
be awar of all the circumst detail thi morn should not
have anticip him in thi announc
no on who had seen the magistr at thi moment so thoroughli
unnerv by the recent inauspici combin of circumst would
have suppos for an instant that he had anticip the annoy
although it certainli never had occur to him that hi father would
carri candor or rather rude so far as to relat such a histori
and in justic to villefort it must be understood that m noirtier
who never care for the opinion of hi son on ani subject had alwai
omit to explain the affair to villefort so that he had all hi life
entertain the belief that gener de quesnel or the baron dpinai
as he wa altern style accord as the speaker wish to
identifi him by hi own famili name or by the titl which had been
confer on him fell the victim of assassin and not that he wa
kill fairli in a duel thi harsh letter come as it did from a man
gener so polit and respect struck a mortal blow at the pride
of villefort
hardli had he read the letter when hi wife enter the sudden
departur of franz after be summon by m noirtier had so much
astonish everyon that the posit of madam de villefort left
alon with the notari and the wit becam everi moment more
embarrass determin to bear it no longer she aros and left the
room sai she would go and make some inquiri into the caus of hi
sudden disappear
m de villefort commun on the subject were veri limit and
concis he told her in fact that an explan had taken place
between m noirtier m dpinai and himself and that the marriag of
valentin and franz would consequ be broken off thi wa an
awkward and unpleas thing to have to report to those who were
wait she therefor content herself with sai that m noirtier
have at the commenc of the discuss been attack by a sort of
apoplect fit the affair would necessarili be defer for some dai
longer thi new fals as it wa follow so singularli in the train
of the two similar misfortun which had so recent occur
evid astonish the auditor and thei retir without a word
dure thi time valentin at onc terrifi and happi after have
embrac and thank the feebl old man for thu break with a singl
blow the chain which she had been accustom to consid as
irrefrag ask leav to retir to her own room in order to
recov her composur noirtier look the permiss which she
solicit but instead of go to her own room valentin have onc
gain her liberti enter the galleri and open a small door at
the end of it found herself at onc in the garden
in the midst of all the strang event which had crowd on on the
other an indefin sentiment of dread had taken possess of
valentin mind she expect everi moment that she should see morrel
appear pale and trembl to forbid the sign of the contract like
the laird of ravenswood in the bride of lammermoor
it wa high time for her to make her appear at the gate for
maximilian had long await her come he had half guess what wa
go on when he saw franz quit the cemeteri with m de villefort he
follow m dpinai saw him enter afterward go out and then
reenter with albert and chteaurenaud he had no longer ani doubt as
to the natur of the confer he therefor quickli went to the gate
in the cloverpatch prepar to hear the result of the proceed
and veri certain that valentin would hasten to him the first moment
she should be set at liberti he wa not mistaken peer through the
crevic of the wooden partit he soon discov the young girl
who cast asid all her usual precaut and walk at onc to the
barrier the first glanc which maximilian direct toward her
entir reassur him and the first word she spoke made hi heart
bound with delight
we ar save said valentin
save repeat morrel not be abl to conceiv such intens
happi by whom
by my grandfath oh morrel prai love him for all hi good to
us
morrel swore to love him with all hi soul and at that moment he could
safe promis to do so for he felt as though it were not enough to
love him mere as a friend or even as a father he worship him as a
god
but tell me valentin how ha it all been effect what strang
mean ha he us to compass thi bless end
valentin wa on the point of relat all that had pass but she
suddenli rememb that in do so she must reveal a terribl secret
which concern other as well as her grandfath and she said
at some futur time i will tell you all about it
but when will that be
when i am your wife
the convers had now turn upon a topic so pleas to morrel
that he wa readi to acced to anyth that valentin thought fit to
propos and he likewis felt that a piec of intellig such as he
just heard ought to be more than suffici to content him for on dai
howev he would not leav without the promis of see valentin
again the next night valentin promis all that morrel requir of
her and certainli it wa less difficult now for her to believ that
she should marri maximilian than it wa an hour ago to assur herself
that she should not marri franz
dure the time occupi by the interview we have just detail madam
de villefort had gone to visit m noirtier the old man look at her
with that stern and forbid express with which he wa accustom
to receiv her
sir said she it is superflu for me to tell you that valentin
marriag is broken off sinc it wa here that the affair wa
conclud
noirtier counten remain immov
but on thing i can tell you of which i do not think you ar awar
that is that i have alwai been oppos to thi marriag and that the
contract wa enter into entir without my consent or approb
noirtier regard hi daughterinlaw with the look of a man desir
an explan
now that thi marriag which i know you so much dislik is done
awai with i come to you on an errand which neither m de villefort nor
valentin could consist undertak
noirtier ey demand the natur of her mission
i come to entreat you sir continu madam de villefort as the
onli on who ha the right of do so inasmuch as i am the onli on
who will receiv no person benefit from the transactioni come to
entreat you to restor not your love for that she ha alwai
possess but to restor your fortun to your granddaught
there wa a doubt express in noirtier ey he wa evid
try to discov the motiv of thi proceed and he could not
succe in do so
mai i hope sir said madam de villefort that your intent
accord with my request
noirtier made a sign that thei did
in that case sir rejoin madam de villefort i will leav you
overwhelm with gratitud and happi at your prompt acquiesc to
my wish she then bow to m noirtier and retir
the next dai m noirtier sent for the notari the first will wa torn
up and a second made in which he left the whole of hi fortun to
valentin on condit that she should never be separ from him it
wa then gener report that mademoisel de villefort the heiress
of the marqui and marchio of saintmran had regain the good
grace of her grandfath and that she would ultim be in
possess of an incom of 300000 livr
while all the proceed rel to the dissolut of the

most favor moment for find him in hi best humor at the first
sight of hi old friend danglar assum hi majest air and settl
himself in hi easychair
morcerf usual so stiff and formal accost the banker in an affabl
and smile manner and feel sure that the overtur he wa about to
make would be well receiv he did not consid it necessari to adopt
ani manuvr in order to gain hi end but went at onc straight to
the point
40086m
well baron said he here i am at last some time ha elaps sinc
our plan were form and thei ar not yet execut
morcerf paus at these word quietli wait till the cloud should
have dispers which had gather on the brow of danglar and which he
attribut to hi silenc but on the contrari to hi great surpris
it grew darker and darker
to what do you allud monsieur said danglar as if he were try
in vain to guess at the possibl mean of the gener word
ah said morcerf i see you ar a stickler for form my dear sir
and you would remind me that the ceremoni rite should not be
omit ma foi i beg your pardon but as i have but on son and it
is the first time i have ever thought of marri him i am still

and morcerf with a forc smile aros and make a low bow to m
danglar said
baron i have the honor of ask of you the hand of mademoisel
eugni danglar for my son the vicomt albert de morcerf
but danglar instead of receiv thi address in the favor manner
which morcerf had expect knit hi brow and without invit the
count who wa still stand to take a seat he said
monsieur it will be necessari to reflect befor i give you an
answer
to reflect said morcerf more and more astonish have you not had
enough time for reflect dure the eight year which have elaps
sinc thi marriag wa first discuss between us
count said the banker thing ar constantli occur in the world
to induc us to lai asid our most establish opinion or at all
event to caus us to remodel them accord to the chang of
circumst which mai have place affair in a total differ
light to that in which we at first view them
i do not understand you baron said morcerf
what i mean to sai is thi sirthat dure the last fortnight
unforeseen circumst have occur
excus me said morcerf but is it a plai we ar act

i see him veri often said danglar draw himself up he is a
particular friend of mine
well in on of your late convers with him you said that i
appear to be forget and irresolut concern thi marriag did
you not
i did sai so
well here i am prove at onc that i am realli neither the on nor
the other by entreat you to keep your promis on that score
danglar did not answer
have you so soon chang your mind ad morcerf or have you onli
provok my request that you mai have the pleasur of see me
humbl
danglar see that if he continu the convers in the same tone
in which he had begun it the whole thing might turn out to hi own
disadvantag turn to morcerf and said
count you must doubtless be surpris at my reserv and i assur you
it cost me much to act in such a manner toward you but believ me
when i sai that imper necess ha impos the pain task upon
me
these ar all so mani empti word my dear sir said morcerf thei
might satisfi a new acquaint but the comt de morcerf doe not
rank in that list and when a man like him come to anoth recal to
him hi plight word and thi man fail to redeem the pledg he ha
at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so do
danglar wa a coward but did not wish to appear so he wa piqu at
the tone which morcerf had just assum
i am not without a good reason for my conduct repli the banker
what do you mean to sai
i mean to sai that i have a good reason but that it is difficult to
explain
you must be awar at all event that it is imposs for me to
understand motiv befor thei ar explain to me but on thing at
least is clear which is that you declin alli yourself with my
famili
no sir said danglar i mere suspend my decis that is all
and do you realli flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your
capric and quietli and humbl await the time of again be receiv
into your good grace
then count if you will not wait we must look upon these project as
if thei had never been entertain
the count bit hi lip till the blood almost start to prevent the
ebullit of anger which hi proud and irrit temper scarc
allow him to restrain understand howev that in the present
state of thing the laugh would decidedli be against him he turn
from the door toward which he had been direct hi step and again
confront the banker a cloud settl on hi brow evinc decid
anxieti and uneasi instead of the express of offend pride
which had late reign there
my dear danglar said morcerf we have been acquaint for mani
year and consequ we ought to make some allow for each
other fail you ow me an explan and realli it is but fair
that i should know what circumst ha occur to depriv my son of
your favor
it is from no person illfeel toward the viscount that is all i
can sai sir repli danglar who resum hi insol manner as
soon as he perceiv that morcerf wa a littl soften and calm
down
and toward whom do you bear thi person illfeel then said
morcerf turn pale with anger the express of the count face
had not remain unperceiv by the banker he fix on him a look of
greater assur than befor and said
you mai perhap be better satisfi that i should not go farther
into particular
a tremor of suppress rage shook the whole frame of the count and
make a violent effort over himself he said i have a right to
insist on your give me an explan is it madam de morcerf who
ha displeas you is it my fortun which you find insuffici is it
becaus my opinion differ from your
noth of the kind sir repli danglar if such had been the
case i onli should have been to blame inasmuch as i wa awar of all
these thing when i made the engag no do not seek ani longer to
discov the reason i realli am quit asham to have been the caus
of your undergo such sever selfexamin let us drop the
subject and adopt the middl cours of delai which impli neither a
ruptur nor an engag ma foi there is no hurri my daughter is
onli seventeen year old and your son twentyon while we wait time
will be progress event will succe each other thing which in
the even look dark and obscur appear but too clearli in the light
of morn and sometim the utter of on word or the laps of a
singl dai will reveal the most cruel calumni
calumni did you sai sir cri morcerf turn livid with rage
doe anyon dare to slander me
monsieur i told you that i consid it best to avoid all
explan
then sir i am patient to submit to your refus
ye sir although i assur you the refus is as pain for me to
give as it is for you to receiv for i had reckon on the honor of
your allianc and the break off of a marriag contract alwai
injur the ladi more than the gentleman
enough sir said morcerf we will speak no more on the subject
and clutch hi glove in anger he left the apart danglar
observ that dure the whole convers morcerf had never onc
dare to ask if it wa on hi own account that danglar recal hi
word
that even he had a long confer with sever friend and m
cavalcanti who had remain in the drawingroom with the ladi wa

is a littl articl on colonel fernand which if i am not mistaken
would render the explan which the comt de morcerf requir of me
perfectli unnecessari

confid
well said mont cristo what do you see in that to annoi you

by a french offic
it signifi to my father the count of morcerf whose christian name
is fernand
did your father serv under ali pasha
ye that is to sai he fought for the independ of the greek and
henc aris the calumni
oh my dear viscount do talk reason
i do not desir to do otherwis
now just tell me who the devil should know in franc that the offic
fernand and the count of morcerf ar on and the same person and who
care now about yanina which wa taken as long ago as the year 1822 or
1823
that just show the mean of thi slander thei have allow all
thi time to elaps and then all of a sudden rake up event which have
been forgotten to furnish materi for scandal in order to tarnish
the lustr of our high posit i inherit my father name and i do
not choos that the shadow of disgrac should darken it i am go to
beauchamp in whose journal thi paragraph appear and i shall insist
on hi retract the assert befor two wit
beauchamp will never retract
then we must fight
no you will not for he will tell you what is veri true that perhap
there were fifti offic in the greek armi bear the same name
we will fight nevertheless i will effac that blot on my father
charact my father who wa such a brave soldier whose career wa so
brilliant
oh well he will add we ar warrant in believ that thi
fernand is not the illustri count of morcerf who also bear the
same christian name
i am determin not to be content with anyth short of an entir
retract
and you intend to make him do it in the presenc of two wit do
you
ye
you do wrong
which mean i suppos that you refus the servic which i ask of
you
you know my theori regard duel i told you my opinion on that
subject if you rememb when we were at rome
nevertheless my dear count i found you thi morn engag in an
occup but littl consist with the notion you profess to
entertain
becaus my dear fellow you understand on must never be eccentr
if on lot is cast among fool it is necessari to studi folli i
shall perhap find myself on dai call out by some harebrain scamp
who ha no more real caus of quarrel with me than you have with
beauchamp he mai take me to task for some foolish trifl or other he
will bring hi wit or will insult me in some public place and i
am expect to kill him for all that
you admit that you would fight then well if so why do you object
to my do so
i do not sai that you ought not to fight i onli sai that a duel is a
seriou thing and ought not to be undertaken without due reflect
did he reflect befor he insult my father
if he spoke hastili and own that he did so you ought to be
satisfi
ah my dear count you ar far too indulg
and you ar far too exact suppos for instanc and do not be
angri at what i am go to sai
well
suppos the assert to be realli true
a son ought not to submit to such a stain on hi father honor
ma foi we live in time when there is much to which we must
submit
that is precis the fault of the ag
and do you undertak to reform it
ye as far as i am person concern
well you ar inde exact my dear fellow
ye i own it
ar you quit impervi to good advic
not when it come from a friend
and do you account me that titl
certainli i do
well then befor go to beauchamp with your wit seek
further inform on the subject
from whom
from hayd
why what can be the us of mix a woman up in the affairwhat can
she do in it
she can declar to you for exampl that your father had no hand
whatev in the defeat and death of the vizier or if by chanc he had
inde the misfortun to
i have told you my dear count that i would not for on moment admit
of such a proposit
you reject thi mean of inform then
i domost decidedli
then let me offer on more word of advic
do so then but let it be the last
you do not wish to hear it perhap
on the contrari i request it
do not take ani wit with you when you go to beauchampvisit him
alon
that would be contrari to all custom
your case is not an ordinari on
and what is your reason for advis me to go alon
becaus then the affair will rest between you and beauchamp
explain yourself
i will do so if beauchamp be dispos to retract you ought at least
to give him the opportun of do it of hi own free willth
satisfact to you will be the same if on the contrari he refus
to do so it will then be quit time enough to admit two stranger into
your secret
thei will not be stranger thei will be friend
ah but the friend of todai ar the enemi of tomorrow beauchamp
for instanc
so you recommend
i recommend you to be prudent
then you advis me to go alon to beauchamp
i do and i will tell you why when you wish to obtain some concess
from a man selflov you must avoid even the appear of wish
to wound it
i believ you ar right
i am glad of it
then i will go alon
go but you would do better still by not go at all
that is imposs
do so then it will be a wiser plan than the first which you
propos
but if in spite of all my precaut i am at last oblig to fight
will you not be my second
my dear viscount said mont cristo grave you must have seen
befor todai that at all time and in all place i have been at your
dispos but the servic which you have just demand of me is on
which it is out of my power to render you
why
perhap you mai know at some futur period and in the mean time i
request you to excus my declin to put you in possess of my
reason
well i will have franz and chteaurenaud thei will be the veri men
for it
do so then
but if i do fight you will sure not object to give me a lesson or
two in shoot and fenc
that too is imposs
what a singular be you arey will not interfer in anyth
you ar rightthat is the principl on which i wish to act

advic the count by ani open from the bedroom or by conceal
himself in the dressingroom would be abl to defend hi properti
himself mani attend or appar precaut would prevent the

opportun of discov an enemi whom chanc ha reveal to him who
now send thi warn to the counta warn he might not be abl to
send anoth time if thi first attempt should fail and anoth be
made
the count first idea wa that thi wa an artificea gross decept
to draw hi attent from a minor danger in order to expos him to a
greater he wa on the point of send the letter to the commissari of
polic notwithstand the advic of hi anonym friend or perhap
becaus of that advic when suddenli the idea occur to him that it

fiesco17 had done over the moor who would have kill him we know the
count vigor and dare mind deni anyth to be imposs
with that energi which mark the great man
from hi past life from hi resolut to shrink from noth the

moder the count make a signal to ali to follow him went out
by the sideg and on reach the boi de boulogn turn
appar without design toward pari and at twilight found himself
opposit hi hous in the champslys all wa dark on solitari

distant from the hous as baptistin had said
mont cristo lean against a tree and with that scrutin glanc
which wa so rare deceiv look up and down the avenu examin
the passersbi and carefulli look down the neighbor street to
see that no on wa conceal ten minut pass thu and he wa
convinc that no on wa watch him he hasten to the sidedoor
with ali enter hurriedli and by the servant staircas of which
he had the kei gain hi bedroom without open or disarrang a

secretair he doubl lock it took the kei return to the bedroom
door remov the doubl stapl of the bolt and went in meanwhil ali
had procur the arm the count requirednam a short carbin and a
pair of doublebarrel pistol with which as sure an aim might be
taken as with a singlebarrel on thu arm the count held the
live of five men in hi hand it wa about halfpast nine
the count and ali at in hast a crust of bread and drank a glass of
spanish wine then mont cristo slip asid on of the movabl
panel which enabl him to see into the adjoin room he had within
hi reach hi pistol and carbin and ali stand near him held on
of the small arabian hatchet whose form ha not vari sinc the
crusad through on of the window of the bedroom on a line with
that in the dressingroom the count could see into the street
two hour pass thu it wa intens dark still ali thank to hi
wild natur and the count thank doubtless to hi long confin
could distinguish in the dark the slightest movement of the tree
the littl light in the lodg had long been extinct it might be
expect that the attack if inde an attack wa project would be
made from the staircas of the ground floor and not from a window in
mont cristo opinion the villain sought hi life not hi monei it
would be hi bedroom thei would attack and thei must reach it by the
back staircas or by the window in the dressingroom
the clock of the invalid struck a quarter to twelv the west wind
bore on it moisten gust the dole vibrat of the three stroke
40152m
as the last stroke di awai the count thought he heard a slight nois
in the dressingroom thi first sound or rather thi first grind
wa follow by a second then a third at the fourth the count knew
what to expect a firm and wellpractis hand wa engag in cut
the four side of a pane of glass with a diamond the count felt hi
heart beat more rapidli
inur as men mai be to danger forewarn as thei mai be of peril
thei understand by the flutter of the heart and the shudder of
the frame the enorm differ between a dream and a realiti
between the project and the execut howev mont cristo onli made
a sign to appris ali who understand that danger wa approach
from the other side drew nearer to hi master mont cristo wa eager
to ascertain the strength and number of hi enemi
the window whenc the nois proceed wa opposit the open by which
the count could see into the dressingroom he fix hi ey on that
windowh distinguish a shadow in the dark then on of the pane
becam quit opaqu as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outsid
then the squar crack without fall through the open an arm wa
pass to find the fasten then a second the window turn on it
hing and a man enter he wa alon
that a dare rascal whisper the count
at that moment ali touch him slightli on the shoulder he turn ali
point to the window of the room in which thei were face the
street
i see said he there ar two of them on doe the work while the
other stand guard he made a sign to ali not to lose sight of the man
in the street and turn to the on in the dressingroom
the glasscutt had enter and wa feel hi wai hi arm
stretch out befor him at last he appear to have made himself
familiar with hi surround there were two door he bolt them
both
when he drew near to the bedroom door mont cristo expect that he
wa come in and rais on of hi pistol but he simpli heard the
sound of the bolt slide in their copper ring it wa onli a
precaut the nocturn visitor ignor of the fact that the count
had remov the stapl might now think himself at home and pursu
hi purpos with full secur alon and free to act as he wish the
man then drew from hi pocket someth which the count could not
discern place it on a stand then went straight to the secretair
felt the lock and contrari to hi expect found that the kei wa
miss but the glasscutt wa a prudent man who had provid for
all emerg the count soon heard the rattl of a bunch of
skeleton kei such as the locksmith bring when call to forc a
lock and which thiev call nightingal doubtless from the music of
their nightli song when thei grind against the bolt
ah ha whisper mont cristo with a smile of disappoint he is
onli a thief
but the man in the dark could not find the right kei he reach the
instrument he had place on the stand touch a spring and
immedi a pale light just bright enough to render object
distinct wa reflect on hi hand and counten
by heaven exclaim mont cristo start back it is
ali rais hi hatchet
dont stir whisper mont cristo and put down your hatchet we
shall requir no arm
40154m
then he ad some word in a low tone for the exclam which
surpris had drawn from the count faint as it had been had startl
the man who remain in the pose of the old knifegrind
it wa an order the count had just given for immedi ali went
noiselessli and return bear a black dress and a threecorn
hat meanwhil mont cristo had rapidli taken off hi greatcoat
waistcoat and shirt and on might distinguish by the glimmer
through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail of
which the last in franc where dagger ar no longer dread wa worn
by king loui xvi who fear the dagger at hi breast and whose head
wa cleft with a hatchet the tunic soon disappear under a long
cassock as did hi hair under a priest wig the threecorn hat
over thi effectu transform the count into an abb
the man hear noth more stood erect and while mont cristo wa
complet hi disguis had advanc straight to the secretair whose
lock wa begin to crack under hi nightingal
try again whisper the count who depend on the secret spring
which wa unknown to the picklock clever as he might betri again
you have a few minut work there
and he advanc to the window the man whom he had seen seat on a
fenc had got down and wa still pace the street but strang as it
appear he care not for those who might pass from the avenu of the
champslys or by the faubourg sainthonor hi attent wa
engross with what wa pass at the count and hi onli aim

hi intent and resign everyth to her care
albert wa punctual the journei soon becam interest from it
rapid of which morcerf had form no previou idea
truli said mont cristo with your posthors go at the rate of
two leagu an hour and that absurd law that on travel shall not
pass anoth without permiss so that an invalid or illtemp
travel mai detain those who ar well and activ it is imposs to
move i escap thi annoy by travel with my own postilion and
hors do i not ali
the count put hi head out of the window and whistl and the hors
appear to fly the carriag roll with a thunder nois over the
pavement and everyon turn to notic the dazzl meteor ali
smile repeat the sound grasp the rein with a firm hand and
spur hi hors whose beauti mane float in the breez thi
child of the desert wa in hi element and with hi black face and
sparkl ey appear in the cloud of dust he rais like the
geniu of the simoom and the god of the hurrican
i never knew till now the delight of speed said morcerf and the
last cloud disappear from hi brow but where the devil do you get
such hors ar thei made to order
precis said the count six year sinc i bought a hors in
hungari remark for it swift the thirtytwo that we shall us
tonight ar it progeni thei ar all entir black with the
except of a star upon the forehead
that is perfectli admir but what do you do count with all these
hors
you see i travel with them
but you ar not alwai travel
when i no longer requir them bertuccio will sell them and he
expect to realiz thirti or forti thousand franc by the sale
but no monarch in europ will be wealthi enough to purchas them
then he will sell them to some eastern vizier who will empti hi
coffer to purchas them and refil them by appli the bastinado to
hi subject
count mai i suggest on idea to you
certainli
it is that next to you bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in
europ
you ar mistaken viscount i believ he ha not a franc in hi
possess
then he must be a wonder my dear count if you tell me mani more
marvel thing i warn you i shall not believ them
i counten noth that is marvel m albert tell me why doe
a steward rob hi master
becaus i suppos it is hi natur to do so for the love of
rob
you ar mistaken it is becaus he ha a wife and famili and
ambiti desir for himself and them also becaus he is not sure of
alwai retain hi situat and wish to provid for the futur
now m bertuccio is alon in the world he us my properti without
account for the us he make of it he is sure never to leav my
servic
why
becaus i should never get a better
probabl ar decept
but i deal in certainti he is the best servant over whom on ha
the power of life and death

have ani more to do with the affair how did the honor or disgrac of
m de morcerf affect me it neither increas nor decreas my incom
albert felt the blood mount to hi brow there wa no doubt upon the
subject danglar defend himself with the base but at the same
time with the assur of a man who speak the truth at least in
part if not whollynot for conscienc sake but through fear
besid what wa morcerf seek it wa not whether danglar or mont
cristo wa more or less guilti it wa a man who would answer for the
offenc whether trifl or seriou it wa a man who would fight and
it wa evid danglar would not fight
in addit to thi everyth forgotten or unperceiv befor
present itself now to hi recollect mont cristo knew everyth
as he had bought the daughter of ali pasha and know everyth he
had advis danglar to write to yanina the answer known he had
yield to albert wish to be introduc to hayd and allow the
convers to turn on the death of ali and had not oppos hayd
recit but have doubtless warn the young girl in the few
romaic word he spoke to her not to implic morcerf father
besid had he not beg of morcerf not to mention hi father name
befor hayd lastli he had taken albert to normandi when he knew the
final blow wa near there could be no doubt that all had been
calcul and previous arrang mont cristo then wa in leagu
with hi father enemi albert took beauchamp asid and
commun these idea to him

secondari agent in thi sad affair and it is of m de mont cristo
that you must demand an explan

leav of you i must ascertain if your insinu ar just and am
go now to inquir of the count of mont cristo

you must demand an explan
ye and we ar go to hi hous
reflect morcerf on moment befor you go

ye m danglar is a moneylov and those who love monei you know
think too much of what thei risk to be easili induc to fight a duel
the other is on the contrari to all appear a true nobleman but
do you not fear to find him a bulli
i onli fear on thing name to find a man who will not fight
do not be alarm said beauchamp he will meet you my onli fear is
that he will be too strong for you
my friend said morcerf with a sweet smile that is what i wish
the happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my
father stead that would save us all
your mother would die of grief
my poor mother said albert pass hi hand across hi ey i

fulli the theme of our convers i will answer them both and
contrari to the usual method the last first becaus it is the least
difficult i have chosen the drawingroom sir as our place of

idea present itself and whisper in hi ear that he had slept too
long he jump out of bed and ran to the window a gendarm wa
cross the court a gendarm is on of the most strike object in
the world even to a man void of uneasi but for on who ha a
timid conscienc and with good caus too the yellow blue and white
uniform is realli veri alarm
why is that gendarm there ask andrea of himself
then all at onc he repli with that logic which the reader ha
doubtless remark in him there is noth astonish in see a
gendarm at an inn instead of be astonish let me dress myself
and the youth dress himself with a facil hi valet de chambr had
fail to rob him of dure the two month of fashion life he had
led in pari

50047m
and sai thi andrea who had now put on hi boot and cravat
stole gentli to the window and a second time lift up the muslin
curtain not onli wa the first gendarm still there but the young man
now perceiv a second yellow blue and white uniform at the foot of
the staircas the onli on by which he could descend while a third

appear of the third gendarm settl the matter for a crowd of
curiou lounger wa extend befor him effectu block the
entranc to the hotel
theyr after me wa andrea first thought diabl
a pallor overspread the young man forehead and he look around him
with anxieti hi room like all those on the same floor had but on
outlet to the galleri in the sight of everybodi i am lost wa hi
second thought and inde for a man in andrea situat an arrest
meant the assiz trial and deathdeath without merci or delai
for a moment he convuls press hi head within hi hand and
dure that brief period he becam nearli mad with terror but soon a
rai of hope glimmer in the multitud of thought which bewild hi
mind and a faint smile plai upon hi white lip and pallid cheek
he look around and saw the object of hi search upon the
chimneypiec thei were a pen ink and paper with forc composur
he dip the pen in the ink and wrote the follow line upon a
sheet of paper
i have no monei to pai my bill but i am not a dishonest man i leav
behind me as a pledg thi pin worth ten time the amount i shall be
excus for leav at daybreak for i wa asham
he then drew the pin from hi cravat and place it on the paper thi
done instead of leav the door fasten he drew back the bolt and
even place the door ajar as though he had left the room forget
to close it and slip into the chimnei like a man accustom to
that kind of gymnast exercis after replac the chimneyboard
which repres achil with deidamia and effac the veri mark

which seem to impli that she understood all her mother amor and
pecuniari relationship with the intim secretari moreov she saw
that eugni detest debrai not onli becaus he wa a sourc of

onc class him in that catalogu of bipe whom plato endeavor to
withdraw from the appel of men and whom diogen design as
anim upon two leg without feather
unfortun in thi world of our each person view thing through
a certain medium and so is prevent from see in the same light as

her apart contigu as we know to that of eugni she wa
fear of excit ani remark and believ firmli in her daughter
innoc and fidel to the patern roof she listen at eugni

madam danglar then conclud that the young girl had been overcom
with the terribl excit of the even and had gone to bed and to
sleep she call the maid and question her
mademoisel eugni said the maid retir to her apart with
mademoisel darmilli thei then took tea togeth after which thei
desir me to leav sai that thei need me no longer
sinc then the maid had been below and like everyon els she thought
the young ladi were in their own room madam danglar therefor
went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the
recent event in proport as her memori becam clearer the
occurr of the even were reveal in their true light what she
had taken for confus wa a tumult what she had regard as
someth distress wa in realiti a disgrac and then the baro
rememb that she had felt no piti for poor mercd who had been
afflict with as sever a blow through her husband and son
eugni she said to herself is lost and so ar we the affair as
it will be report will cover us with shame for in a societi such as
our satir inflict a pain and incur wound how fortun that
eugni is possess of that strang charact which ha so often made
me trembl
and her glanc wa turn toward heaven where a mysteri provid
dispos all thing and out of a fault nai even a vice sometim
produc a bless and then her thought cleav through space like
a bird in the air rest on cavalcanti thi andrea wa a wretch a
robber an assassin and yet hi manner show the effect of a sort
of educ if not a complet on he had been present to the world
with the appear of an immens fortun support by an honor
name how could she extric herself from thi labyrinth to whom
would she appli to help her out of thi pain situat debrai to
whom she had run with the first instinct of a woman toward the man
she love and who yet betrai herdebrai could but give her advic
she must appli to someon more power than he
the baro then thought of m de villefort it wa m de villefort
who had remorselessli brought misfortun into her famili as though
thei had been stranger but no on reflect the procureur wa not
a merciless man and it wa not the magistr slave to hi duti
but the friend the loyal friend who roughli but firmli cut into the
veri core of the corrupt it wa not the execution but the
surgeon who wish to withdraw the honor of danglar from ignomini
associ with the disgrac young man thei had present to the
world as their soninlaw and sinc villefort the friend of danglar
had act in thi wai no on could suppos that he had been previous
acquaint with or had lent himself to ani of andrea intrigu
villefort conduct therefor upon reflect appear to the
baro as if shape for their mutual advantag but the inflex
of the procureur should stop there she would see him the next dai and
if she could not make him fail in hi duti as a magistr she
would at least obtain all the indulg he could allow she would
invok the past recal old recollect she would supplic him by
the remembr of guilti yet happi dai m de villefort would stifl
the affair he had onli to turn hi ey on on side and allow andrea
to fly and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt call
contempt of court and after thi reason she slept easili
at nine oclock next morn she aros and without ring for her
maid or give the least sign of her activ she dress herself in
the same simpl style as on the previou night then run
downstair she left the hotel walk to the rue de provenc call a

maze altern review her own situat and the event she had

come let us endeavor to get to the end of our stori beauchamp i
told you that yesterdai madam made inquiri of me upon the subject
enlighten me and i will then commun my inform to her

young edward a burst of laughter from the auditor did not in the
least disconcert the speaker who continuedy gentlemen edward

chapter 113 the past
the count depart with a sad heart from the hous in which he had left
mercd probabl never to behold her again sinc the death of littl
edward a great chang had taken place in mont cristo have reach
the summit of hi vengeanc by a long and tortuou path he saw an
abyss of doubt yawn befor him more than thi the convers
which had just taken place between mercd and himself had awaken so
mani recollect in hi heart that he felt it necessari to combat
with them a man of the count tempera could not long indulg in
that melancholi which can exist in common mind but which destroi
superior on he thought he must have made an error in hi
calcul if he now found caus to blame himself
i cannot have deceiv myself he said i must look upon the past in
a fals light what he continu can i have been follow a fals
pathcan the end which i propos be a mistaken endcan on hour have
suffic to prove to an architect that the work upon which he found
all hi hope wa an imposs if not a sacrilegi undertak i
cannot reconcil myself to thi ideait would madden me the reason why
i am now dissatisfi is that i have not a clear appreci of the
past the past like the countri through which we walk becom
indistinct as we advanc my posit is like that of a person wound
in a dream he feel the wound though he cannot recollect when he
receiv it
come then thou regener man thou extravag prodig thou

millionaireonc again review thy past life of starvat and
wretched revisit the scene where fate and misfortun conduct
and where despair receiv thee too mani diamond too much gold and
splendor ar now reflect by the mirror in which mont cristo seek
to behold dant hide thy diamond buri thy gold shroud thy
splendor exchang rich for poverti liberti for a prison a live
bodi for a corps
as he thu reason mont cristo walk down the rue de la caisseri
it wa the same through which twentyfour year ago he had been
conduct by a silent and nocturn guard the hous todai so smile
and anim were on that night dark mute and close
and yet thei were the same murmur mont cristo onli now it is
broad daylight instead of night it is the sun which brighten the
place and make it appear so cheer
he proceed toward the quai by the rue saintlaur and advanc to
the consign it wa the point where he had embark a pleasureboat
with stripe awn wa go by mont cristo call the owner who
immedi row up to him with the eager of a boatman hope for
a good fare
the weather wa magnific and the excurs a treat the sun red
and flame wa sink into the embrac of the welcom ocean the
sea smooth as crystal wa now and then disturb by the leap of
fish which were pursu by some unseen enemi and sought for safeti in
anoth element while on the extrem verg of the horizon might be
seen the fishermen boat white and grace as the seagul or the
merchant vessel bound for corsica or spain
but notwithstand the seren sky the gracefulli form boat and
the golden light in which the whole scene wa bath the count of
mont cristo wrap in hi cloak could think onli of thi terribl
voyag the detail of which were on by on recal to hi memori
the solitari light burn at the catalan that first sight of the
chteau dif which told him whither thei were lead him the
struggl with the gendarm when he wish to throw himself overboard
hi despair when he found himself vanquish and the sensat when
the muzzl of the carbin touch hi foreheadal these were brought
befor him in vivid and fright realiti
like the stream which the heat of the summer ha dri up and which
after the autumn storm gradual begin ooz drop by drop so did
the count feel hi heart gradual fill with the bitter which
formerli nearli overwhelm edmond dant clear sky swiftflit
boat and brilliant sunshin disappear the heaven were hung with
black and the gigant structur of the chteau dif seem like the
phantom of a mortal enemi as thei reach the shore the count
instinct shrunk to the extrem end of the boat and the owner wa
oblig to call out in hi sweetest tone of voic
sir we ar at the land
mont cristo rememb that on that veri spot on the same rock he
had been violent drag by the guard who forc him to ascend the
slope at the point of their bayonet the journei had seem veri long
to dant but mont cristo found it equal short each stroke of the
oar seem to awaken a new throng of idea which sprang up with the
fly sprai of the sea
50219m
there had been no prison confin in the chteau dif sinc the
revolut of juli it wa onli inhabit by a guard kept there for
the prevent of smuggl a concierg wait at the door to exhibit
to visitor thi monument of curios onc a scene of terror
the count inquir whether ani of the ancient jailer were still there
but thei had all been pension or had pass on to some other
employ the concierg who attend him had onli been there sinc
1830 he visit hi own dungeon he again beheld the dull light vainli
endeavor to penetr the narrow open hi ey rest upon the
spot where had stood hi bed sinc then remov and behind the bed
the new stone indic where the breach made by the abb faria had
been mont cristo felt hi limb trembl he seat himself upon a log
of wood
ar there ani stori connect with thi prison besid the on
relat to the poison of mirabeau ask the count ar there ani
tradit respect these dismal abodesin which it is difficult to
believ men can ever have imprison their fellowcreatur
ye sir inde the jailer antoin told me on connect with thi
veri dungeon
mont cristo shudder antoin had been hi jailer he had almost
forgotten hi name and face but at the mention of the name he recal
hi person as he us to see it the face encircl by a beard wear
the brown jacket the bunch of kei the jingl of which he still
seem to hear the count turn around and fanci he saw him in the
corridor render still darker by the torch carri by the concierg
would you like to hear the stori sir
ye relat it said mont cristo press hi hand to hi heart to
still it violent beat he felt afraid of hear hi own histori
thi dungeon said the concierg wa it appear some time ago
occupi by a veri danger prison the more so sinc he wa full of
industri anoth person wa confin in the chteau at the same time
but he wa not wick he wa onli a poor mad priest
ah indeedmad repeat mont cristo and what wa hi mania
he offer million to anyon who would set him at liberti
mont cristo rais hi ey but he could not see the heaven there
wa a stone veil between him and the firmament he thought that there
had been no less thick a veil befor the ey of those to whom faria
offer the treasur
could the prison see each other he ask
oh no sir it wa expressli forbidden but thei elud the vigil
of the guard and made a passag from on dungeon to the other
and which of them made thi passag
oh it must have been the young man certainli for he wa strong and
industri while the abb wa ag and weak besid hi mind wa
too vacil to allow him to carri out an idea
blind fool murmur the count
howev be that as it mai the young man made a tunnel how or by
what mean no on know but he made it and there is the evid yet
remain of hi work do you see it and the man held the torch to
the wall
50223m
ah ye i see said the count in a voic hoars from emot
the result wa that the two men commun with on anoth how
long thei did so nobodi know on dai the old man fell ill and di
now guess what the young on did
tell me
he carri off the corps which he place in hi own bed with it
face to the wall then he enter the empti dungeon close the
entranc and slip into the sack which had contain the dead bodi
did you ever hear of such an idea
mont cristo close hi ey and seem again to experi all the
sensat he had felt when the coars canva yet moist with the cold
dew of death had touch hi face
the jailer continu
now thi wa hi project he fanci that thei buri the dead at the
chteau dif and imagin thei would not expend much labor on the
grave of a prison he calcul on rais the earth with hi
shoulder but unfortun their arrang at the chteau
frustrat hi project thei never buri the dead thei mere
attach a heavi cannonbal to the feet and then threw them into the
sea thi is what wa done the young man wa thrown from the top of
the rock the corps wa found on the bed next dai and the whole truth
wa guess for the men who perform the offic then mention what

that he wa still be carri with great rapid over the same
countri thickli strewn with broken aqueduct which look like
granit giant petrifi while run a race but the night wa cold
dull and raini and it wa much more pleasant for a travel to
remain in the warm carriag than to put hi head out of the window to
make inquiri of a postilion whose onli answer wa non capisco

danglar therefor continu to sleep sai to himself that he would
be sure to awak at the postinghous the carriag stop danglar

three men stand silent form a triangl of which he wa the
centr he wish to speak but hi tongu refus to move

thi time danglar had doubl reason to understand for if the word and
gestur had not explain the speaker mean it wa clearli
express by the man walk behind him who push him so rude that
he struck against the guid thi guid wa our friend peppino who
dash into the thicket of high weed through a path which none but
lizard or polecat could have imagin to be an open road
peppino stop befor a rock overhung by thick hedg the rock half
open afford a passag to the young man who disappear like the
evil spirit in the fairi tale the voic and gestur of the man who

it would have been imposs for him to pass through the midst of the
garrison who held the catacomb of st sebastian encamp round a
master whom our reader must have recogn as the famou luigi vampa
danglar too had recogn the bandit whose exist he would not
believ when albert de morcerf mention him in pari and not onli did
he recogn him but the cell in which albert had been confin and
which wa probabl kept for the accommod of stranger these
recollect were dwelt upon with some pleasur by danglar and

danglar resembl a timid anim excit in the chase first it fli
then despair and at last by the veri forc of desper sometim

miracl were possiblethat the accurs cavern might be discov by
the offic of the papal state who would releas him that then he
would have 50000 remain which would be suffici to save him from
starvat and final he prai that thi sum might be preserv to

pick up everi crumb that had been left from hi former meal and wa
begin to eat the mat which cover the floor of hi cell then
he entreat peppino as he would a guardian angel to give him food
he offer him 1000 franc for a mouth of bread but peppino did
not answer on the fifth dai he drag himself to the door of the
cell

danglar thought of the old man whom in hi hour of delirium he had
seen groan on hi bed he struck hi forehead on the ground and
groan ye he said there have been some who have suffer more
than i have but then thei must have been martyr at least
do you repent ask a deep solemn voic which caus danglar

listen to me as to a man whose thought ar rais to heaven though
he remain on earth i come to die in the arm of a friend certainli
there ar peopl whom i love i love my sister juliei love her

morrel utter these word with an energi which made the count shudder
my friend continu morrel you name the fifth of octob as the

be it so said the count come morrel mechan follow the
count and thei had enter the grotto befor he perceiv it he felt
a carpet under hi feet a door open perfum surround him and a
brilliant light dazzl hi ey morrel hesit to advanc he
dread the enerv effect of all that he saw mont cristo drew him
in gentli
why should we not spend the last three hour remain to us of life
like those ancient roman who when condemn by nero their emperor
and heir sat down at a tabl cover with flower and gentli glide
into death amid the perfum of heliotrop and rose
morrel smile as you pleas he said death is alwai deaththat
is forget repos exclus from life and therefor from

there is someth true in what you sai said the count with that
smile which made him so handsom i have descend from a planet
call grief
50269m
i believ all you tell me without question it mean for
instanc you told me to live and i did live you told me to hope and
i almost did so i am almost inclin to ask you as though you had
experienc death is it pain to die
mont cristo look upon morrel with indescrib tender ye
he said ye doubtless it is pain if you violent break the
outer cover which obstin beg for life if you plung a dagger
into your flesh if you insinu a bullet into your brain which the
least shock disordersthen certainli you will suffer pain and you
will repent quit a life for a repos you have bought at so dear a
price
ye i know that there is a secret of luxuri and pain in death as
well as in life the onli thing is to understand it
you have spoken truli maximilian accord to the care we bestow
upon it death is either a friend who rock us gentli as a nurs or an
enemi who violent drag the soul from the bodi some dai when the
