i purpos in return for the honour you do us by come to see what ar
our proceed here to bring befor you in the cours of these
lectur the chemic histori of a candl i have taken thi subject on a
former occas and were it left to my own will i should prefer to
repeat it almost everi yearso abund is the interest that attach
itself to the subject so wonder ar the varieti of outlet which it
offer into the variou depart of philosophi there is not a law
under which ani part of thi univers is govern which doe not come into
plai and is touch upon in these phenomena there is no better there is
no more open door by which you can enter into the studi of natur
philosophi than by consid the physic phenomena of a candl i
trust therefor i shall not disappoint you in choos thi for my
subject rather than ani newer topic which could not be better were it
even so good
and befor proceed let me sai thi alsothat though our subject be so
great and our intent that of treat it honestli serious and
philosoph yet i mean to pass awai from all those who ar senior
amongst us i claim the privileg of speak to juvenil as a juvenil
myself i have done so on former occasionsand if you pleas i shall do
so again and though i stand here with the knowledg of have the word i
utter given to the world yet that shall not deter me from speak in the
same familiar wai to those whom i esteem nearest to me on thi occas
and now my boi and girl i must first tell you of what candl ar
made some ar great curios i have here some bit of timber
branch of tree particularli famou for their burn and here you see
a piec of that veri curiou substanc taken out of some of the bog in
ireland call candlewooda hard strong excel wood evid
fit for good work as a resist of forc and yet withal burn so
well that where it is found thei make splinter of it and torch sinc
it burn like a candl and give a veri good light inde and in thi
wood we have on of the most beauti illustr of the gener natur
of a candl that i can possibl give the fuel provid the mean of
bring that fuel to the place of chemic action the regular and
gradual suppli of air to that place of actionheat and lightal
produc by a littl piec of wood of thi kind form in fact a
natur candl
but we must speak of candl as thei ar in commerc here ar a coupl of
candl commonli call dip thei ar made of length of cotton cut off
hung up by a loop dip into melt tallow taken out again and cool
then redip until there is an accumul of tallow round the cotton
in order that you mai have an idea of the variou charact of these
candl you see these which i hold in my handthei ar veri small and
veri curiou thei ar or were the candl us by the miner in coal
mine in olden time the miner had to find hi own candl and it wa
suppos that a small candl would not so soon set fire to the firedamp
in the coal mine as a larg on and for that reason as well as for
economi sake he had candl made of thi sort20 30 40 or 60 to the
pound thei have been replac sinc then by the steelmil and then by
the davylamp and other safetylamp of variou kind i have here a
candl that wa taken out of the royal george1 it is said by colonel
paslei it ha been sunk in the sea for mani year subject to the action
of salt water it shew you how well candl mai be preserv for though
it is crack about and broken a good deal yet when light it goe on
burn regularli and the tallow resum it natur condit as soon as
it is fuse
mr field of lambeth ha suppli me abundantli with beauti
illustr of the candl and it materi i shall therefor now refer
to them and first there is the suetth fat of the oxrussian tallow
i believ emploi in the manufactur of these dip which gai lussac or
some on who entrust him with hi knowledg convert into that
beauti substanc stearin which you see ly besid it a candl you
know is not now a greasi thing like an ordinari tallow candl but a
clean thing and you mai almost scrape off and pulveris the drop which
fall from it without soil anyth thi is the process he
adopted2th fat or tallow is first boil with quicklim and made
into a soap and then the soap is decompos by sulphur acid which
take awai the lime and leav the fat rearrang as stearic acid
whilst a quantiti of glycerin is produc at the same time
glycerinabsolut a sugar or a substanc similar to sugarcom out
of the tallow in thi chemic chang the oil is then press out of it
and you see here thi seri of press cake shew how beautifulli the
impur ar carri out by the oili part as the pressur goe on
increas and at last you have left that substanc which is melt and
cast into candl as here repres the candl i have in my hand is a
stearin candl made of stearin from tallow in the wai i have told you
then here is a sperm candl which come from the purifi oil of the
spermaceti whale here also ar yellow beeswax and refin beeswax from
which candl ar made here too is that curiou substanc call
paraffin and some paraffin candl made of paraffin obtain from the
bog of ireland i have here also a substanc brought from japan sinc we
have forc an entranc into that outofthewai placea sort of wax
which a kind friend ha sent me and which form a new materi for the
manufactur of candl
and how ar these candl made i have told you about dip and i will
shew you how mould ar made let us imagin ani of these candl to be
made of materi which can be cast cast you sai why a candl is a
thing that melt and sure if you can melt it you can cast it not so
it is wonder in the progress of manufactur and in the consider
of the mean best fit to produc the requir result how thing turn
up which on would not expect beforehand candl cannot alwai be cast a
wax candl can never be cast it is made by a particular process which i
can illustr in a minut or two but i must not spend much time on it
wax is a thing which burn so well and melt so easili in a candl
cannot be cast howev let us take a materi that can be cast here is
a frame with a number of mould fasten in it the first thing to be
done is to put a wick through them here is onea plait wick which
doe not requir snuffing3support by a littl wire it goe to the
bottom where it is peg inth littl peg hold the cotton tight
and stop the apertur so that noth fluid shall run out at the
upper part there is a littl bar place across which stretch the cotton
and hold it in the mould the tallow is then melt and the mould ar
fill after a certain time when the mould ar cool the excess of
tallow is pour off at on corner and then clean off altogeth and
the end of the wick cut awai the candl alon then remain in the mould
and you have onli to upset them as i am do when out thei tumbl for
the candl ar made in the form of cone be narrow at the top than
at the bottom so that what with their form and their own shrink thei
onli need a littl shake and out thei fall in the same wai ar made
these candl of stearin and of paraffin it is a curiou thing to see how
wax candl ar made a lot of cotton ar hung upon frame as you see
here and cover with metal tag at the end to keep the wax from
cover the cotton in those place these ar carri to a heater where
the wax is melt as you see the frame can turn round and as thei
turn a man take a vessel of wax and pour it first down on and then
the next and the next and so on when he ha gone onc round if it is
suffici cool he give the first a second coat and so on until thei
ar all of the requir thick when thei have been thu cloth or
fed or made up to that thick thei ar taken off and place
elsewher i have here by the kind of mr field sever specimen of
these candl here is on onli halffinish thei ar then taken down
and well roll upon a fine stone slab and the conic top is mould by
properli shape tube and the bottom cut off and trim thi is done
so beautifulli that thei can make candl in thi wai weigh exactli
four or six to the pound or ani number thei pleas
we must not howev take up more time about the mere manufactur but go
a littl further into the matter i have not yet refer you to luxuri
in candl for there is such a thing as luxuri in candl see how
beautifulli these ar colour you see here mauv magenta and all the
chemic colour recent introduc appli to candl you observ
also differ form emploi here is a flute pillar most beautifulli
shape and i have also here some candl sent me by mr pearsal which
ar ornament with design upon them so that as thei burn you have as it
were a glow sun abov and a bouquet of flower beneath all howev
that is fine and beauti is not us these flute candl pretti as
thei ar ar bad candl thei ar bad becaus of their extern shape
nevertheless i shew you these specimen sent to me from kind friend on
all side that you mai see what is done and what mai be done in thi or
that direct although as i have said when we come to these
refin we ar oblig to sacrific a littl in util
now as to the light of the candl we will light on or two and set them
at work in the perform of their proper function you observ a candl
is a veri differ thing from a lamp with a lamp you take a littl oil
fill your vessel put in a littl moss or some cotton prepar by
artifici mean and then light the top of the wick when the flame run
down the cotton to the oil it get extinguish but it goe on burn
in the part abov now i have no doubt you will ask how is it that the
oil which will not burn of itself get up to the top of the cotton
where it will burn we shall present examin that but there is a much
more wonder thing about the burn of a candl than thi you have
here a solid substanc with no vessel to contain it and how is it that
thi solid substanc can get up to the place where the flame is how is it
that thi solid get there it not be a fluid or when it is made a
fluid then how is it that it keep togeth thi is a wonder thing
about a candl
we have here a good deal of wind which will help us in some of our
illustr but teas us in other for the sake therefor of a
littl regular and to simplifi the matter i shall make a quiet
flamefor who can studi a subject when there ar difficulti in the wai
not belong to it here is a clever invent of some costermong or
street stander in the marketplac for the shade of their candl on
saturdai night when thei ar sell their green or potato or fish
i have veri often admir it thei put a lampglass round the candl
support on a kind of galleri which clasp it and it can be slip up
and down as requir by the us of thi lampglass emploi in the same
wai you have a steadi flame which you can look at and carefulli
examin as i hope you will do at home
you see then in the first instanc that a beauti cup is form as
the air come to the candl it move upward by the forc of the current
which the heat of the candl produc and it so cool all the side of
the wax tallow or fuel as to keep the edg much cooler than the part
within the part within melt by the flame that run down the wick as far
as it can go befor it is extinguish but the part on the outsid doe
not melt if i made a current in on direct my cup would be lopsid
and the fluid would consequ run overfor the same forc of graviti
which hold world togeth hold thi fluid in a horizont posit and
if the cup be not horizont of cours the fluid will run awai in
gutter you see therefor that the cup is form by thi beautifulli
regular ascend current of air plai upon all side which keep the
exterior of the candl cool no fuel would serv for a candl which ha
not the properti of give thi cup except such fuel as the irish
bogwood where the materi itself is like a spong and hold it own
fuel you see now why you would have had such a bad result if you were to
burn these beauti candl that i have shewn you which ar irregular
intermitt in their shape and cannot therefor have that nicelyform
edg to the cup which is the great beauti in a candl i hope you will now
see that the perfect of a processthat is it utilityi the better
point of beauti about it it is not the best look thing but the best
act thing which is the most advantag to us thi goodlook
candl is a bad burn on there will be a gutter round about it
becaus of the irregular of the stream of air and the bad of the
cup which is form therebi you mai see some pretti exampl and i trust
you will notic these instanc of the action of the ascend current
when you have a littl gutter run down the side of a candl make it
thicker there than it is elsewher as the candl goe on burn that
keep it place and form a littl pillar stick up by the side
becaus as it rise higher abov the rest of the wax or fuel the air
get better round it and it is more cool and better abl to resist the
action of the heat at a littl distanc now the greatest mistak and
fault with regard to candl as in mani other thing often bring with
them instruct which we should not receiv if thei had not occur we
come here to be philosoph and i hope you will alwai rememb that
whenev a result happen especi if it be new you should sai what
is the caus why doe it occur and you will in the cours of time find
out the reason
then there is anoth point about these candl which will answer a
questionthat is as to the wai in which thi fluid get out of the cup
up the wick and into the place of combust you know that the flame on
these burn wick in candl made of beeswax stearin or spermaceti do
not run down to the wax or other matter and melt it all awai but keep to
their own right place thei ar fenc off from the fluid below and do
not encroach on the cup at the side i cannot imagin a more beauti
exampl than the condit of adjust under which a candl make on
part subserv to the other to the veri end of it action a combust
thing like that burn awai gradual never be intrud upon by the
flame is a veri beauti sight especi when you come to learn what a
vigor thing flame iswhat power it ha of destroi the wax itself
when it get hold of it and of disturb it proper form if it come onli
too near
but how doe the flame get hold of the fuel there is a beauti point
about thatcapillari attraction4 capillari attract you
sayth attract of hair well never mind the name it wa given
in old time befor we had a good understand of what the real power
wa it is by what is call capillari attract that the fuel is
convei to the part where combust goe on and is deposit there not
in a careless wai but veri beautifulli in the veri midst of the centr of
action which take place around it now i am go to give you on or two
instanc of capillari attract it is that kind of action or attract
which make two thing that do not dissolv in each other still hold
togeth when you wash your hand you wet them thoroughli you take a
littl soap to make the adhes better and you find your hand remain
wet thi is by that kind of attract of which i am about to speak and
what is more if your hand ar not soil as thei almost alwai ar by
the usag of life if you put your finger into a littl warm water the
water will creep a littl wai up the finger though you mai not stop to
examin it i have here a substanc which is rather porousa column of
saltand i will pour into the plate at the bottom not water as it
appear but a satur solut of salt which cannot absorb more so
that the action which you see will not be due to it dissolv anyth
we mai consid the plate to be the candl and the salt the wick and
thi solut the melt tallow i have colour the fluid that you mai
see the action better you observ that now i pour in the fluid it
rise and gradual creep up the salt higher and higher and provid the
column doe not tumbl over it will go to the top
illustr fig 1
if thi blue solut were combust and we were to place a wick at the
top of the salt it would burn as it enter into the wick it is a most
curiou thing to see thi kind of action take place and to observ how
singular some of the circumst ar about it when you wash your hand
you take a towel to wipe off the water and it is by that kind of wet
or that kind of attract which make the towel becom wet with water
that the wick is made wet with the tallow i have known some careless boi
and girl inde i have known it happen to care peopl as well who
have wash their hand and wipe them with a towel have thrown the
towel over the side of the basin and befor long it ha drawn all the
water out of the basin and convei it to the floor becaus it happen
to be thrown over the side in such a wai as to serv the purpos of a
syphon5 that you mai the better see the wai in which the substanc act
on upon anoth i have here a vessel made of wire gauz fill with
water and you mai compar it in it action to the cotton in on respect
or to a piec of calico in the other in fact wick ar sometim made of
a kind of wire gauz you will observ that thi vessel is a porou thing
for if i pour a littl water on to the top it will run out at the bottom
you would be puzzl for a good while if i ask you what the state of
thi vessel is what is insid it and why it is there the vessel is full
of water and yet you see the water goe in and run out as if it were
empti in order to prove thi to you i have onli to empti it the reason
is thisth wire be onc wet remain wet the mesh ar so
small that the fluid is attract so strongli from the on side to the
other as to remain in the vessel although it is porou in like manner
the particl of melt tallow ascend the cotton and get to the top other
particl then follow by their mutual attract for each other and as
thei reach the flame thei ar gradual burn
here is anoth applic of the same principl you see thi bit of
cane i have seen boi about the street who ar veri anxiou to appear
like men take a piec of cane and light it and smoke it as an imit
of a cigar thei ar enabl to do so by the permeabl of the cane in
on direct and by it capillar if i place thi piec of cane on a
plate contain some camphin which is veri much like paraffin in it
gener charact exactli in the same manner as the blue fluid rose
through the salt will thi fluid rise through the piec of cane there
be no pore at the side the fluid cannot go in that direct but
must pass through it length alreadi the fluid is at the top of the cane
now i can light it and make it serv as a candl the fluid ha risen by
the capillari attract of the piec of cane just as it doe through the
cotton in the candl
now the onli reason why the candl doe not burn all down the side of the
wick is that the melt tallow extinguish the flame you know that a
candl if turn upsidedown so as to allow the fuel to run upon the
wick will be put out the reason is that the flame ha not had time to
make the fuel hot enough to burn as it doe abov where it is carri in
small quantiti into the wick and ha all the effect of the heat
exercis upon it
there is anoth condit which you must learn as regard the candl
without which you would not be abl fulli to understand the philosophi of
it and that is the vapor condit of the fuel in order that you mai
understand that let me shew you a veri pretti but veri commonplac
experi if you blow a candl out cleverli you will see the vapour
rise from it you have i know often smelt the vapour of a blownout
candleand a veri bad smell it is but if you blow it out cleverli you
will be abl to see pretti well the vapour into which thi solid matter is
transform i will blow out on of these candl in such a wai as not to
disturb the air around it by the continu action of my breath and now
if i hold a light taper two or three inch from the wick you will
observ a train of fire go through the air till it reach the candl
i am oblig to be quick and readi becaus if i allow the vapour time to
cool it becom condens into a liquid or solid or the stream of
combust matter get disturb
now as to the shape or form of the flame it concern us much to know
about the condit which the matter of the candl final assum at the
top of the wickwher you have such beauti and bright as noth but
combust or flame can produc
illustr fig 2
you have the glitter beauti of gold and silver and the still higher
lustr of jewel like the rubi and diamond but none of these rival the
brillianc and beauti of flame what diamond can shine like flame it ow
it lustr at nighttim to the veri flame shine upon it the flame
shine in dark but the light which the diamond ha is as noth
until the flame shine upon it when it is brilliant again the candl
alon shine by itself and for itself or for those who have arrang the
materi now let us look a littl at the form of the flame as you see
it under the glass shade it is steadi and equal and it gener form is
that which is repres in the diagram vari with atmospher
disturb and also vari accord to the size of the candl it is
a bright oblongbright at the top than toward the bottomwith the
wick in the middl and besid the wick in the middl certain darker
part toward the bottom where the ignit is not so perfect as in the
part abov
illustr fig 3
i have a draw here sketch mani year ago by hook when he made hi
investig it is the draw of the flame of a lamp but it will
appli to the flame of a candl the cup of the candl is the vessel or
lamp the melt spermaceti is the oil and the wick is common to both
upon that he set thi littl flame and then he repres what is
truea certain quantiti of matter rise about it which you do not see
and which if you have not been here befor or ar not familiar with the
subject you will not know of he ha here repres the part of the
surround atmospher that ar veri essenti to the flame and that ar
alwai present with it there is a current form which draw the flame
outfor the flame which you see is realli drawn out by the current and
drawn upward to a great heightjust as hook ha here shewn you by that
prolong of the current in the diagram you mai see thi by take a
light candl and put it in the sun so as to get it shadow thrown
on a piec of paper how remark it is that that thing which is light
enough to produc shadow of other object can be made to throw it own
shadow on a piec of white paper or card so that you can actual see
stream round the flame someth which is not part of the flame but is
ascend and draw the flame upward now i am go to imit the
sunlight by appli the voltaic batteri to the electr lamp you now
see our sun and it great luminos and by place a candl between it
and the screen we get the shadow of the flame
illustr fig 4
you observ the shadow of the candl and of the wick then there is a
darkish part as repres in the diagram and then a part which is more
distinct curious enough howev what we see in the shadow as the
darkest part of the flame is in realiti the brightest part and here you
see stream upward the ascend current of hot air as shewn by
hook which draw out the flame suppli it with air and cool the
side of the cup of melt fuel
i can give you here a littl further illustr for the purpos of
shew you how flame goe up or down accord to the current i have
here a flameit is not a candleflamebut you can no doubt by thi
time generalis enough to be abl to compar on thing with anoth what
i am about to do is to chang the ascend current that take the flame
upward into a descend current thi i can easili do by the littl
apparatu you see befor me the flame as i have said is not a candl
flame but it is produc by alcohol so that it shall not smoke too much
i will also colour the flame with anoth substance6 so that you mai
trace it cours for with the spirit alon you could hardli see well
enough to have the opportun of trace it direct by light thi
spiritofwin we have then a flame produc and you observ that when
held in the air it natur goe upward
illustr fig 5
you understand now easili enough why flame go up under ordinari
circumstancesit is becaus of the draught of air by which the combust
is form but now by blow the flame down you see i am enabl to
make it go downward into thi littl chimneyth direct of the
current be chang befor we have conclud thi cours of lectur
we shall shew you a lamp in which the flame goe up and the smoke goe
down or the flame goe down and the smoke goe up you see then that we
have the power in thi wai of vari the flame in differ direct
there ar now some other point that i must bring befor you mani of the
flame you see here vari veri much in their shape by the current of air
blow around them in differ direct but we can if we like make
flame so that thei will look like fixtur and we can photograph
theminde we have to photograph themso that thei becom fix to us
if we wish to find out everyth concern them that howev is not
the onli thing i wish to mention if i take a flame suffici larg it
doe not keep that homogen that uniform condit of shape but it
break out with a power of life which is quit wonder i am about to
us anoth kind of fuel but on which is truli and fairli a
repres of the wax or tallow of a candl i have here a larg ball
of cotton which will serv as a wick and now that i have immers it in
spirit and appli a light to it in what wai doe it differ from an
ordinari candl why it differ veri much in on respect that we have a
vivac and power about it a beauti and a life entir differ from
the light present by a candl you see those fine tongu of flame
rise up you have the same gener disposit of the mass of the flame
from below upward but in addit to that you have thi remark
break out into tongu which you do not perceiv in the case of a
candl now why is thi i must explain it to you becaus when you
understand that perfectli you will be abl to follow me better in what i
have to sai hereaft i suppos some here will have made for themselv
the experi i am go to shew you am i right in suppos that
anybodi here ha plai at snapdragon i do not know a more beauti
illustr of the philosophi of flame as to a certain part of it
histori than the game of snapdragon first here is the dish and let me
sai that when you plai snapdragon properli you ought to have the dish
wellwarm you ought also to have warm plum and warm brandi which
howev i have not got when you have put the spirit into the dish you
have the cup and the fuel and ar not the raisin act like the wick
i now throw the plum into the dish and light the spirit and you see
those beauti tongu of flame that i refer to you have the air
creep in over the edg of the dish form these tongu why becaus
through the forc of the current and the irregular of the action of the
flame it cannot flow in on uniform stream the air flow in so
irregularli that you have what would otherwis be a singl imag broken
up into a varieti of form and each of these littl tongu ha an
independ exist of it own inde i might sai you have here a
multitud of independ candl you must not imagin becaus you see
these tongu all at onc that the flame is of thi particular shape a
flame of that shape is never so at ani on time never is a bodi of flame
like that which you just saw rise from the ball of the shape it appear
to you it consist of a multitud of differ shape succeed each
other so fast that the ey is onli abl to take cognis of them all at
onc in former time i purpos analys a flame of that gener
charact and the diagram shew you the differ part of which it is
compos thei do not occur all at onc it is onli becaus we see these
shape in such rapid success that thei seem to us to exist all at on
time
illustr fig 6
it is too bad that we have not got further than my game of snapdragon but
we must not under ani circumst keep you beyond your time it will
be a lesson to me in futur to hold you more strictli to the philosophi of
the thing than to take up your time so much with these illustr
lectur ii
a candl bright of the flameair necessari for
combustionproduct of water
we were occupi the last time we met in consid the gener charact
and arrang as regard the fluid portion of a candl and the wai in
which that fluid got into the place of combust you see when we have a
candl burn fairli in a regular steadi atmospher it will have a
shape someth like the on shewn in the diagram and will look pretti
uniform although veri curiou in it charact and now i have to ask
your attent to the mean by which we ar enabl to ascertain what
happen in ani particular part of the flamewhi it happen what it doe
in happen and where after all the whole candl goe to becaus as
you know veri well a candl be brought befor us and burn
disappear if burn properli without the least trace of dirt in the
candlestickand thi is a veri curiou circumst in order then to
examin thi candl carefulli i have arrang certain apparatu the us
of which you will see as i go on here is a candl i am about to put the
end of thi glass tube into the middl of the flameinto that part which
old hook ha repres in the diagram as be rather dark and which
you can see at ani time if you will look at a candl carefulli without
blow it about we will examin thi dark part first
illustr fig 7
now i take thi bent glass tube and introduc on end into that part of
the flame and you see at onc that someth is come from the flame
out at the other end of the tube and if i put a flask there and leav it
for a littl while you will see that someth from the middl part of
the flame is gradual drawn out and goe through the tube and into that
flask and there behav veri differ from what it doe in the open
air it not onli escap from the end of the tube but fall down to the
bottom of the flask like a heavi substanc as inde it is we find that
thi is the wax of the candl made into a vapor fluidnot a ga you
must learn the differ between a ga and a vapour a ga remain
perman a vapour is someth that will condens if you blow out a
candl you perceiv a veri nasti smell result from the condens
of thi vapour that is veri differ from what you have outsid the
flame and in order to make that more clear to you i am about to produc
and set fire to a larger portion of thi vapourfor what we have in the
small wai in a candl to understand thoroughli we must as philosoph
produc in a larger wai if need that we mai examin the differ
part and now mr anderson will give me a sourc of heat and i am about
to shew you what that vapour is here is some wax in a glass flask and i
am go to make it hot as the insid of that candleflam is hot and
the matter about the wick is hot the lectur place some wax in a glass
flask and heat it over a lamp now i dare sai that is hot enough for
me you see that the wax i put in it ha becom fluid and there is a
littl smoke come from it we shall veri soon have the vapour rise up
i will make it still hotter and now we get more of it so that i can
actual pour the vapour out of the flask into that basin and set it on
fire there thi then is exactli the same kind of vapour as we have in
the middl of the candl and that you mai be sure thi is the case let
us try whether we have not got here in thi flask a real combust
vapour out of the middl of the candl take the flask into which the
tube from the candl proceed and introduc a light taper see how
it burn now thi is the vapour from the middl of the candl produc
by it own heat and that is on of the first thing you have to consid
with respect to the progress of the wax in the cours of it combust
and as regard the chang it undergo i will arrang anoth tube
carefulli in the flame and i should not wonder if we were abl by a
littl care to get that vapour to pass through the tube to the other
extrem where we will light it and obtain absolut the flame of the
candl at a place distant from it now look at that is not that a veri
pretti experi talk about lai on gaswhi we can actual lai on a
candl and you see from thi that there ar clearli two differ kind
of actionon the product of the vapour and the other the
combust of itboth of which take place in particular part of the
candl
illustr fig 8
i shall get no vapour from that part which is alreadi burnt if i rais
the tube fig 7 to the upper part of the flame so soon as the vapour
ha been swept out what come awai will be no longer combust it is
alreadi burn how burn why burn thusin the middl of the flame
where the wick is there is thi combust vapour on the outsid of the
flame is the air which we shall find necessari for the burn of the
candl between the two intens chemic action take place wherebi the
air and the fuel act upon each other and at the veri same time that we
obtain light the vapour insid is destroi if you examin where the heat
of a candl is you will find it veri curious arrang suppos i take
thi candl and hold a piec of paper close upon the flame where is the
heat of that flame do you not see that it is not in the insid it is
in a ring exactli in the place where i told you the chemic action wa
and even in my irregular mode of make the experi if there is not
too much disturb there will alwai be a ring thi is a good
experi for you to make at home take a strip of paper have the air in
the room quiet and put the piec of paper right across the middl of the
flame i must not talk while i make the experi and you will find
that it is burnt in two place and that it is not burnt or veri littl
so in the middl and when you have tri the experi onc or twice
so as to make it nice you will be veri interest to see where the heat
is and to find that it is where the air and the fuel come togeth
thi is most import for us as we proce with our subject air is
absolut necessari for combust and what is more i must have you
understand that fresh air is necessari or els we should be imperfect
in our reason and our experi here is a jar of air i place it
over a candl and it burn veri nice in it at first shew that what
i have said about it is true but there will soon be a chang see how the
flame is draw upward present fade and at last go out and
go out why not becaus it want air mere for the jar is as full
now as it wa befor but it want pure fresh air the jar is full of
air partli chang partli not chang but it doe not contain
suffici of the fresh air which is necessari for the combust of a
candl these ar all point which we as young chemist have to gather
up and if we look a littl more close into thi kind of action we
shall find certain step of reason extrem interest for instanc
here is the oillamp i shew youan excel lamp for our
experimentsth old argand lamp i now make it like a candl obstruct
the passag of air into the centr of the flame there is the cotton
there is the oil rise up it and there is the conic flame it burn
poorli becaus there is a partial restraint of air i have allow no air
to get to it save round the outsid of the flame and it doe not burn
well i cannot admit more air from the outsid becaus the wick is larg
but if as argand did so cleverli i open a passag to the middl of the
flame and so let air come in there you will see how much more
beautifulli it burn if i shut the air off look how it smoke and why
we have now some veri interest point to studi we have the case of the
combust of a candl we have the case of a candl be put out by the
want of air and we have now the case of imperfect combust and thi is
to us so interest that i want you to understand it as thoroughli as
you do the case of a candl burn in it best possibl manner i will
now make a great flame becaus we need the largest possibl
illustr here is a larger wick burn turpentin on a ball of
cotton all these thing ar the same as candl after all if we have
larger wick we must have a larger suppli of air or we shall have less
perfect combust look now at thi black substanc go up into the
atmospher there is a regular stream of it i have provid mean to
carri off the imperfectli burn part lest it should annoi you look at
the soot that fly off from the flame see what an imperfect combust it
is becaus it cannot get enough air what then is happen why
certain thing which ar necessari to the combust of a candl ar
absent and veri bad result ar accordingli produc but we see what
happen to a candl when it is burnt in a pure and proper state of air at
the time when i shew you thi char by the ring of flame on the on
side of the paper i might have also shewn you by turn to the other
side that the burn of a candl produc the same kind of
sootcharco or carbon
but befor i shew that let me explain to youa it is quit necessari
for our purposethat though i take a candl and give you as the gener
result it combust in the form of a flame we must see whether
combust is alwai in thi condit or whether there ar other
condit of flame and we shall soon discov that there ar and that
thei ar most import to us i think perhap the best illustr of
such a point to us as juvenil is to shew the result of strong
contrast here is a littl gunpowd you know that gunpowd burn with
flamew mai fairli call it flame it contain carbon and other
materi which altogeth caus it to burn with a flame and here is
some pulveris iron or iron file now i purpos burn these two
thing togeth i have a littl mortar in which i will mix them befor
i go into these experi let me hope that none of you by try to
repeat them for fun sake will do ani harm these thing mai all be
veri properli us if you take care but without that much mischief will
be done well then here is a littl gunpowd which i put at the
bottom of that littl wooden vessel and mix the iron file up with it
my object be to make the gunpowd set fire to the file and burn
them in the air and therebi shew the differ between substanc
burn with flame and not with flame here is the mixtur and when i set
fire to it you must watch the combust and you will see that it is of
two kind you will see the gunpowd burn with a flame and the
file thrown up you will see them burn too but without the
product of flame thei will each burn separ the lectur then
ignit the mixtur there is the gunpowd which burn with a flame
and there ar the filingsthei burn with a differ kind of combust
you see then these two great distinct and upon these differ
depend all the util and all the beauti of flame which we us for the
purpos of give out light when we us oil or ga or candl for the
purpos of illumin their fit all depend upon these differ
kind of combust
there ar such curiou condit of flame that it requir some
clever and niceti of discrimin to distinguish the kind of
combust on from anoth for instanc here is a powder which is veri
combust consist as you see of separ littl particl it is
call lycopodium7 and each of these particl can produc a vapour
and produc it own flame but to see them burn you would imagin it
wa all on flame i will now set fire to a quantiti and you will see the
effect we saw a cloud of flame appar in on bodi but that rush
nois refer to the sound produc by the burn wa a proof that
the combust wa not a continu or regular on thi is the lightn
of the pantomim and a veri good imit the experi wa twice
repeat by blow lycopodium from a glass tube through a spiritflam
thi is not an exampl of combust like that of the file i have been
speak of to which we must now return
suppos i take a candl and examin that part of it which appear
brightest to our ey why there i get these black particl which
alreadi you have seen mani time evolv from the flame and which i am
now about to evolv in a differ wai i will take thi candl and clear
awai the gutterag which occur by reason of the current of air and if
i now arrang a glass tube so as just to dip into thi lumin part as
in our first experi onli higher you see the result in place of
have the same white vapour that you had befor you will now have a
black vapour there it goe as black as ink it is certainli veri
differ from the white vapour and when we put a light to it we shall
find that it doe not burn but that it put the light out well these
particl as i said befor ar just the smoke of the candl and thi
bring to mind that old employ which dean swift recommend to
servant for their amus name write on the ceil of a room
with a candl but what is that black substanc why it is the same
carbon which exist in the candl how come it out of the candl it
evid exist in the candl or els we should not have had it here
and now i want you to follow me in thi explan you would hardli
think that all those substanc which fly about london in the form of
soot and black ar the veri beauti and life of the flame and which ar
burn in it as those iron file were burn here here is a piec of
wire gauz which will not let the flame go through it and i think you
will see almost immedi that when i bring it low enough to touch
that part of the flame which is otherwis so bright that it quell and
quench it at onc and allow a volum of smoke to rise up
i want you now to follow me in thi pointthat whenev a substanc
burn as the iron file burnt in the flame of gunpowd without
assum the vapor state whether it becom liquid or remain solid
it becom exceedingli lumin i have here taken three or four exampl
apart from the candl on purpos to illustr thi point to you becaus
what i have to sai is applic to all substanc whether thei burn or
whether thei do not burnthat thei ar exceedingli bright if thei retain
their solid state and that it is to thi presenc of solid particl in
the candleflam that it ow it brillianc
here is a platinumwir a bodi which doe not chang by heat if i heat
it in thi flame see how exceedingli lumin it becom i will make the
flame dim for the purpos of give a littl light onli and yet you will
see that the heat which it can give to that platinumwir though far less
than the heat it ha itself is abl to rais the platinumwir to a far
higher state of effulg thi flame ha carbon in it but i will take
on that ha no carbon in it there is a materi a kind of fuela
vapour or ga whichev you like to call itin that vessel and it ha
no solid particl in it so i take that becaus it is an exampl of flame
itself burn without ani solid matter whatev and if i now put thi
solid substanc in it you see what an intens heat it ha and how
brightli it caus the solid bodi to glow thi is the pipe through which
we convei thi particular ga which we call hydrogen and which you shall
know all about next time we meet and here is a substanc call oxygen
by mean of which thi hydrogen can burn and although we produc by
their mixtur far greater heat8 than you can obtain from the candl
yet there is veri littl light if howev i take a solid substanc and
put that into it we produc an intens light if i take a piec of lime a
substanc which will not burn and which will not vaporis by the heat
and becaus it doe not vaporis remain solid and remain heat you
will soon observ what happen as to it glow i have here a most
intens heat produc by the burn of hydrogen in contact with the
oxygen but there is as yet veri littl lightnot for want of heat but
for want of particl which can retain their solid state but when i hold
thi piec of lime in the flame of the hydrogen as it burn in the oxygen
see how it glow thi is the gloriou limelight which rival the
voltaiclight and which is almost equal to sunlight i have here a piec
of carbon or charcoal which will burn and give us light exactli in the
same manner as if it were burnt as part of a candl the heat that is in
the flame of a candl decompos the vapour of the wax and set free the
carbon particlesthei rise up heat and glow as thi now glow and
then enter into the air but the particl when burnt never pass off from
a candl in the form of carbon thei go off into the air as a perfectli
invis substanc about which we shall know hereaft
is it not beauti to think that such a process is go on and that
such a dirti thing as charcoal can becom so incandesc you see it
come to thisthat all bright flame contain these solid particl all
thing that burn and produc solid particl either dure the time thei
ar burn as in the candl or immedi after be burnt as in the
case of the gunpowd and ironfilingsal these thing give us thi
gloriou and beauti light
i will give you a few illustr here is a piec of phosphoru which
burn with a bright flame veri well we mai now conclud that phosphoru
will produc either at the moment that it is burn or afterward these
solid particl here is the phosphoru light and i cover it over with
thi glass for the purpos of keep in what is produc what is all
that smoke that smoke consist of those veri particl which ar produc
by the combust of the phosphoru here again ar two substanc thi
is chlorat of potassa and thi other sulphuret of antimoni i shall mix
these togeth a littl and then thei mai be burnt in mani wai i shall
touch them with a drop of sulphur acid for the purpos of give you an
illustr of chemic action and thei will instantli burn9 the
lectur then ignit the mixtur by mean of sulphur acid now from
the appear of thing you can judg for yourselv whether thei
produc solid matter in burn i have given you the train of reason
which will enabl you to sai whether thei do or do not for what is thi
bright flame but the solid particl pass off
illustr fig 9
mr anderson ha in the furnac a veri hot cruciblei am about to throw
into it some zinc file and thei will burn with a flame like gunpowd
i make thi experi becaus you can make it well at home now i want
you to see what will be the result of the combust of thi zinc here it
is burningburn beautifulli like a candl i mai sai but what is all
that smoke and what ar those littl cloud of wool which will come to
you if you cannot come to them and make themselv sensibl to you in the
form of the old philosoph wool as it wa call we shall have left in
that crucibl also a quantiti of thi woolli matter but i will take a
piec of thi same zinc and make an experi a littl more close at
home as it were you will have here the same thing happen here is the
piec of zinc there point to a jet of hydrogen is the furnac and
we will set to work and try and burn the metal it glow you see there
is the combust and there is the white substanc into which it burn
and so if i take that flame of hydrogen as the repres of a
candl and shew you a substanc like zinc burn in the flame you will
see that it wa mere dure the action of combust that thi substanc
glowedwhil it wa kept hot and if i take a flame of hydrogen and put
thi white substanc from the zinc into it look how beautifulli it glow
and just becaus it is a solid substanc
i will now take such a flame as i had a moment sinc and set free from it
the particl of carbon here is some camphin which will burn with a
smoke but if i send these particl of smoke through thi pipe into the
hydrogen flame you will see thei will burn and becom lumin becaus
we heat them a second time there thei ar those ar the particl of
carbon reignit a second time thei ar those particl which you can
easili see by hold a piec of paper behind them and which whilst thei
ar in the flame ar ignit by the heat produc and when so ignit
produc thi bright when the particl ar not separ you get no
bright the flame of coalga ow it bright to the separ
dure combust of these particl of carbon which ar equal in that
as in a candl i can veri quickli alter that arrang here for
instanc is a bright flame of ga suppos i add so much air to the
flame as to caus it all to burn befor those particl ar set free i
shall not have thi bright and i can do that in thi wayif i place
over the jet thi wiregauz cap as you see and then light the ga over
it it burn with a nonlumin flame ow to it have plenti of air
mix with it befor it burn and if i rais the gauz you see it doe
not burn below10 there is plenti of carbon in the ga but becaus the
atmospher can get to it and mix with it befor it burn you see how
pale and blue the flame is and if i blow upon a bright gasflam so as
to consum all thi carbon befor it get heat to the glow point it
will also burn blue the lectur illustr hi remark by blow on
the gaslight the onli reason why i have not the same bright light when
i thu blow upon the flame is that the carbon meet with suffici air
to burn it befor it get separ in the flame in a free state the
differ is sole due to the solid particl not be separ befor
the ga is burnt
you observ that there ar certain product as the result of the
combust of a candl and that of these product on portion mai be
consid as charcoal or soot that charcoal when afterward burnt
produc some other product and it concern us veri much now to ascertain
what that other product is we shew that someth wa go awai and i
want you now to understand how much is go up into the air and for that
purpos we will have combust on a littl larger scale from that candl
ascend heat air and two or three experi will shew you the
ascend current but in order to give you a notion of the quantiti of
matter which ascend in thi wai i will make an experi by which i
shall try to imprison some of the product of thi combust for thi
purpos i have here what boi call a fireballoon i us thi fireballoon
mere as a sort of measur of the result of the combust we ar
consid and i am about to make a flame in such an easi and simpl
manner as shall best serv my present purpos thi plate shall be the
cup we will so sai of the candl thi spirit shall be our fuel and i
am about to place thi chimnei over it becaus it is better for me to do
so than to let thing proce at random
illustr fig 10
mr anderson will now light the fuel and here at the top we shall get the
result of the combust what we get at the top of that tube is exactli
the same gener speak as you get from the combust of a candl
but we do not get a lumin flame here becaus we us a substanc which
is feebl in carbon i am about to put thi balloonnot into action
becaus that is not my objectbut to shew you the effect which result
from the action of those product which aris from the candl as thei
aris here from the furnac the balloon wa held over the chimnei when
it immedi commenc to fill you see how it is dispos to ascend
but we must not let it up becaus it might come in contact with those
upper gaslight and that would be veri inconveni the upper
gaslight were turn out at the request of the lectur and the
balloon wa allow to ascend doe not that shew you what a larg bulk
of matter is be evolv now there is go through thi tube place
a larg glass tube over a candl all the product of that candl and you
will present see that the tube will becom quit opaqu suppos i take
anoth candl and place it under a jar and then put a light on the
other side just to shew you what is go on you see that the side of
the jar becom cloudi and the light begin to burn feebli it is the
product you see which make the light so dim and thi is the same thing
which make the side of the jar so opaqu if you go home and take a
spoon that ha been in the cold air and hold it over a candlenot so as
to soot ityou will find that it becom dim just as that jar is dim if
you can get a silver dish or someth of that kind you will make the
experi still better and now just to carri your thought forward to
the time we shall next meet let me tell you that it is water which
caus the dim and when we next meet i will shew you that we can
make it without difficulti assum the form of a liquid
lectur iii
product water from the combustionnatur of watera
compoundhydrogen
i dare sai you will rememb that when we part we had just mention the
word product from the candl for when a candl burn we found we were
abl by nice adjust to get variou product from it there wa on
substanc which wa not obtain when the candl wa burn properli
which wa charcoal or smoke and there wa some other substanc that went
upward from the flame which did not appear as smoke but took some other
form and made part of that gener current which ascend from the
candl upward becom invis and escap there were also other
product to mention you rememb that in that rise current have it
origin at the candl we found that on part wa condens against a
cold spoon or against a clean plate or ani other cold thing and anoth
part wa incondens
we will first take the condens part and examin it and strang to
sai we find that that part of the product is just waternoth but
water on the last occas i spoke of it incident mere sai that
water wa produc among the condens product of the candl but
todai i wish to draw your attent to water that we mai examin it
carefulli especi in relat to thi subject and also with respect
to it gener exist on the surfac of the globe
now have previous arrang an experi for the purpos of
condens water from the product of the candl my next point will be to
shew you thi water and perhap on of the best mean that i can adopt
for shew it presenc to so mani at onc is to exhibit a veri visibl
action of water and then to appli that test to what is collect as a
drop at the bottom of that vessel i have here a chemic substanc
discov by sir humphrei davi which ha a veri energet action upon
water which i shall us as a test of the presenc of water if i take a
littl piec of itit is call potassium as come from potashif i
take a littl piec of it and throw it into that basin you see how it
shew the presenc of water by light up and float about burn
with a violent flame i am now go to take awai the candl which ha
been burn beneath the vessel contain ic and salt and you see a
drop of watera condens product of the candlehang from under the
surfac of the dish
illustr fig 11
i will shew you that potassium ha the same action upon it as upon the
water in that basin in the experi we have just tri see it take
fire and burn in just the same manner i will take anoth drop upon
thi glass slab and when i put the potassium on to it you see at onc
from it take fire that there is water present now that water wa
produc by the candl in the same manner if i put thi spiritlamp
under that jar you will soon see the latter becom damp from the dew
which is deposit upon itthat dew be the result of combust and i
have no doubt you will shortli see by the drop of water which fall upon
the paper below that there is a good deal of water produc from the
combust of the lamp i will let it remain and you can afterward see
how much water ha been collect so if i take a gaslamp and put ani
cool arrang over it i shall get waterwat be likewis
produc from the combust of ga here in thi bottl is a quantiti
of waterperfectli pure distil water produc from the combust of
a gaslampin no point differ from the water that you distil from the
river or ocean or spring but exactli the same thing water is on
individu thingit never chang we can add to it by care
adjust for a littl while or we can take it apart and get other
thing from it but water as water remain alwai the same either in a
solid liquid or fluid state here again hold anoth bottl is
some water produc by the combust of an oillamp a pint of oil when
burnt fairli and properli produc rather more than a pint of water
here again is some water produc by a rather long experi from a
wax candl and so we can go on with almost all combust substanc
and find that if thei burn with a flame as a candl thei produc water
you mai make these experi yourselv the head of a poker is a veri
good thing to try with and if it remain cold long enough over the
candl you mai get water condens in drop on it or a spoon or ladl
or anyth els mai be us provid it be clean and can carri off the
heat and so condens the water
and nowto go into the histori of thi wonder product of water from
combust and by combustioni must first of all tell you that thi
water mai exist in differ condit and although you mai now be
acquaint with all it form thei still requir us to give a littl
attent to them for the present so that we mai perceiv how the water
whilst it goe through it protean chang is entir and absolut the
same thing whether it is produc from a candl by combust or from
the river or ocean
first of all water when at the coldest is ic now we philosophersi
hope that i mai class you and myself togeth in thi casespeak of water
as water whether it be in it solid or liquid or gaseou statew
speak of it chemic as water water is a thing compound of two
substanc on of which we have deriv from the candl and the other we
shall find elsewher water mai occur as ic and you have had most
excel opportun late of see thi ic chang back into
waterfor we had on our last sabbath a strong instanc of thi chang by
the sad catastroph which occur in our own hous as well as in the
hous of mani of our friendsic chang back into water when the
temperatur is rais water also chang into steam when it is warm
enough the water which we have here befor us is in it densest
state11 and although it chang in weight in condit in form and
in mani other qualiti it still is water and whether we alter it into
ic by cool or whether we chang it into steam by heat it increas
in volumein the on case veri strang and powerfulli and in the
other case veri larg and wonderfulli for instanc i will now take
thi tin cylind and pour a littl water into it and see how much
water i pour in you mai easili estim for yourselv how high it will
rise in the vessel it will cover the bottom about two inch i am now
about to convert the water into steam for the purpos of shew to you
the differ volum which water occupi in it differ state of
water and steam
let us now take the case of water chang into ic we can effect that by
cool it in a mixtur of salt and pound ice12 and i shall do so to
shew you the expans of water into a thing of larger bulk when it is so
chang these bottl hold on ar made of strong cast iron veri
strong and veri thicki suppos thei ar the third of an inch in
thick thei ar veri carefulli fill with water so as to exclud all
air and then thei ar screw down tight we shall see that when we
freez the water in these iron vessel thei will not be abl to hold the
ic and the expans within them will break them in piec as these
point to some fragment ar broken which have been bottl of
exactli the same kind i am about to put these two bottl into that
mixtur of ic and salt for the purpos of shew that when water
becom ic it chang in volum in thi extraordinari wai
in the mean time look at the chang which ha taken place in the water to
which we have appli heatit is lose it fluid state you mai tell
thi by two or three circumst i have cover the mouth of thi glass
flask in which water is boil with a watchglass do you see what
happen it rattl awai like a valv chatter becaus the steam rise
from the boil water send the valv up and down and forc itself out
and so make it clatter you can veri easili perceiv that the flask is
quit full of steam or els it would not forc it wai out you see
also that the flask contain a substanc veri much larger than the water
for it fill the whole of the flask over and over again and there it is
blow awai into the air and yet you cannot observ ani great diminut
in the bulk of the water which shew you that it chang of bulk is veri
great when it becom steam
i have put our iron bottl contain water into thi freez mixtur
that you mai see what happen no commun will take place you
observ between the water in the bottl and the ic in the outer vessel
but there will be a convey of heat from the on to the other and if
we ar successfulw ar make our experi in veri great hastei
expect you will byandbi so soon as the cold ha taken possess of the
bottl and their content hear a pop on the occas of the burst of
the on bottl or the other and when we come to examin the bottl we
shall find their content mass of ic partli enclos by the cover
of iron which is too small for them becaus the ic is larger in bulk
than the water you know veri well that ic float upon water if a boi
fall through a hole into the water he tri to get on the ic again to
float him up why doe the ic floatthink of that and philosophis
becaus the ic is larger than the quantiti of water which can produc it
and therefor the ic weigh the lighter and the water is the heavier
to return now to the action of heat on water see what a stream of vapour
is issu from thi tin vessel you observ we must have made it quit
full of steam to have it sent out in that great quantiti and now as we
can convert the water into steam by heat we convert it back into liquid
water by the applic of cold and if we take a glass or ani other
cold thing and hold it over thi steam see how soon it get damp with
water it will condens it until the glass is warmit condens the water
which is now run down the side of it i have here anoth experi
to shew the condens of water from a vapor state back into a liquid
state in the same wai as the vapour on of the product of the candl
wa condens against the bottom of the dish and obtain in the form of
water and to shew you how truli and thoroughli these chang take place
i will take thi tin flask which is now full of steam and close the top
we shall see what take place when we caus thi water or steam to return
back to the fluid state by pour some cold water on the outsid the
lectur pour the cold water over the vessel when it immedi
collaps you see what ha happen if i had close the stopper and
still kept the heat appli to it it would have burst the vessel yet
when the steam return to the state of water the vessel collaps there
be a vacuum produc insid by the condens of the steam i shew
you these experi for the purpos of point out that in all these
occurr there is noth that chang the water into ani other
thingit still remain water and so the vessel is oblig to give wai
and is crush inward as in the other case by the further applic
of heat it would have been blown outward
illustr fig 12
and what do you think the bulk of that water is when it assum the
vapor condit you see that cube point to a cubic foot there
by it side is a cubic inch exactli the same shape as the cubic foot
and that bulk of water the cubic inch is suffici to expand into that
bulk the cubic foot of steam and on the contrari the applic of
cold will contract that larg quantiti of steam into thi small quantiti
of water
illustr fig 13
on of the iron bottl burst at that moment ah there is on of our
bottl burst and here you see is a crack down on side an eighth of an
inch in width the other now explod send the freez mixtur in
all direct thi other bottl is also broken although the iron wa
nearli halfaninch thick the ic ha burst it asund these chang
alwai take place in water thei do not requir to be alwai produc by
artifici meansw onli us them here becaus we want to produc a
small winter round that littl bottl instead of a long and sever on
but if you go to canada or to the north you will find the temperatur
there out of door will do the same thing as ha been done here by the
freez mixtur
to return to our quiet philosophi we shall not in futur be deceiv
therefor by ani chang that ar produc in water water is the same
everywher whether produc from the ocean or from the flame of the
candl where then is thi water which we get from a candl i must
anticip a littl and tell you it evid come as to part of it
from the candl but is it within the candl beforehand no it is not in
the candl and it is not in the air round about the candl which is
necessari for it combust it is neither in on nor the other but it
come from their conjoint action a part from the candl a part from the
air and thi we have now to trace so that we mai understand thoroughli
what is the chemic histori of a candl when we have it burn on our
tabl how shall we get at thi i myself know plenti of wai but i want
you to get at it from the associ in your own mind of what i have
alreadi told you
i think you can see a littl in thi wai we had just now the case of a
substanc which act upon the water in the wai that sir humphrei davi
shew us13 and which i am now go to recal to your mind by make
again an experi upon that dish it is a thing which we have to handl
veri carefulli for you see if i allow a littl splash of water to come
upon thi mass it set fire to part of it and if there were free access
of air it would quickli set fire to the whole now thi is a metala
beauti and bright metalwhich rapidli chang in the air and as you
know rapidli chang in water i will put a piec on the water and you
see it burn beautifulli make a float lamp us the water in the
place of air again if we take a few iron file or turn and put
them in water we find that thei likewis undergo an alter thei do
not chang so much as thi potassium doe but thei chang somewhat in the
same wai thei becom rusti and shew an action upon the water though in
a differ degre of intens to what thi beauti metal doe but
thei act upon the water in the same manner gener as thi potassium i
want you to put these differ fact togeth in your mind i have
anoth metal here zinc and when we examin it with regard to the
solid substanc produc by it combust we had an opportun of
see that it burn and i suppos if i take a littl strip of thi
zinc and put it over the candl you will see someth halfwai as it
were between the combust of potassium on the water and the action of
irony see there is a sort of combust it ha burn leav a
white ash or residuum and here also we find that the metal ha a certain
amount of action upon water
by degre we have learn how to modifi the action of these differ
substanc and to make them tell us what we want to know and now first
of all i take iron it is a common thing in all chemic reaction where
we get ani result of thi kind to find that it is increas by the action
of heat and if we want to examin minut and carefulli the action of
bodi on upon anoth we often have to refer to the action of heat you
ar awar i believ that ironfil burn beautifulli in the air but i
am about to shew you an experi of thi kind becaus it will impress
upon you what i am go to sai about iron in it action on water if i
take a flame and make it hollowy know why becaus i want to get air
to it and into it and therefor i make it hollowand then take a few
ironfil and drop them into the flame you see how well thei burn
that combust result from the chemic action which is go on when we
ignit those particl and so we proce to consid these differ
effect and ascertain what iron will do when it meet with water it will
tell us the stori so beautifulli so gradual and regularli that i think
it will pleas you veri much
i have here a furnac with a pipe go through it like an iron
gun barrel and i have stuf that barrel full of bright ironturn
and place it across the fire to be made redhot we can either send air
through the barrel to come in contact with the iron or we can send steam
from thi littl boiler at the end of the barrel here is a stopcock
which shut off the steam from the barrel until we wish to admit it there
is some water in these glass jar which i have colour blue so that you
mai see what happen now you know veri well that ani steam i might send
through that barrel if it went through into the water would be
condens for you have seen that steam cannot retain it gaseou form if
it be cool down
illustr fig 14
you saw it here point to the tin flask crush itself into a small
bulk and caus the flask hold it to collaps so that if i were to
send steam through that barrel it would be condensedsuppos the
barrel were cold it is therefor heat to perform the experi i am
now about to shew you i am go to send the steam through the barrel in
small quantiti and you shall judg for yourselv when you see it
issu from the other end whether it still remain steam steam is
condens into water and when you lower the temperatur of steam you
convert it back into fluid water but i have lower the temperatur of
the ga which i have collect in thi jar by pass it through water
after it ha travers the iron barrel and still it doe not chang back
into water i will take anoth test and appli to thi ga i hold the
jar in an invert posit or my substanc would escap if i now appli
a light to the mouth of the jar it ignit with a slight nois that
tell you that it is not steam steam put out a fireit doe not burn
but you saw that what i had in that jar burnt we mai obtain thi
substanc equal from water produc from the candleflam as from ani
other sourc when it is obtain by the action of the iron upon the
aqueou vapour it leav the iron in a state veri similar to that in
which these file were after thei were burnt it make the iron heavier
than it wa befor so long as the iron remain in the tube and is heat
and is cool again without the access of air or water it doe not chang
in it weight but after have had thi current of steam pass over it
it then come out heavier that it wa befor have taken someth out
of the steam and have allow someth els to pass forth which we
see here and now as we have anoth jar full i will shew you someth
most interest it is a combust ga and i might at onc take thi
jar and set fire to the content and shew you that it is combust but
i intend to shew you more if i can it is also a veri light substanc
steam will condens thi bodi will rise in the air and not condens
illustr fig 15
suppos i take anoth glass jar empti of all but air if i examin it
with a taper i shall find that it contain noth but air i will now
take thi jar full of the ga that i am speak of and deal with it as
though it were a light bodi i will hold both upsidedown and turn the
on up under the other and that which did contain the ga procur from
the steam what doe it contain now you will find it now onli contain
air but look here is the combust substanc take the other jar
which i have pour out of the on jar into the other it still preserv
it qualiti and condit and independ and therefor is the more
worthi of our consider as belong to the product of a candl
now thi substanc which we have just prepar by the action of iron on
the steam or water we can also get by mean of those other thing which
you have alreadi seen act so well upon the water if i take a piec of
potassium and make the necessari arrang it will produc thi ga
and if instead a piec of zinc i find when i come to examin it veri
carefulli that the main reason why thi zinc cannot act upon the water
continu as the other metal doe is becaus the result of the action
of the water envelop the zinc in a kind of protect coat we have
learn in consequ that if we put into our vessel onli the zinc and
water thei by themselv do not give rise to much action and we get no
result but suppos i proce to dissolv off thi varnishthi
encumb substancewhich i can do by a littl acid the moment i do
thi i find the zinc act upon the water exactli as the iron did but
at the common temperatur the acid in no wai is alter except in it
combin with the oxid of zinc which is produc i have now pour
the acid into the glass and the effect is as though i were appli heat
to caus thi boil up there is someth come off from the zinc veri
abundantli which is not steam there is a jar full of it and you will
find that i have exactli the same combust substanc remain in the
vessel when i hold it upsidedown that i produc dure the experi
with the iron barrel thi is what we get from waterth same substanc
which is contain in the candl
illustr fig 16
let us now trace distinctli the connect between these two point thi
is hydrogena bodi class among those thing which in chemistri we call
element becaus we can get noth els out of them a candl is not an
elementari bodi becaus we can get carbon out of it we can get thi
hydrogen out of it or at least out of the water which it suppli and
thi ga ha been so name hydrogen becaus it is that element which in
associ with anoth gener water footnot greek hudo
water and greek gennao i gener mr anderson have now been
abl to get two or three jar of ga we shall have a few experi to
make and i want to shew you the best wai of make these experi i
am not afraid to shew you for i wish you to make experi if you will
onli make them with care and attent and the assent of those around
you as we advanc in chemistri we ar oblig to deal with substanc
which ar rather injuri if in their wrong placesth acid and heat
and combust thing we us might do harm if carelessli emploi if
you want to make hydrogen you can make it easili from bit of zinc and
sulphur or muriat acid here is what in former time wa call the
philosoph candl it is a littl phial with a cork and a tube or
pipe pass through it
illustr fig 17
and i am now put a few littl piec of zinc into it thi littl
instrument i am go to appli to a us purpos in our
demonstrationsfor i want to shew you that you can prepar hydrogen and
make some experi with it as you pleas at your own home let me here
tell you why i am so care to fill thi phial nearli and yet not quit
full i do it becaus the evolv ga which as you have seen is veri
combust is explos to a consider extent when mix with air
and might lead to harm if you were to appli a light to the end of that
pipe befor all the air had been swept out of the space abov the water i
am now about to pour in the sulphur acid i have us veri littl zinc
and more sulphur acid and water becaus i want to keep it at work for
some time i therefor take care in thi wai to modifi the proport of
the ingredi so that i mai have a regular supplynot too quick and
not too slow suppos i now take a glass and put it upsidedown over the
end of the tube becaus the hydrogen is light i expect that it will
remain in that vessel a littl while we will now test the content of our
glass to see if there be hydrogen in it i think i am safe in sai we
have caught some appli a light there it is you see i will now
appli a light to the top of the tube there is the hydrogen burn there
is our philosoph candl it is a foolish feebl sort of a flame you
mai sai but it is so hot that scarc ani common flame give out so much
heat it goe on burn regularli and i am now about to put that flame
to burn under a certain arrang in order that we mai examin it
result and make us of the inform which we mai therebi acquir
inasmuch as the candl produc water and thi ga come out of the
water let us see what thi give us by the same process of combust
that the candl went through when it burnt in the atmospher and for that
purpos i am go to put the lamp under thi apparatu in order to
condens whatev mai aris from the combust within it in the cours of
a short time you will see moistur appear in the cylind and you will
get the water run down the side and the water from thi hydrogen
flame will have absolut the same effect upon all our test be
obtain by the same gener process as in the former case thi hydrogen
is a veri beauti substanc it is so light that it carri thing up
it is far lighter than the atmospher and i dare sai i can shew you thi
by an experi which if you ar veri clever some of you mai even have
skill enough to repeat here is our gener of hydrogen and here ar
some soapsud i have an indiarubb tube connect with the hydrogen
gener and at the end of the tube is a tobaccopip
illustr fig 18
i can thu put the pipe into the sud and blow bubbl by mean of the
hydrogen you observ how the bubbl fall downward when i blow them with
my warm breath but notic the differ when i blow them with hydrogen
the lectur here blew bubbl with hydrogen which rose to the roof of
the theatr it shew you how light thi ga must be in order to carri
with it not mere the ordinari soapbubbl but the larger portion of a
drop hang to the bottom of it i can shew it light in a better wai
than thi larger bubbl than these mai be so lift up inde in
former time balloon us to be fill with thi ga mr anderson will
fasten thi tube on to our gener and we shall have a stream of
hydrogen here with which we can charg thi balloon made of collodion i
need not even be veri care to get all the air out for i know the power
of thi ga to carri it up two collodion balloon were inflat and
sent up on be held by a string here is anoth larger on made of
thin membran which we will fill and allow to ascend you will see thei
will all remain float about until the ga escap
what then ar the compar weight of these substanc i have a
tabl here which will shew you the proport which their weight bear to
each other i have taken a pint and a cubic foot as the measur and have
place opposit to them the respect figur a pint measur of thi
hydrogen weigh threequart of our smallest weight a grain and a
cubic foot weigh onetwelfth of an ounc wherea a pint of water weigh
8750 grain and a cubic foot of water weigh almost 1000 ounc you
see therefor what a vast differ there is between the weight of a
cubic foot of water and a cubic foot of hydrogen
hydrogen give rise to no substanc that can becom solid either dure
combust or afterward as a product of it combust but when it
burn it produc water onli and if we take a cold glass and put it over
the flame it becom damp and you have water produc immedi in
appreci quantiti and noth is produc by it combust but the
same water which you have seen the flame of the candl produc it is
import to rememb that thi hydrogen is the onli thing in natur which
furnish water as the sole product of combust
and now we must endeavour to find some addit proof of the gener
charact and composit of water and for thi purpos i will keep you a
littl longer so that at our next meet we mai be better prepar for
the subject we have the power of arrang the zinc which you have seen
act upon the water by the assist of an acid in such a manner as to
caus all the power to be evolv in the place where we requir it i have
behind me a voltaic pile and i am just about to shew you at the end of
thi lectur it charact and power that you mai see what we shall have
to deal with when next we meet i hold here the extrem of the wire
which transport the power from behind me and which i shall caus to act
on the water
we have previous seen what a power of combust is possess by the
potassium or the zinc or the ironfil but none of them shew such
energi as thi the lectur here made contact between the two termin
wire of the batteri when a brilliant flash of light wa produc thi
light is in fact produc by a fortyzinc power of burn it is a
power that i can carri about in my hand through these wire at
pleasurealthough if i appli it wrongli to myself it would destroi me
in an instant for it is a most intens thing and the power you see here
put forth while you count five bring the pole in contact and
exhibit the electr light is equival to the power of sever
thunderstorm so great is it force14 and that you mai see what
intens energi it ha i will take the end of the wire which convei the
power from the batteri and with it i dare sai i can burn thi iron file
now thi is a chemic power and on which when we next meet i shall
appli to water and shew you what result we ar abl to produc
lectur iv
hydrogen in the candleburn into waterth other part of wateroxygen
i see you ar not tire of the candl yet or i am sure you would not be
interest in the subject in the wai you ar when our candl wa burn
we found it produc water exactli like the water we have around us and
by further examin of thi water we found in it that curiou bodi
hydrogenthat light substanc of which there is some in thi jar we
afterward saw the burn power of that hydrogen and that it produc
water and i think i introduc to your notic an apparatu which i veri
briefli said wa an arrang of chemic forc or power or energi so
adjust as to convei it power to us in these wire and i said i should
us that forc to pull the water to piec to see what els there wa in
the water besid hydrogen becaus you rememb when we pass the
water through the iron tube we by no mean got the weight of water back
which we put in in the form of steam though we had a veri larg quantiti
of ga evolv we have now to see what is the other substanc present
that you mai understand the charact and us of thi instrument let us
make an experi or two let us put togeth first of all some
substanc know what thei ar and then see what that instrument doe
to them there is some copper observ the variou chang which it can
undergo and here is some nitric acid and you will find that thi be
a strong chemic agent will act veri powerfulli when i add it to the
copper it is now send forth a beauti red vapour but as we do not
want that vapour mr anderson will hold it near the chimnei for a short
time that we mai have the us and beauti of the experi without the
annoy the copper which i have put into the flask will dissolv it
will chang the acid and the water into a blue fluid contain copper
and other thing and i propos then shew you how thi voltaic batteri
deal with it and in the mean time we will arrang anoth kind of
experi for you to see what power it ha thi is a substanc which is
to us like waterthat is to sai it contain bodi which we do not know
of as yet as water contain a bodi which we do not know as yet now thi
solut of a salt15 i will put upon paper and spread about and appli
the power of the batteri to it and observ what will happen three or
four import thing will happen which we shall take advantag of i
place thi wet paper upon a sheet of tinfoil which is conveni for
keep all clean and also for the advantag applic of the power
and thi solut you see is not at all affect by be put upon the
paper or tinfoil nor by anyth els i have brought in contact with it
yet and which therefor is free to us to us as regard that
instrument but first let us see that our instrument is in order here ar
our wire let us see whether it is in the state in which it wa last
time we can soon tell as yet when i bring them togeth we have no
power becaus the conveyerswhat we call the electrodesth passag or
wai for the electricityar stop but now mr anderson by that
refer to a sudden flash at the end of the wire ha given me a
telegram to sai that it is readi befor i begin our experi i will get
mr anderson to break contact again at the batteri behind me and we will
put a platinumwir across to connect the pole and then if i find i can
ignit a pretti good length of thi wire we shall be safe in our
experi now you will see the power the connect wa establish
and the intermedi wire becam redhot there is the power run
beautifulli through the wire which i have made thin on purpos to shew
you that we have those power forc and now have that power we
will proce with it to the examin of water
i have here two piec of platinum and if i lai them down upon thi piec
of paper the moisten paper on the tinfoil you will see no action and
if i take them up there is no chang that you can see but the
arrang remain just as it wa befor but now see what happen if
i take these two pole and put either on or the other of them down
separ on the platinumpl thei do noth for me both ar
perfectli without action but if i let them both be in contact at the same
moment see what happen a brown spot appear under each pole of the
batteri look here at the effect that take place and see how i have
pull someth apart from the whitesometh brown and i have no
doubt if i were to arrang it thu and were to put on of the pole to
the tinfoil on the other side of the paperwhi i get such a beauti
action upon the paper that i am go to see whether i cannot write with
ita telegram if you pleas the lectur here trace the word
juvenil on the paper with on of the termin wire see there how
beautifulli we can get our result
you see we have here drawn someth which we have not known about
befor out of thi solut let us now take that flask from mr
andersen hand and see what we can draw out of that thi you know is
a liquid which we have just made up from copper and nitric acid whilst
our other experi were in hand and though i am make thi experi
veri hastili and mai bungl a littl yet i prefer to let you see what i
do rather than prepar it beforehand
now see what happen these two platinumpl ar the two end or i
will make them so immedi of thi apparatu and i am about to put
them in contact with that solut just as we did a moment ago on the
paper it doe not matter to us whether the solut be on the paper or
whether it be in the jar so long as we bring the end of the apparatu to
it if i put the two platinum in by themselv thei come out as clean
and as white as thei go in insert them into the fluid without
connect them with the batteri but when we take the power and lai that
on the platinum were connect with the batteri and again dip into
the solut thi you see exhibit on of the platinum is at onc
turn into copper as it were it ha becom like a plate of copper and
that exhibit the other piec of platinum ha come out quit clean if
i take thi copper piec and chang side the copper will leav the
righthand side and come over to the left side what wa befor the
copper plate come out clean and the plate which wa clean come out
coat with copper and thu you see that the same copper we put into thi
solut we can also take out of it by mean of thi instrument
put that solut asid let us now see what effect thi instrument
will have upon water here ar two littl platinumpl which i intend
to make the end of the batteri and thi c is a littl vessel so shape
as to enabl me to take it to piec and shew you it construct in
these two cup a and b i pour mercuri which touch the end of the
wire connect with the platinumpl in the vessel c i pour some
water contain a littl acid but which is put onli for the purpos of
facilit the action it undergo no chang in the process and
connect with the top of the vessel is a bent glass tube d which mai
remind you of the pipe which wa connect with the gun barrel in our
furnac experi and which now pass under the jar f i have now
adjust thi apparatu and we will proce to affect the water in some
wai or other in the other case i sent the water through a tube which wa
made redhot i am now go to pass the electr through the content
of thi vessel perhap i mai boil the water if i do boil the water i
shall get steam and you know that steam condens when it get cold and
you will therefor see by that whether i do boil the water or not
perhap howev i shall not boil the water but produc some other
effect you shall have the experi and see there is on wire which i
will put to thi side a and here is the other wire which i will put to
the other side b and you will soon see whether ani disturb take
place here it is seem to boil up famous but doe it boil let us
see whether that which goe out is steam or not i think you will soon see
the jar f will be fill with vapour if that which rise from the water
is steam but can it be steam why certainli not becaus there it
remain you see unchang there it is stand over the water and it
cannot therefor be steam but must be a perman ga of some sort what
is it is it hydrogen is it anyth els well we will examin it if
it is hydrogen it will burn the lectur then ignit a portion of the
ga collect which burnt with an explos
illustr fig 19
it is certainli someth combust but not combust in the wai that
hydrogen is hydrogen would not have given you that nois but the colour
of that light when the thing did burn wa like that of hydrogen it
will howev burn without contact with the air that is why i have
chosen thi other form of apparatu for the purpos of point out to
you what ar the particular circumst of thi experi in place of
an open vessel i have taken on that is close our batteri is so
beautifulli activ that we ar even boil the mercuri and get all
thing rightnot wrong but vigor right and i am go to shew you
that that ga whatev it mai be can burn without air and in that
respect differ from a candl which cannot burn without the air and our
manner of do thi is as followsi have here a glass vessel g which
is fit with two platinumwir ik through which i can appli
electr and we can put the vessel on the airpump and exhaust the
air and when we have taken the air out we can bring it here and fasten it
on to thi jar f and let into the vessel that ga which wa form by
the action of the voltaic batteri upon the water and which we have
produc by chang the water into itfor i mai go as far as thi and
sai we have realli by that experi chang the water into that ga
we have not onli alter it condit but we have chang it realli and
truli into that gaseou substanc and all the water is there which wa
decompos by the experi as i screw thi vessel gh on here h and
make the tube well connect and when i open the stopcock hhh if
you watch the level of the water in f you will see that the ga will
rise i will now close the stopcock as i have drawn up as much as the
vessel can hold and be safe convei into that chamber i will pass
into it an electr spark from thi leyden jar l when the vessel which
is now quit clear and bright will becom dim there will be no sound
for the vessel is strong enough to confin the explos a spark wa
then pass through the jar when the explos mixtur wa ignit did
you see that brilliant light if i again screw the vessel on to the jar
and open these stopcock you will see that the ga will rise a second
time the stopcock were then open those gase refer to the
gase first collect in the jar and which had just been ignit by the
electr spark have disappear as you see their place is vacant and
fresh ga ha gone in water ha been form from them and if we repeat
our oper repeat the last experi i shall have anoth
vacanc as you will see by the water rise i alwai have an empti
vessel after the explos becaus the vapour or ga into which that
water ha been resolv by the batteri explod under the influenc of the
spark and chang into water and byandbi you will see in thi upper
vessel some drop of water trickl down the side and collect at the
bottom
we ar here deal with water entir without refer to the
atmospher the water of the candl had the atmospher help to produc
it but in thi wai it can be produc independ of the air water
therefor ought to contain that other substanc which the candl take
from the air and which combin with the hydrogen produc water
just now you saw that on end of thi batteri took hold of the copper
extract it from the vessel which contain the blue solut it wa
effect by thi wire and sure we mai sai if the batteri ha such
power with a metal solut which we made and unmad mai we not find
that it is possibl to split asund the compon part of the water and
put them into thi place and that place suppos i take the polesth
metal end of thi batteryand see what will happen with the water in
thi apparatu fig 20 where we have separ the two end far apart
illustr fig 20
i place on here at a and the other there at b and i have littl
shelv with hole which i can put upon each pole and so arrang them
that whatev escap from the two end of the batteri will appear as
separ gase for you saw that the water did not becom vapor but
gaseou the wire ar now in perfect and proper connect with the
vessel contain the water and you see the bubbl rise let us
collect these bubbl and see what thei ar here is a glass cylind o
i fill it with water and put it over on end a of the pile and i will
take anoth h and put it over the other end b of the pile and so now
we have a doubl apparatu with both place deliv ga both these
jar will fill with ga there thei go that to the right h fill veri
rapidli the on to the left o fill not so rapidli and though i have
allow some bubbl to escap yet still the action is go on pretti
regularli and were it not that on is rather smaller than the other you
would see that i should have twice as much in thi h as i have in that
o both these gase ar colourless thei stand over the water without
condens thei ar alik in all thingsi mean in all appar thing
and we have here an opportun of examin these bodi and ascertain
what thei ar their bulk is larg and we can easili appli experi to
them i will take thi jar h first and will ask you to be prepar to
recognis hydrogen
think of all it qualitiesth light ga which stood well in invert
vessel burn with a pale flame at the mouth of the jarand see
whether thi ga doe not satisfi all these condit if it be hydrogen
it will remain here while i hold thi jar invert a light wa then
appli when the hydrogen burnt what is there now in the other jar you
know that the two togeth made an explos mixtur but what can thi
be which we find as the other constitu in water and which must
therefor be that substanc which made the hydrogen burn we know that the
water we put into the vessel consist of the two thing togeth we find
on of these is hydrogen what must that other be which wa in the water
befor the experi and which we now have by itself i am about to put
thi light splinter of wood into the ga the ga itself will not burn
but it will make the splinter of wood burn the lectur ignit the end
of the wood and introduc it into the jar of ga see how it
invigor the combust of the wood and how it make it burn far
better than the air would make it burn and now you see by itself that
everi other substanc which is contain in the water and which when the
water wa form by the burn of the candl must have been taken from
the atmospher what shall we call it a b or c let us call it ocal
it oxygen it is a veri good distinctsound name thi then is the
oxygen which wa present in the water form so larg a part of it
we shall now begin to understand more clearli our experi and
research becaus when we have examin these thing onc or twice we
shall soon see why a candl burn in the air when we have in thi wai
analys the waterthat is to sai separ or electrolys it part
out of itw get two volum of hydrogen and on of the bodi that burn
it and these two ar repres to us on the follow diagram with
their weight also state and we shall find that the oxygen is a veri
heavi bodi by comparison with the hydrogen it is the other element in
water
i had better perhap tell you now how we get thi oxygen abundantli
have shewn you how we can separ it from the water oxygen as you
will immedi imagin exist in the atmospher for how should the
candl burn to produc water without it

oxygen oxygen 889
hydrogen 111

such a thing would be absolut imposs and chemic imposs
without oxygen
illustr fig 21
can we get it from the air well there ar some veri complic and
difficult process by which we can get it from the air but we have
better process there is a substanc call the black oxid of
manganes it is a veri blacklook miner but veri us and when
made redhot it give out oxygen here is an iron bottl which ha had
some of thi substanc put into it and there is a tube fix to it and a
fire readi made and mr anderson will put that retort into the fire for
it is made of iron and can stand the heat here is a salt call chlorat
of potassa which is now made in larg quantiti for bleach and
chemic and medic us and for pyrotechn and other purpos i will
take some and mix it with some of the oxid of manganes oxid of copper
or oxid of iron would do as well and if i put these togeth in a
retort far less than a red heat is suffici to evolv thi oxygen from
the mixtur i am not prepar to make much becaus we onli want
suffici for our experi onli as you will see immedi if i
us too small a charg the first portion of the ga will be mix with
the air alreadi in the retort and i should be oblig to sacrific the
first portion of the ga becaus it would be so much dilut with air
the first portion must therefor be thrown awai you will find in thi
case that a common spiritlamp is quit suffici for me to get the
oxygen and so we shall have two process go on for it prepar
see how freeli the ga is come over from that small portion of the
mixtur we will examin it and see what ar it properti now in thi
wai we ar produc as you will observ a ga just like the on we had
in the experi with the batteri transpar undissolv by water and
present the ordinari visibl properti of the atmospher as thi
first jar contain the air togeth with the first portion of the oxygen
set free dure the prepar we will carri it out of the wai and be
prepar to make our experi in a regular dignifi manner and
inasmuch as that power of make wood wax or other thing burn wa so
mark in the oxygen we obtain by mean of the voltaic batteri from
water we mai expect to find the same properti here we will try it you
see there is the combust of a light taper in air and here is it
combust in thi ga lower the taper into the jar see how brightli
and how beautifulli it burn you can also see more than thisyou will
perceiv it is a heavi ga whilst the hydrogen would go up like a
balloon or even faster than a balloon when not encumb with the
weight of the envelop
illustr fig 22
you mai easili see that although we obtain from water twice as much in
volum of the hydrogen as of oxygen it doe not follow that we have twice
as much in weightbecaus on is heavi and the other a veri light ga
we have mean of weigh gase or air but without stop to explain
that let me just tell you what their respect weight ar the weight
of a pint of hydrogen is threequart of a grain the weight of the same
quantiti of oxygen is nearli twelv grain thi is a veri great
differ the weight of a cubit foot of hydrogen is onetwelfth of an
ounc and the weight of a cubit foot of oxygen is on ounc and a third
and so on we might come to mass of matter which mai be weigh in the
balanc and which we can take account of as to hundredweight and as to
ton as you will see almost immedi
now as regard thi veri properti of oxygen support combust which
we mai compar to air i will take a piec of candl to shew it you in a
rough wai and the result will be rough there is our candl burn in
the air how will it burn in oxygen i have here a jar of thi ga and i
am about to put it over the candl for you to compar the action of thi
ga with that of the air why look at it it look someth like the
light you saw at the pole of the voltaic batteri think how vigor that
action must be and yet dure all that action noth more is produc
than what is produc by the burn of the candl in air we have the
same product of water and the same phenomena exactli when we us thi
ga instead of air as we have when the candl is burnt in air
but now we have got a knowledg of thi new substanc we can look at it a
littl more distinctli in order to satisfi ourselv that we have got a
good gener understand of thi part of the product of a candl it is
wonder how great the support power of thi substanc ar as regard
combust for instanc here is a lamp which simpl though it be is
the origin i mai sai of a great varieti of lamp which ar construct
for diver purposesfor lighthous microscop illumin and
other us and if it were propos to make it burn veri brightli you
would sai if a candl burnt better in oxygen will not a lamp do the
same why it will do so mr anderson will give me a tube come from
our oxygen reservoir and i am about to appli it to thi flame which i
will previous make burn badli on purpos there come the oxygen what a
combust that make but if i shut it off what becom of the lamp the
flow of oxygen wa stop and the lamp relaps to it former dim
it is wonder how by mean of oxygen we get combust acceler
but it doe not affect mere the combust of hydrogen or carbon or
the candl but it exalt all combust of the common kind we will take
on which relat to iron for instanc as you have alreadi seen iron
burn a littl in the atmospher here is a jar of oxygen and thi is a
piec of iron wire but if it were a bar as thick as my wrist it would
burn the same
illustr fig 23
i first attach a littl piec of wood to the iron i then set the wood on
fire and let them both down togeth into the jar the wood is now alight
and there it burn as wood should burn in oxygen but it will soon
commun it combust to the iron the iron is now burn
brilliantli and will continu so for a long time as long as we suppli
oxygen so long can we carri on the combust of the iron until the
latter is consum
we will now put that on on side and take some other substanc but we
must limit our experi for we have not time to spare for all the
illustr you would have a right to if we had more time we will take
a piec of sulphury know how sulphur burn in the airwel we put it
into the oxygen and you will see that whatev can burn in air can burn
with a far greater intens in oxygen lead you to think that perhap
the atmospher itself ow all it power of combust to thi ga the
sulphur is now burn veri quietli in the oxygen but you cannot for a
moment mistak the veri high and increas action which take place when
it is so burnt instead of be burnt mere in common air
illustr fig 24
i am now about to shew you the combust of anoth
substancephosphoru i can do it better for you here than you can do it
at home thi is a veri combust substanc and if it be so combust
in air what might you expect it would be in oxygen i am about to shew it
to you not in it fullest intens for if i did so we should almost blow
the apparatu upi mai even now crack the jar though i do not want to
break thing carelessli you see how it burn in the air but what a
gloriou light it give out when i introduc it into oxygen introduc
the light phosphoru into the jar of oxygen there you see the solid
particl go off which caus that combust to be so brilliantli
lumin
thu far we have test thi power of oxygen and the high combust it
produc by mean of other substanc we must now for a littl while
longer look at it as respect the hydrogen you know when we allow the
oxygen and the hydrogen deriv from the water to mix and burn togeth
we had a littl explos you rememb also that when i burnt the
oxygen and the hydrogen in a jet togeth we got veri littl light but
great heat i am now about to set fire to oxygen and hydrogen mix in
the proport in which thei occur in water here is a vessel contain
on volum of oxygen and two volum of hydrogen thi mixtur is exactli
of the same natur as the ga we just now obtain from the voltaic
batteri it would be far too much to burn at onc i have therefor
arrang to blow soapbubbl with it and burn those bubbl that we mai
see by a gener experi or two how thi oxygen support the combust
of the hydrogen first of all we will see whether we can blow a bubbl
well there goe the ga caus it to issu through a tobaccopip into
some soapsud here i have a bubbl i am receiv them on my hand and
you will perhap think i am act oddli in thi experi but it is to
shew you that we must not alwai trust to nois and sound but rather to
real fact explod a bubbl on the palm of hi hand i am afraid to
fire a bubbl from the end of the pipe becaus the explos would pass
up into the jar and blow it to piec thi oxygen then will unit with
the hydrogen as you see by the phenomena and hear by the sound with the
utmost readi of action and all it power ar then taken up in it
neutralis of the qualiti of the hydrogen
so now i think you will perceiv the whole histori of water with refer
to oxygen and the air from what we have befor said why doe a piec of
potassium decompos water becaus it find oxygen in the water what is
set free when i put it in the water as i am about to do again it set
free hydrogen and the hydrogen burn but the potassium itself combin
with oxygen and thi piec of potassium in take the water apartth
water you mai sai deriv from the combust of the candletak awai
the oxygen which the candl took from the air and so set the hydrogen
free and even if i take a piec of ic and put a piec of potassium upon
it the beauti affin by which the oxygen and the hydrogen ar
relat ar such that the ic will absolut set fire to the potassium
i shew thi to you todai in order to enlarg your idea of these thing
and that you mai see how greatli result ar modifi by circumst
there is the potassium on the ic produc a sort of volcan action
it will be my place when next we meet have point out these anomal
action to shew you that none of these extra and strang effect ar met
with by usthat none of these strang and injuri action take place
when we ar burn not mere a candl but ga in our street or fuel
in our fireplac so long as we confin ourselv within the law that
natur ha made for our guidanc
lectur v
oxygen present in the airnatur of the atmosphereit propertiesoth
product from the candlecarbon acidit properti
we have now seen that we can produc hydrogen and oxygen from the water
that we obtain from the candl hydrogen you know come from the
candl and oxygen you believ come from the air but then you have a
right to ask me how is it that the air and the oxygen do not equal
well burn the candl if you rememb what happen when i put a jar of
oxygen over a piec of candl you recollect there wa a veri differ
kind of combust to that which took place in the air now why is thi
it is a veri import question and on i shall endeavour to make you
understand it relat most intim to the natur of the atmospher
and is most import to us
we have sever test for oxygen besid the mere burn of bodi you
have seen a candl burnt in oxygen or in the air you have seen
phosphoru burnt in the air or in oxygen and you have seen ironfil
burnt in oxygen but we have other test besid these and i am about to
refer to on or two of them for the purpos of carri your convict
and your experi further here we have a vessel of oxygen i will shew
it presenc to you if i take a littl spark and put it into that oxygen
you know by the experi you gain the last time we met what will
happen if i put that spark into the jar it will tell you whether we have
oxygen here or not ye we have prove it by combust and now here is
anoth test for oxygen which is a veri curiou and us on i have
here two jar full of ga with a plate between them to prevent their
mix i take the plate awai and the gase ar creep on into the
other what happen sai you thei togeth produc no such combust
as wa seen in the case of the candl but see how the presenc of oxygen
is told by it associ with thi other substance14 what a
beautifulli colour ga i have obtain in thi wai shew me the
presenc of the oxygen in the same wai we can try thi experi by
mix common air with thi testga here is a jar contain airsuch
air as the candl would burn inand here is a jar or bottl contain
the testga i let them come togeth over water and you see the result
the content of the testbottl ar flow into the jar of air and you
see i obtain exactli the same kind of action as befor and that shew me
that there is oxygen in the airth veri same substanc that ha been
alreadi obtain by us from the water produc by the candl but then
beyond that how is it that the candl doe not burn in air as well as in
oxygen we will come to that point at onc i have here two jar thei ar
fill to the same height with ga and the appear to the ey is alik
in both and i realli do not know at present which of these jar contain
oxygen and which contain air although i know thei have previous been
fill with these gase but here is our testga and i am go to work
with the two jar in order to examin whether there is ani differ
between them in the qualiti of redden thi ga i am now go to turn
thi testga into on of the jar and observ what happen there is
redden you see there is then oxygen present we will now test the
other jar but you see thi is not so distinctli red as the first and
further thi curiou thing happensif i take these two gase and shake
them well togeth with water we shall absorb the red ga and then if i
put in more of thi testga and shake again we shall absorb more and i
can go on as long as there be ani oxygen present to produc that effect
if i let in air it will not matter but the moment i introduc water the
red ga disappear and i mai go on in thi wai put in more and more
of the testga until i come to someth left behind which will not
redden ani longer by the us of that particular bodi that render the air
and the oxygen red why is that you see in a moment it is becaus there
is besid oxygen someth els present which is left behind i will
let a littl more air into the jar and if it turn red you will know that
some of that redden ga is still present and that consequ it wa
not for the want of thi produc bodi that that air wa left behind
now you will begin to understand what i am about to sai you saw that
when i burnt phosphoru in a jar as the smoke produc by the phosphoru
and the oxygen of the air condens it left a good deal of ga unburnt
just as thi red ga left someth untouchedther wa in fact thi
ga left behind which the phosphoru cannot touch which the redden
ga cannot touch and thi someth is not oxygen and yet is part of the
atmospher
so that is on wai of open out air into the two thing of which it is
composedoxygen which burn our candl our phosphoru or anyth
els and thi other substancenitrogenwhich will not burn them thi
other part of the air is by far the larger proport and it is a veri
curiou bodi when we come to examin it it is remark curiou and
yet you sai perhap that it is veri uninterest it is uninterest
in some respect becaus of thisthat it shew no brilliant effect of
combust if i test it with a taper as i do oxygen and hydrogen it
doe not burn like hydrogen nor doe it make the taper burn like oxygen
try it in ani wai i will it doe neither the on thing nor the other it
will not take fire it will not let the taper burn it put out the
combust of everyth there is noth that will burn in it in common
circumst it ha no smell it is not sour it doe not dissolv in
water it is neither an acid nor an alkali it is as indiffer to all
our organ as it is possibl for a thing to be and you might sai it is
noth it is not worth chemic attent what doe it do in the air
ah then come our beauti and fine result shewn us by an observ
philosophi suppos in place of have nitrogen or nitrogen and oxygen
we had pure oxygen as our atmospher what would becom of us you know
veri well that a piec of iron lit in a jar of oxygen goe on burn to
the end when you see a fire in an iron grate imagin where the grate
would go to if the whole of the atmospher were oxygen the grate would
burn up more powerfulli than the coalsfor the iron of the grate itself
is even more combust than the coal which we burn in it a fire put
into the middl of a locomot would be a fire in a magazin of fuel if
the atmospher were oxygen the nitrogen lower it down and make it
moder and us for us and then with all that it take awai with it
the fume that you have seen produc from the candl dispers them
throughout the whole of the atmospher and carri them awai to place
where thei ar want to perform a great and gloriou purpos of good to
man for the susten of veget and thu doe a most wonder
work although you sai on examin it why it is a perfectli
indiffer thing thi nitrogen in it ordinari state is an inact
element no action short of the most intens electr forc and then in
the most infinit small degre can caus the nitrogen to combin
directli with the other element of the atmospher or with other thing
round about it it is a perfectli indiffer and therefor to sai a
safe substanc
but befor i take you to that result i must tell you about the atmospher
itself i have written on thi diagram the composit of on hundr
part of atmospher air
bulk weight
oxygen 20 223
nitrogen 80 777
100 1000
it is a true analysi of the atmospher so far as regard the quantiti of
oxygen and the quantiti of nitrogen present by our analysi we find that
5 pint of the atmospher contain onli 1 pint of oxygen and 4 pint or 4
part of nitrogen by bulk that is our analysi of the atmospher it
requir all that quantiti of nitrogen to reduc the oxygen down so as to
be abl to suppli the candl properli with fuel so as to suppli us with
an atmospher which our lung can healthili and safe breath for it is
just as import to make the oxygen right for us to breath as it is to
make the atmospher right for the burn of the fire and the candl
but now for thi atmospher first of all let me tell you the weight of
these gase a pint of nitrogen weigh 10 grain or a cubic foot
weigh 1 ounc that is the weight of the nitrogen the oxygen is
heavier a pint of it weigh 11 grain and a cubic foot weigh 1
ounc a pint of air weigh about 10 grain and a cubic foot 1
ounc
illustr fig 25
you have ask me sever time and i am veri glad you have how do you
weigh gase i will shew you it is veri simpl and easili done here is
a balanc and here a copper bottl made as light as we can consist
with due strength turn veri nice in the lath and made perfectli
airtight with a stopcock which we can open and shut which at present
is open and therefor allow the bottl to be full of air i have here a
nicelyadjust balanc in which i think the bottl in it present
condit will be balanc by the weight on the other side and here is a
pump by which we can forc the air into thi bottl and with it we will
forc in a certain number of volum of air as measur by the pump
twenti measur were pump in we will shut that in and put it in the
balanc see how it sink it is much heavier than it wa by what by
the air that we have forc into it by the pump there is not a greater
bulk of air but there is the same bulk of heavier air becaus we
have forc in air upon it and that you mai have a fair notion in your
mind as to how much thi air measur here is a jar full of water we
will open that copper vessel into thi jar and let the air return to it
former state all i have to do now is to screw them tightli togeth and
to turn the tap when there you see is the bulk of the twenti pump of
air which i forc into the bottl and to make sure that we have been
quit correct in what we have been do we will take the bottl again to
the balanc and if it is now counterpois by the origin weight we
shall be quit sure we have made our experi correctli
illustr fig 26
it is balanc so you see we can find out the weight of the extra
volum of air forc in in that wai and by that mean we ar abl to
ascertain that a cubic foot of air weigh 1 ounc but that small
experi will by no mean convei to your mind the whole liter truth of
thi matter it is wonder how it accumul when you come to larger
volum thi bulk of air a cubic foot weigh 1 ounc what do you
think of the content of that box abov there which i have had made for
the purpos the air which is within that box weigh on pounda full
pound and i have calcul the weight of the air in thi roomyou
would hardli imagin it but it is abov a ton so rapidli do the weight
rise up and so import is the presenc of the atmospher and of the
oxygen and the nitrogen in it and the us it perform in convei thing
to and fro from place to place and carri bad vapour to place where
thei will do good instead of harm
have given you that littl illustr with respect to the weight of
the air let me shew you certain consequ of it you have a right to
them becaus you would not understand so much without it do you rememb
thi kind of experi have you ever seen it suppos i take a pump
somewhat similar to the on i had a littl while ago to forc air into the
bottl and suppos i place it in such a manner that by certain
arrang i can appli my hand to it my hand move about in the air so
easili that it seem to feel noth and i can hardli get veloc enough
by ani motion of my own in the atmospher to make sure that there is much
resist to it
illustr fig 27
but when i put my hand here on the airpump receiv which wa
afterward exhaust you see what happen why is my hand fasten to
thi place and why am i abl to pull thi pump about and see how is it
that i can hardli get my hand awai why is thi it is the weight of the
airth weight of the air that is abov i have anoth experi here
which i think will explain to you more about it when the air is pump
from underneath the bladder which is stretch over thi glass you will
see the effect in anoth shape the top is quit flat at present but i
will make a veri littl motion with the pump and now look at itse how
it ha gone down see how it is bent in you will see the bladder go in
more and more until at last i expect it will be driven in and broken by
the forc of the atmospher press upon it
illustr fig 28
the bladder at last broke with a loud report now that wa done
entir by the weight of the air press on it and you can easili
understand how that is the particl that ar pile up in the atmospher
stand upon each other as these five cube do you can easili conceiv
that four of these five cube ar rest upon the bottom on and if i
take that awai the other will all sink down so it is with the
atmospher the air that is abov is sustain by the air that is beneath
and when the air is pump awai from beneath them the chang occur which
you saw when i place my hand on the airpump and which you saw in the
case of the bladder and which you shall see better here i have ti over
thi jar a piec of sheet indiarubb and i am now about to take awai
the air from the insid of the jar and if you will watch the
indiarubberwhich act as a partit between the air below and the air
abovey will see when i pump how the pressur shew itself see where
it is go toi can actual put my hand into the jar and yet thi
result is onli caus by the great and power action of the air abov
how beautifulli it shew thi curiou circumst
here is someth that you can have a pull at when i have finish
todai it is a littl apparatu of two hollow brass hemispher close
fit togeth and have connect with it a pipe and a cock through
which we can exhaust the air from the insid and although the two halv
ar so easili taken apart while the air is left within yet you will see
when we exhaust it byandbi no power of ani two of you will be abl to
pull them apart everi squar inch of surfac that is contain in the
area of that vessel sustain fifteen pound by weight or nearli so when
the air is taken out and you mai try your strength present in see
whether you can overcom that pressur of the atmospher
here is anoth veri pretti thingth boi sucker onli refin by the
philosoph we young on have a perfect right to take toi and make
them into philosophi inasmuch as nowadai we ar turn philosophi
into toi here is a sucker onli it is made of indiarubb if i clap it
upon the tabl you see at onc it hold why doe it hold i can slip it
about and yet if i try to pull it up it seem as if it would pull the
tabl with it i can easili make it slip about from place to place but
onli when i bring it to the edg of the tabl can i get it off it is onli
kept down by the pressur of the atmospher abov we have a coupl of
them and if you take these two and press them togeth you will see how
firmli thei stick and inde we mai us them as thei ar propos to be
us to stick against window or against wall where thei will adher
for an even and serv to hang anyth on that you want i think
howev that you boi ought to be shewn experi that you can make at
home and so here is a veri pretti experi in illustr of the
pressur of the atmospher here is a tumbler of water suppos i were to
ask you to turn that tumbler upsidedown so that the water should not
fall out and yet not be kept in by your hand but mere by us the
pressur of the atmospher could you do that take a wineglass either
quit full or halfful of water and put a flat card on the top turn it
upsidedown and then see what becom of the card and of the water the
air cannot get in becaus the water by it capillari attract round the
edg keep it out
i think thi will give you a correct notion of what you mai call the
materi of the air and when i tell you that the box hold a pound of
it and thi room more than a ton you will begin to think that air is
someth veri seriou i will make anoth experi to convinc you of
thi posit resist there is that beauti experi of the
popgun made so well and so easili you know out of a quill or a tube
or anyth of that kindwher we take a slice of potato for instanc
or an appl and take the tube and cut out a pellet as i have now done
and push it to on end i have made that end tight and now i take anoth
piec and put it in it will confin the air that is within the tube
perfectli and complet for our purpos and i shall now find it
absolut imposs by ani forc of mine to drive that littl pellet
close up to the other it cannot be done i mai press the air to a certain
extent but if i go on press long befor it come to the second the
confin air will drive the front on out with a forc someth like that
of gunpowd for gunpowd is in part depend upon the same action that
you see here exemplifi
i saw the other dai an experi which pleas me much as i thought it
would serv our purpos here i ought to have held my tongu for four or
five minut befor begin thi experi becaus it depend upon my
lung for success by the proper applic of air i expect to be abl
to drive thi egg out of on cup into the other by the forc of my breath
but if i fail it is in a good caus and i do not promis success
becaus i have been talk more than i ought to do to make the experi
succe
the lectur here tri the experi and succeed in blow the egg
from on eggcup to the other
you see that the air which i blow goe downward between the egg and the
cup and make a blast under the egg and is thu abl to lift a heavi
thingfor a full egg is a veri heavi thing for air to lift if you want
to make the experi you had better boil the egg quit hard first and
then you mai veri safe try to blow it from on cup to the other with a
littl care
i have now kept you long enough upon thi properti of the weight of the
air but there is anoth thing i should like to mention you saw the wai
in which in thi popgun i wa abl to drive the second piec of potato
half or twothird of an inch befor the first piec start by virtu of
the elast of the airjust as i press into the copper bottl the
particl of air by mean of the pump now thi depend upon a wonder
properti in the air name it elast and i should like to give you
a good illustr of thi if i take anyth that confin the air
properli as thi membran which also is abl to contract and expand so
as to give us a measur of the elast of the air and confin in thi
bladder a certain portion of air and then if we take the atmospher off
from the outsid of it just as in these case we put the pressur onif
we take the pressur off you will see how it will then go on expand
and expand larger and larger until it will fill the whole of thi
belljar shew you that wonder properti of the air it elast
it compress and expans to an exceedingli larg extent
and which is veri essenti for the purpos and servic it perform in
the economi of creation
we will now turn to anoth veri import part of our subject
rememb that we have examin the candl in it burn and have
found that it give rise to variou product we have the product you
know of soot of water and of someth els which you have not yet
examin we have collect the water but have allow the other thing
to go into the air let us now examin some of these other product
here is an experi which i think will help you in part in thi wai we
will put our candl there and place over it a chimnei thu i think my
candl will go on burn becaus the airpassag is open at the bottom
and the top in the first place you see the moistur appearingthat you
know about it is water produc from the candl by the action of the air
upon it hydrogen but besid that someth is go out at the top
it is not moistureit is not waterit is not condens and yet after
all it ha veri singular properti you will find that the air come
out of the top of our chimnei is nearli suffici to blow the light out i
am hold to it and if i put the light fairli oppos to the current it
will blow it quit out you will sai that is as it should be and i am
suppos that you think it ought to do so becaus the nitrogen doe not
support combust and ought to put the candl out sinc the candl will
not burn in nitrogen
illustr fig 29
but is there noth els there than nitrogen i must now anticipatethat
is to sai i must us my own knowledg to suppli you with the mean that
we adopt for the purpos of ascertain these thing and examin such
gase as these i will take an empti bottleher is oneand if i hold it
over thi chimnei i shall get the combust of the candl below send
it result into the bottl abov and we shall soon find that thi bottl
contain not mere an air that is bad as regard the combust of a
taper put into it but have other properti
let me take a littl quicklim and pour some common water on to itth
commonest water will do i will stir it a moment then pour it upon a
piec of filter paper in a funnel and we shall veri quickli have a
clear water proceed to the bottl below as i have here i have plenti
of thi water in anoth bottl but nevertheless i should like to us
the limewat that wa prepar befor you so that you mai see what it
us ar if i take some of thi beauti clear limewat and pour it
into thi jar which ha collect the air from the candl you will see a
chang come about do you see that the water ha becom quit milki
observ that will not happen with air mere here is a bottl fill
with air and if i put a littl limewat into it neither the oxygen nor
the nitrogen nor anyth els that is in that quantiti of air will make
ani chang in the limewat it remain perfectli clear and no shake
of that quantiti of limewat with that quantiti of air in it common
state will caus ani chang but if i take thi bottl with the
limewat and hold it so as to get the gener product of the candl in
contact with it in a veri short time we shall have it milki there is the
chalk consist of the lime which we us in make the limewat
combin with someth that came from the candlethat other product
which we ar in search of and which i want to tell you about todai thi
is a substanc made visibl to us by it action which is not the action
of the limewat either upon the oxygen or upon the nitrogen nor upon
the water itself but it is someth new to us from the candl and then
we find thi white powder produc by the limewat and the vapour from
the candl appear to us veri much like whiten or chalk and when
examin it doe prove to be exactli the same substanc as whiten or
chalk so we ar led or have been led to observ upon the variou
circumst of thi experi and to trace thi product of chalk to
it variou caus to give us the true knowledg of the natur of thi
combust of the candleto find that thi substanc issu from the
candl is exactli the same as that substanc which would issu from a
retort if i were to put some chalk into it with a littl moistur and
make it redhot you would then find that exactli the same substanc would
issu from it as from the candl
but we have a better mean of get thi substanc and in greater
quantiti so as to ascertain what it gener charact ar we find thi
substanc in veri great abund in a multitud of case where you would
least expect it all limeston contain a great deal of thi ga which
issu from the candl and which we call carbon acid all chalk all
shell all coral contain a great quantiti of thi curiou air we find
it fix in these stone for which reason dr black call it fix
airfind it in these fix thing like marbl and chalk he call it
fix air becaus it lost it qualiti of air and assum the condit
of a solid bodi we can easili get thi air from marbl here is a jar
contain a littl muriat acid and here is a taper which if i put it
into that jar will shew onli the presenc of common air there is you
see pure air down to the bottom the jar is full of it here is a
substancemarble17 a veri beauti and superior marbleand if i put
these piec of marbl into the jar a great boil appar goe on
that howev is not steamit is a ga that is rise up and if i now
search the jar by a candl i shall have exactli the same effect produc
upon the taper as i had from the air which issu from the end of the
chimnei over the burn candl it is exactli the same action and caus
by the veri same substanc that issu from the candl and in thi wai we
can get carbon acid in great abundancew have alreadi nearli fill
the jar we also find that thi ga is not mere contain in marbl
here is a vessel in which i have put some common whiteningchalk which
ha been wash in water and depriv of it coarser particl and so
suppli to the plaster as whiten here is a larg jar contain
thi whiten and water and i have here some strong sulphur acid
which is the acid you might have to us if you were to make these
experi onli in us thi acid with limeston the bodi that is
produc is an insolubl substanc wherea the muriat acid produc a
solubl substanc that doe not so much thicken the water and you will
seek out a reason why i take thi kind of apparatu for the purpos of
shew thi experi i do it becaus you mai repeat in a small wai
what i am about to do in a larg on you will have here just the same
kind of action and i am evolv in thi larg jar carbon acid exactli
the same in it natur and properti as the ga which we obtain from
the combust of the candl in the atmospher and no matter how
differ the two method by which we prepar thi carbon acid you will
see when we get to the end of our subject that it is all exactli the
same whether prepar in the on wai or in the other
we will now proce to the next experi with regard to thi ga what
is it natur here is on of the vessel full and we will try it as we
have done so mani other gase by combust you see it is not
combust nor doe it support combust neither as we know doe it
dissolv much in water becaus we collect it over water veri easili
then you know that it ha an effect and becom white in contact with
limewat and when it doe becom white in that wai it becom on of
the constitu to make carbon of lime or limeston
the next thing i must shew you is that it realli doe dissolv a littl
in water and therefor that it is unlik oxygen and hydrogen in that
respect i have here an apparatu by which we can produc thi solut in
the lower part of thi apparatu is marbl and acid and in the upper part
cold water the valv ar so arrang that the ga can get from on to
the other i will set it in action now and you can see the ga bubbl
up through the water as it ha been do all night long and by thi
time we shall find that we have thi substanc dissolv in the water if
i take a glass and draw off some of the water i find that it tast a
littl acid to the mouth it is impregn with carbon acid and if i
now appli a littl limewat to it that will give us a test of it
presenc thi water will make the limewat turbid and white which is
proof of the presenc of carbon acid
then it is a veri weighti gasit is heavier than the atmospher i have
put their respect weight at the lower part of thi tabl along with
for comparison the weight of the other gase we have been examin
pint cubic foot
hydrogen grain ounc
oxygen 11 1
nitrogen 10 1
air 10 1
carbon acid 16 1
a pint of it weigh 16 grain and a cubic foot weigh 1 ounc
almost two ounc you can see by mani experi that thi is a heavi
ga suppos i take a glass contain noth els but air and from thi
vessel contain the carbon acid i attempt to pour a littl of thi ga
into that glass i wonder whether ani ha gone in or not i cannot tell by
the appear but i can in thi wai introduc the taper ye there
it is you see and if i were to examin it by limewat i should find
it by that test also i will take thi littl bucket and put it down into
the well of carbon acidinde we too often have real well of
carbon acidand now if there is ani carbon acid i must have got to
it by thi time and it will be in thi bucket which we will examin with
a taper there it is you see it is full of carbon acid
illustr fig 30
there is anoth experi by which i will shew you it weight i have
here a jar suspend at on end of a balanceit is now equipois but
when i pour thi carbon acid into the jar on the on side which now
contain air you will see it sink down at onc becaus of the carbon
acid that i pour into it and now if i examin thi jar with the light
taper i shall find that the carbon acid ha fallen into it and it no
longer ha ani power of support the combust if i blow a
soapbubbl which of cours will be fill with air and let it fall into
thi jar of carbon acid it will float
illustr fig 31
but i shall first of all take on of these littl balloon fill with
air i am not quit sure where the carbon acid is we will just try the
depth and see whereabout is it level there you see we have thi
bladder float on the carbon acid and if i evolv some more of the
carbon acid the bladder will be lift up higher there it goesth
jar is nearli full and now i will see whether i can blow a soapbubbl on
that and float it in the same wai the lectur here blew a soapbubbl
and allow it to fall into the jar of carbon acid when it float in
it midwai it is float as the balloon float by virtu of the
greater weight of the carbon acid than of the air and now have so
far given you the histori of the carbon acida to it sourc in the
candl as to it physic properti and weightwhen we next meet i
shall shew you of what it is compos and where it get it element
from
lectur vi
carbon or charcoalcoalgasrespir and it analog to the burn
of a candleconclus
a ladi who honour me by her presenc at these lectur ha confer a
still further oblig by send me these two candl which ar from
japan and i presum ar made of that substanc to which i refer in a
former lectur you see that thei ar even far more highli ornament than
the french candl and i suppos ar candl of luxuri judg from
their appear thei have a remark peculiar about themnam a
hollow wickthat beauti peculiar which argand introduc into the
lamp and made so valuabl to those who receiv such present from the
east i mai just sai that thi and such like materi gradual undergo a
chang which give them on the surfac a dull and dead appear but
thei mai easili be restor to their origin beauti if the surfac be
rub with a clean cloth or silk handkerchief so as to polish the littl
rugos or rough thi will restor the beauti of the colour i have
so rub on of these candl and you see the differ between it and
the other which ha not been polish but which mai be restor by the
same process observ also that these mould candl from japan ar
made more conic than the mould candl in thi part of the world
i told you when we last met a good deal about carbon acid we found
by the limewat test that when the vapour from the top of the candl or
lamp wa receiv into bottl and test by thi solut of limewat
the composit of which i explain to you and which you can make for
yourselv we had that white opac which wa in fact calcar
matter like shell and coral and mani of the rock and miner in the
earth but i have not yet told you fulli and clearli the chemic histori
of thi substancecarbon acida we have it from the candl and i
must now resum that subject we have seen the product and the natur of
them as thei issu from the candl we have trace the water to it
element and now we have to see where ar the element of the carbon
acid suppli by the candl a few experi will shew thi you
rememb that when a candl burn badli it produc smoke but if it is
burn well there is no smoke and you know that the bright of the
candl is due to thi smoke which becom ignit here is an experi
to prove thi so long as the smoke remain in the flame of the candl and
becom ignit it give a beauti light and never appear to us in
the form of black particl i will light some fuel which is extravag
in it burn thi will serv our purposea littl turpentin on a
spong you see the smoke rise from it and float into the air in
larg quantiti and rememb now the carbon acid that we have from
the candl is from such smoke as that to make that evid to you i will
introduc thi turpentin burn on the spong into a flask where i have
plenti of oxygen the rich part of the atmospher and you now see that
the smoke is all consum thi is the first part of our experi and
now what follow the carbon which you saw fly off from the turpentin
flame in the air is now entir burn in thi oxygen and we shall find
that it will by thi rough and temporari experi give us exactli the
same conclus and result as we had from the combust of the candl
the reason why i make the experi in thi manner is sole that i mai
caus the step of our demonstr to be so simpl that you can never
for a moment lose the train of reason if you onli pai attent all
the carbon which is burn in oxygen or air come out as carbon acid
whilst those particl which ar not so burn shew you the second
substanc in the carbon acidnam the carbonthat bodi which made
the flame so bright whilst there wa plenti of air but which wa thrown
off in excess when there wa not oxygen enough to burn it
i have also to shew you a littl more distinctli the histori of carbon and
oxygen in their union to make carbon acid you ar now better abl to
understand thi than befor and i have prepar three or four experi
by wai of illustr thi jar is fill with oxygen and here is some
carbon which ha been place in a crucibl for the purpos of be made
redhot i keep my jar dry and ventur to give you a result imperfect in
some degre in order that i mai make the experi brighter i am about
to put the oxygen and the carbon togeth that thi is carbon common
charcoal pulveris you will see by the wai in which it burn in the air
let some of the redhot charcoal fall out of the crucibl i am now
about to burn it in oxygen ga and look at the differ it mai appear
to you at a distanc as if it were burn with a flame but it is not so
everi littl piec of charcoal is burn as a spark and whilst it so
burn it is produc carbon acid i special want these two or three
experi to point out what i shall dwell upon more distinctli
byandbythat carbon burn in thi wai and not as a flame
instead of take mani particl of carbon to burn i will take a rather
larg piec which will enabl you to see the form and size and to trace
the effect veri decidedli here is the jar of oxygen and here is the
piec of charcoal to which i have fasten a littl piec of wood which
i can set fire to and so commenc the combust which i could not
conveni do without you now see the charcoal burn but not as a
flame or if there be a flame it is the smallest possibl on which i
know the caus ofnam the format of a littl carbon oxid close
upon the surfac of the carbon it goe on burn you see slowli
produc carbon acid by the union of thi carbon or charcoal thei ar
equival term with the oxygen i have here anoth piec of charcoal
a piec of bark which ha the qualiti of be blown to piecesexplod
as it burn by the effect of the heat we shall reduc the lump of carbon
into particl that will fly off still everi particl equal with the
whole mass burn in thi peculiar wai it burn as a coal and not like a
flame you observ a multitud of littl combust go on but no
flame i do not know a finer experi than thi to shew that carbon
burn with a spark
here then is carbon acid form from it element it is produc at
onc and if we examin it by limewat you will see that we have the
same substanc which i have previous describ to you by put
togeth 6 part of carbon by weight whether it come from the flame of a
candl or from powder charcoal and 16 part of oxygen by weight we
have 22 part of carbon acid and as we saw last time the 22 part of
carbon acid combin with 28 part of lime produc common carbon
of lime if you were to examin an oystershel and weigh the compon
part you would find that everi 50 part would give 6 of carbon and 16 of
oxygen combin with 28 of lime howev i do not want to troubl you
with these minutiit is onli the gener philosophi of the matter that
we can now go into see how fine the carbon is dissolv awai point
to the lump of charcoal burn quietli in the jar of oxygen you mai sai
that the charcoal is actual dissolv in the air round about and if
that were perfectli pure charcoal which we can easili prepar there
would be no residu whatev when we have a perfectli cleans and
purifi piec of carbon there is no ash left the carbon burn as a
solid dens bodi that heat alon cannot chang as to it solid and
yet it pass awai into vapour that never condens into solid or liquid
under ordinari circumst and what is more curiou still is the fact
that the oxygen doe not chang in it bulk by the solut of the carbon
in it just as the bulk is at first so it is at last onli it ha becom
carbon acid
there is anoth experi which i must give you befor you ar fulli
acquaint with the gener natur of carbon acid be a compound
bodi consist of carbon and oxygen carbon acid is a bodi that we
ought to be abl to take asund and so we can as we did with water so
we can with carbon acidtak the two part asund the simplest and
quickest wai is to act upon the carbon acid by a substanc that can
attract the oxygen from it and leav the carbon behind you recollect
that i took potassium and put it upon water or ic and you saw that it
could take the oxygen from the hydrogen now suppos we do someth of
the same kind here with thi carbon acid you know carbon acid to be a
heavi ga i will not test it with limewat as that will interfer with
our subsequ experi but i think the heavi of the ga and the
power of extinguish flame will be suffici for our purpos i
introduc a flame into the ga and you will see whether it will be put
out you see the light is extinguish inde the ga mai perhap put
out phosphoru which you know ha a pretti strong combust here is a
piec of phosphoru heat to a high degre i introduc it into ga and
you observ the light is put out but it will take fire again in the air
becaus there it reenter into combust now let me take a piec of
potassium a substanc which even at common temperatur can act upon
carbon acid though not suffici for our present purpos becaus it
soon get cover with a protect coat but if we warm it up to the
burn point in air as we have a fair right to do and as we have done
with phosphoru you will see that it can burn in carbon acid and if it
burn it will burn by take oxygen so that you will see what is left
behind i am go then to burn thi potassium in the carbon acid as
a proof of the exist of oxygen in the carbon acid in the
preliminari process of heat the potassium explod sometim we get
an awkward piec of potassium that explod or someth like it when it
burn i will take anoth piec and now that it is heat i introduc
it into the jar and you perceiv that it burn in the carbon acidnot
so well as in the air becaus the carbon acid contain the oxygen
combin but it doe burn and take awai the oxygen if i now put thi
potassium into water i find that besid the potash form which you
need not troubl about there is a quantiti of carbon produc i have
here made the experi in a veri rough wai but i assur you that if i
were to make it carefulli devot a dai to it instead of five minut
we should get all the proper amount of charcoal left in the spoon or in
the place where the potassium wa burn so that there could be no doubt
as to the result here then is the carbon obtain from the carbon
acid as a common black substanc so that you have the entir proof of
the natur of carbon acid as consist of carbon and oxygen and now i
mai tell you that whenev carbon burn under common circumst it
produc carbon acid
suppos i take thi piec of wood and put it into a bottl with
limewat i might shake that limewat up with wood and the atmospher
as long as i pleas it would still remain clear as you see it but
suppos i burn the piec of wood in the air of that bottl you of
cours know i get water do i get carbon acid the experi wa
perform there it is you seethat is to sai the carbon lime
which result from carbon acid and that carbon acid must be form
from the carbon which come from the wood from the candl or ani other
thing inde you have yourselv frequent tri a veri pretti
experi by which you mai see the carbon in wood if you take a piec
of wood and partli burn it and then blow it out you have carbon left
there ar thing that do not shew carbon in thi wai a candl doe not
shew it but it contain carbon here also is a jar of coalga which
produc carbon acid abundantli you do not see the carbon but we can
soon shew it to you i will light it and as long as there is ani ga in
thi cylind it will go on burn you see no carbon but you see a
flame and becaus that is bright it will lead you to guess that there is
carbon in the flame but i will shew it to you by anoth process i have
some of the same ga in anoth vessel mix with a bodi that will burn
the hydrogen of the ga but will not burn the carbon i will light them
with a burn taper and you perceiv the hydrogen is consum but not
the carbon which is left behind as a dens black smoke i hope that by
these three or four experi you will learn to see when carbon is
present and understand what ar the product of combust when ga or
other bodi ar thoroughli burn in the air
befor we leav the subject of carbon let us make a few experi and
remark upon it wonder condit as respect ordinari combust i
have shewn you that the carbon in burn burn onli as a solid bodi and
yet you perceiv that after it is burn it ceas to be a solid there
ar veri few fuel that act like thi it is in fact onli that great
sourc of fuel the carbonac seri the coal charcoal and wood
that can do it i do not know that there is ani other elementari substanc
besid carbon that burn with these condit and if it had not been
so what would happen to us suppos all fuel had been like iron which
when it burn burn into a solid substanc we could not then have such a
combust as you have in thi fireplac here also is anoth kind of
fuel which burn veri wella well as if not better than carbonso
well inde as to take fire of itself when it is in the air as you see
break a tube full of lead pyrophoru thi substanc is lead and you
see how wonderfulli combust it is it is veri much divid and is
like a heap of coal in the fireplac the air can get to it surfac and
insid and so it burn but why doe it not burn in that wai now when it
is ly in a mass empti the content of the tube in a heap on to a
plate of iron simpli becaus the air cannot get to it though it can
produc a great heat the great heat which we want in our furnac and
under our boiler still that which is produc cannot get awai from the
portion which remain unburn underneath and that portion therefor is
prevent from come in contact with the atmospher and cannot be
consum how differ is that from carbon carbon burn just in the same
wai as thi lead doe and so give an intens fire in the furnac or
wherev you choos to burn it but then the bodi produc by it
combust pass awai and the remain carbon is left clear i shew
you how carbon went on dissolv in the oxygen leav no ash wherea
here point to the heap of pyrophoru we have actual more ash than
fuel for it is heavier by the amount of the oxygen which ha unit with
it thu you see the differ between carbon and lead or iron if we
choos iron which give so wonder a result in our applic of thi
fuel either as light or heat if when the carbon burnt the product went
off as a solid bodi you would have had the room fill with an opaqu
substanc as in the case of the phosphoru but when carbon burn
everyth pass up into the atmospher it is in a fix almost
unchang condit befor the combust but afterward it is in the
form of ga which it is veri difficult though we have succeed to
produc in a solid or a liquid state
now i must take you to a veri interest part of our subjectto the
relat between the combust of a candl and that live kind of
combust which goe on within us in everi on of us there is a live
process of combust go on veri similar to that of a candl and i
must try to make that plain to you for it is not mere true in a
poetic senseth relat of the life of man to a taper and if you
will follow i think i can make thi clear in order to make the relat
veri plain i have devis a littl apparatu which we can soon build up
befor you here is a board and a groov cut in it and i can close the
groov at the top part by a littl cover i can then continu the groov
as a channel by a glass tube at each end there be a free passag
through the whole suppos i take a taper or candl we can now be liber
in our us of the word candl sinc we understand what it mean and
place it in on of the tube it will go on you see burn veri well
you observ that the air which feed the flame pass down the tube at on
end then goe along the horizont tube and ascend the tube at the
other end in which the taper is place
illustr fig 32
if i stop the apertur through which the air enter i stop combust as
you perceiv i stop the suppli of air and consequ the candl goe
out but now what will you think of thi fact in a former experi i
shew you the air go from on burn candl to a second candl if i
took the air proceed from anoth candl and sent it down by a
complic arrang into thi tube i should put thi burn candl
out but what will you sai when i tell you that my breath will put out
that candl i do not mean by blow at all but simpli that the natur
of my breath is such that a candl cannot burn in it i will now hold my
mouth over the apertur and without blow the flame in ani wai let no
air enter the tube but what come from my mouth you see the result i did
not blow the candl out i mere let the air which i expir pass into
the apertur and the result wa that the light went out for want of
oxygen and for no other reason someth or othernam my lungshad
taken awai the oxygen from the air and there wa no more to suppli the
combust of the candl it is i think veri pretti to see the time it
take befor the bad air which i throw into thi part of the apparatu ha
reach the candl the candl at first goe on burn but so soon as
the air ha had time to reach it it goe out and now i will shew you
anoth experi becaus thi is an import part of our philosophi
here is a jar which contain fresh air as you can see by the circumst
of a candl or gaslight burn it i make it close for a littl time
and by mean of a pipe i get my mouth over it so that i can inhal the
air by put it over water in the wai that you see i am abl to draw
up thi air suppos the cork to be quit tight take it into my lung
and throw it back into the jar
illustr fig 33
we can then examin it and see the result you observ i first take up
the air and then throw it back as is evid from the ascent and descent
of the water and now by put a taper into the air you will see the
state in which it is by the light be extinguish even on
inspir you see ha complet spoil thi air so that it is no
us my try to breath it a second time now you understand the ground
of the improprieti of mani of the arrang among the hous of the
poorer class by which the air is breath over and over again for the
want of a suppli by mean of proper ventil suffici to produc a
good result you see how bad the air becom by a singl breath so
that you can easili understand how essenti fresh air is to us
to pursu thi a littl further let us see what will happen with
limewat here is a globe which contain a littl limewat and it is
so arrang as regard the pipe as to give access to the air within so
that we can ascertain the effect of respir or unrespir air upon it of
cours i can either draw in air through a and so make the air that
feed my lung go through the limewat or i can forc the air out of my
lung through the tube b which goe to the bottom and so shew it
effect upon the limewat
illustr fig 34
you will observ that howev long i draw the extern air into the
limewat and then through it to my lung i shall produc no effect
upon the waterit will not make the limewat turbid but if i throw the
air from my lung through the limewat sever time in success
you see how white and milki the water is get shew the effect which
expir air ha had upon it and now you begin to know that the atmospher
which we have spoil by respir is spoil by carbon acid for you
see it here in contact with the limewat
i have here two bottl on contain limewat and the other common
water and tube which pass into the bottl and connect them the
apparatu is veri rough but it is us notwithstand
illustr fig 35
if i take these two bottl inhal here and exhal there the
arrang of the tube will prevent the air go backward the air
come in will go to my mouth and lung and in go out will pass
through the limewat so that i can go on breath and make an
experi veri refin in it natur and veri good in it result you
will observ that the good air ha done noth to the limewat in the
other case noth ha come to the limewat but my respir and you
see the differ in the two case
let us now go a littl further what is all thi process go on within
us which we cannot do without either dai or night which is so provid
for by the author of all thing that he ha arrang that it shall be
independ of all will if we restrain our respir as we can to a
certain extent we should destroi ourselv when we ar asleep the
organ of respir and the part that ar associ with them still
go on with their actionso necessari is thi process of respir to
us thi contact of the air with the lung i must tell you in the
briefest possibl manner what thi process is we consum food the food
goe through that strang set of vessel and organ within us and is
brought into variou part of the system into the digest part
especi and altern the portion which is so chang is carri
through our lung by on set of vessel while the air that we inhal and
exhal is drawn into and thrown out of the lung by anoth set of
vessel so that the air and the food come close togeth separ onli
by an exceedingli thin surfac the air can thu act upon the blood by
thi process produc precis the same result in kind as we have seen
in the case of the candl the candl combin with part of the air
form carbon acid and evolv heat so in the lung there is thi
curiou wonder chang take place the air enter combin with
the carbon not carbon in a free state but as in thi case place readi
for action at the moment and make carbon acid and is so thrown out
into the atmospher and thu thi singular result take place we mai
thu look upon the food as fuel let me take that piec of sugar which
will serv my purpos it is a compound of carbon hydrogen and oxygen
similar to a candl as contain the same element though not in the
same proportionth proport be as shewn in thi tabl

hydrogen 11
99
oxygen 88
thi is inde a veri curiou thing which you can well rememb for
the oxygen and hydrogen ar in exactli the proport which form water
so that sugar mai be said to be compound of 72 part of carbon and 99
part of water and it is the carbon in the sugar that combin with the
oxygen carri in by the air in the process of respirationso make us
like candlesproduc these action warmth and far more wonder
result besid for the susten of the system by a most beauti and
simpl process to make thi still more strike i will take a littl
sugar or to hasten the experi i will us some syrup which contain
about threefourth of sugar and a littl water if i put a littl oil of
vitriol on it it take awai the water and leav the carbon in a black
mass the lectur mix the two togeth you see how the carbon is
come out and befor long we shall have a solid mass of charcoal all of
which ha come out of sugar sugar as you know is food and here we have
absolut a solid lump of carbon where you would not have expect it
and if i make arrang so as to oxid the carbon of sugar we shall
have a much more strike result here is sugar and i have here an
oxidizera quicker on than the atmospher and so we shall oxid thi
fuel by a process differ from respir in it form though not
differ in it kind it is the combust of the carbon by the contact
of oxygen which the bodi ha suppli to it if i set thi into action at
onc you will see combust produc just what occur in my
lungstak in oxygen from anoth sourc name the atmospheretak
place here by a more rapid process
you will be astonish when i tell you what thi curiou plai of carbon
amount to a candl will burn some four five six or seven hour what
then must be the daili amount of carbon go up into the air in the wai
of carbon acid what a quantiti of carbon must go from each of us in
respir what a wonder chang of carbon must take place under these
circumst of combust or respir a man in twentyfour hour
convert as much as seven ounc of carbon into carbon acid a milch cow
will convert seventi ounc and a hors seventynin ounc sole by
the act of respir that is the hors in twentyfour hour burn
seventynin ounc of charcoal or carbon in hi organ of respir
to suppli hi natur warmth in that time all the warmblood anim
get their warmth in thi wai by the convers of carbon not in a free
state but in a state of combin and what an extraordinari notion
thi give us of the alter go on in our atmospher as much as
5000000 pound or 548 ton of carbon acid is form by respir
in london alon in twentyfour hour and where doe all thi go up into
the air if the carbon had been like the lead which i shew you or the
iron which in burn produc a solid substanc what would happen
combust could not go on as charcoal burn it becom a vapour and
pass off into the atmospher which is the great vehicl the great
carrier for convei it awai to other place then what becom of it
wonder is it to find that the chang produc by respir which
seem so injuri to us for we cannot breath air twice over is the
veri life and support of plant and veget that grow upon the surfac
of the earth it is the same also under the surfac in the great bodi
of water for fish and other anim respir upon the same principl
though not exactli by contact with the open air
such fish as i have here point to a globe of goldfish respir by the
oxygen which is dissolv from the air by the water and form carbon
acid and thei all move about to produc the on great work of make the
anim and veget kingdom subservi to each other and all the
plant grow upon the surfac of the earth like that which i have
brought here to serv as an illustr absorb carbon these leav ar
take up their carbon from the atmospher to which we have given it in
the form of carbon acid and thei ar grow and prosper give them
a pure air like our and thei could not live in it give them carbon with
other matter and thei live and rejoic thi piec of wood get all it
carbon as the tree and plant get their from the atmospher which as
we have seen carri awai what is bad for us and at the same time good
for themwhat is diseas to the on be health to the other so ar we
made depend not mere upon our fellowcreatur but upon our
fellowexist all natur be ti togeth by the law that make on
part conduc to the good of anoth
there is anoth littl point which i must mention befor we draw to a
closea point which concern the whole of these oper and most
curiou and beauti it is to see it cluster upon and associ with
the bodi that concern usoxygen hydrogen and carbon in differ
state of their exist i shew you just now some powder lead which
i set burning18 and you saw that the moment the fuel wa brought to the
air it act even befor it got out of the bottleth moment the air
crept in it act now there is a case of chemic affin by which all
our oper proce when we breath the same oper is go on
within us when we burn a candl the attract of the differ part
on to the other is go on here it is go on in thi case of the
lead and it is a beauti instanc of chemic affin if the product
of combust rose off from the surfac the lead would take fire and go
on burn to the end but you rememb that we have thi differ
between charcoal and leadthat while the lead can start into action at
onc if there be access of air to it the carbon will remain dai week
month or year the manuscript of herculaneum were written with
carbonac ink and there thei have been for 1800 year or more not
have been at all chang by the atmospher though come in contact
with it under variou circumst now what is the circumst which
make the lead and carbon differ in thi respect it is a strike thing
to see that the matter which is appoint to serv the purpos of fuel
wait in it action it doe not start off burn like the lead and
mani other thing that i could shew you but which i have not encumb
the tabl with but it wait for action thi wait is a curiou and
wonder thing candlesthos japanes candl for instancedo not
start into action at onc like the lead or iron for iron fine divid
doe the same thing as lead but there thei wait for year perhap for
ag without undergo ani alter i have here a suppli of coalga
the jet is give forth the ga but you see it doe not take fireit
come out into the air but it wait till it is hot enough befor it
burn if i make it hot enough it take fire if i blow it out the ga
that is issu forth wait till the light is appli to it again it is
curiou to see how differ substanc waithow some will wait till the
temperatur is rais a littl and other till it is rais a good deal
i have here a littl gunpowd and some guncotton even these thing
differ in the condit under which thei will burn the gunpowd is
compos of carbon and other substanc make it highli combust and
the guncotton is anoth combust prepar thei ar both wait
but thei will start into activ at differ degre of heat or under
differ condit by appli a heat wire to them we shall see
which will start first touch the guncotton with the hot iron you
see the guncotton ha gone off but not even the hottest part of the wire
is now hot enough to fire the gunpowd how beautifulli that shew you
the differ in the degre in which bodi act in thi wai in the on
case the substanc will wait ani time until the associ bodi ar made
activ by heat but in the other as in the process of respir it
wait no time in the lung as soon as the air enter it unit with the
carbon even in the lowest temperatur which the bodi can bear short of
be frozen the action begin at onc produc the carbon acid of
respir and so all thing go on fitli and properli thu you see the
analog between respir and combust is render still more
beauti and strike inde all i can sai to you at the end of these
lectur for we must come to an end at on time or other is to express a
wish that you mai in your gener be fit to compar to a candl that
you mai like it shine as light to those about you that in all your
action you mai justifi the beauti of the taper by make your deed
honour and effectu in the discharg of your duti to your fellowmen
lectur on platinum
deliv befor the royal institut on fridai februari 22
1861
whether i wa to have the honour of appear befor you thi even or
not seem to be doubt upon on or two point on of these i will
mention immedi the other mai or mai not appear dure the cours of
the hour that follow the first point is thi when i wa tempt to
promis thi subject for your attent thi even it wa found upon
a promis and a full intent of perform that promis on the part of my
friend devil of pari to come here to shew befor you a phenomenon in
metallurg chemistri not common in that i have been disappoint hi
intent wa to have fuse here some thirti or forti pound of platinum
and so to have made manifest through my mouth and my statement the
principl of a new process in metallurgi in relat to thi beauti
magnific and valuabl metal but circumst over which neither he
nor i nor other concern have suffici control have prevent the
fulfil of that intent and the period at which i learn the fact
wa so recent that i could hardli leav my place here to be fill by
anoth or permit you who in your kind have come to hear what might
be said to remain unreceiv in the best manner possibl to me under the
circumst i therefor propos to state as well as i can what the
principl ar on which m devil proce by mean of draw and
some subordin or inferior experi the metal platinum of which you
see some veri fine specimen on the tabl ha been known to us about a
hundr year it ha been wrought in a beauti wai in thi countri in
franc and elsewher and suppli to the consum in ingot of thi
kind or in plate such as we have here or in mass that by their veri
fall upon the tabl indic the great weight of the substanc which is
inde nearli at the head of all substanc in that respect thi
substanc ha been given to us hitherto mainli through the philosophi of
dr wollaston whom mani of us know and it is obtain in great puriti
and beauti it is a veri remark metal in mani point besid it
known special us it usual come to us in grain here is a veri fine
specimen of nativ platinum in grain here is also a nugget or ingot and
here ar some small piec gather out of certain alluvi soil in
brazil mexico california and the uralian district of russia
it is strang that thi metal is almost alwai found associ with some
four or five other metal most curiou in their qualiti and
characterist thei ar call platinifer metal and thei have not
onli the relat of be alwai found associ in thi manner but
thei have other relat of a curiou natur which i shall point out to
you by a refer to on of the tabl behind me thi substanc is
alwai nativeit is alwai in the metal state and the metal with
which it is found connect and which ar rare found elsewher ar
palladium rhodium iridium osmium and ruthenium we have the name in
on of the tabl arrang in two column repres as you see two
groupsplatinum iridium and osmium constitut on group and
ruthenium rhodium and palladium the other three of these have the
chemic equival of 98 and the other a chemic equival of
about half that number then the metal of on group have an extrem
specif gravityplatinum be in fact the lightest of the three or
as light as the lightest osmium ha a specif graviti of 214 and is
the heaviest bodi in natur platinum is 2115 and iridium the same the
specif graviti of the other three be onli about half that name
113 121 and 118 then there is thi curiou relat that palladium
and iridium ar veri much alik so that you would scarc know on from
the other though on ha onli half the weight of the other and onli half
the equival power so with iridium and rhodium and osmium and
ruthenium which ar so close alli that thei make pair be
separ each from it own group then these metal ar the most
infus that we possess osmium is the most difficult to fuse inde i
believ it never ha been fuse while everi other metal ha ruthenium
come next iridium next rhodium next platinum next so that it rank
here as a pretti fusibl metal and yet we have been long accustom to
speak of the infus of platinum and next come palladium which is
the most fusibl metal of the whole it is a curiou thing to see thi
fine associ of physic properti come out in metal which ar
group togeth somehow or other in natur but no doubt by caus
which ar relat to analog properti in their situat on the
surfac of the earth for it is in alluvi soil that these thing ar
found
now with regard to thi substanc let me tell you briefli how we get it
the process us to be thi the or which i shew you just now wa
taken and digest in nitromuriat acid of a certain strength and
partli convert into a solut with the leav behind of certain
bodi that i have upon the tabl the platinum be dissolv with care
in acid to the solut the muriat of ammonia wa ad as i am about
to add it here a yellow precipit wa then thrown down as you perceiv
is the case now and thi carefulli wash and cleans gave us that
bodi point to a specimen of the chlorid of platinum and ammonium
the other element or nearli all be eject thi substanc be
heat gave us what we call platinum spong or platinum in the metal
state so fine divid as to form a kind of heavi mass or spong which
at the time that dr wollaston first sent it forth wa not fusibl for
the market or in the manufactur workshop inasmuch as the temperatur
requir wa so high and there were no furnac that could bring the mass
into a globul and caus the part to adher togeth most of our metal
that we obtain from natur and work in our shop ar brought at last
into a mass by fusion i am not awar that there is in the art or
scienc ani other than iron which is not so soft iron we do not bring
togeth by fusion but by a process which is analog to the on that
wa follow in the case of platinum name weld for these divid
grain of spongi platinum have been well wash and sunk in water for
the purpos of exclud air and press togeth and heat and
hammer and press again until thei come into a pretti close dens
compact mass did so coher that when the mass wa put into the furnac
of charcoal and rais to a high temperatur the particl at first
infinit dividedfor thei were chemic dividedadh the on to
the other each to all the rest until thei made that kind of substanc
which you see here which will bear roll and expans of everi kind
no other process than that ha hitherto been adopt for the purpos of
obtain thi substanc from the particl by solut precipit
ignit and weld it certainli is a veri fine thing to see that we
mai so fulli depend upon the properti of the variou substanc we have
to deal with that we can by carri out our process obtain a
materi like thi allow of divis and extens under a roll
milla materi of the finest possibl kind the part be held
togeth not with interstic not with poros but so continu that
no fluid can pass between them and as dr wollaston beautifulli shew
a globul of platinum fuse by the voltaic batteri and the oxyhydrogen
blowpip when drawn into a wire wa not sounder or stronger than thi
wire made by the curiou coalesc of the particl by the stick
power that thei had at high temperatur thi is the process adopt by
messr johnson and matthei to whose great kind i am indebt for
these ingot and for the valuabl assist i have receiv in the
illustr
the treatment howev that i have to bring befor you is of anoth
kind and it is in the hope that we shall be abl befor long to have such
a thing as the manufactur of platinum of thi kind that i am encourag
to come befor you and tell you how far devil ha gone in the matter
and to give you illustr of the principl on which he proce i
think it is but fair that you should see an experi shew you the wai
in which we get the adhes of platinum probabl you all know of the
weld of iron you go into the smith shop and you see him put the
handl of a poker on to the stem and by a littl manag and the
applic of heat he make them on you have no doubt seen him put the
iron into the fire and sprinkl a littl sand upon it he doe not know
the philosophi he call into plai when he sprinkl a littl sand over the
oxid of iron but he ha a fine philosophi there or practis it when
he get hi weld i can shew you here thi beauti circumst of
the stick togeth of the particl up to the fullest possibl
intens of their combin if you were to go into the workshop of
mr matthei and see them hammer and weld awai you would see the
valu of the experi i am about to shew you i have here some
platinumwir thi is a metal which resist the action of acid resist
oxid by heat and chang of ani sort and which therefor i mai
heat in the atmospher without ani flux i bend the wire so as to make the
end cross these i make hot by mean of the blowpip and then by give
them a tap with a hammer i shall make them into on piec now that the
piec ar unit i shall have great difficulti in pull them apart
though thei ar join onli at the point where the two cylindr
surfac came togeth and now i have succeed in pull the wire
apart the divis is not at the point of weld but where the forc of
the pincer ha cut it so that the junction we have effect is a
complet on thi then is the principl of the manufactur and
product of platinum in the old wai
the treatment which devil propos to carri out and which he ha
carri out to a rather larg extent in refer to the russian suppli of
platinum is on altogeth by heat have littl or no refer to the
us of acid that you mai know what the problem is look at thi tabl
which give you the composit of such a piec of platinum or as i
shew you just now wherev it come from the composit is as
complic though the proport vari
platinum 764
iridium 43
rhodium 03
palladium 14
gold 04
copper 41
iron 117
osmid of iridium 05

1005
thi refer to the uralian or in that state of combin as shewn in
the tabl the iridium and osmium ar found combin in crystal
sometim to the amount of 05 per cent and sometim 3 or 4 per cent
now thi devil propos to deal with in the dry wai in the place of
deal with it by ani acid
i have here anoth kind of platinum and i shew it to you for thi
reason the russian govern have larg store of platinum in their
dominion have obtain it in a metal state and work it into coin
the coin i have in my hand is a twelv silver roubl piec the roubl is
worth three shill and thi coin is therefor of the valu of
thirtysix shill the smaller coin is worth half that sum and the
other half of that the metal howev is unfit for coinag when you
have the two metal gold and silver us for coinag you have a littl
confus in the valu of the two in the market but when you have three
preciou metal for you mai call platinum a preciou metal work into
coin thei will be sure to run counter to on anoth inde the case
did happen that the price of platinum coin fix by the govern wa
such that it wa worth while to purchas platinum in other countri and
make coin of it and then take it into that countri and circul it the
result wa that the russian govern stop the issu the composit
of thi coin isplatinum 970 iridium 12 rhodium 05 palladium
025 a littl copper and a littl iron it is in fact bad platinum it
scale and it ha an unfit for commerci us and in the laboratori
which the other wellpurifi platinum ha not it want work over
again
now devil process depend upon three pointsupon intens heat
blowpip action and the volatil of certain metal we know that there
ar plenti of metal that ar volatil but thi i think is the first
time that it ha been propos to us the volatil of certain
metalssuch as gold and palladiumfor the purpos of drive them off
and leav someth els behind he count larg upon the volatil
of metal which we have not been in the habit of consid volatil but
which we have rather look upon as fix and i must endeavour to
illustr these three point by a few experi perhap i can best
show you what is requir in the process of heat platinum by us that
sourc of heat which we have here and which seem to be almost
illimitablenam the voltaic batteri for it is onli in consequ of
the heat that the voltaic batteri affect the platinum by appli the
two extrem of the batteri to thi piec of platinumwir you will
see what result we shall obtain you perceiv that we can take about thi
heat agent wherev we like and deal with it as we pleas limit it
in ani wai i am oblig to deal carefulli with it but even that
circumst will have an interest for you in watch the experi
contact is now made the electr current when compress into thin
conductingwir offer resist evolv heat to a larg extent and
thi is the power by which we work you see the intens glow immedi
impart to the wire and if i appli the heat continu the effect
of the current would be to melt the wire as soon as the contact is
broken the wire resum it former appear and now that we make
contact again you perceiv the glow as befor the experi wa
repeat sever time in rapid success you can see a line of light
though you can scarc perceiv the wire and now that it ha melt with
the great heat if you examin it you will perceiv that it is inde a
set of irregular from end to enda set of littl sphere which ar
strung upon an axi of platinum run through it it is that wire which
mr grove describ as be produc at the moment when fusion of the
whole mass is commenc in the same manner if i take a toler thick
piec of platinum and subject it to the heat that can be produc by thi
batteri you will see the brillianc of the effect produc i shall put
on a pair of spectacl for the experi as there is an injuri
effect of the voltaic spark upon the ey if the action is continu and
it is neither polici nor braveri to subject ani organ to unnecessari
danger and i want at all event to keep the full us of my ey to the
end of the lectur
you now see the action of the heat upon the piec of platinumheat so
great as to break in piec the plate on which the drop of metal fall
you perceiv then that we have suffici power sourc of heat in
natur to deal with platinum i have here an apparatu by which the same
thing can be shewn here is a piec of platinum which is put into a
crucibl of carbon made at the end of on pole of the batteri and you
will see the brilliant light that will be produc there is our furnac
and the platinum is rapidli get heat and now you perceiv that it
is melt and throw off littl particl what a magnific
philosoph instrument thi is when you look at the result which is
ly upon the charcoal you will see a beautifulli fuse piec of
platinum it is now a fieri globul with a surfac so bright and smooth
and reflect that i cannot tell whether it is transpar or opaqu
or what thi then will give you an idea of what ha to be done by ani
process that pretend to deal with thirti or forti or fifti pound of
platinum at onc
let me now tell you briefli what devil propos to do first of all he
take thi or with it impur and mix it as he find it
essenti and best with it own weight of sulphuret of leadlead
combin with sulphur both the lead and the sulphur ar want for the
iron that is there present as you see by the tabl is on of the most
annoi substanc in the treatment that you can imagin becaus it is
not volatil and while the iron remain adher to the platinum the
platinum will not flow readili it cannot be sent awai by a high
temperatures into the atmospher so as to leav the platinum behind
well then a hundr part of or and a hundr part of sulphuret of
lead with about fifti part of metal lead be all mingl togeth
in a crucibl the sulphur of the sulphuret take the iron the copper
and some of the other metal and impur and combin with them to
form a slag and as it goe on boil and oxidis it carri off the
iron and so a great cleans take place
now you ought to know that these metal such as platinum iridium and
palladium have a strong affin for such metal as lead and tin and
upon thi a great deal depend veri much depend upon the platinum
throw out it impur of iron and so forth by be taken up with
the lead present in it that you mai have a notion of the great power that
platinum ha of combin with other metal i will refer you to a littl
of the chemist experiencehi bad experi he know veri well that
if he take a piec of platinumfoil and heat a piec of lead upon it
or if he take a piec of platinumfoil such as we have here and heat
thing upon it that have lead in them hi platinum is destroi i have
here a piec of platinum and if i appli the heat of the spiritlamp to
it in consequ of the presenc of thi littl piec of lead which i
will place on it i shall make a hole in the metal the heat of the lamp
itself would do no harm to the platinum nor would other chemic mean
but becaus there is a littl lead present and there is an affin
between the two substanc the bodi fuse togeth at onc you see the
hole i have made it is larg enough to put your finger in though the
platinum itself wa as you saw almost infus except by the voltaic
batteri for the purpos of shew thi fact in a more strike manner i
have taken piec of platinumfoil tinfoil and leadfoil and roll
them togeth and if i appli the blowpip to them you will have in
fact a repetit on a larger scale of the experi you saw just now
when the lead and platinum came togeth and on spoil the other when
the metal ar laid on upon the other and fold togeth and heat
appli you will not onli see that the platinum run to wast but that
at the time when the platinum and lead ar combin there is ignit
producedther is a power of sustain combust i have taken a larg
piec that you mai see the phenomenon on a larg scale you saw the
ignit and the explos which follow of which we have here the
resultsth consequ of the chemic affin between the platinum and
the metal combin with it which is the thing upon which devil found
hi first result
when he ha melt these substanc and stir them well up and so
obtain a complet mixtur he throw in air upon the surfac to burn off
all the sulphur from the remain sulphuret of lead and at last he get
an ingot of lead with platinummuch lead compar and littl
platinum he get that in the crucibl with a lot of scori and other
thing which he treat afterward it is that platinifer lead which we
have to deal with in our futur process now let me tell you what he doe
with it hi first object is to get rid of the lead he ha thrown out all
the iron and a number of other thing and he ha got thi kind of
compound indic in the tabl he mai get it as high as 78 per cent of
platinum and 22 of lead or 5 or 10 or 15 of platinum and 95 or 90
or 85 of lead which he call weak platinum and he then place it in the
kind of vessel that you see befor you suppos we had the mixtur here
we should have to make it hot and then throw in air upon the surfac the
combust metalthat is the leadand the part that will oxidis ar
thoroughli oxidis the litharg would flow out in a fuse state into a
vessel place to receiv it and the platinum remain behind
illustr fig 36
here is the process which devil adopt for the purpos of cast off
the lead after he ha got out the platinum from the or have made us
of your friend you get rid of him as quickli as you can he get hi
heat by appli the combin of oxygen and hydrogen or of carburet
fuel for the purpos of produc a fire i have here a sourc of
coalga there i have a sourc of hydrogen and here i have a sourc of
oxygen i have here also on of the blowpip us by devil in hi
process for work platinum in the wai i have spoken of there ar two
pipe and on of them goe to the sourc of coalga and the other to
the suppli of oxygen
illustr fig 37
by unit these we obtain a flame of such a heat as to melt platinum you
will perhap hardli imagin what the heat is unless you have some proof
of it but you will soon see that i have actual the power of melt
platinum here is a piec of platinumfoil run like wax under the
flame which i am bring to bear against it the question howev is
whether we shall get heat enough to melt not thi small quantiti but
larg massesmani pound of the metal have obtain heat like thi
the next consider is what vessel is he to emploi which could retain
the platinum when so heat or bear the effect of the flame such
vessel ar happili well suppli at pari and ar form of a substanc
which surround pari it is a kind of chalk call i believ by
geologist calcair grossir and it ha the properti of endur an
extrem degre of heat i am now go to get the highest heat that we can
obtain first i shew you the combust of hydrogen by itself i have not
a larg suppli becaus the coalga is suffici for most of our
purpos if i put a piec of lime obtain from thi chalk into the ga
you see we get a pretti hot flame which would burn on finger a good
deal but now let me subject a piec of it to the joint action of oxygen
and hydrogen i do thi for the purpos of shew you the valu of lime
as a materi for the furnac and chamber that ar to contain the
substanc to be oper on and that ar consequ to sustain the
action of thi extrem heat here we have the hydrogen and the oxygen
which will give the most intens heat that can be obtain by chemic
action and if i put a piec of lime into the flame we get what is call
the limelight now with all the beauti and intens of action which you
perceiv there is no sensibl deterior of the lime except by the
mechan forc of the current of gase rush from the jet against the
lime sweep awai such particl as ar not strongli aggreg vapour
of lime some call it and it mai be so but there is no other chang of
the lime than that under the action of heat of thi highlyexalt
chemic condit though almost ani other substanc would melt at onc
then as to the wai in which the heat is appli to the substanc it is
all veri well for me to take a piec of antimoni and fuse it in the flame
of a blowpip but if i tri thi piec in the ordinari lamp flame i
should do noth if i tri a smaller piec i should do littl or
noth and if i tri a still smaller piec i should do littl or
noth yet i have a condit which will repres what devil carri
to the highest possibl extent and which we all carri to the highest
extent in the us of the blowpip suppos i take thi piec of antimoni
i shall not be abl to melt it in that flame of the candl by mere
hold it there yet by take pain we can even melt a piec of
platinum there thi is a prepar which i made for the purpos of
prove the fusibl of platinum in a common candl there is a piec of
wire drawn by that ingeni process of dr wollaston not more than
the threethousandth part of an inch in diamet he put the wire into the
middl of a cylind of silver and drew both togeth until the whole
compound wa exceedingli thin and then he dissolv awai the silver by
nitric acid there wa left in the centr a substanc which i can scarc
see with an eyeglass but which i know is there and which i can make
visibl as you see by put it into the candl where the heat make
it glow like a spark i have again and again tri thi experi
upstair in my own room and have easili fuse thi platinumwir by a
common candl you see we have therefor heat enough in the candl as
in the voltaic batteri or in the highlyexalt combust of the
blowpip but we do not suppli a continu sourc of heat in the veri
act of thi becom ignit the heat radiat so fast that you cannot
accumul enough to caus the fusion of the wire except under the most
care arrang thu i cannot melt that piec of antimoni by simpli
put it into the candl but if i put it upon charcoal and drive the
fieri current against it there will be heat enough to melt it the beauti
of the blowpip is that it send hot air make hot air by the
combust of the flame against the thing to be heat i have onli to
hold the antimoni in the cours of that current and particl by particl
of the current imping upon the antimoni and so we get it melt you
now see it redhot and i have no doubt it will continu to burn if i
withdraw it from the flame and continu to forc the air on it now you
see it burn without ani heat but that of it own combust which i am
keep up by send the air against it it would go out in a moment if i
took awai the current of air from it but there it is burn and the
more air i give it by thi or ani other action the better it is so
then we have here not mere a mighti sourc of heat but a mean of
drive the heat forcibl against substanc
let me shew you anoth experi with a piec of iron it will serv two
purposesshew you what the blowpip doe as a sourc of heat and what
it doe by send that heat where it is want i have taken iron in
contrast with silver or other metal that you mai see the differ of
action and so be more interest in the experi here is our fuel the
coalga and here our oxygen have thu my power of heat i appli it to
the iron which as you see soon get redhot it is now flow about
like a globul of melt mercuri but observ i cannot rais ani vapour
it is now cover with a coat of melt oxid and unless i have a great
power in my blowpip it is hardli possibl to break through it now
then you see these beauti spark you have not onli a beauti kind
of combust but you see the iron is be driven off not produc
smoke but burn in a fix condit how differ thi is from the
action of some other metalsthat piec of antimoni for instanc which
we saw just now throw off abund of fume we can of cours burn
awai thi iron by give plenti of air to it but with the bodi which
devil want to expos to thi intens heat he ha not that mean the
ga itself must have power enough to drive off the slag which form on the
surfac of the metal and power to imping upon the platinum so as to get
the full contact that he want for the fusion to take place we see here
then the mean to which he resortsoxygen and either coalga or
watergas19 or pure hydrogen for produc heat and the blowpip for
the purpos of impel the heat current upon the metal
i have two or three rough draw here repres the kind of furnac
which he emploi thei ar larger howev than the actual furnac he
us even the furnac in which he carri on that most seriou oper
of fuse fifti pound of platinum at onc is not much more than half the
size of the draw it is made of a piec of lime below and a piec of
lime abov you see how beautifulli lime sustain heat without alter in
shape and you mai have thought how beautifulli it prevent the
dissip of the heat by it veri bad conduct power
illustr fig 38
while the front part of the lime which you saw here wa so highli ignit
i could at ani moment touch the back of it without feel ani annoy
from the heat so by have a chamber of lime of thi sort he is abl to
get a vessel to contain these metal with scarc ani loss of heat he
put the blowpip through these apertur and send down these gase
upon the metal which ar gradual melt he then put in more metal
through a hole at the top the result of the combust issu out of the
apertur which you see repres if there be strip of platinum he
push them through the mouth out of which the heat current is come
and there thei get redhot and whitehot befor thei get into the bath of
platinum so he is abl to fuse a larg bodi of platinum in thi manner
when the platinum is melt he take off the top and pour out from the
bottom piec like a crucibl and make hi cast thi is the furnac by
which he fuse hi forti pound or fifti pound of platinum at onc the
metal is rais to a heat that no ey can bear there is no light and
shadow no chiarooscuro there all is the same intens of glow you
look in and you cannot see where the metal or the lime is it is all as
on we have therefor a platform with a handl which turn upon an
axi that coincid with the gutter that is form for the pour of the
metal and when all is known to be readi by mean of dark glass the
workmen take off the top piec and lift up the handl and the mould be
then place in a proper posit he know that the issu of the metal
will be exactli in the line of the axi no injuri ha ever happen from
the us of thi plan you know with what care it is necessari to carri
such a vessel of mercuri as we have here for fear of turn it over on
on side or the other but if it be a vessel of melt platinum the veri
greatest care must be us becaus the substanc is twice as heavi yet
no injuri ha been done to ani of the workmen in thi oper
i have said that devil depend upon intens heat for carri off
vapour and thi bring me to the point of shew how vapour ar carri
off here is a basin of mercuri which boil easili as you know and
give us the opportun of observ the fact and principl which ar
to guid us i have here two pole of the batteri and if i bring them
into contact with the mercuri see what a develop of vapour we have
the mercuri is fly off rapidli and i might if i pleas put all the
compani around me in a bath of mercuri vapour and so if we take thi
piec of lead and treat it in the same wai it will also give off vapour
observ the fume that rise from it and even if it wa so far enclos
from the air that you could not form ani litharg you would still have
those abund fume fly off i mai also take a piec of gold and shew
you the same thing i have here a piec of gold which i put upon a clean
surfac of pari limeston appli the heat of the blowpip to it you
see how the heat drive off the vapour and if you notic at the end of
the lectur you will observ on the stone a purpl patch of condens
gold thu you see a proof of the volatilis of gold it is the same
with silver you will not be startl if i sometim us on agent and
sometim anoth to illustr a particular point the volatil of gold
and silver is the same thing whether it be effect by the voltaic
batteri or by the blowpip a lump of silver wa place in a charcoal
crucibl between the pole of a voltaic batteri now look at the fume
of silver and observ the peculiar and beauti green colour which thei
produc we shall now shew you thi same process of boil the silver
cast on a screen from the electr lamp which you have befor you and
while dr tyndal is kindli get the lamp readi for thi purpos let
me tell you that devil propos to throw out in thi wai all these
extran thing that i have spoken of except twonam iridium and
rhodium it so happen as he sai that iridium and rhodium do make the
metal more capabl of resist the attack of acid than platinum itself
alloi ar compound up to 25 per cent of rhodium and iridium by which
the chemic inact of the platinum is increas and also it
malleabl and other physic properti the imag of the voltaic
discharg through vapour of silver wa now thrown upon the screen what
you have now on the screen is an invert imag of what you saw when we
heat the silver befor the fine stream that you see around the silver
is the discharg of the electr forc that take place give you that
gloriou green light which you see in the rai and if dr tyndal will
open the top of the lamp you will see the quantiti of fume that will
come out of the apertur shew you at onc the volatil of silver
i have now finish thi imperfect account it is but an apolog for not
have brought the process itself befor you i have done the best i could
under the circumst and i know your kind well for if i were not
awar that i might trust to it i would not appear here so often as i have
done the gradual loss of memori and of my other faculti is make
itself painfulli evid to me and requir everi time i appear befor
you the continu remembr of your kind to enabl me to get
through my task if i should happen to go on too long or should fail in
do what you might desir rememb it is yourselv who ar chargeabl
by wish me to remain i have desir to retir as i think everi man
ought to do befor hi faculti becom impair but i must confess that
the affect i have for thi place and for those who frequent thi
place is such that i hardli know when the proper time ha arriv
