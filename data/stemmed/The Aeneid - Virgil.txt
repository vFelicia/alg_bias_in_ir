to carthag where he see hi friend whom he thought lost and
receiv a kind entertain from the queen dido by devic of

discours with him desir the histori of hi adventur sinc

arm and the man i sing who forcd by fate
and haughti juno unrel hate
expelld and exild left the trojan shore
long labour both by sea and land he bore
and in the doubt war befor he won
the latian realm and built the destind town
hi banishd god restord to rite divin
and settl sure success in hi line
from whenc the race of alban father come
and the long glori of majest rome
o muse the caus and the crime relat
what goddess wa provokd and whenc her hate
for what offenc the queen of heavn began
to persecut so brave so just a man
involvd hi anxiou life in endless care
exposd to want and hurri into war
can heavnli mind such high resent show
or exercis their spite in human woe
against the tiber mouth but far awai
an ancient town wa seat on the sea
a tyrian coloni the peopl made
stout for the war and studiou of their trade
carthag the name belovd by juno more
than her own argo or the samian shore
here stood her chariot here if heavn were kind
the seat of aw empir she designd
yet she had heard an ancient rumour fly
long cite by the peopl of the sky
that time to come should see the trojan race
her carthag ruin and her towr defac
nor thu confind the yoke of sovreign swai
should on the neck of all the nation lai
she ponderd thi and feard it wa in fate
nor could forget the war she wagd of late
for conqur greec against the trojan state
besid long caus work in her mind
and secret seed of envi lai behind
deep graven in her heart the doom remaind
of partial pari and her form disdaind
the grace bestowd on ravishd ganym
electra glori and her injurd bed
each wa a caus alon and all combind
to kindl vengeanc in her haughti mind
for thi far distant from the latian coast
she drove the remnant of the trojan host
and sevn long year th unhappi wandr train
were tossd by storm and scatterd thro the main
such time such toil requird the roman name
such length of labour for so vast a frame
now scarc the trojan fleet with sail and oar
had left behind the fair sicilian shore
entr with cheer shout the watri reign
and plow frothi furrow in the main
when labr still with endless discont
the queen of heavn did thu her furi vent
then am i vanquishd must i yield said she
and must the trojan reign in itali
so fate will have it and jove add hi forc
nor can my powr divert their happi cours
could angri palla with reveng spleen
the grecian navi burn and drown the men
she for the fault of on offend foe
the bolt of jove himself presumd to throw
with whirlwind from beneath she tossd the ship
and bare exposd the bosom of the deep
then as an eagl gripe the trembl game
the wretch yet hiss with her father flame
she strongli seizd and with a burn wound
transfixd and nake on a rock she bound
but i who walk in aw state abov
the majesti of heavn the sister wife of jove
for length of year my fruitless forc emploi
against the thin remain of ruind troi
what nation now to juno powr will prai
or offr on my slight altar lai
thu ragd the goddess and with furi fraught
the restless region of the storm she sought
where in a spaciou cave of live stone

with powr imperi curb the struggl wind
and sound tempest in dark prison bind

and press for releas the mountain rend
high in hi hall th undaunt monarch stand
and shake hi scepter and their rage command
which did he not their unresist swai
would sweep the world befor them in their wai
earth air and sea thro empti space would roll
and heavn would fly befor the drive soul
in fear of thi the father of the god
confind their furi to those dark abod
and lockd em safe within oppressd with mountain load
imposd a king with arbitrari swai
to loos their fetter or their forc allai
to whom the suppliant queen her prayr addressd
and thu the tenor of her suit expressd
o aeolu for to thee the king of heavn
the powr of tempest and of wind ha givn
thy forc alon their furi can restrain
and smooth the wave or swell the troubl main
a race of wandr slave abhorrd by me
with prosprou passag cut the tuscan sea
to fruit itali their cours thei steer
and for their vanquishd god design new templ there
rais all thy wind with night involv the ski
sink or dispers my fatal enemi
twice sevn the charm daughter of the main
around my person wait and bear my train

and make thee father of a happi line

and danc aloft in air and skim along the ground
then settl on the sea the surg sweep
rais liquid mountain and disclos the deep
south east and west with mixd confus roar
and roll the foam billow to the shore
the cabl crack the sailor fear cri
ascend and sabl night involv the ski
and heavn itself is ravishd from their ey
loud peal of thunder from the pole ensu
then flash fire the transient light renew

and present death in variou form appear
struck with unusu fright the trojan chief
with lift hand and ey invok relief
and thrice and four time happi those he cri
that under ilian wall befor their parent di
tydid bravest of the grecian train
why could not i by that strong arm be slain
and lie by nobl hector on the plain
or great sarpedon in those bloodi field
where simoi roll the bodi and the shield
of hero whose dismemberd hand yet bear
the dart aloft and clench the point spear
thu while the piou princ hi fate bewail
fierc borea drove against hi fly sail
and rent the sheet the rage billow rise
and mount the toss vessel to the ski
nor can the shivr oar sustain the blow
the gallei give her side and turn her prow
while those astern descend down the steep
thro gape wave behold the boil deep
three ship were hurri by the southern blast
and on the secret shelv with furi cast
those hidden rock th ausonian sailor knew
thei calld them altar when thei rose in view
and showd their spaciou back abov the flood
three more fierc euru in hi angri mood

and in mid ocean left them moord aland
oront bark that bore the lycian crew
a horrid sight evn in the hero view
from stem to stern by wave wa overborn
the trembl pilot from hi rudder torn
wa headlong hurld thrice round the ship wa tossd
then bulgd at onc and in the deep wa lost
and here and there abov the wave were seen

meantim imperi neptun heard the sound

displeasd and fear for hi watri reign
he reard hi aw head abov the main
seren in majesti then rolld hi ey
around the space of earth and sea and ski
he saw the trojan fleet dispersd distressd
by stormi wind and wintri heavn oppressd
full well the god hi sister envi knew
and what her aim and what her art pursu
he summond euru and the western blast
and first an angri glanc on both he cast
then thu rebukd audaci wind from whenc
thi bold attempt thi rebel insol
is it for you to ravag sea and land
unauthorizd by my suprem command
to rais such mountain on the troubl main
whom ibut first ti fit the billow to restrain
and then you shall be taught obedi to my reign
henc to your lord my royal mandat bear
the realm of ocean and the field of air

the liquid empir fell and trident of the sea
hi powr to hollow cavern is confind
there let him reign the jailer of the wind
with hoars command hi breath subject call
and boast and bluster in hi empti hall
he spoke and while he spoke he smoothd the sea
dispelld the dark and restord the dai
cymotho triton and the seagreen train
of beauteou nymph the daughter of the main
clear from the rock the vessel with their hand
the god himself with readi trident stand
and op the deep and spread the move sand
then heav them off the shoal whereer he guid

and all the rustic arm that furi can suppli
if then some grave and piou man appear
thei hush their nois and lend a listn ear
he sooth with sober word their angri mood
and quench their innat desir of blood
so when the father of the flood appear
and oer the sea hi sovreign trident rear

high on hi chariot and with loosend rein
majest move along and aw peac maintain
the weari trojan ply their shatterd oar
to nearest land and make the libyan shore

and form a port secur for ship to ride
broke by the jut land on either side
in doubl stream the brini water glide
betwixt two row of rock a sylvan scene

a grot is formd beneath with mossi seat
to rest the nereid and exclud the heat
down thro the cranni of the live wall

no haulser need to bind the vessel here
nor beard anchor for no storm thei fear
sevn ship within thi happi harbour meet
the thin remaind of the scatterd fleet
the trojan worn with toil and spent with woe
leap on the welcom land and seek their wishd repos

then grind with marbl and prepar to dine
aenea climb the mountain airi brow
and take a prospect of the sea below
if capi thenc or antheu he could spy

shut up a desert shore to drown men
and drive us to the cruel sea again
if our hard fortun no compass draw

twice ten fat oxen to the ship she send
besid a hundr boar a hundr lamb

on tyrian carpet richli wrought thei dine
with load of massi plate the sideboard shine
and antiqu vase all of gold embossd

the good aenea whose patern care
iulu absenc could no longer bear
dispatchd achat to the ship in hast
to give a glad relat of the past
and fraught with preciou gift to bring the boi
snatchd from the ruin of unhappi troi

from argo by the famd adultress brought
with golden flowr and wind foliag wrought
her mother leda present when she came

new counsel tri and new design prepar
that cupid should assum the shape and face
of sweet ascaniu and the sprightli grace
should bring the present in her nephew stead
and in eliza vein the gentl poison shed
for much she feard the tyrian doubletongu
and knew the town to juno care belongd
these thought by night her golden slumber broke
and thu alarmd to wing love she spoke
my son my strength whose mighti powr alon

and often hast thou mournd with me hi pain
him dido now with blandish detain
but i suspect the town where juno reign
for thi ti need to prevent her art
and fire with love the proud phoenician heart
a love so violent so strong so sure
as neither ag can chang nor art can cure
how thi mai be performd now take my mind
ascaniu by hi father is designd
to come with present laden from the port
to gratifi the queen and gain the court
i mean to plung the boi in pleas sleep
and ravishd in idalian bowr to keep

take thou hi form and shape i beg the grace
but onli for a night revolv space

and with sweet kiss in her arm constrain

and in the sweet resembl take delight

cupid meantim assumd hi form and face
follw achat with a shorter pace
and brought the gift the queen alreadi sate

the tyrian train admit to the feast

but view the beauteou boi with more amaz

but he not mindless of hi mother prayr
work in the pliant bosom of the fair

the dead is to the live love resignd
and all aenea enter in her mind
now when the rage of hunger wa appeasd

all were attent to the godlik man
when from hi lofti couch he thu began
great queen what you command me to relat
renew the sad remembr of our fate
an empir from it old foundat rent
and evri woe the trojan underw
a peopl citi made a desert place
all that i saw and part of which i wa

nor stern ulyss tell without a tear
and now the latter watch of wast night

but sinc you take such intrest in our woe
and troi disastr end desir to know
i will restrain my tear and briefli tell
what in our last and fatal night befel
by destini compelld and in despair
the greek grew weari of the tediou war
and by minerva aid a fabric reard
which like a steed of monstrou height appeard
the side were plankd with pine thei feignd it made
for their return and thi the vow thei paid
thu thei pretend but in the hollow side
select number of their soldier hide
with inward arm the dire machin thei load
and iron bowel stuff the dark abod
in sight of troi li tenedo an isl
while fortun did on priam empir smile
renownd for wealth but sinc a faithless bai
where ship exposd to wind and weather lai
there wa their fleet conceald we thought for greec
their sail were hoist and our fear releas
the trojan coopd within their wall so long
unbar their gate and issu in a throng
like swarm bee and with delight survei
the camp desert where the grecian lai
the quarter of the sevral chief thei showd
here phoenix here achil made abod
here joind the battl there the navi rode
part on the pile their wondr ey emploi
the pile by palla raisd to ruin troi
thymoet first ti doubt whether hird
or so the trojan destini requird
movd that the rampart might be broken down
to lodg the monster fabric in the town
but capi and the rest of sounder mind
the fatal present to the flame design
or to the watri deep at least to bore
the hollow side and hidden fraud explor
the giddi vulgar as their fanci guid
with nois sai noth and in part divid
laocoon followd by a numrou crowd
ran from the fort and cri from far aloud
o wretch countrymen what furi reign
what more than mad ha possessd your brain
think you the grecian from your coast ar gone
and ar ulyss art no better known
thi hollow fabric either must inclos
within it blind recess our secret foe
or ti an engin raisd abov the town
t oerlook the wall and then to batter down
somewhat is sure designd by fraud or forc
trust not their present nor admit the hors
thu have said against the steed he threw
hi forc spear which hiss as it flew
piercd thro the yield plank of joint wood
and trembl in the hollow belli stood
the side transpiercd return a rattl sound
and groan of greek inclosd come issu thro the wound
and had not heavn the fall of troi designd
or had not men been fate to be blind
enough wa said and done tinspir a better mind
then had our lanc piercd the treachrou wood
and ilian towr and priam empir stood
meantim with shout the trojan shepherd bring
a captiv greek in band befor the king
taken to take who made himself their prei
t impos on their belief and troi betrai
fixd on hi aim and obstin bent
to die undaunt or to circumv
about the captiv tide of trojan flow
all press to see and some insult the foe
now hear how well the greek their wile disguisd
behold a nation in a man comprisd
trembl the miscreant stood unarmd and bound
he stard and rolld hi haggard ey around
then said ala what earth remain what sea
is open to receiv unhappi me
what fate a wretch fugit attend
scornd by my foe abandond by my friend
he said and sighd and cast a rueful ey
our piti kindl and our passion die
we cheer the youth to make hi own defenc
and freeli tell us what he wa and whenc
what new he could impart we long to know
and what to credit from a captiv foe
hi fear at length dismissd he said whateer
my fate ordain my word shall be sincer
i neither can nor dare my birth disclaim
greec is my countri sinon is my name
tho plungd by fortun powr in miseri
ti not in fortun powr to make me lie
if ani chanc ha hither brought the name
of palamed not unknown to fame
who sufferd from the malic of the time
accusd and sentencd for pretend crime
becaus these fatal war he would prevent
whose death the wretch greek too late lament
me then a boi my father poor and bare
of other mean commit to hi care
hi kinsman and companion in the war
while fortun favourd while hi arm support
the caus and ruld the counsel of the court
i made some figur there nor wa my name
obscur nor i without my share of fame
but when ulyss with fallaci art
had made impress in the peopl heart
and forgd a treason in my patron name
i speak of thing too far divulgd by fame
my kinsman fell then i without support
in privat mournd hi loss and left the court
mad as i wa i could not bear hi fate
with silent grief but loudli blamd the state
and cursd the dire author of my woe
twa told again and henc my ruin rose
i threatend if indulg heavn onc more
would land me safe on my nativ shore
hi death with doubl vengeanc to restor
thi movd the murder hate and soon ensu
th effect of malic from a man so proud
ambigu rumour thro the camp he spread
and sought by treason my devot head
new crime invent left unturnd no stone
to make my guilt appear and hide hi own
till calcha wa by forc and threatn wrought
but whywhi dwell i on that anxiou thought
if on my nation just reveng you seek
and ti t appear a foe t appear a greek
alreadi you my name and countri know
assuag your thirst of blood and strike the blow
my death will both the kingli brother pleas
and set insati ithacu at eas
thi fair unfinishd tale these broken start
raisd expect in our long heart
unknow as we were in grecian art
hi former trembl onc again renewd
with act fear the villain thu pursu
long had the grecian tird with fruitless care
and weari with an unsuccess war
resolvd to rais the sieg and leav the town
and had the god permit thei had gone
but oft the wintri sea and southern wind
withstood their passag home and changd their mind
portent and prodigi their soul amazd
but most when thi stupend pile wa raisd
then flame meteor hung in air were seen
and thunder rattl thro a sky seren
dismayd and fear of some dire event
eurypylu t enquir their fate wa sent
he from the god thi dread answer brought
o grecian when the trojan shore you sought
your passag with a virgin blood wa bought
so must your safe return be bought again
and grecian blood onc more aton the main
the spread rumour round the peopl ran
all feard and each believd himself the man
ulyss took th advantag of their fright
calld calcha and producd in open sight
then bade him name the wretch ordaind by fate
the public victim to redeem the state
alreadi some presagd the dire event
and saw what sacrific ulyss meant
for twice five dai the good old seer withstood
th intend treason and wa dumb to blood
till tird with endless clamour and pursuit
of ithacu he stood no longer mute
but as it wa agre pronouncd that i
wa destind by the wrath god to die
all praisd the sentenc pleasd the storm should fall
on on alon whose furi threatend all
the dismal dai wa come the priest prepar
their leavend cake and fillet for my hair
i followd natur law and must avow
i broke my bond and fled the fatal blow
hid in a weedi lake all night i lai
secur of safeti when thei saild awai
but now what further hope for me remain
to see my friend or nativ soil again
my tender infant or my care sire
whom thei return will to death requir
will perpetr on them their first design
and take the forfeit of their head for mine
which o if piti mortal mind can move
if there be faith below or god abov
if innoc and truth can claim desert
ye trojan from an injurd wretch avert
fals tear true piti move the king command
to loos hi fetter and unbind hi hand
then add these friendli word dismiss thy fear
forget the greek be mine as thou wert their
but truli tell wa it for forc or guil
or some religi end you raisd the pile
thu said the king he full of fraud art
thi wellinv tale for truth impart
ye lamp of heavn he said and lift high
hi hand now free thou vener sky
inviol powr adord with dread
ye fatal fillet that onc bound thi head
ye sacr altar from whose flame i fled
be all of you adjurd and grant i mai
without a crime th ungrat greek betrai
reveal the secret of the guilti state
and justli punish whom i justli hate
but you o king preserv the faith you gave
if i to save myself your empir save
the grecian hope and all th attempt thei made
were onli found on minerva aid
but from the time when impiou diomed
and fals ulyss that invent head
her fatal imag from the templ drew
the sleep guardian of the castl slew
her virgin statu with their bloodi hand
pollut and profand her holi band
from thenc the tide of fortun left their shore
and ebbd much faster than it flowd befor
their courag languishd as their hope decayd
and palla now avers refusd her aid
nor did the goddess doubtfulli declar
her alterd mind and alien care
when first her fatal imag touchd the ground
she sternli cast her glare ey around
that sparkl as thei rolld and seemd to threat
her heavnli limb distilld a brini sweat
thrice from the ground she leapd wa seen to wield
her brandishd lanc and shake her horrid shield
then calcha bade our host for flight
and hope no conquest from the tediou war
till first thei saild for greec with prayr besought
her injurd powr and better omen brought
and now their navi plow the watri main
yet soon expect it on your shore again
with palla pleasd as calcha did ordain
but first to reconcil the blueeyd maid
for her stoln statu and her towr betrayd
warnd by the seer to her offend name
we raisd and dedic thi wondrou frame
so lofti lest thro your forbidden gate
it pass and intercept our better fate
for onc admit there our hope ar lost
and troi mai then a new palladium boast
for so religion and the god ordain
that if you violat with hand profan
minerva gift your town in flame shall burn
which omen o ye god on grecia turn
but if it climb with your assist hand
the trojan wall and in the citi stand
then troi shall argo and mycena burn
and the revers of fate on us return
with such deceit he gaind their easi heart
too prone to credit hi perfidi art
what diomed nor theti greater son
a thousand ship nor ten year sieg had done
fals tear and fawn word the citi won
a greater omen and of wors portent
did our unwari mind with fear torment
concur to produc the dire event
laocoon neptun priest by lot that year

o sacr citi built by hand divin
o valiant hero of the trojan line
four time he struck as oft the clash sound

of war triumphant in aeacian spoil
or him who made the faint greek retir
and launchd against their navi phrygian fire
hi hair and beard stood stiffend with hi gore
and all the wound he for hi countri bore
now streamd afresh and with new purpl ran
i wept to see the visionari man
and while my tranc continu thu began
o light of trojan and support of troi
thy father champion and thy countri joi
o long expect by thy friend from whenc
art thou so late returnd for our defenc
do we behold thee weari as we ar
with length of labour and with toil of war
after so mani funral of thy own
art thou restord to thy declin town
but sai what wound ar these what new disgrac
deform the manli featur of thy face
to thi the spectr no repli did frame
but answerd to the caus for which he came
and groan from the bottom of hi breast
thi warn in these mourn word expressd
o goddessborn escap by time flight
the flame and horror of thi fatal night
the foe alreadi have possessd the wall
troi nod from high and totter to her fall
enough is paid to priam royal name
more than enough to duti and to fame
if by a mortal hand my father throne
could be defend twa by mine alon
now troi to thee commend her futur state
and give her god companion of thy fate
from their assist wall expect
which wandr long at last thou shalt erect
he said and brought me from their blest abod
the vener statu of the god
with ancient vesta from the sacr choir
the wreath and relic of th immort fire
now peal of shout come thundr from afar
cri threat and loud lament and mingl war
the nois approach tho our palac stood
aloof from street encompassd with a wood
louder and yet more loud i hear th alarm
of human cri distinct and clash arm
fear broke my slumber i no longer stai
but mount the terrac thenc the town survei
and hearken what the fright sound convei
thu when a flood of fire by wind is born
crackl it roll and mow the stand corn
or delug descend on the plain
sweep oer the yellow ear destroi the pain
of labr oxen and the peasant gain
unroot the forest oak and bear awai
flock fold and tree and undistinguishd prei
the shepherd climb the cliff and see from far
the wast ravag of the watri war
then hector faith wa manifestli cleard
and grecian fraud in open light appeard
the palac of deiphobu ascend
in smoki flame and catch on hi friend
ucalegon burn next the sea ar bright
with splendour not their own and shine with trojan light
new clamour and new clangour now aris
the sound of trumpet mixd with fight cri
with frenzi seizd i run to meet th alarm
resolvd on death resolvd to die in arm
but first to gather friend with them t oppos
if fortun favourd and repel the foe
spurrd by my courag by my countri fird
with sens of honour and reveng inspird
pantheu apollo priest a sacr name
had scapd the grecian sword and passd the flame
with relic loaden to my door he fled
and by the hand hi tender grandson led
what hope o pantheu whither can we run
where make a stand and what mai yet be done
scarc had i said when pantheu with a groan
troi is no more and ilium wa a town
the fatal dai th appoint hour is come
when wrath jove irrevoc doom
transfer the trojan state to grecian hand
the fire consum the town the foe command
and arm host an unexpect forc
break from the bowel of the fatal hors
within the gate proud sinon throw about
the flame and foe for entranc press without
with thousand other whom i fear to name
more than from argo or mycena came
to sevral post their parti thei divid
some block the narrow street some scour the wide
the bold thei kill th unwari thei surpris
who fight find death and death find him who fli
the warder of the gate but scarc maintain
th unequ combat and resist in vain
i heard and heavn that wellborn soul inspir
prompt me thro lift sword and rise fire
to run where clash arm and clamour call
and rush undaunt to defend the wall
ripheu and iphita by my side engag
for valour on renownd and on for ag
dyma and hypani by moonlight knew
my motion and my mien and to my parti drew
with young coroebu who by love wa led
to win renown and fair cassandra bed
and late brought hi troop to priam aid
forewarnd in vain by the prophet maid
whom when i saw resolvd in arm to fall
and that on spirit anim all
brave soul said i but brave ala in vain
come finish what our cruel fate ordain
you see the desprat state of our affair
and heavn protect powr ar deaf to prayr
the passiv god behold the greek defil
their templ and abandon to the spoil
their own abod we feebl few conspir
to save a sink town involvd in fire
then let us fall but fall amidst our foe
despair of life the mean of live show
so bold a speech incouragd their desir
of death and ad fuel to their fire
as hungri wolv with rage appetit
scour thro the field nor fear the stormi night
their whelp at home expect the promisd food
and long to temper their dry chap in blood
so rushd we forth at onc resolvd to die
resolvd in death the last extrem to try
we leav the narrow lane behind and dare
th unequ combat in the public squar
night wa our friend our leader wa despair
what tongu can tell the slaughter of that night
what ey can weep the sorrow and affright
an ancient and imperi citi fall
the street ar filld with frequent funer
hous and holi templ float in blood
and hostil nation make a common flood
not onli trojan fall but in their turn
the vanquishd triumph and the victor mourn
our take new courag from despair and night
confusd the fortun is confusd the fight
all part resound with tumult plaint and fear
and grisli death in sundri shape appear
androgeo fell among us with hi band
who thought us grecian newli come to land
from whenc said he my friend thi long delai
you loiter while the spoil ar born awai
our ship ar laden with the trojan store
and you like truant come too late ashor
he said but soon correct hi mistak
found by the doubt answer which we make
amazd he would have shunnd th unequ fight
but we more numrou intercept hi flight
as when some peasant in a bushi brake
ha with unwari foot pressd a snake
he start asid astonishd when he spi
hi rise crest blue neck and roll ey
so from our arm surprisd androgeo fli
in vain for him and hi we compassd round
possessd with fear unknow of the ground
and of their live an easi conquest found
thu fortun on our first endeavor smild
coroebu then with youth hope beguild
swoln with success and a dare mind
thi new invent fatal designd
my friend said he sinc fortun show the wai
ti fit we should th auspici guid obei
for what ha she these grecian arm bestowd
but their destruct and the trojan good
then chang we shield and their devic bear
let fraud suppli the want of forc in war
thei find us arm thi said himself he dressd
in dead androgeo spoil hi upper vest
hi paint buckler and hi plumi crest
thu ripheu dyma all the trojan train
lai down their own attir and strip the slain
mixd with the greek we go with ill presag
flatterd with hope to glut our greedi rage
unknown assault whom we blindli meet
and strew with grecian carcass the street
thu while their straggl parti we defeat
some to the shore and safer ship retreat
and some oppressd with more ignobl fear
remount the hollow hors and pant in secret there
but ah what us of valour can be made
when heavn propiti powr refus their aid
behold the royal prophetess the fair
cassandra draggd by her disheveld hair
whom not minerva shrine nor sacr band
in safeti could protect from sacrilegi hand
on heavn she cast her ey she sighd she cri
twa all she could her tender arm were ti
so sad a sight coroebu could not bear
but fird with rage distract with despair
amid the barbrou ravish he flew
our leader rash exampl we pursu
but storm of stone from the proud templ height
pour down and on our batterd helm alight
we from our friend receivd thi fatal blow
who thought us grecian as we seemd in show
thei aim at the mistaken crest from high
and our beneath the pondrou ruin lie
then movd with anger and disdain to see
their troop dispersd the royal virgin free
the grecian ralli and their powr unit
with furi charg us and renew the fight
the brother king with ajax join their forc
and the whole squadron of thessalian hors
thu when the rival wind their quarrel try
contend for the kingdom of the sky
south east and west on airi courser born
the whirlwind gather and the wood ar torn
then nereu strike the deep the billow rise
and mixd with ooz and sand pollut the ski
the troop we squanderd first again appear
from sever quarter and enclos the rear
thei first observ and to the rest betrai
our diffrent speech our borrowd arm survei
oppressd with odd we fall coroebu first
at palla altar by peneleu piercd
then ripheu followd in th unequ fight
just of hi word observ of the right
heavn thought not so dyma their fate attend
with hypani mistaken by their friend
nor pantheu thee thy mitr nor the band
of aw phoebu savd from impiou hand
ye trojan flame your testimoni bear
what i performd and what i sufferd there
no sword avoid in the fatal strife
exposd to death and prodig of life
wit ye heaven i live not by my fault
i strove to have deservd the death i sought
but when i could not fight and would have di
born off to distanc by the grow tide
old iphitu and i were hurri thenc
with pelia wound and without defenc
new clamour from th invest palac ring
we run to die or disengag the king
so hot th assault so high the tumult rose
while our defend and while the greek oppos
as all the dardan and argol race
had been contract in that narrow space
or as all ilium els were void of fear
and tumult war and slaughter onli there
their target in a tortois cast the foe
secur advanc to the turret rose
some mount the scale ladder some more bold
swerv upward and by post and pillar hold
their left hand gripe their buckler in th ascent
while with their right thei seiz the battlement
from their demolishd towr the trojan throw
huge heap of stone that fall crush the foe
and heavi beam and rafter from the side
such arm their last necess provid
and gild roof come tumbl from on high
the mark of state and ancient royalti
the guard below fixd in the pass attend
the charg undaunt and the gate defend
renewd in courag with recoverd breath
a second time we ran to tempt our death
to clear the palac from the foe succe
the weari live and reveng the dead
a postern door yet unobservd and free
joind by the length of a blind galleri
to the king closet led a wai well known
to hector wife while priam held the throne
thro which she brought astyanax unseen
to cheer hi grandsir and hi grandsir queen
thro thi we pass and mount the towr from whenc
with unavail arm the trojan make defenc
from thi the trembl king had oft descri
the grecian camp and saw their navi ride
beam from it lofti height with sword we hew
then wrench with our hand th assault renew
and where the rafter on the column meet
we push them headlong with our arm and feet
the lightn fli not swifter than the fall
nor thunder louder than the ruind wall
down goe the top at onc the greek beneath
ar piecem torn or pound into death
yet more succe and more to death ar sent
we ceas not from abov nor thei below relent
befor the gate stood pyrrhu threatn loud
with glittr arm conspicu in the crowd
so shine renewd in youth the crest snake

and cast off hi slough when spring return

a mighti breach is made the room conceald

uncoverd but by heavn there stood in view
an altar near the hearth a laurel grew
dodderd with ag whose bough encompass round

here hecuba with all her helpless train
of dame for shelter sought but sought in vain
drivn like a flock of dove along the sky

she said and with a last salut embracd

who takst in wrong an insol delight

thi said hi feebl hand a javelin threw
which fluttr seemd to loiter as it flew

the mingl past hi murderd son had made

then with a speed thrust hi heart he found
the lukewarm blood came rush thro the wound

he who the scepter of all asia swayd
whom monarch like domest slave obeyd
on the bleak shore now li th abandond king
a headless carcass and a nameless thing
then not befor i felt my curdl blood
congeal with fear my hair with horror stood
my father imag filld my piou mind
lest equal year might equal fortun find
again i thought on my forsaken wife
and trembl for my son abandond life
i lookd about but found myself alon
desert at my need my friend were gone
some spent with toil some with despair oppressd
leapd headlong from the height the flame consumd the rest
thu wandr in my wai without a guid
the graceless helen in the porch i spi
of vesta templ there she lurkd alon
muffl she sate and what she could unknown
but by the flame that cast their blaze around
that common bane of greec and troi i found
for ilium burnt she dread the trojan sword
more dread the vengeanc of her injurd lord
evn by those god who refugd her abhorrd
trembl with rage the strumpet i regard
resolvd to give her guilt the due reward
shall she triumphant sail befor the wind
and leav in flame unhappi troi behind
shall she her kingdom and her friend review
in state attend with a captiv crew
while unrevengd the good old priam fall
and grecian fire consum the trojan wall
for thi the phrygian field and xanthian flood
were swelld with bodi and were drunk with blood
ti true a soldier can small honour gain
and boast no conquest from a woman slain
yet shall the fact not pass without applaus
of vengeanc taken in so just a caus
the punishd crime shall set my soul at eas
and murmr mane of my friend appeas
thu while i rave a gleam of pleas light
spread oer the place and shine heavnli bright
my mother stood reveald befor my sight
never so radiant did her ey appear
not her own star confessd a light so clear
great in her charm as when on god abov
she look and breath herself into their love
she held my hand the destind blow to break
then from her rosi lip began to speak
my son from whenc thi mad thi neglect
of my command and those whom i protect
why thi unmanli rage recal to mind
whom you forsak what pledg leav behind
look if your helpless father yet surviv
or if ascaniu or creusa live
around your hous the greedi grecian err
and these had perishd in the nightli war
but for my presenc and protect care
not helen face nor pari wa in fault
but by the god wa thi destruct brought
now cast your ey around while i dissolv

purg from your sight the dross and make you see

she said and swiftli vanishd from my sight
obscur in cloud and gloomi shade of night
i lookd i listend dread sound i hear
and the dire form of hostil god appear
troi sunk in flame i saw nor could prevent
and ilium from it old foundat rent
rent like a mountain ash which dard the wind

and add hi funral to the fate of troi
rather than exil and old ag sustain
go you whose blood run warm in evri vein
had heavn decre that i should life enjoi
heavn had decre to save unhappi troi
ti sure enough if not too much for on
twice to have seen our ilium overthrown
make hast to save the poor remain crew
and give thi useless corps a long adieu
these weak old hand suffic to stop my breath
at least the piti foe will aid my death
to take my spoil and leav my bodi bare
as for my sepulch let heavn take care

our prayr our tear our loud lament ar vain
urgd by despair again i go to try

what hope remain but what my death must give
can i without so dear a father live
you term it prudenc what i base call
could such a word from such a parent fall
if fortun pleas and so the god ordain
that noth should of ruind troi remain
and you conspir with fortun to be slain
the wai to death is wide th approach near
for soon relentless pyrrhu will appear
reek with priam blood the wretch who slew
the son inhuman in the father view
and then the sire himself to the dire altar drew
o goddess mother give me back to fate
your gift wa undesird and came too late
did you for thi unhappi me convei

armd onc again my glittr sword i wield
while th other hand sustain my weighti shield
and forth i rush to seek th abandond field
i went but sad creusa stoppd my wai
and cross the threshold in my passag lai
embracd my knee and when i would have gone

if death be your design at least said she
take us along to share your destini
if ani farther hope in arm remain
thi place these pledg of your love maintain
to whom do you expos your father life

while thu she fill the hous with clamrou cri
our hear is divert by our ey
for while i held my son in the short space
betwixt our kiss and our last embrac

if ani vow almighti jove can bend

confirm the glad presag which thou art pleasd to send
scarc had he said when on our left we hear
a peal of rattl thunder roll in air
there shot a stream lamp along the sky
which on the wing lightn seemd to fly
from oer the roof the blaze began to move
and trail vanishd in th idaean grove
it swept a path in heavn and shone a guid
then in a steam stench of sulphur di
the good old man with suppliant hand implord

now now said he my son no more delai

and you can yet restor the ruind town
at least accomplish what your sign foreshow
i stand resignd and am prepard to go
he said the crackl flame appear on high
and drive sparkl danc along the sky
with vulcan rage the rise wind conspir
and near our palac roll the flood of fire
hast my dear father ti no time to wait
and load my shoulder with a will freight
whateer befal your life shall be my care
on death or on delivr we will share
my hand shall lead our littl son and you

next you my servant heed my strict command
without the wall a ruind templ stand
to cere hallowd onc a cypress nigh
shoot up her vener head on high
by long religion kept there bend your feet
and in divid parti let us meet
our countri god the relic and the band
hold you my father in your guiltless hand
in me ti impiou holi thing to bear
red as i am with slaughter new from war
till in some live stream i cleans the guilt
of dire debat and blood in battl spilt
thu ordr all that prudenc could provid
i cloth my shoulder with a lion hide
and yellow spoil then on my bend back
the welcom load of my dear father take
while on my better hand ascaniu hung
and with unequ pace trippd along
creusa kept behind by choic we strai
thro evri dark and evri deviou wai
i who so bold and dauntless just befor
the grecian dart and shock of lanc bore
at evri shadow now am seizd with fear
not for myself but for the charg i bear
till near the ruind gate arrivd at last
secur and deem all the danger past
a fright nois of trampl feet we hear
my father look thro the shade with fear
cri out hast hast my son the foe ar nigh
their sword and shine armour i descri
some hostil god for some unknown offenc
had sure bereft my mind of better sens
for while thro wind wai i took my flight
and sought the shelter of the gloomi night
ala i lost creusa hard to tell
if by her fatal destini she fell
or weari sate or wanderd with affright
but she wa lost for ever to my sight
i knew not or reflect till i meet
my friend at cere now desert seat
we met not on wa want onli she
deceivd her friend her son and wretch me
what mad express did my tongu refus
whom did i not of god or men accus
thi wa the fatal blow that paind me more
than all i felt from ruind troi befor
stung with my loss and rave with despair
abandon my now forgotten care
of counsel comfort and of hope bereft
my sire my son my countri god i left
in shine armour onc again i sheath
my limb not feel wound nor fear death
then headlong to the burn wall i run
and seek the danger i wa forcd to shun
i tread my former track thro night explor
each passag evri street i crossd befor
all thing were full of horror and affright
and dread evn the silenc of the night
then to my father hous i make repair
with some small glimps of hope to find her there
instead of her the cruel greek i met
the hous wa filld with foe with flame beset
drivn on the wing of wind whole sheet of fire
thro air transport to the roof aspir
from thenc to priam palac i resort
and search the citadel and desert court
then unobservd i pass by juno church
a guard of grecian had possessd the porch
there phoenix and ulyss watch the prei
and thither all the wealth of troi convei
the spoil which thei from ransackd hous brought
and golden bowl from burn altar caught
the tabl of the god the purpl vest
the peopl treasur and the pomp of priest
a rank of wretch youth with piniond hand
and captiv matron in long order stand
then with ungovernd mad i proclaim
thro all the silent street creusa name
creusa still i call at length she hear
and sudden thro the shade of night appear
appear no more creusa nor my wife
but a pale spectr larger than the life
aghast astonishd and struck dumb with fear
i stood like bristl rose my stiffend hair
then thu the ghost began to sooth my grief
nor tear nor cri can give the dead relief
desist my muchlovd lord t indulg your pain
you bear no more than what the god ordain
my fate permit me not from henc to fly
nor he the great control of the sky
long wandr wai for you the powr decre
on land hard labour and a length of sea
then after mani pain year ar past
on latium happi shore you shall be cast
where gentl tiber from hi bed behold
the flowri meadow and the feed fold
there end your toil and there your fate provid
a quiet kingdom and a royal bride
there fortun shall the trojan line restor
and you for lost creusa weep no more
fear not that i shall watch with servil shame
th imperi look of some proud grecian dame
or stoop to the victor lust disgrac
my goddess mother or my royal race
and now farewel the parent of the god
restrain my fleet soul in her abod
i trust our common issu to your care
she said and glide passd unseen in air
i strove to speak but horror ti my tongu
and thrice about her neck my arm i flung
and thrice deceivd on vain embrac hung
light as an empti dream at break of dai
or as a blast of wind she rushd awai
thu have passd the night in fruitless pain
i to my long friend return again
amazd th augment number to behold
of men and matron mixd of young and old
a wretch exild crew togeth brought
with arm appoint and with treasur fraught
resolvd and will under my command
to run all hazard both of sea and land
the morn began from ida to displai
her rosi cheek and phosphor led the dai
befor the gate the grecian took their post
and all pretenc of late relief wa lost
i yield to fate unwillingli retir
and load up the hill convei my sire

mistak of the oracl answer he settl in crete hi
household god give him the true sens of the oracl in a dream

he is cast on sever shore and meet with veri surpris
adventur till at length he land on sicili where hi father
anchis di thi is the place which he wa sail from when
the tempest rose and threw him upon the carthaginian coast
when heavn had overturnd the trojan state
and priam throne by too sever a fate
when ruind troi becam the grecian prei
and ilium lofti towr in ash lai
warnd by celesti omen we retreat
to seek in foreign land a happier seat
near old antandro and at ida foot
the timber of the sacr grove we cut
and build our fleet uncertain yet to find
what place the god for our repos assignd
friend daili flock and scarc the kindli spring
began to cloth the ground and bird to sing
when old anchis summond all to sea
the crew my father and the fate obei
with sigh and tear i leav my nativ shore
and empti field where ilium stood befor
my sire my son our less and greater god
all sail at onc and cleav the brini flood
against our coast appear a spaciou land
which onc the fierc lycurgu did command
thracia the name the peopl bold in war
vast ar their field and tillag is their care
a hospit realm while fate wa kind
with troi in friendship and religion joind
i land with luckless omen then ador
their god and draw a line along the shore
i lai the deep foundat of a wall
and aeno namd from me the citi call
to dionaean venu vow ar paid
and all the powr that rise labour aid
a bull on jove imperi altar laid
not far a rise hillock stood in view
sharp myrtl on the side and cornel grew
there while i went to crop the sylvan scene
and shade our altar with their leafi green
i pulld a plant with horror i relat
a prodigi so strang and full of fate
the root fiber rose and from the wound
black bloodi drop distilld upon the ground
mute and amazd my hair with terror stood
fear shrunk my sinew and congeald my blood
mannd onc again anoth plant i try
that other gushd with the same sanguin dye
then fear guilt for some offenc unknown
with prayr and vow the dryad i aton
with all the sister of the wood and most
the god of arm who rule the thracian coast
that thei or he these omen would avert
releas our fear and better sign impart
cleard as i thought and fulli fixd at length
to learn the caus i tug with all my strength
i bent my knee against the ground onc more
the violat myrtl ran with gore
scarc dare i tell the sequel from the womb
of wound earth and cavern of the tomb
a groan as of a troubl ghost renewd
my fright and then these dread word ensu
why dost thou thu my buri bodi rend
o spare the corps of thy unhappi friend
spare to pollut thy piou hand with blood
the tear distil not from the wound wood
but evri drop thi live tree contain
is kindr blood and ran in trojan vein
o fly from thi unhospit shore
warnd by my fate for i am polydor
here load of lanc in my blood embru
again shoot upward by my blood renewd
my faltr tongu and shivr limb declar
my horror and in bristl rose my hair
when troi with grecian arm wa close pent
old priam fear of the war event
thi hapless polydor to thracia sent
load with gold he sent hi darl far
from nois and tumult and destruct war
commit to the faithless tyrant care
who when he saw the powr of troi declin
forsook the weaker with the strong to join
broke evri bond of natur and of truth
and murderd for hi wealth the royal youth
o sacr hunger of pernici gold
what band of faith can impiou lucr hold
now when my soul had shaken off her fear
i call my father and the trojan peer
relat the prodigi of heavn requir
what he command and their advic desir
all vote to leav that execr shore
pollut with the blood of polydor
but er we sail hi funral rite prepar
then to hi ghost a tomb and altar rear
in mourn pomp the matron walk the round
with bale cypress and blue fillet crownd
with ey deject and with hair unbound
then bowl of tepid milk and blood we pour
and thrice invok the soul of polydor
now when the rage storm no longer reign
but southern gale invit us to the main
we launch our vessel with a prosprou wind
and leav the citi and the shore behind
an island in th aegaean main appear
neptun and watri dori claim it their

to root earth and now it brave the tide
here born by friendli wind we come ashor
with need eas our weari limb restor
and the sun templ and hi town ador
aniu the priest and king with laurel crownd
hi hoari lock with purpl fillet bound
who saw my sire the delian shore ascend
came forth with eager hast to meet hi friend
invit him to hi palac and in sign
of ancient love their plight hand thei join
then to the templ of the god i went
and thu befor the shrine my vow present
give o thymbraeu give a rest place
to the sad relic of the trojan race
a seat secur a region of their own
a last empir and a happier town
where shall we fix where shall our labour end
whom shall we follow and what fate attend
let not my prayr a doubt answer find
but in clear auguri unveil thy mind
scarc had i said he shook the holi ground
the laurel and the lofti hill around
and from the tripo rushd a bellow sound
prostrat we fell confessd the present god
who gave thi answer from hi dark abod
undaunt youth go seek that mother earth
from which your ancestor deriv their birth
the soil that sent you forth her ancient race
in her old bosom shall again embrac
through the wide world th aeneian hous shall reign
and children children shall the crown sustain
thu phoebu did our futur fate disclos
a mighti tumult mixd with joi aros
all ar concernd to know what place the god
assignd and where determind our abod
my father long revolv in hi mind
the race and lineag of the trojan kind
thu answerd their demand ye princ hear
your pleas fortun and dispel your fear
the fruit isl of crete well known to fame
sacr of old to jove imperi name
in the mid ocean li with larg command
and on it plain a hundr citi stand
anoth ida rise there and we
from thenc deriv our trojan ancestri
from thenc as ti divulgd by certain fame
to the rhoetean shore old teucru came
there fixd and there the seat of empir chose
er ilium and the trojan towr aros
in humbl vale thei built their soft abod
till cybel the mother of the god
with tinkl cymbal charmd th idaean wood
she secret rite and ceremoni taught
and to the yoke the savag lion brought
let us the land which heavn appoint explor
appeas the wind and seek the gnossian shore
if jove assist the passag of our fleet
the third propiti dawn discov crete
thu have said the sacrific laid
on smoke altar to the god he paid
a bull to neptun an oblat due
anoth bull to bright apollo slew
a milkwhit ew the western wind to pleas
and on coalblack to calm the stormi sea
er thi a fly rumour had been spread
that fierc idomeneu from crete wa fled
expelld and exild that the coast wa free
from foreign or domest enemi
we leav the delian port and put to sea
by naxo famd for vintag make our wai
then green donysa pass and sail in sight
of paro isl with marbl quarri white
we pass the scatterd isl of cyclad
that scarc distinguishd seem to stud the sea
the shout of sailor doubl near the shore
thei stretch their canva and thei ply their oar
all hand aloft for crete for crete thei cry
and swiftli thro the foami billow fly
full on the promisd land at length we bore
with joi descend on the cretan shore
with eager hast a rise town i frame
which from the trojan pergamu i name
the name itself wa grate i exhort
to found their hous and erect a fort
our ship ar hauld upon the yellow strand
the youth begin to till the labourd land
and i myself new marriag promot
give law and dwell i divid by lot
when rise vapour choke the wholesom air
and blast of noisom wind corrupt the year
the tree devour caterpillar burn
parchd wa the grass and blight wa the corn
nor scape the beast for siriu from on high
with pestilenti heat infect the sky
my men some fall the rest in fever fry
again my father bid me seek the shore
of sacr delo and the god implor
to learn what end of woe we might expect
and to what clime our weari cours direct
twa night when evri creatur void of care
the common gift of balmi slumber share
the statu of my god for such thei seemd
those god whom i from flame troi redeemd
befor me stood majest bright
full in the beam of phoeb entr light
then thu thei spoke and easd my troubl mind
what from the delian god thou gost to find
he tell thee here and send us to relat
those powr ar we companion of thy fate
who from the burn town by thee were brought
thy fortun followd and thy safeti wrought
thro sea and land as we thy step attend
so shall our care thy gloriou race befriend
an ampl realm for thee thy fate ordain
a town that oer the conquerd world shall reign
thou mighti wall for mighti nation build
nor let thy weari mind to labour yield
but chang thy seat for not the delian god
nor we have givn thee crete for our abod
a land there is hesperia calld of old
the soil is fruit and the nativ bold
th oenotrian held it onc by later fame
now calld italia from the leader name
jasiu there and dardanu were born
from thenc we came and thither must return
rise and thy sire with these glad tide greet
search itali for jove deni thee crete
astonishd at their voic and their sight
nor were thei dream but vision of the night
i saw i knew their face and descri
in perfect view their hair with fillet ti
i start from my couch a clammi sweat
on all my limb and shivr bodi sate
to heavn i lift my hand with piou hast
and sacr incens in the flame i cast
thu to the god their perfect honour done
more cheer to my good old sire i run
and tell the pleas new in littl space
he found hi error of the doubl race
not as befor he deemd derivd from crete
no more delud by the doubt seat
then said o son turmoild in trojan fate
such thing as these cassandra did relat
thi dai reviv within my mind what she
foretold of troi renewd in itali
and latian land but who could then have thought
that phrygian god to latium should be brought
or who believd what mad cassandra taught
now let us go where phoebu lead the wai
he said and we with glad consent obei
forsak the seat and leav few behind
we spread our sail befor the will wind
now from the sight of land our gallei move
with onli sea around and ski abov
when oer our head descend a burst of rain
and night with sabl cloud involv the main
the ruffl wind the foami billow rais
the scatterd fleet is forcd to sevral wai
the face of heavn is ravishd from our ey
and in redoubl peal the roar thunder fli
cast from our cours we wander in the dark
no star to guid no point of land to mark
evn palinuru no distinct found
betwixt the night and dai such dark reignd around
three starless night the doubt navi strai
without distinct and three sunless dai
the fourth renew the light and from our shroud
we view a rise land like distant cloud
the mountaintop confirm the pleas sight
and curl smoke ascend from their height
the canva fall their oar the sailor ply
from the rude stroke the whirl water fly
at length i land upon the strophad
safe from the danger of the stormi sea
those isl ar compassd by th ionian main
the dire abod where the foul harpi reign
forcd by the wing warrior to repair
to their old home and leav their costli fare
monster more fierc offend heavn neer sent
from hell abyss for human punish
with virgin face but with womb obscen
foul paunch and with ordur still unclean
with claw for hand and look for ever lean
we land at the port and soon beheld
fat herd of oxen graze the flowri field
and wanton goat without a keeper strayd
with weapon we the welcom prei invad
then call the god for partner of our feast
and jove himself the chief invit guest
we spread the tabl on the greensward ground
we feed with hunger and the bowl go round
when from the mountaintop with hideou cry
and clattr wing the hungri harpi fly
thei snatch the meat defil all thei find
and part leav a loathsom stench behind
close by a hollow rock again we sit
new dress the dinner and the bed refit
secur from sight beneath a pleas shade
where tuft tree a nativ arbour made
again the holi fire on altar burn
and onc again the ravnou bird return
or from the dark recess where thei lie
or from anoth quarter of the sky
with filthi claw their odiou meal repeat
and mix their loathsom ordur with their meat
i bid my friend for vengeanc then prepar
and with the hellish nation wage the war
thei as command for the fight provid
and in the grass their glittr weapon hide
then when along the crook shore we hear
their clattr wing and saw the foe appear
misenu sound a charg we take th alarm
and our strong hand with sword and buckler arm
in thi new kind of combat all emploi
their utmost forc the monster to destroi
in vain the fate skin is proof to wound
and from their plume the shine sword rebound
at length rebuffd thei leav their mangl prei
and their stretchd pinion to the ski displai
yet on remaind the messeng of fate
high on a craggi cliff celaeno sate
and thu her dismal errand did relat
what not content with our oxen slain
dare you with heavn an impiou war maintain
and drive the harpi from their nativ reign
heed therefor what i sai and keep in mind
what jove decre what phoebu ha designd
and i the furi queen from both relat

but know that er your promisd wall you build

fierc famin is your lot for thi misde
reducd to grind the plate on which you feed
she said and to the neighbr forest flew
our courag fail us and our fear renew
hopeless to win by war to prayr we fall
and on th offend harpi humbl call
and whether god or bird obscen thei were
our vow for pardon and for peac prefer

and curs the land which dire ulyss bore

of mani thing some few i shall explain
teach thee to shun the danger of the main
and how at length the promisd shore to gain
the rest the fate from helenu conceal
and juno angri powr forbid to tell
first then that happi shore that seem so nigh
will far from your delud wish fly
long tract of sea divid your hope from itali
for you must cruis along sicilian shore
and stem the current with your struggl oar
then round th italian coast your navi steer
and after thi to circ island veer
and last befor your new foundat rise
must pass the stygian lake and view the nether ski
now mark the sign of futur eas and rest
and bear them safe treasurd in thy breast
when in the shadi shelter of a wood
and near the margin of a gentl flood
thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground
with thirti suck young encompassd round

these on thy citi shall their name bestow
and there shall end thy labour and thy woe
nor let the threatend famin fright thy mind

and with loud curs leav the mystic shade
think it not loss of time a while to stai
tho thy companion chide thy long delai

if ever i ascend the latian throne
and build a citi i mai call my own
as both of us our birth from troi deriv
so let our kindr line in concord live
and both in act of equal friendship strive
our fortun good or bad shall be the same
the doubl troi shall differ but in name
that what we now begin mai never end
but long to late poster descend
near the ceraunian rock our cours we bore
the shortest passag to th italian shore
now had the sun withdrawn hi radiant light
and hill were hid in duski shade of night
we land and on the bosom of the ground
a safe retreat and a bare lodg found
close by the shore we lai the sailor keep
their watch and the rest secur sleep
the night proceed on with silent pace
stood in her noon and viewd with equal face

then wake palinuru rose to spy

and listend evri breath of air to try
observ the star and note their slide cours
the pleiad hyad and their watri forc
and both the bear is care to behold
and bright orion armd with burnishd gold
then when he saw no threatn tempest nigh
but a sure promis of a settl sky
he gave the sign to weigh we break our sleep
forsak the pleas shore and plow the deep
and now the rise morn with rosi light
adorn the ski and put the star to flight
when we from far like bluish mist descri

for hercul renownd if fame be true
just opposit lacinian juno stand
caulonian towr and scylacaean strand
for shipwreck feard mount aetna thenc we spy
known by the smoki flame which cloud the sky
far off we hear the wave with surli sound
invad the rock the rock their groan rebound
the billow break upon the sound strand
and roll the rise tide impur with sand
then thu anchis in experi old

and those the promisd rock bear off to sea
with hast the fright marin obei
first palinuru to the larboard veerd
then all the fleet by hi exampl steerd
to heavn aloft on ridgi wave we ride
then down to hell descend when thei divid
and thrice our gallei knockd the stoni ground
and thrice the hollow rock returnd the sound
and thrice we saw the star that stood with dew around
the flag wind forsook us with the sun
and weari on cyclopian shore we run
the port capaci and secur from wind
is to the foot of thundr aetna joind
by turn a pitchi cloud she roll on high
by turn hot ember from her entrail fly
and flake of mount flame that lick the sky
oft from her bowel massi rock ar thrown
and shiverd by the forc come piecem down
oft liquid lake of burn sulphur flow
fed from the fieri spring that boil below
enceladu thei sai transfixd by jove
with blast limb came tumbl from abov
and where he fell th aveng father drew
thi flame hill and on hi bodi threw
as often as he turn hi weari side
he shake the solid isl and smoke the heaven hide
in shadi wood we pass the tediou night
where bellow sound and groan our soul affright
of which no caus is offerd to the sight
for not on star wa kindl in the sky
nor could the moon her borrowd light suppli
for misti cloud involvd the firmament
the star were muffl and the moon wa pent
scarc had the rise sun the dai reveald
scarc had hi heat the pearli dew dispelld
when from the wood there bolt befor our sight
somewhat betwixt a mortal and a sprite
so thin so ghastli meager and so wan
so bare of flesh he scarc resembl man
thi thing all tatterd seemd from far timplor
our piou aid and point to the shore
we look behind then view hi shaggi beard
hi cloth were taggd with thorn and filth hi limb

appeard a greek and such inde he wa
he cast on us from far a fright view
whom soon for trojan and for foe he knew
stood still and pausd then all at onc began
to stretch hi limb and trembl as he ran
soon as approachd upon hi knee he fall
and thu with tear and sigh for piti call
now by the powr abov and what we share
from natur common gift thi vital air
o trojan take me henc i beg no more
but bear me far from thi unhappi shore
ti true i am a greek and farther own
among your foe besiegd th imperi town
for such demerit if my death be due
no more for thi abandond life i sue
thi onli favour let my tear obtain
to throw me headlong in the rapid main
sinc noth more than death my crime demand
i die content to die by human hand
he said and on hi knee my knee embracd
i bade him boldli tell hi fortun past
hi present state hi lineag and hi name
th occas of hi fear and whenc he came
the good anchis raisd him with hi hand
who thu encouragd answerd our demand
from ithaca my nativ soil i came
to troi and achaemenid my name
me my poor father with ulyss sent
o had i stayd with poverti content
but fear for themselv my countrymen
left me forsaken in the cyclop den
the cave tho larg wa dark the dismal floor
wa pavd with mangl limb and putrid gore
our monstrou host of more than human size
erect hi head and stare within the ski
bellow hi voic and horrid is hi hue
ye god remov thi plagu from mortal view
the joint of slaughterd wretch ar hi food
and for hi wine he quaff the stream blood
these ey beheld when with hi spaciou hand
he seizd two captiv of our grecian band
stretchd on hi back he dashd against the stone
their broken bodi and their crackl bone
with spout blood the purpl pavement swim
while the dire glutton grind the trembl limb
not unrevengd ulyss bore their fate
nor thoughtless of hi own unhappi state
for gorgd with flesh and drunk with human wine
while fast asleep the giant lai supin
snore aloud and belch from hi maw
hi indigest foam and morsel raw
we prai we cast the lot and then surround
the monstrou bodi stretchd along the ground
each as he could approach him lend a hand
to bore hi eyebal with a flame brand
beneath hi frown forehead lai hi ey
for onli on did the vast frame suppli
but that a globe so larg hi front it filld
like the sun disk or like a grecian shield
the stroke succe and down the pupil bend
thi vengeanc followd for our slaughterd friend
but hast unhappi wretch hast to fly
your cabl cut and on your oar reli
such and so vast as polyphem appear
a hundr more thi hate island bear
like him in cave thei shut their woolli sheep
like him their herd on top of mountain keep
like him with mighti stride thei stalk from steep to steep
and now three moon their sharpend horn renew
sinc thu in wood and wild obscur from view
i drag my loathsom dai with mortal fright
and in desert cavern lodg by night
oft from the rock a dread prospect see
of the huge cyclop like a walk tree
from far i hear hi thundr voic resound
and trampl feet that shake the solid ground
cornel and salvag berri of the wood
and root and herb have been my meager food
while all around my long ey i cast
i saw your happi ship appear at last
on those i fixd my hope to these i run
ti all i ask thi cruel race to shun
what other death you pleas yourselv bestow
scarc had he said when on the mountain brow
we saw the giant shepherd stalk befor
hi follow flock and lead to the shore
a monstrou bulk deformd deprivd of sight
hi staff a trunk of pine to guid hi step aright
hi pondrou whistl from hi neck descend
hi woolli care their pensiv lord attend
thi onli solac hi hard fortun send
soon as he reachd the shore and touchd the wave
from hi bord ey the guttr blood he lave
he gnashd hi teeth and groand thro sea he stride
and scarc the topmost billow touchd hi side
seizd with a sudden fear we run to sea
the cabl cut and silent hast awai
the welldeserv stranger entertain
then buckl to the work our oar divid the main
the giant harkend to the dash sound
but when our vessel out of reach he found
he stride onward and in vain essayd
th ionian deep and durst no farther wade
with that he roard aloud the dread cry
shake earth and air and sea the billow fly
befor the bellow nois to distant itali
the neighbr aetna trembl all around
the wind cavern echo to the sound
hi brother cyclop hear the yell roar
and rush down the mountain crowd the shore
we saw their stern distort look from far
and oneei glanc that vainli threatend war
a dread council with their head on high
the misti cloud about their forehead fly
not yield to the towr tree of jove
or tallest cypress of diana grove
new pang of mortal fear our mind assail
we tug at evri oar and hoist up evri sail
and take th advantag of the friendli gale
forewarnd by helenu we strive to shun
charybdi gulf nor dare to scylla run
an equal fate on either side appear
we tack to the left ar free from fear
for from peloru point the north aros
and drove us back where swift pantagia flow
hi rocki mouth we pass and make our wai

diana name protectress of the shore
with prosprou gale we pass the quiet sound
of still eloru and hi fruit bound
then doubl cape pachynu we survei
the rocki shore extend to the sea
the town of camarin from far we see
and fenni lake undraind by fate decre
in sight of the geloan field we pass
and the larg wall where mighti gela wa
then agraga with lofti summit crownd
long for the race of warlik steed renownd
we passd selinu and the palmi land
and wide shun the lilybaean strand

and to confess my frailti to my shame
somewhat i find within if not the same

but first let yawn earth a passag rend
and let me thro the dark abyss descend
first let aveng jove with flame from high
drive down thi bodi to the nether sky
condemnd with ghost in endless night to lie
befor i break the plight faith i gave
no he who had my vow shall ever have
for whom i lovd on earth i worship in the grave
she said the tear ran gush from her ey

o dearer than the vital air i breath
will you to grief your bloom year bequeath
condemnd to wast in woe your lone life
without the joi of mother or of wife

i grant that while your sorrow yet were green
it well becam a woman and a queen
the vow of tyrian princ to neglect
to scorn hyarba and hi love reject
with all the libyan lord of mighti name
but will you fight against a pleas flame
thi littl spot of land which heavn bestow
on evri side is hemmd with warlik foe
gaetulian citi here ar spread around
and fierc numidian there your frontier bound

how will your empir spread your citi rise

implor the favour of the powr abov
and leav the conduct of the rest to love
continu still your hospit wai
and still invent occas of their stai
till storm and winter wind shall ceas to threat
and plank and oar repair their shatterd fleet
these word which from a friend and sister came
with eas resolvd the scrupl of her fame

the beauteou queen befor her altar stand
and hold the golden goblet in her hand

and pour the ruddi wine betwixt her horn
and while the priest with prayr the god invok
she feed their altar with sabaean smoke
with hourli care the sacrific renew
and anxious the pant entrail view
what priestli rite ala what piou art
what vow avail to cure a bleed heart
a gentl fire she feed within her vein
where the soft god secur in silenc reign
sick with desir and seek him she love
from street to street the rave dido rove
so when the watch shepherd from the blind
wound with a random shaft the careless hind
distract with her pain she fli the wood
bound oer the lawn and seek the silent flood
with fruitless care for still the fatal dart
stick in her side and rankl in her heart
and now she lead the trojan chief along
the lofti wall amidst the busi throng
displai her tyrian wealth and rise town
which love without hi labour make hi own
thi pomp she show to tempt her wandr guest
her faltr tongu forbid to speak the rest
when dai declin and feast renew the night
still on hi face she feed her famishd sight
she long again to hear the princ relat
hi own adventur and the trojan fate
he tell it oer and oer but still in vain
for still she beg to hear it onc again
the hearer on the speaker mouth depend
and thu the tragic stori never end
then when thei part when phoeb paler light
withdraw and fall star to sleep invit
she last remain when evri guest is gone
sit on the bed he pressd and sigh alon
absent her absent hero see and hear
or in her bosom young ascaniu bear
and seek the father imag in the child
if love by like might be so beguild
meantim the rise towr ar at a stand
no labour exercis the youth band
nor us of art nor toil of arm thei know
the mole is left unfinishd to the foe
the mound the work the wall neglect lie
short of their promisd heighth that seemd to threat the sky
but when imperi juno from abov

if you to bless the nuptial will be there
so shall their love be crownd with due delight
and hymen shall be present at the rite

then young ascaniu with a sprightli grace
lead on the trojan youth to view the chase
but far abov the rest in beauti shine

and grudg the roman their immort name
what ar hi vain design what hope he more
from hi long lingr on a hostil shore

and priam ruind palac to restor
but now the delphian oracl command
and fate invit me to the latian land
that is the promisd place to which i steer
and all my vow ar termin there
if you a tyrian and a stranger born
with wall and towr a libyan town adorn
why mai not we like you a foreign race
like you seek shelter in a foreign place
as often as the night obscur the ski
with humid shade or twinkl star aris
anchis angri ghost in dream appear
chide my delai and fill my soul with fear
and young ascaniu justli mai complain
of hi defraud and destind reign
evn now the herald of the god appeard
wake i saw him and hi messag heard
from jove he came commissiond heavnli bright
with radiant beam and manifest to sight
the sender and the sent i both attest
these wall he enterd and those word expressd
fair queen oppos not what the god command
forcd by my fate i leav your happi land
thu while he spoke alreadi she began
with sparkl ey to view the guilti man
from head to foot surveyd hi person oer
nor longer these outrag threat forebor
fals as thou art and more than fals forsworn
not sprung from nobl blood nor goddessborn
but hewn from hardend entrail of a rock
and rough hyrcanian tiger gave thee suck
why should i fawn what have i wors to fear
did he onc look or lent a listn ear
sighd when i sobbd or shed on kindli tear
all symptom of a base ungrat mind
so foul that which is wors ti hard to find
of man injustic why should i complain
the god and jove himself behold in vain
triumphant treason yet no thunder fli
nor juno view my wrong with equal ey
faithless is earth and faithless ar the ski
justic is fled and truth is now no more
i savd the shipwreckd exil on my shore
with need food hi hungri trojan fed
i took the traitor to my throne and bed
fool that i wa ti littl to repeat
the rest i stord and riggd hi ruind fleet
i rave i rave a god command he plead
and make heavn accessari to hi deed
now lycian lot and now the delian god
now herm is employd from jove abod
to warn him henc as if the peac state
of heavnli powr were touchd with human fate
but go thy flight no longer i detain
go seek thy promisd kingdom thro the main
yet if the heavn will hear my piou vow
the faithless wave not half so fals as thou
or secret sand shall sepulch afford
to thy proud vessel and their perjurd lord
then shalt thou call on injurd dido name
dido shall come in a black sulphri flame
when death ha onc dissolvd her mortal frame
shall smile to see the traitor vainli weep
her angri ghost aris from the deep
shall haunt thee wake and disturb thy sleep
at least my shade thy punish shall know
and fame shall spread the pleas new below
abruptli here she stop then turn awai
her loath ey and shun the sight of dai
amazd he stood revolv in hi mind
what speech to frame and what excus to find
her fear maid their faint mistress led
and softli laid her on her ivori bed
but good aenea tho he much desird
to give that piti which her grief requird
tho much he mournd and labourd with hi love
resolvd at length obei the will of jove
review hi forc thei with earli care
unmoor their vessel and for sea prepar
the fleet is soon afloat in all it pride
and wellcalkd gallei in the harbour ride
then oak for oar thei felld or as thei stood
of it green arm despoild the grow wood
studiou of flight the beach is coverd oer
with trojan band that blacken all the shore
on evri side ar seen descend down
thick swarm of soldier loaden from the town
thu in battalia march embodi ant
fear of winter and of futur want
t invad the corn and to their cell convei
the plunderd forag of their yellow prei
the sabl troop along the narrow track
scarc bear the weighti burthen on their back
some set their shoulder to the pondrou grain
some guard the spoil some lash the lag train
all ply their sevral task and equal toil sustain
what pang the tender breast of dido tore
when from the towr she saw the coverd shore
and heard the shout of sailor from afar
mixd with the murmur of the watri war
allpowr love what chang canst thou caus
in human heart subject to thy law
onc more her haughti soul the tyrant bend
to prayr and mean submiss she descend
no femal art or aid she left untri
nor counsel unexplord befor she di
look anna look the trojan crowd to sea
thei spread their canva and their anchor weigh
the shout crew their ship with garland bind
invok the sea god and invit the wind
could i have thought thi threatn blow so near
my tender soul had been forewarnd to bear
but do not you my last request deni
with yon perfidi man your intrest try
and bring me new if i must live or die
you ar hi favrit you alon can find
the dark recess of hi inmost mind
in all hi trust secret you have part
and know the soft approach to hi heart
hast then and humbl seek my haughti foe
tell him i did not with the grecian go
nor did my fleet against hi friend emploi
nor swore the ruin of unhappi troi
nor movd with hand profan hi father dust
why should he then reject a suit so just
whom doe he shun and whither would he fly
can he thi last thi onli prayr deni
let him at least hi dangrou flight delai
wait better wind and hope a calmer sea
the nuptial he disclaim i urg no more
let him pursu the promisd latian shore
a short delai is all i ask him now
a paus of grief an interv from woe
till my soft soul be temperd to sustain
accustomd sorrow and inurd to pain
if you in piti grant thi on request
my death shall glut the hatr of hi breast
thi mourn messag piou anna bear
and second with her own her sister tear
but all her art ar still employd in vain
again she come and is refusd again
hi hardend heart nor prayr nor threatn move
fate and the god had stoppd hi ear to love
as when the wind their airi quarrel try
justl from evri quarter of the sky
thi wai and that the mountain oak thei bend
hi bough thei shatter and hi branch rend
with leav and fall mast thei spread the ground
the hollow vallei echo to the sound
unmovd the royal plant their furi mock
or shaken cling more close to the rock
far as he shoot hi towr head on high
so deep in earth hi fixd foundat lie
no less a storm the trojan hero bear
thick messag and loud complaint he hear
and bandi word still beat on hi ear
sigh groan and tear proclaim hi inward pain
but the firm purpos of hi heart remain
the wretch queen pursu by cruel fate
begin at length the light of heavn to hate
and loath to live then dire portent she see
to hasten on the death her soul decre
strang to relat for when befor the shrine
she pour in sacrific the purpl wine
the purpl wine is turnd to putrid blood
and the white offerd milk convert to mud
thi dire presag to her alon reveald
from all and evn her sister she conceald
a marbl templ stood within the grove
sacr to death and to her murderd love
that honourd chapel she had hung around
with snowi fleec and with garland crownd
oft when she visit thi lone dome
strang voic issu from her husband tomb
she thought she heard him summon her awai
invit her to hi grave and chide her stai
hourli ti heard when with a bode note
the solitari screech owl strain her throat
and on a chimnei top or turret height
with song obscen disturb the silenc of the night
besid old propheci augment her fear
and stern aenea in her dream appear
disdain as by dai she seem alon
to wander in her sleep thro wai unknown
guideless and dark or in a desert plain
to seek her subject and to seek in vain
like pentheu when distract with hi fear
he saw two sun and doubl thebe appear
or mad orest when hi mother ghost
full in hi face infern torch tossd
and shook her snaki lock he shun the sight
fli oer the stage surprisd with mortal fright
the furi guard the door and intercept hi flight
now sink underneath a load of grief
from death alon she seek her last relief
the time and mean resolvd within her breast
she to her mourn sister thu addressd
dissembl hope her cloudi front she clear
and a fals vigour in her ey appear
rejoic she said instruct from abov
my lover i shall gain or lose my love
nigh rise atla next the fall sun
long tract of ethiopian climat run
there a massylian priestess i have found
honourd for ag for magic art renownd

she poppi seed in honei taught to steep
reclaimd hi rage and soothd him into sleep
she watchd the golden fruit her charm unbind
the chain of love or fix them on the mind
she stop the torrent leav the channel dry
repel the star and backward bear the sky
the yawn earth rebellow to her call
pale ghost ascend and mountain ash fall
wit ye god and thou my better part
how loth i am to try thi impiou art
within the secret court with silent care
erect a lofti pile exposd in air
hang on the topmost part the trojan vest

next under these the bridal bed be placd
where i my ruin in hi arm embracd
all relic of the wretch ar doomd to fire
for so the priestess and her charm requir
thu far she said and farther speech forbear
a mortal pale in her face appear
yet the mistrustless anna could not find
the secret funral in these rite designd
nor thought so dire a rage possessd her mind
unknow of a train conceald so well
she feard no wors than when sichaeu fell
therefor obei the fatal pile thei rear

the cloven holm and pine ar heapd on high
and garland on the hollow space lie
sad cypress vervain yew compos the wreath
and evri bale green denot death

and evri powr if ani rule abov
who mind or who reveng injurd love

and peac with downi wing wa brood on the ground

unhappi dido wa alon awak
nor sleep nor eas the furiou queen can find
sleep fled her ey as quiet fled her mind
despair and rage and love divid her heart
despair and rage had some but love the greater part
then thu she said within her secret mind
what shall i do what succour can i find
becom a suppliant to hyarba pride
and take my turn to court and be deni
shall i with thi ungrat trojan go
forsak an empir and attend a foe
himself i refugd and hi train relievd
ti true but am i sure to be receivd
can gratitud in trojan soul have place
laomedon still live in all hi race
then shall i seek alon the churlish crew
or with my fleet their fly sail pursu
what forc have i but those whom scarc befor
i drew reluct from their nativ shore
will thei again embark at my desir
onc more sustain the sea and quit their second tyre
rather with steel thy guilti breast invad
and take the fortun thou thyself hast made
your piti sister first seducd my mind
or second too well what i designd
these dearbought pleasur had i never known
had i continu free and still my own
avoid love i had not found despair
but shard with salvag beast the common air
like them a lone life i might have led
not mournd the live nor disturbd the dead
these thought she brood in her anxiou breast
on board the trojan found more easi rest
resolvd to sail in sleep he passd the night
and orderd all thing for hi earli flight
to whom onc more the wing god appear
hi former youth mien and shape he wear
and with thi new alarm invad hi ear
sleepst thou o goddessborn and canst thou drown
thy need care so near a hostil town
beset with foe nor hearst the western gale
invit thy passag and inspir thy sail
she harbour in her heart a furiou hate
and thou shalt find the dire effect too late
fixd on reveng and obstin to die
hast swiftli henc while thou hast powr to fly
the sea with ship will soon be coverd oer
and blaze firebrand kindl all the shore
prevent her rage while night obscur the ski
and sail befor the purpl morn aris
who know what hazard thy delai mai bring
woman a variou and a chang thing
thu herm in the dream then took hi flight
aloft in air unseen and mixd with night
twice warnd by the celesti messeng
the piou princ aros with hasti fear
then rousd hi drowsi train without delai
hast to your bank your crook anchor weigh
and spread your fly sail and stand to sea
a god command he stood befor my sight
and urgd us onc again to speedi flight
o sacr powr what powr soeer thou art

and prosper the design thy will command
he said and draw forth hi flame sword
hi thundr arm divid the manytwist cord

thei run thei snatch thei rush into the main
with headlong hast thei leav the desert shore
and brush the liquid sea with labr oar
aurora now had left her saffron bed
and beam of earli light the heavn oerspread
when from a towr the queen with wake ey
saw dai point upward from the rosi ski
she lookd to seaward but the sea wa void
and scarc in ken the sail ship descri
stung with despit and furiou with despair
she struck her trembl breast and tore her hair
and shall th ungrat traitor go she said
my land forsaken and my love betrayd
shall we not arm not rush from evri street
to follow sink and burn hi perjurd fleet
hast haul my gallei out pursu the foe
bring flame brand set sail and swiftli row
what have i said where am i furi turn
my brain and my distemperd bosom burn
then when i gave my person and my throne
thi hate thi rage had been more time shown
see now the promisd faith the vaunt name
the piou man who rush thro the flame
preservd hi god and to the phrygian shore
the burthen of hi feebl father bore
i should have torn him piecem strowd in flood
hi scatterd limb or left exposd in wood
destroyd hi friend and son and from the fire
have set the reek boi befor the sire
event ar doubt which on battl wait
yet where the doubt to soul secur of fate
my tyrian at their injurd queen command
had tossd their fire amid the trojan band
at onc extinguishd all the faithless name
and i myself in vengeanc of my shame
had falln upon the pile to mend the funral flame
thou sun who viewst at onc the world below
thou juno guardian of the nuptial vow
thou hecat hearken from thy dark abod
ye furi fiend and violat god
all powr invokd with dido dy breath
attend her curs and aveng her death
if so the fate ordain jove command
th ungrat wretch should find the latian land
yet let a race untamd and haughti foe
hi peac entranc with dire arm oppos
oppressd with number in th unequ field
hi men discouragd and himself expelld
let him for succour sue from place to place
torn from hi subject and hi son embrac
first let him see hi friend in battl slain
and their untim fate lament in vain
and when at length the cruel war shall ceas
on hard condit mai he bui hi peac
nor let him then enjoi suprem command
but fall untim by some hostil hand
and lie unburi on the barren sand
these ar my prayr and thi my dy will
and you my tyrian evri curs fulfil
perpetu hate and mortal war proclaim
against the princ the peopl and the name
these grate offr on my grave bestow
nor leagu nor love the hostil nation know
now and from henc in evri futur ag
when rage excit your arm and strength suppli the rage
rise some aveng of our libyan blood
with fire and sword pursu the perjurd brood

and the same hate descend on all our heir
thi said within her anxiou mind she weigh
the mean of cut short her odiou dai
then to sichaeu nurs she briefli said
for when she left her countri her wa dead
go barc call my sister let her care
the solemn rite of sacrific prepar
the sheep and all th aton offr bring
sprinkl her bodi from the crystal spring
with live drop then let her come and thou
with sacr fillet bind thy hoari brow
thu will i pai my vow to stygian jove
and end the care of my disastr love
then cast the trojan imag on the fire
and as that burn my passion shall expir
the nurs move onward with offici care
and all the speed her ag limb can bear
but furiou dido with dark thought involvd
shook at the mighti mischief she resolvd
with livid spot distinguishd wa her face
red were her roll ey and discomposd her pace
ghastli she gazd with pain she drew her breath
and natur shiverd at approach death
then swiftli to the fatal place she passd
and mount the funral pile with furiou hast
unsheath the sword the trojan left behind
not for so dire an enterpris designd
but when she viewd the garment loos spread
which onc he wore and saw the consciou bed
she pausd and with a sigh the robe embracd
then on the couch her trembl bodi cast
repressd the readi tear and spoke her last
dear pledg of my love while heavn so pleasd
receiv a soul of mortal anguish easd
my fatal cours is finishd and i go
a gloriou name among the ghost below
a lofti citi by my hand is raisd
pygmalion punishd and my lord appeasd
what could my fortun have afford more
had the fals trojan never touchd my shore
then kissd the couch and must i die she said
and unrevengd ti doubli to be dead
yet evn thi death with pleasur i receiv
on ani term ti better than to live
these flame from far mai the fals trojan view
these bode omen hi base flight pursu
she said and struck deep enterd in her side
the pierc steel with reek purpl dy
cloggd in the wound the cruel weapon stand
the spout blood came stream on her hand
her sad attend saw the deadli stroke
and with loud cri the sound palac shook
distract from the fatal sight thei fled
and thro the town the dismal rumour spread
first from the fright court the yell began
redoubl thenc from hous to hous it ran
the groan of men with shriek lament and cri
of mix women mount the vault ski
not less the clamour than if ancient tyre
or the new carthag set by foe on fire

her sister hear and furiou with despair
she beat her breast and rend her yellow hair
and call on eliza name aloud
run breathless to the place and break the crowd
wa all that pomp of woe for thi prepard
these fire thi funral pile these altar reard
wa all thi train of plot contrivd said she
all onli to deceiv unhappi me
which is the worst didst thou in death pretend
to scorn thy sister or delud thy friend
thy summond sister and thy friend had come
on sword had servd us both on common tomb
wa i to rais the pile the powr invok
not to be present at the fatal stroke
at onc thou hast destroyd thyself and me

bring water bath the wound while i in death
lai close my lip to her and catch the fly breath
thi said she mount the pile with eager hast
and in her arm the gasp queen embracd
her templ chafd and her own garment tore
to stanch the stream blood and cleans the gore
thrice dido tri to rais her droop head
and faint thrice fell grovl on the bed
thrice opd her heavi ey and sought the light
but have found it sickend at the sight
and closd her lid at last in endless night
then juno griev that she should sustain
a death so lingr and so full of pain
sent iri down to free her from the strife
of labr natur and dissolv her life
for sinc she di not doomd by heavn decre
or her own crime but human casualti
and rage of love that plungd her in despair
the sister had not cut the topmost hair
which proserpin and thei can onli know
nor made her sacr to the shade below
downward the variou goddess took her flight
and drew a thousand colour from the light
then stood abov the dy lover head
and said i thu devot thee to the dead
thi offr to th infern god i bear
thu while she spoke she cut the fatal hair
the struggl soul wa loosd and life dissolvd in air

but hi oermast gallei checkd hi hast
the centaur and the dolphin brush the brine
with equal oar advanc in a line
and now the mighti centaur seem to lead
and now the speedi dolphin get ahead
now board to board the rival vessel row
the billow lave the ski and ocean groan below
thei reachd the mark proud gya and hi train
in triumph rode the victor of the main
but steer round he chargd hi pilot stand
more close to shore and skim along the sand
let other bear to sea menoet heard
but secret shelv too cautious he feard
and fear sought the deep and still aloof he steerd
with louder cri the captain calld again
bear to the rocki shore and shun the main
he spoke and speak at hi stern he saw
the bold cloanthu near the shelv draw
betwixt the mark and him the scylla stood
and in a closer compass plowd the flood
he passd the mark and wheel got befor
gya blasphemd the god devoutli swore
cri out for anger and hi hair he tore
mindless of other live so high wa grown

the trembl dotard to the deck he drew
then hoist up and overboard he threw
thi done he seizd the helm hi fellow cheerd
turnd short upon the shelf and madli steerd
hardli hi head the plung pilot rear
cloggd with hi cloth and cumberd with hi year
now drop wet he climb the cliff with pain
the crowd that saw him fall and float again
shout from the distant shore and loudli laughd
to see hi heav breast disgorg the brini draught
the follow centaur and the dolphin crew
their vanishd hope of victori renew
while gya lag thei kindl in the race

my friend and hector follow heretofor
exert your vigour tug the labr oar

whom from the flame wall of troi i drew
in thi our common intrest let me find
that strength of hand that courag of the mind
as when you stemmd the strong malean flood
and oer the syrt broken billow rowd
i seek not now the foremost palm to gain

let those enjoi it whom the god ordain
but to be last the lag of all the race
redeem yourselv and me from that disgrac

chanc aid their dare with unhopd success
sergesthu eager with hi beak to press
betwixt the rival gallei and the rock
shut up th unwieldli centaur in the lock
the vessel struck and with the dread shock
her oar she shiverd and her head she broke
the trembl rower from their bank aris
and anxiou for themselv renounc the prize
with iron pole thei heav her off the shore
and gather from the sea their float oar
the crew of mnestheu with elat mind
urg their success and call the will wind
then ply their oar and cut their liquid wai
in larger compass on the roomi sea
as when the dove her rocki hold forsak
rousd in a fright her sound wing she shake
the cavern ring with clattr out she fli
and leav her callow care and cleav the ski
at first she flutter but at length she spring
to smoother flight and shoot upon her wing
so mnestheu in the dolphin cut the sea
and fly with a forc that forc assist hi wai
sergesthu in the centaur soon he passd
wedgd in the rocki shoal and stick fast

shout wish and applaus run rattl thro the ski
these clamour with disdain the scylla heard
much grudgd the prais but more the robbd reward

all obstin to die or gain the race
raisd with success the dolphin swiftli ran
for thei can conquer who believ thei can

yet fierc abov she brandish her tongu

receiv my counsel in the neighbr grove
there stand a tree the queen of stygian jove
claim it her own thick wood and gloomi night
conceal the happi plant from human sight

and the same metal the same room suppli
look round the wood with lift ey to see

then rend it off as holi rite command
the will metal will obei thy hand
follow with eas if favourd by thy fate
thou art foredoomd to view the stygian state
if not no labour can the tree constrain
and strength of stubborn arm and steel ar vain
besid you know not while you here attend

two sabl sheep around hi hears be led
then live turf upon hi bodi lai

to find the region destitut of dai
she said and held her peac aenea went
sad from the cave and full of discont
unknow whom the sacr sibyl meant
achat the companion of hi breast
goe griev by hi side with equal care oppressd
walk thei talkd and fruitlessli divind
what friend the priestess by those word designd
but soon thei found an object to deplor
misenu lai extend on the shore
son of the god of wind none so renownd
the warrior trumpet in the field to sound
with breath brass to kindl fierc alarm
and rous to dare their fate in honour arm
he servd great hector and wa ever near
not with hi trumpet onli but hi spear
but by pelid arm when hector fell
he chose aenea and he chose as well
swoln with applaus and aim still at more
he now provok the sea god from the shore
with envi triton heard the martial sound
and the bold champion for hi challeng drownd
then cast hi mangl carcass on the strand
the gaze crowd around the bodi stand
all weep but most aenea mourn hi fate
and hasten to perform the funer state
in altarwis a state pile thei rear

an ancient wood fit for the work designd
the shadi covert of the salvag kind

fir pine and pitch tree and the towr pride

and pierc wedg cleav the stubborn oak
huge trunk of tree felld from the steepi crown
of the bare mountain roll with ruin down
armd like the rest the trojan princ appear
and by hi piou labour urg their

the wai to compass what hi wish designd
he cast hi ey upon the gloomi grove
and then with vow implord the queen of love
o mai thy powr propiti still to me
conduct my step to find the fatal tree
in thi deep forest sinc the sibyl breath
foretold ala too true misenu death
scarc had he said when full befor hi sight
two dove descend from their airi flight
secur upon the grassi plain alight
he knew hi mother bird and thu he prayd
be you my guid with your auspici aid
and lead my footstep till the branch be found
whose glittr shadow gild the sacr ground
and thou great parent with celesti care
in thi distress be present to my prayr
thu have said he stoppd with watch sight
observ still the motion of their flight
what cours thei took what happi sign thei shew
thei fed and fluttr by degre withdrew
still farther from the place but still in view
hop and fly thu thei led him on
to the slow lake whose bale stench to shun
thei wingd their flight aloft then stoop low
perchd on the doubl tree that bear the golden bough
thro the green leaf the glittr shadow glow
as on the sacr oak the wintri mistleto
where the proud mother view her preciou brood
and happier branch which she never sowd
such wa the glittr such the ruddi rind
and danc leav that wantond in the wind
he seizd the shine bough with gripe hold
and rent awai with eas the lingr gold
then to the sibyl palac bore the prize
meantim the trojan troop with weep ey

and last the relic by themselv dispos
which in a brazen urn the priest inclos
old corynaeu compassd thrice the crew
and dippd an oliv branch in holi dew
which thrice he sprinkl round and thrice aloud
invokd the dead and then dismiss the crowd
but good aenea orderd on the shore
a state tomb whose top a trumpet bore
a soldier falchion and a seaman oar

ye realm yet unreveald to human sight
ye god who rule the region of the night
ye glide ghost permit me to relat
the mystic wonder of your silent state
obscur thei went thro dreari shade that led
along the wast dominion of the dead
thu wander travel in wood by night
by the moon doubt and malign light
when jove in duski cloud involv the ski
and the faint crescent shoot by fit befor their ey
just in the gate and in the jaw of hell

a youth vigour and autumn green
an airi crowd came rush where he stood
which filld the margin of the fatal flood

with hollow groan and shriek and feebl cri
thick as the leav in autumn strow the wood

and wing their hasti flight to happier land
such and so thick the shivr armi stand
and press for passag with extend hand
now these now those the surli boatman bore
the rest he drove to distanc from the shore
the hero who beheld with wondr ey
the tumult mixd with shriek lament and cri
askd of hi guid what the rude concours meant
why to the shore the throng peopl bent
what form of law among the ghost were usd
why some were ferri oer and some refusd

attest in oath and fear to violat
the ghost reject ar th unhappi crew
deprivd of sepulch and funral due
the boatman charon those the buri host

nor dare hi transport vessel cross the wave
with such whose bone ar not composd in grave
a hundr year thei wander on the shore
at length their penanc done ar waft oer
the trojan chief hi forward pace repressd
revolv anxiou thought within hi breast
he saw hi friend who whelmd beneath the wave
their funral honour claimd and askd their quiet grave
the lost leucaspi in the crowd he knew
and the brave leader of the lycian crew
whom on the tyrrhen sea the tempest met
the sailor masterd and the ship oerset
amidst the spirit palinuru pressd
yet fresh from life a newadmit guest
who while he steer viewd the star and bore
hi cours from afric to the latian shore
fell headlong down the trojan fixd hi view
and scarc thro the gloom the sullen shadow knew
then thu the princ what enviou powr o friend
brought your lovd life to thi disastr end
for phoebu ever true in all he said
ha in your fate alon my faith betrayd
the god foretold you should not die befor

is thi th uner powr the ghost repli
nor phoebu flatterd nor hi answer li
nor enviou god have sent me to the deep
but while the star and cours of heavn i keep
my weari ey were seizd with fatal sleep
i fell and with my weight the helm constraind
wa drawn along which yet my gripe retaind
now by the wind and rage wave i swear
your safeti more than mine wa then my care
lest of the guid bereft the rudder lost
your ship should run against the rocki coast
three blustr night born by the southern blast

high on a mount wave my head i bore

and now by wind and wave my lifeless limb ar tossd
which o avert by yon ether light
which i have lost for thi etern night
or if by dearer ti you mai be won
by your dead sire and by your live son
redeem from thi reproach my wandr ghost
or with your navi seek the velin coast
and in a peac grave my corps compos
or if a nearer wai your mother show
without whose aid you durst not undertak
thi fright passag oer the stygian lake
lend to thi wretch your hand and waft him oer
to the sweet bank of yon forbidden shore
scarc had he said the prophetess began
what hope delud thee miser man
thinkst thou thu unintombd to cross the flood
to view the furi and infern god
and visit without leav the dark abod

and pleasd to hear hi propag name

whom from the shore the surli boatman saw
observd their passag thro the shadi wood
and markd their near approach to the flood
then thu he calld aloud inflamd with wrath
mortal whateer who thi forbidden path
in arm presumst to tread i charg thee stand

and from th immort god their lineag came

two sought by forc to seiz hi beauteou bride
to whom the sibyl thu compos thy mind
nor fraud ar here contrivd nor forc designd
still mai the dog the wandr troop constrain
of airi ghost and vex the guilti train
and with her grisli lord hi love queen remain
the trojan chief whose lineag is from jove
much famd for arm and more for filial love
is sent to seek hi sire in your elysian grove
if neither pieti nor heavn command
can gain hi passag to the stygian strand
thi fatal present shall prevail at least
then shewd the shine bough conceald within her vest
no more wa need for the gloomi god
stood mute with aw to see the golden rod
admird the destind offr to hi queen
a vener gift so rare seen
hi furi thu appeasd he put to land
the ghost forsak their seat at hi command
he clear the deck receiv the mighti freight
the leaki vessel groan beneath the weight
slowli she sail and scarc stem the tide
the press water pour within her side
hi passeng at length ar waft oer
exposd in muddi weed upon the miri shore
no sooner land in hi den thei found
the tripl porter of the stygian sound
grim cerberu who soon began to rear

the prudent sibyl had befor prepard
a sop in honei steepd to charm the guard
which mixd with powr drug she cast befor
hi greedi grin jaw just opd to roar
with three enorm mouth he gape and straight

passd on and took th irrem wai
befor the gate the cri of babe new born
whom fate had from their tender mother torn
assault hi ear then those whom form of law

nor want thei lot nor judg to review

absolv the just and doom the guilti soul
the next in place and punish ar thei

fool who repin at their wretch state
and loath anxiou life subornd their fate
with late repent now thei would retriev
the bodi thei forsook and wish to live
their pain and poverti desir to bear
to view the light of heavn and breath the vital air
but fate forbid the stygian flood oppos
and with circl stream the captiv soul inclos
not far from thenc the mourn field appear
so calld from lover that inhabit there
the soul whom that unhappi flame invad
in secret solitud and myrtl shade
make endless moan and pine with desir
lament too late their unextinguishd fire
here procri eriphyl here he found
bare her breast yet bleed with the wound
made by her son he saw pasipha there
with phaedra ghost a foul incestu pair
there laodamia with evadn move
unhappi both but loyal in their love
caeneu a woman onc and onc a man
but end in the sex she first began
not far from these phoenician dido stood
fresh from her wound her bosom bathd in blood
whom when the trojan hero hardli knew
obscur in shade and with a doubt view
doubt as he who see thro duski night
or think he see the moon uncertain light
with tear he first approachd the sullen shade
and as hi love inspird him thu he said
unhappi queen then is the common breath
of rumour true in your report death
and i ala the caus by heavn i vow
and all the powr that rule the realm below
unwil i forsook your friendli state
command by the god and forcd by fate
those god that fate whose unresist might
have sent me to these region void of light
thro the vast empir of etern night
nor dard i to presum that pressd with grief
my flight should urg you to thi dire relief
stai stai your step and listen to my vow
ti the last interview that fate allow
in vain he thu attempt her mind to move
with tear and prayr and laterep love
disdainfulli she lookd then turn round
but fixd her ey unmovd upon the ground
and what he sai and swear regard no more
than the deaf rock when the loud billow roar
but whirld awai to shun hi hate sight
hid in the forest and the shade of night
then sought sichaeu thro the shadi grove
who answerd all her care and equald all her love
some piou tear the piti hero paid
and followd with hi ey the flit shade
then took the forward wai by fate ordaind
and with hi guid the farther field attaind
where severd from the rest the warrior soul remaind
tydeu he met with meleag race
the pride of armi and the soldier grace
and pale adrastu with hi ghastli face
of trojan chief he viewd a numrou train
all much lament all in battl slain

the gladsom ghost in circl troop attend
and with unweari ey behold their friend
delight to hover near and long to know
what bus brought him to the realm below
but argiv chief and agamemnon train
when hi refulg arm flashd thro the shadi plain
fled from hi wellknown face with wont fear
as when hi thundr sword and point spear
drove headlong to their ship and gleand the rout rear
thei raisd a feebl cry with trembl note
but the weak voic deceivd their gasp throat
here priam son deiphobu he found
whose face and limb were on continu wound
dishonest with loppd arm the youth appear
spoild of hi nose and shortend of hi ear
he scarc knew him strive to disown
hi blot form and blush to be known
and therefor first began o teucer race

what heart could wish what hand inflict thi dire disgrac
twa famd that in our last and fatal night

you know in what delud joi we passd
the night that wa by heavn decre our last
for when the fatal hors descend down
pregnant with arm oerwhelmd th unhappi town
she feignd nocturn orgi left my bed
and mixd with trojan dame the danc led
then wave high her torch the signal made
which rousd the grecian from their ambuscad

unhappi i had laid me down to rest
and heavi sleep my weari limb possessd
meantim my worthi wife our arm mislaid
and from beneath my head my sword conveyd

but answer you and in your turn relat

or did you heavn superior doom obei
or tell what other chanc conduct your wai

tumult and torment of th infern seat
while thu in talk the fly hour thei pass

with trebl wall which phlegethon surround
whose fieri flood the burn empir bound
and pressd betwixt the rock the bellow nois resound
wide is the front gate and raisd on high
with adamantin column threat the sky
vain is the forc of man and heavn as vain
to crush the pillar which the pile sustain
sublim on these a towr of steel is reard
and dire tisiphon there keep the ward
girt in her sanguin gown by night and dai
observ of the soul that pass the downward wai
from henc ar heard the groan of ghost the pain

and loud lament that rent the liquid air
she thu repli the chast and holi race

then thei who brother better claim disown
expel their parent and usurp the throne

who dare not give and evn refus to lend

vast is the throng of these nor less the train
of lust youth for foul adultri slain
host of desert who their honour sold

all these within the dungeon depth remain

he said and fall tear hi face bedew
then thrice around hi neck hi arm he threw
and thrice the flit shadow slippd awai
like wind or empti dream that fly the dai
now in a secret vale the trojan see
a seprat grove thro which a gentl breez
plai with a pass breath and whisper thro the tree
and just befor the confin of the wood
the glide leth lead her silent flood
about the bough an airi nation flew
thick as the hum bee that hunt the golden dew
in summer heat on top of lili feed
and creep within their bell to suck the balmi seed
the wing armi roam the field around
the river and the rock remurmur to the sound
aenea wondr stood then askd the caus

henc men and beast the breath of life obtain
and bird of air and monster of the main
th ether vigour is in all the same
and everi soul is filld with equal flame
as much as earthi limb and gross allai
of mortal member subject to decai
blunt not the beam of heavn and edg of dai
from thi coars mixtur of terrestri part
desir and fear by turn possess their heart
and grief and joi nor can the grovel mind
in the dark dungeon of the limb confind
assert the nativ ski or own it heavnli kind
nor death itself can wholli wash their stain
but longcontract filth evn in the soul remain
the relic of inveter vice thei wear
and spot of sin obscen in evri face appear
for thi ar variou penanc enjoind
and some ar hung to bleach upon the wind
some plungd in water other purgd in fire
till all the dreg ar draind and all the rust expir
all have their mane and those mane bear
the few so cleansd to these abod repair
and breath in ampl field the soft elysian air
then ar thei happi when by length of time
the scurf is worn awai of each commit crime
no speck is left of their habitu stain
but the pure ether of the soul remain
but when a thousand roll year ar past
so long their punish and penanc last
whole drove of mind ar by the drive god
compelld to drink the deep lethaean flood
in larg forget draught to steep the care
of their past labour and their irksom year

these purpl vest were weavd by dardan dame

i firmli judg and what i judg desir
he said and then on each bestowd a steed
three hundr hors in high stabl fed
stood readi shine all and smoothli dressd
of these he chose the fairest and the best
to mount the trojan troop at hi command
the steed caparisond with purpl stand
with golden trap gloriou to behold

then to hi absent guest the king decre
a pair of courser born of heavnli breed
who from their nostril breathd ether fire
whom circ stole from her celesti sire
by substitut mare producd on earth
whose womb conceivd a more than mortal birth
these draw the chariot which latinu send
and the rich present to the princ commend
sublim on state steed the trojan born
to their expect lord with peac return
but jealou juno from pachynu height
as she from argo took her airi flight
beheld with enviou ey thi hate sight
she saw the trojan and hi joy train
descend upon the shore desert the main
design a town and with unhopd success

then piercd with pain she shook her haughti head
sighd from her inward soul and thu she said
o hate offspr of my phrygian foe
o fate of troi which juno fate oppos
could thei not fall unpiti on the plain
but slain reviv and taken scape again
when execr troi in ash lai
thro fire and sword and sea thei forcd their wai
then vanquishd juno must in vain contend
her rage disarmd her empir at an end
breathless and tird is all my furi spent
or doe my glut spleen at length relent
as if twere littl from their town to chase
i thro the sea pursu their exild race
ingagd the heavn opposd the stormi main
but billow roard and tempest ragd in vain
what have my scylla and my syrt done
when these thei overpass and those thei shun
on tiber shore thei land secur of fate
triumphant oer the storm and juno hate
mar could in mutual blood the centaur bath
and jove himself gave wai to cynthia wrath
who sent the tuski boar to calydon
what great offenc had either peopl done
but i the consort of the thunder
have wagd a long and unsuccess war
with variou art and arm in vain have toild
and by a mortal man at length am foild
if nativ powr prevail not shall i doubt
to seek for need succour from without
if jove and heavn my just desir deni
hell shall the powr of heavn and jove suppli
grant that the fate have firmd by their decre
the trojan race to reign in itali
at least i can defer the nuptial dai
and with protract war the peac delai
with blood the dear allianc shall be bought
and both the peopl near destruct brought
so shall the soninlaw and father join
with ruin war and wast of either line
o fatal maid thy marriag is endowd
with phrygian latian and rutulian blood
bellona lead thee to thy lover hand
anoth queen bring forth anoth brand
to burn with foreign fire anoth land
a second pari diffr but in name

thu have said she sink beneath the ground
with furiou hast and shoot the stygian sound

so fright ar the form the monster take
so fierc the hiss of her speckl snake

o virgin daughter of etern night
give me thi onc thy labour to sustain

let not the trojan with a feignd pretenc
of profferd peac delud the latian princ
expel from itali that odiou name
and let not juno suffer in her fame
ti thine to ruin realm oerturn a state
betwixt the dearest friend to rais debat
and kindl kindr blood to mutual hate
thy hand oer town the funral torch displai
and form a thousand ill ten thousand wai
now shake out thy fruit breast the seed

confound the peac establishd and prepar
their soul to hatr and their hand to war
smeard as she wa with black gorgonian blood
the furi sprang abov the stygian flood
and on her wicker wing sublim thro night

there sought the queen apart stood befor

and the new nuptial of the trojan guest

with her full forc she threw the poison dart
and fixd it deep within amata heart
that thu envenomd she might kindl rage

and with hi circl volum fold her hair
at first the silent venom slid with eas
and seizd her cooler sens by degre
then er th infect mass wa fird too far
in plaintiv accent she began the war
and thu bespok her husband shall she said
a wandr princ enjoi lavinia bed
if natur plead not in a parent heart
piti my tear and piti her desert
i know my dearest lord the time will come
youd in vain revers your cruel doom
the faithless pirat soon will set to sea
and bear the royal virgin far awai
a guest like him a trojan guest befor
in shew of friendship sought the spartan shore
and ravishd helen from her husband bore
think on a king inviol word
and think on turnu her onc plight lord
to thi fals foreign you give your throne
and wrong a friend a kinsman and a son
resum your ancient care and if the god

then if the line of turnu you retrac

but when she saw her reason idli spent
and could not move him from hi fixd intent
she flew to rage for now the snake possessd

and fill with horrid howl the public place
and as young stripl whip the top for sport

like furi seizd the rest the progress known

all clad in skin of beast the javlin bear
give to the wanton wind their flow hair
and shriek and shout rend the suffr air
the queen herself inspird with rage divin
shook high abov her head a flame pine
then rolld her haggard ey around the throng
and sung in turnu name the nuptial song

white foam at first on the curld ocean fri
then roar the main the billow mount the ski
till by the furi of the storm full blown
the muddi bottom oer the cloud is thrown
first almon fall old tyrrheu eldest care
piercd with an arrow from the distant war
fixd in hi throat the fly weapon stood
and stoppd hi breath and drank hi vital blood
huge heap of slain around the bodi rise

amidst the mad of th unruli train

the discord is complet nor can thei ceas

a bloodi hymen shall th allianc join

but thou with speed to night and hell repair
for not the god nor angri jove will bear
thy lawless wandr walk in upper air
leav what remain to me saturnia said
the sullen fiend her sound wing displayd
unwil left the light and sought the nether shade
in midst of itali well known to fame
there li a lake amsanctu is the name
below the lofti mount on either side
thick forest the forbidden entranc hide
full in the centr of the sacr wood

which break from beneath with bellow sound
whirl the black wave and rattl stone around

saturnian juno now with doubl care

implor the god and to their king complain
the corp of almon and the rest ar shown
shriek clamour murmur fill the fright town
ambiti turnu in the press appear
and aggrav crime augment their fear
proclaim hi privat injuri aloud
a solemn promis made and disavowd
a foreign son is sought and a mixd mungril brood
then thei whose mother frantic with their fear
in wood and wild the flag of bacchu bear
and lead hi danc with disheveld hair
increas the clamour and the war demand
such wa amata intrest in the land
against the public sanction of the peac
against all omen of their ill success
with fate avers the rout in arm resort
to forc their monarch and insult the court
but like a rock unmovd a rock that brave
the rage tempest and the rise wave
proppd on himself he stand hi solid side
wash off the seawe and the sound tide
so stood the piou princ unmovd and long

but when he found that juno powr prevaild

he call the god to wit their offenc
disclaim the war assert hi innoc

and prai to heavn for peac but prai too late

the funral pomp which to your king you pai

he said no more but in hi wall confind
shut out the woe which he too well divind
nor with the rise storm would vainli strive
but left the helm and let the vessel drive
a solemn custom wa observd of old
which latium held and now the roman hold
their standard when in fight field thei rear
against the fierc hyrcanian or declar
the scythian indian or arabian war
or from the boast parthian would regain
their eagl lost in carrha bloodi plain
two gate of steel the name of mar thei bear
and still ar worshipd with religi fear
befor hi templ stand the dire abod
and the feard issu of the furiou god

the wari guardian janu doubli wait
then when the sacr senat vote the war

these rite of old by sovreign princ usd
were the king offic but the king refusd
deaf to their cri nor would the gate unbar
of sacr peac or loos th imprisond war

abhorrd the wick ministri of arm
then heavn imperi queen shot down from high

ye muse open all your helicon
sing you the chief that swayd th ausonian land
their arm and armi under their command
what warrior in our ancient clime were bred
what soldier followd and what hero led
for well you know and can record alon
what fame to futur time convei but darkli down
mezentiu first appeard upon the plain

the charm lausu full of youth fire
rode in the rank and next hi sullen sire
to turnu onli second in the grace
of manli mien and featur of the face
a skil horseman and a huntsman bred
with fate avers a thousand men he led
hi sire unworthi of so brave a son
himself well worthi of a happier throne
next aventinu drive hi chariot round
the latian plain with palm and laurel crownd
proud of hi steed he smoke along the field
hi father hydra fill hi ampl shield
a hundr serpent hiss about the brim
the son of hercul he justli seem
by hi broad shoulder and gigant limb
of heavnli part and part of earthli blood
a mortal woman mix with a god
for strong alcid after he had slain
the tripl geryon drove from conquerd spain
hi captiv herd and thenc in triumph led
on tuscan tiber flowri bank thei fed
then on mount aventin the son of jove
the priestess rhea found and forcd to love
for arm hi men long pile and javlin bore
and pole with point steel their foe in battl gore
like hercul himself hi son appear
in salvag pomp a lion hide he wear
about hi shoulder hang the shaggi skin
the teeth and gape jaw sever grin
thu like the god hi father home dressd
he stride into the hall a horrid guest
then two twin brother from fair tibur came
which from their brother tibur took the name
fierc cora and catillu void of fear
armd argiv hors thei led and in the front appear
like cloudborn centaur from the mountain height
with rapid cours descend to the fight
thei rush along the rattl wood give wai

nor arm thei wear nor sword and buckler wield
nor drive the chariot thro the dusti field
but whirl from leathern sling huge ball of lead

but in a bull raw hide thei sheath the right
messapu next great neptun wa hi sire
secur of steel and fate from the fire

a heartless train unexercisd in arm
the just faliscan he to battl bring
and those who live where lake ciminiu spring
and where feronia grove and templ stand
who till fescennian or flavinian land
all these in order march and march sing
the warlik action of their seaborn king
like a long team of snowi swan on high
which clap their wing and cleav the liquid sky
when homeward from their watri pastur born
thei sing and asia lake their note return
not on who heard their music from afar
would think these troop an armi traind to war
but flock of fowl that when the tempest roar
with their hoars gabbl seek the silent shore
then clausu came who led a numrou band
of troop embodi from the sabin land
and in himself alon an armi brought
twa he the nobl claudian race begot
the claudian race ordaind in time to come
to share the great of imperi rome
he led the cure forth of old renown
mutuscan from their olivebear town
and all th eretian powr besid a band
that followd from velinum dewi land
and amiternian troop of mighti fame
and mountain that from severu came
and from the craggi cliff of tetrica
and those where yellow tiber take hi wai
and where himella wanton water plai
casperia send her arm with those that lie
by fabari and fruit foruli
the warlik aid of horta next appear
and the cold nursian come to close the rear
mixd with the nativ born of latin blood
whom allia wash with her fatal flood
not thicker billow beat the libyan main
when pale orion set in wintri rain
nor thicker harvest on rich hermu rise
or lycian field when phoebu burn the ski
than stand these troop their buckler ring around
their trampl turn the turf and shake the solid ground
high in hi chariot then halesu came
a foe by birth to troi unhappi name
from agamemnon bornto turnu aid
a thousand men the youth hero led
who till the massic soil for wine renownd
and fierc auruncan from their hilli ground
and those who live by sidicinian shore
and where with shoali ford vulturnu roar
cale and osca old inhabit
and rough saticulan inurd to want
light demil from afar thei throw
fastend with leathern thong to gall the foe
short crook sword in closer fight thei wear
and on their ward arm light buckler bear
nor oebalu shalt thou be left unsung
from nymph semethi and old telon sprung
who then in teleboan capri reignd
but that short isl th ambiti youth disdaind
and oer campania stretchd hi ampl swai
where swell sarnu seek the tyrrhen sea

and these as wa the teuton us of old

their casqu ar cork a cover thick and light
next these in rank the warlik ufen went
and led the mountain troop that nursia sent
the rude equicola hi rule obeyd

in arm thei plowd to battl still prepard
their soil wa barren and their heart were hard
umbro the priest the proud marrubian led
by king archippu sent to turnu aid
and peac oliv crownd hi hoari head
hi wand and holi word the viper rage
and venomd wound of serpent could assuag
he when he pleasd with power juic to steep
their templ shut their ey in pleas sleep
but vain were marsian herb and magic art
to cure the wound givn by the dardan dart
yet hi untim fate th angitian wood
in sigh remurmurd to the fucin flood
the son of famd hippolytu wa there

where great diana peac altar flame

with sword and point spear and clattr shield
of argiv and of old sicanian band
and those who plow the rich rutulian land

and the proud labican with paint shield
and those who near numician stream resid
and those whom tiber holi forest hide
or circ hill from the main land divid
where ufen glide along the lowli land
or the black water of pomptina stand
last from the volscian fair camilla came
and led her warlik troop a warrior dame
unbr to spin in the loom unskilld
she chose the nobler palla of the field
mixd with the first the fierc virago fought
sustaind the toil of arm the danger sought
outstrippd the wind in speed upon the plain
flew oer the field nor hurt the beard grain
she swept the sea and as she skimmd along

men boi and women stupid with surpris
whereer she pass fix their wondr ey
long thei look and gape at the sight
devour her oer and oer with vast delight
her purpl habit sit with such a grace
on her smooth shoulder and so suit her face
her head with ringlet of her hair is crownd
and in a golden caul the curl ar bound
she shake her myrtl javlin and behind
her lycian quiver danc in the wind

thu spoke evand to hi royal guest
these rite these altar and thi feast o king
from no vain fear or superstit spring
or blind devot or from blinder chanc
or headi zeal or brutal ignor
but savd from danger with a grate sens
the labour of a god we recompens
see from afar yon rock that mate the sky
about whose feet such heap of rubbish lie
such indigest ruin bleak and bare
how desert now it stand exposd in air
twa onc a robber den inclosd around
with live stone and deep beneath the ground
the monster cacu more than half a beast
thi hold impervi to the sun possessd
the pavement ever foul with human gore
head and their mangl member hung the door
vulcan thi plagu begot and like hi sire
black cloud he belchd and flake of livid fire
time long expect easd us of our load
and brought the need presenc of a god
th aveng forc of hercul from spain
arrivd in triumph from geryon slain
thrice livd the giant and thrice livd in vain
hi prize the low herd alcid drove
near tiber bank to graze the shadi grove
allurd with hope of plunder and intent
by forc to rob by fraud to circumv
the brutal cacu as by chanc thei strayd
four oxen thenc and four fair kine conveyd
and lest the print footstep might be seen
he draggd em backward to hi rocki den
the track avers a ly notic gave
and led the searcher backward from the cave
meantim the herdsman hero shift hi place
to find fresh pastur and untrodden grass
the beast who missd their mate filld all around
with bellow and the rock restord the sound
on heifer who had heard her love complain
roard from the cave and made the project vain
alcid found the fraud with rage he shook
and tossd about hi head hi knot oak
swift as the wind or scythian arrow flight
he clomb with eager hast th aerial height
then first we saw the monster mend hi pace
fear in hi ey and pale in hi face
confessd the god approach trembl he spring
as terror had increasd hi feet with wing
nor stayd for stair but down the depth he threw
hi bodi on hi back the door he drew
the door a rib of live rock with pain
hi father hewd it out and bound with iron chain
he broke the heavi link the mountain closd
and bar and lever to hi foe opposd
the wretch had hardli made hi dungeon fast
the fierc aveng came with bound hast
surveyd the mouth of the forbidden hold
and here and there hi rage ey he rolld
he gnashd hi teeth and thrice he compassd round
with wing speed the circuit of the ground
thrice at the cavern mouth he pulld in vain
and pant thrice desist from hi pain
a point flinti rock all bare and black
grew gibbou from behind the mountain back
owl raven all ill omen of the night
here built their nest and hither wingd their flight
the lean head hung threatn oer the flood
and nod to the left the hero stood
advers with plant feet and from the right
tuggd at the solid stone with all hi might
thu heavd the fixd foundat of the rock
gave wai heavn echod at the rattl shock
tumbl it chokd the flood on either side
the bank leap backward and the stream divid
the sky shrunk upward with unusu dread
and trembl tiber divd beneath hi bed
the court of cacu stand reveald to sight
the cavern glare with newadmit light
so the pent vapour with a rumbl sound
heav from below and rend the hollow ground
a sound flaw succe and from on high
the god with hate beheld the nether sky
the ghost repin at violat night
and curs th invad sun and sicken at the sight

he take the wishd occas fill hi hand
with readi fire and shake a flame brand
urgd by hi presenc evri soul is warmd
and evri hand with kindl fire is armd
from the fird pine the scattr sparkl fly
fat vapour mixd with flame involv the sky
what powr o muse could avert the flame
which threatend in the fleet the trojan name
tell for the fact thro length of time obscur
is hard to faith yet shall the fame endur
ti said that when the chief prepard hi flight
and felld hi timber from mount ida height
the grandam goddess then approachd her son
and with a mother majesti begun
grant me she said the sole request i bring
sinc conquerd heavn ha ownd you for it king
on ida brow for ag past there stood
with fir and mapl filld a shadi wood
and on the summit rose a sacr grove
where i wa worshipd with religi love
those wood that holi grove my long delight
i gave the trojan princ to speed hi flight
now filld with fear on their behalf i come
let neither wind oerset nor wave intomb
the float forest of the sacr pine
but let it be their safeti to be mine
then thu repli her aw son who roll
the radiant star and heavn and earth control
how dare you mother endless date demand
for vessel mould by a mortal hand
what then is fate shall bold aenea ride
of safeti certain on th uncertain tide
yet what i can i grant when waft oer
the chief is land on the latian shore
whatev ship escap the rage storm
at my command shall chang their fade form
to nymph divin and plow the watri wai
like doti and the daughter of the sea
to seal hi sacr vow by styx he swore
the lake of liquid pitch the dreari shore
and phlegethon innavig flood
and the black region of hi brother god
he said and shook the ski with hi imperi nod
and now at length the numberd hour were come
prefixd by fate irrevoc doom
when the great mother of the god wa free
to save her ship and finish jove decre
first from the quarter of the morn there sprung
a light that signd the heavn and shot along
then from a cloud fringd round with golden fire
were timbrel heard and berecynthian choir
and last a voic with more than mortal sound
both host in arm opposd with equal horror wound
o trojan race your needless aid forbear
and know my ship ar my peculiar care
with greater eas the bold rutulian mai
with hiss brand attempt to burn the sea
than sing my sacr pine but you my charg
loosd from your crook anchor launch at larg
exalt each a nymph forsak the sand
and swim the sea at cybel command
no sooner had the goddess ceasd to speak
when lo th obedi ship their haulser break
and strang to tell like dolphin in the main
thei plung their prow and dive and spring again
as mani beauteou maid the billow sweep
as rode befor tall vessel on the deep
the foe surprisd with wonder stood aghast
messapu curbd hi fieri courser hast
old tiber roard and rais up hi head
calld back hi water to their oozi bed
turnu alon undaunt bore the shock
and with these word hi trembl troop bespok
these monster for the trojan fate ar meant
and ar by jove for black presag sent
he take the coward last relief awai
for fly thei cannot and constraind to stai
must yield unfought a base inglori prei
the liquid half of all the globe is lost
heavn shut the sea and we secur the coast
their is no more than that small spot of ground
which myriad of our martial men surround
their fate i fear not or vain oracl
twa givn to venu thei should cross the sea
and land secur upon the latian plain
their promisd hour is passd and mine remain
ti in the fate of turnu to destroi
with sword and fire the faithless race of troi
shall such affront as these alon inflam
the grecian brother and the grecian name
my caus and their is on a fatal strife
and final ruin for a ravishd wife
wa t not enough that punishd for the crime
thei fell but will thei fall a second time
on would have thought thei paid enough befor
to curs the costli sex and durst offend no more
can thei secur trust their feebl wall
a slight partit a thin interv
betwixt their fate and them when troi tho built
by hand divin yet perishd by their guilt
lend me for onc my friend your valiant hand
to forc from out their line these dastard band
less than a thousand ship will end thi war
nor vulcan need hi fate arm prepar
let all the tuscan all th arcadian join
nor these nor those shall frustrat my design
let them not fear the treason of the night
the robbd palladium the pretend flight
our onset shall be made in open light
no wooden engin shall their town betrai

no grecian babe befor their camp appear

hardli thei work with frugal diet fed
from plow and harrow sent to seek renown
thei fight in field and storm the shaken town
no part of life from toil of war is free
no chang in ag or diffrenc in degre
we plow and till in arm our oxen feel
instead of goad the spur and point steel
th invert lanc make furrow in the plain

thi foul reproach ascaniu could not hear

at the full stretch of both hi hand he drew

but first befor the throne of jove he stood
and thu with lift hand invokd the god

now tempt the war no more he said and flew
obscur in air and vanishd from their view

then duteou forc thei us and phoebu name

undaunt thei themselv no danger shun
from wall to wall the shout and clamour run

heap of spent arrow fall and strew the ground
and helm and shield and rattl arm resound
the combat thicken like the storm that fli

the foe had left the fast of their place
prevaild in fight and had hi men in chase

a dart were lost within that roomi breast
but from a knot lanc larg heavi strong
which roard like thunder as it whirld along
not two bull hide th impetu forc withhold

down sunk the monster bulk and pressd the ground

not with less ruin than the bajan mole

then black despair precipit their flight
when pandaru beheld hi brother killd

some happier friend within the wall inclosd

my messag to the ghost of priam bear

a lanc of tough ground ash the trojan threw

imperi juno turnd the cours befor

in pride of youth the sabin clausu came

the spear flew hiss thro the middl space
and piercd hi throat direct at hi face
it stoppd at onc the passag of hi wind
and the free soul to flit air resignd
hi forehead wa the first that struck the ground
lifeblood and life rushd mingl thro the wound
he slew three brother of the borean race

thi said he strode with eager hast along
and bore amidst the thickest of the throng
lagu the first he met with fate to foe
had heavd a stone of mighti weight to throw
stoop the spear descend on hi chine
just where the bone distinguish either loin
it stuck so fast so deepli buri lai
that scarc the victor forcd the steel awai
hisbon came on but while he movd too slow
to wishd reveng the princ prevent hi blow
for ward hi at onc at onc he pressd
and plungd the fatal weapon in hi breast
then lewd anchemolu he laid in dust
who staind hi stepdam bed with impiou lust
and after him the daucian twin were slain

so wondrou like in featur shape and size
as causd an error in their parent ey

the nice distinct and their fate divid
for thymbru head wa loppd and lari hand
dismemberd sought it owner on the strand
the trembl finger yet the falchion strain
and threaten still th intend stroke in vain
now to renew the charg th arcadian came
sight of such act and sens of honest shame
and grief with anger mixd their mind inflam
then with a casual blow wa rhoeteu slain
who chancd as palla threw to cross the plain
the fly spear wa after ilu sent
but rhoeteu happend on a death unmeant
from teuthra and from tyre while he fled
the lanc athwart hi bodi laid him dead
rolld from hi chariot with a mortal wound
and intercept fate he spurnd the ground
as when in summer welcom wind aris
the watch shepherd to the forest fli

and catch flame infect the neighbr head
around the forest fli the furiou blast
and all the leafi nation sink at last
and vulcan ride in triumph oer the wast
the pastor pleasd with hi dire victori
behold the satiat flame in sheet ascend the sky
so palla troop their scatterd strength unit
and pour on their foe their princ delight
halesu came fierc with desir of blood
but first collect in hi arm he stood

ladon demodocu and phere fell
around hi head he tossd hi glittr brand
and from strymoniu hewd hi better hand

at thoa ampl front and piercd the bone
it struck beneath the space of either ey
and blood and mingl brain togeth fly
deep skilld in futur fate halesu sire
did with the youth to lone grove retir
but when the father mortal race wa run
dire destini laid hold upon the son
and hauld him to the war to find beneath

the dart came drive on and piercd hi breast
but lausu no small portion of the war
permit not panic fear to reign too far
causd by the death of so renownd a knight
but by hi own exampl cheer the fight
fierc aba first he slew aba the stai
of trojan hope and hindranc of the dai
the phrygian troop escapd the greek in vain
thei and their mixd alli now load the plain
to the rude shock of war both armi came
their leader equal and their strength the same
the rear so pressd the front thei could not wield
their angri weapon to disput the field
here palla urg on and lausu there
of equal youth and beauti both appear
but both by fate forbid to breath their nativ air
their congress in the field great jove withstand
both doomd to fall but fall by greater hand
meantim juturna warn the daunian chief

with hi drivn chariot he divid the crowd

he said and to the void advancd hi pace
pale horror sate on each arcadian face
then turnu from hi chariot leap light
addressd himself on foot to singl fight
and as a lionwhen he spi from far
a bull that seem to medit the war
bend hi neck and spurn back the sand
run roar downward from hi hilli stand
imagin eager turnu not more slow

then jove to sooth hi sorrow thu began
short bound of life ar set to mortal man
ti virtu work alon to stretch the narrow span
so mani son of god in bloodi fight
around the wall of troi have lost the light
my own sarpedon fell beneath hi foe
nor i hi mighti sire could ward the blow
evn turnu shortli shall resign hi breath
and stand alreadi on the verg of death
thi said the god permit the fatal fight
but from the latian field avert hi sight
now with full forc hi spear young palla threw
and have thrown hi shine falchion drew
the steel just grazd along the shoulder joint
and markd it slightli with the glanc point
fierc turnu first to nearer distanc drew
and poisd hi point spear befor he threw
then as the wing weapon whizzd along
see now said he whose arm is better strung
the spear kept on the fatal cours unstayd
by plate of irn which oer the shield were laid
thro fold brass and tough bull hide it passd
hi corslet piercd and reachd hi heart at last
in vain the youth tug at the broken wood
the soul come issu with the vital blood
he fall hi arm upon hi bodi sound
and with hi bloodi teeth he bite the ground
turnu bestrod the corps arcadian hear
said he my messag to your master bear
such as the sire deservd the son i send
it cost him dear to be the phrygian friend
the lifeless bodi tell him i bestow
unaskd to rest hi wandr ghost below
he said and trampl down with all the forc
of hi left foot and spurnd the wretch cors
then snatchd the shine belt with gold inlaid
the belt euryt art hand had made
where fifti fatal bride expressd to sight
all in the compass of on mourn night
deprivd their bridegroom of return light
in an ill hour insult turnu tore
those golden spoil and in a wors he wore
o mortal blind in fate who never know
to bear high fortun or endur the low
the time shall come when turnu but in vain
shall wish untouchd the trophi of the slain

and curs the dire remembr of the dai

o grace and grief of war at onc restord
with prais to thy sire at onc deplord
on dai first sent thee to the fight field
beheld whole heap of foe in battl killd

then creep claspd the hero knee and prayd

he said the hero sternli thu repli

when palla fell so deem nor deem alon

and seek reveng himself on other foe
at anxur shield he drove and at the blow
both shield and arm to ground togeth go
anxur had boast much of magic charm
and thought he wore impenetr arm
so made by mutterd spell and from the sphere
had life securd in vain for length of year
then tarquitu the field in triumph trod

with strength like hi the trojan hero stood
and soon the field with fall corp were strowd
when onc hi falchion found the tast of blood
with furi scarc to be conceivd he flew

thei when thei see the fieri chief advanc
and push at their chest hi point lanc
wheeld with so swift a motion mad with fear
thei threw their master headlong from the chair

now lucagu and liger scour the plain

whom thu the chief upbraid with scorn spite
blame not the slow of your steed in flight
vain shadow did not forc their swift retreat

he said and seizd at onc the loosend rein

now take your turn and as a brother should

then thro hi breast hi fatal sword he sent
and the soul issu at the gape vent

to whom the goddess thu with weep ey

he said and brandish at onc hi blade
with eager pace pursu the fly shade

with wind in poop the vessel plow the sea
and measur back with speed her former wai
meantim aenea seek hi absent foe
and send hi slaughterd troop to shade below
the guil phantom now forsook the shroud
and flew sublim and vanishd in a cloud
too late young turnu the delus found

whose holi soul the stroke of fortun fled
presciou of ill and leav me behind
to drink the dreg of life by fate assignd
beyond the goal of natur i have gone
my palla late set out but reachd too soon
if for my leagu against th ausonian state
amidst their weapon i had found my fate
deservd from them then i had been returnd
a breathless victor and my son had mournd
yet will i not my trojan friend upbraid
nor grudg th allianc i so gladli made
twa not hi fault my palla fell so young
but my own crime for have livd too long
yet sinc the god had destind him to die
at least he led the wai to victori
first for hi friend he won the fatal shore
and sent whole herd of slaughterd foe befor
a death too great too gloriou to deplor
nor will i add new honour to thy grave
content with those the trojan hero gave
that funer pomp thy phrygian friend designd
in which the tuscan chief and armi joind
great spoil and trophi gaind by thee thei bear
then let thy own achiev be thy share
even thou o turnu hadst a trophi stood
whose mighti trunk had better gracd the wood
if palla had arrivd with equal length
of year to match thy bulk with equal strength
but why unhappi man dost thou detain
these troop to view the tear thou sheddst in vain
go friend thi messag to your lord relat
tell him that if i bear my bitter fate

joi is no more but i would gladli go
to greet my palla with such new below
the morn had now dispelld the shade of night
restor toil when she restord the light
the trojan king and tuscan chief command
to rais the pile along the wind strand
their friend convei the dead funral fire
black smouldr smoke from the green wood expir
the light of heavn is chokd and the new dai retir
then thrice around the kindl pile thei go
for ancient custom had ordaind it so
thrice hors and foot about the fire ar led
and thrice with loud lament thei hail the dead
tear trickl down their breast bedew the ground
and drum and trumpet mix their mourn sound
amid the blaze their piou brethren throw
the spoil in battl taken from the foe
helm bit embossd and sword of shine steel
on cast a target on a chariot wheel
some to their fellow their own arm restor
the falchion which in luckless fight thei bore
their buckler piercd their dart bestowd in vain
and shiverd lanc gatherd from the plain
whole herd of offerd bull about the fire
and bristl boar and woolli sheep expir
around the pile a care troop attend
to watch the wast flame and weep their burn friend

and part ar to the neighbr field conveyd

born off in state ar buri in the town
the rest unhonourd and without a name
ar cast a common heap to feed the flame
trojan and latian vie with like desir
to make the field of battl shine with fire
and the promiscu blaze to heavn aspir
now had the morn thrice renewd the light
and thrice dispelld the shadow of the night
when those who round the wast fire remain
perform the last sad offic to the slain
thei rake the yet warm ash from below
these and the bone unburnd in earth bestow
these relic with their countri rite thei grace
and rais a mount of turf to mark the place
but in the palac of the king appear
a scene more solemn and a pomp of tear
maid matron widow mix their common moan
orphan their sire and sire lament their son
all in that univers sorrow share
and curs the caus of thi unhappi war
a broken leagu a bride unjustli sought
a crown usurpd which with their blood is bought
these ar the crime with which thei load the name
of turnu and on him alon exclaim
let him who lord it oer th ausonian land
engag the trojan hero hand to hand
hi is the gain our lot is but to serv
ti just the swai he seek he should deserv
thi dranc aggrav and add with spite
hi foe expect and dare him to the fight

a needless ill your ancestor abhorrd

i might have promisd to myself those harm

how high he held hi shield and rose at evri blow
had troi producd two more hi match in might
thei would have changd the fortun of the fight
th invas of the greek had been returnd
our empir wast and our citi burnd
the long defenc the trojan peopl made

aenea not inferior in the field

he said no more but with thi cold excus

i wish ye latin what we now debat

much better had it been for you and me
unforcd by thi our last necess

o citizen we wage unequ war
with men not onli heavn peculiar care
but heavn own race unconquerd in the field
or conquerd yet unknow how to yield
what hope you had in diomed lai down
our hope must centr on ourselv alon
yet those how feebl and inde how vain
you see too well nor need my word explain
vanquishd without resourc laid flat by fate
faction within a foe without the gate
not but i grant that all performd their part
with manli forc and with undaunt heart
with our unit strength the war we wagd
with equal number equal arm engagd
you see th eventnow hear what i propos

a tract of land the latin have possessd

if you consent the trojan shall command

then dranc took the word who grudgd long sinc

such truth o king said he your word contain

if still we fear hi forc he must be wood
hi haughti godhead we with prayr implor
your scepter to releas and our just right restor
o curs caus of all our ill must we
wage war unjust and fall in fight for thee
what right hast thou to rule the latian state
and send us out to meet our certain fate
ti a destruct war from turnu hand
our peac and public safeti we demand
let the fair bride to the brave chief remain
if not the peac without the pledg is vain
turnu i know you think me not your friend
nor will i much with your belief contend
i beg your great not to give the law
in other realm but beaten to withdraw
piti your own or piti our estat
nor twist our fortun with your sink fate
your interest is the war should never ceas
but we have felt enough to wish the peac
a land exhaust to the last remain
depopul town and driven plain
yet if desir of fame and thirst of powr
a beauteou princess with a crown in dowr
so fire your mind in arm assert your right
and meet your foe who dare you to the fight
mankind it seem is made for you alon
we but the slave who mount you to the throne
a base ignobl crowd without a name
unwept unworthi of the funral flame
by duti bound to forfeit each hi life
that turnu mai possess a royal wife
permit not mighti man so mean a crew
should share such triumph and detain from you
the post of honour your undoubt due
rather alon your matchless forc emploi
to merit what alon you must enjoi
these word so full of malic mixd with art
inflamd with rage the youth hero heart
then groan from the bottom of hi breast
he heavd for wind and thu hi wrath expressd
you dranc never want a stream of word
then when the public need requir our sword
first in the council hall to steer the state
and ever foremost in a tonguedeb
while our strong wall secur us from the foe
er yet with blood our ditch overflow
but let the potent orat declaim
and with the brand of coward blot my name
free leav is givn him when hi fatal hand
ha coverd with more corp the sanguin strand
and high as mine hi towr trophi stand
if ani doubt remain who dare the most
let us decid it at the trojan cost
and issu both abreast where honour call
foe ar not far to seek without the wall
unless hi noisi tongu can onli fight
and feet were givn him but to speed hi flight
i beaten from the field i forcd awai
who but so known a dastard dare to sai
had he but evn beheld the fight hi ey
had witnessd for me what hi tongu deni
what heap of trojan by thi hand were slain
and how the bloodi tiber swelld the main
all saw but he th arcadian troop retir
in scatterd squadron and their princ expir
the giant brother in their camp have found
i wa not forcd with eas to quit my ground
not such the trojan tri me when inclosd
i singli their unit arm opposd
first forcd an entranc thro their thick arrai
then glut with their slaughter freed my wai
ti a destruct war so let it be
but to the phrygian pirat and to thee
meantim proce to fill the peopl ear
with fals report their mind with panic fear
extol the strength of a twiceconquerd race
our foe encourag and our friend debas
believ thy fabl and the trojan town
triumphant stand the grecian ar oerthrown
suppliant at hector feet achil li
and diomed from fierc aenea fli
sai rapid aufidu with aw dread
run backward from the sea and hide hi head
when the great trojan on hi bank appear
for that as true as thy dissembl fear
of my reveng dismiss that vaniti
thou dranc art below a death from me
let that vile soul in that vile bodi rest
the lodg is well worthi of the guest
now royal father to the present state
of our affair and of thi high debat
if in your arm thu earli you diffid
and think your fortun is alreadi tri
if on defeat ha brought us down so low
as never more in field to meet the foe
then i conclud for peac ti time to treat
and lie like vassal at the victor feet
but o if ani ancient blood remain
on drop of all our father in our vein
that man would i prefer befor the rest
who dard hi death with an undaunt breast
who come fell by no dishonest wound
to shun that sight and dy gnawd the ground
but if we still have fresh recruit in store
if our confeder can afford us more
if the contend field we brave fought
and not a bloodless victori wa bought
their loss equald our and for their slain
with equal fire thei filld the shine plain
why thu unforcd should we so tame yield
and er the trumpet sound resign the field
good unexpect evil unforeseen
appear by turn as fortun shift the scene
some raisd aloft come tumbl down amain
then fall so hard thei bound and rise again
if diomed refus hi aid to lend
the great messapu yet remain our friend
tolumniu who foretel event is our
th italian chief and princ join their powr
nor least in number nor in name the last
your own brave subject have your caus embracd
abov the rest the volscian amazon
contain an armi in herself alon
and head a squadron terribl to sight
with glittr shield in brazen armour bright
yet if the foe a singl fight demand
and i alon the public peac withstand
if you consent he shall not be refusd
nor find a hand to victori unusd
thi new achil let him take the field
with fate armour and vulcanian shield
for you my royal father and my fame

the top is level an offens seat
of war and from the war a safe retreat
for on the right and left is room to press
the foe at hand or from afar distress
to drive em headlong downward and to pour

thither young turnu took the wellknown wai
possessd the pass and in blind ambush lai
meantim latonian phoeb from the ski
beheld th approach war with hate ey
and calld the lightfoot opi to her aid
her most belovd and evertrusti maid
then with a sigh began camilla goe
to meet her death amidst her fatal foe
the nymph i lovd of all my mortal train
invest with diana arm in vain
nor is my kind for the virgin new
twa born with her and with her year it grew
her father metabu when forcd awai

raisd oer the border with unusu rain
prepard to plung into the stream he fear
not for himself but for the charg he bear
anxiou he stop a while and think in hast
then desprat in distress resolv at last
a knotti lanc of wellboild oak he bore

he closd the child within the hollow space
with twig of bend osier bound the case
then poisd the spear heavi with human weight
and thu invokd my favour for the freight
accept great goddess of the wood he said
sent by her sire thi dedic maid
thro air she fli a suppliant to thy shrine
and the first weapon that she know ar thine
he said and with full forc the spear he threw
abov the sound wave camilla flew
then pressd by foe he stemmd the stormi tide
and gaind by stress of arm the farther side
hi fastend spear he pulld from out the ground
and victor of hi vow hi infant nymph unbound
nor after that in town which wall inclos
would trust hi hunt life amidst hi foe
but rough in open air he chose to lie

on hill unshorn or in a desert den
he shunnd the dire societi of men
a shepherd solitari life he led
hi daughter with the milk of mare he fed
the dug of bear and evri salvag beast
he drew and thro her lip the liquor pressd
the littl amazon could scarc go
he load her with a quiver and a bow
and that she might her staggr step command
he with a slender javlin fill her hand
her flow hair no golden fillet bound
nor swept her trail robe the dusti ground
instead of these a tiger hide oerspread
her back and shoulder fastend to her head
the fly dart she first attempt to fling
and round her tender templ tossd the sling
then as her strength with year increasd began
to pierc aloft in air the soar swan
and from the cloud to fetch the heron and the crane
the tuscan matron with each other vi
to bless their rival son with such a bride
but she disdain their love to share with me
the sylvan shade and vowd virgin
and o i wish content with my care
of salvag spoil she had not sought the war
then had she been of my celesti train
and shunnd the fate that doom her to be slain
but sinc oppos heavn decre she goe
to find her death among forbidden foe

where with the god avers the latin fight
thi bow to thee thi quiver i bequeath
thi chosen arrow to reveng her death
by whateer hand camilla shall be slain
or of the trojan or italian train
let him not pass unpunishd from the plain
then in a hollow cloud myself will aid
to bear the breathless bodi of my maid
unspoild shall be her arm and unprofand
her holi limb with ani human hand
and in a marbl tomb laid in her nativ land
she said the faith nymph descend from high
with rapid flight and cut the sound sky
black cloud and stormi wind around her bodi fly
by thi the trojan and the tuscan hors
drawn up in squadron with unit forc
approach the wall the sprightli courser bound
press forward on their bit and shift their ground
shield arm and spear flash horribl from far
and the field glitter with a wave war
opposd to these come on with furiou forc
messapu cora and the latian hors

and sling their shield behind to save their back in flight
spur at speed to their own wall thei drew

till seizd with shame thei wheel about and face

the tuscan take their turn to fear and fly
so swell surg with a thundr roar

hi helpless lord cast backward on the ground

secur he fought exposd on evri part
a spaciou mark for sword and for the fly dart
across the shoulder came the featherd wound
transfixd he fell and doubl to the ground

and death with honour sought on either side
resistless thro the war camilla rode
in danger unappalld and pleasd with blood

and when too close pressd she quit the ground
from her bent bow she send a backward wound
her maid in martial pomp on either side
larina tulla fierc tarpeia ride
italian all in peac their queen delight
in war the bold companion of the fight
so marchd the thracian amazon of old
when thermodon with bloodi billow rolld
such troop as these in shine arm were seen
when theseu met in fight their maiden queen
such to the field penthesilea led
from the fierc virgin when the grecian fled
with such returnd triumphant from the war
her maid with cri attend the lofti car
thei clash with manli forc their mooni shield
with femal shout resound the phrygian field
who foremost and who last heroic maid
on the cold earth were by thy courag laid

with furi drivn from side to side transpiercd
a purpl stream came spout from the wound
bathd in hi blood he li and bite the ground
liri and pegasu at onc she slew
the former as the slackend rein he drew
of hi faint steed the latter as he stretchd
hi arm to prop hi friend the javlin reachd
by the same weapon sent from the same hand
both fall togeth and both spurn the sand
amastru next is ad to the slain

oer hi broad back an ox hide wa thrown

a covr for hi cheek and grinnd around hi head
he clenchd within hi hand an iron prong
and towerd abov the rest conspicu in the throng

and slew with eas then thu insult the slain
vain hunter didst thou think thro wood to chase
the savag herd a vile and trembl race
here ceas thy vaunt and own my victori
a woman warrior wa too strong for thee
yet if the ghost demand the conquror name

then bute and orsilochu she slew
the bulkiest bodi of the trojan crew
but bute breast to breast the spear descend
abov the gorget where hi helmet end

orsilochu and she their cours ply
he seem to follow and she seem to fly
but in a narrow ring she make the race
and then he fli and she pursu the chase

yet like a true ligurian born to cheat

cri out aloud what courag have you shown
who trust your courser strength and not your own
forego the vantag of your hors alight
and then on equal term begin the fight
it shall be seen weak woman what you can
when foot to foot you combat with a man
he said she glow with anger and disdain
dismount with speed to dare him on the plain
and leav her hors at larg among her train
with her drawn sword defi him to the field
and march lift aloft her maiden shield

with trojan blood th unhappi fight renewd
loud shout and clamour rend the liquid sky
and oer the field the fright latin fly
the princ disdain the dastard to pursu
nor move to meet in arm the fight few
turnu alon amid the duski plain
he seek and to the combat call in vain
juturna heard and seizd with mortal fear
forcd from the beam her brother chariot
assum hi shape hi armour and hi mien
and like metiscu in hi seat is seen
as the black swallow near the palac pli
oer empti court and under arch fli
now hawk aloft now skim along the flood
to furnish her loquaci nest with food
so drive the rapid goddess oer the plain
the smoke hors run with loosend rein
she steer a variou cours among the foe
now here now there her conqur brother show
now with a straight now with a wheel flight
she turn and bend but shun the singl fight
aenea fird with furi break the crowd
and seek hi foe and call by name aloud
he run within a narrow ring and tri
to stop the chariot but the chariot fli
if he but gain a glimps juturna fear
and far awai the daunian hero bear
what should he do nor art nor arm avail
and variou care in vain hi mind assail
the great messapu thundr thro the field
in hi left hand two point javlin held
encountr on the princ on dart he drew
and with uner aim and utmost vigour threw
aenea saw it come and stoop low
beneath hi buckler shunnd the threatn blow
the weapon hissd abov hi head and tore
the wave plume which on hi helm he wore
forc by thi hostil act and fird with spite
that fly turnu still declind the fight
the princ whose pieti had long repelld
hi inborn ardour now invad the field
invok the powr of violat peac
their rite and injurd altar to redress
then to hi rage abandon the rein
with blood and slaughterd bodi fill the plain
what god can tell what number can displai
the variou labour of that fatal dai
what chief and champion fell on either side
in combat slain or by what death thei di
whom turnu whom the trojan hero killd
who shard the fame and fortun of the field
jove couldst thou view and not avert thy sight
two jar nation joind in cruel fight
whom leagu of last love so shortli shall unit
aenea first rutulian sucro found
whose valour made the trojan quit their ground
betwixt hi rib the javlin drove so just
it reachd hi heart nor need a second thrust
now turnu at two blow two brethren slew
first from hi hors fierc amycu he threw
then leap on the ground on foot assaild
dior and in equal fight prevaild
their lifeless trunk he leav upon the place
their head distil gore hi chariot grace
three cold on earth the trojan hero threw
whom without respit at on charg he slew
cethegu tanai tagu fell oppressd
and sad onyth ad to the rest
of theban blood whom peridia bore
turnu two brother from the lycian shore
and from apollo fane to battl sent
oerthrew nor phoebu could their fate prevent
peac menoet after these he killd
who long had shunnd the danger of the field
on lerna lake a silent life he led
and with hi net and angl earnd hi bread
nor pompou care nor palac he knew
but wise from th infecti world withdrew
poor wa hi hous hi father pain hand
dischargd hi rent and plowd anoth land
as flame among the lofti wood ar thrown
on diffrent side and both by wind ar blown
the laurel crackl in the sputtr fire
the fright sylvan from their shade retir
or as two neighbr torrent fall from high
rapid thei run the foami water fry
thei roll to sea with unresist forc
and down the rock precipit their cours
not with less rage the rival hero take
their diffrent wai nor less destruct make
with spear afar with sword at hand thei strike
and zeal of slaughter fire their soul alik
like them their dauntless men maintain the field
and heart ar piercd unknow how to yield
thei blow for blow return and wound for wound
and heap of bodi rais the level ground
murranu boast of hi blood that spring
from a long royal race of latian king
is by the trojan from hi chariot thrown
crushd with the weight of an unwieldi stone
betwixt the wheel he fell the wheel that bore
hi live load hi dy bodi tore
hi start steed to shun the glittr sword
paw down hi trampl limb forget of their lord
fierc hyllu threatend high and face to face
affront turnu in the middl space
the princ encounterd him in full career
and at hi templ aimd the deadli spear
so fatal the fly weapon sped
that thro hi brazen helm it piercd hi head
nor cisseu couldst thou scape from turnu hand
in vain the strongest of th arcadian band
nor to cupentu could hi god afford
avail aid against th aenean sword
which to hi nake heart pursu the cours
nor could hi plate shield sustain the forc
iola fell whom not the grecian powr
nor great subvert of the trojan towr
were doomd to kill while heavn prolongd hi date
but who can pass the bound prefixd by fate
in high lyrnessu and in troi he held
two palac and wa from each expelld
of all the mighti man the last remain
a littl spot of foreign earth contain
and now both host their broken troop unit
in equal rank and mix in mortal fight
seresthu and undaunt mnestheu join
the trojan tuscan and arcadian line
seaborn messapu with atina head
the latin squadron and to battl lead
thei strike thei push thei throng the scanti space
resolvd on death impati of disgrac
and where on fall anoth fill hi place
the cyprian goddess now inspir her son
to leav th unfinishd fight and storm the town
for while he roll hi ey around the plain
in quest of turnu whom he seek in vain
he view th unguard citi from afar
in careless quiet and secur of war
occas offer and excit hi mind
to dare beyond the task he first designd
resolvd he call hi chief thei leav the fight
attend thu he take a neighbr height

then thu the lofti princ hear and obei

jove is with us and what i have decre
requir our utmost vigour and our speed
your instant arm against the town prepar
the sourc of mischief and the seat of war
thi dai the latian towr that mate the sky
shall level with the plain in ash lie
the peopl shall be slave unless in time
thei kneel for pardon and repent their crime
twice have our foe been vanquishd on the plain
then shall i wait till turnu will be slain
your forc against the perjurd citi bend
there it began and there the war shall end
the peac profand our right arm requir
cleans the pollut place with purg fire
he finishd and on soul inspir all
formd in a wedg the foot approach the wall
without the town an unprovid train
of gape gaze citizen ar slain
some firebrand other scale ladder bear
and those thei toss aloft and these thei rear
the flame now launchd the featherd arrow fly
and cloud of missiv arm obscur the sky
advanc to the front the hero stand
and stretch out to heavn hi piou hand
attest the god assert hi innoc
upbraid with breach of faith th ausonian princ
declar the royal honour doubli staind
and twice the rite of holi peac profand
dissent clamour in the town aris
each will be heard and all at onc advis
on part for peac and on for war contend
some would exclud their foe and some admit their friend
the helpless king is hurri in the throng
and whateer tide prevail is born along
thu when the swain within a hollow rock
invad the bee with suffoc smoke
thei run around or labour on their wing
disusd to flight and shoot their sleepi sting
to shun the bitter fume in vain thei try
black vapour issu from the vent involv the sky
but fate and enviou fortun now prepar
to plung the latin in the last despair
the queen who saw the foe invad the town
and brand on top of burn hous thrown
cast round her ey distract with her fear
no troop of turnu in the field appear
onc more she stare abroad but still in vain
and then conclud the royal youth is slain
mad with her anguish impot to bear
the mighti grief she loath the vital air
she call herself the caus of all thi ill
and own the dire effect of her ungovernd will
she rave against the god she beat her breast
she tear with both her hand her purpl vest
then round a beam a run noos she ti
and fastend by the neck obscen di
soon as the fatal new by fame wa blown
and to her dame and to her daughter known
the sad lavinia rend her yellow hair
and rosi cheek the rest her sorrow share
with shriek the palac ring and mad of despair
the spread rumour fill the public place
confus fear distract and disgrac
and silent shame ar seen in evri face
latinu tear hi garment as he goe
both for hi public and hi privat woe
with filth hi vener beard besmear
and sordid dust deform hi silver hair
and much he blame the soft of hi mind
obnoxi to the charm of womankind
and soon seducd to chang what he so well designd
to break the solemn leagu so long desird
nor finish what hi fate and those of troi requird
now turnu roll aloof oer empti plain
and here and there some straggl foe he glean
hi fly courser pleas him less and less
ashamd of easi fight and cheap success
thu halfcont anxiou in hi mind
the distant cri come drive in the wind
shout from the wall but shout in murmur drownd
a jar mixtur and a bode sound
ala said he what mean these dismal cri
what dole clamour from the town aris
confusd he stop and backward pull the rein
she who the driver offic now sustain
repli neglect my lord these new alarm
here fight and urg the fortun of your arm
there want not other to defend the wall
if by your rival hand th italian fall
so shall your fatal sword hi friend oppress
in honour equal equal in success
to thi the princ o sisterfor i knew
the peac infringd proceed first from you
i knew you when you mingl first in fight
and now in vain you would deceiv my sight
why goddess thi unprofit care
who sent you down from heavn involvd in air
your share of mortal sorrow to sustain
and see your brother bleed on the plain
for to what powr can turnu have recours
or how resist hi fate prevail forc
these ey beheld murranu bite the ground
mighti the man and mighti wa the wound
i heard my dearest friend with dy breath
my name invok to reveng hi death
brave ufen fell with honour on the place
to shun the shame sight of my disgrac
on earth supin a manli corps he li
hi vest and armour ar the victor prize
then shall i see laurentum in a flame
which onli want to complet my shame
how will the latin hoot their champion flight
how dranc will insult and point them to the sight
is death so hard to bear ye god below
sinc those abov so small compass show
receiv a soul unsulli yet with shame
which not beli my great forefath name
he said and while he spoke with fly speed
came sage urg on hi foami steed
fixd on hi wound face a shaft he bore
and seek turnu sent hi voic befor
turnu on you on you alon depend
our last relief compassion your friend
like lightn fierc aenea roll on
with arm invest with flame invad the town
the brand ar tossd on high the wind conspir
to drive along the delug of the fire
all ey ar fixd on you your foe rejoic
evn the king stagger and suspend hi choic
doubt to deliv or defend the town
whom to reject or whom to call hi son
the queen on whom your utmost hope were placd
herself suborn death ha breathd her last
ti true messapu fearless of hi fate
with fierc atina aid defend the gate
on evri side surround by the foe
the more thei kill the greater number grow
an iron harvest mount and still remain to mow
you far aloof from your forsaken band
your roll chariot drive oer empti sand
stupid he sate hi ey on earth declind
and variou care revolv in hi mind
rage boil from the bottom of hi breast
and sorrow mixd with shame hi soul oppressd
and consciou worth lai labr in hi thought
and love by jealousi to mad wrought
by slow degre hi reason drove awai
the mist of passion and resumd her swai
then rise on hi car he turnd hi look
and saw the town involvd in fire and smoke
a wooden towr with flame alreadi blazd
which hi own hand on beam and rafter raisd
and bridg laid abov to join the space
and wheel below to roll from place to place
sister the fate have vanquishd let us go
the wai which heavn and my hard fortun show
the fight is fixd nor shall the brand name
of a base coward blot your brother fame
death is my choic but suffer me to try
my forc and vent my rage befor i die
he said and leap down without delai
thro crowd of scatterd foe he freed hi wai
stride he passd impetu as the wind
and left the griev goddess far behind
as when a fragment from a mountain torn
by rage tempest or by torrent born
or sappd by time or loosend from the root
prone thro the void the rocki ruin shoot
roll from crag to crag from steep to steep
down sink at onc the shepherd and their sheep
involvd alik thei rush to nether ground
stunnd with the shock thei fall and stunnd from earth rebound
so turnu hast headlong to the town
shouldr and shove bore the squadron down
still press onward to the wall he drew
where shaft and spear and dart promiscu flew
and sanguin stream the slippri ground embru
first stretch out hi arm in sign of peac
he cri aloud to make the combat ceas
rutulian hold and latin troop retir
the fight is mine and me the god requir
ti just that i should vindic alon
the broken truce or for the breach aton
thi dai shall free from war th ausonian state
or finish my misfortun in my fate
both armi from their bloodi work desist
and bear backward form a spaciou list
the trojan hero who receivd from fame
the welcom sound and heard the champion name
soon leav the taken work and mount wall
greedi of war where greater glori call
he spring to fight exult in hi forc
hi joint armour rattl in the cours
like eryx or like atho great he show
or father apennin when white with snow
hi head divin obscur in cloud he hide
and shake the sound forest on hi side
the nation overawd surceas the fight
immov their bodi fixd their sight
evn death stand still nor from abov thei throw
their dart nor drive their battringram below
in silent order either armi stand
and drop their sword unknow from their hand
th ausonian king behold with wondr sight
two mighti champion matchd in singl fight
born under clime remot and brought by fate
with sword to try their titl to the state
now in closd field each other from afar
thei view and rush on begin the war
thei launch their spear then hand to hand thei meet
the trembl soil resound beneath their feet
their buckler clash thick blow descend from high
and flake of fire from their hard helmet fly
courag conspir with chanc and both engag
with equal fortun yet and mutual rage
as when two bull for their fair femal fight
in sila shade or on taburnu height
with horn advers thei meet the keeper fli
mute stand the herd the heifer roll their ey
and wait th event which victor thei shall bear
and who shall be the lord to rule the lusti year
with rage of love the jealou rival burn
and push for push and wound for wound return
their dewlap gord their side ar lavd in blood
loud cri and roar sound rebellow thro the wood
such wa the combat in the list ground
so clash their sword and so their shield resound
jove set the beam in either scale he lai
the champion fate and each exactli weigh
on thi side life and lucki chanc ascend
load with death that other scale descend
raisd on the stretch young turnu aim a blow
full on the helm of hi unguard foe
shrill shout and clamour ring on either side
as hope and fear their pant heart divid
but all in piec fli the traitor sword
and in the middl stroke desert hi lord
now is but death or flight disarmd he fli
when in hi hand an unknown hilt he spi
fame sai that turnu when hi steed he joind
hurri to war disorderd in hi mind
snatchd the first weapon which hi hast could find
twa not the fate sword hi father bore
but that hi chariot metiscu wore
thi while the trojan fled the tough held
but vain against the great vulcanian shield
the mortaltemperd steel deceivd hi hand
the shiverd fragment shone amid the sand
surprisd with fear he fled along the field
and now forthright and now in orbit wheeld
for here the trojan troop the list surround
and there the pass is closd with pool and marshi ground
aenea hasten tho with heavier pace
hi wound so newli knit retard the chase
and oft hi trembl knee their aid refus
yet press foot by foot hi foe pursu
thu when a fear stag is closd around
with crimson toil or in a river found
high on the bank the deepmouthd hound appear
still open follow still whereer he steer
the persecut creatur to and fro
turn here and there to scape hi umbrian foe
steep is th ascent and if he gain the land
the purpl death is pitchd along the strand
hi eager foe determind to the chase
stretchd at hi length gain ground at evri pace
now to hi beami head he make hi wai
and now he hold or think he hold hi prei
just at the pinch the stag spring out with fear
he bite the wind and fill hi sound jaw with air
the rock the lake the meadow ring with cri
the mortal tumult mount and thunder in the ski
thu fli the daunian princ and fly blame
hi tardi troop and call by their name
demand hi trusti sword the trojan threat
the realm with ruin and their ancient seat
to lai in ash if thei dare suppli
with arm or aid hi vanquishd enemi
thu menac he still pursu the cours
with vigour tho diminishd of hi forc
ten time alreadi round the list place
on chief had fled and t other givn the chase
no trivial prize is playd for on the life
or death of turnu now depend the strife
within the space an oliv tree had stood
a sacr shade a vener wood
for vow to faunu paid the latin guardian god
here hung the vest and tablet were engravd
of sink marin from shipwreck savd
with heedless hand the trojan felld the tree
to make the ground enclosd for combat free
deep in the root whether by fate or chanc
or er hast the trojan drove hi lanc
then stoopd and tuggd with forc immens to free
th incumberd spear from the tenaci tree
that whom hi faint limb pursu in vain
hi fly weapon might from far attain
confusd with fear bereft of human aid
then turnu to the god and first to faunu prayd
o faunu piti and thou mother earth
where i thy foster son receivd my birth
hold fast the steel if my religi hand
your plant ha honourd which your foe profand
propiti hear my piou prayr he said
nor with successless vow invokd their aid
th incumb hero wrenchd and pulld and straind
but still the stubborn earth the steel detaind
juturna took her time and while in vain
he strove assumd meticu form again
and in that imit shape restord
to the despair princ hi daunian sword
the queen of love who with disdain and grief
saw the bold nymph afford thi prompt relief
t assert her offspr with a greater deed
from the tough root the lingr weapon freed
onc more erect the rival chief advanc
on trust the sword and on the point lanc
and both resolvd alik to try their fatal chanc
meantim imperi jove to juno spoke
who from a shine cloud beheld the shock
what new arrest o queen of heavn is sent
to stop the fate now labr in th event
what farther hope ar left thee to pursu
divin aenea and thou knowst it too
foredoomd to these celesti seat ar due
what more attempt for turnu can be made
that thu thou lingrest in thi lone shade
is it becom of the due respect
and aw honour of a god elect
a wound unworthi of our state to feel
patient of human hand and earthli steel
or seem it just the sister should restor
a second sword when on wa lost befor
and arm a conquerd wretch against hi conqueror
for what without thy knowledg and avow
nai more thy dictat durst juturna do
at last in defer to my love forbear
to lodg within thy soul thi anxiou care
reclind upon my breast thy grief unload
who should reliev the goddess but the god
now all thing to their utmost issu tend
pushd by the fate to their appoint end
while leav wa givn thee and a law hour
for vengeanc wrath and unresist powr
tossd on the sea thou couldst thy foe distress
and drivn ashor with hostil arm oppress
deform the royal hous and from the side
of the just bridegroom tear the plight bride
now ceas at my command the thundrer said
and with deject ey thi answer juno made
becaus your dread decre too well i knew
from turnu and from earth unwil i withdrew
els should you not behold me here alon
involvd in empti cloud my friend bemoan
but girt with veng flame in open sight
engagd against my foe in mortal fight
ti true juturna mingl in the strife
by my command to save her brother life
at least to try but by the stygian lake
the most religi oath the god can take
with thi restrict not to bend the bow
or toss the spear or trembl dart to throw
and now resignd to your superior might
and tird with fruitless toil i loath the fight
thi let me beg and thi no fate withstand
both for myself and for your father land
that when the nuptial bed shall bind the peac
which i sinc you ordain consent to bless
the law of either nation be the same
but let the latin still retain their name
speak the same languag which thei spoke befor
wear the same habit which their grandsir wore
call them not trojan perish the renown
and name of troi with that detest town
latium be latium still let alba reign
and rome immort majesti remain
then thu the founder of mankind repli
unruffl wa hi front seren hi ey
can saturn issu and heavn other heir
such endless anger in her bosom bear
be mistress and your full desir obtain
but quench the choler you foment in vain
from ancient blood th ausonian peopl sprung
shall keep their name their habit and their tongu
the trojan to their custom shall be ti
i will myself their common rite provid
the nativ shall command the foreign subsid
all shall be latium troi without a name
and her lost son forget from whenc thei came
from blood so mixd a piou race shall flow
equal to god excel all below
no nation more respect to you shall pai
or greater offr on your altar lai
juno consent well pleasd that her desir
had found success and from the cloud retir
the peac thu made the thundrer next prepar
to forc the watri goddess from the war
deep in the dismal region void of light
three daughter at a birth were born to night
these their brown mother brood on her care
indu with windi wing to flit in air
with serpent girt alik and crownd with hiss hair

spring the swift arrow from the parthian bow
or cydon yew when travers the ski
and drenchd in poisnou juic the sure destruct fli
with such a sudden and unseen a flight
shot thro the cloud the daughter of the night
soon as the field inclosd she had in view
and from afar her destind quarri knew
contract to the bode bird she turn
which haunt the ruind pile and hallowd urn
and beat about the tomb with nightli wing
where song obscen on sepulch she sing
thu lessend in her form with fright cri
the furi round unhappi turnu fli
flap on hi shield and flutter oer hi ey
a lazi chill crept along hi blood
chokd wa hi voic hi hair with horror stood
juturna from afar beheld her fly
and knew th ill omen by her scream cry
and stridor of her wing amazd with fear
her beauteou breast she beat and rent her flow hair
ah me she cri in thi unequ strife
what can thy sister more to save thy life
weak as i am can i ala contend
in arm with that inexor fiend
now now i quit the field forbear to fright
my tender soul ye bale bird of night
the lash of your wing i know too well
the sound flight and funral scream of hell
these ar the gift you bring from haughti jove
the worthi recompens of ravishd love
did he for thi exempt my life from fate
o hard condit of immort state
tho born to death not privilegd to die
but forcd to bear imposd etern
take back your enviou bribe and let me go
companion to my brother ghost below
the joi ar vanishd noth now remain
of life immort but immort pain
what earth will open her devour womb
to rest a weari goddess in the tomb
she drew a length of sigh nor more she said
but in her azur mantl wrappd her head
then plungd into her stream with deep despair
and her last sob came bubbl up in air
now stern aenea wave hi weighti spear
against hi foe and thu upbraid hi fear
what farther subterfug can turnu find
what empti hope ar harbourd in hi mind
ti not thy swift can secur thy flight
not with their feet but hand the valiant fight
vari thy shape in thousand form and dare
what skill and courag can attempt in war
wish for the wing of wind to mount the sky
or hid within the hollow earth to lie
the champion shook hi head and made thi short repli
no threat of thine my manli mind can move
ti hostil heavn i dread and partial jove
he said no more but with a sigh repressd
the mighti sorrow in hi swell breast
then as he rolld hi troubl ey around
an antiqu stone he saw the common bound
of neighbr field and barrier of the ground
so vast that twelv strong men of modern dai
th enorm weight from earth could hardli rais
he heavd it at a lift and poisd on high
ran staggr on against hi enemi
but so disorderd that he scarc knew
hi wai or what unwieldli weight he threw
hi knock knee ar bent beneath the load
and shivr cold congeal hi vital blood
the stone drop from hi arm and fall short
for want of vigour mock hi vain effort
and as when heavi sleep ha closd the sight
the sickli fanci labour in the night
we seem to run and destitut of forc
our sink limb forsak us in the cours
in vain we heav for breath in vain we cry
the nerv unbracd their usual strength deni
and on the tongu the faltr accent die
so turnu fard whatev mean he tri
all forc of arm and point of art employd
the furi flew athwart and made th endeavor void
a thousand variou thought hi soul confound
he stard about nor aid nor issu found
hi own men stop the pass and hi own wall surround
onc more he paus and look out again
and seek the goddess chariot in vain
trembl he view the thundr chief advanc
and brandish aloft the deadli lanc
amazd he cowr beneath hi conqur foe
forget to ward and wait the come blow
astonishd while he stand and fixd with fear
aimd at hi shield he see th impend spear
the hero measurd first with narrow view
the destind mark and rise as he threw
with it full swing the fatal weapon flew
not with less rage the rattl thunder fall
or stone from battringengin break the wall
swift as a whirlwind from an arm so strong
the lanc drove on and bore the death along
naught could hi sevnfold shield the princ avail
nor aught beneath hi arm the coat of mail
it piercd thro all and with a grisli wound
transfixd hi thigh and doubl him to ground
with groan the latin rend the vault sky
wood hill and vallei to the voic repli
now low on earth the lofti chief is laid
with ey cast upward and with arm displayd
and recreant thu to the proud victor prayd
i know my death deservd nor hope to live

yet think o think if merci mai be shown
thou hadst a father onc and hast a son
piti my sire now sink to the grave
and for anchis sake old daunu save
or if thy vowd reveng pursu my death
give to my friend my bodi void of breath
the latian chief have seen me beg my life
thine is the conquest thine the royal wife
against a yield man ti mean ignobl strife
in deep suspens the trojan seemd to stand
and just prepard to strike repressd hi hand
he rolld hi ey and evri moment felt
hi manli soul with more compass melt
when cast down a casual glanc he spi
the golden belt that glitterd on hi side
the fatal spoil which haughti turnu tore

flame while he spoke came flash from hi ey
traitor dost thou dost thou to grace pretend

deep in hi bosom drove the shine sword
