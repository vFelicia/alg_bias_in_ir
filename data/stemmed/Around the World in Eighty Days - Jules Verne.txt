in which philea fogg and passepartout accept each other the on as
master the other as man
mr philea fogg live in 1872 at no 7 savil row burlington
garden the hous in which sheridan di in 1814 he wa on of the
most notic member of the reform club though he seem alwai to
avoid attract attent an enigmat personag about whom littl
wa known except that he wa a polish man of the world peopl said
that he resembl byronat least that hi head wa byron but he wa
a beard tranquil byron who might live on a thousand year without
grow old
certainli an englishman it wa more doubt whether philea fogg wa
a london he wa never seen on chang nor at the bank nor in the
countingroom of the citi no ship ever came into london dock of
which he wa the owner he had no public employ he had never been
enter at ani of the inn of court either at the templ or lincoln
inn or grai inn nor had hi voic ever resound in the court of
chanceri or in the exchequ or the queen bench or the
ecclesiast court he certainli wa not a manufactur nor wa he
a merchant or a gentleman farmer hi name wa strang to the
scientif and learn societi and he never wa known to take part
in the sage deliber of the royal institut or the london
institut the artisan associ or the institut of art and
scienc he belong in fact to none of the numer societi which
swarm in the english capit from the harmon to that of the
entomologist found mainli for the purpos of abolish pernici
insect
philea fogg wa a member of the reform and that wa all
the wai in which he got admiss to thi exclus club wa simpl
enough
he wa recommend by the bare with whom he had an open credit hi
chequ were regularli paid at sight from hi account current which
wa alwai flush
wa philea fogg rich undoubtedli but those who knew him best could
not imagin how he had made hi fortun and mr fogg wa the last
person to whom to appli for the inform he wa not lavish nor on
the contrari avarici for whenev he knew that monei wa need
for a nobl us or benevol purpos he suppli it quietli and
sometim anonym he wa in short the least commun of
men he talk veri littl and seem all the more mysteri for hi
taciturn manner hi daili habit were quit open to observ but
whatev he did wa so exactli the same thing that he had alwai done
befor that the wit of the curiou were fairli puzzl
had he travel it wa like for no on seem to know the world
more familiarli there wa no spot so seclud that he did not appear
to have an intim acquaint with it he often correct with a
few clear word the thousand conjectur advanc by member of the
club as to lost and unheardof travel point out the true
probabl and seem as if gift with a sort of second sight so
often did event justifi hi predict he must have travel
everywher at least in the spirit
it wa at least certain that philea fogg had not absent himself from
london for mani year those who were honour by a better acquaint
with him than the rest declar that nobodi could pretend to have ever
seen him anywher els hi sole pastim were read the paper and
plai whist he often won at thi game which as a silent on
harmonis with hi natur but hi win never went into hi purs
be reserv as a fund for hi chariti mr fogg plai not to
win but for the sake of plai the game wa in hi ey a contest a
struggl with a difficulti yet a motionless unweari struggl
congeni to hi tast
philea fogg wa not known to have either wife or children which mai
happen to the most honest peopl either rel or near friend
which is certainli more unusu he live alon in hi hous in savil
row whither none penetr a singl domest suffic to serv him
he breakfast and dine at the club at hour mathemat fix in
the same room at the same tabl never take hi meal with other
member much less bring a guest with him and went home at exactli
midnight onli to retir at onc to bed he never us the cosi
chamber which the reform provid for it favour member he pass
ten hour out of the twentyfour in savil row either in sleep or
make hi toilet when he chose to take a walk it wa with a regular
step in the entranc hall with it mosaic floor or in the circular
galleri with it dome support by twenti red porphyri ionic column
and illumin by blue paint window when he breakfast or dine all
the resourc of the clubit kitchen and pantri it butteri and
dairyaid to crowd hi tabl with their most succul store he wa
serv by the gravest waiter in dress coat and shoe with swanskin
sole who proffer the viand in special porcelain and on the finest
linen club decant of a lost mould contain hi sherri hi port
and hi cinnamonsp claret while hi beverag were refreshingli
cool with ic brought at great cost from the american lake
if to live in thi style is to be eccentr it must be confess that
there is someth good in eccentr
the mansion in savil row though not sumptuou wa exceedingli
comfort the habit of it occup were such as to demand but
littl from the sole domest but philea fogg requir him to be
almost superhumanli prompt and regular on thi veri 2nd of octob he
had dismiss jame forster becaus that luckless youth had brought
him shavingwat at eightyfour degre fahrenheit instead of
eightysix and he wa await hi successor who wa due at the hous
between eleven and halfpast

togeth like those of a grenadi on parad hi hand rest on hi
knee hi bodi straight hi head erect he wa steadili watch a
complic clock which indic the hour the minut the second

madam tussaud as live as my new master
madam tussaud peopl let it be said ar of wax and ar much
visit in london speech is all that is want to make them human
dure hi brief interview with mr fogg passepartout had been
carefulli observ him he appear to be a man about forti year of
ag with fine handsom featur and a tall wellshap figur hi
hair and whisker were light hi forehead compact and unwrinkl hi
face rather pale hi teeth magnific hi counten possess in
the highest degre what physiognomist call repos in action a
qualiti of those who act rather than talk calm and phlegmat with a
clear ey mr fogg seem a perfect type of that english composur
which angelica kauffmann ha so skilfulli repres on canva seen
in the variou phase of hi daili life he gave the idea of be
perfectli wellbalanc as exactli regul as a leroi chronomet
philea fogg wa inde exactitud personifi and thi wa betrai
even in the express of hi veri hand and feet for in men as well
as in anim the limb themselv ar express of the passion
he wa so exact that he wa never in a hurri wa alwai readi and wa
econom alik of hi step and hi motion he never took on step
too mani and alwai went to hi destin by the shortest cut he
made no superflu gestur and wa never seen to be move or
agit he wa the most deliber person in the world yet alwai
reach hi destin at the exact moment
he live alon and so to speak outsid of everi social relat and
as he knew that in thi world account must be taken of friction and
that friction retard he never rub against anybodi
as for passepartout he wa a true parisian of pari sinc he had
abandon hi own countri for england take servic as a valet he
had in vain search for a master after hi own heart passepartout wa

somewhat tumbl for while the ancient sculptor ar said to have
known eighteen method of arrang minerva tress passepartout wa
familiar with but on of dress hi own three stroke of a
largetooth comb complet hi toilet
it would be rash to predict how passepartout live natur would
agre with mr fogg it wa imposs to tell whether the new servant
would turn out as absolut method as hi master requir
experi alon could solv the question passepartout had been a sort
of vagrant in hi earli year and now yearn for repos but so far
he had fail to find it though he had alreadi serv in ten english
hous but he could not take root in ani of these with chagrin he
found hi master invari whimsic and irregular constantli
run about the countri or on the lookout for adventur hi last
master young lord longferri member of parliament after pass hi
night in the haymarket tavern wa too often brought home in the
morn on policemen shoulder passepartout desir of respect

unbroken regular that he neither travel nor stai from home
overnight he felt sure that thi would be the place he wa after he

morn exactli at which hour philea fogg rose till halfpast
eleven when he left the hous for the reform clubal the detail of

to it member from the club it soon got into the paper throughout
england the boast tour of the world wa talk about disput
argu with as much warmth as if the subject were anoth alabama
claim some took side with philea fogg but the larg major shook
their head and declar against him it wa absurd imposs thei
declar that the tour of the world could be made except

devot to philea fogg ventur were eagerli devour by all class
of reader at first some rash individu princip of the gentler
sex espous hi caus which becam still more popular when the
illustr london new came out with hi portrait copi from a
photograph in the reform club a few reader of the daili telegraph
even dare to sai why not after all stranger thing have come to
pass
at last a long articl appear on the 7th of octob in the bulletin
of the royal geograph societi which treat the question from
everi point of view and demonstr the utter folli of the
enterpris
everyth it said wa against the travel everi obstacl impos
alik by man and by natur a miracul agreement of the time of

to hi success he might perhap reckon on the arriv of train at

liabil of train to run off the line collis bad weather the
block up by snowwer not all these against philea fogg would he
not find himself when travel by steamer in winter at the merci of
the wind and fog is it uncommon for the best ocean steamer to be
two or three dai behind time but a singl delai would suffic to
fatal break the chain of commun should philea fogg onc
miss even by an hour a steamer he would have to wait for the next
and that would irrevoc render hi attempt vain
thi articl made a great deal of nois and be copi into all the
paper serious depress the advoc of the rash tourist
everybodi know that england is the world of bet men who ar of a
higher class than mere gambler to bet is in the english tempera

fogg when the folli as well as the useless of the adventur wa
point out to him he content himself with repli if the thing

the fogg parti dwindl more and more everybodi wa go against him
and the bet stood a hundr and fifti and two hundr to on and a
week after hi departur an incid occur which depriv him of

world on the pretext of a wager he had had no other end in view than
to elud the detect and throw them off hi track
chapter vi
in which fix the detect betrai a veri natur impati
the circumst under which thi telegraph dispatch about philea
fogg wa sent were as follow
the steamer mongolia belong to the peninsular and orient
compani built of iron of two thousand eight hundr ton burden and
five hundr horsepow wa due at eleven oclock am on wednesdai
the 9th of octob at suez the mongolia pli regularli between
brindisi and bombai vi the suez canal and wa on of the fastest
steamer belong to the compani alwai make more than ten knot an
hour between brindisi and suez and nine and a half between suez and
bombai
two men were promenad up and down the wharv among the crowd of
nativ and stranger who were sojourn at thi onc straggl
villagenow thank to the enterpris of m lessep a fastgrow
town on wa the british consul at suez who despit the propheci
of the english govern and the unfavour predict of
stephenson wa in the habit of see from hi offic window english
ship daili pass to and fro on the great canal by which the old
roundabout rout from england to india by the cape of good hope wa
abridg by at least a half the other wa a small slightbuilt
personag with a nervou intellig face and bright ey peer
out from under eyebrow which he wa incessantli twitch he wa just
now manifest unmistak sign of impati nervous pace up
and down and unabl to stand still for a moment thi wa fix on of
the detect who had been dispatch from england in search of the
bank robber it wa hi task to narrowli watch everi passeng who
arriv at suez and to follow up all who seem to be suspici
charact or bore a resembl to the descript of the crimin
which he had receiv two dai befor from the polic headquart at
london the detect wa evid inspir by the hope of obtain
the splendid reward which would be the prize of success and await
with a feverish impati easi to understand the arriv of the
steamer mongolia
so you sai consul ask he for the twentieth time that thi
steamer is never behind time
no mr fix repli the consul she wa bespoken yesterdai at port
said and the rest of the wai is of no account to such a craft i
repeat that the mongolia ha been in advanc of the time requir by
the compani regul and gain the prize award for excess of
speed
doe she come directli from brindisi
directli from brindisi she take on the indian mail there and she
left there saturdai at five pm have patienc mr fix she will not
be late but realli i dont see how from the descript you have
you will be abl to recognis your man even if he is on board the
mongolia
a man rather feel the presenc of these fellow consul than
recognis them you must have a scent for them and a scent is like a
sixth sens which combin hear see and smell iv arrest
more than on of these gentlemen in my time and if my thief is on
board ill answer for it hell not slip through my finger
i hope so mr fix for it wa a heavi robberi
a magnific robberi consul fiftyf thousand pound we dont
often have such windfal burglar ar get to be so contempt
nowadai a fellow get hung for a hand of shill
mr fix said the consul i like your wai of talk and hope
youll succe but i fear you will find it far from easi dont you
see the descript which you have there ha a singular resembl to
an honest man
consul remark the detect dogmat great robber alwai
resembl honest folk fellow who have rascal face have onli on
cours to take and that is to remain honest otherwis thei would be
arrest offhand the artist thing is to unmask honest
counten it no light task i admit but a real art
mr fix evid wa not want in a ting of selfconceit
littl by littl the scene on the quai becam more anim sailor of
variou nation merchant shipbrok porter fellah bustl to
and fro as if the steamer were immedi expect the weather wa
clear and slightli chilli the minaret of the town loom abov the
hous in the pale rai of the sun a jetti pier some two thousand
yard along extend into the roadstead a number of fishingsmack
and coast boat some retain the fantast fashion of ancient
gallei were discern on the red sea
as he pass among the busi crowd fix accord to habit scrutinis
the passersbi with a keen rapid glanc
it wa now halfpast ten
the steamer doesnt come he exclaim as the port clock struck
she cant be far off now return hi companion
how long will she stop at suez
four hour long enough to get in her coal it is thirteen hundr and
ten mile from suez to aden at the other end of the red sea and she
ha to take in a fresh coal suppli
and doe she go from suez directli to bombai
without put in anywher
good said fix if the robber is on board he will no doubt get off
at suez so as to reach the dutch or french coloni in asia by some
other rout he ought to know that he would not be safe an hour in
india which is english soil
unless object the consul he is exception shrewd an english
crimin you know is alwai better conceal in london than anywher
els
thi observ furnish the detect food for thought and
meanwhil the consul went awai to hi offic fix left alon wa more
impati than ever have a presenti that the robber wa on board
the mongolia if he had inde left london intend to reach the new
world he would natur take the rout vi india which wa less
watch and more difficult to watch than that of the atlant but
fix reflect were soon interrupt by a success of sharp
whistl which announc the arriv of the mongolia the porter
and fellah rush down the quai and a dozen boat push off from the
shore to go and meet the steamer soon her gigant hull appear
pass along between the bank and eleven oclock struck as she
anchor in the road she brought an unusu number of passeng some
of whom remain on deck to scan the picturesqu panorama of the town
while the greater part disembark in the boat and land on the

fix took up a posit and carefulli examin each face and figur
which made it appear present on of the passeng after
vigor push hi wai through the importun crowd of porter

consul offic where he wa at onc admit to the presenc of that
offici
consul said he without preambl i have strong reason for
believ that my man is a passeng on the mongolia and he
narrat what had just pass concern the passport
well mr fix repli the consul i shall not be sorri to see the
rascal face but perhap he wont come herethat is if he is the
person you suppos him to be a robber doesnt quit like to leav
trace of hi flight behind him and besid he is not oblig to

if he is as shrewd as i think he is consul he will come
to have hi passport visa
ye passport ar onli good for annoi honest folk and aid in
the flight of rogu i assur you it will be quit the thing for him
to do but i hope you will not visa the passport
why not if the passport is genuin i have no right to refus
still i must keep thi man here until i can get a warrant to arrest
him from london
ah that your lookout but i cannot
the consul did not finish hi sentenc for as he spoke a knock wa
heard at the door and two stranger enter on of whom wa the
servant whom fix had met on the quai the other who wa hi master
held out hi passport with the request that the consul would do him the
favour to visa it the consul took the document and carefulli read

sir franci cromarti had observ the odditi of hi travel
companionalthough the onli opportun he had for studi him had
been while he wa deal the card and between two rubbersand
question himself whether a human heart realli beat beneath thi cold

the eccentr person he had ever met none wa compar to thi
product of the exact scienc
philea fogg had not conceal from sir franci hi design of go

how so sir franci
becaus the railwai stop at the base of these mountain which the

kandallah on the other side
such a delai would not have derang my plan in the least said mr

insert it in kiouni trunk who receiv it without in the least
slacken hi regular trot
after two hour the guid stop the eleph and gave him an hour

mountain fast the travel sever time saw band of
feroci indian who when thei perceiv the eleph stride
acrosscountri made angri and threaten motion the parse avoid
them as much as possibl few anim were observ on the rout even
the monkei hurri from their path with contort and grimac which
convuls passepartout with laughter
in the midst of hi gaieti howev on thought troubl the worthi
servant what would mr fogg do with the eleph when he got to
allahabad would he carri him on with him imposs the cost of
transport him would make him ruinous expens would he sell him
or set him free the estim beast certainli deserv some
consider should mr fogg choos to make him passepartout a

thought did not ceas worri him for a long time
the princip chain of the vindhia wa cross by eight in the

bungalow thei had gone nearli twentyf mile that dai and an equal
distanc still separ them from the station of allahabad
the night wa cold the parse lit a fire in the bungalow with a few
dry branch and the warmth wa veri grate provis purchas at
kholbi suffic for supper and the travel at raven the
convers begin with a few disconnect phrase soon gave
place to loud and steadi snore the guid watch kiouni who slept

as succul as cream wa ampli partaken of and appreci
at two oclock the guid enter a thick forest which extend sever

of be successfulli accomplish when the eleph becom
restless suddenli stop
it wa then four oclock
what the matter ask sir franci put out hi head
i dont know offic repli the parse listen attent to a
confus murmur which came through the thick branch
the murmur soon becam more distinct it now seem like a distant
concert of human voic accompani by brass instrument passepartout
wa all ey and ear mr fogg patient wait without a word the
parse jump to the ground fasten the eleph to a tree and
plung into the thicket he soon return sai
a process of brahmin is come thi wai we must prevent their
see us if possibl
the guid unloos the eleph and led him into a thicket at the same
time ask the travel not to stir he held himself readi to
bestrid the anim at a moment notic should flight becom
necessari but he evid thought that the process of the faith
would pass without perceiv them amid the thick foliag in which
thei were wholli conceal
the discord tone of the voic and instrument drew nearer and now
drone song mingl with the sound of the tambourin and cymbal
the head of the process soon appear beneath the tree a hundr
pace awai and the strang figur who perform the religi
ceremoni were easili distinguish through the branch first came the
priest with mitr on their head and cloth in long lace robe
thei were surround by men women and children who sang a kind of
lugubri psalm interrupt at regular interv by the tambourin

the parse made a motion to keep silenc
a group of old fakir were caper and make a wild ado round the
statu these were stripe with ochr and cover with cut whenc
their blood issu drop by dropstupid fanat who in the great
indian ceremoni still throw themselv under the wheel of
juggernaut some brahmin clad in all the sumptuous of orient

young woman wa imprison could thei enter ani of it door while the
whole parti of indian wa plung in a drunken sleep or wa it safer
to attempt to make a hole in the wall thi could onli be determin
at the moment and the place themselv but it wa certain that the
abduct must be made that night and not when at break of dai the
victim wa led to her funer pyre then no human intervent could
save her
as soon as night fell about six oclock thei decid to make a
reconnaiss around the pagoda the cri of the fakir were just
ceas the indian were in the act of plung themselv into the
drunken caus by liquid opium mingl with hemp and it might be
possibl to slip between them to the templ itself
the parse lead the other noiselessli crept through the wood and
in ten minut thei found themselv on the bank of a small stream
whenc by the light of the rosin torch thei perceiv a pyre of

the parse now convinc that it wa imposs to forc an entranc
to the templ advanc no farther but led hi companion back again
philea fogg and sir franci cromarti also saw that noth could be

the glare of the torch and a dim light crept through the window of
the pagoda
thei wait till midnight but no chang took place among the guard
and it becam appar that their yield to sleep could not be
count on the other plan must be carri out an open in the wall
of the pagoda must be made it remain to ascertain whether the
priest were watch by the side of their victim as assidu as

him
the rangoonon of the peninsular and orient compani boat ply
in the chines and japanes seaswa a screw steamer built of iron
weigh about seventeen hundr and seventi ton and with engin of
four hundr horsepow she wa as fast but not as well fit up
as the mongolia and aouda wa not as comfort provid for on
board of her as philea fogg could have wish howev the trip from
calcutta to hong kong onli compris some three thousand five hundr
mile occupi from ten to twelv dai and the young woman wa not
difficult to pleas
dure the first dai of the journei aouda becam better acquaint
with her protector and constantli gave evid of her deep gratitud
for what he had done the phlegmat gentleman listen to her
appar at least with cold neither hi voic nor hi manner
betrai the slightest emot but he seem to be alwai on the
watch that noth should be want to aouda comfort he visit her
regularli each dai at certain hour not so much to talk himself as to
sit and hear her talk he treat her with the strictest polit
but with the precis of an automaton the movement of which had been
arrang for thi purpos aouda did not quit know what to make of
him though passepartout had given her some hint of hi master
eccentr and made her smile by tell her of the wager which wa
send him round the world after all she ow philea fogg her life
and she alwai regard him through the exalt medium of her
gratitud
aouda confirm the parse guid narr of her touch histori
she did inde belong to the highest of the nativ race of india
mani of the parse merchant have made great fortun there by deal
in cotton and on of them sir jametse jeejeebhoi wa made a baronet
by the english govern aouda wa a rel of thi great man and
it wa hi cousin jeejeeh whom she hope to join at hong kong
whether she would find a protector in him she could not tell but mr
fogg essai to calm her anxieti and to assur her that everyth
would be mathematicallyh us the veri wordarrang aouda fasten
her great ey clear as the sacr lake of the himalaya upon him
but the intract fogg as reserv as ever did not seem at all
inclin to throw himself into thi lake
the first few dai of the voyag pass prosper amid favour
weather and propiti wind and thei soon came in sight of the great
andaman the princip of the island in the bai of bengal with it
picturesqu saddl peak two thousand four hundr feet high loom
abov the water the steamer pass along near the shore but the
savag papuan who ar in the lowest scale of human but ar not
as ha been assert cannib did not make their appear
the panorama of the island as thei steam by them wa superb vast
forest of palm arec bamboo teakwood of the gigant mimosa and
treelik fern cover the foreground while behind the grace
outlin of the mountain were trace against the sky and along the
coast swarm by thousand the preciou swallow whose nest furnish a
luxuri dish to the tabl of the celesti empir the vari
landscap afford by the andaman island wa soon pass howev and
the rangoon rapidli approach the strait of malacca which gave
access to the china sea
what wa detect fix so unluckili drawn on from countri to countri
do all thi while he had manag to embark on the rangoon at
calcutta without be seen by passepartout after leav order that
if the warrant should arriv it should be forward to him at hong
kong and he hope to conceal hi presenc to the end of the voyag it
would have been difficult to explain why he wa on board without
awaken passepartout suspicion who thought him still at bombai
but necess impel him nevertheless to renew hi acquaint
with the worthi servant as will be seen
all the detect hope and wish were now centr on hong kong for
the steamer stai at singapor would be too brief to enabl him to
take ani step there the arrest must be made at hong kong or the
robber would probabl escap him for ever hong kong wa the last
english ground on which he would set foot beyond china japan
america offer to fogg an almost certain refug if the warrant should
at last make it appear at hong kong fix could arrest him and give
him into the hand of the local polic and there would be no further
troubl but beyond hong kong a simpl warrant would be of no avail
an extradit warrant would be necessari and that would result in
delai and obstacl of which the rascal would take advantag to elud
justic
fix thought over these probabl dure the long hour which he
spent in hi cabin and kept repeat to himself now either the
warrant will be at hong kong in which case i shall arrest my man or
it will not be there and thi time it is absolut necessari that i
should delai hi departur i have fail at bombai and i have fail
at calcutta if i fail at hong kong my reput is lost cost what
it mai i must succe but how shall i prevent hi departur if
that should turn out to be my last resourc
fix made up hi mind that if worst came to worst he would make a
confid of passepartout and tell him what kind of a fellow hi
master realli wa that passepartout wa not fogg accomplic he wa
veri certain the servant enlighten by hi disclosur and afraid of
be himself implic in the crime would doubtless becom an alli
of the detect but thi method wa a danger on onli to be
emploi when everyth els had fail a word from passepartout to
hi master would ruin all the detect wa therefor in a sore
strait but suddenli a new idea struck him the presenc of aouda on
the rangoon in compani with philea fogg gave him new materi for
reflect
who wa thi woman what combin of event had made her fogg
travel companion thei had evid met somewher between bombai
and calcutta but where had thei met accident or had fogg gone
into the interior purpos in quest of thi charm damsel fix wa
fairli puzzl he ask himself whether there had not been a wick
elop and thi idea so impress itself upon hi mind that he
determin to make us of the suppos intrigu whether the young
woman were marri or not he would be abl to creat such difficulti
for mr fogg at hong kong that he could not escap by pai ani amount
of monei
but could he even wait till thei reach hong kong fogg had an
abomin wai of jump from on boat to anoth and befor
anyth could be effect might get full under wai again for
yokohama
fix decid that he must warn the english author and signal the
rangoon befor her arriv thi wa easi to do sinc the steamer
stop at singapor whenc there is a telegraph wire to hong kong
he final resolv moreov befor act more posit to
question passepartout it would not be difficult to make him talk and
as there wa no time to lose fix prepar to make himself known
it wa now the 30th of octob and on the follow dai the rangoon
wa due at singapor
fix emerg from hi cabin and went on deck passepartout wa
promenad up and down in the forward part of the steamer the
detect rush forward with everi appear of extrem surpris and
exclaim you here on the rangoon
what monsieur fix ar you on board return the realli astonish
passepartout recognis hi croni of the mongolia why i left you
at bombai and here you ar on the wai to hong kong ar you go
round the world too
no no repli fix i shall stop at hong kongat least for some
dai
hum said passepartout who seem for an instant perplex but how
is it i have not seen you on board sinc we left calcutta
oh a trifl of seasickness been stai in my berth the gulf
of bengal doe not agre with me as well as the indian ocean and how
is mr fogg
as well and as punctual as ever not a dai behind time but monsieur
fix you dont know that we have a young ladi with us
a young ladi repli the detect not seem to comprehend what
wa said
passepartout thereupon recount aouda histori the affair at the
bombai pagoda the purchas of the eleph for two thousand pound
the rescu the arrest and sentenc of the calcutta court and the
restor of mr fogg and himself to liberti on bail fix who wa
familiar with the last event seem to be equal ignor of all
that passepartout relat and the later wa charm to find so
interest a listen
but doe your master propos to carri thi young woman to europ
not at all we ar simpli go to place her under the protect of
on of her rel a rich merchant at hong kong

disappoint a glass of gin mr passepartout
willingli monsieur fix we must at least have a friendli glass on
board the rangoon
chapter xvii
show what happen on the voyag from singapor to hong kong
the detect and passepartout met often on deck after thi interview
though fix wa reserv and did not attempt to induc hi companion to
divulg ani more fact concern mr fogg he caught a glimps of that
mysteri gentleman onc or twice but mr fogg usual confin
himself to the cabin where he kept aouda compani or accord to hi
inveter habit took a hand at whist
passepartout began veri serious to conjectur what strang chanc
kept fix still on the rout that hi master wa pursu it wa realli
worth consid why thi certainli veri amiabl and complac
person whom he had first met at suez had then encount on board
the mongolia who disembark at bombai which he announc as hi
destin and now turn up so unexpectedli on the rangoon wa
follow mr fogg track step by step what wa fix object
passepartout wa readi to wager hi indian shoeswhich he religi
preservedthat fix would also leav hong kong at the same time with
them and probabl on the same steamer
passepartout might have cudgel hi brain for a centuri without
hit upon the real object which the detect had in view he never
could have imagin that philea fogg wa be track as a robber
around the globe but as it is in human natur to attempt the solut
of everi mysteri passepartout suddenli discov an explan of
fix movement which wa in truth far from unreason fix he
thought could onli be an agent of mr fogg friend at the reform
club sent to follow him up and to ascertain that he realli went round
the world as had been agre upon
it clear repeat the worthi servant to himself proud of hi
shrewd he a spy sent to keep us in view that isnt quit the
thing either to be spy mr fogg who is so honour a man ah
gentlemen of the reform thi shall cost you dear
passepartout enchant with hi discoveri resolv to sai noth to
hi master lest he should be justli offend at thi mistrust on the
part of hi adversari but he determin to chaff fix when he had
the chanc with mysteri allus which howev need not betrai
hi real suspicion
dure the afternoon of wednesdai 30th octob the rangoon enter
the strait of malacca which separ the peninsula of that name from
sumatra the mountain and craggi islet intercept the beauti of
thi nobl island from the view of the travel the rangoon
weigh anchor at singapor the next dai at four am to receiv coal
have gain half a dai on the prescrib time of her arriv philea
fogg note thi gain in hi journal and then accompani by aouda
who betrai a desir for a walk on shore disembark
fix who suspect mr fogg everi movement follow them cautious
without be himself perceiv while passepartout laugh in hi
sleev at fix manuvr went about hi usual errand
the island of singapor is not impos in aspect for there ar no
mountain yet it appear is not without attract it is a park
checker by pleasant highwai and avenu a handsom carriag drawn
by a sleek pair of new holland hors carri philea fogg and aouda
into the midst of row of palm with brilliant foliag and of
clovetre whereof the clove form the heart of a halfopen flower
pepper plant replac the prickli hedg of european field
sagobush larg fern with gorgeou branch vari the aspect of
thi tropic clime while nutmegtre in full foliag fill the air
with a penetr perfum agil and grin band of monkei skip
about in the tree nor were tiger want in the jungl
after a drive of two hour through the countri aouda and mr fogg
return to the town which is a vast collect of heavylook
irregular hous surround by charm garden rich in tropic
fruit and plant and at ten oclock thei reembark close
follow by the detect who had kept them constantli in sight
passepartout who had been purchas sever dozen mangoesa fruit as
larg as goodsiz appl of a darkbrown colour outsid and a bright
red within and whose white pulp melt in the mouth afford
gourmand a delici sensationwa wait for them on deck he wa
onli too glad to offer some mango to aouda who thank him veri
gracefulli for them
at eleven oclock the rangoon rode out of singapor harbour and in a
few hour the high mountain of malacca with their forest inhabit
by the most beautifullyfur tiger in the world were lost to view
singapor is distant some thirteen hundr mile from the island of
hong kong which is a littl english coloni near the chines coast
philea fogg hope to accomplish the journei in six dai so as to be
in time for the steamer which would leav on the 6th of novemb for
yokohama the princip japanes port
the rangoon had a larg quota of passeng mani of whom disembark
at singapor among them a number of indian ceylones chinamen
malai and portugues mostli secondclass travel
the weather which had hitherto been fine chang with the last
quarter of the moon the sea roll heavili and the wind at interv
rose almost to a storm but happili blew from the southwest and thu
aid the steamer progress the captain as often as possibl put up
hi sail and under the doubl action of steam and sail the vessel
made rapid progress along the coast of anam and cochin china ow to
the defect construct of the rangoon howev unusu
precaut becam necessari in unfavour weather but the loss of
time which result from thi caus while it nearli drove passepartout
out of hi sens did not seem to affect hi master in the least
passepartout blame the captain the engin and the crew and
consign all who were connect with the ship to the land where the
pepper grow perhap the thought of the ga which wa remorselessli
burn at hi expens in savil row had someth to do with hi hot
impati
you ar in a great hurri then said fix to him on dai to reach
hong kong
a veri great hurri
mr fogg i suppos is anxiou to catch the steamer for yokohama
terribl anxiou
you believ in thi journei around the world then
absolut dont you mr fix
i i dont believ a word of it
your a sly dog said passepartout wink at him
thi express rather disturb fix without hi know why had the
frenchman guess hi real purpos he knew not what to think but how
could passepartout have discov that he wa a detect yet in
speak as he did the man evid meant more than he express
passepartout went still further the next dai he could not hold hi
tongu
mr fix said he in a banter tone shall we be so unfortun as
to lose you when we get to hong kong
why respond fix a littl embarrass i dont know perhap
ah if you would onli go on with us an agent of the peninsular
compani you know cant stop on the wai you were onli go to
bombai and here you ar in china america is not far off and from
america to europ is onli a step
fix look intent at hi companion whose counten wa as seren
as possibl and laugh with him but passepartout persist in
chaf him by ask him if he made much by hi present occup
ye and no return fix there is good and bad luck in such
thing but you must understand that i dont travel at my own expens
oh i am quit sure of that cri passepartout laugh heartili
fix fairli puzzl descend to hi cabin and gave himself up to hi
reflect he wa evid suspect somehow or other the frenchman
had found out that he wa a detect but had he told hi master what
part wa he plai in all thi wa he an accomplic or not wa the
game then up fix spent sever hour turn these thing over in
hi mind sometim think that all wa lost then persuad himself
that fogg wa ignor of hi presenc and then undecid what cours
it wa best to take
nevertheless he preserv hi cool of mind and at last resolv
to deal plainli with passepartout if he did not find it practic to
arrest fogg at hong kong and if fogg made prepar to leav that
last foothold of english territori he fix would tell passepartout
all either the servant wa the accomplic of hi master and in thi
case the master knew of hi oper and he should fail or els the
servant knew noth about the robberi and then hi interest would be
to abandon the robber
such wa the situat between fix and passepartout meanwhil philea
fogg move about abov them in the most majest and unconsci
indiffer he wa pass method in hi orbit around the
world regardless of the lesser star which gravit around him yet
there wa near by what the astronom would call a disturb star
which might have produc an agit in thi gentleman heart but
no the charm of aouda fail to act to passepartout great
surpris and the disturb if thei exist would have been more
difficult to calcul than those of uranu which led to the discoveri
of neptun
it wa everi dai an increas wonder to passepartout who read in
aouda ey the depth of her gratitud to hi master philea fogg
though brave and gallant must be he thought quit heartless as to
the sentiment which thi journei might have awaken in him there wa
clearli no trace of such a thing while poor passepartout exist in
perpetu reveri
on dai he wa lean on the rail of the engineroom and wa
observ the engin when a sudden pitch of the steamer threw the
screw out of the water the steam came hiss out of the valv and
thi made passepartout indign
the valv ar not suffici charg he exclaim we ar not
go oh these english if thi wa an american craft we should blow
up perhap but we should at all event go faster
chapter xviii
in which philea fogg passepartout and fix go each about hi busi
the weather wa bad dure the latter dai of the voyag the wind
obstin remain in the northwest blew a gale and retard the
steamer the rangoon roll heavili and the passeng becam
impati of the long monstrou wave which the wind rais befor
their path a sort of tempest aros on the 3rd of novemb the squall
knock the vessel about with furi and the wave run high the
rangoon reef all her sail and even the rig prove too much
whistl and shake amid the squall the steamer wa forc to
proce slowli and the captain estim that she would reach hong
kong twenti hour behind time and more if the storm last
philea fogg gaze at the tempestu sea which seem to be
struggl especi to delai him with hi habitu tranquil he
never chang counten for an instant though a delai of twenti
hour by make him too late for the yokohama boat would almost
inevit caus the loss of the wager but thi man of nerv
manifest neither impati nor annoy it seem as if the storm
were a part of hi programm and had been foreseen aouda wa amaz
to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him
fix did not look at the state of thing in the same light the storm
greatli pleas him hi satisfact would have been complet had the
rangoon been forc to retreat befor the violenc of wind and wave
each delai fill him with hope for it becam more and more probabl
that fogg would be oblig to remain some dai at hong kong and now
the heaven themselv becam hi alli with the gust and squall
it matter not that thei made him seasickh made no account of thi
inconveni and whilst hi bodi wa writh under their effect
hi spirit bound with hope exult
passepartout wa enrag beyond express by the unpropiti weather
everyth had gone so well till now earth and sea had seem to be at
hi master servic steamer and railwai obei him wind and steam
unit to speed hi journei had the hour of advers come
passepartout wa as much excit as if the twenti thousand pound were
to come from hi own pocket the storm exasper him the gale made
him furiou and he long to lash the obstin sea into obedi
poor fellow fix carefulli conceal from him hi own satisfact
for had he betrai it passepartout could scarc have restrain
himself from person violenc
passepartout remain on deck as long as the tempest last be
unabl to remain quiet below and take it into hi head to aid the
progress of the ship by lend a hand with the crew he overwhelm
the captain offic and sailor who could not help laugh at hi
impati with all sort of question he want to know exactli how
long the storm wa go to last whereupon he wa refer to the
baromet which seem to have no intent of rise passepartout
shook it but with no percept effect for neither shake nor
maledict could prevail upon it to chang it mind
on the 4th howev the sea becam more calm and the storm lessen
it violenc the wind veer southward and wa onc more favour
passepartout clear up with the weather some of the sail were
unfurl and the rangoon resum it most rapid speed the time lost
could not howev be regain land wa not signal until five
oclock on the morn of the 6th the steamer wa due on the 5th
philea fogg wa twentyfour hour behindhand and the yokohama
steamer would of cours be miss
the pilot went on board at six and took hi place on the bridg to
guid the rangoon through the channel to the port of hong kong
passepartout long to ask him if the steamer had left for yokohama
but he dare not for he wish to preserv the spark of hope which
still remain till the last moment he had confid hi anxieti to fix
whoth sly rascaltri to consol him by sai that mr fogg would
be in time if he took the next boat but thi onli put passepartout in
a passion
mr fogg bolder than hi servant did not hesit to approach the
pilot and tranquilli ask him if he knew when a steamer would leav
hong kong for yokohama
at high tide tomorrow morn answer the pilot
ah said mr fogg without betrai ani astonish
passepartout who heard what pass would willingli have embrac the

oblig to await for a week the sail of the next steamer mr fogg
wa it is true twentyfour hour behind hi time but thi could not
serious imperil the remaind of hi tour
the steamer which cross the pacif from yokohama to san francisco
made a direct connect with that from hong kong and it could not
sail until the latter reach yokohama and if mr fogg wa twentyfour
hour late on reach yokohama thi time would no doubt be easili
regain in the voyag of twentytwo dai across the pacif he found

had he been capabl of be astonish at anyth it would have been
not to see hi servant return at bedtim but know that the steamer

disturb himself about the matter when passepartout did not appear the
next morn to answer hi master bell mr fogg not betrai the

it wa then eight oclock at halfpast nine it be then high tide
the carnat would leav the harbour mr fogg and aouda got into the

there ar other vessel besid the carnat it seem to me in the

and offer hi arm to aouda he direct hi step toward the dock
in search of some craft about to start fix stupefi follow it
seem as if he were attach to mr fogg by an invis thread
chanc howev appear realli to have abandon the man it had
hitherto serv so well for three hour philea fogg wander about
the dock with the determin if necessari to charter a vessel to
carri him to yokohama but he could onli find vessel which were
load or unload and which could not therefor set sail fix began
to hope again
but mr fogg far from be discourag wa continu hi search
resolv not to stop if he had to resort to macao when he wa accost
by a sailor on on of the wharv
is your honour look for a boat
have you a boat readi to sail

the sailor lean on the rail open hi ey wide and said is
your honour joke

14th at the latest to take the boat for san francisco
i am sorri said the sailor but it is imposs
i offer you a hundr pound per dai and an addit reward of two
hundr pound if i reach yokohama in time
ar you in earnest
veri much so
the pilot walk awai a littl distanc and gaze out to sea

fear of ventur so far fix wa in mortal suspens
mr fogg turn to aouda and ask her you would not be afraid would
you madam

the pilot now return shuffl hi hat in hi hand
well pilot said mr fogg
well your honour repli he i could not risk myself my men or
my littl boat of scarc twenti ton on so long a voyag at thi time
of year besid we could not reach yokohama in time for it is
sixteen hundr and sixti mile from hong kong
onli sixteen hundr said mr fogg
it the same thing
fix breath more freeli
but ad the pilot it might be arrang anoth wai
fix ceas to breath at all
how ask mr fogg
by go to nagasaki at the extrem south of japan or even to
shanghai which is onli eight hundr mile from here in go to
shanghai we should not be forc to sail wide of the chines coast
which would be a great advantag as the current run northward and
would aid us
pilot said mr fogg i must take the american steamer at yokohama
and not at shanghai or nagasaki
why not return the pilot the san francisco steamer doe not
start from yokohama it put in at yokohama and nagasaki but it start
from shanghai
you ar sure of that
perfectli
and when doe the boat leav shanghai
on the 11th at seven in the even we have therefor four dai
befor us that is ninetysix hour and in that time if we had good
luck and a southwest wind and the sea wa calm we could make those
eight hundr mile to shanghai
and you could go
in an hour as soon as provis could be got aboard and the sail
put up
it is a bargain ar you the master of the boat
ye john bunsbi master of the tankader
would you like some earnestmonei
if it would not put your honour out
here ar two hundr pound on account sir ad philea fogg
turn to fix if you would like to take advantag
thank sir i wa about to ask the favour
veri well in half an hour we shall go on board
but poor passepartout urg aouda who wa much disturb by the
servant disappear
i shall do all i can to find him repli philea fogg
while fix in a feverish nervou state repair to the pilotboat
the other direct their cours to the policest at hong kong
philea fogg there gave passepartout descript and left a sum of
monei to be spent in the search for him the same formal have
been gone through at the french consul and the palanquin have
stop at the hotel for the luggag which had been sent back there
thei return to the wharf
it wa now three oclock and pilotboat no 43 with it crew on
board and it provis store awai wa readi for departur
the tankader wa a neat littl craft of twenti ton as gracefulli
built as if she were a race yacht her shine copper sheath her
galvanis ironwork her deck white as ivori betrai the pride
taken by john bunsbi in make her present her two mast lean a
trifl backward she carri brigantin foresail stormjib and
standingjib and wa well rig for run befor the wind and she
seem capabl of brisk speed which inde she had alreadi prove by
gain sever prize in pilotboat race the crew of the tankader
wa compos of john bunsbi the master and four hardi marin who
were familiar with the chines sea john bunsbi himself a man of
fortyf or thereabout vigor sunburnt with a sprightli
express of the ey and energet and selfreli counten
would have inspir confid in the most timid
philea fogg and aouda went on board where thei found fix alreadi
instal below deck wa a squar cabin of which the wall bulg out
in the form of cot abov a circular divan in the centr wa a tabl
provid with a swing lamp the accommod wa confin but
neat
i am sorri to have noth better to offer you said mr fogg to fix
who bow without respond
the detect had a feel akin to humili in profit by the
kind of mr fogg
it certain thought he though rascal as he is he is a polit
on
the sail and the english flag were hoist at ten minut past three
mr fogg and aouda who were seat on deck cast a last glanc at the
quai in the hope of espi passepartout fix wa not without hi
fear lest chanc should direct the step of the unfortun servant
whom he had so badli treat in thi direct in which case an
explan the revers of satisfactori to the detect must have
ensu but the frenchman did not appear and without doubt wa still
ly under the stupefi influenc of the opium
john bunsbi master at length gave the order to start and the
tankader take the wind under her brigantin foresail and
standingjib bound briskli forward over the wave
chapter xxi
in which the master of the tankader run great risk of lose a
reward of two hundr pound
thi voyag of eight hundr mile wa a peril ventur on a craft of
twenti ton and at that season of the year the chines sea ar
usual boister subject to terribl gale of wind and especi
dure the equinox and it wa now earli novemb
it would clearli have been to the master advantag to carri hi
passeng to yokohama sinc he wa paid a certain sum per dai but he
would have been rash to attempt such a voyag and it wa imprud
even to attempt to reach shanghai but john bunsbi believ in the
tankader which rode on the wave like a seagul and perhap he wa
not wrong
late in the dai thei pass through the caprici channel of hong
kong and the tankader impel by favour wind conduct
herself admir
i do not need pilot said philea fogg when thei got into the open
sea to advis you to us all possibl speed
trust me your honour we ar carri all the sail the wind will let
us the pole would add noth and ar onli us when we ar go
into port
it your trade not mine pilot and i confid in you
philea fogg with bodi erect and leg wide apart stand like a
sailor gaze without stagger at the swell water the young
woman who wa seat aft wa profoundli affect as she look out
upon the ocean darken now with the twilight on which she had
ventur in so frail a vessel abov her head rustl the white sail
which seem like great white wing the boat carri forward by the
wind seem to be fly in the air
night came the moon wa enter her first quarter and her
insuffici light would soon die out in the mist on the horizon
cloud were rise from the east and alreadi overcast a part of the
heaven
the pilot had hung out hi light which wa veri necessari in these
sea crowd with vessel bound landward for collis ar not
uncommon occurr and at the speed she wa go the least shock
would shatter the gallant littl craft
fix seat in the bow gave himself up to medit he kept apart
from hi fellowtravel know mr fogg taciturn tast
besid he did not quit like to talk to the man whose favour he had
accept he wa think too of the futur it seem certain that
fogg would not stop at yokohama but would at onc take the boat for
san francisco and the vast extent of america would ensur him impun
and safeti fogg plan appear to him the simplest in the world
instead of sail directli from england to the unit state like a
common villain he had travers three quarter of the globe so as to
gain the american contin more sure and there after throw the
polic off hi track he would quietli enjoi himself with the fortun
stolen from the bank but onc in the unit state what should he
fix do should he abandon thi man no a hundr time no until he
had secur hi extradit he would not lose sight of him for an
hour it wa hi duti and he would fulfil it to the end at all
event there wa on thing to be thank for passepartout wa not
with hi master and it wa abov all import after the confid
fix had impart to him that the servant should never have speech with
hi master
philea fogg wa also think of passepartout who had so strang
disappear look at the matter from everi point of view it did not
seem to him imposs that by some mistak the man might have
embark on the carnat at the last moment and thi wa also
aouda opinion who regret veri much the loss of the worthi fellow
to whom she ow so much thei might then find him at yokohama for if
the carnat wa carri him thither it would be easi to ascertain
if he had been on board
a brisk breez aros about ten oclock but though it might have been
prudent to take in a reef the pilot after carefulli examin the
heaven let the craft remain rig as befor the tankader bore
sail admir as she drew a great deal of water and everyth wa
prepar for high speed in case of a gale
mr fogg and aouda descend into the cabin at midnight have been
alreadi preced by fix who had lain down on on of the cot the
pilot and crew remain on deck all night
at sunris the next dai which wa 8th novemb the boat had made more
than on hundr mile the log indic a mean speed of between eight
and nine mile the tankader still carri all sail and wa
accomplish her greatest capac of speed if the wind held as it
wa the chanc would be in her favour dure the dai she kept along
the coast where the current were favour the coast irregular in
profil and visibl sometim across the clear wa at most five
mile distant the sea wa less boister sinc the wind came off
landa fortun circumst for the boat which would suffer ow
to it small tonnag by a heavi surg on the sea
the breez subsid a littl toward noon and set in from the
southwest the pilot put up hi pole but took them down again within
two hour as the wind freshen up anew
mr fogg and aouda happili unaffect by the rough of the sea at
with a good appetit fix be invit to share their repast which he
accept with secret chagrin to travel at thi man expens and live
upon hi provis wa not palat to him still he wa oblig to
eat and so he at
when the meal wa over he took mr fogg apart and said sirthi
sir scorch hi lip and he had to control himself to avoid
collar thi gentlemansir you have been veri kind to give me a
passag on thi boat but though my mean will not admit of my
expend them as freeli as you i must ask to pai my share
let us not speak of that sir repli mr fogg
but if i insist
no sir repeat mr fogg in a tone which did not admit of a repli
thi enter into my gener expens
fix as he bow had a stifl feel and go forward where he
ensconc himself did not open hi mouth for the rest of the dai
meanwhil thei were progress famous and john bunsbi wa in high
hope he sever time assur mr fogg that thei would reach shanghai
in time to which that gentleman respond that he count upon it the
crew set to work in good earnest inspir by the reward to be gain
there wa not a sheet which wa not tighten not a sail which wa not
vigor hoist not a lurch could be charg to the man at the
helm thei work as desper as if thei were contest in a royal
yacht regatta
by even the log show that two hundr and twenti mile had been
accomplish from hong kong and mr fogg might hope that he would be
abl to reach yokohama without record ani delai in hi journal in
which case the mani misadventur which had overtaken him sinc he
left london would not serious affect hi journei
the tankader enter the strait of fokien which separ the
island of formosa from the chines coast in the small hour of the
night and cross the tropic of cancer the sea wa veri rough in the
strait full of eddi form by the countercurr and the
chop wave broke her cours whilst it becam veri difficult to
stand on deck
at daybreak the wind began to blow hard again and the heaven seem
to predict a gale the baromet announc a speedi chang the mercuri
rise and fall caprici the sea also in the southeast
rais long surg which indic a tempest the sun had set the
even befor in a red mist in the midst of the phosphoresc
scintil of the ocean
john bunsbi long examin the threaten aspect of the heaven
mutter indistinctli between hi teeth at last he said in a low
voic to mr fogg shall i speak out to your honour
of cours
well we ar go to have a squall
is the wind north or south ask mr fogg quietli
south look a typhoon is come up
glad it a typhoon from the south for it will carri us forward
oh if you take it that wai said john bunsbi iv noth more to
sai john bunsbi suspicion were confirm at a less advanc
season of the year the typhoon accord to a famou meteorologist
would have pass awai like a lumin cascad of electr flame but
in the winter equinox it wa to be fear that it would burst upon them
with great violenc
the pilot took hi precaut in advanc he reef all sail the
polemast were dispens with all hand went forward to the bow a
singl triangular sail of strong canva wa hoist as a stormjib
so as to hold the wind from behind then thei wait
john bunsbi had request hi passeng to go below but thi
imprison in so narrow a space with littl air and the boat
bounc in the gale wa far from pleasant neither mr fogg fix nor
aouda consent to leav the deck
the storm of rain and wind descend upon them toward eight oclock
with but it bit of sail the tankader wa lift like a feather by
a wind an idea of whose violenc can scarc be given to compar her
speed to four time that of a locomot go on full steam would be
below the truth
the boat scud thu northward dure the whole dai born on by
monstrou wave preserv alwai fortun a speed equal to
their twenti time she seem almost to be submerg by these
mountain of water which rose behind her but the adroit manag of
the pilot save her the passeng were often bath in sprai but
thei submit to it philosoph fix curs it no doubt but
aouda with her ey fasten upon her protector whose cool amaz
her show herself worthi of him and brave weather the storm as
for philea fogg it seem just as if the typhoon were a part of hi
programm
up to thi time the tankader had alwai held her cours to the
north but toward even the wind veer three quarter bore down
from the northwest the boat now ly in the trough of the wave
shook and roll terribl the sea struck her with fear violenc at
night the tempest increas in violenc john bunsbi saw the approach
of dark and the rise of the storm with dark misgiv he
thought awhil and then ask hi crew if it wa not time to slacken
speed after a consult he approach mr fogg and said i think
your honour that we should do well to make for on of the port on the
coast
i think so too
ah said the pilot but which on
i know of but on return mr fogg tranquilli
and that is
shanghai
the pilot at first did not seem to comprehend he could scarc
realis so much determin and tenac then he cri welly
your honour is right to shanghai
so the tankader kept steadili on her northward track
the night wa realli terribl it would be a miracl if the craft did
not founder twice it could have been all over with her if the crew had
not been constantli on the watch aouda wa exhaust but did not
utter a complaint more than onc mr fogg rush to protect her from
the violenc of the wave
dai reappear the tempest still rage with undiminish furi but the
wind now return to the southeast it wa a favour chang and
the tankader again bound forward on thi mountain sea though
the wave cross each other and impart shock and countershock
which would have crush a craft less solidli built from time to time
the coast wa visibl through the broken mist but no vessel wa in
sight the tankader wa alon upon the sea
there were some sign of a calm at noon and these becam more distinct
as the sun descend toward the horizon the tempest had been as brief
as terrif the passeng thoroughli exhaust could now eat a
littl and take some repos
the night wa compar quiet some of the sail were again
hoist and the speed of the boat wa veri good the next morn at
dawn thei espi the coast and john bunsbi wa abl to assert that
thei were not on hundr mile from shanghai a hundr mile and
onli on dai to travers them that veri even mr fogg wa due at
shanghai if he did not wish to miss the steamer to yokohama had there
been no storm dure which sever hour were lost thei would be at
thi moment within thirti mile of their destin
the wind grew decidedli calmer and happili the sea fell with it all
sail were now hoist and at noon the tankader wa within
fortyf mile of shanghai there remain yet six hour in which to
accomplish that distanc all on board fear that it could not be
done and everi onephilea fogg no doubt exceptedfelt hi heart
beat with impati the boat must keep up an averag of nine mile an
hour and the wind wa becom calmer everi moment it wa a
caprici breez come from the coast and after it pass the sea
becam smooth still the tankader wa so light and her fine sail
caught the fickl zephyr so well that with the aid of the current
john bunsbi found himself at six oclock not more than ten mile from
the mouth of shanghai river shanghai itself is situat at least
twelv mile up the stream at seven thei were still three mile from
shanghai the pilot swore an angri oath the reward of two hundr
pound wa evid on the point of escap him he look at mr
fogg mr fogg wa perfectli tranquil and yet hi whole fortun wa at
thi moment at stake
at thi moment also a long black funnel crown with wreath of
smoke appear on the edg of the water it wa the american steamer
leav for yokohama at the appoint time
confound her cri john bunsbi push back the rudder with a
desper jerk
signal her said philea fogg quietli
a small brass cannon stood on the forward deck of the tankader for
make signal in the fog it wa load to the muzzl but just as
the pilot wa about to appli a redhot coal to the touchhol mr fogg
said hoist your flag
the flag wa run up at halfmast and thi be the signal of
distress it wa hope that the american steamer perceiv it would
chang her cours a littl so as to succour the pilotboat
fire said mr fogg and the boom of the littl cannon resound
in the air
chapter xxii
in which passepartout find out that even at the antipod it is
conveni to have some monei in on pocket
the carnat set sail from hong kong at halfpast six on the 7th
of novemb direct her cours at full steam toward japan she
carri a larg cargo and a wellfil cabin of passeng two
stateroom in the rear were howev unoccupiedthos which had been
engag by philea fogg
the next dai a passeng with a halfstupefi ey stagger gait
and disord hair wa seen to emerg from the second cabin and to
totter to a seat on deck
it wa passepartout and what had happen to him wa as follow
shortli after fix left the opium den two waiter had lift the
unconsci passepartout and had carri him to the bed reserv for
the smoker three hour later pursu even in hi dream by a fix
idea the poor fellow awok and struggl against the stupefi
influenc of the narcot the thought of a duti unfulfil shook off
hi torpor and he hurri from the abod of drunken stagger
and hold himself up by keep against the wall fall down and
creep up again and irresist impel by a kind of instinct he
kept cry out the carnat the carnat
the steamer lai puf alongsid the quai on the point of start
passepartout had but few step to go and rush upon the plank he
cross it and fell unconsci on the deck just as the carnat
wa move off sever sailor who were evid accustom to thi
sort of scene carri the poor frenchman down into the second cabin
and passepartout did not wake until thei were on hundr and fifti
mile awai from china thu he found himself the next morn on the
deck of the carnat and eagerli inhal the exhilar
seabreez the pure air sober him he began to collect hi sens
which he found a difficult task but at last he recal the event of
the even befor fix revel and the opiumhous
it is evid said he to himself that i have been abomin
drunk what will mr fogg sai at least i have not miss the steamer
which is the most import thing
then as fix occur to him as for that rascal i hope we ar well
rid of him and that he ha not dare as he propos to follow us on
board the carnat a detect on the track of mr fogg accus of
rob the bank of england pshaw mr fogg is no more a robber than i
am a murder
should he divulg fix real errand to hi master would it do to tell
the part the detect wa plai would it not be better to wait
until mr fogg reach london again and then impart to him that an
agent of the metropolitan polic had been follow him round the
world and have a good laugh over it no doubt at least it wa worth
consid the first thing to do wa to find mr fogg and apologis
for hi singular behaviour
passepartout got up and proceed as well as he could with the roll
of the steamer to the afterdeck he saw no on who resembl either
hi master or aouda good mutter he aouda ha not got up yet
and mr fogg ha probabl found some partner at whist
he descend to the saloon mr fogg wa not there passepartout had
onli howev to ask the purser the number of hi master stateroom
the purser repli that he did not know ani passeng by the name of
fogg
i beg your pardon said passepartout persist he is a tall
gentleman quiet and not veri talk and ha with him a young
ladi
there is no young ladi on board interrupt the purser here is a
list of the passeng you mai see for yourself
passepartout scan the list but hi master name wa not upon it
all at onc an idea struck him
ah am i on the carnat
ye
on the wai to yokohama
certainli
passepartout had for an instant fear that he wa on the wrong boat
but though he wa realli on the carnat hi master wa not there
he fell thunderstruck on a seat he saw it all now he rememb that
the time of sail had been chang that he should have inform hi
master of that fact and that he had not done so it wa hi fault
then that mr fogg and aouda had miss the steamer ye but it wa
still more the fault of the traitor who in order to separ him from
hi master and detain the latter at hong kong had inveigl him into
get drunk he now saw the detect trick and at thi moment mr
fogg wa certainli ruin hi bet wa lost and he himself perhap
arrest and imprison at thi thought passepartout tore hi hair
ah if fix ever came within hi reach what a settl of account
there would be
after hi first depress passepartout becam calmer and began to
studi hi situat it wa certainli not an enviabl on he found
himself on the wai to japan and what should he do when he got there
hi pocket wa empti he had not a solitari shill not so much as a
penni hi passag had fortun been paid for in advanc and he had
five or six dai in which to decid upon hi futur cours he fell to
at meal with an appetit and at for mr fogg aouda and himself he
help himself as gener as if japan were a desert where noth
to eat wa to be look for
at dawn on the 13th the carnat enter the port of yokohama thi

the next morn poor jade famish passepartout said to himself
that he must get someth to eat at all hazard and the sooner he did
so the better he might inde sell hi watch but he would have

the audienc prematur arous from their slumber might not
possibl pai their entertain with coin bear the mikado featur
passepartout therefor decid to wait sever hour and as he wa
saunter along it occur to him that he would seem rather too well
dress for a wander artist the idea struck him to chang hi
garment for cloth more in harmoni with hi project by which he
might also get a littl monei to satisfi the immedi crave of

which at first had seem so simpl began to grow more and more
formid to hi mind what need would thei have of a cook or servant
on an american steamer and what confid would thei put in him

she often chat with passepartout who did not fail to perceiv the
state of the ladi heart and be the most faith of domest
he never exhaust hi eulogi of philea fogg honesti generos
and devot he took pain to calm aouda doubt of a success
termin of the journei tell her that the most difficult part of

japan and china and were fairli on their wai to civilis place
again a railwai train from san francisco to new york and a
transatlant steamer from new york to liverpool would doubtless bring
them to the end of thi imposs journei round the world within the

exhaust fiftytwo of the eighti dai in which he wa to complet the

halfwai by the differ of meridian he had realli gone over
twothird of the whole journei for he had been oblig to make long
circuit from london to aden from aden to bombai from calcutta to
singapor and from singapor to yokohama could he have follow
without deviat the fiftieth parallel which is that of london the
whole distanc would onli have been about twelv thousand mile
wherea he would be forc by the irregular method of locomot to
travers twentysix thousand of which he had on the 23rd of novemb
accomplish seventeen thousand five hundr and now the cours wa a

meridian the sun and the moon moon inde moonshin more like
if on listen to that sort of peopl a pretti sort of time on would
keep i wa sure that the sun would some dai regul itself by my
watch
passepartout wa ignor that if the face of hi watch had been
divid into twentyfour hour like the italian clock he would have
no reason for exult for the hand of hi watch would then
instead of as now indic nine oclock in the morn indic nine
oclock in the even that is the twentyfirst hour after midnight
precis the differ between london time and that of the on
hundr and eightieth meridian but if fix had been abl to explain
thi pure physic effect passepartout would not have admit even
if he had comprehend it moreov if the detect had been on board
at that moment passepartout would have join issu with him on a
quit differ subject and in an entir differ manner
where wa fix at that moment

in which colonel proctor with hi insol manner wa conspicu
passepartout join the group heard the signalman sai no you
cant pass the bridg at medicin bow is shaki and would not bear the
weight of the train
thi wa a suspensionbridg thrown over some rapid about a mile from
the place where thei now were accord to the signalman it wa in a
ruinou condit sever of the iron wire be broken and it wa
imposs to risk the passag he did not in ani wai exagger the
condit of the bridg it mai be taken for grant that rash as the
american usual ar when thei ar prudent there is good reason for
it
passepartout not dare to appris hi master of what he heard
listen with set teeth immov as a statu
hum cri colonel proctor but we ar not go to stai here i
imagin and take root in the snow
colonel repli the conductor we have telegraph to omaha for a
train but it is not like that it will reach medicin bow in less
than six hour
six hour cri passepartout
certainli return the conductor besid it will take us as long
as that to reach medicin bow on foot
but it is onli a mile from here said on of the passeng
ye but it on the other side of the river
and cant we cross that in a boat ask the colonel
that imposs the creek is swell by the rain it is a rapid
and we shall have to make a circuit of ten mile to the north to find a
ford
the colonel launch a vollei of oath denounc the railwai compani
and the conductor and passepartout who wa furiou wa not
disinclin to make common caus with him here wa an obstacl
inde which all hi master banknot could not remov
there wa a gener disappoint among the passeng who without
reckon the delai saw themselv compel to trudg fifteen mile
over a plain cover with snow thei grumbl and protest and would
certainli have thu attract philea fogg attent if he had not
been complet absorb in hi game
passepartout found that he could not avoid tell hi master what had
occur and with hang head he wa turn toward the car when
the engin a true yanke name forster call out gentlemen
perhap there is a wai after all to get over
on the bridg ask a passeng
on the bridg
with our train
with our train
passepartout stop short and eagerli listen to the engin
but the bridg is unsaf urg the conductor
no matter repli forster i think that by put on the veri
highest speed we might have a chanc of get over
the devil mutter passepartout
but a number of the passeng were at onc attract by the engin
propos and colonel proctor wa especi delight and found the
plan a veri feasibl on he told stori about engin leap their
train over river without bridg by put on full steam and mani
of those present avow themselv of the engin mind
we have fifti chanc out of a hundr of get over said on
eighti nineti
passepartout wa astound and though readi to attempt anyth to
get over medicin creek thought the experi propos a littl too
american besid thought he there a still more simpl wai and
it doe not even occur to ani of these peopl sir said he aloud to
on of the passeng the engin plan seem to me a littl
danger but
eighti chanc repli the passeng turn hi back on him
i know it said passepartout turn to anoth passeng but a
simpl idea
idea ar no us return the american shrug hi shoulder as
the engin assur us that we can pass
doubtless urg passepartout we can pass but perhap it would be
more prudent
what prudent cri colonel proctor whom thi word seem to excit
prodigi at full speed dont you see at full speed
i knowi see repeat passepartout but it would be if not more
prudent sinc that word displeas you at least more natur
who what what the matter with thi fellow cri sever
the poor fellow did not know to whom to address himself
ar you afraid ask colonel proctor
i afraid veri well i will show these peopl that a frenchman can be
as american as thei
all aboard cri the conductor
ye all aboard repeat passepartout and immedi but thei
cant prevent me from think that it would be more natur for us to
cross the bridg on foot and let the train come after
but no on heard thi sage reflect nor would anyon have
acknowledg it justic the passeng resum their place in the
car passepartout took hi seat without tell what had pass the
whistplay were quit absorb in their game
the locomot whistl vigor the engin revers the steam
back the train for nearli a mileretir like a jumper in order to
take a longer leap then with anoth whistl he began to move
forward the train increas it speed and soon it rapid becam
fright a prolong screech issu from the locomot the piston
work up and down twenti stroke to the second thei perceiv that
the whole train rush on at the rate of a hundr mile an hour
hardli bore upon the rail at all
and thei pass over it wa like a flash no on saw the bridg the
train leap so to speak from on bank to the other and the engin
could not stop it until it had gone five mile beyond the station but
scarc had the train pass the river when the bridg complet
ruin fell with a crash into the rapid of medicin bow

toward two oclock in the afternoon while it wa snow hard long
whistl were heard approach from the east a great shadow preced

the engin nor the stoker wa dead and after remain for some
time in their swoon had come to themselv the train had then
stop the engin when he found himself in the desert and the
locomot without car understood what had happen he could not
imagin how the locomot had becom separ from the train but he
did not doubt that the train left behind wa in distress
he did not hesit what to do it would be prudent to continu on to
omaha for it would be danger to return to the train which the
indian might still be engag in pillag nevertheless he began to
rebuild the fire in the furnac the pressur again mount and the
locomot return run backward to fort kearnei thi it wa
which wa whistl in the mist
the travel were glad to see the locomot resum it place at the

and he had onli to take hi seat in the car an irresist influenc
held him back the station platform burn hi feet and he could not

snow as if to pierc the mist which narrow the horizon around her
and to hear if possibl some welcom sound she heard and saw
noth then she would return chill through to issu out again
after the laps of a few moment but alwai in vain
even came and the littl band had not return where could thei
be had thei found the indian and were thei have a conflict with

shake hi head
thu the night pass at dawn the halfextinguish disc of the sun
rose abov a misti horizon but it wa now possibl to recognis
object two mile off philea fogg and the squad had gone southward
in the south all wa still vacanc it wa then seven oclock
the captain who wa realli alarm did not know what cours to take

mr fogg wa march at their head and just behind him were
passepartout and the other two travel rescu from the sioux
thei had met and fought the indian ten mile south of fort kearnei
shortli befor the detach arriv passepartout and hi companion
had begun to struggl with their captor three of whom the frenchman
had fell with hi fist when hi master and the soldier hasten up

all were welcom with joy cri philea fogg distribut the
reward he had promis to the soldier while passepartout not without
reason mutter to himself it must certainli be confess that i
cost my master dear
fix without sai a word look at mr fogg and it would have been
difficult to analys the thought which struggl within him as for
aouda she took her protector hand and press it in her own too
much move to speak
meanwhil passepartout wa look about for the train he thought he
should find it there readi to start for omaha and he hope that the
time lost might be regain

and when doe the next train pass here said philea fogg
not till thi even
ah return the impass gentleman quietli
chapter xxxi
in which fix the detect consider further the interest of
philea fogg
philea fogg found himself twenti hour behind time passepartout the
involuntari caus of thi delai wa desper he had ruin hi
master
at thi moment the detect approach mr fogg and look him
intent in the face said
serious sir ar you in great hast
quit serious
i have a purpos in ask resum fix is it absolut necessari
that you should be in new york on the 11th befor nine oclock in the
even the time that the steamer leav for liverpool
it is absolut necessari
and if your journei had not been interrupt by these indian you
would have reach new york on the morn of the 11th
ye with eleven hour to spare befor the steamer left
good you ar therefor twenti hour behind twelv from twenti leav
eight you must regain eight hour do you wish to try to do so
on foot ask mr fogg
no on a sledg repli fix on a sledg with sail a man ha
propos such a method to me
it wa the man who had spoken to fix dure the night and whose offer
he had refus
philea fogg did not repli at onc but fix have point out the
man who wa walk up and down in front of the station mr fogg went
up to him an instant after mr fogg and the american whose name wa
mudg enter a hut built just below the fort
there mr fogg examin a curiou vehicl a kind of frame on two long
beam a littl rais in front like the runner of a sledg and upon
which there wa room for five or six person a high mast wa fix on
the frame held firmli by metal lash to which wa attach a
larg brigantin sail thi mast held an iron stai upon which to hoist
a jibsail behind a sort of rudder serv to guid the vehicl it
wa in short a sledg rig like a sloop dure the winter when
the train ar block up by the snow these sledg make extrem
rapid journei across the frozen plain from on station to anoth
provid with more sail than a cutter and with the wind behind them
thei slip over the surfac of the prairi with a speed equal if not
superior to that of the express train
mr fogg readili made a bargain with the owner of thi landcraft the
wind wa favour be fresh and blow from the west the snow
had harden and mudg wa veri confid of be abl to transport
mr fogg in a few hour to omaha thenc the train eastward run
frequent to chicago and new york it wa not imposs that the lost
time might yet be recov and such an opportun wa not to be
reject
not wish to expos aouda to the discomfort of travel in the
open air mr fogg propos to leav her with passepartout at fort
kearnei the servant take upon himself to escort her to europ by a
better rout and under more favour condit but aouda refus to
separ from mr fogg and passepartout wa delight with her
decis for noth could induc him to leav hi master while fix
wa with him
it would be difficult to guess the detect thought wa thi
convict shaken by philea fogg return or did he still regard him
as an exceedingli shrewd rascal who hi journei round the world
complet would think himself absolut safe in england perhap
fix opinion of philea fogg wa somewhat modifi but he wa
nevertheless resolv to do hi duti and to hasten the return of the
whole parti to england as much as possibl
at eight oclock the sledg wa readi to start the passeng took
their place on it and wrap themselv up close in their
travellingcloak the two great sail were hoist and under the
pressur of the wind the sledg slid over the harden snow with a
veloc of forti mile an hour
the distanc between fort kearnei and omaha as the bird fly is at
most two hundr mile if the wind held good the distanc might be
travers in five hour if no accid happen the sledg might reach
omaha by on oclock
what a journei the travel huddl close togeth could not speak
for the cold intensifi by the rapid at which thei were go the
sledg sped on as lightli as a boat over the wave when the breez
came skim the earth the sledg seem to be lift off the ground
by it sail mudg who wa at the rudder kept in a straight line
and by a turn of hi hand check the lurch which the vehicl had a
tendenc to make all the sail were up and the jib wa so arrang as
not to screen the brigantin a topmast wa hoist and anoth jib
held out to the wind ad it forc to the other sail although the
speed could not be exactli estim the sledg could not be go at
less than forti mile an hour
if noth break said mudg we shall get there
mr fogg had made it for mudg interest to reach omaha within the
time agre on by the offer of a handsom reward
the prairi across which the sledg wa move in a straight line wa
as flat as a sea it seem like a vast frozen lake the railroad which
ran through thi section ascend from the southwest to the northwest
by great island columbu an import nebraska town schuyler and
fremont to omaha it follow throughout the right bank of the platt
river the sledg shorten thi rout took a chord of the arc
describ by the railwai mudg wa not afraid of be stop by the
platt river becaus it wa frozen the road then wa quit clear of
obstacl and philea fogg had but two thing to fearan accid to
the sledg and a chang or calm in the wind
but the breez far from lessen it forc blew as if to bend the
mast which howev the metal lash held firmli these
lash like the chord of a string instrument resound as if
vibrat by a violin bow the sledg slid along in the midst of a
plaintiv intens melodi
those chord give the fifth and the octav said mr fogg
these were the onli word he utter dure the journei aouda cosili
pack in fur and cloak wa shelter as much as possibl from the
attack of the freez wind as for passepartout hi face wa as red
as the sun disc when it set in the mist and he labori inhal
the bite air with hi natur buoyanc of spirit he began to hope
again thei would reach new york on the even if not on the morn
of the 11th and there were still some chanc that it would be befor
the steamer sail for liverpool
passepartout even felt a strong desir to grasp hi alli fix by the
hand he rememb that it wa the detect who procur the sledg
the onli mean of reach omaha in time but check by some
presenti he kept hi usual reserv on thing howev
passepartout would never forget and that wa the sacrific which mr
fogg had made without hesit to rescu him from the sioux mr
fogg had risk hi fortun and hi life no hi servant would never
forget that
while each of the parti wa absorb in reflect so differ the
sledg flew past over the vast carpet of snow the creek it pass
over were not perceiv field and stream disappear under the
uniform white the plain wa absolut desert between the union
pacif road and the branch which unit kearnei with saint joseph it
form a great uninhabit island neither villag station nor fort
appear from time to time thei sped by some phantomlik tree whose
white skeleton twist and rattl in the wind sometim flock of
wild bird rose or band of gaunt famish feroci prairiewolv
ran howl after the sledg passepartout revolv in hand held
himself readi to fire on those which came too near had an accid
then happen to the sledg the travel attack by these beast
would have been in the most terribl danger but it held on it even
cours soon gain on the wolv and er long left the howl band
at a safe distanc behind
about noon mudg perceiv by certain landmark that he wa cross
the platt river he said noth but he felt certain that he wa now
within twenti mile of omaha in less than an hour he left the rudder
and furl hi sail whilst the sledg carri forward by the great
impetu the wind had given it went on half a mile further with it
sail unspread
it stop at last and mudg point to a mass of roof white with
snow said we have got there

in which philea fogg engag in a direct struggl with bad fortun
the china in leav seem to have carri off philea fogg last
hope none of the other steamer were abl to serv hi project the
pereir of the french transatlant compani whose admir
steamer ar equal to ani in speed and comfort did not leav until the
14th the hamburg boat did not go directli to liverpool or london but
to havr and the addit trip from havr to southampton would
render philea fogg last effort of no avail the inman steamer did
not depart till the next dai and could not cross the atlant in time
to save the wager
mr fogg learn all thi in consult hi bradshaw which gave him
the daili movement of the transatlant steamer
passepartout wa crush it overwhelm him to lose the boat by
threequart of an hour it wa hi fault for instead of help
hi master he had not ceas put obstacl in hi path and when
he recal all the incid of the tour when he count up the sum
expend in pure loss and on hi own account when he thought that the
immens stake ad to the heavi charg of thi useless journei
would complet ruin mr fogg he overwhelm himself with bitter
selfaccus mr fogg howev did not reproach him and on
leav the cunard pier onli said we will consult about what is best
tomorrow come
the parti cross the hudson in the jersei citi ferryboat and drove in
a carriag to the st nichola hotel on broadwai room were engag
and the night pass briefli to philea fogg who slept profoundli
but veri long to aouda and the other whose agit did not permit
them to rest
the next dai wa the 12th of decemb from seven in the morn of the
12th to a quarter befor nine in the even of the 21st there were
nine dai thirteen hour and fortyf minut if philea fogg had
left in the china on of the fastest steamer on the atlant he
would have reach liverpool and then london within the period agre
upon
mr fogg left the hotel alon after give passepartout instruct
to await hi return and inform aouda to be readi at an instant
notic he proceed to the bank of the hudson and look about among
the vessel moor or anchor in the river for ani that were about to
depart sever had departur signal and were prepar to put to sea
at morn tide for in thi immens and admir port there is not
on dai in a hundr that vessel do not set out for everi quarter of
the globe but thei were mostli sail vessel of which of cours
philea fogg could make no us
he seem about to give up all hope when he espi anchor at the
batteri a cabl length off at most a trade vessel with a screw
wellshap whose funnel puf a cloud of smoke indic that she
wa get readi for departur
philea fogg hail a boat got into it and soon found himself on
board the henrietta ironhul woodbuilt abov he ascend to
the deck and ask for the captain who forthwith present himself
he wa a man of fifti a sort of seawolf with big ey a complexion
of oxidis copper red hair and thick neck and a growl voic
the captain ask mr fogg

the captain spoke in a tone which did not admit of a repli
but the owner of the henrietta resum philea fogg
the owner ar myself repli the captain the vessel belong to
me
i will freight it for you
no
i will bui it of you

philea fogg did not betrai the least disappoint but the situat
wa a grave on it wa not at new york as at hong kong nor with the
captain of the henrietta as with the captain of the tankader up
to thi time monei had smooth awai everi obstacl now monei fail
still some mean must be found to cross the atlant on a boat unless
by balloonwhich would have been venturesom besid not be capabl
of be put in practic it seem that philea fogg had an idea for
he said to the captain well will you carri me to bordeaux
no not if you paid me two hundr dollar
i offer you two thousand
apiec
apiec
and there ar four of you
four
captain speedi began to scratch hi head there were eight thousand
dollar to gain without chang hi rout for which it wa well
worth conquer the repugn he had for all kind of passeng
besid passeng at two thousand dollar ar no longer passeng
but valuabl merchandis i start at nine oclock said captain
speedi simpli ar you and your parti readi
we will be on board at nine oclock repli no less simpli mr
fogg
it wa halfpast eight to disembark from the henrietta jump into a
hack hurri to the st nichola and return with aouda passepartout
and even the insepar fix wa the work of a brief time and wa
perform by mr fogg with the cool which never abandon him thei
were on board when the henrietta made readi to weigh anchor
when passepartout heard what thi last voyag wa go to cost he
utter a prolong oh which extend throughout hi vocal gamut
as for fix he said to himself that the bank of england would certainli
not come out of thi affair well indemnifi when thei reach
england even if mr fogg did not throw some hand of bankbil
into the sea more than seven thousand pound would have been spent
chapter xxxiii
in which philea fogg show himself equal to the occas
an hour after the henrietta pass the lighthous which mark the
entranc of the hudson turn the point of sandi hook and put to sea
dure the dai she skirt long island pass fire island and
direct her cours rapidli eastward
at noon the next dai a man mount the bridg to ascertain the
vessel posit it might be thought that thi wa captain speedi
not the least in the world it wa philea fogg esquir as for
captain speedi he wa shut up in hi cabin under lock and kei and wa
utter loud cri which signifi an anger at onc pardon and
excess
what had happen wa veri simpl philea fogg wish to go to
liverpool but the captain would not carri him there then philea fogg
had taken passag for bordeaux and dure the thirti hour he had
been on board had so shrewdli manag with hi banknot that the
sailor and stoker who were onli an occasion crew and were not on
the best term with the captain went over to him in a bodi thi wa
why philea fogg wa in command instead of captain speedi why the
captain wa a prison in hi cabin and why in short the henrietta
wa direct her cours toward liverpool it wa veri clear to see
mr fogg manag the craft that he had been a sailor
how the adventur end will be seen anon aouda wa anxiou though
she said noth as for passepartout he thought mr fogg manuvr
simpli gloriou the captain had said between eleven and twelv
knot and the henrietta confirm hi predict
if thenfor there were if stillth sea did not becom too
boister if the wind did not veer round to the east if no accid
happen to the boat or it machineri the henrietta might cross the
three thousand mile from new york to liverpool in the nine dai
between the 12th and the 21st of decemb it is true that onc
arriv the affair on board the henrietta ad to that of the bank
of england might creat more difficulti for mr fogg than he
imagin or could desir
dure the first dai thei went along smoothli enough the sea wa not
veri unpropiti the wind seem stationari in the northeast the
sail were hoist and the henrietta plough across the wave like
a real transatlant steamer
passepartout wa delight hi master last exploit the consequ
of which he ignor enchant him never had the crew seen so jolli
and dexter a fellow he form warm friendship with the sailor
and amaz them with hi acrobat feat he thought thei manag the
vessel like gentlemen and that the stoker fire up like hero hi
loquaci goodhumour infect everyon he had forgotten the past
it vexat and delai he onli thought of the end so nearli
accomplish and sometim he boil over with impati as if
heat by the furnac of the henrietta often also the worthi
fellow revolv around fix look at him with a keen distrust
ey but he did not speak to him for their old intimaci no longer
exist
fix it must be confess understood noth of what wa go on the
conquest of the henrietta the briberi of the crew fogg manag the
boat like a skill seaman amaz and confus him he did not know
what to think for after all a man who began by steal fiftyf
thousand pound might end by steal a vessel and fix wa not
unnatur inclin to conclud that the henrietta under fogg
command wa not go to liverpool at all but to some part of the
world where the robber turn into a pirat would quietli put himself
in safeti the conjectur wa at least a plausibl on and the
detect began to serious regret that he had embark on the affair
as for captain speedi he continu to howl and growl in hi cabin and
passepartout whose duti it wa to carri him hi meal courag as
he wa took the greatest precaut mr fogg did not seem even to
know that there wa a captain on board
on the 13th thei pass the edg of the bank of newfoundland a
danger local dure the winter especi there ar frequent
fog and heavi gale of wind ever sinc the even befor the
baromet suddenli fall had indic an approach chang in the
atmospher and dure the night the temperatur vari the cold
becam sharper and the wind veer to the southeast
thi wa a misfortun mr fogg in order not to deviat from hi
cours furl hi sail and increas the forc of the steam but the
vessel speed slacken ow to the state of the sea the long wave
of which broke against the stern she pitch violent and thi
retard her progress the breez littl by littl swell into a
tempest and it wa to be fear that the henrietta might not be abl
to maintain herself upright on the wave
passepartout visag darken with the ski and for two dai the
poor fellow experienc constant fright but philea fogg wa a bold
marin and knew how to maintain headwai against the sea and he kept
on hi cours without even decreas hi steam the henrietta when
she could not rise upon the wave cross them swamp her deck but
pass safe sometim the screw rose out of the water beat it
protrud end when a mountain of water rais the stern abov the
wave but the craft alwai kept straight ahead
the wind howev did not grow as boister as might have been
fear it wa not on of those tempest which burst and rush on with
a speed of nineti mile an hour it continu fresh but unhappili it
remain obstin in the southeast render the sail useless
the 16th of decemb wa the seventyfifth dai sinc philea fogg
departur from london and the henrietta had not yet been serious
delai half of the voyag wa almost accomplish and the worst
local had been pass in summer success would have been
wellnigh certain in winter thei were at the merci of the bad season
passepartout said noth but he cherish hope in secret and
comfort himself with the reflect that if the wind fail them
thei might still count on the steam
on thi dai the engin came on deck went up to mr fogg and began
to speak earnestli with him without know why it wa a presenti
perhap passepartout becam vagu uneasi he would have given on of
hi ear to hear with the other what the engin wa sai he
final manag to catch a few word and wa sure he heard hi master
sai you ar certain of what you tell me
certain sir repli the engin you must rememb that sinc we
start we have kept up hot fire in all our furnac and though we
had coal enough to go on short steam from new york to bordeaux we
havent enough to go with all steam from new york to liverpool i
will consid repli mr fogg
passepartout understood it all he wa seiz with mortal anxieti the
coal wa give out ah if my master can get over that mutter he
hell be a famou man he could not help impart to fix what he had
overheard
then you believ that we realli ar go to liverpool
of cours
ass repli the detect shrug hi shoulder and turn on
hi heel
passepartout wa on the point of vigor resent the epithet the
reason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend but he
reflect that the unfortun fix wa probabl veri much disappoint
and humili in hi selfesteem after have so awkwardli follow a
fals scent around the world and refrain
and now what cours would philea fogg adopt it wa difficult to
imagin nevertheless he seem to have decid upon on for that
even he sent for the engin and said to him feed all the fire
until the coal is exhaust
a few moment after the funnel of the henrietta vomit forth
torrent of smoke the vessel continu to proce with all steam on
but on the 18th the engin as he had predict announc that the
coal would give out in the cours of the dai
do not let the fire go down repli mr fogg keep them up to the
last let the valv be fill
toward noon philea fogg have ascertain their posit call
passepartout and order him to go for captain speedi it wa as if
the honest fellow had been command to unchain a tiger he went to the
poop sai to himself he will be like a madman
in a few moment with cri and oath a bomb appear on the
poopdeck the bomb wa captain speedi it wa clear that he wa on the
point of burst where ar we were the first word hi anger
permit him to utter had the poor man been an apoplect he could
never have recov from hi paroxysm of wrath
where ar we he repeat with purpl face
seven hundr and seven mile from liverpool repli mr fogg with
imperturb calm

but i shall be oblig to burn her
burn the henrietta
ye at least the upper part of her the coal ha given out
burn my vessel cri captain speedi who could scarc pronounc
the word a vessel worth fifti thousand dollar
here ar sixti thousand repli philea fogg hand the captain a
roll of bankbil thi had a prodigi effect on andrew speedi an
american can scarc remain unmov at the sight of sixti thousand
dollar the captain forgot in an instant hi anger hi imprison
and all hi grudg against hi passeng the henrietta wa twenti
year old it wa a great bargain the bomb would not go off after all
mr fogg had taken awai the match
and i shall still have the iron hull said the captain in a softer
tone
the iron hull and the engin is it agre
agre
and andrew speedi seiz the banknot count them and consign
them to hi pocket
dure thi colloqui passepartout wa as white as a sheet and fix
seem on the point of have an apoplect fit nearli twenti thousand
pound had been expend and fogg left the hull and engin to the
captain that is near the whole valu of the craft it wa true
howev that fiftyf thousand pound had been stolen from the bank
when andrew speedi had pocket the monei mr fogg said to him dont
let thi astonish you sir you must know that i shall lose twenti
thousand pound unless i arriv in london by a quarter befor nine on
the even of the 21st of decemb i miss the steamer at new york
and as you refus to take me to liverpool
and i did well cri andrew speedi for i have gain at least
forti thousand dollar by it he ad more sedat do you know

wa go awai when mr fogg said the vessel now belong to me
certainli from the keel to the truck of the mastsal the wood that
is
veri well have the interior seat bunk and frame pull down and
burn them
it wa necessari to have dry wood to keep the steam up to the adequ
pressur and on that dai the poop cabin bunk and the spare deck
were sacrif on the next dai the 19th of decemb the mast
raft and spar were burn the crew work lustili keep up the
fire passepartout hew cut and saw awai with all hi might
there wa a perfect rage for demolit
the rail fit the greater part of the deck and top side

attempt to do noth to save her protector she wept bitterli
as for fix he had arrest mr fogg becaus it wa hi duti whether

the thought then struck passepartout that he wa the caus of thi new
misfortun had he not conceal fix errand from hi master when fix

if the latter had been warn he would no doubt have given fix proof
of hi innoc and satisfi him of hi mistak at least fix would

chapter xxxvi
in which philea fogg name is onc more at a premium on chang
it is time to relat what a chang took place in english public opinion
when it transpir that the real bankrobb a certain jame strand
had been arrest on the 17th dai of decemb at edinburgh three
dai befor philea fogg had been a crimin who wa be
desper follow up by the polic now he wa an honour
gentleman mathemat pursu hi eccentr journei round the
world
the paper resum their discuss about the wager all those who had
laid bet for or against him reviv their interest as if by magic
the philea fogg bond again becam negoti and mani new wager
were made philea fogg name wa onc more at a premium on chang
hi five friend of the reform club pass these three dai in a state
of feverish suspens would philea fogg whom thei had forgotten
reappear befor their ey where wa he at thi moment the 17th of
decemb the dai of jame strand arrest wa the seventysixth sinc
philea fogg departur and no new of him had been receiv wa he
dead had he abandon the effort or wa he continu hi journei
along the rout agre upon and would he appear on saturdai the 21st
of decemb at a quarter befor nine in the even on the threshold
of the reform club saloon
the anxieti in which for three dai london societi exist cannot be
describ telegram were sent to america and asia for new of philea
fogg messeng were dispatch to the hous in savil row morn
and even no new the polic were ignor what had becom of the
detect fix who had so unfortun follow up a fals scent
bet increas nevertheless in number and valu philea fogg like a
racehors wa draw near hi last turningpoint the bond were
quot no longer at a hundr below par but at twenti at ten and at
five and paralyt old lord albemarl bet even in hi favour
a great crowd wa collect in pall mall and the neighbour street
on saturdai even it seem like a multitud of broker perman
establish around the reform club circul wa imped and
everywher disput discuss and financi transact were go
on the polic had great difficulti in keep back the crowd and as
the hour when philea fogg wa due approach the excit rose to
it highest pitch
the five antagonist of philea fogg had met in the great saloon of the
club john sullivan and samuel fallentin the banker andrew stuart
the engin gauthier ralph the director of the bank of england and
thoma flanagan the brewer on and all wait anxious
when the clock indic twenti minut past eight andrew stuart got
up sai gentlemen in twenti minut the time agre upon between
mr fogg and ourselv will have expir
what time did the last train arriv from liverpool ask thoma
flanagan
at twentythre minut past seven repli gauthier ralph and the
next doe not arriv till ten minut after twelv
well gentlemen resum andrew stuart if philea fogg had come in
the 723 train he would have got here by thi time we can therefor
regard the bet as won
wait dont let us be too hasti repli samuel fallentin you know
that mr fogg is veri eccentr hi punctual is well known he
never arriv too soon or too late and i should not be surpris if
he appear befor us at the last minut
why said andrew stuart nervous if i should see him i should not
believ it wa he
the fact is resum thoma flanagan mr fogg project wa
absurdli foolish whatev hi punctual he could not prevent the
delai which were certain to occur and a delai of onli two or three
dai would be fatal to hi tour
observ too ad john sullivan that we have receiv no
intellig from him though there ar telegraph line all along hi
rout
he ha lost gentleman said andrew stuart he ha a hundr time
lost you know besid that the chinath onli steamer he could
have taken from new york to get here in time arriv yesterdai i have
seen a list of the passeng and the name of philea fogg is not
among them even if we admit that fortun ha favour him he can
scarc have reach america i think he will be at least twenti dai
behindhand and that lord albemarl will lose a cool five thousand
it is clear repli gauthier ralph and we have noth to do but
to present mr fogg chequ at bare tomorrow
at thi moment the hand of the club clock point to twenti minut
to nine
five minut more said andrew stuart
the five gentlemen look at each other their anxieti wa becom
intens but not wish to betrai it thei readili assent to mr
fallentin propos of a rubber
i wouldnt give up my four thousand of the bet said andrew stuart
as he took hi seat for three thousand nine hundr and ninetynin
the clock indic eighteen minut to nine
the player took up their card but could not keep their ey off the
clock certainli howev secur thei felt minut had never seem so
long to them
seventeen minut to nine said thoma flanagan as he cut the card
which ralph hand to him
then there wa a moment of silenc the great saloon wa perfectli
quiet but the murmur of the crowd outsid were heard with now and
then a shrill cry the pendulum beat the second which each player
eagerli count as he listen with mathemat regular
sixteen minut to nine said john sullivan in a voic which
betrai hi emot
on minut more and the wager would be won andrew stuart and hi
partner suspend their game thei left their card and count the
second
at the fortieth second noth at the fiftieth still noth
at the fiftyfifth a loud cry wa heard in the street follow by
applaus hurrah and some fierc growl
the player rose from their seat
at the fiftyseventh second the door of the saloon open and the
pendulum had not beat the sixtieth second when philea fogg appear
follow by an excit crowd who had forc their wai through the club
door and in hi calm voic said here i am gentlemen
chapter xxxvii
in which it is shown that philea fogg gain noth by hi tour
around the world unless it were happi
ye philea fogg in person
the reader will rememb that at five minut past eight in the
eveningabout five and twenti hour after the arriv of the travel
in londonpassepartout had been sent by hi master to engag the
servic of the reverend samuel wilson in a certain marriag ceremoni
which wa to take place the next dai
passepartout went on hi errand enchant he soon reach the
clergyman hous but found him not at home passepartout wait a
good twenti minut and when he left the reverend gentleman it wa
thirtyf minut past eight but in what a state he wa with hi
hair in disord and without hi hat he ran along the street as never
man wa seen to run befor overturn passersbi rush over the
sidewalk like a waterspout
in three minut he wa in savil row again and stagger back into
mr fogg room
he could not speak
what is the matter ask mr fogg

the clock indic a quarter befor nine when he appear in the great
saloon
philea fogg had accomplish the journei round the world in eighti
dai
philea fogg had won hi wager of twenti thousand pound
how wa it that a man so exact and fastidi could have made thi
error of a dai how came he to think that he had arriv in london on
saturdai the twentyfirst dai of decemb when it wa realli fridai
the twentieth the seventyninth dai onli from hi departur
the caus of the error is veri simpl
philea fogg had without suspect it gain on dai on hi journei
and thi mere becaus he had travel constantli eastward he
would on the contrari have lost a dai had he gone in the opposit
direct that is westward
in journei eastward he had gone toward the sun and the dai
therefor diminish for him as mani time four minut as he cross
degre in thi direct there ar three hundr and sixti degre on
the circumfer of the earth and these three hundr and sixti
degre multipli by four minut give precis twentyfour
hoursthat is the dai unconsci gain in other word while
philea fogg go eastward saw the sun pass the meridian eighti
time hi friend in london onli saw it pass the meridian
seventynin time thi is why thei await him at the reform club
on saturdai and not sundai as mr fogg thought
and passepartout famou famili watch which had alwai kept london
time would have betrai thi fact if it had mark the dai as well
as the hour and the minut
philea fogg then had won the twenti thousand pound but as he had
spent nearli nineteen thousand on the wai the pecuniari gain wa
small hi object wa howev to be victori and not to win monei
he divid the on thousand pound that remain between passepartout
and the unfortun fix against whom he cherish no grudg he
deduct howev from passepartout share the cost of the ga which
had burn in hi room for nineteen hundr and twenti hour for the
sake of regular
that even mr fogg as tranquil and phlegmat as ever said to
aouda is our marriag still agreeabl to you
mr fogg repli she it is for me to ask that question you were
ruin but now you ar rich again
pardon me madam my fortun belong to you if you had not suggest
our marriag my servant would not have gone to the reverend samuel
wilson i should not have been appris of my error and
dear mr fogg said the young woman
dear aouda repli philea fogg
it need not be said that the marriag took place fortyeight hour
after and that passepartout glow and dazzl gave the bride
awai had he not save her and wa he not entitl to thi honour
the next dai as soon as it wa light passepartout rap vigor
