prefaratori
it wa with consider reluct that i abandon in favour of the
present undertak what had long been a favourit project that of a
new edit of shelton don quixot which ha now becom a somewhat
scarc book there ar someand i confess myself to be onefor whom
shelton raci old version with all it defect ha a charm that no
modern translat howev skil or correct could possess shelton
had the inestim advantag of belong to the same gener as
cervant don quixot had to him a vital that onli a contemporari
could feel it cost him no dramat effort to see thing as cervant
saw them there is no anachron in hi languag he put the spanish
of cervant into the english of shakespear shakespear himself most
like knew the book he mai have carri it home with him in hi
saddlebag to stratford on on of hi last journei and under the
mulberri tree at new place join hand with a kindr geniu in it
page
but it wa soon made plain to me that to hope for even a moder
popular for shelton wa vain hi fine old crust english would no
doubt be relish by a minor but it would be onli by a minor
hi warmest admir must admit that he is not a satisfactori
repres of cervant hi translat of the first part wa veri
hastili made and wa never revis by him it ha all the fresh and
vigour but also a full measur of the fault of a hasti product
it is often veri literalbarbar liter frequentlybut just as
often veri loos he had evid a good colloqui knowledg of
spanish but appar not much more it never seem to occur to him
that the same translat of a word will not suit in everi case
it is often said that we have no satisfactori translat of don
quixot to those who ar familiar with the origin it savour of
truism or platitud to sai so for in truth there can be no thoroughli
satisfactori translat of don quixot into english or ani other
languag it is not that the spanish idiom ar so utterli
unmanag or that the untranslat word numer enough no
doubt ar so superabund but rather that the sententi ters
to which the humour of the book ow it flavour is peculiar to
spanish and can at best be onli distantli imit in ani other
tongu
the histori of our english translat of don quixot is
instruct shelton the first in ani languag wa made
appar about 1608 but not publish till 1612 thi of cours wa
onli the first part it ha been assert that the second publish in
1620 is not the work of shelton but there is noth to support the
assert save the fact that it ha less spirit less of what we
gener understand by go about it than the first which would be
onli natur if the first were the work of a young man write
current calamo and the second that of a middleag man write for
a booksel on the other hand it is closer and more liter the
style is the same the veri same translat or mistransl
occur in it and it is extrem unlik that a new translat would
by suppress hi name have allow shelton to carri off the credit
in 1687 john phillip milton nephew produc a don quixot made
english he sai accord to the humour of our modern languag
hi quixot is not so much a translat as a travesti and a
travesti that for coars vulgar and buffooneri is almost
unexampl even in the literatur of that dai
ned ward life and notabl adventur of don quixot merrili
translat into hudibrast vers 1700 can scarc be reckon a
translat but it serv to show the light in which don quixot wa
regard at the time
a further illustr mai be found in the version publish in 1712 by
peter motteux who had then recent combin teadeal with
literatur it is describ as translat from the origin by sever
hand but if so all spanish flavour ha entir evapor under the
manipul of the sever hand the flavour that it ha on the
other hand is distinctli francococknei anyon who compar it
carefulli with the origin will have littl doubt that it is a
concoct from shelton and the french of filleau de saint martin ek
out by borrow from phillip whose mode of treatment it adopt it
is to be sure more decent and decor but it treat don quixot
in the same fashion as a comic book that cannot be made too comic
to attempt to improv the humour of don quixot by an infus of
cocknei flippanc and faceti as motteux oper did is not
mere an impertin like lard a sirloin of prize beef but an
absolut falsif of the spirit of the book and it is a proof of
the uncrit wai in which don quixot is gener read that thi
wors than worthless translationworthless as fail to repres
wors than worthless as misrepresentingshould have been favour as it
ha been
it had the effect howev of bring out a translat undertaken
and execut in a veri differ spirit that of charl jerva the
portrait painter and friend of pope swift arbuthnot and gai jerva
ha been allow littl credit for hi work inde it mai be said
none for it is known to the world in gener as jarviss it wa not
publish until after hi death and the printer gave the name
accord to the current pronunci of the dai it ha been the most
freeli us and the most freeli abus of all the translat it ha
seen far more edit than ani other it is admit on all hand to
be by far the most faith and yet nobodi seem to have a good word
to sai for it or for it author jerva no doubt prejud reader
against himself in hi prefac where among mani true word about
shelton steven and motteux he rashli and unjustli charg shelton
with have translat not from the spanish but from the italian
version of franciosini which did not appear until ten year after
shelton first volum a suspicion of incompet too seem to have
attach to him becaus he wa by profess a painter and a mediocr
on though he ha given us the best portrait we have of swift and
thi mai have been strengthen by pope remark that he translat
don quixot without understand spanish he ha been also charg
with borrow from shelton whom he disparag it is true that in a
few difficult or obscur passag he ha follow shelton and gone
astrai with him but for on case of thi sort there ar fifti where
he is right and shelton wrong as for pope dictum anyon who
examin jervass version carefulli side by side with the origin
will see that he wa a sound spanish scholar incompar a better on
than shelton except perhap in mere colloqui spanish he wa in
fact an honest faith and painstak translat and he ha left
a version which whatev it shortcom mai be is singularli free
from error and mistransl
the charg against it is that it is stiff drywooden in a wordand
no on can deni that there is a foundat for it but it mai be
plead for jerva that a good deal of thi rigid is due to hi
abhorr of the light flippant jocos style of hi predecessor he
wa on of the few veri few translat that have shown ani
apprehens of the unsmil graviti which is the essenc of quixot
humour it seem to him a crime to bring cervant forward smirk
and grin at hi own good thing and to thi mai be attribut in a
great measur the ascet abstin from everyth savour of
liveli which is the characterist of hi translat in most
modern edit it should be observ hi style ha been smooth and
smarten but without ani refer to the origin spanish so that
if he ha been made to read more agreeabl he ha also been rob of
hi chief merit of fidel
smollett version publish in 1755 mai be almost count as on of
these at ani rate it is plain that in it construct jervass
translat wa veri freeli drawn upon and veri littl or probabl no
heed given to the origin spanish
the later translat mai be dismiss in a few word georg kelli
which appear in 1769 print for the translat wa an impud
impostur be noth more than motteux version with a few of the
word here and there artfulli transpos charl wilmot 1774 wa
onli an abridg like florian but not so skilfulli execut and
the version publish by miss smirk in 1818 to accompani her
brother plate wa mere a patchwork product made out of former
translat on the latest mr a j duffield it would be in everi
sens of the word impertin in me to offer an opinion here i had not
even seen it when the present undertak wa propos to me and sinc
then i mai sai vidi tantum have for obviou reason resist the
temptat which mr duffield reput and come volum hold out
to everi lover of cervant
from the forego histori of our translat of don quixot it
will be seen that there ar a good mani peopl who provid thei get
the mere narr with it full complement of fact incid and
adventur serv up to them in a form that amus them care veri
littl whether that form is the on in which cervant origin
shape hi idea on the other hand it is clear that there ar mani
who desir to have not mere the stori he tell but the stori as he
tell it so far at least as differ of idiom and circumst
permit and who will give a prefer to the conscienti translat
even though he mai have acquit himself somewhat awkwardli
but after all there is no real antagon between the two class
there is no reason why what pleas the on should not pleas the
other or why a translat who make it hi aim to treat don quixot
with the respect due to a great classic should not be as accept
even to the careless reader as the on who treat it as a famou old
jestbook it is not a question of caviar to the gener or if it
is the fault rest with him who make so the method by which
cervant won the ear of the spanish peopl ought mutati mutandi to
be equal effect with the great major of english reader at ani
rate even if there ar reader to whom it is a matter of indiffer
fidel to the method is as much a part of the translat duti as
fidel to the matter if he can pleas all parti so much the
better but hi first duti is to those who look to him for as faith
a represent of hi author as it is in hi power to give them
faith to the letter so long as fidel is practic faith to
the spirit so far as he can make it
my purpos here is not to dogmatis on the rule of translat but to
indic those i have follow or at least tri to the best of my
abil to follow in the present instanc on which it seem to me
cannot be too rigidli follow in translat don quixot is to
avoid everyth that savour of affect the book itself is
inde in on sens a protest against it and no man abhor it more
than cervant for thi reason i think ani temptat to us
antiqu or obsolet languag should be resist it is after all an
affect and on for which there is no warrant or excus spanish
ha probabl undergon less chang sinc the seventeenth centuri than
ani languag in europ and by far the greater and certainli the best
part of don quixot differ but littl in languag from the
colloqui spanish of the present dai except in the tale and don
quixot speech the translat who us the simplest and plainest
everydai languag will almost alwai be the on who approach nearest
to the origin
see that the stori of don quixot and all it charact and
incid have now been for more than two centuri and a half familiar
as household word in english mouth it seem to me that the old
familiar name and phrase should not be chang without good reason
of cours a translat who hold that don quixot should receiv the
treatment a great classic deserv will feel himself bound by the
injunct laid upon the morisco in chap ix not to omit or add
anyth
cervant
four gener had laugh over don quixot befor it occur to
anyon to ask who and what manner of man wa thi miguel de cervant
saavedra whose name is on the titlepag and it wa too late for a
satisfactori answer to the question when it wa propos to add a life
of the author to the london edit publish at lord carteret
instanc in 1738 all trace of the person of cervant had by
that time disappear ani float tradit that mai onc have
exist transmit from men who had known him had long sinc di
out and of other record there wa none for the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuri were incuri as to the men of the time a
reproach against which the nineteenth ha at ani rate secur itself
if it ha produc no shakespear or cervant all that mayan y
siscar to whom the task wa entrust or ani of those who follow
him rio pellic or navarret could do wa to ek out the few
allus cervant make to himself in hi variou prefac with such
piec of documentari evid bear upon hi life as thei could
find
thi howev ha been done by the lastnam biograph to such good
purpos that he ha supersed all predecessor thorough is the
chief characterist of navarret work besid sift test and
methodis with rare patienc and judgment what had been previous
brought to light he left as the sai is no stone unturn under
which anyth to illustr hi subject might possibl be found
navarret ha done all that industri and acumen could do and it is no
fault of hi if he ha not given us what we want what hallam sai of
shakespear mai be appli to the almost parallel case of cervant
it is not the regist of hi baptism or the draft of hi will or
the orthographi of hi name that we seek no letter of hi write no
record of hi convers no charact of him drawn by a
contemporari ha been produc
it is onli natur therefor that the biograph of cervant
forc to make brick without straw should have recours larg to
conjectur and that conjectur should in some instanc come by
degre to take the place of establish fact all that i propos to do
here is to separ what is matter of fact from what is matter of
conjectur and leav it to the reader judgment to decid whether the
data justifi the infer or not
the men whose name by common consent stand in the front rank of
spanish literatur cervant lope de vega quevedo calderon
garcilaso de la vega the mendoza gongora were all men of ancient
famili and curious all except the last of famili that trace
their origin to the same mountain district in the north of spain the
famili of cervant is commonli said to have been of galician origin
and unquestion it wa in possess of land in galicia at a veri
earli date but i think the balanc of the evid tend to show that
the solar the origin site of the famili wa at cervato in the
northwest corner of old castil close to the junction of castil
leon and the asturia as it happen there is a complet histori of
the cervant famili from the tenth centuri down to the seventeenth
extant under the titl of illustri ancestri gloriou deed and
nobl poster of the famou nuno alfonso alcaid of toledo written
in 1648 by the industri genealogist rodrigo mendez silva who
avail himself of a manuscript genealog by juan de mena the poet
laureat and historiograph of john ii
the origin of the name cervant is curiou nuno alfonso wa almost as
distinguish in the struggl against the moor in the reign of alfonso
vii as the cid had been half a centuri befor in that of alfonso vi
and wa reward by diver grant of land in the neighbourhood of
toledo on on of hi acquisit about two leagu from the citi he
built himself a castl which he call cervato becaus he wa lord
of the solar of cervato in the montana as the mountain region
extend from the basqu provinc to leon wa alwai call at hi
death in battl in 1143 the castl pass by hi will to hi son
alfonso munio who as territori or local surnam were then come
into vogu in place of the simpl patronym took the addit name
of cervato hi eldest son pedro succeed him in the possess of
the castl and follow hi exampl in adopt the name an
assumpt at which the younger son gonzalo seem to have taken
umbrag
everyon who ha paid even a fly visit to toledo will rememb the
ruin castl that crown the hill abov the spot where the bridg of

the pedigre of cervant is not without it bear on don quixot
a man who could look back upon an ancestri of genuin knightserr
extend from wellnigh the time of pelayo to the sieg of granada wa
like to have a strong feel on the subject of the sham chivalri of
the romanc it give a point too to what he sai in more than on
place about famili that have onc been great and have taper awai
until thei have come to noth like a pyramid it wa the case of hi
own
he wa born at alcal de henar and baptis in the church of santa
maria mayor on the 9th of octob 1547 of hi boyhood and youth we
know noth unless it be from the glimps he give us in the prefac
to hi comedi of himself as a boi look on with delight while
lope de rueda and hi compani set up their rude plank stage in the
plaza and act the rustic farc which he himself afterward took as
the model of hi interlud thi first glimps howev is a
signific on for it show the earli develop of that love of the
drama which exercis such an influenc on hi life and seem to have
grown stronger as he grew older and of which thi veri prefac
written onli a few month befor hi death is such a strike proof
he give us to understand too that he wa a great reader in hi
youth but of thi no assur wa need for the first part of don
quixot alon prove a vast amount of miscellan read romanc
of chivalri ballad popular poetri chronicl for which he had no
time or opportun except in the first twenti year of hi life and
hi misquot and mistak in matter of detail ar alwai it mai
be notic those of a man recal the read of hi boyhood
other thing besid the drama were in their infanc when cervant wa
a boi the period of hi boyhood wa in everi wai a transit period
for spain the old chivalr spain had pass awai the new spain wa
the mightiest power the world had seen sinc the roman empir and it
had not yet been call upon to pai the price of it great by the
polici of ferdinand and ximenez the sovereign had been made absolut
and the church and inquisit adroitli adjust to keep him so the
nobl who had alwai resist absolut as strenuous as thei had
fought the moor had been divest of all polit power a like fate
had befallen the citi the free constitut of castil and aragon
had been swept awai and the onli function that remain to the cort
wa that of grant monei at the king dictat
the transit extend to literatur men who like garcilaso de la
vega and diego hurtado de mendoza follow the italian war had
brought back from itali the product of the postrenaiss
literatur which took root and flourish and even threaten to
extinguish the nativ growth damon and thyrsi phylli and chloe had
been fairli naturalis in spain togeth with all the devic of
pastor poetri for invest with an air of novelti the idea of a
dispair shepherd and inflex shepherdess as a setoff against
thi the old histor and tradit ballad and the true
pastor the song and ballad of peasant life were be collect
assidu and print in the cancionero that succeed on anoth
with increas rapid but the most notabl consequ perhap of
the spread of print wa the flood of romanc of chivalri that had
continu to pour from the press ever sinc garci ordoez de montalvo
had resuscit amadi of gaul at the begin of the centuri
for a youth fond of read solid or light there could have been no
better spot in spain than alcal de henar in the middl of the
sixteenth centuri it wa then a busi popul univers town
someth more than the enterpris rival of salamanca and altogeth
a veri differ place from the melancholi silent desert alcal the
travel see now as he goe from madrid to saragossa theologi and
medicin mai have been the strong point of the univers but the
town itself seem to have inclin rather to the human and light
literatur and as a produc of book alcal wa alreadi begin to
compet with the older press of toledo burgo salamanca and
sevil
a pendant to the pictur cervant ha given us of hi first playgo
might no doubt have been often seen in the street of alcal at that
time a bright eager tawnyhair boi peer into a bookshop where
the latest volum lai open to tempt the public wonder it mai be
what that littl book with the woodcut of the blind beggar and hi boi
that call itself vida de lazarillo de torm segunda impres
could be about or with ey brim over with merriment gaze at on
of those preposter portrait of a knighterr in outrag
panopli and plume with which the publish of chivalri romanc love
to embellish the titlepag of their folio if the boi wa the father
of the man the sens of the incongru that wa strong at fifti wa
live at ten and some such reflect as these mai have been the
true genesi of don quixot
for hi more solid educ we ar told he went to salamanca but
why rodrigo de cervant who wa veri poor should have sent hi son
to a univers a hundr and fifti mile awai when he had on at hi
own door would be a puzzl if we had ani reason for suppos that he
did so the onli evid is a vagu statement by professor toma
gonzalez that he onc saw an old entri of the matricul of a
miguel de cervant thi doe not appear to have been ever seen again
but even if it had and if the date correspond it would prove
noth as there were at least two other miguel born about the middl
of the centuri on of them moreov a cervant saavedra a cousin
no doubt who wa a sourc of great embarrass to the biograph
that he wa a student neither at salamanca nor at alcal is best prove
by hi own work no man drew more larg upon experi than he did
and he ha nowher left a singl reminisc of student lifefor the
tia fingida if it be hi is not onenoth not even a colleg
joke to show that he rememb dai that most men rememb best all
that we know posit about hi educ is that juan lopez de
hoyo a professor of human and belleslettr of some emin
call him hi dear and belov pupil thi wa in a littl collect
of vers by differ hand on the death of isabel de valoi second
queen of philip ii publish by the professor in 1569 to which
cervant contribut four piec includ an elegi and an epitaph
in the form of a sonnet it is onli by a rare chanc that a lycida
find it wai into a volum of thi sort and cervant wa no milton
hi vers ar no wors than such thing usual ar so much at
least mai be said for them
by the time the book appear he had left spain and as fate order
it for twelv year the most event on of hi life giulio
afterward cardin acquaviva had been sent at the end of 1568 to
philip ii by the pope on a mission partli of condol partli
polit and on hi return to rome which wa somewhat brusqu
expedit by the king he took cervant with him as hi camarero
chamberlain the offic he himself held in the pope household the
post would no doubt have led to advanc at the papal court had
cervant retain it but in the summer of 1570 he resign it and
enlist as a privat soldier in captain diego urbina compani
belong to don miguel de moncada regiment but at that time form
a part of the command of marc antoni colonna what impel him to thi
step we know not whether it wa distast for the career befor him or
pure militari enthusiasm it mai well have been the latter for it
wa a stir time the event howev which led to the allianc
between spain venic and the pope against the common enemi the
port and to the victori of the combin fleet at lepanto belong
rather to the histori of europ than to the life of cervant he wa
on of those that sail from messina in septemb 1571 under the
command of don john of austria but on the morn of the 7th of
octob when the turkish fleet wa sight he wa ly below ill
with fever at the new that the enemi wa in sight he rose and in
spite of the remonstr of hi comrad and superior insist on
take hi post sai he prefer death in the servic of god and
the king to health hi gallei the marquesa wa in the thick of the
fight and befor it wa over he had receiv three gunshot wound two
in the breast and on in the left hand or arm on the morn after the
battl accord to navarret he had an interview with the
commanderinchief don john who wa make a person inspect of
the wound on result of which wa an addit of three crown to hi
pai and anoth appar the friendship of hi gener
how sever cervant wa wound mai be infer from the fact that
with youth a vigor frame and as cheer and buoyant a tempera
as ever invalid had he wa seven month in hospit at messina befor
he wa discharg he came out with hi left hand perman disabl
he had lost the us of it as mercuri told him in the viaj del
parnaso for the greater glori of the right thi howev did not
absolut unfit him for servic and in april 1572 he join manuel
ponc de leon compani of lope de figueroa regiment in which it
seem probabl hi brother rodrigo wa serv and share in the
oper of the next three year includ the captur of the
goletta and tuni take advantag of the lull which follow the
recaptur of these place by the turk he obtain leav to return to
spain and sail from napl in septemb 1575 on board the sun

late governor of the goletta and some other and furnish with
letter from don john of austria and the duke of sesa the viceroi of
sicili recommend him to the king for the command of a compani on
account of hi servic a dono infelic as event prove on the
26th thei fell in with a squadron of algerin gallei and after a
stout resist were overpow and carri into algier
by mean of a ransom fellowcapt the brother contriv to inform
their famili of their condit and the poor peopl at alcal at onc
strove to rais the ransom monei the father dispos of all he
possess and the two sister give up their marriag portion but
dali mami had found on cervant the letter address to the king by
don john and the duke of sesa and conclud that hi prize must be a
person of great consequ when the monei came he refus it
scornfulli as be altogeth insuffici the owner of rodrigo
howev wa more easili satisfi ransom wa accept in hi case
and it wa arrang between the brother that he should return to spain
and procur a vessel in which he wa to come back to algier and take
off miguel and as mani of their comrad as possibl thi wa not the
first attempt to escap that cervant had made soon after the
commenc of hi captiv he induc sever of hi companion to
join him in try to reach oran then a spanish post on foot but
after the first dai journei the moor who had agre to act as their
guid desert them and thei had no choic but to return the second
attempt wa more disastr in a garden outsid the citi on the
seashor he construct with the help of the garden a spaniard a
hidingplac to which he brought on by on fourteen of hi
fellowcapt keep them there in secreci for sever month and
suppli them with food through a renegad known as el dorador the
gilder how he a captiv himself contriv to do all thi is on of
the mysteri of the stori wild as the project mai appear it wa veri
nearli success the vessel procur by rodrigo made it appear
off the coast and under cover of night wa proceed to take off the
refuge when the crew were alarm by a pass fish boat and
beat a hasti retreat on renew the attempt shortli afterward thei
or a portion of them at least were taken prison and just as the
poor fellow in the garden were exult in the thought that in a few
moment more freedom would be within their grasp thei found themselv
surround by turkish troop hors and foot the dorador had reveal
the whole scheme to the dei hassan
when cervant saw what had befallen them he charg hi companion to
lai all the blame upon him and as thei were be bound he declar
aloud that the whole plot wa of hi contriv and that nobodi els
had ani share in it brought befor the dei he said the same he wa
threaten with impal and with tortur and as cut off ear
and nose were play freak with the algerin it mai be conceiv
what their tortur were like but noth could make him swerv from
hi origin statement that he and he alon wa respons the upshot
wa that the unhappi garden wa hang by hi master and the
prison taken possess of by the dei who howev afterward
restor most of them to their master but kept cervant pai dali
mami 500 crown for him he felt no doubt that a man of such
resourc energi and dare wa too danger a piec of properti to
be left in privat hand and he had him heavili iron and lodg in
hi own prison if he thought that by these mean he could break the
spirit or shake the resolut of hi prison he wa soon undeceiv
for cervant contriv befor long to despatch a letter to the
governor of oran entreat him to send him someon that could be
trust to enabl him and three other gentlemen fellowcapt of
hi to make their escap intend evid to renew hi first
attempt with a more trustworthi guid unfortun the moor who
carri the letter wa stop just outsid oran and the letter be
found upon him he wa sent back to algier where by the order of the
dei he wa promptli impal as a warn to other while cervant wa
condemn to receiv two thousand blow of the stick a number which
most like would have depriv the world of don quixot had not
some person who thei were we know not interced on hi behalf
after thi he seem to have been kept in still closer confin than
befor for nearli two year pass befor he made anoth attempt
thi time hi plan wa to purchas by the aid of a spanish renegad
and two valencian merchant resid in algier an arm vessel in
which he and about sixti of the lead captiv were to make their
escap but just as thei were about to put it into execut on doctor
juan blanco de paz an ecclesiast and a compatriot inform the dei
of the plot cervant by forc of charact by hi selfdevot by
hi untir energi and hi exert to lighten the lot of hi
companion in miseri had endear himself to all and becom the
lead spirit in the captiv coloni and incred as it mai seem
jealousi of hi influenc and the esteem in which he wa held move
thi man to compass hi destruct by a cruel death the merchant
find that the dei knew all and fear that cervant under tortur
might make disclosur that would imperil their own live tri to
persuad him to slip awai on board a vessel that wa on the point of
sail for spain but he told them thei had noth to fear for no
tortur would make him compromis anybodi and he went at onc and
gave himself up to the dei
as befor the dei tri to forc him to name hi accomplic
everyth wa made readi for hi immedi execut the halter wa
put round hi neck and hi hand ti behind him but all that could be
got from him wa that he himself with the help of four gentlemen who
had sinc left algier had arrang the whole and that the sixti who
were to accompani him were not to know anyth of it until the last
moment find he could make noth of him the dei sent him back to
prison more heavili iron than befor
the povertystricken cervant famili had been all thi time try
onc more to rais the ransom monei and at last a sum of three hundr
ducat wa got togeth and entrust to the redemptorist father juan
gil who wa about to sail for algier the dei howev demand more
than doubl the sum offer and as hi term of offic had expir and
he wa about to sail for constantinopl take all hi slave with
him the case of cervant wa critic he wa alreadi on board
heavili iron when the dei at length agre to reduc hi demand by
onehalf and father gil by borrow wa abl to make up the amount
and on septemb 19 1580 after a captiv of five year all but a
week cervant wa at last set free befor long he discov that
blanco de paz who claim to be an offic of the inquisit wa now
concoct on fals evid a charg of misconduct to be brought
against him on hi return to spain to checkmat him cervant drew up
a seri of twentyf question cover the whole period of hi
captiv upon which he request father gil to take the deposit
of credibl wit befor a notari eleven wit taken from
among the princip captiv in algier depos to all the fact abov
state and to a great deal more besid there is someth touch in
the admir love and gratitud we see struggl to find
express in the formal languag of the notari as thei testifi on
after anoth to the good deed of cervant how he comfort and
help the weakheart how he kept up their droop courag how he
share hi poor purs with thi depon and how in him thi depon
found father and mother
on hi return to spain he found hi old regiment about to march for
portug to support philip claim to the crown and utterli penniless
now had no choic but to rejoin it he wa in the expedit to the
azor in 1582 and the follow year and on the conclus of the war
return to spain in the autumn of 1583 bring with him the
manuscript of hi pastor romanc the galatea and probabl also
to judg by intern evid that of the first portion of persil
and sigismunda he also brought back with him hi biograph assert
an infant daughter the offspr of an amour as some of them with
great circumstanti inform us with a lisbon ladi of nobl birth
whose name howev as well as that of the street she live in thei
omit to mention the sole foundat for all thi is that in 1605 there
certainli wa live in the famili of cervant a doa isabel de
saavedra who is describ in an offici document as hi natur
daughter and then twenti year of ag
with hi crippl left hand promot in the armi wa hopeless now
that don john wa dead and he had no on to press hi claim and
servic and for a man draw on to forti life in the rank wa a
dismal prospect he had alreadi a certain reput as a poet he made
up hi mind therefor to cast hi lot with literatur and for a
first ventur commit hi galatea to the press it wa publish
as salva y mallen show conclus at alcal hi own birthplac
in 1585 and no doubt help to make hi name more wide known but
certainli did not do him much good in ani other wai
while it wa go through the press he marri doa catalina de
palacio salazar y vozmediano a ladi of esquivia near madrid and
appar a friend of the famili who brought him a fortun which mai
possibl have serv to keep the wolf from the door but if so that
wa all the drama had by thi time outgrown marketplac stage and
stroll compani and with hi old love for it he natur turn
to it for a congeni employ in about three year he wrote twenti
or thirti plai which he tell us were perform without ani throw
of cucumb or other missil and ran their cours without ani
hiss outcri or disturb in other word hi plai were not
bad enough to be hiss off the stage but not good enough to hold
their own upon it onli two of them have been preserv but as thei
happen to be two of the seven or eight he mention with complac we
mai assum thei ar favour specimen and no on who read the
numancia and the trato de argel will feel ani surpris that thei
fail as act drama whatev merit thei mai have whatev
occasion thei mai show thei ar as regard construct incur
clumsi how complet thei fail is manifest from the fact that with
all hi sanguin tempera and indomit persever he wa unabl
to maintain the struggl to gain a livelihood as a dramatist for more
than three year nor wa the rise popular of lope the caus as
is often said notwithstand hi own word to the contrari when lope
began to write for the stage is uncertain but it wa certainli after
cervant went to sevil
among the nuevo documento print by seor asensio y toledo is on
date 1592 and curious characterist of cervant it is an
agreement with on rodrigo osorio a manag who wa to accept six
comedi at fifti ducat about 6l apiec not to be paid in ani case
unless it appear on represent that the said comedi wa on of
the best that had ever been repres in spain the test doe not
seem to have been ever appli perhap it wa suffici appar to
rodrigo osorio that the comedi were not among the best that had ever
been repres among the correspond of cervant there might
have been found no doubt more than on letter like that we see in the
rake progress sir i have read your plai and it will not doo
he wa more success in a literari contest at saragossa in 1595 in
honour of the canonis of st jacinto when hi composit won the
first prize three silver spoon the year befor thi he had been
appoint a collector of revenu for the kingdom of granada in order
to remit the monei he had collect more conveni to the treasuri
he entrust it to a merchant who fail and abscond and as the
bankrupt asset were insuffici to cover the whole he wa sent to
prison at sevil in septemb 1597 the balanc against him howev
wa a small on about 26l and on give secur for it he wa
releas at the end of the year
it wa as he journei from town to town collect the king tax
that he note down those bit of inn and waysid life and charact
that abound in the page of don quixot the benedictin monk with
spectacl and sunshad mount on their tall mule the stroller in
costum bound for the next villag the barber with hi basin on hi
head on hi wai to bleed a patient the recruit with hi breech in
hi bundl tramp along the road sing the reaper gather in
the venta gatewai listen to felixmart of hircania read out to
them and those littl hogarthian touch that he so well knew how to
bring in the oxtail hang up with the landlord comb stuck in it
the wineskin at the bedhead and those notabl exampl of hostelri
art helen go off in high spirit on pariss arm and dido on the
tower drop tear as big as walnut nai it mai well be that on
those journei into remot region he came across now and then a
specimen of the pauper gentleman with hi lean hack and hi greyhound
and hi book of chivalri dream awai hi life in happi ignor
that the world had chang sinc hi greatgrandfath old helmet wa
new but it wa in sevil that he found out hi true vocat though
he himself would not by ani mean have admit it to be so it wa
there in triana that he wa first tempt to try hi hand at draw
from life and first brought hi humour into plai in the exquisit
littl sketch of rinconet y cortadillo the germ in more wai than
on of don quixot
where and when that wa written we cannot tell after hi imprison
all trace of cervant in hi offici capac disappear from which
it mai be infer that he wa not reinstat that he wa still in
sevil in novemb 1598 appear from a satir sonnet of hi on the
elabor catafalqu erect to testifi the grief of the citi at the
death of philip ii but from thi up to 1603 we have no clue to hi
movement the word in the prefac to the first part of don quixot
ar gener held to be conclus that he conceiv the idea of the
book and wrote the begin of it at least in a prison and that he
mai have done so is extrem like
there is a tradit that cervant read some portion of hi work to a
select audienc at the duke of bejar which mai have help to make
the book known but the obviou conclus is that the first part of
don quixot lai on hi hand some time befor he could find a
publish bold enough to undertak a ventur of so novel a charact
and so littl faith in it had francisco robl of madrid to whom at
last he sold it that he did not care to incur the expens of secur
the copyright for aragon or portug content himself with that for
castil the print wa finish in decemb and the book came out
with the new year 1605 it is often said that don quixot wa at
first receiv coldli the fact show just the contrari no sooner wa
it in the hand of the public than prepar were made to issu
pirat edit at lisbon and valencia and to bring out a second
edit with the addit copyright for aragon and portug which
he secur in februari
no doubt it wa receiv with someth more than cold by certain
section of the commun men of wit tast and discrimin among
the aristocraci gave it a hearti welcom but the aristocraci in
gener were not like to relish a book that turn their favourit
read into ridicul and laugh at so mani of their favourit idea
the dramatist who gather round lope as their leader regard
cervant as their common enemi and it is plain that he wa equal
obnoxi to the other cliqu the culto poet who had gongora for
their chief navarret who knew noth of the letter abov mention
tri hard to show that the relat between cervant and lope were
of a veri friendli sort as inde thei were until don quixot wa
written cervant inde to the last gener and manfulli
declar hi admir of lope power hi unfail invent and
hi marvel fertil but in the prefac of the first part of don
quixot and in the vers of urganda the unknown and on or two
other place there ar if we read between the line sly hit at
lope vaniti and affect that argu no person goodwil and
lope openli sneer at don quixot and cervant and fourteen year
after hi death give him onli a few line of cold commonplac in the
laurel de apolo that seem all the colder for the eulogi of a host
of nonent whose name ar found nowher els
in 1601 valladolid wa made the seat of the court and at the begin
of 1603 cervant had been summon thither in connect with the
balanc due by him to the treasuri which wa still outstand he
remain at valladolid appar support himself by agenc and
scriven work of some sort probabl draft petit and draw
up statement of claim to be present to the council and the like
so at least we gather from the deposit taken on the occas of
the death of a gentleman the victim of a street brawl who had been
carri into the hous in which he live in these he himself is
describ as a man who wrote and transact busi and it appear
that hi household then consist of hi wife the natur daughter
isabel de saavedra alreadi mention hi sister andrea now a widow
her daughter constanza a mysteri magdalena de sotomayor call
herself hi sister for whom hi biograph cannot account and a
servantmaid
meanwhil don quixot had been grow in favour and it author
name wa now known beyond the pyrene in 1607 an edit wa print
at brussel robl the madrid publish found it necessari to meet
the demand by a third edit the seventh in all in 1608 the
popular of the book in itali wa such that a milan booksel wa
led to bring out an edit in 1610 and anoth wa call for in
brussel in 1611 it might natur have been expect that with such
proof befor him that he had hit the tast of the public cervant
would have at onc set about redeem hi rather vagu promis of a
second volum
but to all appear noth wa farther from hi thought he had
still by him on or two short tale of the same vintag as those he had
insert in don quixot and instead of continu the adventur of
don quixot he set to work to write more of these novela exemplar
as he afterward call them with a view to make a book of them
the novel were publish in the summer of 1613 with a dedic to
the cond de lemo the maecena of the dai and with on of those
chatti confidenti prefac cervant wa so fond of in thi eight
year and a half after the first part of don quixot had appear we
get the first hint of a forthcom second part you shall see
shortli he sai the further exploit of don quixot and humour of
sancho panza hi idea of shortli wa a somewhat elast on for
as we know by the date to sancho letter he had bare onehalf of
the book complet that time twelvemonth
but more than poem or pastor or novel it wa hi dramat
ambit that engross hi thought the same indomit spirit that
kept him from despair in the bagnio of algier and prompt him to
attempt the escap of himself and hi comrad again and again made
him persever in spite of failur and discourag in hi effort to
win the ear of the public as a dramatist the tempera of cervant
wa essenti sanguin the portrait he draw in the prefac to the
novel with the aquilin featur chestnut hair smooth untroubl
forehead and bright cheer ey is the veri portrait of a sanguin
man noth that the manag might sai could persuad him that the
merit of hi plai would not be recognis at last if thei were onli
given a fair chanc the old soldier of the spanish salami wa bent on
be the aeschylu of spain he wa to found a great nation drama
base on the true principl of art that wa to be the envi of all
nation he wa to drive from the stage the silli childish plai the
mirror of nonsens and model of folli that were in vogu through
the cupid of the manag and shortsighted of the author he
wa to correct and educ the public tast until it wa ripe for
tragedi on the model of the greek dramalik the numancia for
instanceand comedi that would not onli amus but improv and
instruct all thi he wa to do could he onc get a hear there wa
the initi difficulti
he show plainli enough too that don quixot and the demolit of
the chivalri romanc wa not the work that lai next hi heart he wa
inde as he sai himself in hi prefac more a stepfath than a
father to don quixot never wa great work so neglect by it
author that it wa written carelessli hastili and by fit and
start wa not alwai hi fault but it seem clear he never read what
he sent to the press he knew how the printer had blunder but he
never took the troubl to correct them when the third edit wa in
progress as a man who realli care for the child of hi brain would
have done he appear to have regard the book as littl more than a
mere libro de entretenimiento an amus book a thing as he sai in
the viaj to divert the melancholi moodi heart at ani time or
season no doubt he had an affect for hi hero and wa veri proud
of sancho panza it would have been strang inde if he had not been
proud of the most humor creation in all fiction he wa proud too
of the popular and success of the book and beyond measur
delight is the naivet with which he show hi pride in a dozen
passag in the second part but it wa not the success he covet in
all probabl he would have given all the success of don quixot
nai would have seen everi copi of don quixot burn in the plaza
mayor for on such success as lope de vega wa enjoi on an averag
onc a week
and so he went on dawdl over don quixot ad a chapter now
and again and put it asid to turn to persil and
sigismundawhich as we know wa to be the most entertain book in
the languag and the rival of theagen and charicleaor finish
off on of hi darl comedi and if robl ask when don quixot
would be readi the answer no doubt wa en breveshortli there wa
time enough for that at sixtyeight he wa as full of life and hope
and plan for the futur as a boi of eighteen
nemesi wa come howev he had got as far as chapter lix which at
hi leisur pace he could hardli have reach befor octob or
novemb 1614 when there wa put into hi hand a small octav late
print at tarragona and call itself second volum of the
ingeni gentleman don quixot of la mancha by the licenti alonso
fernandez de avellaneda of tordesilla the last half of chapter lix
and most of the follow chapter of the second part give us some idea
of the effect produc upon him and hi irrit wa not like to
be lessen by the reflect that he had no on to blame but himself
had avellaneda in fact been content with mere bring out a
continu to don quixot cervant would have had no reason
grievanc hi own intent were express in the veri vaguest
languag at the end of the book nai in hi last word fors altro
cantera con miglior plettro he seem actual to invit someon els
to continu the work and he made no sign until eight year and a half
had gone by by which time avellaneda volum wa no doubt written
in fact cervant had no case or a veri bad on as far as the mere
continu wa concern but avellaneda chose to write a prefac to
it full of such coars person abus as onli an illcondit man
could pour out he taunt cervant with be old with have lost
hi hand with have been in prison with be poor with be
friendless accus him of envi of lope success of petul and
querul and so on and it wa in thi that the sting lai
avellaneda reason for thi person attack is obviou enough whoever
he mai have been it is clear that he wa on of the dramatist of
lope school for he ha the impud to charg cervant with
attack him as well as lope in hi critic on the drama hi
identif ha exercis the best critic and baffl all the
ingenu and research that ha been brought to bear on it navarret
and ticknor both inclin to the belief that cervant knew who he wa
but i must sai i think the anger he show suggest an invis
assail it is like the irrit of a man stung by a mosquito in
the dark cervant from certain solec of languag pronounc him
to be an aragones and pellic an aragones himself support thi
view and believ him moreov to have been an ecclesiast a
dominican probabl
ani merit avellaneda ha is reflect from cervant and he is too
dull to reflect much dull and dirti will alwai be i imagin the
verdict of the vast major of unprejud reader he is at best a
poor plagiarist all he can do is to follow slavishli the lead given
him by cervant hi onli humour li in make don quixot take inn
for castl and fanci himself some legendari or histor personag
and sancho mistak word invert proverb and displai hi gluttoni
all through he show a procliv to coars and dirt and he ha
contriv to introduc two tale filthier than anyth by the
sixteenth centuri novellieri and without their sprightli
but whatev avellaneda and hi book mai be we must not forget the
debt we ow them but for them there can be no doubt don quixot
would have come to us a mere torso instead of a complet work even if
cervant had finish the volum he had in hand most assuredli he
would have left off with a promis of a third part give the further
adventur of don quixot and humour of sancho panza as shepherd it
is plain that he had at on time an intent of deal with the
pastor romanc as he had dealt with the book of chivalri and but
for avellaneda he would have tri to carri it out but it is more
like that with hi plan and project and hope the volum
would have remain unfinish till hi death and that we should have
never made the acquaint of the duke and duchess or gone with
sancho to barataria
from the moment the book came into hi hand he seem to have been
haunt by the fear that there might be more avellaneda in the field
and put everyth els asid he set himself to finish off hi
task and protect don quixot in the onli wai he could by kill him
the conclus is no doubt a hasti and in some place clumsi piec of
work and the frequent repetit of the scold administ to
avellaneda becom in the end rather wearisom but it is at ani rate
a conclus and for that we must thank avellaneda
the new volum wa readi for the press in februari but wa not print
till the veri end of 1615 and dure the interv cervant put
togeth the comedi and interlud he had written within the last few
year and as he add plaintiv found no demand for among the
manag and publish them with a prefac worth the book it
introduc tenfold in which he give an account of the earli spanish
stage and of hi own attempt as a dramatist it is needless to sai
thei were put forward by cervant in all good faith and full
confid in their merit the reader howev wa not to suppos
thei were hi last word or final effort in the drama for he had in
hand a comedi call engano a lo ojo about which if he mistook
not there would be no question
of thi dramat masterpiec the world ha no opportun of judg
hi health had been fail for some time and he di appar of
dropsi on the 23rd of april 1616 the dai on which england lost
shakespear nomin at least for the english calendar had not yet
been reform he di as he had live accept hi lot brave and
cheerfulli
wa it an unhappi life that of cervant hi biograph all tell us
that it wa but i must sai i doubt it it wa a hard life a life of
poverti of incess struggl of toil ill paid of disappoint
but cervant carri within himself the antidot to all these evil
hi wa not on of those light natur that rise abov advers mere
by virtu of their own buoyanc it wa in the fortitud of a high
spirit that he wa proof against it it is imposs to conceiv
cervant give wai to despond or prostrat by deject as for
poverti it wa with him a thing to be laugh over and the onli sigh
he ever allow to escap him is when he sai happi he to whom heaven
ha given a piec of bread for which he is not bound to give thank to
ani but heaven itself add to all thi hi vital energi and mental
activ hi restless invent and hi sanguin tempera and
there will be reason enough to doubt whether hi could have been a veri
unhappi life he who could take cervant distress togeth with hi
apparatu for endur them would not make so bad a bargain perhap
as far as happi in life is concern
of hi burialplac noth is known except that he wa buri in
accord with hi will in the neighbour convent of trinitarian
nun of which it is suppos hi daughter isabel de saavedra wa an
inmat and that a few year afterward the nun remov to anoth
convent carri their dead with them but whether the remain of
cervant were includ in the remov or not no on know and the
clue to their restingplac is now lost beyond all hope thi furnish
perhap the least defens of the item in the charg of neglect
brought against hi contemporari in some of the other there is a
good deal of exagger to listen to most of hi biograph on
would suppos that all spain wa in leagu not onli against the man but
against hi memori or at least that it wa insens to hi merit
and left him to live in miseri and die of want to talk of hi hard
life and unworthi employ in andalusia is absurd what had he done
to distinguish him from thousand of other struggl men earn a
precari livelihood true he wa a gallant soldier who had been
wound and had undergon captiv and suffer in hi countri
caus but there were hundr of other in the same case he had
written a mediocr specimen of an insipid class of romanc and some
plai which manifestli did not compli with the primari condit of
pleas were the playgoer to patronis plai that did not amus
them becaus the author wa to produc don quixot twenti year
afterward
the scrambl for copi which as we have seen follow immedi on
the appear of the book doe not look like gener insens to
it merit no doubt it wa receiv coldli by some but if a man
write a book in ridicul of periwig he must make hi account with
be coldli receiv by the periwig wearer and hate by the whole
tribe of wigmak if cervant had the chivalryrom reader the
sentimentalist the dramatist and the poet of the period all
against him it wa becaus don quixot wa what it wa and if the
gener public did not come forward to make him comfort for the
rest of hi dai it is no more to be charg with neglect and
ingratitud than the englishspeak public that did not pai off
scott liabil it did the best it could it read hi book and
like it and bought it and encourag the booksel to pai him well
for other
it ha been also made a reproach to spain that she ha erect no
monument to the man she is proudest of no monument that is to sai of
him for the bronz statu in the littl garden of the plaza de la
cort a fair work of art no doubt and unexception had it been
set up to the local poet in the marketplac of some provinci town
is not worthi of cervant or of madrid but what need ha cervant of
such weak wit of hi name or what could a monument do in hi
case except testifi to the selfglorif of those who had put it
up si monumentum quoeri circumspic the nearest booksel shop
will show what batho there would be in a monument to the author of
don quixot
don quixot
nine edit of the first part of don quixot had alreadi appear
befor cervant di thirti thousand copi in all accord to hi
own estim and a tenth wa print at barcelona the year after hi
death so larg a number natur suppli the demand for some time
but by 1634 it appear to have been exhaust and from that time down
to the present dai the stream of edit ha continu to flow rapidli
and regularli the translat show still more clearli in what request
the book ha been from the veri outset in seven year from the
complet of the work it had been translat into the four lead
languag of europ except the bibl in fact no book ha been so
wide diffus as don quixot the imitatio christi mai have been
translat into as mani differ languag and perhap robinson
cruso and the vicar of wakefield into nearli as mani but in
multipl of translat and edit don quixot leav them all
far behind
still more remark is the charact of thi wide diffus don
quixot ha been thoroughli naturalis among peopl whose idea about
knighterrantri if thei had ani at all were of the vaguest who had
never seen or heard of a book of chivalri who could not possibl feel
the humour of the burlesqu or sympathis with the author purpos
anoth curiou fact is that thi the most cosmopolitan book in the
world is on of the most intens nation manon lescaut is not
more thoroughli french tom jone not more english rob roi not
more scotch than don quixot is spanish in charact in idea in
sentiment in local colour in everyth what then is the secret of
thi unparallel popular increas year by year for wellnigh
three centuri on explan no doubt is that of all the book in
the world don quixot is the most cathol there is someth in it
for everi sort of reader young or old sage or simpl high or low as
cervant himself sai with a touch of pride it is thumb and read
and got by heart by peopl of all sort the children turn it leav
the young peopl read it the grown men understand it the old folk
prais it
but it would be idl to deni that the ingredi which more than it
humour or it wisdom or the fertil of invent or knowledg of
human natur it displai ha insur it success with the multitud
is the vein of farc that run through it it wa the attack upon the
sheep the battl with the wineskin mambrino helmet the balsam of
fierabra don quixot knock over by the sail of the windmil
sancho toss in the blanket the mishap and misadventur of master
and man that were origin the great attract and perhap ar so
still to some extent with the major of reader it is plain that
don quixot wa gener regard at first and inde in spain for
a long time as littl more than a queer droll book full of laughabl
incid and absurd situat veri amus but not entitl to much
consider or care all the edit print in spain from 1637 to
1771 when the famou printer ibarra took it up were mere trade
edit badli and carelessli print on vile paper and got up in the
style of chapbook intend onli for popular us with in most
instanc uncouth illustr and claptrap addit by the
publish
to england belong the credit of have been the first countri to
recognis the right of don quixot to better treatment than thi the
london edit of 1738 commonli call lord carteret from have
been suggest by him wa not a mere dition de lux it produc
don quixot in becom form as regard paper and type and
embellish with plate which if not particularli happi as
illustr were at least well intent and well execut but it
also aim at correct of text a matter to which nobodi except the
editor of the valencia and brussel edit had given even a pass
thought and for a first attempt it wa fairli success for though
some of it emend ar inadmiss a good mani of them have been
adopt by all subsequ editor
the zeal of publish editor and annot brought about a
remark chang of sentiment with regard to don quixot a vast
number of it admir began to grow asham of laugh over it it
becam almost a crime to treat it as a humor book the humour wa
not entir deni but accord to the new view it wa rate as an
altogeth secondari qualiti a mere accessori noth more than the
stalkinghors under the present of which cervant shot hi
philosophi or hi satir or whatev it wa he meant to shoot for on
thi point opinion vari all were agre howev that the object
he aim at wa not the book of chivalri he said emphat in the
prefac to the first part and in the last sentenc of the second that
he had no other object in view than to discredit these book and thi
to advanc critic made it clear that hi object must have been
someth els
on theori wa that the book wa a kind of allegori set forth the
etern struggl between the ideal and the real between the spirit of
poetri and the spirit of prose and perhap german philosophi never
evolv a more ungainli or unlik camel out of the depth of it
inner conscious someth of the antagon no doubt is to be
found in don quixot becaus it is to be found everywher in life
and cervant drew from life it is difficult to imagin a commun in
which the neverceas game of crosspurpos between sancho panza and
don quixot would not be recognis as true to natur in the stone
ag among the lake dweller among the cave men there were don
quixot and sancho panza there must have been the troglodyt who
never could see the fact befor hi ey and the troglodyt who could
see noth els but to suppos cervant deliber set himself
to expound ani such idea in two stout quarto volum is to suppos
someth not onli veri unlik the ag in which he live but
altogeth unlik cervant himself who would have been the first to
laugh at an attempt of the sort made by anyon els
the extraordinari influenc of the romanc of chivalri in hi dai is
quit enough to account for the genesi of the book some idea of the
prodigi develop of thi branch of literatur in the sixteenth
centuri mai be obtain from the scrutini of chapter vii if the reader
bear in mind that onli a portion of the romanc belong to by far
the largest group ar enumer as to it effect upon the nation
there is abund evid from the time when the amadis and
palmerin began to grow popular down to the veri end of the centuri
there is a steadi stream of invect from men whose charact and
posit lend weight to their word against the romanc of chivalri
and the infatu of their reader ridicul wa the onli besom to
sweep awai that dust
that thi wa the task cervant set himself and that he had ampl
provoc to urg him to it will be suffici clear to those who
look into the evid as it will be also that it wa not chivalri
itself that he attack and swept awai of all the absurd that
thank to poetri will be repeat to the end of time there is no
greater on than sai that cervant smile spain chivalri awai
in the first place there wa no chivalri for him to smile awai spain
chivalri had been dead for more than a centuri it work wa done when
granada fell and as chivalri wa essenti republican in it natur
it could not live under the rule that ferdinand substitut for the
free institut of mediaev spain what he did smile awai wa not
chivalri but a degrad mockeri of it
the true natur of the right arm and the bright arrai befor
which accord to the poet the world gave ground and which
cervant singl laugh demolish mai be gather from the word of
on of hi own countrymen don felix pacheco as report by captain
georg carleton in hi militari memoir from 1672 to 1713 befor
the appear in the world of that labour of cervant he said it
wa next to an imposs for a man to walk the street with ani
delight or without danger there were seen so mani cavali pranc
and curvet befor the window of their mistress that a stranger
would have imagin the whole nation to have been noth less than a
race of knighterr but after the world becam a littl acquaint
with that notabl histori the man that wa seen in that onc
celebr draperi wa point at as a don quixot and found himself
the jest of high and low and i verili believ that to thi and thi
onli we ow that damp and poverti of spirit which ha run through
all our council for a centuri past so littl agreeabl to those
nobler action of our famou ancestor
to call don quixot a sad book preach a pessimist view of life
argu a total misconcept of it drift it would be so if it moral
were that in thi world true enthusiasm natur lead to ridicul
and discomfitur but it preach noth of the sort it moral so
far as it can be said to have on is that the spuriou enthusiasm that
is born of vaniti and selfconceit that is made an end in itself not
a mean to an end that act on mere impuls regardless of
circumst and consequ is mischiev to it owner and a veri
consider nuisanc to the commun at larg to those who cannot
distinguish between the on kind and the other no doubt don quixot
is a sad book no doubt to some mind it is veri sad that a man who had
just utter so beauti a sentiment as that it is a hard case to
make slave of those whom god and natur made free should be
ungratefulli pelt by the scoundrel hi crazi philanthropi had let
loos on societi but to other of a more judici cast it will be a
matter of regret that reckless selfsuffici enthusiasm is not
often requit in some such wai for all the mischief it doe in the
world
a veri slight examin of the structur of don quixot will
suffic to show that cervant had no deep design or elabor plan in
hi mind when he began the book when he wrote those line in which
with a few stroke of a great master he set befor us the pauper
gentleman he had no idea of the goal to which hi imagin wa
lead him there can be littl doubt that all he contempl wa a
short tale to rang with those he had alreadi written a tale set
forth the ludicr result that might be expect to follow the
attempt of a crazi gentleman to act the part of a knighterr in
modern life
it is plain for on thing that sancho panza did not enter into the
origin scheme for had cervant thought of him he certainli would
not have omit him in hi hero outfit which he obvious meant to
be complet him we ow to the landlord chanc remark in chapter iii
that knight seldom travel without squir to try to think of a don
quixot without sancho panza is like try to think of a oneblad
pair of scissor
the stori wa written at first like the other without ani divis
and without the intervent of cid hamet beneng and it seem not
unlik that cervant had some intent of bring dulcinea or
aldonza lorenzo on the scene in person it wa probabl the ransack
of the don librari and the discuss on the book of chivalri that
first suggest it to him that hi idea wa capabl of develop
what if instead of a mere string of farcic misadventur he were to
make hi tale a burlesqu of on of these book caricatur their
style incid and spirit
in pursuanc of thi chang of plan he hastili and somewhat clumsili
divid what he had written into chapter on the model of amadi
invent the fabl of a mysteri arab manuscript and set up cid
hamet beneng in imit of the almost invari practic of the
chivalryrom author who were fond of trace their book to some
recondit sourc in work out the new idea he soon found the valu
of sancho panza inde the keynot not onli to sancho part but to
the whole book is struck in the first word sancho utter when he
announc hi intent of take hi ass with him about the ass we
ar told don quixot hesit a littl try whether he could call
to mind ani knighterr take with him an esquir mount on
assback but no instanc occur to hi memori we can see the whole
scene at a glanc the stolid unconsci of sancho and the
perplex of hi master upon whose percept the incongru ha
just forc itself thi is sancho mission throughout the book he is
an unconsci mephistophel alwai unwittingli make mockeri of hi
master aspir alwai expos the fallaci of hi idea by some
unintent ad absurdum alwai bring him back to the world of
fact and commonplac by forc of sheer stolid
by the time cervant had got hi volum of novel off hi hand and
summon up resolut enough to set about the second part in earnest
the case wa veri much alter don quixot and sancho panza had not
mere found favour but had alreadi becom what thei have never sinc
ceas to be verit entiti to the popular imagin there wa
no occas for him now to interpol extran matter nai hi
reader told him plainli that what thei want of him wa more don
quixot and more sancho panza and not novel tale or digress
to himself too hi creation had becom realiti and he had becom
proud of them especi of sancho he began the second part
therefor under veri differ condit and the differ make
itself manifest at onc even in translat the style will be seen to
be far easier more flow more natur and more like that of a man
sure of himself and of hi audienc don quixot and sancho undergo a
chang also in the first part don quixot ha no charact or
individu whatev he is noth more than a crazi repres
of the sentiment of the chivalri romanc in all that he sai and
doe he is simpli repeat the lesson he ha learn from hi book
and therefor it is absurd to speak of him in the gush strain of
the sentiment critic when thei dilat upon hi nobl
disinterested dauntless courag and so forth it wa the busi
of a knighterr to right wrong redress injuri and succour the
distress and thi as a matter of cours he make hi busi when
he take up the part a knighterr wa bound to be intrepid and so
he feel bound to cast fear asid of all byron melodi nonsens
about don quixot the most nonsens statement is that ti hi
virtu make him mad the exact opposit is the truth it is hi
mad make him virtuou
in the second part cervant repeatedli remind the reader as if it
wa a point upon which he wa anxiou there should be no mistak that
hi hero mad is strictli confin to delus on the subject of
chivalri and that on everi other subject he is discreto on in fact
whose faculti of discern is in perfect order the advantag of thi
is that he is enabl to make us of don quixot as a mouthpiec for
hi own reflect and so without seem to digress allow himself
the relief of digress when he requir it as freeli as in a
commonplac book
it is true the amount of individu bestow upon don quixot is not
veri great there ar some natur touch of charact about him such
as hi mixtur of irasc and placabl and hi curiou
affect for sancho togeth with hi impati of the squir
loquac and impertin but in the main apart from hi craze he
is littl more than a thought cultur gentleman with instinct
good tast and a great deal of shrewd and origin of mind
as to sancho it is plain from the conclud word of the prefac to
the first part that he wa a favourit with hi creator even befor he
had been taken into favour by the public an inferior geniu take
him in hand a second time would veri like have tri to improv him
by make him more comic clever amiabl or virtuou but cervant
wa too true an artist to spoil hi work in thi wai sancho when he
reappear is the old sancho with the old familiar featur but with a
differ thei have been brought out more distinctli but at the same
time with a care avoid of anyth like caricatur the outlin
ha been fill in where fill in wa necessari and vivifi by a
few touch of a master hand sancho stand befor us as he might in
a charact portrait by velazquez he is a much more import and
promin figur in the second part than in the first inde it is
hi matchless mendac about dulcinea that to a great extent suppli
the action of the stori
hi develop in thi respect is as remark as in ani other in
the first part he displai a great natur gift of ly hi li ar
not of the highli imagin sort that liar in fiction commonli
indulg in like falstaff thei resembl the father that beget them
thei ar simpl home plump li plain work li in short but
in the servic of such a master as don quixot he develop rapidli as
we see when he come to palm off the three countri wench as dulcinea
and her ladi in wait it is worth notic how flush by hi
success in thi instanc he is tempt afterward to try a flight
beyond hi power in hi account of the journei on clavileo
in the second part it is the spirit rather than the incid of the
chivalri romanc that is the subject of the burlesqu enchant of
the sort travesti in those of dulcinea and the trifaldi and the cave
of montesino plai a lead part in the later and inferior romanc
and anoth distinguish featur is caricatur in don quixot
blind ador of dulcinea in the romanc of chivalri love is either
a mere anim or a fantast idolatri onli a coarsemind man
would care to make merri with the former but to on of cervant
humour the latter wa natur an attract subject for ridicul
like everyth els in these romanc it is a gross exagger of
the real sentiment of chivalri but it peculiar extravag is
probabl due to the influenc of those master of hyperbol the
provenc poet when a troubadour profess hi readi to obei hi
ladi in all thing he made it incumb upon the next comer if he
wish to avoid the imput of tame and commonplac to declar
himself the slave of her will which the next wa compel to cap by
some still stronger declar and so express of devot went on
rise on abov the other like bid at an auction and a
convent languag of gallantri and theori of love came into be
that in time permeat the literatur of southern europ and bore
fruit in on direct in the transcendent worship of beatric and
laura and in anoth in the grotesqu idolatri which found expon
in writer like feliciano de silva thi is what cervant deal with
in don quixot passion for dulcinea and in no instanc ha he
carri out the burlesqu more happili by keep dulcinea in the
background and make her a vagu shadowi be of whose veri
exist we ar left in doubt he invest don quixot worship of her
virtu and charm with an addit extravag and give still
more point to the caricatur of the sentiment and languag of the
romanc
on of the great merit of don quixot and on of the qualiti that
have secur it accept by all class of reader and made it the
most cosmopolitan of book is it simplic there ar of cours
point obviou enough to a spanish seventeenth centuri audienc which
do not immedi strike a reader nowadai and cervant often
take it for grant that an allus will be gener understood
which is onli intellig to a few for exampl on mani of hi
reader in spain and most of hi reader out of it the signific
of hi choic of a countri for hi hero is complet lost it would be
go too far to sai that no on can thoroughli comprehend don
quixot without have seen la mancha but undoubtedli even a glimps
of la mancha will give an insight into the mean of cervant such as
no comment can give of all the region of spain it is the last
that would suggest the idea of romanc of all the dull central plateau
of the peninsula it is the dullest tract there is someth impress
about the grim solitud of estremadura and if the plain of leon and
old castil ar bald and dreari thei ar stud with old citi
renown in histori and rich in relic of the past but there is no
redeem featur in the manchegan landscap it ha all the same
of the desert without it digniti the few town and villag that
break it monotoni ar mean and commonplac there is noth vener
about them thei have not even the picturesqu of poverti inde
don quixot own villag argamasilla ha a sort of oppress
respect in the prim regular of it street and hous
everyth is ignobl the veri windmil ar the ugliest and shabbiest
of the windmil kind
to anyon who knew the countri well the mere style and titl of don
quixot of la mancha gave the kei to the author mean at onc la
mancha as the knight countri and scene of hi chivalri is of a
piec with the pasteboard helmet the farmlabour on assback for a
squir knighthood confer by a rascal ventero convict taken for
victim of oppress and the rest of the incongru between don
quixot world and the world he live in between thing as he saw
them and thing as thei were
it is strang that thi element of incongru underli the whole
humour and purpos of the book should have been so littl heed by
the major of those who have undertaken to interpret don quixot
it ha been complet overlook for exampl by the illustr to
be sure the great major of the artist who illustr don
quixot knew noth whatev of spain to them a venta convei no
idea but the abstract on of a roadsid inn and thei could not
therefor do full justic to the humour of don quixot misconcept
in take it for a castl or perceiv the remot of all it
realiti from hi ideal but even when better inform thei seem to
have no apprehens of the full forc of the discrep take for
instanc gustav dor draw of don quixot watch hi armour in
the innyard whether or not the venta de quesada on the sevil road
is as tradit maintain the inn describ in don quixot beyond
all question it wa just such an innyard as the on behind it that
cervant had in hi mind ey and it wa on just such a rude stone
trough as that besid the primit drawwel in the corner that he
meant don quixot to deposit hi armour gustav dor make it an
elabor fountain such as no arriero ever water hi mule at in the
corral of ani venta in spain and therebi entir miss the point
aim at by cervant it is the mean prosaic commonplac charact
of all the surround and circumst that give a signific to
don quixot vigil and the ceremoni that follow
cervant humour is for the most part of that broader and simpler
sort the strength of which li in the percept of the incongru
it is the incongru of sancho in all hi wai word and work with
the idea and aim of hi master quit as much as the wonder
vital and truth to natur of the charact that make him the most
humor creation in the whole rang of fiction that unsmil graviti
of which cervant wa the first great master cervant seriou
air which sit natur on swift alon perhap of later
humourist is essenti to thi kind of humour and here again
cervant ha suffer at the hand of hi interpret noth
unless inde the coars buffooneri of phillip could be more out of
place in an attempt to repres cervant than a flippant wouldb
faceti style like that of motteux version for exampl or the
sprightli jaunti air french translat sometim adopt it is the
grave matteroffact of the narr and the appar
unconsci of the author that he is sai anyth ludicr
anyth but the merest commonplac that give it peculiar flavour to
the humour of cervant hi in fact is the exact opposit of the
humour of stern and the selfconsci humourist even when uncl
tobi is at hi best you ar alwai awar of the man stern behind
him watch you over hi shoulder to see what effect he is produc
cervant alwai leav you alon with don quixot and sancho he and
swift and the great humourist alwai keep themselv out of sight or
more properli speak never think about themselv at all unlik our
latterdai school of humourist who seem to have reviv the old
horsecollar method and try to rais a laugh by some grotesqu
assumpt of ignor imbecil or bad tast
it is true that to do full justic to spanish humour in ani other
languag is wellnigh an imposs there is a natur graviti and
a sonor stateli about spanish be it ever so colloqui that
make an absurd doubli absurd and give plausibl to the most
preposter statement thi is what make sancho panza drolleri the
despair of the conscienti translat sancho curt comment can
never fall flat but thei lose half their flavour when transfer from
their nativ castilian into ani other medium but if foreign have
fail to do justic to the humour of cervant thei ar no wors than
hi own countrymen inde were it not for the spanish peasant
relish of don quixot on might be tempt to think that the great
humourist wa not look upon as a humourist at all in hi own countri
the craze of don quixot seem in some instanc to have commun
itself to hi critic make them see thing that ar not in the book
and run full tilt at phantom that have no exist save in their own
imagin like a good mani critic nowadai thei forget that
scream ar not critic and that it is onli vulgar tast that ar
influenc by string of superl threepil hyperbol and
pompou epithet but what strike on as particularli strang is that
while thei deal in extravag eulogi and ascrib all manner of
imaginari idea and qualiti to cervant thei show no percept of
the qualiti that ninetynin out of a hundr of hi reader would rate
highest in him and hold to be the on that rais him abov all
rivalri
to speak of don quixot as if it were mere a humor book would be
a manifest misdescript cervant at time make it a kind of
commonplac book for occasion essai and critic or for the
observ and reflect and gather wisdom of a long and stir
life it is a mine of shrewd observ on mankind and human natur
among modern novel there mai be here and there more elabor
studi of charact but there is no book richer in individualis
charact what coleridg said of shakespear in minimi is true of
cervant he never even for the most temporari purpos put forward
a lai figur there is life and individu in all hi charact
howev littl thei mai have to do or howev short a time thei mai be
befor the reader samson carrasco the curat teresa panza
altisidora even the two student met on the road to the cave of
montesino all live and move and have their be and it is
characterist of the broad human of cervant that there is not a
hate on among them all even poor maritorn with her deplor
moral ha a kind heart of her own and some faint and distant
resembl to a christian about her and as for sancho though on
dissect we fail to find a lovabl trait in him unless it be a sort
of doglik affect for hi master who is there that in hi heart
doe not love him
but it is after all the humour of don quixot that distinguish it
from all other book of the romanc kind it is thi that make it as
on of the most judicialmind of modern critic call it the best
novel in the world beyond all comparison it is it vari humour
rang from broad farc to comedi as subtl as shakespear or
molir that ha naturalis it in everi countri where there ar
reader and made it a classic in everi languag that ha a literatur
the author prefac
idl reader thou mayest believ me without ani oath that i would thi
book as it is the child of my brain were the fairest gayest and
cleverest that could be imagin but i could not counteract natur
law that everyth shall beget it like and what then could thi
steril illtil wit of mine beget but the stori of a dry
shrivel whimsic offspr full of thought of all sort and such
as never came into ani other imaginationjust what might be begotten in
a prison where everi miseri is lodg and everi dole sound make
it dwell tranquil a cheer retreat pleasant field bright
ski murmur brook peac of mind these ar the thing that go
far to make even the most barren muse fertil and bring into the
world birth that fill it with wonder and delight sometim when a
father ha an ugli loutish son the love he bear him so blindfold
hi ey that he doe not see hi defect or rather take them for
gift and charm of mind and bodi and talk of them to hi friend as
wit and grace i howeverfor though i pass for the father i am but
the stepfath to don quixotehav no desir to go with the current
of custom or to implor thee dearest reader almost with tear in my
ey as other do to pardon or excus the defect thou wilt perceiv
in thi child of mine thou art neither it kinsman nor it friend thy
soul is thine own and thy will as free as ani man whateer he be
thou art in thine own hous and master of it as much as the king of hi
tax and thou knowest the common sai under my cloak i kill the
king all which exempt and free thee from everi consider and
oblig and thou canst sai what thou wilt of the stori without fear
of be abus for ani ill or reward for ani good thou mayest sai of
it
my wish would be simpli to present it to thee plain and unadorn
without ani embellish of prefac or uncount muster of customari
sonnet epigram and eulogi such as ar commonli put at the
begin of book for i can tell thee though compos it cost me
some labour i found none greater than the make of thi prefac thou
art now read mani time did i take up my pen to write it and mani
did i lai it down again not know what to write on of these time
as i wa ponder with the paper befor me a pen in my ear my elbow
on the desk and my cheek in my hand think of what i should sai
there came in unexpectedli a certain live clever friend of mine
who see me so deep in thought ask the reason to which i make
no mysteri of it answer that i wa think of the prefac i had to
make for the stori of don quixot which so troubl me that i had a
mind not to make ani at all nor even publish the achiev of so
nobl a knight
for how could you expect me not to feel uneasi about what that
ancient lawgiv thei call the public will sai when it see me after
slumber so mani year in the silenc of oblivion come out now
with all my year upon my back and with a book as dry as a rush
devoid of invent meagr in style poor in thought wholli want
in learn and wisdom without quotat in the margin or annot
at the end after the fashion of other book i see which though all
fabl and profan ar so full of maxim from aristotl and plato
and the whole herd of philosoph that thei fill the reader with
amaz and convinc them that the author ar men of learn
erudit and eloqu and then when thei quot the holi
scripturesanyon would sai thei ar st thomas or other doctor of
the church observ as thei do a decorum so ingeni that in on
sentenc thei describ a distract lover and in the next deliv a
devout littl sermon that it is a pleasur and a treat to hear and
read of all thi there will be noth in my book for i have noth
to quot in the margin or to note at the end and still less do i know
what author i follow in it to place them at the begin as all do
under the letter a b c begin with aristotl and end with
xenophon or zoilu or zeuxi though on wa a slander and the
other a painter also my book must do without sonnet at the begin
at least sonnet whose author ar duke marquis count bishop
ladi or famou poet though if i were to ask two or three oblig
friend i know thei would give me them and such as the product of
those that have the highest reput in our spain could not equal
in short my friend i continu i am determin that seor don
quixot shall remain buri in the archiv of hi own la mancha until
heaven provid someon to garnish him with all those thing he stand
in need of becaus i find myself through my shallow and want of
learn unequ to suppli them and becaus i am by natur shy and
careless about hunt for author to sai what i myself can sai without
them henc the cogit and abstract you found me in and reason
enough what you have heard from me
hear thi my friend give himself a slap on the forehead and
break into a hearti laugh exclaim befor god brother now am i
disabus of an error in which i have been live all thi long time i
have known you all through which i have taken you to be shrewd and
sensibl in all you do but now i see you ar as far from that as the
heaven is from the earth is it possibl that thing of so littl
moment and so easi to set right can occupi and perplex a ripe wit like
your fit to break through and crush far greater obstacl by my
faith thi come not of ani want of abil but of too much
indol and too littl knowledg of life do you want to know if i am
tell the truth well then attend to me and you will see how in
the open and shut of an ey i sweep awai all your difficulti
and suppli all those defici which you sai check and discourag
you from bring befor the world the stori of your famou don
quixot the light and mirror of all knighterrantri
sai on said i listen to hi talk how do you propos to make up
for my diffid and reduc to order thi chao of perplex i am
in
to which he made answer your first difficulti about the sonnet
epigram or complimentari vers which you want for the begin and
which ought to be by person of import and rank can be remov if
you yourself take a littl troubl to make them you can afterward
baptis them and put ani name you like to them father them on
prester john of the indi or the emperor of trebizond who to my
knowledg were said to have been famou poet and even if thei were
not and ani pedant or bachelor should attack you and question the
fact never care two maravedi for that for even if thei prove a lie
against you thei cannot cut off the hand you wrote it with
as to refer in the margin to the book and author from whom you
take the aphor and sai you put into your stori it is onli
contriv to fit in nice ani sentenc or scrap of latin you mai
happen to have by heart or at ani rate that will not give you much
troubl to look up so as when you speak of freedom and captiv to
insert
non bene pro toto liberta venditur auro
and then refer in the margin to horac or whoever said it or if you
allud to the power of death to come in with
pallida mor quo pulsat pede pauperum taberna
regumqu turr
if it be friendship and the love god bid us bear to our enemi go at
onc to the holi scriptur which you can do with a veri small amount
of research and quot no less than the word of god himself ego
autem dico vobi diligit inimico vestro if you speak of evil
thought turn to the gospel de cord exeunt cogitation mal if
of the fickl of friend there is cato who will give you hi
distich
donec eri felix multo numerabi amico
tempora si fuerint nubila solu eri
with these and such like bit of latin thei will take you for a
grammarian at all event and that nowadai is no small honour and
profit
with regard to ad annot at the end of the book you mai
safe do it in thi wai if you mention ani giant in your book
contriv that it shall be the giant goliath and with thi alon which
will cost you almost noth you have a grand note for you can
putth giant golia or goliath wa a philistin whom the shepherd
david slew by a mighti stonecast in the terebinth vallei as is
relat in the book of kingsin the chapter where you find it written
next to prove yourself a man of erudit in polit literatur and
cosmographi manag that the river tagu shall be name in your stori
and there you ar at onc with anoth famou annot set
forthth river tagu wa so call after a king of spain it ha it
sourc in such and such a place and fall into the ocean kiss the
wall of the famou citi of lisbon and it is a common belief that it
ha golden sand etc if you should have anyth to do with robber
i will give you the stori of cacu for i have it by heart if with
loos women there is the bishop of mondonedo who will give you the
loan of lamia laida and flora ani refer to whom will bring you
great credit if with hardheart on ovid will furnish you with
medea if with witch or enchantress homer ha calypso and virgil
circ if with valiant captain juliu csar himself will lend you
himself in hi own commentari and plutarch will give you a
thousand alexand if you should deal with love with two ounc you
mai know of tuscan you can go to leon the hebrew who will suppli you
to your heart content or if you should not care to go to foreign
countri you have at home fonseca of the love of god in which is
condens all that you or the most imagin mind can want on the
subject in short all you have to do is to manag to quot these
name or refer to these stori i have mention and leav it to me
to insert the annot and quotat and i swear by all that
good to fill your margin and us up four sheet at the end of the
book
now let us come to those refer to author which other book have
and you want for your the remedi for thi is veri simpl you have
onli to look out for some book that quot them all from a to z as you
sai yourself and then insert the veri same alphabet in your book and
though the imposit mai be plain to see becaus you have so littl
need to borrow from them that is no matter there will probabl be
some simpl enough to believ that you have made us of them all in
thi plain artless stori of your at ani rate if it answer no other
purpos thi long catalogu of author will serv to give a surpris
look of author to your book besid no on will troubl himself to
verifi whether you have follow them or whether you have not be no
wai concern in it especi as if i mistak not thi book of
your ha no need of ani on of those thing you sai it want for it
is from begin to end an attack upon the book of chivalri of
which aristotl never dreamt nor st basil said a word nor cicero had
ani knowledg nor do the niceti of truth nor the observ of
astrolog come within the rang of it fanci vagari nor have
geometr measur or refut of the argument us in
rhetor anyth to do with it nor doe it mean to preach to anybodi
mix up thing human and divin a sort of motlei in which no
christian understand should dress itself it ha onli to avail
itself of truth to natur in it composit and the more perfect the
imit the better the work will be and as thi piec of your aim
at noth more than to destroi the author and influenc which book
of chivalri have in the world and with the public there is no need for
you to go abeg for aphor from philosoph precept from holi
scriptur fabl from poet speech from orat or miracl from
saint but mere to take care that your style and diction run
music pleasantli and plainli with clear proper and wellplac
word set forth your purpos to the best of your power and
put your idea intellig without confus or obscur
strive too that in read your stori the melancholi mai be move to
laughter and the merri made merrier still that the simpl shall not
be weari that the judici shall admir the invent that the
grave shall not despis it nor the wise fail to prais it final
keep your aim fix on the destruct of that illfound edific of
the book of chivalri hate by some and prais by mani more for if
you succe in thi you will have achiev no small success
in profound silenc i listen to what my friend said and hi
observ made such an impress on me that without attempt to
question them i admit their sound and out of them i determin
to make thi prefac wherein gentl reader thou wilt perceiv my
friend good sens my good fortun in find such an advis in such

in a villag of la mancha the name of which i have no desir to call
to mind there live not long sinc on of those gentlemen that keep a
lanc in the lancerack an old buckler a lean hack and a greyhound
for cours an olla of rather more beef than mutton a salad on most
night scrap on saturdai lentil on fridai and a pigeon or so
extra on sundai made awai with threequart of hi incom the rest
of it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breech and shoe to
match for holidai while on weekdai he made a brave figur in hi
best homespun he had in hi hous a housekeep past forti a niec
under twenti and a lad for the field and marketplac who us to
saddl the hack as well as handl the billhook the ag of thi
gentleman of our wa border on fifti he wa of a hardi habit
spare gauntfeatur a veri earli riser and a great sportsman thei
will have it hi surnam wa quixada or quesada for here there is some
differ of opinion among the author who write on the subject
although from reason conjectur it seem plain that he wa call
quexana thi howev is of but littl import to our tale it
will be enough not to strai a hair breadth from the truth in the
tell of it
you must know then that the abovenam gentleman whenev he wa at
leisur which wa mostli all the year round gave himself up to
read book of chivalri with such ardour and avid that he almost
entir neglect the pursuit of hi fieldsport and even the
manag of hi properti and to such a pitch did hi eager and
infatu go that he sold mani an acr of tillageland to bui book of
chivalri to read and brought home as mani of them as he could get but
of all there were none he like so well as those of the famou
feliciano de silva composit for their lucid of style and
complic conceit were as pearl in hi sight particularli when in
hi read he came upon courtship and cartel where he often found
passag like the reason of the unreason with which my reason is
afflict so weaken my reason that with reason i murmur at your
beauti or again the high heaven that of your divin divin
fortifi you with the star render you deserv of the desert your
great deserv over conceit of thi sort the poor gentleman
lost hi wit and us to lie awak strive to understand them and
worm the mean out of them what aristotl himself could not have
made out or extract had he come to life again for that special
purpos he wa not at all easi about the wound which don beliani
gave and took becaus it seem to him that great as were the
surgeon who had cure him he must have had hi face and bodi cover
all over with seam and scar he commend howev the author wai
of end hi book with the promis of that intermin adventur and
mani a time wa he tempt to take up hi pen and finish it properli as
is there propos which no doubt he would have done and made a
success piec of work of it too had not greater and more absorb
thought prevent him
mani an argument did he have with the curat of hi villag a learn
man and a graduat of siguenza as to which had been the better
knight palmerin of england or amadi of gaul master nichola the
villag barber howev us to sai that neither of them came up to
the knight of phbu and that if there wa ani that could compar with
him it wa don galaor the brother of amadi of gaul becaus he had
a spirit that wa equal to everi occas and wa no finikin knight
nor lachrymos like hi brother while in the matter of valour he wa
not a whit behind him in short he becam so absorb in hi book
that he spent hi night from sunset to sunris and hi dai from dawn
to dark pore over them and what with littl sleep and much read
hi brain got so dry that he lost hi wit hi fanci grew full of
what he us to read about in hi book enchant quarrel
battl challeng wound woo love agoni and all sort of
imposs nonsens and it so possess hi mind that the whole fabric
of invent and fanci he read of wa true that to him no histori in
the world had more realiti in it he us to sai the cid rui diaz wa a
veri good knight but that he wa not to be compar with the knight of
the burn sword who with on backstrok cut in half two fierc and
monstrou giant he thought more of bernardo del carpio becaus at
roncesval he slew roland in spite of enchant avail himself
of the artific of hercul when he strangl antu the son of terra
in hi arm he approv highli of the giant morgant becaus
although of the giant breed which is alwai arrog and
illcondit he alon wa affabl and wellbr but abov all he
admir reinaldo of montalban especi when he saw him salli
forth from hi castl and rob everyon he met and when beyond the
sea he stole that imag of mahomet which as hi histori sai wa
entir of gold to have a bout of kick at that traitor of a
ganelon he would have given hi housekeep and hi niec into the
bargain
in short hi wit be quit gone he hit upon the strangest notion
that ever madman in thi world hit upon and that wa that he fanci
it wa right and requisit as well for the support of hi own honour
as for the servic of hi countri that he should make a knighterr
of himself roam the world over in full armour and on horseback in
quest of adventur and put in practic himself all that he had
read of as be the usual practic of knightserr right everi
kind of wrong and expos himself to peril and danger from which in
the issu he wa to reap etern renown and fame alreadi the poor man
saw himself crown by the might of hi arm emperor of trebizond at
least and so led awai by the intens enjoy he found in these
pleasant fanci he set himself forthwith to put hi scheme into
execut
the first thing he did wa to clean up some armour that had belong to
hi greatgrandfath and had been for ag ly forgotten in a
corner eaten with rust and cover with mildew he scour and polish
it as best he could but he perceiv on great defect in it that it
had no close helmet noth but a simpl morion thi defici
howev hi ingenu suppli for he contriv a kind of halfhelmet
of pasteboard which fit on to the morion look like a whole on
it is true that in order to see if it wa strong and fit to stand a
cut he drew hi sword and gave it a coupl of slash the first of
which undid in an instant what had taken him a week to do the eas
with which he had knock it to piec disconcert him somewhat and
to guard against that danger he set to work again fix bar of iron
on the insid until he wa satisfi with it strength and then not
care to try ani more experi with it he pass it and adopt it
as a helmet of the most perfect construct
he next proceed to inspect hi hack which with more quarto than a
real and more blemish than the steed of gonela that tantum pelli
et ossa fuit surpass in hi ey the bucephalu of alexand or
the babieca of the cid four dai were spent in think what name to
give him becaus as he said to himself it wa not right that a hors
belong to a knight so famou and on with such merit of hi own
should be without some distinct name and he strove to adapt it so
as to indic what he had been befor belong to a knighterr
and what he then wa for it wa onli reason that hi master
take a new charact he should take a new name and that it should
be a distinguish and fullsound on befit the new order and
call he wa about to follow and so after have compos struck
out reject ad to unmad and remad a multitud of name out of
hi memori and fanci he decid upon call him rocinant a name to
hi think lofti sonor and signific of hi condit as a
hack befor he becam what he now wa the first and foremost of all
the hack in the world
have got a name for hi hors so much to hi tast he wa anxiou to
get on for himself and he wa eight dai more ponder over thi
point till at last he made up hi mind to call himself don quixot
whenc as ha been alreadi said the author of thi veraci histori
have infer that hi name must have been beyond a doubt quixada and
not quesada as other would have it recollect howev that the
valiant amadi wa not content to call himself curtli amadi and
noth more but ad the name of hi kingdom and countri to make it
famou and call himself amadi of gaul he like a good knight
resolv to add on the name of hi and to style himself don quixot of
la mancha wherebi he consid he describ accur hi origin
and countri and did honour to it in take hi surnam from it
so then hi armour be furbish hi morion turn into a helmet
hi hack christen and he himself confirm he came to the
conclus that noth more wa need now but to look out for a ladi
to be in love with for a knighterr without love wa like a tree
without leav or fruit or a bodi without a soul as he said to
himself if for my sin or by my good fortun i come across some
giant hereabout a common occurr with knightserr and
overthrow him in on onslaught or cleav him asund to the waist or
in short vanquish and subdu him will it not be well to have someon
i mai send him to as a present that he mai come in and fall on hi
knee befor my sweet ladi and in a humbl submiss voic sai i
am the giant caraculiambro lord of the island of malindrania
vanquish in singl combat by the never suffici extol knight
don quixot of la mancha who ha command me to present myself befor
your grace that your high dispos of me at your pleasur oh
how our good gentleman enjoi the deliveri of thi speech especi
when he had thought of someon to call hi ladi there wa so the
stori goe in a villag near hi own a veri goodlook farmgirl
with whom he had been at on time in love though so far as is known
she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter her name wa
aldonza lorenzo and upon her he thought fit to confer the titl of
ladi of hi thought and after some search for a name which should not
be out of harmoni with her own and should suggest and indic that of
a princess and great ladi he decid upon call her dulcinea del

when a terribl thought struck him on all but enough to make him
abandon the enterpris at the veri outset it occur to him that he
had not been dub a knight and that accord to the law of chivalri
he neither could nor ought to bear arm against ani knight and that
even if he had been still he ought as a novic knight to wear white

all around to see if he could discov ani castl or shepherd shanti
where he might refresh himself and reliev hi sore want he perceiv
not far out of hi road an inn which wa as welcom as a star guid
him to the portal if not the palac of hi redempt and
quicken hi pace he reach it just as night wa set in at the

them on their wai to sevil with some carrier who had chanc to
halt that night at the inn and as happen what might to our
adventur everyth he saw or imagin seem to him to be and to
happen after the fashion of what he read of the moment he saw the inn
he pictur it to himself as a castl with it four turret and
pinnacl of shine silver not forget the drawbridg and moat and
all the belong usual ascrib to castl of the sort to thi
inn which to him seem a castl he advanc and at a short distanc
from it he check rocinant hope that some dwarf would show himself
upon the battlement and by sound of trumpet give notic that a knight
wa approach the castl but see that thei were slow about it
and that rocinant wa in a hurri to reach the stabl he made for the
inn door and perceiv the two gai damsel who were stand there
and who seem to him to be two fair maiden or love ladi take
their eas at the castl gate
at thi moment it so happen that a swineherd who wa go through
the stubbl collect a drove of pig for without ani apolog that
is what thei ar call gave a blast of hi horn to bring them
togeth and forthwith it seem to don quixot to be what he wa
expect the signal of some dwarf announc hi arriv and so with
prodigi satisfact he rode up to the inn and to the ladi who
see a man of thi sort approach in full armour and with lanc and
buckler were turn in dismai into the inn when don quixot
guess their fear by their flight rais hi pasteboard visor
disclos hi dry dusti visag and with courteou bear and gentl

profess to offer to anyon much less to highborn maiden as your

strain their ey to make out the featur which the clumsi visor
obscur but when thei heard themselv call maiden a thing so
much out of their line thei could not restrain their laughter which

the incomprehens languag and the unpromis look of our cavali

and matter might have gone farther if at that moment the landlord had
not come out who be a veri fat man wa a veri peac on he
see thi grotesqu figur clad in armour that did not match ani more
than hi saddl bridl lanc buckler or corselet wa not at all
indispos to join the damsel in their manifest of amus

thought it best to speak him fairli so he said seor caballero if

your bed is on the flinti rock

and if so you mai dismount and safe reckon upon ani quantiti of
sleepless under thi roof for a twelvemonth not to sai for a

quixot who got down with great difficulti and exert for he had
not broken hi fast all dai and then charg the host to take great
care of hi hors as he wa the best bit of flesh that ever at bread
in thi world the landlord ei him over but did not find him as good
as don quixot said nor even half as good and put him up in the
stabl he return to see what might be want by hi guest whom the
damsel who had by thi time made their peac with him were now
reliev of hi armour thei had taken off hi breastplat and
backpiec but thei neither knew nor saw how to open hi gorget or
remov hi makeshift helmet for he had fasten it with green
ribbon which as there wa no unti the knot requir to be cut
thi howev he would not by ani mean consent to so he remain all
the even with hi helmet on the drollest and oddest figur that can
be imagin and while thei were remov hi armour take the
baggag who were about it for ladi of high degre belong to the
castl he said to them with great sprightli

the girl who were not us to hear rhetor of thi sort had
noth to sai in repli thei onli ask him if he want anyth to
eat i would gladli eat a bit of someth said don quixot for i
feel it would come veri season the dai happen to be a fridai
and in the whole inn there wa noth but some piec of the fish thei
call in castil abadejo in andalusia bacallao and in some place
curadillo and in other troutlet so thei ask him if he thought
he could eat troutlet for there wa no other fish to give him if
there be troutlet enough said don quixot thei will be the same
thing as a trout for it is all on to me whether i am given eight
real in small chang or a piec of eight moreov it mai be that
these troutlet ar like veal which is better than beef or kid which
is better than goat but whatev it be let it come quickli for the
burden and pressur of arm cannot be born without support to the
insid thei laid a tabl for him at the door of the inn for the sake
of the air and the host brought him a portion of illsoak and wors
cook stockfish and a piec of bread as black and mouldi as hi own
armour but a laughabl sight it wa to see him eat for have hi
helmet on and the beaver up he could not with hi own hand put
anyth into hi mouth unless someon els place it there and thi
servic on of the ladi render him but to give him anyth to
drink wa imposs or would have been so had not the landlord bore
a reed and put on end in hi mouth pour the wine into him
through the other all which he bore with patienc rather than sever
the ribbon of hi helmet
while thi wa go on there came up to the inn a sowgeld who as
he approach sound hi reed pipe four or five time and therebi
complet convinc don quixot that he wa in some famou castl and
that thei were regal him with music and that the stockfish wa
trout the bread the whitest the wench ladi and the landlord the
castellan of the castl and consequ he held that hi enterpris
and salli had been to some purpos but still it distress him to
think he had not been dub a knight for it wa plain to him he could

had alreadi some suspicion of hi guest want of wit wa quit
convinc of it on hear talk of thi kind from him and to make
sport for the night he determin to fall in with hi humour so he
told him he wa quit right in pursu the object he had in view and

almost everi tribun and court of justic in spain until at last he
had retir to thi castl of hi where he wa live upon hi

knightserr of whatev rank or condit thei might be all for the
great love he bore them and that thei might share their substanc with
him in return for hi benevol he told him moreov that in thi
castl of hi there wa no chapel in which he could watch hi armour
as it had been pull down in order to be rebuilt but that in a case
of necess it might he knew be watch anywher and he might watch
it that night in a courtyard of the castl and in the morn god
will the requisit ceremoni might be perform so as to have him
dub a knight and so thoroughli dub that nobodi could be more so
he ask if he had ani monei with him to which don quixot repli
that he had not a farth as in the histori of knightserr he
had never read of ani of them carri ani on thi point the landlord
told him he wa mistaken for though not record in the histori
becaus in the author opinion there wa no need to mention anyth
so obviou and necessari as monei and clean shirt it wa not to be
suppos therefor that thei did not carri them and he might regard it
as certain and establish that all knightserr about whom there
were so mani full and unimpeach book carri wellfurnish
purs in case of emerg and likewis carri shirt and a littl
box of ointment to cure the wound thei receiv for in those plain
and desert where thei engag in combat and came out wound it wa
not alwai that there wa someon to cure them unless inde thei had
for a friend some sage magician to succour them at onc by fetch
through the air upon a cloud some damsel or dwarf with a vial of water
of such virtu that by tast on drop of it thei were cure of their
hurt and wound in an instant and left as sound as if thei had not
receiv ani damag whatev but in case thi should not occur the
knight of old took care to see that their squir were provid with
monei and other requisit such as lint and ointment for heal
purpos and when it happen that knight had no squir which wa
rare and seldom the case thei themselv carri everyth in
cun saddlebag that were hardli seen on the hors croup as if
it were someth els of more import becaus unless for some
such reason carri saddlebag wa not veri favour regard
among knightserr he therefor advis him and as hi godson so
soon to be he might even command him never from that time forth to
travel without monei and the usual requir and he would find the
advantag of them when he least expect it
don quixot promis to follow hi advic scrupul and it wa
arrang forthwith that he should watch hi armour in a larg yard at
on side of the inn so collect it all togeth don quixot place
it on a trough that stood by the side of a well and brace hi
buckler on hi arm he grasp hi lanc and began with a state air to
march up and down in front of the trough and as he began hi march
night began to fall
the landlord told all the peopl who were in the inn about the craze of

contempl full of wonder at so strang a form of mad thei
flock to see it from a distanc and observ with what composur he
sometim pace up and down or sometim lean on hi lanc gaze

voic o thou whoever thou art rash knight that comest to lai hand
on the armour of the most valor errant that ever girt on sword have
a care what thou dost touch it not unless thou wouldst lai down thy
life as the penalti of thy rash the carrier gave no heed to these
word and he would have done better to heed them if he had been

with these word and other to the same purpos drop hi buckler

him and he allow them to carri off the wound and with the same
calm and composur as befor resum the watch over hi armour
but these freak of hi guest were not much to the like of the
landlord so he determin to cut matter short and confer upon him at
onc the unlucki order of knighthood befor ani further misadventur
could occur so go up to him he apologis for the rude which
without hi knowledg had been offer to him by these low peopl
who howev had been well punish for their audac as he had
alreadi told him he said there wa no chapel in the castl nor wa
it need for what remain to be done for as he understood the
ceremoni of the order the whole point of be dub a knight lai
in the accolad and in the slap on the shoulder and that could be
administ in the middl of a field and that he had now done all
that wa need as to watch the armour for all requir were
satisfi by a watch of two hour onli while he had been more than
four about it don quixot believ it all and told him he stood there
readi to obei him and to make an end of it with as much despatch as
possibl for if he were again attack and felt himself to be dub

kneel down then read from hi accountbook as if he were repeat
some devout prayer in the middl of hi deliveri he rais hi hand
and gave him a sturdi blow on the neck and then with hi own sword a
smart slap on the shoulder all the while mutter between hi teeth
as if he wa sai hi prayer have done thi he direct on of
the ladi to gird on hi sword which she did with great
selfpossess and graviti and not a littl wa requir to prevent a
burst of laughter at each stage of the ceremoni but what thei had
alreadi seen of the novic knight prowess kept their laughter within
bound on gird him with the sword the worthi ladi said to him mai
god make your worship a veri fortun knight and grant you success in

acquir by the might of hi arm she answer with great humil that
she wa call la tolosa and that she wa the daughter of a cobbler of
toledo who live in the stall of sanchobienaya and that wherev she

exclaim with a haughti gestur all the world stand unless all the
world confess that in all the world there is no maiden fairer than the
empress of la mancha the peerless dulcinea del toboso
the trader halt at the sound of thi languag and the sight of the
strang figur that utter it and from both figur and languag at

have recours to hi usual remedi which wa to think of some passag
in hi book and hi craze brought to hi mind that about baldwin and
the marqui of mantua when carloto left him wound on the
mountainsid a stori known by heart by the children not forgotten by
the young men and laud and even believ by the old folk and for
all that not a whit truer than the miracl of mahomet thi seem to
him to fit exactli the case in which he found himself so make a
show of sever suffer he began to roll on the ground and with
feebl breath repeat the veri word which the wound knight of the
wood is said to have utter
where art thou ladi mine that thou
my sorrow dost not rue
thou canst not know it ladi mine
or els thou art untru
and so he went on with the ballad as far as the line

as chanc would have it when he had got to thi line there happen to
come by a peasant from hi own villag a neighbour of hi who had
been with a load of wheat to the mill and he see the man stretch
there came up to him and ask him who he wa and what wa the matter
with him that he complain so dolefulli
don quixot wa firmli persuad that thi wa the marqui of mantua
hi uncl so the onli answer he made wa to go on with hi ballad in
which he told the tale of hi misfortun and of the love of the
emperor son and hi wife all exactli as the ballad sing it
the peasant stood amaz at hear such nonsens and reliev him of
the visor alreadi batter to piec by blow he wipe hi face
which wa cover with dust and as soon as he had done so he
recognis him and said seor quixada for so he appear to have
been call when he wa in hi sens and had not yet chang from a
quiet countri gentleman into a knighterr who ha brought your
worship to thi pass but to all question the other onli went on with
hi ballad
see thi the good man remov as well as he could hi breastplat
and backpiec to see if he had ani wound but he could perceiv no
blood nor ani mark whatev he then contriv to rais him from the
ground and with no littl difficulti hoist him upon hi ass which
seem to him to be the easiest mount for him and collect the arm
even to the splinter of the lanc he ti them on rocinant and
lead him by the bridl and the ass by the halter he took the road
for the villag veri sad to hear what absurd stuff don quixot wa
talk

nor wa don quixot less so for what with blow and bruis he could
not sit upright on the ass and from time to time he sent up sigh to
heaven so that onc more he drove the peasant to ask what ail him
and it could have been onli the devil himself that put into hi head
tale to match hi own adventur for now forget baldwin he
bethought himself of the moor abindarraez when the alcaid of
antequera rodrigo de narvaez took him prison and carri him awai
to hi castl so that when the peasant again ask him how he wa and
what ail him he gave him for repli the same word and phrase that
the captiv abindarraez gave to rodrigo de narvaez just as he had read
the stori in the diana of jorg de montemayor where it is written
appli it to hi own case so aptli that the peasant went along
curs hi fate that he had to listen to such a lot of nonsens from
which howev he came to the conclus that hi neighbour wa mad
and so made all hast to reach the villag to escap the wearisom
of thi harangu of don quixot who at the end of it said seor
don rodrigo de narvaez your worship must know that thi fair xarifa i
have mention is now the love dulcinea del toboso for whom i have
done am do and will do the most famou deed of chivalri that in
thi world have been seen ar to be seen or ever shall be seen
to thi the peasant answer seorsinn that i amcannot your
worship see that i am not don rodrigo de narvaez nor the marqui of
mantua but pedro alonso your neighbour and that your worship is
neither baldwin nor abindarraez but the worthi gentleman seor
quixada
i know who i am repli don quixot and i know that i mai be not
onli those i have name but all the twelv peer of franc and even
all the nine worthi sinc my achiev surpass all that thei have
done all togeth and each of them on hi own account
with thi talk and more of the same kind thei reach the villag just
as night wa begin to fall but the peasant wait until it wa a
littl later that the belabour gentleman might not be seen ride in
such a miser trim when it wa what seem to him the proper time
he enter the villag and went to don quixot hous which he found
all in confus and there were the curat and the villag barber who
were great friend of don quixot and hi housekeep wa sai to
them in a loud voic what doe your worship think can have befallen
my master seor licenti pero perez for so the curat wa call
it is three dai now sinc anyth ha been seen of him or the hack
or the buckler lanc or armour miser me i am certain of it and
it is as true as that i wa born to die that these accurs book of
chivalri he ha and ha got into the wai of read so constantli
have upset hi reason for now i rememb have often heard him sai
to himself that he would turn knighterr and go all over the world
in quest of adventur to the devil and barabba with such book that
have brought to ruin in thi wai the finest understand there wa in
all la mancha
the niec said the same and more you must know master
nicholasfor that wa the name of the barberit wa often my uncl
wai to stai two dai and night togeth pore over these unholi book
of misventur after which he would fling the book awai and snatch up
hi sword and fall to slash the wall and when he wa tire out he
would sai he had kill four giant like four tower and the sweat
that flow from him when he wa weari he said wa the blood of the
wound he had receiv in battl and then he would drink a great jug
of cold water and becom calm and quiet sai that thi water wa a
most preciou potion which the sage esquif a great magician and
friend of hi had brought him but i take all the blame upon myself
for never have told your worship of my uncl vagari that you
might put a stop to them befor thing had come to thi pass and burn
all these accurs booksfor he ha a great numberthat richli deserv
to be burn like heret
so sai i too said the curat and by my faith tomorrow shall not
pass without public judgment upon them and mai thei be condemn to
the flame lest thei lead those that read to behav as my good friend
seem to have behav
all thi the peasant heard and from it he understood at last what wa
the matter with hi neighbour so he began call aloud open your
worship to seor baldwin and to seor the marqui of mantua who
come badli wound and to seor abindarraez the moor whom the
valiant rodrigo de narvaez the alcaid of antequera bring captiv
at these word thei all hurri out and when thei recognis their
friend master and uncl who had not yet dismount from the ass
becaus he could not thei ran to embrac him
hold said he for i am badli wound through my hors fault
carri me to bed and if possibl send for the wise urganda to cure and
see to my wound
see there plagu on it cri the housekeep at thi did not my
heart tell the truth as to which foot my master went lame of to bed
with your worship at onc and we will contriv to cure you here
without fetch that hurgada a curs i sai onc more and a hundr
time more on those book of chivalri that have brought your worship

thei carri him to bed at onc and after search for hi wound
could find none but he said thei were all bruis from have had a
sever fall with hi hors rocinant when in combat with ten giant
the biggest and the boldest to be found on earth
so so said the curat ar there giant in the danc by the sign
of the cross i will burn them tomorrow befor the dai is over
thei put a host of question to don quixot but hi onli answer to all
wasgiv him someth to eat and leav him to sleep for that wa
what he need most thei did so and the curat question the peasant
at great length as to how he had found don quixot he told him and
the nonsens he had talk when found and on the wai home all which
made the licenti the more eager to do what he did the next dai
which wa to summon hi friend the barber master nichola and go with

he wa still sleep so the curat ask the niec for the kei of
the room where the book the author of all the mischief were and
right willingli she gave them thei all went in the housekeep with
them and found more than a hundr volum of big book veri well
bound and some other small on the moment the housekeep saw them
she turn about and ran out of the room and came back immedi
with a saucer of holi water and a sprinkler sai here your
worship seor licenti sprinkl thi room dont leav ani magician
of the mani there ar in these book to bewitch us in reveng for our
design of banish them from the world
the simplic of the housekeep made the licenti laugh and he
direct the barber to give him the book on by on to see what thei
were about as there might be some to be found among them that did not
deserv the penalti of fire
no said the niec there is no reason for show merci to ani of
them thei have everi on of them done mischief better fling them out
of the window into the court and make a pile of them and set fire to
them or els carri them into the yard and there a bonfir can be made
without the smoke give ani annoy the housekeep said the same
so eager were thei both for the slaughter of those innoc but the
curat would not agre to it without first read at ani rate the
titl
the first that master nichola put into hi hand wa the four book of
amadi of gaul thi seem a mysteri thing said the curat
for as i have heard sai thi wa the first book of chivalri print
in spain and from thi all the other deriv their birth and origin
so it seem to me that we ought inexor to condemn it to the flame
as the founder of so vile a sect
nai sir said the barber i too have heard sai that thi is the
best of all the book of thi kind that have been written and so as
someth singular in it line it ought to be pardon
true said the curat and for that reason let it life be spare
for the present let us see that other which is next to it
it is said the barber the serga de esplandian the law son
of amadi of gaul
then verili said the curat the merit of the father must not be
put down to the account of the son take it mistress housekeep open
the window and fling it into the yard and lai the foundat of the
pile for the bonfir we ar to make
the housekeep obei with great satisfact and the worthi
esplandian went fly into the yard to await with all patienc the
fire that wa in store for him
proce said the curat
thi that come next said the barber is amadi of greec and
inde i believ all those on thi side ar of the same amadi
lineag
then to the yard with the whole of them said the curat for to
have the burn of queen pintiquiniestra and the shepherd darinel and
hi eclogu and the bedevil and involv discours of hi author
i would burn with them the father who begot me if he were go about
in the guis of a knighterr
i am of the same mind said the barber
and so am i ad the niec
in that case said the housekeep here into the yard with them
thei were hand to her and as there were mani of them she spare
herself the staircas and flung them down out of the window
who is that tub there said the curat
thi said the barber is don olivant de laura
the author of that book said the curat wa the same that wrote
the garden of flower and truli there is no decid which of the
two book is the more truth or to put it better the less ly
all i can sai is send thi on into the yard for a swagger fool
thi that follow is florismart of hircania said the barber
seor florismart here said the curat then by my faith he must
take up hi quarter in the yard in spite of hi marvel birth and
visionari adventur for the stiff and dryness of hi style
deserv noth els into the yard with him and the other mistress
housekeep
with all my heart seor said she and execut the order with great
delight
thi said the barber is the knight platir
an old book that said the curat but i find no reason for clemenc
in it send it after the other without appeal which wa done
anoth book wa open and thei saw it wa entitl the knight of
the cross
for the sake of the holi name thi book ha said the curat it
ignor might be excus but then thei sai behind the cross
there the devil to the fire with it
take down anoth book the barber said thi is the mirror of
chivalri
i know hi worship said the curat that is where seor reinaldo
of montalvan figur with hi friend and comrad greater thiev
than cacu and the twelv peer of franc with the veraci historian
turpin howev i am not for condemn them to more than perpetu
banish becaus at ani rate thei have some share in the invent
of the famou matteo boiardo whenc too the christian poet ludovico
ariosto wove hi web to whom if i find him here and speak ani
languag but hi own i shall show no respect whatev but if he
speak hi own tongu i will put him upon my head
well i have him in italian said the barber but i do not
understand him
nor would it be well that you should understand him said the curat
and on that score we might have excus the captain if he had not
brought him into spain and turn him into castilian he rob him of
a great deal of hi natur forc and so do all those who try to turn
book written in vers into anoth languag for with all the pain
thei take and all the clever thei show thei never can reach the
level of the origin as thei were first produc in short i sai
that thi book and all that mai be found treat of those french
affair should be thrown into or deposit in some dry well until
after more consider it is settl what is to be done with them
except alwai on bernardo del carpio that is go about and
anoth call roncesval for these if thei come into my hand
shall pass at onc into those of the housekeep and from her into
the fire without ani repriev
to all thi the barber gave hi assent and look upon it as right and
proper be persuad that the curat wa so staunch to the faith and
loyal to the truth that he would not for the world sai anyth oppos
to them open anoth book he saw it wa palmerin de oliva and
besid it wa anoth call palmerin of england see which the
licenti said let the oliv be made firewood of at onc and burn
until no ash even ar left and let that palm of england be kept and
preserv as a thing that stand alon and let such anoth case be
made for it as that which alexand found among the spoil of dariu
and set asid for the safe keep of the work of the poet homer thi
book gossip is of author for two reason first becaus it is veri
good and secondli becaus it is said to have been written by a wise
and witti king of portug all the adventur at the castl of
miraguarda ar excel and of admir contriv and the languag
is polish and clear studi and observ the style befit the
speaker with proprieti and judgment so then provid it seem good to
you master nichola i sai let thi and amadi of gaul be remit
the penalti of fire and as for all the rest let them perish without
further question or queri
nai gossip said the barber for thi that i have here is the
famou don beliani
well said the curat that and the second third and fourth part
all stand in need of a littl rhubarb to purg their excess of bile
and thei must be clear of all that stuff about the castl of fame and
other greater affect to which end let them be allow the
oversea term and accord as thei mend so shall merci or justic
be mete out to them and in the mean time gossip do you keep them in
your hous and let no on read them
with all my heart said the barber and not care to tire himself
with read more book of chivalri he told the housekeep to take
all the big on and throw them into the yard it wa not said to on
dull or deaf but to on who enjoi burn them more than weav the
broadest and finest web that could be and seiz about eight at a
time she flung them out of the window
in carri so mani togeth she let on fall at the feet of the
barber who took it up curiou to know whose it wa and found it
said histori of the famou knight tirant el blanco
god bless me said the curat with a shout tirant el blanco
here hand it over gossip for in it i reckon i have found a treasuri
of enjoy and a mine of recreat here is don kyrieleison of
montalvan a valiant knight and hi brother thoma of montalvan and
the knight fonseca with the battl the bold tirant fought with the
mastiff and the wittic of the damsel placerdemivida and the love
and wile of the widow reposada and the empress in love with the
squir hipolitoin truth gossip by right of it style it is the best
book in the world here knight eat and sleep and die in their bed
and make their will befor dy and a great deal more of which there
is noth in all the other book nevertheless i sai he who wrote it
for deliber compos such fooleri deserv to be sent to the
gallei for life take it home with you and read it and you will see
that what i have said is true
as you will said the barber but what ar we to do with these
littl book that ar left
these must be not chivalri but poetri said the curat and open
on he saw it wa the diana of jorg de montemayor and suppos
all the other to be of the same sort these he said do not
deserv to be burn like the other for thei neither do nor can do
the mischief the book of chivalri have done be book of
entertain that can hurt no on
ah seor said the niec your worship had better order these to be
burn as well as the other for it would be no wonder if after be
cure of hi chivalri disord my uncl by read these took a
fanci to turn shepherd and rang the wood and field sing and
pipe or what would be still wors to turn poet which thei sai is
an incur and infecti maladi
the damsel is right said the curat and it will be well to put
thi stumblingblock and temptat out of our friend wai to begin
then with the diana of montemayor i am of opinion it should not be
burn but that it should be clear of all that about the sage
felicia and the magic water and of almost all the longer piec of
vers let it keep and welcom it prose and the honour of be the
first of book of the kind
thi that come next said the barber is the diana entitl the
second part by the salamancan and thi other ha the same titl
and it author is gil polo
as for that of the salamancan repli the curat let it go to
swell the number of the condemn in the yard and let gil polo be
preserv as if it came from apollo himself but get on gossip and
make hast for it is grow late
thi book said the barber open anoth is the ten book of the
fortun of love written by antonio de lofraso a sardinian poet
by the order i have receiv said the curat sinc apollo ha
been apollo and the muse have been muse and poet have been poet
so droll and absurd a book as thi ha never been written and in it
wai it is the best and the most singular of all of thi speci that
have as yet appear and he who ha not read it mai be sure he ha
never read what is delight give it here gossip for i make more
account of have found it than if thei had given me a cassock of
florenc stuff
he put it asid with extrem satisfact and the barber went on
these that come next ar the shepherd of iberia nymph of
henar and the enlighten of jealousi
then all we have to do said the curat is to hand them over to the
secular arm of the housekeep and ask me not why or we shall never
have done
thi next is the pastor de flida
no pastor that said the curat but a highli polish courtier let
it be preserv as a preciou jewel
thi larg on here said the barber is call the treasuri of
variou poem
if there were not so mani of them said the curat thei would be
more relish thi book must be weed and cleans of certain
vulgar which it ha with it excel let it be preserv
becaus the author is a friend of mine and out of respect for other
more heroic and loftier work that he ha written
thi continu the barber is the cancionero of lopez de
maldonado
the author of that book too said the curat is a great friend of
mine and hi vers from hi own mouth ar the admir of all who
hear them for such is the sweet of hi voic that he enchant when
he chant them it give rather too much of it eclogu but what is
good wa never yet plenti let it be kept with those that have been
set apart but what book is that next it
the galatea of miguel de cervant said the barber
that cervant ha been for mani year a great friend of mine and to
my knowledg he ha had more experi in revers than in vers hi
book ha some good invent in it it present us with someth but
bring noth to a conclus we must wait for the second part it
promis perhap with amend it mai succe in win the full
measur of grace that is now deni it and in the mean time do you
seor gossip keep it shut up in your own quarter
veri good said the barber and here come three togeth the
araucana of don alonso de ercilla the austriada of juan rufo
justic of cordova and the montserr of christob de viru the
valencian poet
these three book said the curat ar the best that have been
written in castilian in heroic vers and thei mai compar with the
most famou of itali let them be preserv as the richest treasur of
poetri that spain possess
the curat wa tire and would not look into ani more book and so he
decid that content uncertifi all the rest should be burn
but just then the barber held open on call the tear of angelica
i should have shed tear myself said the curat when he heard the
titl had i order that book to be burn for it author wa on of
the famou poet of the world not to sai of spain and wa veri happi

the scrutini of the remain book and so it is thought that the
carolea the lion of spain and the deed of the emperor written
by don lui de vila went to the fire unseen and unheard for no doubt
thei were among those that remain and perhap if the curat had seen
them thei would not have undergon so sever a sentenc
when thei reach don quixot he wa alreadi out of bed and wa still
shout and rave and slash and cut all round as wide awak
as if he had never slept
thei close with him and by forc got him back to bed and when he had
becom a littl calm address the curat he said to him of a
truth seor archbishop turpin it is a great disgrac for us who call
ourselv the twelv peer so carelessli to allow the knight of the
court to gain the victori in thi tournei we the adventur have
carri off the honour on the three former dai
hush gossip said the curat pleas god the luck mai turn and
what is lost todai mai be won tomorrow for the present let your
worship have a care of your health for it seem to me that you ar
overfatigu if not badli wound
wound no said don quixot but bruis and batter no doubt for
that bastard don roland ha cudgel me with the trunk of an oak tree
and all for envi becaus he see that i alon rival him in hi
achiev but i should not call myself reinaldo of montalvan did
he not pai me for it in spite of all hi enchant as soon as i rise
from thi bed for the present let them bring me someth to eat for
that i feel is what will be more to my purpos and leav it to me to
aveng myself
thei did as he wish thei gave him someth to eat and onc more he
fell asleep leav them marvel at hi mad
that night the housekeep burn to ash all the book that were in
the yard and in the whole hous and some must have been consum that
deserv preserv in everlast archiv but their fate and the
lazi of the examin did not permit it and so in them wa verifi
the proverb that the innoc suffer for the guilti
on of the remedi which the curat and the barber immedi appli
to their friend disord wa to wall up and plaster the room where
the book were so that when he got up he should not find them
possibl the caus be remov the effect might ceas and thei
might sai that a magician had carri them off room and all and thi
wa done with all despatch two dai later don quixot got up and the
first thing he did wa to go and look at hi book and not find the
room where he had left it he wander from side to side look for
it he came to the place where the door us to be and tri it with
hi hand and turn and twist hi ey in everi direct without
sai a word but after a good while he ask hi housekeep
whereabout wa the room that held hi book
the housekeep who had been alreadi well instruct in what she wa
to answer said what room or what noth is it that your worship is
look for there ar neither room nor book in thi hous now for
the devil himself ha carri all awai
it wa not the devil said the niec but a magician who came on a
cloud on night after the dai your worship left thi and dismount
from a serpent that he rode he enter the room and what he did there
i know not but after a littl while he made off fly through the
roof and left the hous full of smoke and when we went to see what he
had done we saw neither book nor room but we rememb veri well the
housekeep and i that on leav the old villain said in a loud
voic that for a privat grudg he ow the owner of the book and the
room he had done mischief in that hous that would be discov
byandbi he said too that hi name wa the sage muaton
he must have said friston said don quixot
i dont know whether he call himself friston or friton said the
housekeep i onli know that hi name end with ton
so it doe said don quixot and he is a sage magician a great
enemi of mine who ha a spite against me becaus he know by hi art
and lore that in process of time i am to engag in singl combat with a
knight whom he befriend and that i am to conquer and he will be
unabl to prevent it and for thi reason he endeavour to do me all
the ill turn that he can but i promis him it will be hard for him to
oppos or avoid what is decre by heaven
who doubt that said the niec but uncl who mix you up in
these quarrel would it not be better to remain at peac in your own
hous instead of roam the world look for better bread than ever
came of wheat never reflect that mani go for wool and come back
shorn
oh niec of mine repli don quixot how much astrai art thou in
thy reckon er thei shear me i shall have pluck awai and strip
off the beard of all who dare to touch onli the tip of a hair of
mine
the two were unwil to make ani further answer as thei saw that hi
anger wa kindl
in short then he remain at home fifteen dai veri quietli without
show ani sign of a desir to take up with hi former delus and
dure thi time he held live discuss with hi two gossip the
curat and the barber on the point he maintain that knightserr
were what the world stood most in need of and that in him wa to be
accomplish the reviv of knighterrantri the curat sometim
contradict him sometim agre with him for if he had not observ
thi precaut he would have been unabl to bring him to reason
meanwhil don quixot work upon a farm labour a neighbour of hi
an honest man if inde that titl can be given to him who is poor
but with veri littl wit in hi pate in a word he so talk him over
and with such persuas and promis that the poor clown made up hi
mind to salli forth with him and serv him as esquir don quixot
among other thing told him he ought to be readi to go with him
gladli becaus ani moment an adventur might occur that might win an
island in the twinkl of an ey and leav him governor of it on
these and the like promis sancho panza for so the labour wa

don quixot next set about get some monei and sell on thing
and pawn anoth and make a bad bargain in everi case he got
togeth a fair sum he provid himself with a buckler which he
beg as a loan from a friend and restor hi batter helmet as
best he could he warn hi squir sancho of the dai and hour he meant
to set out that he might provid himself with what he thought most
need abov all he charg him to take alforja with him the other
said he would and that he meant to take also a veri good ass he had
as he wa not much given to go on foot about the ass don quixot
hesit a littl try whether he could call to mind ani
knighterr take with him an esquir mount on assback but no
instanc occur to hi memori for all that howev he determin
to take him intend to furnish him with a more honour mount when
a chanc of it present itself by appropri the hors of the
first discourt knight he encount himself he provid with
shirt and such other thing as he could accord to the advic the
host had given him all which be done without take leav sancho
panza of hi wife and children or don quixot of hi housekeep and
niec thei salli forth unseen by anybodi from the villag on night
and made such good wai in the cours of it that by daylight thei held
themselv safe from discoveri even should search be made for them
sancho rode on hi ass like a patriarch with hi alforja and bota
and long to see himself soon governor of the island hi master had
promis him don quixot decid upon take the same rout and road
he had taken on hi first journei that over the campo de montiel
which he travel with less discomfort than on the last occas for
as it wa earli morn and the rai of the sun fell on them obliqu
the heat did not distress them
and now said sancho panza to hi master your worship will take care
seor knighterr not to forget about the island you have promis
me for be it ever so big ill be equal to govern it
to which don quixot repli thou must know friend sancho panza
that it wa a practic veri much in vogu with the knightserr of
old to make their squir governor of the island or kingdom thei
won and i am determin that there shall be no failur on my part in
so liber a custom on the contrari i mean to improv upon it for
thei sometim and perhap most frequent wait until their squir
were old and then when thei had had enough of servic and hard dai
and wors night thei gave them some titl or other of count or at
the most marqui of some vallei or provinc more or less but if thou
livest and i live it mai well be that befor six dai ar over i mai
have won some kingdom that ha other depend upon it which will be
just the thing to enabl thee to be crown king of on of them nor
needst thou count thi wonder for thing and chanc fall to the
lot of such knight in wai so unexampl and unexpect that i might
easili give thee even more than i promis thee
in that case said sancho panza if i should becom a king by on of
those miracl your worship speak of even juana gutierrez my old
woman would come to be queen and my children infant
well who doubt it said don quixot
i doubt it repli sancho panza becaus for my part i am persuad
that though god should shower down kingdom upon earth not on of them
would fit the head of mari gutierrez let me tell you seor she is
not worth two maravedi for a queen countess will fit her better and
that onli with god help
leav it to god sancho return don quixot for he will give her
what suit her best but do not undervalu thyself so much as to come
to be content with anyth less than be governor of a provinc
i will not seor answer sancho special as i have a man of
such qualiti for a master in your worship who will know how to give me
all that will be suitabl for me and that i can bear

at thi point thei came in sight of thirti or forti windmil that
there ar on that plain and as soon as don quixot saw them he said to
hi squir fortun is arrang matter for us better than we could
have shape our desir ourselv for look there friend sancho panza
where thirti or more monstrou giant present themselv all of whom i
mean to engag in battl and slai and with whose spoil we shall begin
to make our fortun for thi is righteou warfar and it is god
good servic to sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth
what giant said sancho panza
those thou seest there answer hi master with the long arm and
some have them nearli two leagu long
look your worship said sancho what we see there ar not giant
but windmil and what seem to be their arm ar the sail that turn
by the wind make the millston go
it is easi to see repli don quixot that thou art not us to
thi busi of adventur those ar giant and if thou art afraid
awai with thee out of thi and betak thyself to prayer while i engag
them in fierc and unequ combat
so sai he gave the spur to hi steed rocinant heedless of the
cri hi squir sancho sent after him warn him that most certainli
thei were windmil and not giant he wa go to attack he howev
wa so posit thei were giant that he neither heard the cri of
sancho nor perceiv near as he wa what thei were but made at them
shout fly not coward and vile be for a singl knight

a slight breez at thi moment sprang up and the great sail began to

than the giant briareu ye have to reckon with me
so sai and commend himself with all hi heart to hi ladi
dulcinea implor her to support him in such a peril with lanc in
rest and cover by hi buckler he charg at rocinant fullest
gallop and fell upon the first mill that stood in front of him but as
he drove hi lancepoint into the sail the wind whirl it round with
such forc that it shiver the lanc to piec sweep with it hors

god order it as he mai said sancho panza and help him to rise
got him up again on rocinant whose shoulder wa half out and then
discuss the late adventur thei follow the road to puerto lapic
for there said don quixot thei could not fail to find adventur in
abund and varieti as it wa a great thoroughfar for all that he
wa much griev at the loss of hi lanc and sai so to hi squir
he ad i rememb have read how a spanish knight diego perez de
varga by name have broken hi sword in battl tore from an oak a
ponder bough or branch and with it did such thing that dai and
pound so mani moor that he got the surnam of machuca and he and
hi descend from that dai forth were call varga y machuca i
mention thi becaus from the first oak i see i mean to rend such
anoth branch larg and stout like that with which i am determin
and resolv to do such deed that thou mayest deem thyself veri
fortun in be found worthi to come and see them and be an
eyewit of thing that will with difficulti be believ
be that as god will said sancho i believ it all as your worship
sai it but straighten yourself a littl for you seem all on on
side mai be from the shake of the fall
that is the truth said don quixot and if i make no complaint of
the pain it is becaus knightserr ar not permit to complain of
ani wound even though their bowel be come out through it
if so said sancho i have noth to sai but god know i would
rather your worship complain when anyth ail you for my part i
confess i must complain howev small the ach mai be unless thi rule
about not complain extend to the squir of knightserr also
don quixot could not help laugh at hi squir simplic and he
assur him he might complain whenev and howev he chose just as he
like for so far he had never read of anyth to the contrari in
the order of knighthood
sancho bade him rememb it wa dinnertim to which hi master
answer that he want noth himself just then but that he might
eat when he had a mind with thi permiss sancho settl himself as
comfort as he could on hi beast and take out of the alforja
what he had stow awai in them he jog along behind hi master
munch deliber and from time to time take a pull at the bota
with a relish that the thirstiest tapster in malaga might have envi
and while he went on in thi wai gulp down draught after draught
he never gave a thought to ani of the promis hi master had made him
nor did he rate it as hardship but rather as recreat go in quest
of adventur howev danger thei might be final thei pass the
night among some tree from on of which don quixot pluck a dry
branch to serv him after a fashion as a lanc and fix on it the
head he had remov from the broken on all that night don quixot lai
awak think of hi ladi dulcinea in order to conform to what he had
read in hi book how mani a night in the forest and desert knight
us to lie sleepless support by the memori of their mistress not
so did sancho panza spend it for have hi stomach full of someth
stronger than chicori water he made but on sleep of it and if hi
master had not call him neither the rai of the sun beat on hi
face nor all the cheeri note of the bird welcom the approach of
dai would have had power to waken him on get up he tri the bota
and found it somewhat less full than the night befor which griev
hi heart becaus thei did not seem to be on the wai to remedi the
defici readili don quixot did not care to break hi fast for as
ha been alreadi said he confin himself to savouri recollect for
nourish
thei return to the road thei had set out with lead to puerto
lapic and at three in the afternoon thei came in sight of it here
brother sancho panza said don quixot when he saw it we mai plung
our hand up to the elbow in what thei call adventur but observ
even shouldst thou see me in the greatest danger in the world thou
must not put a hand to thy sword in my defenc unless inde thou
perceivest that those who assail me ar rabbl or base folk for in
that case thou mayest veri properli aid me but if thei be knight it
is on no account permit or allow thee by the law of knighthood to
help me until thou hast been dub a knight
most certainli seor repli sancho your worship shall be fulli
obei in thi matter all the more as of myself i am peac and no
friend to mix in strife and quarrel it is true that as regard the
defenc of my own person i shall not give much heed to those law for
law human and divin allow each on to defend himself against ani
assail whatev
that i grant said don quixot but in thi matter of aid me
against knight thou must put a restraint upon thy natur
impetuos
i will do so i promis you answer sancho and will keep thi
precept as carefulli as sundai
while thei were thu talk there appear on the road two friar of
the order of st benedict mount on two dromedari for not less
tall were the two mule thei rode on thei wore travel spectacl
and carri sunshad and behind them came a coach attend by four or
five person on horseback and two mulet on foot in the coach there
wa as afterward appear a biscai ladi on her wai to sevil where
her husband wa about to take passag for the indi with an
appoint of high honour the friar though go the same road
were not in her compani but the moment don quixot perceiv them he
said to hi squir either i am mistaken or thi is go to be the
most famou adventur that ha ever been seen for those black bodi
we see there must be and doubtless ar magician who ar carri off
some stolen princess in that coach and with all my might i must undo
thi wrong
thi will be wors than the windmil said sancho look seor
those ar friar of st benedict and the coach plainli belong to some
travel i tell you to mind well what you ar about and dont let
the devil mislead you
i have told thee alreadi sancho repli don quixot that on the
subject of adventur thou knowest littl what i sai is the truth as
thou shalt see present
so sai he advanc and post himself in the middl of the road
along which the friar were come and as soon as he thought thei had
come near enough to hear what he said he cri aloud devilish and
unnatur be releas instantli the highborn princess whom you
ar carri off by forc in thi coach els prepar to meet a speedi
death as the just punish of your evil deed
the friar drew rein and stood wonder at the appear of don
quixot as well as at hi word to which thei repli seor
caballero we ar not devilish or unnatur but two brother of st
benedict follow our road nor do we know whether or not there ar
ani captiv princess come in thi coach
no soft word with me for i know you ly rabbl said don
quixot and without wait for a repli he spur rocinant and with
level lanc charg the first friar with such furi and
determin that if the friar had not flung himself off the mule
he would have brought him to the ground against hi will and sore
wound if not kill outright the second brother see how hi
comrad wa treat drove hi heel into hi castl of a mule and made
off across the countri faster than the wind
sancho panza when he saw the friar on the ground dismount briskli
from hi ass rush toward him and began to strip off hi gown at
that instant the friar mulet came up and ask what he wa
strip him for sancho answer them that thi fell to him lawfulli
as spoil of the battl which hi lord don quixot had won the
mulet who had no idea of a joke and did not understand all thi
about battl and spoil see that don quixot wa some distanc off
talk to the travel in the coach fell upon sancho knock him
down and leav hardli a hair in hi beard belabour him with kick
and left him stretch breathless and senseless on the ground and
without ani more delai help the friar to mount who trembl
terrifi and pale as soon as he found himself in the saddl spur
after hi companion who wa stand at a distanc look on
watch the result of the onslaught then not care to wait for the
end of the affair just begun thei pursu their journei make more
cross than if thei had the devil after them
don quixot wa as ha been said speak to the ladi in the coach

more than that you should return to el toboso and on my behalf present
yourself befor that ladi and tell her what i have done to set you
free
on of the squir in attend upon the coach a biscayan wa
listen to all don quixot wa sai and perceiv that he would
not allow the coach to go on but wa sai it must return at onc to
el toboso he made at him and seiz hi lanc address him in bad
castilian and wors biscayan after hi fashion begon caballero and
ill go with thee by the god that made me unless thou quittest coach
slayest thee as art here a biscayan
don quixot understood him quit well and answer him veri quietli
if thou wert a knight as thou art none i should have alreadi
chastis thy folli and rash miser creatur to which the
biscayan return i no gentlemani swear to god thou liest as i am
christian if thou droppest lanc and drawest sword soon shalt thou
see thou art carri water to the cat biscayan on land hidalgo at
sea hidalgo at the devil and look if thou sayest otherwis thou
liest
you will see present said agraj repli don quixot and
throw hi lanc on the ground he drew hi sword brace hi buckler
on hi arm and attack the biscayan bent upon take hi life
the biscayan when he saw him come on though he wish to dismount
from hi mule in which be on of those sorri on let out for
hire he had no confid had no choic but to draw hi sword it wa
lucki for him howev that he wa near the coach from which he wa
abl to snatch a cushion that serv him for a shield and thei went at
on anoth as if thei had been two mortal enemi the other strove
to make peac between them but could not for the biscayan declar in
hi disjoint phrase that if thei did not let him finish hi battl he
would kill hi mistress and everyon that strove to prevent him the
ladi in the coach amaz and terrifi at what she saw order the
coachman to draw asid a littl and set herself to watch thi sever
struggl in the cours of which the biscayan smote don quixot a
mighti stroke on the shoulder over the top of hi buckler which given
to on without armour would have cleft him to the waist don quixot
feel the weight of thi prodigi blow cri aloud sai o
ladi of my soul dulcinea flower of beauti come to the aid of thi
your knight who in fulfil hi oblig to your beauti find
himself in thi extrem peril to sai thi to lift hi sword to
shelter himself well behind hi buckler and to assail the biscayan wa
the work of an instant determin as he wa to ventur all upon a
singl blow the biscayan see him come on in thi wai wa
convinc of hi courag by hi spirit bear and resolv to
follow hi exampl so he wait for him keep well under cover of
hi cushion be unabl to execut ani sort of manoeuvr with hi
mule which dead tire and never meant for thi kind of game could
not stir a step
on then as aforesaid came don quixot against the wari biscayan
with uplift sword and a firm intent of split him in half
while on hi side the biscayan wait for him sword in hand and under
the protect of hi cushion and all present stood trembl wait
in suspens the result of blow such as threaten to fall and the
ladi in the coach and the rest of her follow were make a thousand
vow and offer to all the imag and shrine of spain that god
might deliv her squir and all of them from thi great peril in which
thei found themselv but it spoil all that at thi point and crisi
the author of the histori leav thi battl impend give as
excus that he could find noth more written about these achiev
of don quixot than what ha been alreadi set forth it is true the
second author of thi work wa unwil to believ that a histori so
curiou could have been allow to fall under the sentenc of oblivion
or that the wit of la mancha could have been so undiscern as not to
preserv in their archiv or registri some document refer to

in the first part of thi histori we left the valiant biscayan and the
renown don quixot with drawn sword uplift readi to deliv two
such furiou slash blow that if thei had fallen full and fair thei
would at least have split and cleft them asund from top to toe and
laid them open like a pomegran and at thi so critic point the
delight histori came to a stop and stood cut short without ani
intim from the author where what wa miss wa to be found
thi distress me greatli becaus the pleasur deriv from have
read such a small portion turn to vexat at the thought of the poor
chanc that present itself of find the larg part that so it
seem to me wa miss of such an interest tale it appear to
me to be a thing imposs and contrari to all preced that so good
a knight should have been without some sage to undertak the task of
write hi marvel achiev a thing that wa never want to
ani of those knightserr who thei sai went after adventur for
everi on of them had on or two sage as if made on purpos who not
onli record their deed but describ their most trifl thought
and folli howev secret thei might be and such a good knight could
not have been so unfortun as not to have what platir and other like
him had in abund and so i could not bring myself to believ that
such a gallant tale had been left maim and mutil and i laid the
blame on time the devour and destroy of all thing that had
either conceal or consum it
on the other hand it struck me that inasmuch as among hi book there
had been found such modern on as the enlighten of jealousi and
the nymph and shepherd of henar hi stori must likewis be
modern and that though it might not be written it might exist in the
memori of the peopl of hi villag and of those in the neighbourhood
thi reflect kept me perplex and long to know realli and truli
the whole life and wondrou deed of our famou spaniard don quixot
of la mancha light and mirror of manchegan chivalri and the first
that in our ag and in these so evil dai devot himself to the labour
and exercis of the arm of knighterrantri right wrong
succour widow and protect damsel of that sort that us to
ride about whip in hand on their palfrei with all their virgin
about them from mountain to mountain and vallei to valleyfor if it
were not for some ruffian or boor with a hood and hatchet or
monstrou giant that forc them there were in dai of yore damsel
that at the end of eighti year in all which time thei had never slept
a dai under a roof went to their grave as much maid as the mother
that bore them i sai then that in these and other respect our
gallant don quixot is worthi of everlast and notabl prais nor
should it be withheld even from me for the labour and pain spent in
search for the conclus of thi delight histori though i know
well that if heaven chanc and good fortun had not help me the
world would have remain depriv of an entertain and pleasur
that for a coupl of hour or so mai well occupi him who shall read it
attent the discoveri of it occur in thi wai
on dai as i wa in the alcana of toledo a boi came up to sell some
pamphlet and old paper to a silk mercer and as i am fond of read
even the veri scrap of paper in the street led by thi natur bent
of mine i took up on of the pamphlet the boi had for sale and saw
that it wa in charact which i recognis as arab and as i wa
unabl to read them though i could recognis them i look about to
see if there were ani spanishspeak morisco at hand to read them for
me nor wa there ani great difficulti in find such an interpret
for even had i sought on for an older and better languag i should
have found him in short chanc provid me with on who when i told
him what i want and put the book into hi hand open it in the
middl and after read a littl in it began to laugh i ask him
what he wa laugh at and he repli that it wa at someth the
book had written in the margin by wai of a note i bade him tell it to
me and he still laugh said in the margin as i told you thi is
written thi dulcinea del toboso so often mention in thi histori
had thei sai the best hand of ani woman in all la mancha for salt
pig
when i heard dulcinea del toboso name i wa struck with surpris and
amaz for it occur to me at onc that these pamphlet contain
the histori of don quixot with thi idea i press him to read the
begin and do so turn the arab offhand into castilian he
told me it meant histori of don quixot of la mancha written by cid
hamet beneng an arab historian it requir great caution to
hide the joi i felt when the titl of the book reach my ear and
snatch it from the silk mercer i bought all the paper and
pamphlet from the boi for half a real and if he had had hi wit
about him and had known how eager i wa for them he might have safe
calcul on make more than six real by the bargain i withdrew at
onc with the morisco into the cloister of the cathedr and beg
him to turn all these pamphlet that relat to don quixot into the
castilian tongu without omit or ad anyth to them offer
him whatev payment he pleas he wa satisfi with two arroba of
raisin and two bushel of wheat and promis to translat them
faithfulli and with all despatch but to make the matter easier and
not to let such a preciou find out of my hand i took him to my
hous where in littl more than a month and a half he translat the
whole just as it is set down here
in the first pamphlet the battl between don quixot and the biscayan
wa drawn to the veri life thei plant in the same attitud as the
histori describ their sword rais and the on protect by hi
buckler the other by hi cushion and the biscayan mule so true to
natur that it could be seen to be a hire on a bowshot off the
biscayan had an inscript under hi feet which said don sancho de
azpeitia which no doubt must have been hi name and at the feet of
rocinant wa anoth that said don quixot rocinant wa
marvel portrai so long and thin so lank and lean with so
much backbon and so far gone in consumpt that he show plainli
with what judgment and proprieti the name of rocinant had been
bestow upon him near him wa sancho panza hold the halter of hi
ass at whose feet wa anoth label that said sancho zanca and
accord to the pictur he must have had a big belli a short bodi
and long shank for which reason no doubt the name of panza and
zanca were given him for by these two surnam the histori sever
time call him some other trifl particular might be mention
but thei ar all of slight import and have noth to do with the
true relat of the histori and no histori can be bad so long as it
is true
if against the present on ani object be rais on the score of it
truth it can onli be that it author wa an arab as ly is a veri
common propens with those of that nation though as thei ar such
enemi of our it is conceiv that there were omiss rather
than addit made in the cours of it and thi is my own opinion
for where he could and should give freedom to hi pen in prais of so
worthi a knight he seem to me deliber to pass it over in
silenc which is ill done and wors contriv for it is the busi
and duti of historian to be exact truth and wholli free from
passion and neither interest nor fear hatr nor love should make
them swerv from the path of truth whose mother is histori rival of
time storehous of deed wit for the past exampl and counsel
for the present and warn for the futur in thi i know will be
found all that can be desir in the pleasantest and if it be want
in ani good qualiti i maintain it is the fault of it hound of an
author and not the fault of the subject to be brief it second part
accord to the translat began in thi wai
with trenchant sword uprais and pois on high it seem as though
the two valiant and wrath combat stood threaten heaven and
earth and hell with such resolut and determin did thei bear
themselv the fieri biscayan wa the first to strike a blow which
wa deliv with such forc and furi that had not the sword turn in
it cours that singl stroke would have suffic to put an end to the
bitter struggl and to all the adventur of our knight but that good
fortun which reserv him for greater thing turn asid the sword
of hi adversari so that although it smote him upon the left shoulder
it did him no more harm than to strip all that side of it armour
carri awai a great part of hi helmet with half of hi ear all
which with fear ruin fell to the ground leav him in a sorri
plight
good god who is there that could properli describ the rage that
fill the heart of our manchegan when he saw himself dealt with in
thi fashion all that can be said is it wa such that he again rais
himself in hi stirrup and grasp hi sword more firmli with both
hand he came down on the biscayan with such furi smite him full
over the cushion and over the head thateven so good a shield prove
uselessa if a mountain had fallen on him he began to bleed from
nose mouth and ear reel as if about to fall backward from hi
mule as no doubt he would have done had he not flung hi arm about
it neck at the same time howev he slip hi feet out of the
stirrup and then unclasp hi arm and the mule take fright at
the terribl blow made off across the plain and with a few plung
flung it master to the ground don quixot stood look on veri
calmli and when he saw him fall leap from hi hors and with great
brisk ran to him and present the point of hi sword to hi
ey bade him surrend or he would cut hi head off the biscayan
wa so bewild that he wa unabl to answer a word and it would
have gone hard with him so blind wa don quixot had not the ladi
in the coach who had hitherto been watch the combat in great
terror hasten to where he stood and implor him with earnest
entreati to grant them the great grace and favour of spare their
squir life to which don quixot repli with much graviti and
digniti in truth fair ladi i am well content to do what ye ask of
me but it must be on on condit and understand which is that
thi knight promis me to go to the villag of el toboso and on my
behalf present himself befor the peerless ladi dulcinea that she deal
with him as shall be most pleas to her
the terrifi and disconsol ladi without discuss don quixot
demand or ask who dulcinea might be promis that their squir
should do all that had been command
then on the faith of that promis said don quixot i shall do him
no further harm though he well deserv it of me

now by thi time sancho had risen rather the wors for the handl of
the friar mulet and stood watch the battl of hi master don
quixot and prai to god in hi heart that it might be hi will to
grant him the victori and that he might therebi win some island to
make him governor of as he had promis see therefor that the
struggl wa now over and that hi master wa return to mount
rocinant he approach to hold the stirrup for him and befor he
could mount he went on hi knee befor him and take hi hand
kiss it sai mai it pleas your worship seor don quixot to
give me the govern of that island which ha been won in thi hard
fight for be it ever so big i feel myself in suffici forc to be
abl to govern it as much and as well as anyon in the world who ha
ever govern island
to which don quixot repli thou must take notic brother sancho
that thi adventur and those like it ar not adventur of island
but of crossroad in which noth is got except a broken head or an
ear the less have patienc for adventur will present themselv
from which i mai make you not onli a governor but someth more
sancho gave him mani thank and again kiss hi hand and the skirt
of hi hauberk help him to mount rocinant and mount hi ass
himself proceed to follow hi master who at a brisk pace without
take leav or sai anyth further to the ladi belong to the
coach turn into a wood that wa hard by sancho follow him at hi
asss best trot but rocinant step out so that see himself left
behind he wa forc to call to hi master to wait for him don
quixot did so rein in rocinant until hi weari squir came up
who on reach him said it seem to me seor it would be prudent
in us to go and take refug in some church for see how maul he
with whom you fought ha been left it will be no wonder if thei give
inform of the affair to the holi brotherhood and arrest us and
faith if thei do befor we come out of gaol we shall have to sweat
for it
peac said don quixot where hast thou ever seen or heard that a
knighterr ha been arraign befor a court of justic howev
mani homicid he mai have commit
i know noth about omecil answer sancho nor in my life have
had anyth to do with on i onli know that the holi brotherhood
look after those who fight in the field and in that other matter i
do not meddl
then thou needst have no uneasi my friend said don quixot
for i will deliv thee out of the hand of the chaldean much more
out of those of the brotherhood but tell me as thou livest hast thou
seen a more valiant knight than i in all the known world hast thou
read in histori of ani who ha or had higher mettl in attack more
spirit in maintain it more dexter in wound or skill in
overthrow
the truth is answer sancho that i have never read ani histori
for i can neither read nor write but what i will ventur to bet is
that a more dare master than your worship i have never serv in all
the dai of my life and god grant that thi dare be not paid for
where i have said what i beg of your worship is to dress your wound
for a great deal of blood flow from that ear and i have here some
lint and a littl white ointment in the alforja
all that might be well dispens with said don quixot if i had
rememb to make a vial of the balsam of fierabra for time and
medicin ar save by on singl drop
what vial and what balsam is that said sancho panza
it is a balsam answer don quixot the receipt of which i have in
my memori with which on need have no fear of death or dread dy of
ani wound and so when i make it and give it to thee thou hast noth
to do when in some battl thou seest thei have cut me in half through
the middl of the bodya is wont to happen frequentlybut neatli and
with great niceti er the blood congeal to place that portion of the
bodi which shall have fallen to the ground upon the other half which
remain in the saddl take care to fit it on evenli and exactli
then thou shalt give me to drink but two drop of the balsam i have
mention and thou shalt see me becom sounder than an appl
if that be so said panza i renounc henceforth the govern of
the promis island and desir noth more in payment of my mani and
faith servic than that your worship give me the receipt of thi
suprem liquor for i am persuad it will be worth more than two real
an ounc anywher and i want no more to pass the rest of my life in
eas and honour but it remain to be told if it cost much to make
it
with less than three real six quart of it mai be made said don
quixot
sinner that i am said sancho then why doe your worship put off
make it and teach it to me
peac friend answer don quixot greater secret i mean to teach
thee and greater favour to bestow upon thee and for the present let
us see to the dress for my ear pain me more than i could wish
sancho took out some lint and ointment from the alforja but when don
quixot came to see hi helmet shatter he wa like to lose hi
sens and clap hi hand upon hi sword and rais hi ey to
heaven he said i swear by the creator of all thing and the four
gospel in their fullest extent to do as the great marqui of mantua
did when he swore to aveng the death of hi nephew baldwin and that
wa not to eat bread from a tablecloth nor embrac hi wife and
other point which though i cannot now call them to mind i here grant
as express until i take complet vengeanc upon him who ha
commit such an offenc against me
hear thi sancho said to him your worship should bear in mind
seor don quixot that if the knight ha done what wa command him
in go to present himself befor my ladi dulcinea del toboso he will
have done all that he wa bound to do and doe not deserv further
punish unless he commit some new offenc
thou hast said well and hit the point answer don quixot and so i
recal the oath in so far as relat to take fresh vengeanc on him
but i make and confirm it anew to lead the life i have said until such
time as i take by forc from some knight anoth helmet such as thi
and as good and think not sancho that i am rais smoke with straw
in do so for i have on to imit in the matter sinc the veri
same thing to a hair happen in the case of mambrino helmet which
cost sacripant so dear
seor repli sancho let your worship send all such oath to the
devil for thei ar veri pernici to salvat and prejudici to the
conscienc just tell me now if for sever dai to come we fall in
with no man arm with a helmet what ar we to do is the oath to be
observ in spite of all the inconveni and discomfort it will be to
sleep in your cloth and not to sleep in a hous and a thousand
other mortif contain in the oath of that old fool the marqui
of mantua which your worship is now want to reviv let your
worship observ that there ar no men in armour travel on ani of
these road noth but carrier and carter who not onli do not wear
helmet but perhap never heard tell of them all their live
thou art wrong there said don quixot for we shall not have been
abov two hour among these crossroad befor we see more men in
armour than came to albraca to win the fair angelica
enough said sancho so be it then and god grant us success and
that the time for win that island which is cost me so dear mai
soon come and then let me die
i have alreadi told thee sancho said don quixot not to give
thyself ani uneasi on that score for if an island should fail
there is the kingdom of denmark or of sobradisa which will fit thee
as a ring fit the finger and all the more that be on terra
firma thou wilt all the better enjoi thyself but let us leav that
to it own time see if thou hast anyth for us to eat in those
alforja becaus we must present go in quest of some castl where we
mai lodg tonight and make the balsam i told thee of for i swear to
thee by god thi ear is give me great pain
i have here an onion and a littl chees and a few scrap of bread
said sancho but thei ar not victual fit for a valiant knight like
your worship
how littl thou knowest about it answer don quixot i would have
thee to know sancho that it is the glori of knightserr to go
without eat for a month and even when thei do eat that it should
be of what come first to hand and thi would have been clear to thee
hadst thou read as mani histori as i have for though thei ar veri
mani among them all i have found no mention made of knightserr
eat unless by accid or at some sumptuou banquet prepar for
them and the rest of the time thei pass in dallianc and though it
is plain thei could not do without eat and perform all the other
natur function becaus in fact thei were men like ourselv it
is plain too that wander as thei did the most part of their live
through wood and wild and without a cook their most usual fare would
be rustic viand such as those thou now offer me so that friend
sancho let not that distress thee which pleas me and do not seek to
make a new world or pervert knighterrantri
pardon me your worship said sancho for as i cannot read or
write as i said just now i neither know nor comprehend the rule of
the profess of chivalri henceforward i will stock the alforja with
everi kind of dry fruit for your worship as you ar a knight and for
myself as i am not on i will furnish them with poultri and other
thing more substanti
i do not sai sancho repli don quixot that it is imper on
knightserr not to eat anyth els but the fruit thou speakest
of onli that their more usual diet must be those and certain herb
thei found in the field which thei knew and i know too
a good thing it is answer sancho to know those herb for to my
think it will be need some dai to put that knowledg into
practic
and here take out what he said he had brought the pair made their
repast peaceabl and sociabl but anxiou to find quarter for the
night thei with all despatch made an end of their poor dry fare
mount at onc and made hast to reach some habit befor night
set in but daylight and the hope of succeed in their object fail
them close by the hut of some goatherd so thei determin to pass
the night there and it wa as much to sancho discont not to have
reach a hous as it wa to hi master satisfact to sleep under
the open heaven for he fanci that each time thi happen to him he
perform an act of ownership that help to prove hi chivalri

is to be told what i eat in my corner without form or fuss ha much

knightserr and all thei did wa to eat in silenc and stare at

i do not know what it is call repli pedro but i know that he
knew all thi and more besid but to make an end not mani month
had pass after he return from salamanca when on dai he appear
dress as a shepherd with hi crook and sheepskin have put off the
long gown he wore as a scholar and at the same time hi great friend
ambrosio by name who had been hi companion in hi studi took to
the shepherd dress with him i forgot to sai that chrysostom who is
dead wa a great man for write vers so much so that he made
carol for christma ev and plai for corpu christi which the young
men of our villag act and all said thei were excel when the
villag saw the two scholar so unexpectedli appear in shepherd
dress thei were lost in wonder and could not guess what had led them
to make so extraordinari a chang about thi time the father of our
chrysostom di and he wa left heir to a larg amount of properti in
chattel as well as in land no small number of cattl and sheep and a
larg sum of monei of all of which the young man wa left dissolut
owner and inde he wa deserv of it all for he wa a veri good
comrad and kindheart and a friend of worthi folk and had a
counten like a benedict present it came to be known that he
had chang hi dress with no other object than to wander about these
wast after that shepherdess marcela our lad mention a while ago
with whom the deceas chrysostom had fallen in love and i must tell
you now for it is well you should know it who thi girl is perhap
and even without ani perhap you will not have heard anyth like it
all the dai of your life though you should live more year than
sarna
sai sarra said don quixot unabl to endur the goatherd
confus of word
the sarna live long enough answer pedro and if seor you must
go find fault with word at everi step we shall not make an end of
it thi twelvemonth
pardon me friend said don quixot but as there is such a
differ between sarna and sarra i told you of it howev you have
answer veri rightli for sarna live longer than sarra so continu
your stori and i will not object ani more to anyth
i sai then my dear sir said the goatherd that in our villag
there wa a farmer even richer than the father of chrysostom who wa
name guillermo and upon whom god bestow over and abov great
wealth a daughter at whose birth her mother di the most respect
woman there wa in thi neighbourhood i fanci i can see her now with
that counten which had the sun on on side and the moon on the
other and moreov activ and kind to the poor for which i trust
that at the present moment her soul is in bliss with god in the other
world her husband guillermo di of grief at the death of so good a
wife leav hi daughter marcela a child and rich to the care of an
uncl of her a priest and prebendari in our villag the girl grew up
with such beauti that it remind us of her mother which wa veri
great and yet it wa thought that the daughter would exce it and
so when she reach the ag of fourteen to fifteen year nobodi beheld
her but bless god that had made her so beauti and the greater
number were in love with her past redempt her uncl kept her in
great seclus and retir but for all that the fame of her great
beauti spread so that as well for it as for her great wealth her
uncl wa ask solicit and importun to give her in marriag not
onli by those of our town but of those mani leagu round and by the
person of highest qualiti in them but he be a good christian man
though he desir to give her in marriag at onc see her to be old
enough wa unwil to do so without her consent not that he had ani
ey to the gain and profit which the custodi of the girl properti
brought him while he put off her marriag and faith thi wa said in
prais of the good priest in more than on set in the town for i would
have you know sir errant that in these littl villag everyth is
talk about and everyth is carp at and rest assur as i am
that the priest must be over and abov good who forc hi parishion
to speak well of him especi in villag
that is the truth said don quixot but go on for the stori is
veri good and you good pedro tell it with veri good grace
mai that of the lord not be want to me said pedro that is the
on to have to proce you must know that though the uncl put befor
hi niec and describ to her the qualiti of each on in particular
of the mani who had ask her in marriag beg her to marri and
make a choic accord to her own tast she never gave ani other
answer than that she had no desir to marri just yet and that be so
young she did not think herself fit to bear the burden of matrimoni at
these to all appear reason excus that she made her uncl
ceas to urg her and wait till she wa somewhat more advanc in
ag and could mate herself to her own like for said heand he said
quit rightpar ar not to settl children in life against their
will but when on least look for it lo and behold on dai the
demur marcela make her appear turn shepherdess and in spite
of her uncl and all those of the town that strove to dissuad her
took to go afield with the other shepherdlass of the villag
and tend her own flock and so sinc she appear in public and
her beauti came to be seen openli i could not well tell you how mani
rich youth gentlemen and peasant have adopt the costum of
chrysostom and go about these field make love to her on of these
as ha been alreadi said wa our deceas friend of whom thei sai
that he did not love but ador her but you must not suppos becaus
marcela chose a life of such liberti and independ and of so littl
or rather no retir that she ha given ani occas or even the
semblanc of on for disparag of her puriti and modesti on the
contrari such and so great is the vigil with which she watch
over her honour that of all those that court and woo her not on ha
boast or can with truth boast that she ha given him ani hope
howev small of obtain hi desir for although she doe not avoid
or shun the societi and convers of the shepherd and treat them
courteous and kindli should ani on of them come to declar hi
intent to her though it be on as proper and holi as that of
matrimoni she fling him from her like a catapult and with thi kind
of disposit she doe more harm in thi countri than if the plagu
had got into it for her affabl and her beauti draw on the heart
of those that associ with her to love her and to court her but her
scorn and her frank bring them to the brink of despair and so thei
know not what to sai save to proclaim her aloud cruel and hardheart
and other name of the same sort which well describ the natur of her
charact and if you should remain here ani time seor you would
hear these hill and vallei resound with the lament of the
reject on who pursu her not far from thi there is a spot where
there ar a coupl of dozen of tall beech and there is not on of
them but ha carv and written on it smooth bark the name of marcela
and abov some a crown carv on the same tree as though her lover
would sai more plainli that marcela wore and deserv that of all human
beauti here on shepherd is sigh there anoth is lament there
love song ar heard here despair elegi on will pass all the
hour of the night seat at the foot of some oak or rock and there
without have close hi weep ey the sun find him in the
morn bemus and bereft of sens and anoth without relief or
respit to hi sigh stretch on the burn sand in the full heat of
the sultri summer noontid make hi appeal to the compassion
heaven and over on and the other over these and all the beauti
marcela triumph free and careless and all of us that know her ar
wait to see what her pride will come to and who is to be the happi
man that will succe in tame a natur so formid and gain
possess of a beauti so suprem all that i have told you be such
wellestablish truth i am persuad that what thei sai of the caus
of chrysostom death as our lad told us is the same and so i advis
you seor fail not to be present tomorrow at hi burial which will
be well worth see for chrysostom had mani friend and it is not
half a leagu from thi place to where he direct he should be
buri
i will make a point of it said don quixot and i thank you for the
pleasur you have given me by relat so interest a tale
oh said the goatherd i do not know even the half of what ha
happen to the lover of marcela but perhap tomorrow we mai fall in
with some shepherd on the road who can tell us and now it will be well
for you to go and sleep under cover for the night air mai hurt your
wound though with the remedi i have appli to you there is no fear of
an untoward result
sancho panza who wa wish the goatherd loquac at the devil on
hi part beg hi master to go into pedro hut to sleep he did so
and pass all the rest of the night in think of hi ladi dulcinea
in imit of the lover of marcela sancho panza settl himself
between rocinant and hi ass and slept not like a lover who had been

but hardli had dai begun to show itself through the balconi of the
east when five of the six goatherd came to rous don quixot and tell
him that if he wa still of a mind to go and see the famou burial of
chrysostom thei would bear him compani don quixot who desir
noth better rose and order sancho to saddl and pannel at onc
which he did with all despatch and with the same thei all set out
forthwith thei had not gone a quarter of a leagu when at the meet
of two path thei saw come toward them some six shepherd dress in
black sheepskin and with their head crown with garland of cypress
and bitter oleand each of them carri a stout holli staff in hi
hand and along with them there came two men of qualiti on horseback in
handsom travel dress with three servant on foot accompani
them courteou salut were exchang on meet and inquir
on of the other which wai each parti wa go thei learn that all
were bound for the scene of the burial so thei went on all togeth
on of those on horseback address hi companion said to him it
seem to me seor vivaldo that we mai reckon as well spent the delai
we shall incur in see thi remark funer for remark it
cannot but be judg by the strang thing these shepherd have told
us of both the dead shepherd and homicid shepherdess
so i think too repli vivaldo and i would delai not to sai a dai
but four for the sake of see it
don quixot ask them what it wa thei had heard of marcela and
chrysostom the travel answer that the same morn thei had met
these shepherd and see them dress in thi mourn fashion thei
had ask them the reason of their appear in such a guis which on
of them gave describ the strang behaviour and beauti of a
shepherdess call marcela and the love of mani who court her
togeth with the death of that chrysostom to whose burial thei were
go in short he repeat all that pedro had relat to don quixot
thi convers drop and anoth wa commenc by him who wa
call vivaldo ask don quixot what wa the reason that led him to
go arm in that fashion in a countri so peac to which don quixot
repli the pursuit of my call doe not allow or permit me to go
in ani other fashion easi life enjoy and repos were invent
for soft courtier but toil unrest and arm were invent and made
for those alon whom the world call knightserr of whom i though
unworthi am the least of all
the instant thei heard thi all set him down as mad and the better to
settl the point and discov what kind of mad hi wa vivaldo
proceed to ask him what knightserr meant
have not your worship repli don quixot read the annal and
histori of england in which ar record the famou deed of king
arthur whom we in our popular castilian invari call king artu
with regard to whom it is an ancient tradit and commonli receiv
all over that kingdom of great britain that thi king did not die but
wa chang by magic art into a raven and that in process of time he
is to return to reign and recov hi kingdom and sceptr for which
reason it cannot be prove that from that time to thi ani englishman
ever kill a raven well then in the time of thi good king that
famou order of chivalri of the knight of the round tabl wa
institut and the amour of don lancelot of the lake with the queen
guinever occur precis as is there relat the gobetween and
confidant therein be the highli honour dame quintaona whenc
came that ballad so well known and wide spread in our spain
o never sure wa there knight
so serv by hand of dame
as serv wa he sir lancelot hight
when he from britain came
with all the sweet and delect cours of hi achiev in love
and war hand down from that time then thi order of chivalri went
on extend and spread itself over mani and variou part of the
world and in it famou and renown for their deed were the mighti
amadi of gaul with all hi son and descend to the fifth
gener and the valiant felixmart of hircania and the never
suffici prais tirant el blanco and in our own dai almost we
have seen and heard and talk with the invinc knight don beliani
of greec thi then sir is to be a knighterr and what i have
spoken of is the order of hi chivalri of which as i have alreadi
said i though a sinner have made profess and what the aforesaid
knight profess that same do i profess and so i go through these
solitud and wild seek adventur resolv in soul to oppos my
arm and person to the most peril that fortun mai offer me in aid of
the weak and needi
by these word of hi the travel were abl to satisfi themselv of
don quixot be out of hi sens and of the form of mad that
overmast him at which thei felt the same astonish that all
felt on first becom acquaint with it and vivaldo who wa a
person of great shrewd and of a live tempera in order to
beguil the short journei which thei said wa requir to reach the
mountain the scene of the burial sought to give him an opportun of
go on with hi absurd so he said to him it seem to me
seor knighterr that your worship ha made choic of on of the
most auster profess in the world and i imagin even that of the
carthusian monk is not so auster
as auster it mai perhap be repli our don quixot but so
necessari for the world i am veri much inclin to doubt for if the
truth is to be told the soldier who execut what hi captain order
doe no less than the captain himself who give the order my mean
is that churchmen in peac and quiet prai to heaven for the welfar of
the world but we soldier and knight carri into effect what thei prai
for defend it with the might of our arm and the edg of our
sword not under shelter but in the open air a target for the
intoler rai of the sun in summer and the pierc frost of
winter thu ar we god minist on earth and the arm by which hi
justic is done therein and as the busi of war and all that
relat and belong to it cannot be conduct without exceed great
sweat toil and exert it follow that those who make it their
profess have undoubtedli more labour than those who in tranquil
peac and quiet ar engag in prai to god to help the weak i do
not mean to sai nor doe it enter into my thought that the
knighterr call is as good as that of the monk in hi cell i
would mere infer from what i endur myself that it is beyond a doubt
a more labori and a more belabour on a hungrier and thirstier a
wretched ragged and lousier for there is no reason to doubt that
the knightserr of yore endur much hardship in the cours of their
live and if some of them by the might of their arm did rise to be
emperor in faith it cost them dear in the matter of blood and sweat
and if those who attain to that rank had not had magician and sage
to help them thei would have been complet baulk in their ambit
and disappoint in their hope
that is my own opinion repli the travel but on thing among
mani other seem to me veri wrong in knightserr and that is that
when thei find themselv about to engag in some mighti and peril
adventur in which there is manifest danger of lose their live thei
never at the moment of engag in it think of commend themselv to
god as is the duti of everi good christian in like peril instead of
which thei commend themselv to their ladi with as much devot as
if these were their god a thing which seem to me to savour somewhat
of heathen
sir answer don quixot that cannot be on ani account omit
and the knighterr would be disgrac who act otherwis for it is
usual and customari in knighterrantri that the knighterr who on
engag in ani great feat of arm ha hi ladi befor him should turn
hi ey toward her softli and lovingli as though with them
entreat her to favour and protect him in the hazard ventur he is
about to undertak and even though no on hear him he is bound to sai
certain word between hi teeth commend himself to her with all hi
heart and of thi we have innumer instanc in the histori nor
is it to be suppos from thi that thei ar to omit commend
themselv to god for there will be time and opportun for do so
while thei ar engag in their task
for all that answer the travel i feel some doubt still
becaus often i have read how word will aris between two
knightserr and from on thing to anoth it come about that their
anger kindl and thei wheel their hors round and take a good stretch
of field and then without ani more ado at the top of their speed thei
come to the charg and in midcar thei ar wont to commend
themselv to their ladi and what commonli come of the encount is
that on fall over the haunch of hi hors pierc through and
through by hi antagonist lanc and as for the other it is onli by
hold on to the mane of hi hors that he can help fall to the
ground but i know not how the dead man had time to commend himself to
god in the cours of such rapid work as thi it would have been better
if those word which he spent in commend himself to hi ladi in the
midst of hi career had been devot to hi duti and oblig as a
christian moreov it is my belief that all knightserr have not
ladi to commend themselv to for thei ar not all in love
that is imposs said don quixot i sai it is imposs that
there could be a knighterr without a ladi becaus to such it is as
natur and proper to be in love as to the heaven to have star most
certainli no histori ha been seen in which there is to be found a
knighterr without an amour and for the simpl reason that without
on he would be held no legitim knight but a bastard and on who
had gain entranc into the stronghold of the said knighthood not by
the door but over the wall like a thief and a robber
nevertheless said the travel if i rememb rightli i think i
have read that don galaor the brother of the valiant amadi of gaul
never had ani special ladi to whom he might commend himself and yet he
wa not the less esteem and wa a veri stout and famou knight
to which our don quixot made answer sir on solitari swallow doe
not make summer moreov i know that knight wa in secret veri deepli
in love besid which that wai of fall in love with all that took
hi fanci wa a natur propens which he could not control but in
short it is veri manifest that he had on alon whom he made mistress
of hi will to whom he commend himself veri frequent and veri
secretli for he pride himself on be a retic knight
then if it be essenti that everi knighterr should be in love
said the travel it mai be fairli suppos that your worship is so
as you ar of the order and if you do not pride yourself on be as
retic as don galaor i entreat you as earnestli as i can in the
name of all thi compani and in my own to inform us of the name
countri rank and beauti of your ladi for she will esteem herself
fortun if all the world know that she is love and serv by such a
knight as your worship seem to be
at thi don quixot heav a deep sigh and said i cannot sai
posit whether my sweet enemi is pleas or not that the world
should know i serv her i can onli sai in answer to what ha been so
courteous ask of me that her name is dulcinea her countri el
toboso a villag of la mancha her rank must be at least that of a
princess sinc she is my queen and ladi and her beauti superhuman
sinc all the imposs and fanci attribut of beauti which the
poet appli to their ladi ar verifi in her for her hair ar
gold her forehead elysian field her eyebrow rainbow her ey
sun her cheek rose her lip coral her teeth pearl her neck
alabast her bosom marbl her hand ivori her fair snow and
what modesti conceal from sight such i think and imagin as ration
reflect can onli extol not compar
we should like to know her lineag race and ancestri said vivaldo
to which don quixot repli she is not of the ancient roman curtii
caii or scipio nor of the modern colonna or orsini nor of the
moncada or requesen of catalonia nor yet of the rebella or
villanova of valencia palafox nuza rocaberti corella luna
alagon urrea foce or gurrea of aragon cerda manriqu
mendoza or guzman of castil alencastro palla or menes of
portug but she is of those of el toboso of la mancha a lineag that
though modern mai furnish a sourc of gentl blood for the most
illustri famili of the ag that ar to come and thi let none
disput with me save on the condit that zerbino place at the foot
of the trophi of orlando arm sai
these let none move
who dareth not hi might with roland prove
although mine is of the cachopin of laredo said the travel i
will not ventur to compar it with that of el toboso of la mancha
though to tell the truth no such surnam ha until now ever reach
my ear
what said don quixot ha that never reach them
the rest of the parti went along listen with great attent to the
convers of the pair and even the veri goatherd and shepherd
perceiv how exceedingli out of hi wit our don quixot wa sancho
panza alon thought that what hi master said wa the truth know
who he wa and have known him from hi birth and all that he felt
ani difficulti in believ wa that about the fair dulcinea del
toboso becaus neither ani such name nor ani such princess had ever
come to hi knowledg though he live so close to el toboso thei were
go along convers in thi wai when thei saw descend a gap
between two high mountain some twenti shepherd all clad in
sheepskin of black wool and crown with garland which as
afterward appear were some of them of yew some of cypress six of
the number were carri a bier cover with a great varieti of flower
and branch on see which on of the goatherd said those who
come there ar the bearer of chrysostom bodi and the foot of that
mountain is the place where he order them to buri him thei
therefor made hast to reach the spot and did so by the time those
who came had laid the bier upon the ground and four of them with sharp
pickax were dig a grave by the side of a hard rock thei greet
each other courteous and then don quixot and those who accompani
him turn to examin the bier and on it cover with flower thei
saw a dead bodi in the dress of a shepherd to all appear of on
thirti year of ag and show even in death that in life he had been
of come featur and gallant bear around him on the bier itself
were laid some book and sever paper open and fold and those who
were look on as well as those who were open the grave and all the
other who were there preserv a strang silenc until on of those
who had born the bodi said to anoth observ carefulli ambrosio if
thi is the place chrysostom spoke of sinc you ar anxiou that what
he direct in hi will should be so strictli compli with
thi is the place answer ambrosio for in it mani a time did my
poor friend tell me the stori of hi hard fortun here it wa he told
me that he saw for the first time that mortal enemi of the human race
and here too for the first time he declar to her hi passion as
honour as it wa devot and here it wa that at last marcela
end by scorn and reject him so as to bring the tragedi of hi
wretch life to a close here in memori of misfortun so great he
desir to be laid in the bowel of etern oblivion then turn to
don quixot and the travel he went on to sai that bodi sir on
which you ar look with compassion ey wa the abod of a soul
on which heaven bestow a vast share of it rich that is the bodi
of chrysostom who wa unrival in wit unequal in courtesi
unapproach in gentl bear a phnix in friendship gener
without limit grave without arrog gai without vulgar and in
short first in all that constitut good and second to none in all
that make up misfortun he love deepli he wa hate he ador he
wa scorn he woo a wild beast he plead with marbl he pursu
the wind he cri to the wilder he serv ingratitud and for
reward wa made the prei of death in the midcours of life cut short
by a shepherdess whom he sought to immortalis in the memori of man as
these paper which you see could fulli prove had he not command me
to consign them to the fire after have consign hi bodi to the
earth
you would deal with them more harshli and cruelli than their owner
himself said vivaldo for it is neither right nor proper to do the
will of on who enjoin what is wholli unreason it would not have
been reason in augustu csar had he permit the direct left
by the divin mantuan in hi will to be carri into effect so that
seor ambrosio while you consign your friend bodi to the earth you
should not consign hi write to oblivion for if he gave the order
in bitter of heart it is not right that you should irration
obei it on the contrari by grant life to those paper let the
cruelti of marcela live for ever to serv as a warn in ag to come
to all men to shun and avoid fall into like danger or i and all of
us who have come here know alreadi the stori of thi your lovestricken
and heartbroken friend and we know too your friendship and the
caus of hi death and the direct he gave at the close of hi
life from which sad stori mai be gather how great wa the cruelti of
marcela the love of chrysostom and the loyalti of your friendship
togeth with the end await those who pursu rashli the path that
insan passion open to their ey last night we learn the death of
chrysostom and that he wa to be buri here and out of curios and
piti we left our direct road and resolv to come and see with our ey
that which when heard of had so move our compass and in
consider of that compass and our desir to prove it if we might
by condol we beg of you excel ambrosio or at least i on my
own account entreat you that instead of burn those paper you allow

the lai of chrysostom
sinc thou dost in thy cruelti desir
the ruthless rigour of thy tyranni
from tongu to tongu from land to land proclaim
the veri hell will i constrain to lend
thi stricken breast of mine deep note of woe
to serv my need of fit utter
and as i strive to bodi forth the tale
of all i suffer all that thou hast done
forth shall the dread voic roll and bear along
shred from my vital torn for greater pain
then listen not to dulcet harmoni
but to a discord wrung by mad despair
out of thi bosom depth of bitter
to eas my heart and plant a sting in thine
the lion roar the fierc wolf savag howl
the horrid hiss of the scali snake
the awesom cri of monster yet unnam
the crow illbod croak the hollow moan
of wild wind wrestl with the restless sea
the wrath bellow of the vanquish bull
the plaintiv sob of the widow dove
the envi owl sad note the wail of woe
that rise from the dreari choir of hell
commingl in on sound confus sens
let all these come to aid my soul complaint
for pain like mine demand new mode of song
no echo of that discord shall be heard
where father tagu roll or on the bank
of olivebord beti to the rock
or in deep cavern shall my plaint be told
and by a lifeless tongu in live word
or in dark vallei or on lone shore
where neither foot of man nor sunbeam fall
or in among the poisonbreath swarm
of monster nourish by the sluggish nile
for though it be to solitud remot
the hoars vagu echo of my sorrow sound
thy matchless cruelti my dismal fate
shall carri them to all the spaciou world
disdain hath power to kill and patienc di
slain by suspicion be it fals or true
and deadli is the forc of jealousi
long absenc make of life a dreari void
no hope of happi can give repos
to him that ever fear to be forgot
and death inevit wait in hall
but i by some strang miracl live on
a prei to absenc jealousi disdain
rack by suspicion as by certainti
forgotten left to feed my flame alon
and while i suffer thu there come no rai
of hope to gladden me athwart the gloom
nor do i look for it in my despair
but rather cling to a cureless woe
all hope do i abjur for evermor
can there be hope where fear is were it well
when far more certain ar the ground of fear
ought i to shut mine ey to jealousi
if through a thousand heartwound it appear
who would not give free access to distrust
see disdain unveil andbitt chang
all hi suspicion turn to certainti
and the fair truth transform into a lie
oh thou fierc tyrant of the realm of love
oh jealousi put chain upon these hand
and bind me with thy strongest cord disdain
but woe is me triumphant over all
my suffer drown the memori of you
and now i die and sinc there is no hope
of happi for me in life or death
still to my fantasi ill fondli cling
ill sai that he is wise who loveth well
and that the soul most free is that most bound
in thraldom to the ancient tyrant love
ill sai that she who is mine enemi
in that fair bodi hath as fair a mind
and that her cold is but my desert
and that by virtu of the pain he send
love rule hi kingdom with a gentl swai
thu selfdelud and in bondag sore
and wear out the wretch shred of life
to which i am reduc by her disdain
ill give thi soul and bodi to the wind
all hopeless of a crown of bliss in store
thou whose injustic hath suppli the caus
that make me quit the weari life i loath
as by thi wound bosom thou canst see
how willingli thy victim i becom
let not my death if hapli worth a tear
cloud the clear heaven that dwell in thy bright ey
i would not have thee expiat in aught
the crime of have made my heart thy prei
but rather let thy laughter gaili ring
and prove my death to be thy festiv
fool that i am to bid thee well i know
thy glori gain by my untim end
and now it is the time from hell abyss
come thirst tantalu come sisyphu
heav the cruel stone come tityu
with vultur and with wheel ixion come
and come the sister of the ceaseless toil
and all into thi breast transfer their pain
and if such tribut to despair be due
chant in their deepest tone a dole dirg
over a cors unworthi of a shroud
let the threehead guardian of the gate
and all the monstrou progeni of hell
the dole concert join a lover dead
methink can have no fitter obsequi
lai of despair griev not when thou art gone
forth from thi sorrow heart my miseri
bring fortun to the caus that gave thee birth
then banish sad even in the tomb
the lai of chrysostom met with the approb of the listen
though the reader said it did not seem to him to agre with what he had
heard of marcela reserv and proprieti for chrysostom complain in
it of jealousi suspicion and absenc all to the prejudic of the
good name and fame of marcela to which ambrosio repli as on who
knew well hi friend most secret thought seor to remov that
doubt i should tell you that when the unhappi man wrote thi lai he wa
awai from marcela from whom he had voluntarili separ himself to
try if absenc would act with him as it is wont and as everyth
distress and everi fear haunt the banish lover so imaginari
jealousi and suspicion dread as if thei were true torment
chrysostom and thu the truth of what report declar of the virtu of
marcela remain unshaken and with her envi itself should not and
cannot find ani fault save that of be cruel somewhat haughti and
veri scorn
that is true said vivaldo and as he wa about to read anoth paper
of those he had preserv from the fire he wa stop by a marvel
vision for such it seem that unexpectedli present itself to their
ey for on the summit of the rock where thei were dig the grave
there appear the shepherdess marcela so beauti that her beauti
exceed it reput those who had never till then beheld her gaze
upon her in wonder and silenc and those who were accustom to see
her were not less amaz than those who had never seen her befor but
the instant ambrosio saw her he address her with manifest
indign
art thou come by chanc cruel basilisk of these mountain to see if
in thy presenc blood will flow from the wound of thi wretch be
thy cruelti ha rob of life or is it to exult over the cruel work
of thy humour that thou art come or like anoth pitiless nero to
look down from that height upon the ruin of hi rome in ember or in
thy arrog to trampl on thi illfat corps as the ungrat
daughter trampl on her father tarquin tell us quickli for what
thou art come or what it is thou wouldst have for as i know the
thought of chrysostom never fail to obei thee in life i will make
all these who call themselv hi friend obei thee though he be
dead
i come not ambrosio for ani of the purpos thou hast name repli
marcela but to defend myself and to prove how unreason ar all
those who blame me for their sorrow and for chrysostom death and
therefor i ask all of you that ar here to give me your attent for
it will not take much time or mani word to bring the truth home to
person of sens heaven ha made me so you sai beauti and so
much so that in spite of yourselv my beauti lead you to love me and
for the love you show me you sai and even urg that i am bound to
love you by that natur understand which god ha given me i know
that everyth beauti attract love but i cannot see how by
reason of be love that which is love for it beauti is bound to
love that which love it besid it mai happen that the lover of that
which is beauti mai be ugli and ugli be detest it is
veri absurd to sai i love thee becaus thou art beauti thou must
love me though i be ugli but suppos the beauti equal on both
side it doe not follow that the inclin must be therefor
alik for it is not everi beauti that excit love some but pleas
the ey without win the affect and if everi sort of beauti
excit love and won the heart the will would wander vagu to and
fro unabl to make choic of ani for as there is an infin of
beauti object there must be an infin of inclin and true
love i have heard it said is indivis and must be voluntari and
not compel if thi be so as i believ it to be why do you desir
me to bend my will by forc for no other reason but that you sai you
love me naytel mehad heaven made me ugli as it ha made me
beauti could i with justic complain of you for not love me
moreov you must rememb that the beauti i possess wa no choic of
mine for be it what it mai heaven of it bounti gave it me without
my ask or choos it and as the viper though it kill with it
doe not deserv to be blame for the poison it carri as it is a
gift of natur neither do i deserv reproach for be beauti for
beauti in a modest woman is like fire at a distanc or a sharp sword
the on doe not burn the other doe not cut those who do not come
too near honour and virtu ar the ornament of the mind without
which the bodi though it be so ha no right to pass for beauti
but if modesti is on of the virtu that special lend a grace and
charm to mind and bodi why should she who is love for her beauti part
with it to gratifi on who for hi pleasur alon strive with all hi
might and energi to rob her of it i wa born free and that i might
live in freedom i chose the solitud of the field in the tree of the
mountain i find societi the clear water of the brook ar my
mirror and to the tree and water i make known my thought and
charm i am a fire afar off a sword laid asid those whom i have
inspir with love by let them see me i have by word undeceiv
and if their long live on hopeand i have given none to chrysostom
or to ani otherit cannot justli be said that the death of ani is my
do for it wa rather hi own obstinaci than my cruelti that kill
him and if it be made a charg against me that hi wish were
honour and that therefor i wa bound to yield to them i answer
that when on thi veri spot where now hi grave is made he declar to
me hi puriti of purpos i told him that mine wa to live in perpetu
solitud and that the earth alon should enjoi the fruit of my
retir and the spoil of my beauti and if after thi open avow
he chose to persist against hope and steer against the wind what
wonder is it that he should sink in the depth of hi infatu if i
had encourag him i should be fals if i had gratifi him i should
have act against my own better resolut and purpos he wa
persist in spite of warn he despair without be hate
bethink you now if it be reason that hi suffer should be laid
to my charg let him who ha been deceiv complain let him give wai
to despair whose encourag hope have prove vain let him flatter
himself whom i shall entic let him boast whom i shall receiv but
let not him call me cruel or homicid to whom i make no promis upon
whom i practis no decept whom i neither entic nor receiv it ha
not been so far the will of heaven that i should love by fate and to
expect me to love by choic is idl let thi gener declar serv
for each of my suitor on hi own account and let it be understood
from thi time forth that if anyon di for me it is not of jealousi
or miseri he di for she who love no on can give no caus for
jealousi to ani and candour is not to be confound with scorn let
him who call me wild beast and basilisk leav me alon as someth
noxiou and evil let him who call me ungrat withhold hi
servic who call me wayward seek not my acquaint who call me
cruel pursu me not for thi wild beast thi basilisk thi
ungrat cruel wayward be ha no kind of desir to seek serv
know or follow them if chrysostom impati and violent passion
kill him why should my modest behaviour and circumspect be
blame if i preserv my puriti in the societi of the tree why should
he who would have me preserv it among men seek to rob me of it i
have as you know wealth of my own and i covet not that of other my
tast is for freedom and i have no relish for constraint i neither
love nor hate anyon i do not deceiv thi on or court that or
trifl with on or plai with anoth the modest convers of the
shepherd girl of these hamlet and the care of my goat ar my
recreat my desir ar bound by these mountain and if thei
ever wander henc it is to contempl the beauti of the heaven step
by which the soul travel to it primev abod
with these word and not wait to hear a repli she turn and
pass into the thickest part of a wood that wa hard by leav all
who were there lost in admir as much of her good sens as of her
beauti somethos wound by the irresist shaft launch by her
bright eyesmad as though thei would follow her heedless of the frank
declar thei had heard see which and deem thi a fit
occas for the exercis of hi chivalri in aid of distress damsel
don quixot lai hi hand on the hilt of hi sword exclaim in a
loud and distinct voic
let no on whatev hi rank or condit dare to follow the
beauti marcela under pain of incur my fierc indign she
ha shown by clear and satisfactori argument that littl or no fault
is to be found with her for the death of chrysostom and also how far
she is from yield to the wish of ani of her lover for which
reason instead of be follow and persecut she should in justic
be honour and esteem by all the good peopl of the world for she
show that she is the onli woman in it that hold to such a virtuou
resolut
whether it wa becaus of the threat of don quixot or becaus
ambrosio told them to fulfil their duti to their good friend none of
the shepherd move or stir from the spot until have finish the
grave and burn chrysostom paper thei laid hi bodi in it not
without mani tear from those who stood by thei close the grave with
a heavi stone until a slab wa readi which ambrosio said he meant to
have prepar with an epitaph which wa to be to thi effect
beneath the stone befor your ey
the bodi of a lover li
in life he wa a shepherd swain
in death a victim to disdain
ungrat cruel coi and fair
wa she that drove him to despair
and love hath made her hi alli

thei then strew upon the grave a profus of flower and branch
and all express their condol with hi friend ambrosio took
their leav vivaldo and hi companion did the same and don quixot
bade farewel to hi host and to the travel who press him to
come with them to sevil as be such a conveni place for find

everi corner often than anywher els don quixot thank them for
their advic and for the disposit thei show to do him a favour

travel were unwil to press him further and onc more bid
him farewel thei left him and pursu their journei in the cours of
which thei did not fail to discuss the stori of marcela and chrysostom

than two hour in all direct in search of her without find her
thei came to a halt in a glade cover with tender grass besid which
ran a pleasant cool stream that invit and compel them to pass
there the hour of the noontid heat which by thi time wa begin
to come on oppress don quixot and sancho dismount and turn

peacefulli and sociabl master and man made their repast on what thei

sancho had not thought it worth while to hobbl rocinant feel
sure from what he knew of hi staid and freedom from incontin
that all the mare in the cordova pastur would not lead him into an
improprieti chanc howev and the devil who is not alwai asleep
so ordain it that feed in thi vallei there wa a drove of
galician poni belong to certain yanguesan carrier whose wai it
is to take their middai rest with their team in place and spot where
grass and water abound and that where don quixot chanc to be suit
the yanguesan purpos veri well it so happen then that rocinant
took a fanci to disport himself with their ladyship the poni and
abandon hi usual gait and demeanour as he scent them he without
ask leav of hi master got up a briskish littl trot and hasten
to make known hi wish to them thei howev it seem prefer
their pastur to him and receiv him with their heel and teeth to
such effect that thei soon broke hi girth and left him nake without
a saddl to cover him but what must have been wors to him wa that
the carrier see the violenc he wa offer to their mare came
run up arm with stake and so belabour him that thei brought
him sore batter to the ground
by thi time don quixot and sancho who had wit the drub of
rocinant came up pant and said don quixot to sancho
so far as i can see friend sancho these ar not knight but base
folk of low birth i mention it becaus thou canst lawfulli aid me in
take due vengeanc for the insult offer to rocinant befor our
ey
what the devil vengeanc can we take answer sancho if thei ar
more than twenti and we no more than two or inde perhap not more
than on and a half
i count for a hundr repli don quixot and without more word he
drew hi sword and attack the yanguesan and excit and impel by
the exampl of hi master sancho did the same and to begin with don
quixot deliv a slash at on of them that laid open the leather
jerkin he wore togeth with a great portion of hi shoulder the
yanguesan see themselv assault by onli two men while thei were
so mani betook themselv to their stake and drive the two into
the middl thei began to lai on with great zeal and energi in fact at
the second blow thei brought sancho to the ground and don quixot
fare the same wai all hi skill and high mettl avail him noth
and fate will it that he should fall at the feet of rocinant who
had not yet risen wherebi it mai be seen how furious stake can
pound in angri boorish hand

then see the mischief thei had done the yanguesan with all the
hast thei could load their team and pursu their journei leav
the two adventur a sorri sight and in sorrier mood
sancho wa the first to come to and find himself close to hi
master he call to him in a weak and dole voic seor don
quixot ah seor don quixot
what wouldst thou brother sancho answer don quixot in the same
feebl suffer tone as sancho
i would like if it were possibl answer sancho panza your
worship to give me a coupl of sup of that potion of the fieri bla
if it be that you have ani to hand there perhap it will serv for
broken bone as well as for wound
if i onli had it here wretch that i am what more should we want
said don quixot but i swear to thee sancho panza on the faith of a
knighterr er two dai ar over unless fortun order otherwis
i mean to have it in my possess or my hand will have lost it
cun
but in how mani doe your worship think we shall have the us of our
feet answer sancho panza
for myself i must sai i cannot guess how mani said the batter
knight don quixot but i take all the blame upon myself for i had no
busi to put hand to sword against men who where not dub knight
like myself and so i believ that in punish for have
transgress the law of chivalri the god of battl ha permit thi
chastis to be administ to me for which reason brother
sancho it is well thou shouldst receiv a hint on the matter which i
am now about to mention to thee for it is of much import to the
welfar of both of us it is that when thou shalt see rabbl of thi
sort offer us insult thou art not to wait till i draw sword against
them for i shall not do so at all but do thou draw sword and chastis
them to thy heart content and if ani knight come to their aid and
defenc i will take care to defend thee and assail them with all my
might and thou hast alreadi seen by a thousand sign and proof what
the might of thi strong arm of mine is equal toso uplift had the
poor gentleman becom through the victori over the stout biscayan
but sancho did not so fulli approv of hi master admonit as to
let it pass without sai in repli seor i am a man of peac meek
and quiet and i can put up with ani affront becaus i have a wife and
children to support and bring up so let it be likewis a hint to your
worship as it cannot be a mandat that on no account will i draw
sword either against clown or against knight and that here befor god
i forgiv the insult that have been offer me whether thei have
been ar or shall be offer me by high or low rich or poor nobl
or common not except ani rank or condit whatsoev
to all which hi master said in repli i wish i had breath enough to
speak somewhat easili and that the pain i feel on thi side would
abat so as to let me explain to thee panza the mistak thou makest
come now sinner suppos the wind of fortun hitherto so advers
should turn in our favour fill the sail of our desir so that
safe and without impedi we put into port in some on of those
island i have promis thee how would it be with thee if on win
it i made thee lord of it why thou wilt make it wellnigh imposs
through not be a knight nor have ani desir to be on nor
possess the courag nor the will to aveng insult or defend thy
lordship for thou must know that in newli conquer kingdom and
provinc the mind of the inhabit ar never so quiet nor so well
dispos to the new lord that there is no fear of their make some
move to chang matter onc more and try as thei sai what chanc mai
do for them so it is essenti that the new possessor should have good
sens to enabl him to govern and valour to attack and defend himself
whatev mai befal him
in what ha now befallen us answer sancho id have been well
pleas to have that good sens and that valour your worship speak of
but i swear on the faith of a poor man i am more fit for plaster than
for argument see if your worship can get up and let us help
rocinant though he doe not deserv it for he wa the main caus of
all thi thrash i never thought it of rocinant for i took him to
be a virtuou person and as quiet as myself after all thei sai right
that it take a long time to come to know peopl and that there is
noth sure in thi life who would have said that after such mighti
slash as your worship gave that unlucki knighterr there wa
come travel post and at the veri heel of them such a great
storm of stick as ha fallen upon our shoulder
and yet thine sancho repli don quixot ought to be us to such
squall but mine rear in soft cloth and fine linen it is plain
thei must feel more keenli the pain of thi mishap and if it were not
that i imaginewhi do i sai imagineknow of a certainti that all these
annoy ar veri necessari accompani of the call of arm i
would lai me down here to die of pure vexat
to thi the squir repli seor as these mishap ar what on reap
of chivalri tell me if thei happen veri often or if thei have their
own fix time for come to pass becaus it seem to me that after
two harvest we shall be no good for the third unless god in hi
infinit merci help us
know friend sancho answer don quixot that the life of
knightserr is subject to a thousand danger and revers and
neither more nor less is it within immedi possibl for
knightserr to becom king and emperor as experi ha shown in
the case of mani differ knight with whose histori i am thoroughli
acquaint and i could tell thee now if the pain would let me of
some who simpli by might of arm have risen to the high station i have
mention and those same both befor and after experienc diver
misfortun and miseri for the valiant amadi of gaul found himself
in the power of hi mortal enemi arcalau the magician who it is
posit assert hold him captiv gave him more than two
hundr lash with the rein of hi hors while ti to on of the
pillar of a court and moreov there is a certain recondit author of
no small author who sai that the knight of phbu be caught in
a certain pitfal which open under hi feet in a certain castl on
fall found himself bound hand and foot in a deep pit underground
where thei administ to him on of those thing thei call clyster
of sand and snowwat that wellnigh finish him and if he had not
been succour in that sore extrem by a sage a great friend of hi
it would have gone veri hard with the poor knight so i mai well suffer
in compani with such worthi folk for greater were the indign
which thei had to suffer than those which we suffer for i would have
thee know sancho that wound caus by ani instrument which happen
by chanc to be in hand inflict no indign and thi is laid down in
the law of the duel in express word if for instanc the cobbler
strike anoth with the last which he ha in hi hand though it be in
fact a piec of wood it cannot be said for that reason that he whom he
struck with it ha been cudgel i sai thi lest thou shouldst
imagin that becaus we have been drub in thi affrai we have
therefor suffer ani indign for the arm those men carri with
which thei pound us were noth more than their stake and not on
of them so far as i rememb carri rapier sword or dagger
thei gave me no time to see that much answer sancho for hardli
had i laid hand on my tizona when thei sign the cross on my shoulder
with their stick in such style that thei took the sight out of my ey
and the strength out of my feet stretch me where i now lie and
where think of whether all those stakestrok were an indign or
not give me no uneasi which the pain of the blow doe for thei
will remain as deepli impress on my memori as on my shoulder
for all that let me tell thee brother panza said don quixot that
there is no recollect which time doe not put an end to and no pain
which death doe not remov
and what greater misfortun can there be repli panza than the
on that wait for time to put an end to it and death to remov it if
our mishap were on of those that ar cure with a coupl of plaster
it would not be so bad but i am begin to think that all the
plaster in a hospit almost wont be enough to put us right
no more of that pluck strength out of weak sancho as i mean to
do return don quixot and let us see how rocinant is for it
seem to me that not the least share of thi mishap ha fallen to the
lot of the poor beast
there is noth wonder in that repli sancho sinc he is a
knighterr too what i wonder at is that my beast should have come
off scotfre where we come out scotch
fortun alwai leav a door open in advers in order to bring
relief to it said don quixot i sai so becaus thi littl beast
mai now suppli the want of rocinant carri me henc to some castl
where i mai be cure of my wound and moreov i shall not hold it ani
dishonour to be so mount for i rememb have read how the good old
silenu the tutor and instructor of the gai god of laughter when he
enter the citi of the hundr gate went veri contentedli mount on
a handsom ass
it mai be true that he went mount as your worship sai answer
sancho but there is a great differ between go mount and
go slung like a sack of manur
to which don quixot repli wound receiv in battl confer honour
instead of take it awai and so friend panza sai no more but as i
told thee befor get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy
beast in whatev fashion pleas thee best and let us go henc er
night come on and surpris us in these wild
and yet i have heard your worship sai observ panza that it is
veri meet for knightserr to sleep in wast and desert and that
thei esteem it veri good fortun
that is said don quixot when thei cannot help it or when thei
ar in love and so true is thi that there have been knight who have
remain two year on rock in sunshin and shade and all the
inclem of heaven without their ladi know anyth of it
and on of these wa amadi when under the name of beltenebro he
took up hi abod on the pea pobr fori know not if it wa eight
year or eight month for i am not veri sure of the reckon at ani
rate he stai there do penanc for i know not what piqu the
princess oriana had against him but no more of thi now sancho and
make hast befor a mishap like rocinant befal the ass
the veri devil would be in it in that case said sancho and let
off thirti oh and sixti sigh and a hundr and twenti
maledict and execr on whomsoev it wa that had brought him
there he rais himself stop halfwai bent like a turkish bow
without power to bring himself upright but with all hi pain he
saddl hi ass who too had gone astrai somewhat yield to the
excess licenc of the dai he next rais up rocinant and as for
him had he possess a tongu to complain with most assuredli neither
sancho nor hi master would have been behind him

to be brief sancho fix don quixot on the ass and secur rocinant
with a lead rein and take the ass by the halter he proceed
more or less in the direct in which it seem to him the high road
might be and as chanc wa conduct their affair for them from
good to better he had not gone a short leagu when the road came in
sight and on it he perceiv an inn which to hi annoy and to the
delight of don quixot must need be a castl sancho insist that it

the carrier had made an arrang with her for recreat that night
and she had given him her word that when the guest were quiet and the
famili asleep she would come in search of him and meet hi wish
unreservedli and it is said of thi good lass that she never made

the inn wa all in silenc and in the whole of it there wa no light
except that given by a lantern that hung burn in the middl of the
gatewai thi strang still and the thought alwai present to
our knight mind of the incid describ at everi turn in the
book that were the caus of hi misfortun conjur up to hi
imagin as extraordinari a delus as can well be conceiv which
wa that he fanci himself to have reach a famou castl for as
ha been said all the inn he lodg in were castl to hi ey and
that the daughter of the innkeep wa daughter of the lord of the
castl and that she won by hi highbr bear had fallen in love
with him and had promis to come to hi bed for a while that night
without the knowledg of her parent and hold all thi fantasi that
he had construct as solid fact he began to feel uneasi and to
consid the peril risk which hi virtu wa about to encount and
he resolv in hi heart to commit no treason to hi ladi dulcinea del
toboso even though the queen guinever herself and the dame quintaona
should present themselv befor him
while he wa taken up with these vagari then the time and the
houran unlucki on for himarriv for the asturian to come who in
her smock with bare feet and her hair gather into a fustian coif
with noiseless and cautiou step enter the chamber where the three
were quarter in quest of the carrier but scarc had she gain
the door when don quixot perceiv her and sit up in hi bed in
spite of hi plaster and the pain of hi rib he stretch out hi
arm to receiv hi beauteou damsel the asturian who went all
doubl up and in silenc with her hand befor her feel for her
lover encount the arm of don quixot who grasp her tightli by
the wrist and draw her toward him while she dare not utter a
word made her sit down on the bed he then felt her smock and
although it wa of sackcloth it appear to him to be of the finest and
softest silk on her wrist she wore some glass bead but to him thei
had the sheen of preciou orient pearl her hair which in some
measur resembl a hors mane he rate as thread of the brightest
gold of arabi whose refulg dim the sun himself her breath
which no doubt smelt of yesterdai stale salad seem to him to
diffus a sweet aromat fragranc from her mouth and in short he
drew her portrait in hi imagin with the same featur and in the
same style as that which he had seen in hi book of the other
princess who smitten by love came with all the adorn that ar
here set down to see the sore wound knight and so great wa the
poor gentleman blind that neither touch nor smell nor anyth
els about the good lass that would have made ani but a carrier vomit
were enough to undec him on the contrari he wa persuad he had
the goddess of beauti in hi arm and hold her firmli in hi grasp
he went on to sai in low tender voic
would that i found myself love and exalt ladi in a posit to
repai such a favour as that which you by the sight of your great
beauti have grant me but fortun which is never weari of
persecut the good ha chosen to place me upon thi bed where i lie
so bruis and broken that though my inclin would gladli compli
with your it is imposs besid to thi imposs anoth yet
greater is to be ad which is the faith that i have pledg to the
peerless dulcinea del toboso sole ladi of my most secret thought and
were it not that thi stood in the wai i should not be so insens a
knight as to miss the happi opportun which your great good ha
offer me
maritorn wa fret and sweat at find herself held so fast by
don quixot and not understand or heed the word he address to
her she strove without speak to free herself the worthi carrier
whose unholi thought kept him awak wa awar of hi doxi the moment
she enter the door and wa listen attent to all don quixot
said and jealou that the asturian should have broken her word with
him for anoth drew nearer to don quixot bed and stood still to
see what would come of thi talk which he could not understand but
when he perceiv the wench struggl to get free and don quixot
strive to hold her not relish the joke he rais hi arm and
deliv such a terribl cuff on the lank jaw of the amor knight
that he bath all hi mouth in blood and not content with thi he
mount on hi rib and with hi feet tramp all over them at a pace
rather smarter than a trot the bed which wa somewhat crazi and not
veri firm on it feet unabl to support the addit weight of the
carrier came to the ground and at the mighti crash of thi the
innkeep awok and at onc conclud that it must be some brawl of
maritorn becaus after call loudli to her he got no answer with
thi suspicion he got up and light a lamp hasten to the quarter
where he had heard the disturb the wench see that her master
wa come and know that hi temper wa terribl frighten and
panicstricken made for the bed of sancho panza who still slept and
crouch upon it made a ball of herself
the innkeep came in exclaim where art thou strumpet of cours
thi is some of thy work at thi sancho awok and feel thi mass
almost on top of him fanci he had the nightmar and began to
distribut fisticuff all round of which a certain share fell upon
maritorn who irrit by the pain and fling modesti asid paid
back so mani in return to sancho that she woke him up in spite of
himself he then find himself so handl by whom he knew not
rais himself up as well as he could grappl with maritorn and
he and she between them began the bitterest and drollest scrimmag in
the world the carrier howev perceiv by the light of the
innkeep candl how it fare with hi ladylov quit don quixot
ran to bring her the help she need and the innkeep did the same
but with a differ intent for hi wa to chastis the lass as he
believ that beyond a doubt she alon wa the caus of all the
harmoni and so as the sai is cat to rat rat to rope rope to
stick the carrier pound sancho sancho the lass she him and the
innkeep her and all work awai so briskli that thei did not give
themselv a moment rest and the best of it wa that the innkeep
lamp went out and as thei were left in the dark thei all laid on on
upon the other in a mass so unmercifulli that there wa not a sound
spot left where a hand could light
it so happen that there wa lodg that night in the inn a
caudrillero of what thei call the old holi brotherhood of toledo who
also hear the extraordinari nois of the conflict seiz hi staff
and the tin case with hi warrant and made hi wai in the dark into
the room cry hold in the name of the jurisdict hold in the

by thi time don quixot had recov from hi swoon and in the same

now sancho my friend art thou asleep sleepest thou friend
sancho
how can i sleep curs on it return sancho discontentedli and
bitterli when it is plain that all the devil have been at me thi

i know littl or thi castl is enchant for thou must knowbut thi
that i am now about to tell thee thou must swear to keep secret until
after my death
i swear it answer sancho
i sai so continu don quixot becaus i hate take awai anyon
good name
i sai repli sancho that i swear to hold my tongu about it till
the end of your worship dai and god grant i mai be abl to let it
out tomorrow
do i do thee such injuri sancho said don quixot that thou
wouldst see me dead so soon
it is not for that repli sancho but becaus i hate keep
thing long and i dont want them to grow rotten with me from
overkeep
at ani rate said don quixot i have more confid in thy
affect and good natur and so i would have thee know that thi
night there befel me on of the strangest adventur that i could
describ and to relat it to thee briefli thou must know that a littl
while ago the daughter of the lord of thi castl came to me and that
she is the most eleg and beauti damsel that could be found in the
wide world what i could tell thee of the charm of her person of her
live wit of other secret matter which to preserv the fealti i ow
to my ladi dulcinea del toboso i shall pass over unnot and in
silenc i will onli tell thee that either fate be enviou of so
great a boon place in my hand by good fortun or perhap and thi
is more probabl thi castl be as i have alreadi said enchant
at the time when i wa engag in the sweetest and most amor
discours with her there came without my see or know whenc it
came a hand attach to some arm of some huge giant that plant such
a cuff on my jaw that i have them all bath in blood and then
pummel me in such a wai that i am in a wors plight than yesterdai
when the carrier on account of rocinant misbehaviour inflict on
us the injuri thou knowest of whenc conjectur that there must be
some enchant moor guard the treasur of thi damsel beauti and
that it is not for me
not for me either said sancho for more than four hundr moor
have so thrash me that the drub of the stake wa cake and
fancybread to it but tell me seor what do you call thi excel
and rare adventur that ha left us as we ar left now though your
worship wa not so badli off have in your arm that incompar
beauti you spoke of but i what did i have except the heaviest whack
i think i had in all my life unlucki me and the mother that bore me
for i am not a knighterr and never expect to be on and of all the
mishap the greater part fall to my share
then thou hast been thrash too said don quixot
didnt i sai so wors luck to my line said sancho
be not distress friend said don quixot for i will now make the
preciou balsam with which we shall cure ourselv in the twinkl of
an ey
by thi time the cuadrillero had succeed in light the lamp and
came in to see the man that he thought had been kill and as sancho
caught sight of him at the door see him come in hi shirt with a
cloth on hi head and a lamp in hi hand and a veri forbid
counten he said to hi master seor can it be that thi is the
enchant moor come back to give us more castig if there be
anyth still left in the inkbottl
it cannot be the moor answer don quixot for those under
enchant do not let themselv be seen by anyon
if thei dont let themselv be seen thei let themselv be felt
said sancho if not let my shoulder speak to the point
mine could speak too said don quixot but that is not a suffici
reason for believ that what we see is the enchant moor
the offic came up and find them engag in such a peac
convers stood amaz though don quixot to be sure still lai
on hi back unabl to move from pure pummel and plaster the
offic turn to him and said well how goe it good man
i would speak more polit if i were you repli don quixot is
it the wai of thi countri to address knightserr in that style you
boobi
the cuadrillero find himself so disrespectfulli treat by such a
sorrylook individu lost hi temper and rais the lamp full of
oil smote don quixot such a blow with it on the head that he gave him
a badli broken pate then all be in dark he went out and
sancho panza said that is certainli the enchant moor seor and he
keep the treasur for other and for us onli the cuff and
lampwhack
that is the truth answer don quixot and there is no us in
troubl oneself about these matter of enchant or be angri or
vex at them for as thei ar invis and visionari we shall find no
on on whom to aveng ourselv do what we mai rise sancho if thou
canst and call the alcaid of thi fortress and get him to give me a
littl oil wine salt and rosemari to make the salutifer balsam
for inde i believ i have great need of it now becaus i am lose
much blood from the wound that phantom gave me
sancho got up with pain enough in hi bone and went after the
innkeep in the dark and meet the offic who wa look to see
what had becom of hi enemi he said to him seor whoever you ar
do us the favour and kind to give us a littl rosemari oil salt
and wine for it is want to cure on of the best knightserr on
earth who li on yonder bed wound by the hand of the enchant
moor that is in thi inn
when the offic heard him talk in thi wai he took him for a man out
of hi sens and as dai wa now begin to break he open the inn
gate and call the host he told him what thi good man want the
host furnish him with what he requir and sancho brought it to don
quixot who with hi hand to hi head wa bewail the pain of the
blow of the lamp which had done him no more harm than rais a coupl
of rather larg lump and what he fanci blood wa onli the sweat
that flow from him in hi suffer dure the late storm to be
brief he took the materi of which he made a compound mix them
all and boil them a good while until it seem to him thei had come
to perfect he then ask for some vial to pour it into and as
there wa not on in the inn he decid on put it into a tin
oilbottl or flask of which the host made him a free gift and over
the flask he repeat more than eighti paternost and as mani more
avemaria salv and credo accompani each word with a cross by
wai of benedict at all which there were present sancho the
innkeep and the cuadrillero for the carrier wa now peacefulli
engag in attend to the comfort of hi mule
thi be accomplish he felt anxiou to make trial himself on the
spot of the virtu of thi preciou balsam as he consid it and
so he drank near a quart of what could not be put into the flask and
remain in the pigskin in which it had been boil but scarc had
he done drink when he began to vomit in such a wai that noth wa
left in hi stomach and with the pang and spasm of vomit he broke
into a profus sweat on account of which he bade them cover him up and
leav him alon thei did so and he lai sleep more than three
hour at the end of which he awok and felt veri great bodili relief
and so much eas from hi bruis that he thought himself quit cure
and verili believ he had hit upon the balsam of fierabra and that
with thi remedi he might thenceforward without ani fear face ani
kind of destruct battl or combat howev peril it might be
sancho panza who also regard the amend of hi master as
miracul beg him to give him what wa left in the pigskin which
wa no small quantiti don quixot consent and he take it with
both hand in good faith and with a better will gulp down and
drain off veri littl less than hi master but the fact is that the
stomach of poor sancho wa of necess not so delic as that of hi
master and so befor vomit he wa seiz with such gripe and
retch and such sweat and faint that verili and truli he
believ hi last hour had come and find himself so rack and
torment he curs the balsam and the thief that had given it to him
don quixot see him in thi state said it is my belief sancho
that thi mischief come of thy not be dub a knight for i am
persuad thi liquor cannot be good for those who ar not so
if your worship knew that return sanchowo betid me and all my
kindredwhi did you let me tast it
at thi moment the draught took effect and the poor squir began to
discharg both wai at such a rate that the rush mat on which he had
thrown himself and the canva blanket he had cover him were fit for
noth afterward he sweat and perspir with such paroxysm and
convuls that not onli he himself but all present thought hi end
had come thi tempest and tribul last about two hour at the
end of which he wa left not like hi master but so weak and
exhaust that he could not stand don quixot howev who as ha
been said felt himself reliev and well wa eager to take hi
departur at onc in quest of adventur as it seem to him that all
the time he loiter there wa a fraud upon the world and those in it
who stood in need of hi help and protect all the more when he had
the secur and confid hi balsam afford him and so urg by
thi impuls he saddl rocinant himself and put the packsaddl on
hi squir beast whom likewis he help to dress and mount the ass
after which he mount hi hors and turn to a corner of the inn he
laid hold of a pike that stood there to serv him by wai of a lanc
all that were in the inn who were more than twenti person stood
watch him the innkeep daughter wa likewis observ him and
he too never took hi ey off her and from time to time fetch a
sigh that he seem to pluck up from the depth of hi bowel but thei
all thought it must be from the pain he felt in hi rib at ani rate
thei who had seen him plaster the night befor thought so
as soon as thei were both mount at the gate of the inn he call to
the host and said in a veri grave and measur voic mani and great
ar the favour seor alcaid that i have receiv in thi castl of
your and i remain under the deepest oblig to be grate to you
for them all the dai of my life if i can repai them in aveng you
of ani arrog foe who mai have wrong you know that my call is
no other than to aid the weak to aveng those who suffer wrong and to
chastis perfidi search your memori and if you find anyth of thi
kind you need onli tell me of it and i promis you by the order of
knighthood which i have receiv to procur you satisfact and
repar to the utmost of your desir
the innkeep repli to him with equal calm sir knight i do not
want your worship to aveng me of ani wrong becaus when ani is done
me i can take what vengeanc seem good to me the onli thing i want is
that you pai me the score that you have run up in the inn last night

then thi is an inn said don quixot
and a veri respect on said the innkeep
i have been under a mistak all thi time answer don quixot for
in truth i thought it wa a castl and not a bad on but sinc it
appear that it is not a castl but an inn all that can be done now is
that you should excus the payment for i cannot contraven the rule of
knightserr of whom i know as a fact and up to the present i have
read noth to the contrari that thei never paid for lodg or
anyth els in the inn where thei might be for ani hospit that
might be offer them is their due by law and right in return for the
insuffer toil thei endur in seek adventur by night and by
dai in summer and in winter on foot and on horseback in hunger and
thirst cold and heat expos to all the inclem of heaven and
all the hardship of earth
i have littl to do with that repli the innkeep pai me what
you ow me and let us have no more talk of chivalri for all i care
about is to get my monei
you ar a stupid scurvi innkeep said don quixot and put
spur to rocinant and bring hi pike to the slope he rode out of
the inn befor anyon could stop him and push on some distanc
without look to see if hi squir wa follow him
the innkeep when he saw him go without pai him ran to get payment
of sancho who said that as hi master would not pai neither would he
becaus be as he wa squir to a knighterr the same rule and
reason held good for him as for hi master with regard to not pai
anyth in inn and hostelri at thi the innkeep wax veri
wroth and threaten if he did not pai to compel him in a wai that he
would not like to which sancho made answer that by the law of chivalri
hi master had receiv he would not pai a rap though it cost him hi
life for the excel and ancient usag of knightserr wa not
go to be violat by him nor should the squir of such as were yet
to come into the world ever complain of him or reproach him with
break so just a privileg
the illluck of the unfortun sancho so order it that among the
compani in the inn there were four woolcard from segovia three
needlemak from the colt of cordova and two lodger from the fair
of sevil live fellow tenderheart fond of a joke and
play who almost as if instig and move by a common impuls
made up to sancho and dismount him from hi ass while on of them
went in for the blanket of the host bed but on fling him into it
thei look up and see that the ceil wa somewhat lower than
what thei requir for their work thei decid upon go out into the
yard which wa bound by the sky and there put sancho in the
middl of the blanket thei began to rais him high make sport with
him as thei would with a dog at shrovetid

the cri of the poor blanket wretch were so loud that thei reach
the ear of hi master who halt to listen attent wa
persuad that some new adventur wa come until he clearli
perceiv that it wa hi squir who utter them wheel about he
came up to the inn with a labori gallop and find it shut went
round it to see if he could find some wai of get in but as soon as
he came to the wall of the yard which wa not veri high he discov
the game that wa be plai with hi squir he saw him rise and
fall in the air with such grace and nimbl that had hi rage
allow him it is my belief he would have laugh he tri to climb
from hi hors on to the top of the wall but he wa so bruis and
batter that he could not even dismount and so from the back of hi
hors he began to utter such maledict and objurg against
those who were blanket sancho as it would be imposs to write
down accur thei howev did not stai their laughter or their
work for thi nor did the fly sancho ceas hi lament
mingl now with threat now with entreati but all to littl
purpos or none at all until from pure weari thei left off thei
then brought him hi ass and mount him on top of it thei put hi
jacket round him and the compassion maritorn see him so
exhaust thought fit to refresh him with a jug of water and that it
might be all the cooler she fetch it from the well sancho took it
and as he wa rais it to hi mouth he wa stop by the cri of
hi master exclaim sancho my son drink not water drink it not
my son for it will kill thee see here i have the bless balsam and
he held up the flask of liquor and with drink two drop of it thou
wilt certainli be restor
at these word sancho turn hi ey asquint and in a still louder
voic said can it be your worship ha forgotten that i am not a
knight or do you want me to end by vomit up what bowel i have left
after last night keep your liquor in the name of all the devil and
leav me to myself and at on and the same instant he left off
talk and began drink but as at the first sup he perceiv it wa
water he did not care to go on with it and beg maritorn to fetch
him some wine which she did with right good will and paid for it with
her own monei for inde thei sai of her that though she wa in that
line of life there wa some faint and distant resembl to a
christian about her when sancho had done drink he dug hi heel
into hi ass and the gate of the inn be thrown open he pass out
veri well pleas at have paid noth and carri hi point though
it had been at the expens of hi usual sureti hi shoulder it is
true that the innkeep detain hi alforja in payment of what wa

never miss them the innkeep as soon as he saw him off want to
bar the gate close but the blanket would not agre to it for thei

sancho reach hi master so limp and faint that he could not urg on
hi beast when don quixot saw the state he wa in he said i have
now come to the conclus good sancho that thi castl or inn is
beyond a doubt enchant becaus those who have so atroci
divert themselv with thee what can thei be but phantom or be
of anoth world and i hold thi confirm by have notic that when
i wa by the wall of the yard wit the act of thy sad tragedi
it wa out of my power to mount upon it nor could i even dismount from
rocinant becaus thei no doubt had me enchant for i swear to thee
by the faith of what i am that if i had been abl to climb up or
dismount i would have aveng thee in such a wai that those braggart
thiev would have rememb their freak for ever even though in so
do i knew that i contraven the law of chivalri which as i have
often told thee do not permit a knight to lai hand on him who is not
on save in case of urgent and great necess in defenc of hi own
life and person
i would have aveng myself too if i could said sancho whether i
had been dub knight or not but i could not though for my part i am
persuad those who amus themselv with me were not phantom or
enchant men as your worship sai but men of flesh and bone like
ourselv and thei all had their name for i heard them name them
when thei were toss me and on wa call pedro martinez and
anoth tenorio hernandez and the innkeep i heard wa call juan
palomequ the lefthand so that seor your not be abl to leap
over the wall of the yard or dismount from your hors came of someth
els besid enchant and what i make out clearli from all thi
is that these adventur we go seek will in the end lead us into
such misadventur that we shall not know which is our right foot and
that the best and wisest thing accord to my small wit would be
for us to return home now that it is harvesttim and attend to our
busi and give over wander from zeca to mecca and from pail to
bucket as the sai is
how littl thou knowest about chivalri sancho repli don quixot
hold thy peac and have patienc the dai will come when thou shalt
see with thine own ey what an honour thing it is to wander in the
pursuit of thi call nai tell me what greater pleasur can there
be in the world or what delight can equal that of win a battl
and triumph over on enemi none beyond all doubt
veri like answer sancho though i do not know it all i know is
that sinc we have been knightserr or sinc your worship ha been
on for i have no right to reckon myself on of so honour a
number we have never won ani battl except the on with the biscayan
and even out of that your worship came with half an ear and half a
helmet the less and from that till now it ha been all cudgel and
more cudgel cuff and more cuff i get the blanket over
and abov and fall in with enchant person on whom i cannot
aveng myself so as to know what the delight as your worship call it
of conquer an enemi is like
that is what vex me and what ought to vex thee sancho repli
don quixot but henceforward i will endeavour to have at hand some
sword made by such craft that no kind of enchant can take effect
upon him who carri it and it is even possibl that fortun mai
procur for me that which belong to amadi when he wa call the
knight of the burn sword which wa on of the best sword that
ever knight in the world possess for besid have the said
virtu it cut like a razor and there wa no armour howev strong
and enchant it might be that could resist it
such is my luck said sancho that even if that happen and your
worship found some such sword it would like the balsam turn out
servic and good for dub knight onli and as for the squir
thei might sup sorrow
fear not that sancho said don quixot heaven will deal better by
thee
thu talk don quixot and hi squir were go along when on the
road thei were follow don quixot perceiv approach them a
larg and thick cloud of dust on see which he turn to sancho and
said
thi is the dai sancho on which will be seen the boon my fortun is
reserv for me thi i sai is the dai on which as much as on ani
other shall be displai the might of my arm and on which i shall do
deed that shall remain written in the book of fame for all ag to
come seest thou that cloud of dust which rise yonder well then all
that is churn up by a vast armi compos of variou and countless
nation that come march there
accord to that there must be two said sancho for on thi
opposit side also there rise just such anoth cloud of dust
don quixot turn to look and found that it wa true and rejoic
exceedingli he conclud that thei were two armi about to engag and
encount in the midst of that broad plain for at all time and
season hi fanci wa full of the battl enchant adventur
crazi feat love and defianc that ar record in the book of
chivalri and everyth he said thought or did had refer to such
thing now the cloud of dust he had seen wa rais by two great
drove of sheep come along the same road in opposit direct
which becaus of the dust did not becom visibl until thei drew
near but don quixot assert so posit that thei were armi that
sancho wa led to believ it and sai well and what ar we to do
seor

what said don quixot give aid and assist to the weak and
those who need it and thou must know sancho that thi which come
opposit to us is conduct and led by the mighti emperor alifanfaron
lord of the great isl of trapobana thi other that march behind me
is that of hi enemi the king of the garamanta pentapolin of the bare
arm for he alwai goe into battl with hi right arm bare
but why ar these two lord such enemi
thei ar at enmiti repli don quixot becaus thi alifanfaron is
a furiou pagan and is in love with the daughter of pentapolin who is
a veri beauti and moreov graciou ladi and a christian and her
father is unwil to bestow her upon the pagan king unless he first
abandon the religion of hi fals prophet mahomet and adopt hi
own
by my beard said sancho but pentapolin doe quit right and i
will help him as much as i can
in that thou wilt do what is thy duti sancho said don quixot for
to engag in battl of thi sort it is not requisit to be a dub
knight
that i can well understand answer sancho but where shall we put
thi ass where we mai be sure to find him after the frai is over for i
believ it ha not been the custom so far to go into battl on a beast
of thi kind
that is true said don quixot and what you had best do with him is
to leav him to take hi chanc whether he be lost or not for the
hors we shall have when we come out victor will be so mani that even
rocinant will run a risk of be chang for anoth but attend to
me and observ for i wish to give thee some account of the chief
knight who accompani these two armi and that thou mayest the better
see and mark let us withdraw to that hillock which rise yonder
whenc both armi mai be seen
thei did so and place themselv on a rise ground from which the
two drove that don quixot made armi of might have been plainli seen
if the cloud of dust thei rais had not obscur them and blind the
sight nevertheless see in hi imagin what he did not see and
what did not exist he began thu in a loud voic
that knight whom thou seest yonder in yellow armour who bear upon
hi shield a lion crown crouch at the feet of a damsel is the
valiant laurcalco lord of the silver bridg that on in armour with
flower of gold who bear on hi shield three crown argent on an
azur field is the dread micocolembo grand duke of quirocia that
other of gigant frame on hi right hand is the ever dauntless
brandabarbaran de bolich lord of the three arabia who for armour
wear that serpent skin and ha for shield a gate which accord to
tradit is on of those of the templ that samson brought to the
ground when by hi death he reveng himself upon hi enemi but turn
thine ey to the other side and thou shalt see in front and in the
van of thi other armi the ever victori and never vanquish timonel
of carcajona princ of new biscai who come in armour with arm
quarter azur vert white and yellow and bear on hi shield a cat
or on a field tawni with a motto which sai miau which is the
begin of the name of hi ladi who accord to report is the
peerless miaulina daughter of the duke alfeniquen of the algarv the
other who burden and press the loin of that power charger and
bear arm white as snow and a shield blank and without ani devic is
a novic knight a frenchman by birth pierr papin by name lord of
the baroni of utriqu that other who with ironshod heel strike
the flank of that nimbl particolour zebra and for arm bear
azur vair is the mighti duke of nerbia espartafilardo del bosqu
who bear for devic on hi shield an asparagu plant with a motto in
castilian that sai rastrea mi suert and so he went on name a

without a paus he continu peopl of diver nation compos thi

their herd along the spread pastur of the wind guadiana fame
for it hidden cours those that trembl with the cold of the pineclad

mani as all europ includ and contain
good god what a number of countri and nation he name give to
each it proper attribut with marvel readi brim and
satur with what he had read in hi ly book sancho panza hung
upon hi word without speak and from time to time turn to try if
he could see the knight and giant hi master wa describ and as
he could not make out on of them he said to him
seor devil take it if there a sign of ani man you talk of knight
or giant in the whole thing mayb it all enchant like the
phantom last night
how canst thou sai that answer don quixot dost thou not hear
the neigh of the steed the brai of the trumpet the roll of
the drum
i hear noth but a great bleat of ew and sheep said sancho
which wa true for by thi time the two flock had come close
the fear thou art in sancho said don quixot prevent thee from
see or hear correctli for on of the effect of fear is to
derang the sens and make thing appear differ from what thei ar
if thou art in such fear withdraw to on side and leav me to myself
for alon i suffic to bring victori to that side to which i shall give
my aid and so sai he gave rocinant the spur and put the
lanc in rest shot down the slope like a thunderbolt sancho shout
after him cry come back seor don quixot i vow to god thei ar
sheep and ew you ar charg come back unlucki the father that
begot me what mad is thi look there is no giant nor knight
nor cat nor arm nor shield quarter or whole nor vair azur or
bedevil what ar you about sinner that i am befor god but not
for all these entreati did don quixot turn back on the contrari he
went on shout out ho knight ye who follow and fight under the
banner of the valiant emperor pentapolin of the bare arm follow me
all ye shall see how easili i shall give him hi reveng over hi
enemi alifanfaron of the trapobana
so sai he dash into the midst of the squadron of ew and began
spear them with as much spirit and intrepid as if he were
transfix mortal enemi in earnest the shepherd and drover
accompani the flock shout to him to desist see it wa no us
thei ungirt their sling and began to salut hi ear with stone as
big as on fist don quixot gave no heed to the stone but let
drive right and left kept sai
where art thou proud alifanfaron come befor me i am a singl
knight who would fain prove thy prowess hand to hand and make thee
yield thy life a penalti for the wrong thou dost to the valiant
pentapolin garamanta here came a sugarplum from the brook that
struck him on the side and buri a coupl of rib in hi bodi feel
himself so smitten he imagin himself slain or badli wound for
certain and recollect hi liquor he drew out hi flask and put
it to hi mouth began to pour the content into hi stomach but er he
had succeed in swallow what seem to him enough there came
anoth almond which struck him on the hand and on the flask so fairli
that it smash it to piec knock three or four teeth and grinder
out of hi mouth in it cours and sore crush two finger of hi
hand such wa the forc of the first blow and of the second that the
poor knight in spite of himself came down backward off hi hors the
shepherd came up and felt sure thei had kill him so in all hast
thei collect their flock togeth took up the dead beast of which
there were more than seven and made off without wait to ascertain
anyth further
all thi time sancho stood on the hill watch the crazi feat hi
master wa perform and tear hi beard and curs the hour and
the occas when fortun had made him acquaint with him see him
then brought to the ground and that the shepherd had taken
themselv off he ran to him and found him in veri bad case though
not unconsci and said he
did i not tell you to come back seor don quixot and that what you
were go to attack were not armi but drove of sheep
that how that thief of a sage my enemi can alter and falsifi
thing answer don quixot thou must know sancho that it is a
veri easi matter for those of hi sort to make us believ what thei
choos and thi malign be who persecut me enviou of the
glori he knew i wa to win in thi battl ha turn the squadron of
the enemi into drove of sheep at ani rate do thi much i beg of
thee sancho to undec thyself and see that what i sai is true
mount thy ass and follow them quietli and thou shalt see that when
thei have gone some littl distanc from thi thei will return to their
origin shape and ceas to be sheep becom men in all respect as
i describ them to thee at first but go not just yet for i want thy
help and assist come hither and see how mani of my teeth and
grinder ar miss for i feel as if there wa not on left in my
mouth
sancho came so close that he almost put hi ey into hi mouth now
just at that moment the balsam had act on the stomach of don quixot
so at the veri instant when sancho came to examin hi mouth he
discharg all it content with more forc than a musket and full
into the beard of the compassion squir
holi mari cri sancho what is thi that ha happen me clearli
thi sinner is mortal wound as he vomit blood from the mouth
but consid the matter a littl more close he perceiv by the
colour tast and smell that it wa not blood but the balsam from the
flask which he had seen him drink and he wa taken with such a
loath that hi stomach turn and he vomit up hi insid over hi
veri master and both were left in a preciou state sancho ran to hi
ass to get someth wherewith to clean himself and reliev hi
master out of hi alforja but not find them he wellnigh took
leav of hi sens and curs himself anew and in hi heart resolv
to quit hi master and return home even though he forfeit the wage
of hi servic and all hope of the promis island
don quixot now rose and put hi left hand to hi mouth to keep
hi teeth from fall out altogeth with the other he laid hold of
the bridl of rocinant who had never stir from hi master
sideso loyal and wellbehav wa heand betook himself to where the
squir stood lean over hi ass with hi hand to hi cheek like on
in deep deject see him in thi mood look so sad don quixot
said to him
bear in mind sancho that on man is no more than anoth unless he
doe more than anoth all these tempest that fall upon us ar sign
that fair weather is come shortli and that thing will go well with
us for it is imposs for good or evil to last for ever and henc
it follow that the evil have last long the good must be now nigh
at hand so thou must not distress thyself at the misfortun which
happen to me sinc thou hast no share in them
how have i not repli sancho wa he whom thei blanket yesterdai
perchanc ani other than my father son and the alforja that ar
miss todai with all my treasur did thei belong to ani other but
myself
what ar the alforja miss sancho said don quixot
ye thei ar miss answer sancho
in that case we have noth to eat todai repli don quixot
it would be so answer sancho if there were none of the herb
your worship sai you know in these meadow those with which
knightserr as unlucki as your worship ar wont to suppli suchlik
shortcom
for all that answer don quixot i would rather have just now a
quarter of bread or a loaf and a coupl of pilchard head than all
the herb describ by dioscorid even with doctor laguna note
nevertheless sancho the good mount thy beast and come along with me
for god who provid for all thing will not fail us more especi
when we ar so activ in hi servic as we ar sinc he fail not the
midg of the air nor the grub of the earth nor the tadpol of the
water and is so merci that he maketh hi sun to rise on the good
and on the evil and sendeth rain on the unjust and on the just
your worship would make a better preacher than knighterr said
sancho
knightserr knew and ought to know everyth sancho said don
quixot for there were knightserr in former time as well
qualifi to deliv a sermon or discours in the middl of an
encamp as if thei had graduat in the univers of pari
wherebi we mai see that the lanc ha never blunt the pen nor the
pen the lanc
well be it as your worship sai repli sancho let us be off now
and find some place of shelter for the night and god grant it mai be
somewher where there ar no blanket nor blanket nor phantom
nor enchant moor for if there ar mai the devil take the whole
concern
ask that of god my son said don quixot and do thou lead on where
thou wilt for thi time i leav our lodg to thy choic but reach
me here thy hand and feel with thy finger and find out how mani of my
teeth and grinder ar miss from thi right side of the upper jaw
for it is there i feel the pain
sancho put in hi finger and feel about ask him how mani
grinder us your worship have on thi side
four repli don quixot besid the backtooth all whole and
quit sound
mind what you ar sai seor
i sai four if not five answer don quixot for never in my life
have i had tooth or grinder drawn nor ha ani fallen out or been
destroi by ani decai or rheum
well then said sancho in thi lower side your worship ha no more
than two grinder and a half and in the upper neither a half nor ani
at all for it is all as smooth as the palm of my hand
luckless that i am said don quixot hear the sad new hi squir
gave him i had rather thei despoil me of an arm so it were not the
swordarm for i tell thee sancho a mouth without teeth is like a
mill without a millston and a tooth is much more to be prize than a
diamond but we who profess the auster order of chivalri ar liabl to
all thi mount friend and lead the wai and i will follow thee at
whatev pace thou wilt
sancho did as he bade him and proceed in the direct in which he
thought he might find refug without quit the high road which wa
there veri much frequent as thei went along then at a slow
pacefor the pain in don quixot jaw kept him uneasi and
illdispos for speedsancho thought it well to amus and divert him
by talk of some kind and among the thing he said to him wa that
which will be told in the follow chapter
c18ejpg 44k
chapter xix
of the shrewd discours which sancho held with hi master and of the
adventur that befel him with a dead bodi togeth with other notabl
occurr
it seem to me seor that all these mishap that have befallen us of
late have been without ani doubt a punish for the offenc commit
by your worship against the order of chivalri in not keep the oath
you made not to eat bread off a tablecloth or embrac the queen and
all the rest of it that your worship swore to observ until you had
taken that helmet of malandrino or whatev the moor is call for
i do not veri well rememb
thou art veri right sancho said don quixot but to tell the
truth it had escap my memori and likewis thou mayest reli upon it
that the affair of the blanket happen to thee becaus of thy fault in
not remind me of it in time but i will make amend for there ar
wai of compound for everyth in the order of chivalri
why have i taken an oath of some sort then said sancho
it make no matter that thou hast not taken an oath said don
quixot suffic it that i see thou art not quit clear of complic
and whether or no it will not be ill done to provid ourselv with a
remedi
in that case said sancho mind that your worship doe not forget
thi as you did the oath perhap the phantom mai take it into their
head to amus themselv onc more with me or even with your worship
if thei see you so obstin
while engag in thi and other talk night overtook them on the road
befor thei had reach or discov ani place of shelter and what
made it still wors wa that thei were dy of hunger for with the
loss of the alforja thei had lost their entir larder and
commissariat and to complet the misfortun thei met with an adventur
which without ani invent had realli the appear of on it so
happen that the night close in somewhat darkli but for all that
thei push on sancho feel sure that as the road wa the king
highwai thei might reason expect to find some inn within a leagu
or two go along then in thi wai the night dark the squir
hungri the master sharpset thei saw come toward them on the road
thei were travel a great number of light which look exactli like
star in motion sancho wa taken aback at the sight of them nor did
don quixot altogeth relish them the on pull up hi ass by the
halter the other hi hack by the bridl and thei stood still
watch anxious to see what all thi would turn out to be and found
that the light were approach them and the nearer thei came the
greater thei seem at which spectacl sancho began to shake like a
man dose with mercuri and don quixot hair stood on end he
howev pluck up spirit a littl said
thi no doubt sancho will be a most mighti and peril adventur
in which it will be need for me to put forth all my valour and
resolut
unlucki me answer sancho if thi adventur happen to be on of
phantom as i am begin to think it is where shall i find the rib
to bear it
be thei phantom ever so much said don quixot i will not permit
them to touch a thread of thy garment for if thei plai trick with
thee the time befor it wa becaus i wa unabl to leap the wall of
the yard but now we ar on a wide plain where i shall be abl to
wield my sword as i pleas
and if thei enchant and crippl you as thei did the last time said
sancho what differ will it make be on the open plain or not
for all that repli don quixot i entreat thee sancho to keep a
good heart for experi will tell thee what mine is
i will pleas god answer sancho and the two retir to on side
of the road set themselv to observ close what all these move
light might be and veri soon afterward thei made out some twenti
encamisado all on horseback with light torch in their hand the
aweinspir aspect of whom complet extinguish the courag of
sancho who began to chatter with hi teeth like on in the cold fit of
an agu and hi heart sank and hi teeth chatter still more when
thei perceiv distinctli that behind them there came a litter cover
over with black and follow by six more mount figur in mourn
down to the veri feet of their mulesfor thei could perceiv plainli
thei were not hors by the easi pace at which thei went and as the
encamisado came along thei mutter to themselv in a low plaintiv
tone thi strang spectacl at such an hour and in such a solitari
place wa quit enough to strike terror into sancho heart and even
into hi master and save in don quixot case did so for all
sancho resolut had now broken down it wa just the opposit with
hi master whose imagin immedi conjur up all thi to him
vividli as on of the adventur of hi book
he took it into hi head that the litter wa a bier on which wa born
some sore wound or slain knight to aveng whom wa a task reserv
for him alon and without ani further reason he laid hi lanc in
rest fix himself firmli in hi saddl and with gallant spirit and
bear took up hi posit in the middl of the road where the
encamisado must of necess pass and as soon as he saw them near at
hand he rais hi voic and said
halt knight or whosoev ye mai be and render me account of who ye
ar whenc ye come where ye go what it is ye carri upon that bier
for to judg by appear either ye have done some wrong or some
wrong ha been done to you and it is fit and necessari that i
should know either that i mai chastis you for the evil ye have done
or els that i mai aveng you for the injuri that ha been inflict
upon you
we ar in hast answer on of the encamisado and the inn is far
off and we cannot stop to render you such an account as you demand
and spur hi mule he move on
don quixot wa mightili provok by thi answer and seiz the mule
by the bridl he said halt and be more mannerli and render an
account of what i have ask of you els take my defianc to combat
all of you
the mule wa shy and wa so frighten at her bridl be seiz that
rear up she flung her rider to the ground over her haunch an
attend who wa on foot see the encamisado fall began to abus
don quixot who now move to anger without ani more ado lai hi
lanc in rest charg on of the men in mourn and brought him badli
wound to the ground and as he wheel round upon the other the
agil with which he attack and rout them wa a sight to see for
it seem just as if wing had that instant grown upon rocinant so
lightli and proudli did he bear himself the encamisado were all timid
folk and unarm so thei speedili made their escap from the frai and
set off at a run across the plain with their light torch look
exactli like masker run on some gala or festiv night the
mourner too envelop and swath in their skirt and gown were
unabl to bestir themselv and so with entir safeti to himself don
quixot belabour them all and drove them off against their will for
thei all thought it wa no man but a devil from hell come to carri awai
the dead bodi thei had in the litter
sancho beheld all thi in astonish at the intrepid of hi lord
and said to himself clearli thi master of mine is as bold and
valiant as he sai he is
a burn torch lai on the ground near the first man whom the mule had
thrown by the light of which don quixot perceiv him and come up
to him he present the point of the lanc to hi face call on him
to yield himself prison or els he would kill him to which the
prostrat man repli i am prison enough as it is i cannot stir
for on of my leg is broken i entreat you if you be a christian
gentleman not to kill me which will be commit grave sacrileg
for i am a licenti and i hold first order
then what the devil brought you here be a churchman said don
quixot
what seor said the other my bad luck
then still wors await you said don quixot if you do not satisfi
me as to all i ask you at first
you shall be soon satisfi said the licenti you must know
then that though just now i said i wa a licenti i am onli a
bachelor and my name is alonzo lopez i am a nativ of alcobenda i
come from the citi of baeza with eleven other priest the same who
fled with the torch and we ar go to the citi of segovia
accompani a dead bodi which is in that litter and is that of a
gentleman who di in baeza where he wa inter and now as i said
we ar take hi bone to their burialplac which is in segovia
where he wa born
and who kill him ask don quixot
god by mean of a malign fever that took him answer the
bachelor
in that case said don quixot the lord ha reliev me of the task
of aveng hi death had ani other slain him but he who slew him
have slain him there is noth for it but to be silent and shrug
on shoulder i should do the same were he to slai myself and i
would have your rever know that i am a knight of la mancha don
quixot by name and it is my busi and call to roam the world

i do not know how that about right wrong can be said the
bachelor for from straight you have made me crook leav me with
a broken leg that will never see itself straight again all the dai of
it life and the injuri you have redress in my case ha been to
leav me injur in such a wai that i shall remain injur for ever
and the height of misadventur it wa to fall in with you who go in
search of adventur
thing do not all happen in the same wai answer don quixot it
all came sir bachelor alonzo lopez of your go as you did by
night dress in those surplic with light torch prai
cover with mourn so that natur you look like someth evil
and of the other world and so i could not avoid do my duti in
attack you and i should have attack you even had i known
posit that you were the veri devil of hell for such i certainli
believ and took you to be
as my fate ha so will it said the bachelor i entreat you sir
knighterr whose errand ha been such an evil on for me to help
me to get from under thi mule that hold on of my leg caught between
the stirrup and the saddl
i would have talk on till tomorrow said don quixot how long
were you go to wait befor tell me of your distress
he at onc call to sancho who howev had no mind to come as he
wa just then engag in unload a sumpter mule well laden with
provend which these worthi gentlemen had brought with them sancho
made a bag of hi coat and get togeth as much as he could and
as the bag would hold he load hi beast and then hasten to obei
hi master call and help him to remov the bachelor from under the
mule then put him on her back he gave him the torch and don
quixot bade him follow the track of hi companion and beg pardon of
them on hi part for the wrong which he could not help do them
and said sancho if by chanc these gentlemen should want to know who
wa the hero that serv them so your worship mai tell them that he is
the famou don quixot of la mancha otherwis call the knight of the
rueful counten
the bachelor then took hi departur
i forgot to mention that befor he did so he said to don quixot
rememb that you stand excommun for have laid violent hand
on a holi thing juxta illud si qui suadent diabolo
i do not understand that latin answer don quixot but i know
well i did not lai hand onli thi pike besid i did not think i
wa commit an assault upon priest or thing of the church which
like a cathol and faith christian as i am i respect and rever
but upon phantom and spectr of the other world but even so i
rememb how it fare with cid rui diaz when he broke the chair of the
ambassador of that king befor hi holi the pope who
excommun him for the same and yet the good roderick of vivar
bore himself that dai like a veri nobl and valiant knight
on hear thi the bachelor took hi departur as ha been said
without make ani repli and don quixot ask sancho what had induc
him to call him the knight of the rueful counten more then than
at ani other time
i will tell you answer sancho it wa becaus i have been look
at you for some time by the light of the torch held by that
unfortun and verili your worship ha got of late the most
illfavour counten i ever saw it must be either ow to the
fatigu of thi combat or els to the want of teeth and grinder
it is not that repli don quixot but becaus the sage whose duti
it will be to write the histori of my achiev must have thought it
proper that i should take some distinct name as all knight of yore
did on be he of the burn sword anoth he of the unicorn
thi on he of the damsel that he of the phnix anoth the
knight of the griffin and anoth he of the death and by these
name and design thei were known all the world round and so i
sai that the sage aforesaid must have put it into your mouth and mind
just now to call me the knight of the rueful counten as i intend
to call myself from thi dai forward and that the said name mai fit me
better i mean when the opportun offer to have a veri rueful
counten paint on my shield
there is no occas seor for wast time or monei on make that
counten said sancho for all that need be done is for your
worship to show your own face to face to those who look at you and
without anyth more either imag or shield thei will call you him
of the rueful counten and believ me i am tell you the truth
for i assur you seor and in good part be it said hunger and the
loss of your grinder have given you such an illfavour face that as
i sai the rueful pictur mai be veri well spare
don quixot laugh at sancho pleasantri nevertheless he resolv to
call himself by that name and have hi shield or buckler paint as he
had devis
don quixot would have look to see whether the bodi in the litter
were bone or not but sancho would not have it sai
seor you have end thi peril adventur more safe for yourself
than ani of those i have seen perhap these peopl though beaten and
rout mai bethink themselv that it is a singl man that ha beaten
them and feel sore and asham of it mai take heart and come in
search of us and give us troubl enough the ass is in proper trim the
mountain ar near at hand hunger press we have noth more to do
but make good our retreat and as the sai is the dead to the grave
and the live to the loaf
and drive hi ass befor him he beg hi master to follow who
feel that sancho wa right did so without repli and after
proceed some littl distanc between two hill thei found themselv
in a wide and retir vallei where thei alight and sancho unload
hi beast and stretch upon the green grass with hunger for sauc
thei breakfast dine lunch and sup all at onc satisfi
their appetit with more than on store of cold meat which the dead
man cleric gentlemen who seldom put themselv on short allow
had brought with them on their sumpter mule but anoth piec of
illluck befel them which sancho held the worst of all and that wa
that thei had no wine to drink nor even water to moisten their lip
and as thirst torment them sancho observ that the meadow where
thei were wa full of green and tender grass said what will be told in
the follow chapter
chapter xx

valiant don quixot of la mancha with less peril than ani ever achiev
by ani famou knight in the world

it cannot be seor but that thi grass is a proof that there must be
hard by some spring or brook to give it moistur so it would be well
to move a littl farther on that we mai find some place where we mai
quench thi terribl thirst that plagu us which beyond a doubt is
more distress than hunger
the advic seem good to don quixot and he lead rocinant by the
bridl and sancho the ass by the halter after he had pack awai upon
him the remain of the supper thei advanc the meadow feel their
wai for the dark of the night made it imposs to see anyth
but thei had not gone two hundr pace when a loud nois of water as
if fall from great rock struck their ear the sound cheer them
greatli but halt to make out by listen from what quarter it came
thei heard unseason anoth nois which spoil the satisfact
the sound of the water gave them especi for sancho who wa by
natur timid and faintheart thei heard i sai stroke fall with
a measur beat and a certain rattl of iron and chain that
togeth with the furiou din of the water would have struck terror
into ani heart but don quixot the night wa as ha been said
dark and thei had happen to reach a spot in among some tall tree
whose leav stir by a gentl breez made a low omin sound so
that what with the solitud the place the dark the nois of the
water and the rustl of the leav everyth inspir aw and
dread more especi as thei perceiv that the stroke did not
ceas nor the wind lull nor morn approach to all which might be
ad their ignor as to where thei were

thi our iron ag to reviv in it the ag of gold or the golden as it
is call i am he for whom peril mighti achiev and valiant
deed ar reserv i am i sai again he who is to reviv the knight
of the round tabl the twelv of franc and the nine worthi and he
who is to consign to oblivion the platir the tablant the olivant
and tirant the phbuse and belianis with the whole herd of
famou knightserr of dai gone by perform in these in which i
live such exploit marvel and feat of arm as shall obscur their
brightest deed thou dost mark well faith and trusti squir the
gloom of thi night it strang silenc the dull confus murmur of
those tree the aw sound of that water in quest of which we came
that seem as though it were precipit and dash itself down from
the lofti mountain of the moon and that incess hammer that
wound and pain our ear which thing all togeth and each of itself
ar enough to instil fear dread and dismai into the breast of mar
himself much more into on not us to hazard and adventur of the
kind well then all thi that i put befor thee is but an incent
and stimul to my spirit make my heart burst in my bosom through
eager to engag in thi adventur arduou as it promis to be
therefor tighten rocinant girth a littl and god be with thee
wait for me here three dai and no more and if in that time i come not
back thou canst return to our villag and thenc to do me a favour
and a servic thou wilt go to el toboso where thou shalt sai to my
incompar ladi dulcinea that her captiv knight hath di in
attempt thing that might make him worthi of be call her
when sancho heard hi master word he began to weep in the most
pathet wai sai
seor i know not why your worship want to attempt thi so dread
adventur it is night now no on see us here we can easili turn
about and take ourselv out of danger even if we dont drink for
three dai to come and as there is no on to see us all the less will
there be anyon to set us down as coward besid i have mani a time
heard the curat of our villag whom your worship know well preach
that he who seek danger perish in it so it is not right to tempt
god by try so tremend a feat from which there can be no escap
save by a miracl and heaven ha perform enough of them for your
worship in deliv you from be blanket as i wa and bring
you out victori and safe and sound from among all those enemi that
were with the dead man and if all thi doe not move or soften that
hard heart let thi thought and reflect move it that you will have
hardli quit thi spot when from pure fear i shall yield my soul up
to anyon that will take it i left home and wife and children to come
and serv your worship trust to do better and not wors but as
covet burst the bag it ha rent my hope asund for just as
i had them highest about get that wretch unlucki island your
worship ha so often promis me i see that instead and in lieu of it
you mean to desert me now in a place so far from human reach for god
sake master mine deal not so unjustli by me and if your worship will
not entir give up attempt thi feat at least put it off till
morn for by what the lore i learn when i wa a shepherd tell me
it cannot want three hour of dawn now becaus the mouth of the horn
is overhead and make midnight in the line of the left arm
how canst thou see sancho said don quixot where it make that
line or where thi mouth or thi occiput is that thou talkest of when
the night is so dark that there is not a star to be seen in the whole
heaven
that true said sancho but fear ha sharp ey and see thing
underground much more abov in heaven besid there is good reason
to show that it now want but littl of dai
let it want what it mai repli don quixot it shall not be said
of me now or at ani time that tear or entreati turn me asid from
do what wa in accord with knightli usag and so i beg of thee
sancho to hold thy peac for god who ha put it into my heart to
undertak now thi so unexampl and terribl adventur will take care
to watch over my safeti and consol thy sorrow what thou hast to do is
to tighten rocinant girth well and wait here for i shall come
back shortli aliv or dead
sancho perceiv it hi master final resolv and how littl hi
tear counsel and entreati prevail with him determin to have
recours to hi own ingenu and compel him if he could to wait till
daylight and so while tighten the girth of the hors he quietli
and without be felt with hi ass halter ti both rocinant
leg so that when don quixot strove to go he wa unabl as the hors
could onli move by jump see the success of hi trick sancho panza
said
see there seor heaven move by my tear and prayer ha so
order it that rocinant cannot stir and if you will be obstin
and spur and strike him you will onli provok fortun and kick as
thei sai against the prick
don quixot at thi grew desper but the more he drove hi heel
into the hors the less he stir him and not have ani suspicion
of the ty he wa fain to resign himself and wait till daybreak or
until rocinant could move firmli persuad that all thi came of
someth other than sancho ingenu so he said to him as it is
so sancho and as rocinant cannot move i am content to wait till
dawn smile upon us even though i weep while it delai it come
there is no need to weep answer sancho for i will amus your
worship by tell stori from thi till daylight unless inde you
like to dismount and lie down to sleep a littl on the green grass
after the fashion of knightserr so as to be fresher when dai come
and the moment arriv for attempt thi extraordinari adventur you
ar look forward to
what art thou talk about dismount or sleep for said don
quixot am i thinkest thou on of those knight that take their
rest in the presenc of danger sleep thou who art born to sleep or do
as thou wilt for i will act as i think most consist with my
charact
be not angri master mine repli sancho i did not mean to sai
that and come close to him he laid on hand on the pommel of the
saddl and the other on the cantl so that he held hi master left
thigh in hi embrac not dare to separ a finger width from him
so much afraid wa he of the stroke which still resound with a
regular beat don quixot bade him tell some stori to amus him as he
had propos to which sancho repli that he would if hi dread of
what he heard would let him still said he i will strive to tell a
stori which if i can manag to relat it and nobodi interfer with
the tell is the best of stori and let your worship give me your
attent for here i begin what wa wa and mai the good that is to
come be for all and the evil for him who goe to look for ityour
worship must know that the begin the old folk us to put to their
tale wa not just as each on pleas it wa a maxim of cato
zonzorino the roman that sai the evil for him that goe to look for
it and it come as pat to the purpos now as ring to finger to show
that your worship should keep quiet and not go look for evil in ani
quarter and that we should go back by some other road sinc nobodi
forc us to follow thi in which so mani terror affright us
go on with thy stori sancho said don quixot and leav the choic
of our road to my care
i sai then continu sancho that in a villag of estremadura there
wa a goatshepherdthat is to sai on who tend goatswhich shepherd
or goatherd as my stori goe wa call lope ruiz and thi lope ruiz
wa in love with a shepherdess call torralva which shepherdess
call torralva wa the daughter of a rich grazier and thi rich
grazier
if that is the wai thou tellest thy tale sancho said don quixot
repeat twice all thou hast to sai thou wilt not have done these
two dai go straight on with it and tell it like a reason man or
els sai noth
tale ar alwai told in my countri in the veri wai i am tell
thi answer sancho and i cannot tell it in ani other nor is it
right of your worship to ask me to make new custom
tell it as thou wilt repli don quixot and as fate will have it
that i cannot help listen to thee go on
and so lord of my soul continu sancho as i have said thi
shepherd wa in love with torralva the shepherdess who wa a wild
buxom lass with someth of the look of a man about her for she had
littl moustach i fanci i see her now
then you knew her said don quixot
i did not know her said sancho but he who told me the stori said
it wa so true and certain that when i told it to anoth i might
safe declar and swear i had seen it all myself and so in cours of
time the devil who never sleep and put everyth in confus
contriv that the love the shepherd bore the shepherdess turn into
hatr and illwil and the reason accord to evil tongu wa
some littl jealousi she caus him that cross the line and
trespass on forbidden ground and so much did the shepherd hate her
from that time forward that in order to escap from her he determin
to quit the countri and go where he should never set ey on her again
torralva when she found herself spurn by lope wa immedi
smitten with love for him though she had never love him befor
that is the natur wai of women said don quixot to scorn the on
that love them and love the on that hate them go on sancho
it came to pass said sancho that the shepherd carri out hi
intent and drive hi goat befor him took hi wai across the
plain of estremadura to pass over into the kingdom of portug
torralva who knew of it went after him and on foot and barefoot
follow him at a distanc with a pilgrim staff in her hand and a
scrip round her neck in which she carri it is said a bit of
lookingglass and a piec of a comb and some littl pot or other of
paint for her face but let her carri what she did i am not go to
troubl myself to prove it all i sai is that the shepherd thei sai
came with hi flock to cross over the river guadiana which wa at that
time swollen and almost overflow it bank and at the spot he came
to there wa neither ferri nor boat nor anyon to carri him or hi
flock to the other side at which he wa much vex for he perceiv
that torralva wa approach and would give him great annoy with
her tear and entreati howev he went look about so close
that he discov a fisherman who had alongsid of him a boat so small
that it could onli hold on person and on goat but for all that he
spoke to him and agre with him to carri himself and hi three hundr
goat across the fisherman got into the boat and carri on goat
over he came back and carri anoth over he came back again and
again brought over anotherlet your worship keep count of the goat the
fisherman is take across for if on escap the memori there will be
an end of the stori and it will be imposs to tell anoth word of
it to proce i must tell you the land place on the other side wa
miri and slipperi and the fisherman lost a great deal of time in go
and come still he return for anoth goat and anoth and
anoth
take it for grant he brought them all across said don quixot
and dont keep go and come in thi wai or thou wilt not make an
end of bring them over thi twelvemonth
how mani have gone across so far said sancho
how the devil do i know repli don quixot
there it is said sancho what i told you that you must keep a good
count well then by god there is an end of the stori for there is no
go ani farther
how can that be said don quixot is it so essenti to the stori
to know to a niceti the goat that have cross over that if there be
a mistak of on in the reckon thou canst not go on with it
no seor not a bit repli sancho for when i ask your worship
to tell me how mani goat had cross and you answer you did not
know at that veri instant all i had to sai pass awai out of my
memori and faith there wa much virtu in it and entertain
so then said don quixot the stori ha come to an end
as much as my mother ha said sancho
in truth said don quixot thou hast told on of the rarest
stori tale or histori that anyon in the world could have
imagin and such a wai of tell it and end it wa never seen nor
will be in a lifetim though i expect noth els from thy
excel understand but i do not wonder for perhap those
ceaseless stroke mai have confus thy wit
all that mai be repli sancho but i know that as to my stori all
that can be said is that it end there where the mistak in the count
of the passag of the goat begin
let it end where it will well and good said don quixot and let
us see if rocinant can go and again he spur him and again
rocinant made jump and remain where he wa so well ti wa he
just then whether it wa the cold of the morn that wa now
approach or that he had eaten someth lax at supper or that
it wa onli natur as is most like sancho felt a desir to do
what no on could do for him but so great wa the fear that had
penetr hi heart he dare not separ himself from hi master by
as much as the black of hi nail to escap do what he want wa
howev also imposs so what he did for peac sake wa to remov
hi right hand which held the back of the saddl and with it to unti
gentli and silent the run string which alon held up hi
breech so that on loosen it thei at onc fell down round hi feet
like fetter he then rais hi shirt as well as he could and bare
hi hind quarter no slim on but thi accomplish which he
fanci wa all he had to do to get out of thi terribl strait and
embarrass anoth still greater difficulti present itself for
it seem to him imposs to reliev himself without make some
nois and he ground hi teeth and squeez hi shoulder togeth
hold hi breath as much as he could but in spite of hi precaut
he wa unlucki enough after all to make a littl nois veri differ
from that which wa caus him so much fear

don quixot hear it said what nois is that sancho
i dont know seor said he it must be someth new for
adventur and misadventur never begin with a trifl onc more he
tri hi luck and succeed so well that without ani further nois
or disturb he found himself reliev of the burden that had given
him so much discomfort but as don quixot sens of smell wa as
acut as hi hear and as sancho wa so close link with him that
the fume rose almost in a straight line it could not be but that some
should reach hi nose and as soon as thei did he came to it relief by
compress it between hi finger sai in a rather snuf tone
sancho it strike me thou art in great fear
i am answer sancho but how doe your worship perceiv it now
more than ever
becaus just now thou smellest stronger than ever and not of
ambergri answer don quixot
veri like said sancho but that not my fault but your
worship for lead me about at unseason hour and at such
unwont pace
then go back three or four my friend said don quixot all the time
with hi finger to hi nose and for the futur pai more attent to
thy person and to what thou owest to mine for it is my great
familiar with thee that ha bred thi contempt
ill bet repli sancho that your worship think i have done
someth i ought not with my person
it make it wors to stir it friend sancho return don quixot
with thi and other talk of the same sort master and man pass the
night till sancho perceiv that daybreak wa come on apac veri
cautious unti rocinant and ti up hi breech as soon as
rocinant found himself free though by natur he wa not at all
mettlesom he seem to feel live and began pawingfor as to
caper beg hi pardon he knew not what it meant don quixot
then observ that rocinant could move took it as a good sign and a
signal that he should attempt the dread adventur by thi time dai had
fulli broken and everyth show distinctli and don quixot saw that
he wa among some tall tree chestnut which cast a veri deep shade
he perceiv likewis that the sound of the stroke did not ceas but
could not discov what caus it and so without ani further delai he
let rocinant feel the spur and onc more take leav of sancho he
told him to wait for him there three dai at most as he had said
befor and if he should not have return by that time he might feel
sure it had been god will that he should end hi dai in that
peril adventur he again repeat the messag and commiss with
which he wa to go on hi behalf to hi ladi dulcinea and said he wa
not to be uneasi as to the payment of hi servic for befor leav
home he had made hi will in which he would find himself fulli
recompens in the matter of wage in due proport to the time he had
serv but if god deliv him safe sound and unhurt out of that
danger he might look upon the promis island as much more than
certain sancho began to weep afresh on again hear the affect
word of hi good master and resolv to stai with him until the final
issu and end of the busi from these tear and thi honour
resolv of sancho panza the author of thi histori infer that he
must have been of good birth and at least an old christian and the
feel he displai touch hi but not so much as to make him show
ani weak on the contrari hide what he felt as well as he could
he began to move toward that quarter whenc the sound of the water and
of the stroke seem to come
sancho follow him on foot lead by the halter as hi custom wa
hi ass hi constant comrad in prosper or advers and advanc
some distanc through the shadi chestnut tree thei came upon a littl
meadow at the foot of some high rock down which a mighti rush of
water flung itself at the foot of the rock were some rude
construct hous look more like ruin than hous from among
which came thei perceiv the din and clatter of blow which still
continu without intermiss rocinant took fright at the nois of
the water and of the blow but quiet him don quixot advanc step
by step toward the hous commend himself with all hi heart to
hi ladi implor her support in that dread pass and enterpris and
on the wai commend himself to god too not to forget him sancho
who never quit hi side stretch hi neck as far as he could and
peer between the leg of rocinant to see if he could now discov
what it wa that caus him such fear and apprehens thei went it
might be a hundr pace farther when on turn a corner the true
caus beyond the possibl of ani mistak of that dreadsound
and to them aweinspir nois that had kept them all the night in
such fear and perplex appear plain and obviou and it wa if
reader thou art not disgust and disappoint six full hammer
which by their altern stroke made all the din
when don quixot perceiv what it wa he wa struck dumb and rigid
from head to foot sancho glanc at him and saw him with hi head bent
down upon hi breast in manifest mortif and don quixot glanc
at sancho and saw him with hi cheek puf out and hi mouth full of
laughter and evid readi to explod with it and in spite of hi
vexat he could not help laugh at the sight of him and when
sancho saw hi master begin he let go so heartili that he had to hold
hi side with both hand to keep himself from burst with laughter
four time he stop and as mani time did hi laughter break out
afresh with the same violenc as at first whereat don quixot grew
furiou abov all when he heard him sai mockingli thou must know
friend sancho that of heaven will i wa born in thi our iron ag to
reviv in it the golden or ag of gold i am he for whom ar reserv
peril mighti achiev valiant deed and here he went on
repeat the word that don quixot utter the first time thei heard
the aw stroke
don quixot then see that sancho wa turn him into ridicul
wa so mortifi and vex that he lift up hi pike and smote him two
such blow that if instead of catch them on hi shoulder he had
caught them on hi head there would have been no wage to pai unless
inde to hi heir sancho see that he wa get an awkward
return in earnest for hi jest and fear hi master might carri it
still further said to him veri humbl calm yourself sir for by god
i am onli joke
well then if you ar joke i am not repli don quixot look
here my live gentleman if these instead of be full hammer
had been some peril adventur have i not think you shown the
courag requir for the attempt and achiev am i perchanc
be as i am a gentleman bound to know and distinguish sound and
tell whether thei come from full mill or not and that when
perhap as is the case i have never in my life seen ani as you have
low boor as you ar that have been born and bred among them but turn
me these six hammer into six giant and bring them to beard me on
by on or all togeth and if i do not knock them head over heel
then make what mockeri you like of me
no more of that seor return sancho i own i went a littl too
far with the joke but tell me your worship now that peac is made
between us and mai god bring you out of all the adventur that mai
befal you as safe and sound as he ha brought you out of thi on
wa it not a thing to laugh at and is it not a good stori the great
fear we were inat least that i wa in for as to your worship i see
now that you neither know nor understand what either fear or dismai
is
i do not deni said don quixot that what happen to us mai be
worth laugh at but it is not worth make a stori about for it is
not everyon that is shrewd enough to hit the right point of a thing
at ani rate said sancho your worship knew how to hit the right
point with your pike aim at my head and hit me on the
shoulder thank be to god and my own smart in dodg it but let
that pass all will come out in the scour for i have heard sai he
love thee well that make thee weep and moreov that it is the wai
with great lord after ani hard word thei give a servant to give him a
pair of breech though i do not know what thei give after blow
unless it be that knightserr after blow give island or kingdom
on the mainland
it mai be on the dice said don quixot that all thou sayest will
come true overlook the past for thou art shrewd enough to know that
our first movement ar not in our own control and on thing for the
futur bear in mind that thou curb and restrain thy loquac in my
compani for in all the book of chivalri that i have read and thei
ar innumer i never met with a squir who talk so much to hi
lord as thou dost to thine and in fact i feel it to be a great fault
of thine and of mine of thine that thou hast so littl respect for
me of mine that i do not make myself more respect there wa
gandalin the squir of amadi of gaul that wa count of the insula
firm and we read of him that he alwai address hi lord with hi
cap in hi hand hi head bow down and hi bodi bent doubl more
turquesco and then what shall we sai of gasab the squir of
galaor who wa so silent that in order to indic to us the great
of hi marvel taciturn hi name is onli onc mention in the
whole of that histori as long as it is truth from all i have said
thou wilt gather sancho that there must be a differ between
master and man between lord and lackei between knight and squir so

respect and take less liberti for in whatev wai i mai be provok
with you it will be bad for the pitcher the favour and benefit that
i have promis you will come in due time and if thei do not your
wage at least will not be lost as i have alreadi told you
all that your worship sai is veri well said sancho but i should
like to know in case the time of favour should not come and it might
be necessari to fall back upon wage how much did the squir of a
knighterr get in those dai and did thei agre by the month or by
the dai like bricklay
i do not believ repli don quixot that such squir were ever
on wage but were depend on favour and if i have now mention
thine in the seal will i have left at home it wa with a view to
what mai happen for as yet i know not how chivalri will turn out in
these wretch time of our and i do not wish my soul to suffer for
trifl in the other world for i would have thee know sancho that in
thi there is no condit more hazard than that of adventur
that is true said sancho sinc the mere nois of the hammer of a
full mill can disturb and disquiet the heart of such a valiant
errant adventur as your worship but you mai be sure i will not open
my lip henceforward to make light of anyth of your worship but
onli to honour you as my master and natur lord
by so do repli don quixot shalt thou live long on the face
of the earth for next to parent master ar to be respect as

it now began to rain a littl and sancho wa for go into the
full mill but don quixot had taken such an abhorr to them on
account of the late joke that he would not enter them on ani account
so turn asid to right thei came upon anoth road differ from
that which thei had taken the night befor shortli afterward don
quixot perceiv a man on horseback who wore on hi head someth
that shone like gold and the moment he saw him he turn to sancho and
said
i think sancho there is no proverb that is not true all be
maxim drawn from experi itself the mother of all the scienc
especi that on that sai where on door shut anoth open i
sai so becaus if last night fortun shut the door of the adventur we
were look for against us cheat us with the full mill it now
open wide anoth on for anoth better and more certain adventur
and if i do not contriv to enter it it will be my own fault and i
cannot lai it to my ignor of full mill or the dark of the
night i sai thi becaus if i mistak not there come toward us on
who wear on hi head the helmet of mambrino concern which i took
the oath thou rememberest
mind what you sai your worship and still more what you do said
sancho for i dont want ani more full mill to finish off full
and knock our sens out
the devil take thee man said don quixot what ha a helmet to do
with full mill
i dont know repli sancho but faith if i might speak as i
us perhap i could give such reason that your worship would see you
were mistaken in what you sai
how can i be mistaken in what i sai unbeliev traitor return
don quixot tell me seest thou not yonder knight come toward us
on a dappl grei steed who ha upon hi head a helmet of gold
what i see and make out answer sancho is onli a man on a grei
ass like my own who ha someth that shine on hi head
well that is the helmet of mambrino said don quixot stand to on
side and leav me alon with him thou shalt see how without sai a
word to save time i shall bring thi adventur to an issu and
possess myself of the helmet i have so long for
i will take care to stand asid said sancho but god grant i sai
onc more that it mai be marjoram and not full mill
i have told thee brother on no account to mention those full
mill to me again said don quixot or i vowand i sai no moreil
full the soul out of you
sancho held hi peac in dread lest hi master should carri out the vow
he had hurl like a bowl at him
the fact of the matter as regard the helmet steed and knight that
don quixot saw wa thi in that neighbourhood there were two
villag on of them so small that it had neither apothecari shop
nor barber which the other that wa close to it had so the barber of
the larger serv the smaller and in it there wa a sick man who
requir to be bled and anoth man who want to be shave and on
thi errand the barber wa go carri with him a brass basin but
as luck would have it as he wa on the wai it began to rain and not
to spoil hi hat which probabl wa a new on he put the basin on hi
head and be clean it glitter at half a leagu distanc he rode
upon a grei ass as sancho said and thi wa what made it seem to don
quixot to be a dapplegrei steed and a knight and a golden helmet for
everyth he saw he made to fall in with hi crazi chivalri and
illerr notion and when he saw the poor knight draw near without
enter into ani parlei with him at rocinant top speed he bore
down upon him with the pike point low fulli determin to run him
through and through and as he reach him without check the furi
of hi charg he cri to him
defend thyself miser be or yield me of thine own accord that
which is so reason my due
the barber who without ani expect or apprehens of it saw thi
apparit come down upon him had no other wai of save himself
from the stroke of the lanc but to let himself fall off hi ass and
no sooner had he touch the ground than he sprang up more nimbl than
a deer and sped awai across the plain faster than the wind
he left the basin on the ground with which don quixot content
himself sai that the pagan had shown hi discret and imit
the beaver which find itself press by the hunter bite and cut
off with it teeth that for which by it natur instinct it know it
is pursu
he told sancho to pick up the helmet and he take it in hi hand
said
by god the basin is a good on and worth a real of eight if it is
worth a maravedi and hand it to hi master who immedi put it
on hi head turn it round now thi wai now that in search of
fitment and not find it he said clearli the pagan to whose
measur thi famou headpiec wa first forg must have had a veri
larg head but the worst of it is half of it is want
when sancho heard him call the basin a headpiec he wa unabl to
restrain hi laughter but rememb hi master wrath he check
himself in the midst of it
what art thou laugh at sancho said don quixot
i am laugh said he to think of the great head the pagan must
have had who own thi helmet for it look exactli like a regular
barber basin
dost thou know what i suspect sancho said don quixot that thi
wonder piec of thi enchant helmet must by some strang accid
have come into the hand of someon who wa unabl to recognis or
realis it valu and who not know what he did and see it to
be of the purest gold must have melt down on half for the sake of
what it might be worth and of the other made thi which is like a
barber basin as thou sayest but be it as it mai to me who recognis
it it transform make no differ for i will set it to right
at the first villag where there is a blacksmith and in such style
that that helmet the god of smithi forg for the god of battl
shall not surpass it or even come up to it and in the meantim i will
wear it as well as i can for someth is better than noth all the
more as it will be quit enough to protect me from ani chanc blow of a
stone
that is said sancho if it is not shot with a sling as thei were in
the battl of the two armi when thei sign the cross on your
worship grinder and smash the flask with that bless draught that
made me vomit my bowel up
it doe not griev me much to have lost it said don quixot for
thou knowest sancho that i have the receipt in my memori
so have i answer sancho but if ever i make it or try it again
as long as i live mai thi be my last hour moreov i have no
intent of put myself in the wai of want it for i mean with
all my five sens to keep myself from be wound or from wound
anyon as to be blanket again i sai noth for it is hard to
prevent mishap of that sort and if thei come there is noth for it
but to squeez our shoulder togeth hold our breath shut our ey
and let ourselv go where luck and the blanket mai send us
thou art a bad christian sancho said don quixot on hear thi
for onc an injuri ha been done thee thou never forgettest it but
know that it is the part of nobl and gener heart not to attach
import to trifl what lame leg hast thou got by it what broken
rib what crack head that thou canst not forget that jest for jest
and sport it wa properli regard and had i not seen it in that
light i would have return and done more mischief in reveng thee
than the greek did for the rape of helen who if she were aliv now
or if my dulcinea had live then might depend upon it she would not be
so famou for her beauti as she is and here he heav a sigh and sent
it aloft and said sancho let it pass for a jest as it cannot be
reveng in earnest but i know what sort of jest and earnest it wa
and i know it will never be rub out of my memori ani more than off
my shoulder but put that asid will your worship tell me what
ar we to do with thi dapplegrei steed that look like a grei ass
which that martino that your worship overthrew ha left desert here
for from the wai he took to hi heel and bolt he is not like
ever to come back for it and by my beard but the grei is a good on
i have never been in the habit said don quixot of take spoil of
those whom i vanquish nor is it the practic of chivalri to take awai
their hors and leav them to go on foot unless inde it be that the
victor have lost hi own in the combat in which case it is law to
take that of the vanquish as a thing won in law war therefor
sancho leav thi hors or ass or whatev thou wilt have it to be
for when it owner see us gone henc he will come back for it
god know i should like to take it return sancho or at least to
chang it for my own which doe not seem to me as good a on verili
the law of chivalri ar strict sinc thei cannot be stretch to let
on ass be chang for anoth i should like to know if i might at
least chang trap
on that head i am not quit certain answer don quixot and the
matter be doubt pend better inform i sai thou mayest
chang them if so be thou hast urgent need of them
so urgent is it answer sancho that if thei were for my own
person i could not want them more and forthwith fortifi by thi
licenc he effect the mutatio capparum and rig out hi beast
to the ninetynin and make quit anoth thing of it thi done
thei broke their fast on the remain of the spoil of war plunder
from the sumpter mule and drank of the brook that flow from the
full mill without cast a look in that direct in such
loath did thei hold them for the alarm thei had caus them and
all anger and gloom remov thei mount and without take ani fix
road not to fix upon ani be the proper thing for true
knightserr thei set out guid by rocinant will which
carri along with it that of hi master not to sai that of the ass
which alwai follow him wherev he led lovingli and sociabl
nevertheless thei return to the high road and pursu it at a
ventur without ani other aim
as thei went along then in thi wai sancho said to hi master
seor would your worship give me leav to speak a littl to you for
sinc you laid that hard injunct of silenc on me sever thing
have gone to rot in my stomach and i have now just on on the tip of
my tongu that i dont want to be spoil
sai on sancho said don quixot and be brief in thy discours
for there is no pleasur in on that is long
well then seor return sancho i sai that for some dai past i
have been consid how littl is got or gain by go in search of
these adventur that your worship seek in these wild and
crossroad where even if the most peril ar victori
achiev there is no on to see or know of them and so thei must be
left untold for ever to the loss of your worship object and the
credit thei deserv therefor it seem to me it would be better
save your worship better judgment if we were to go and serv some
emperor or other great princ who mai have some war on hand in whose
servic your worship mai prove the worth of your person your great
might and greater understand on perceiv which the lord in whose
servic we mai be will perforc have to reward us each accord to
hi merit and there you will not be at a loss for someon to set down
your achiev in write so as to preserv their memori for ever
of my own i sai noth as thei will not go beyond squir limit
though i make bold to sai that if it be the practic in chivalri to
write the achiev of squir i think mine must not be left out
thou speakest not amiss sancho answer don quixot but befor
that point is reach it is requisit to roam the world as it were on
probat seek adventur in order that by achiev some name
and fame mai be acquir such that when he betak himself to the
court of some great monarch the knight mai be alreadi known by hi
deed and that the boi the instant thei see him enter the gate of
the citi mai all follow him and surround him cry thi is the
knight of the sunor the serpent or ani other titl under which he
mai have achiev great deed thi thei will sai is he who
vanquish in singl combat the gigant brocabruno of mighti strength
he who deliv the great mameluk of persia out of the long
enchant under which he had been for almost nine hundr year so
from on to anoth thei will go proclaim hi achiev and
present at the tumult of the boi and the other the king of that
kingdom will appear at the window of hi royal palac and as soon as
he behold the knight recognis him by hi arm and the devic on
hi shield he will as a matter of cours sai what ho forth all ye
the knight of my court to receiv the flower of chivalri who cometh
hither at which command all will issu forth and he himself
advanc halfwai down the stair will embrac him close and
salut him kiss him on the cheek and will then lead him to the
queen chamber where the knight will find her with the princess her
daughter who will be on of the most beauti and accomplish
damsel that could with the utmost pain be discov anywher in the
known world straightwai it will come to pass that she will fix her
ey upon the knight and he hi upon her and each will seem to the
other someth more divin than human and without know how or why
thei will be taken and entangl in the inextric toil of love and
sore distress in their heart not to see ani wai of make their
pain and suffer known by speech thenc thei will lead him no
doubt to some richli adorn chamber of the palac where have
remov hi armour thei will bring him a rich mantl of scarlet
wherewith to robe himself and if he look nobl in hi armour he will
look still more so in a doublet when night come he will sup with the
king queen and princess and all the time he will never take hi ey
off her steal stealthi glanc unnot by those present and she
will do the same and with equal cautious be as i have said a
damsel of great discret the tabl be remov suddenli through
the door of the hall there will enter a hideou and diminut dwarf
follow by a fair dame between two giant who come with a certain
adventur the work of an ancient sage and he who shall achiev it
shall be deem the best knight in the world
the king will then command all those present to essai it and none
will bring it to an end and conclus save the stranger knight to the
great enhanc of hi fame whereat the princess will be overjoi
and will esteem herself happi and fortun in have fix and place
her thought so high and the best of it is that thi king or princ
or whatev he is is engag in a veri bitter war with anoth as
power as himself and the stranger knight after have been some
dai at hi court request leav from him to go and serv him in the
said war the king will grant it veri readili and the knight will
courteous kiss hi hand for the favour done to him and that night
he will take leav of hi ladi the princess at the grate of the
chamber where she sleep which look upon a garden and at which he
ha alreadi mani time convers with her the gobetween and
confidant in the matter be a damsel much trust by the princess
he will sigh she will swoon the damsel will fetch water much
distress becaus morn approach and for the honour of her ladi
he would not that thei were discov at last the princess will come
to herself and will present her white hand through the grate to the
knight who will kiss them a thousand and a thousand time bath
them with hi tear it will be arrang between them how thei ar to
inform each other of their good or evil fortun and the princess will
entreat him to make hi absenc as short as possibl which he will
promis to do with mani oath onc more he kiss her hand and take
hi leav in such grief that he is wellnigh readi to die he betak
him thenc to hi chamber fling himself on hi bed cannot sleep for
sorrow at part rise earli in the morn goe to take leav of
the king queen and princess and as he take hi leav of the pair
it is told him that the princess is indispos and cannot receiv a
visit the knight think it is from grief at hi departur hi heart
is pierc and he is hardli abl to keep from show hi pain the
confidant is present observ all goe to tell her mistress who
listen with tear and sai that on of her greatest distress is not
know who thi knight is and whether he is of kingli lineag or not
the damsel assur her that so much courtesi gentl and gallantri
of bear as her knight possess could not exist in ani save on who
wa royal and illustri her anxieti is thu reliev and she
strive to be of good cheer lest she should excit suspicion in her
parent and at the end of two dai she appear in public meanwhil
the knight ha taken hi departur he fight in the war conquer the
king enemi win mani citi triumph in mani battl return to
the court see hi ladi where he wa wont to see her and it is agre
that he shall demand her in marriag of her parent as the reward of
hi servic the king is unwil to give her as he know not who he
is but nevertheless whether carri off or in whatev other wai it
mai be the princess come to be hi bride and her father come to
regard it as veri good fortun for it so happen that thi knight is
prove to be the son of a valiant king of some kingdom i know not
what for i fanci it is not like to be on the map the father di
the princess inherit and in two word the knight becom king and
here come in at onc the bestow of reward upon hi squir and all
who have aid him in rise to so exalt a rank he marri hi
squir to a damsel of the princesss who will be no doubt the on
who wa confidant in their amour and is daughter of a veri great
duke
that what i want and no mistak about it said sancho that
what im wait for for all thi word for word is in store for your
worship under the titl of the knight of the rueful counten
thou needst not doubt it sancho repli don quixot for in the
same manner and by the same step as i have describ here
knightserr rise and have risen to be king and emperor all we
want now is to find out what king christian or pagan is at war and
ha a beauti daughter but there will be time enough to think of
that for as i have told thee fame must be won in other quarter
befor repair to the court there is anoth thing too that is
want for suppos we find a king who is at war and ha a beauti
daughter and that i have won incred fame throughout the univers
i know not how it can be made out that i am of royal lineag or even
second cousin to an emperor for the king will not be will to give
me hi daughter in marriag unless he is first thoroughli satisfi on
thi point howev much my famou deed mai deserv it so that by
thi defici i fear i shall lose what my arm ha fairli earn true
it is i am a gentleman of known hous of estat and properti and
entitl to the five hundr sueldo mulet and it mai be that the sage
who shall write my histori will so clear up my ancestri and pedigre
that i mai find myself fifth or sixth in descent from a king for i
would have thee know sancho that there ar two kind of lineag in
the world some there be trace and deriv their descent from king
and princ whom time ha reduc littl by littl until thei end in a
point like a pyramid upsid down and other who spring from the common
herd and go on rise step by step until thei come to be great lord
so that the differ is that the on were what thei no longer ar
and the other ar what thei formerli were not and i mai be of such
that after investig my origin mai prove great and famou with
which the king my fatherinlaw that is to be ought to be satisfi
and should he not be the princess will so love me that even though she
well knew me to be the son of a watercarri she will take me for her
lord and husband in spite of her father if not then it come to
seiz her and carri her off where i pleas for time or death will
put an end to the wrath of her parent
it come to thi too said sancho what some naughti peopl sai
never ask as a favour what thou canst take by forc though it would
fit better to sai a clear escap is better than good men prayer
i sai so becaus if my lord the king your worship fatherinlaw
will not condescend to give you my ladi the princess there is noth
for it but as your worship sai to seiz her and transport her but
the mischief is that until peac is made and you come into the peac
enjoy of your kingdom the poor squir is famish as far as
reward go unless it be that the confidant damsel that is to be hi
wife come with the princess and that with her he tide over hi bad
luck until heaven otherwis order thing for hi master i suppos
mai as well give her to him at onc for a law wife
nobodi can object to that said don quixot
then sinc that mai be said sancho there is noth for it but to
commend ourselv to god and let fortun take what cours it will
god guid it accord to my wish and thy want said don quixot
and mean be he who think himself mean
in god name let him be so said sancho i am an old christian and
to fit me for a count that enough
and more than enough for thee said don quixot and even wert thou
not it would make no differ becaus i be the king can easili
give thee nobil without purchas or servic render by thee for
when i make thee a count then thou art at onc a gentleman and thei
mai sai what thei will but by my faith thei will have to call thee
your lordship whether thei like it or not
not a doubt of it and ill know how to support the tittl said
sancho
titl thou shouldst sai not tittl said hi master
so be it answer sancho i sai i will know how to behav for onc
in my life i wa beadl of a brotherhood and the beadl gown sat so
well on me that all said i look as if i wa to be steward of the same
brotherhood what will it be then when i put a duke robe on my
back or dress myself in gold and pearl like a count i believ
theyll come a hundr leagu to see me
thou wilt look well said don quixot but thou must shave thy beard
often for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt that if thou
dost not shave it everi second dai at least thei will see what thou
art at the distanc of a musket shot
what more will it be said sancho than have a barber and keep
him at wage in the hous and even if it be necessari i will make him
go behind me like a nobleman equerri
why how dost thou know that noblemen have equerri behind them
ask don quixot
i will tell you answer sancho year ago i wa for a month at the
capit and there i saw take the air a veri small gentleman who thei
said wa a veri great man and a man follow him on horseback in
everi turn he took just as if he wa hi tail i ask why thi man
did not join the other man instead of alwai go behind him thei
answer me that he wa hi equerri and that it wa the custom with
nobl to have such person behind them and ever sinc then i know it
for i have never forgotten it
thou art right said don quixot and in the same wai thou mayest
carri thy barber with thee for custom did not come into us all
togeth nor were thei all invent at onc and thou mayest be the
first count to have a barber to follow him and inde shave on
beard is a greater trust than saddl on hors
let the barber busi be my lookout said sancho and your
worship be it to strive to becom a king and make me a count
so it shall be answer don quixot and rais hi ey he saw

twentyon don quixot rais hi ey and saw come along the road
he wa follow some dozen men on foot strung togeth by the neck
like bead on a great iron chain and all with manacl on their
hand with them there came also two men on horseback and two on foot
those on horseback with wheellock musket those on foot with javelin
and sword and as soon as sancho saw them he said
that is a chain of gallei slave on the wai to the gallei by forc
of the king order
how by forc ask don quixot is it possibl that the king us
forc against anyon
i do not sai that answer sancho but that these ar peopl
condemn for their crime to serv by forc in the king gallei
in fact repli don quixot howev it mai be these peopl ar
go where thei ar take them by forc and not of their own will
just so said sancho
then if so said don quixot here is a case for the exercis of my
offic to put down forc and to succour and help the wretch
recollect your worship said sancho justic which is the king
himself is not us forc or do wrong to such person but
punish them for their crime
the chain of gallei slave had by thi time come up and don quixot in

good enough to tell him the reason or reason for which thei were

nevertheless repli don quixot i should like to know from each
of them separ the reason of hi misfortun to thi he ad more
to the same effect to induc them to tell him what he want so civilli
that the other mount guard said to him
though we have here the regist and certif of the sentenc of
everi on of these wretch thi is no time to take them out or read
them come and ask themselv thei can tell if thei choos and thei
will for these fellow take a pleasur in do and talk about
rascal
with thi permiss which don quixot would have taken even had thei
not grant it he approach the chain and ask the first for what
offenc he wa now in such a sorri case
he made answer that it wa for be a lover
for that onli repli don quixot why if for be lover thei
send peopl to the gallei i might have been row in them long ago
the love is not the sort your worship is think of said the gallei
slave mine wa that i love a washerwoman basket of clean linen so
well and held it so close in my embrac that if the arm of the law
had not forc it from me i should never have let it go of my own will
to thi moment i wa caught in the act there wa no occas for
tortur the case wa settl thei treat me to a hundr lash on
the back and three year of gurapa besid and that wa the end of
it
what ar gurapa ask don quixot
gurapa ar gallei answer the gallei slave who wa a young man
of about fourandtwenti and said he wa a nativ of piedrahita
don quixot ask the same question of the second who made no repli
so downcast and melancholi wa he but the first answer for him and
said he sir goe as a canari i mean as a musician and a singer
what said don quixot for be musician and singer ar peopl
sent to the gallei too
ye sir answer the gallei slave for there is noth wors than
sing under suffer
on the contrari i have heard sai said don quixot that he who
sing scare awai hi woe
here it is the revers said the gallei slave for he who sing onc
weep all hi life
i do not understand it said don quixot but on of the guard said
to him sir to sing under suffer mean with the non sancta
fratern to confess under tortur thei put thi sinner to the
tortur and he confess hi crime which wa be a cuatrero that is
a cattlesteal and on hi confess thei sentenc him to six year
in the gallei besid two hundr lash that he ha alreadi had on
the back and he is alwai deject and downcast becaus the other
thiev that were left behind and that march here illtreat and snub
and jeer and despis him for confess and not have spirit enough
to sai nai for sai thei nai ha no more letter in it than yea
and a culprit is well off when life or death with him depend on hi
own tongu and not on that of wit or evid and to my think
thei ar not veri far out
and i think so too answer don quixot then pass on to the
third he ask him what he had ask the other and the man answer
veri readili and unconcernedli i am go for five year to their
ladyship the gurapa for the want of ten ducat
i will give twenti with pleasur to get you out of that troubl said
don quixot
that said the gallei slave is like a man have monei at sea when
he is dy of hunger and ha no wai of bui what he want i sai so
becaus if at the right time i had had those twenti ducat that your
worship now offer me i would have greas the notari pen and
freshen up the attornei wit with them so that todai i should be
in the middl of the plaza of the zocodov at toledo and not on thi
road coupl like a greyhound but god is great patiencether that
enough of it
don quixot pass on to the fourth a man of vener aspect with a
white beard fall below hi breast who on hear himself ask the
reason of hi be there began to weep without answer a word but
the fifth act as hi tongu and said thi worthi man is go to
the gallei for four year after have gone the round in ceremoni
and on horseback
that mean said sancho panza as i take it to have been expos to
shame in public
just so repli the gallei slave and the offenc for which thei
gave him that punish wa have been an earbrok nai
bodybrok i mean in short that thi gentleman goe as a pimp and
for have besid a certain touch of the sorcer about him
if that touch had not been thrown in said don quixot he would not
deserv for mere pimp to row in the gallei but rather to command
and be admir of them for the offic of pimp is no ordinari on
be the offic of person of discret on veri necessari in a
wellord state and onli to be exercis by person of good birth
nai there ought to be an inspector and overs of them as in other
offic and recognis number as with the broker on chang in thi
wai mani of the evil would be avoid which ar caus by thi offic
and call be in the hand of stupid and ignor peopl such as
women more or less silli and page and jester of littl stand and
experi who on the most urgent occas and when ingenu of
contriv is need let the crumb freez on the wai to their
mouth and know not which is their right hand i should like to go
farther and give reason to show that it is advis to choos those
who ar to hold so necessari an offic in the state but thi is not
the fit place for it some dai i will expound the matter to someon
abl to see to and rectifi it all i sai now is that the addit
fact of hi be a sorcer ha remov the sorrow it gave me to see
these white hair and thi vener counten in so pain a
posit on account of hi be a pimp though i know well there ar
no sorceri in the world that can move or compel the will as some
simpl folk fanci for our will is free nor is there herb or charm
that can forc it all that certain silli women and quack do is to
turn men mad with potion and poison pretend that thei have power
to caus love for as i sai it is an imposs to compel the
will
it is true said the good old man and inde sir as far as the
charg of sorceri goe i wa not guilti as to that of be a pimp i
cannot deni it but i never thought i wa do ani harm by it for my
onli object wa that all the world should enjoi itself and live in
peac and quiet without quarrel or troubl but my good intent
were unavail to save me from go where i never expect to come back
from with thi weight of year upon me and a urinari ailment that
never give me a moment eas and again he fell to weep as
befor and such compass did sancho feel for him that he took out a
real of four from hi bosom and gave it to him in alm
don quixot went on and ask anoth what hi crime wa and the man
answer with no less but rather much more sprightli than the last
on
i am here becaus i carri the joke too far with a coupl of cousin
of mine and with a coupl of other cousin who were none of mine in
short i carri the joke so far with them all that it end in such a
complic increas of kindr that no account could make it clear
it wa all prove against me i got no favour i had no monei i wa
near have my neck stretch thei sentenc me to the gallei for six
year i accept my fate it is the punish of my fault i am a
young man let life onli last and with that all will come right if
you sir have anyth wherewith to help the poor god will repai it
to you in heaven and we on earth will take care in our petit to

keepfriend or friend foot from which hung two iron reach to
hi waist with two manacl fix to them in which hi hand were
secur by a big padlock so that he could neither rais hi hand to
hi mouth nor lower hi head to hi hand don quixot ask why thi
man carri so mani more chain than the other the guard repli that
it wa becaus he alon had commit more crime than all the rest put

march him in that fashion thei did not feel sure of him but were in
dread of hi make hi escap
what crime can he have commit said don quixot if thei have

the commissari if you dont want me to make you hold your tongu in

he sai true said the commissari for he ha himself written hi
stori as grand as you pleas and ha left the book in the prison in
pawn for two hundr real
and i mean to take it out of pawn said gine though it were in for
two hundr ducat
is it so good said don quixot
so good is it repli gine that a fig for lazarillo de torm
and all of that kind that have been written or shall be written
compar with it all i will sai about it is that it deal with fact
and fact so neat and divert that no li could match them
and how is the book entitl ask don quixot

and is it finish ask don quixot
how can it be finish said the other when my life is not yet
finish all that is written is from my birth down to the point when
thei sent me to the gallei thi last time
then you have been there befor said don quixot
in the servic of god and the king i have been there for four year
befor now and i know by thi time what the biscuit and courbash ar
like repli gine and it is no great grievanc to me to go back to
them for there i shall have time to finish my book i have still mani
thing left to sai and in the gallei of spain there is more than
enough leisur though i do not want much for what i have to write for
i have it by heart
you seem a clever fellow said don quixot
and an unfortun on repli gine for misfortun alwai

i told you alreadi to go gentli master commissari said pasamont
their lordship yonder never gave you that staff to illtreat us
wretch here but to conduct and take us where hi majesti order you
if not by the life ofnev mind it mai be that some dai the stain
made in the inn will come out in the scour let everyon hold hi
tongu and behav well and speak better and now let us march on for
we have had quit enough of thi entertain
the commissari lift hi staff to strike pasamont in return for hi
threat but don quixot came between them and beg him not to
illus him as it wa not too much to allow on who had hi hand ti
to have hi tongu a trifl free and turn to the whole chain of
them he said
from all you have told me dear brethren i make out clearli that
though thei have punish you for your fault the punish you ar
about to endur do not give you much pleasur and that you go to them
veri much against the grain and against your will and that perhap
thi on want of courag under tortur that on want of monei the
other want of advocaci and lastli the pervert judgment of the
judg mai have been the caus of your ruin and of your failur to
obtain the justic you had on your side all which present itself now
to my mind urg persuad and even compel me to demonstr
in your case the purpos for which heaven sent me into the world and
caus me to make profess of the order of chivalri to which i
belong and the vow i took therein to give aid to those in need and
under the oppress of the strong but as i know that it is a mark of
prudenc not to do by foul mean what mai be done by fair i will ask
these gentlemen the guard and commissari to be so good as to releas
you and let you go in peac as there will be no lack of other to
serv the king under more favour circumst for it seem to me
a hard case to make slave of those whom god and natur have made free
moreov sir of the guard ad don quixot these poor fellow
have done noth to you let each answer for hi own sin yonder
there is a god in heaven who will not forget to punish the wick or
reward the good and it is not fit that honest men should be the
instrument of punish to other thei be therein no wai
concern thi request i make thu gentli and quietli that if you
compli with it i mai have reason for thank you and if you will
not voluntarili thi lanc and sword togeth with the might of my arm
shall compel you to compli with it by forc
nice nonsens said the commissari a fine piec of pleasantri he
ha come out with at last he want us to let the king prison go
as if we had ani author to releas them or he to order us to do so
go your wai sir and good luck to you put that basin straight that
youv got on your head and dont go look for three feet on a cat
ti you that ar the cat rat and rascal repli don quixot and
act on the word he fell upon him so suddenli that without give him
time to defend himself he brought him to the ground sore wound with
a lancethrust and lucki it wa for him that it wa the on that had
the musket the other guard stood thunderstruck and amaz at thi
unexpect event but recov presenc of mind those on horseback
seiz their sword and those on foot their javelin and attack don
quixot who wa wait for them with great calm and no doubt it
would have gone badli with him if the gallei slave see the chanc
befor them of liber themselv had not effect it by contriv
to break the chain on which thei were strung such wa the confus
that the guard now rush at the gallei slave who were break
loos now to attack don quixot who wa wait for them did noth
at all that wa of ani us sancho on hi part gave a help hand to
releas gine de pasamont who wa the first to leap forth upon the
plain free and unfett and who attack the prostrat commissari
took from him hi sword and the musket with which aim at on and
level at anoth he without ever discharg it drove everi on
of the guard off the field for thei took to flight as well to escap
pasamont musket as the shower of stone the now releas gallei
slave were rain upon them sancho wa greatli griev at the
affair becaus he anticip that those who had fled would report the
matter to the holi brotherhood who at the summon of the alarmbel
would at onc salli forth in quest of the offend and he said so to
hi master and entreat him to leav the place at onc and go into
hide in the sierra that wa close by
that is all veri well said don quixot but i know what must be
done now and call togeth all the gallei slave who were now
run riot and had strip the commissari to the skin he collect
them round him to hear what he had to sai and address them as
follow to be grate for benefit receiv is the part of person
of good birth and on of the sin most offens to god is
ingratitud i sai so becaus sir ye have alreadi seen by manifest
proof the benefit ye have receiv of me in return for which i desir
and it is my good pleasur that laden with that chain which i have
taken off your neck ye at onc set out and proce to the citi of el
toboso and there present yourselv befor the ladi dulcinea del
toboso and sai to her that her knight he of the rueful counten
send to commend himself to her and that ye recount to her in full
detail all the particular of thi notabl adventur up to the
recoveri of your longedfor liberti and thi done ye mai go where ye
will and good fortun attend you
gine de pasamont made answer for all sai that which you sir
our deliver demand of us is of all imposs the most
imposs to compli with becaus we cannot go togeth along the
road but onli singli and separ and each on hi own wai
endeavour to hide ourselv in the bowel of the earth to escap the
holi brotherhood which no doubt will come out in search of us what
your worship mai do and fairli do is to chang thi servic and
tribut as regard the ladi dulcinea del toboso for a certain quantiti
of avemaria and credo which we will sai for your worship
intent and thi is a condit that can be compli with by night
as by dai run or rest in peac or in war but to imagin that
we ar go now to return to the fleshpot of egypt i mean to take
up our chain and set out for el toboso is to imagin that it is now
night though it is not yet ten in the morn and to ask thi of us
is like ask pear of the elm tree
then by all that good said don quixot now stir to wrath
don son of a bitch don ginesillo de paropillo or whatev your name
is you will have to go yourself alon with your tail between your
leg and the whole chain on your back
pasamont who wa anyth but meek be by thi time thoroughli
convinc that don quixot wa not quit right in hi head as he had
commit such a vagari as to set them free find himself abus in
thi fashion gave the wink to hi companion and fall back thei
began to shower stone on don quixot at such a rate that he wa quit
unabl to protect himself with hi buckler and poor rocinant no more
heed the spur than if he had been made of brass sancho plant
himself behind hi ass and with him shelter himself from the
hailstorm that pour on both of them don quixot wa unabl to shield
himself so well but that more pebbl than i could count struck him
full on the bodi with such forc that thei brought him to the ground
and the instant he fell the student pounc upon him snatch the
basin from hi head and with it struck three or four blow on hi
shoulder and as mani more on the ground knock it almost to

with what dappl us to carri empti the sack and pack hi
paunch and so long as he could go that wai he would not have given a
farth to meet with anoth adventur
while so engag he rais hi ey and saw that hi master had halt
and wa try with the point of hi pike to lift some bulki object
that lai upon the ground on which he hasten to join him and help him
if it were need and reach him just as with the point of the pike
he wa rais a saddlepad with a valis attach to it half or
rather wholli rotten and torn but so heavi were thei that sancho had
to help to take them up and hi master direct him to see what the
valis contain sancho did so with great alacr and though the
valis wa secur by a chain and padlock from it torn and rotten
condit he wa abl to see it content which were four shirt of
fine holland and other articl of linen no less curiou than clean
and in a handkerchief he found a good lot of gold crown and as soon
as he saw them he exclaim
bless be all heaven for send us an adventur that is good for
someth
search further he found a littl memorandum book richli bound thi
don quixot ask of him tell him to take the monei and keep it for
himself sancho kiss hi hand for the favour and clear the valis
of it linen which he stow awai in the provis sack consid
the whole matter don quixot observ
it seem to me sanchoand it is imposs it can be otherwisethat
some strai travel must have cross thi sierra and been attack
and slain by footpad who brought him to thi remot spot to buri
him
that cannot be answer sancho becaus if thei had been robber
thei would not have left thi monei
thou art right said don quixot and i cannot guess or explain what
thi mai mean but stai let us see if in thi memorandum book there is
anyth written by which we mai be abl to trace out or discov what
we want to know

there is noth to be learn from that rhyme said sancho unless
by that clue there in it on mai draw out the ball of the whole

what clue is there said don quixot
i thought your worship spoke of a clue in it said sancho
i onli said chloe repli don quixot and that no doubt is the
name of the ladi of whom the author of the sonnet complain and
faith he must be a toler poet or i know littl of the craft
then your worship understand rhyme too
and better than thou thinkest repli don quixot as thou shalt
see when thou carriest a letter written in vers from begin to end
to my ladi dulcinea del toboso for i would have thee know sancho
that all or most of the knightserr in dai of yore were great
troubadour and great musician for both of these accomplish or
more properli speak gift ar the peculiar properti of
loverserr true it is that the vers of the knight of old have
more spirit than neat in them
read more your worship said sancho and you will find someth
that will enlighten us
don quixot turn the page and said thi is prose and seem to be a
letter
a correspond letter seor
from the begin it seem to be a love letter repli don quixot
then let your worship read it aloud said sancho for i am veri fond
of love matter
with all my heart said don quixot and read it aloud as sancho
had request him he found it ran thu
thy fals promis and my sure misfortun carri me to a place whenc the
new of my death will reach thy ear befor the word of my complaint
ungrat on thou hast reject me for on more wealthi but not
more worthi but if virtu were esteem wealth i should neither envi

an angel by them i know thou art a woman peac be with thee who hast
sent war to me and heaven grant that the deceit of thy husband be ever
hidden from thee so that thou repent not of what thou hast done and i
reap not a reveng i would not have
when he had finish the letter don quixot said there is less to be
gather from thi than from the vers except that he who wrote it is
some reject lover and turn over nearli all the page of the book
he found more vers and letter some of which he could read while
other he could not but thei were all made up of complaint lament
misgiv desir and avers favour and reject some
raptur some dole while don quixot examin the book sancho
examin the valis not leav a corner in the whole of it or in the
pad that he did not search peer into and explor or seam that he did
not rip or tuft of wool that he did not pick to piec lest anyth
should escap for want of care and pain so keen wa the covet
excit in him by the discoveri of the crown which amount to near a
hundr and though he found no more booti he held the blanket
flight balsam vomit stake benedict carrier fisticuff
miss alforja stolen coat and all the hunger thirst and
weari he had endur in the servic of hi good master cheap at
the price as he consid himself more than fulli indemnifi for all
by the payment he receiv in the gift of the treasuretrov
the knight of the rueful counten wa still veri anxiou to find out
who the owner of the valis could be conjectur from the sonnet and
letter from the monei in gold and from the fine of the shirt
that he must be some lover of distinct whom the scorn and cruelti of
hi ladi had driven to some desper cours but as in that
uninhabit and rug spot there wa no on to be seen of whom he
could inquir he saw noth els for it but to push on take
whatev road rocinant chosewhich wa where he could make hi
wayfirmli persuad that among these wild he could not fail to meet
some rare adventur as he went along then occupi with these
thought he perceiv on the summit of a height that rose befor their
ey a man who went spring from rock to rock and from tussock to
tussock with marvel agil as well as he could make out he wa
unclad with a thick black beard long tangl hair and bare leg and

he wa barehead and notwithstand the swift with which he
pass as ha been describ the knight of the rueful counten
observ and note all these trifl and though he made the attempt
he wa unabl to follow him for it wa not grant to the feebl
of rocinant to make wai over such rough ground he be moreov
slowpac and sluggish by natur don quixot at onc came to the
conclus that thi wa the owner of the saddlepad and of the valis
and made up hi mind to go in search of him even though he should have
to wander a year in those mountain befor he found him and so he
direct sancho to take a short cut over on side of the mountain
while he himself went by the other and perhap by thi mean thei
might light upon thi man who had pass so quickli out of their sight
i could not do that said sancho for when i separ from your
worship fear at onc lai hold of me and assail me with all sort of
panic and fanci and let what i now sai be a notic that from thi
time forth i am not go to stir a finger width from your presenc
it shall be so said he of the rueful counten and i am veri
glad that thou art will to reli on my courag which will never fail
thee even though the soul in thy bodi fail thee so come on now behind
me slowli as well as thou canst and make lantern of thine ey let
us make the circuit of thi ridg perhap we shall light upon thi man
that we saw who no doubt is no other than the owner of what we found
to which sancho made answer far better would it be not to look for
him for if we find him and he happen to be the owner of the monei
it is plain i must restor it it would be better therefor that
without take thi needless troubl i should keep possess of it
until in some other less meddlesom and offici wai the real owner
mai be discov and perhap that will be when i shall have spent it
and then the king will hold me harmless
thou art wrong there sancho said don quixot for now that we have
a suspicion who the owner is and have him almost befor us we ar
bound to seek him and make restitut and if we do not see him the
strong suspicion we have as to hi be the owner make us as guilti
as if he were so and so friend sancho let not our search for him
give thee ani uneasi for if we find him it will reliev mine
and so sai he gave rocinant the spur and sancho follow him on
foot and load and after have partli made the circuit of the
mountain thei found ly in a ravin dead and half devour by dog
and peck by jackdaw a mule saddl and bridl all which still
further strengthen their suspicion that he who had fled wa the owner

never trodden except by the feet of goat or of the wolv and other
wild beast that roam around sancho in return bade him come down
and thei would explain all to him
the goatherd descend and reach the place where don quixot stood
he said i will wager you ar look at that hack mule that li dead
in the hollow there and faith it ha been ly there now these six
month tell me have you come upon it master about here
we have come upon nobodi answer don quixot nor on anyth

near it for fear of some illluck or be charg with theft for the
devil is crafti and thing rise up under on feet to make on fall
without know why or wherefor

not go within a stone throw of it there i left it and there it li
just as it wa for i dont want a dog with a bell

that same mule which li dead here and with the same saddlepad and
valis which you sai you found and did not touch he ask us what part
of thi sierra wa the most rug and retir we told him that it wa
where we now ar and so in truth it is for if you push on half a
leagu farther perhap you will not be abl to find your wai out and
i am wonder how you have manag to come here for there is no road
or path that lead to thi spot i sai then that on hear our
answer the youth turn about and made for the place we point out to
him leav us all charm with hi good look and wonder at hi
question and the hast with which we saw him depart in the direct of
the sierra and after that we saw him no more until some dai
afterward he cross the path of on of our shepherd and without
sai a word to him came up to him and gave him sever cuff and
kick and then turn to the ass with our provis and took all the
bread and chees it carri and have done thi made off back again
into the sierra with extraordinari swift when some of us goatherd
learn thi we went in search of him for about two dai through the
most remot portion of thi sierra at the end of which we found him
lodg in the hollow of a larg thick cork tree he came out to meet us
with great gentl with hi dress now torn and hi face so
disfigur and burn by the sun that we hardli recognis him but
that hi cloth though torn convinc us from the recollect we
had of them that he wa the person we were look for he salut us
courteous and in a few wellspoken word he told us not to wonder at
see him go about in thi guis as it wa bind upon him in
order that he might work out a penanc which for hi mani sin had been
impos upon him we ask him to tell us who he wa but we were never
abl to find out from him we beg of him too when he wa in want of
food which he could not do without to tell us where we should find
him as we would bring it to him with all goodwil and readi or
if thi were not to hi tast at least to come and ask it of us and
not take it by forc from the shepherd he thank us for the offer
beg pardon for the late assault and promis for the futur to ask
it in god name without offer violenc to anybodi as for fix
abod he said he had no other than that which chanc offer wherev
night might overtak him and hi word end in an outburst of weep
so bitter that we who listen to him must have been veri stone had we
not join him in it compar what we saw of him the first time with
what we saw now for as i said he wa a grace and graciou youth
and in hi courteou and polish languag show himself to be of good
birth and courtli breed and rustic as we were that listen to
him even to our rustic hi gentl bear suffic to make it
plain
but in the midst of hi convers he stop and becam silent
keep hi ey fix upon the ground for some time dure which we
stood still wait anxious to see what would come of thi
abstract and with no littl piti for from hi behaviour now
stare at the ground with fix gaze and ey wide open without move
an eyelid again close them compress hi lip and rais hi
eyebrow we could perceiv plainli that a fit of mad of some kind
had come upon him and befor long he show that what we imagin wa
the truth for he aros in a furi from the ground where he had thrown
himself and attack the first he found near him with such rage and
fierc that if we had not drag him off him he would have beaten
or bitten him to death all the while exclaim oh faithless
fernando here here shalt thou pai the penalti of the wrong thou hast
done me these hand shall tear out that heart of thine abod and
dwell of all iniqu but of deceit and fraud abov all and to
these he ad other word all in effect upbraid thi fernando and
charg him with treacheri and faithless
we forc him to releas hi hold with no littl difficulti and
without anoth word he left us and rush off plung in among these
brake and brambl so as to make it imposs for us to follow him
from thi we suppos that mad come upon him from time to time and
that someon call fernando must have done him a wrong of a grievou
natur such as the condit to which it had brought him seem to
show all thi ha been sinc then confirm on those occas and
thei have been mani on which he ha cross our path at on time to
beg the shepherd to give him some of the food thei carri at anoth
to take it from them by forc for when there is a fit of mad upon
him even though the shepherd offer it freeli he will not accept it
but snatch it from them by dint of blow but when he is in hi
sens he beg it for the love of god courteous and civilli and
receiv it with mani thank and not a few tear and to tell you the
truth sir continu the goatherd it wa yesterdai that we

assur he began as follow
my name is cardenio my birthplac on of the best citi of thi
andalusia my famili nobl my parent rich my misfortun so great
that my parent must have wept and my famili griev over it without
be abl by their wealth to lighten it for the gift of fortun can
do littl to reliev revers sent by heaven in that same countri
there wa a heaven in which love had place all the glori i could
desir such wa the beauti of luscinda a damsel as nobl and as rich
as i but of happier fortun and of less firm than wa due to so
worthi a passion as mine thi luscinda i love worship and ador
from my earliest and tenderest year and she love me in all the
innoc and sincer of childhood our parent were awar of our
feel and were not sorri to perceiv them for thei saw clearli
that as thei ripen thei must lead at last to a marriag between us a
thing that seem almost prearrang by the equal of our famili
and wealth we grew up and with our growth grew the love between us
so that the father of luscinda felt bound for proprieti sake to
refus me admiss to hi hous in thi perhap imit the parent
of that thisb so celebr by the poet and thi refus but ad
love to love and flame to flame for though thei enforc silenc upon
our tongu thei could not impos it upon our pen which can make
known the heart secret to a love on more freeli than tongu for
mani a time the presenc of the object of love shake the firmest will
and strike dumb the boldest tongu ah heaven how mani letter did i
write her and how mani dainti modest repli did i receiv how mani
ditti and lovesong did i compos in which my heart declar and
made known it feel describ it ardent long revel in it
recollect and dalli with it desir at length grow impati
and feel my heart languish with long to see her i resolv to
put into execut and carri out what seem to me the best mode of
win my desir and merit reward to ask her of her father for my
law wife which i did to thi hi answer wa that he thank me for
the disposit i show to do honour to him and to regard myself as
honour by the bestow of hi treasur but that as my father wa
aliv it wa hi by right to make thi demand for if it were not in
accord with hi full will and pleasur luscinda wa not to be
taken or given by stealth i thank him for hi kind reflect
that there wa reason in what he said and that my father would assent
to it as soon as i should tell him and with that view i went the veri
same instant to let him know what my desir were when i enter the
room where he wa i found him with an open letter in hi hand which
befor i could utter a word he gave me sai by thi letter thou
wilt see cardenio the disposit the duke ricardo ha to serv
thee thi duke ricardo as you sir probabl know alreadi is a
grande of spain who ha hi seat in the best part of thi andalusia i
took and read the letter which wa couch in term so flatter that
even i myself felt it would be wrong in my father not to compli with
the request the duke made in it which wa that he would send me
immedi to him as he wish me to becom the companion not
servant of hi eldest son and would take upon himself the charg of
place me in a posit correspond to the esteem in which he held
me on read the letter my voic fail me and still more when i
heard my father sai two dai henc thou wilt depart cardenio in
accord with the duke wish and give thank to god who is open
a road to thee by which thou mayest attain what i know thou dost
deserv and to these word he ad other of fatherli counsel the
time for my departur arriv i spoke on night to luscinda i told
her all that had occur as i did also to her father entreat him
to allow some delai and to defer the dispos of her hand until i
should see what the duke ricardo sought of me he gave me the promis
and she confirm it with vow and swoon unnumb final i
present myself to the duke and wa receiv and treat by him so
kindli that veri soon envi began to do it work the old servant
grow enviou of me and regard the duke inclin to show me
favour as an injuri to themselv but the on to whom my arriv gave
the greatest pleasur wa the duke second son fernando by name a
gallant youth of nobl gener and amor disposit who veri
soon made so intim a friend of me that it wa remark by everybodi
for though the elder wa attach to me and show me kind he did
not carri hi affection treatment to the same length as don
fernando it so happen then that as between friend no secret
remain unshar and as the favour i enjoi with don fernando had
grown into friendship he made all hi thought known to me and in
particular a love affair which troubl hi mind a littl he wa
deepli in love with a peasant girl a vassal of hi father the
daughter of wealthi parent and herself so beauti modest
discreet and virtuou that no on who knew her wa abl to decid in
which of these respect she wa most highli gift or most excel
the attract of the fair peasant rais the passion of don fernando
to such a point that in order to gain hi object and overcom her
virtuou resolut he determin to pledg hi word to her to becom
her husband for to attempt it in ani other wai wa to attempt an
imposs bound to him as i wa by friendship i strove by the
best argument and the most forcibl exampl i could think of to
restrain and dissuad him from such a cours but perceiv i produc
no effect i resolv to make the duke ricardo hi father acquaint
with the matter but don fernando be sharpwit and shrewd
foresaw and apprehend thi perceiv that by my duti as a good
servant i wa bound not to keep conceal a thing so much oppos to
the honour of my lord the duke and so to mislead and deceiv me he
told me he could find no better wai of effac from hi mind the
beauti that so enslav him than by absent himself for some month
and that he wish the absenc to be effect by our go both of us
to my father hous under the pretenc which he would make to the
duke of go to see and bui some fine hors that there were in my
citi which produc the best in the world when i heard him sai so
even if hi resolut had not been so good a on i should have hail
it as on of the happiest that could be imagin prompt by my
affect see what a favour chanc and opportun it offer
me of return to see my luscinda with thi thought and wish i
commend hi idea and encourag hi design advis him to put it
into execut as quickli as possibl as in truth absenc produc
it effect in spite of the most deepli root feel but as
afterward appear when he said thi to me he had alreadi enjoi the
peasant girl under the titl of husband and wa wait for an
opportun of make it known with safeti to himself be in dread
of what hi father the duke would do when he came to know of hi folli
it happen then that as with young men love is for the most part
noth more than appetit which as it final object is enjoy
come to an end on obtain it and that which seem to be love take
to flight as it cannot pass the limit fix by natur which fix no
limit to true lovewhat i mean is that after don fernando had enjoi
thi peasant girl hi passion subsid and hi eager cool and if
at first he feign a wish to absent himself in order to cure hi love
he wa now in realiti anxiou to go to avoid keep hi promis
the duke gave him permiss and order me to accompani him we
arriv at my citi and my father gave him the recept due to hi
rank i saw luscinda without delai and though it had not been dead or
deaden my love gather fresh life to my sorrow i told the stori of
it to don fernando for i thought that in virtu of the great
friendship he bore me i wa bound to conceal noth from him i
extol her beauti her gaieti her wit so warmli that my prais
excit in him a desir to see a damsel adorn by such attract to
my misfortun i yield to it show her to him on night by the
light of a taper at a window where we us to talk to on anoth as
she appear to him in her dressinggown she drove all the beauti he
had seen until then out of hi recollect speech fail him hi
head turn he wa spellbound and in the end lovesmitten as you
will see in the cours of the stori of my misfortun and to inflam
still further hi passion which he hid from me and reveal to heaven
alon it so happen that on dai he found a note of her entreat
me to demand her of her father in marriag so delic so modest and
so tender that on read it he told me that in luscinda alon were
combin all the charm of beauti and understand that were
distribut among all the other women in the world it is true and i
own it now that though i knew what good caus don fernando had to
prais luscinda it gave me uneasi to hear these prais from hi
mouth and i began to fear and with reason to feel distrust of him
for there wa no moment when he wa not readi to talk of luscinda and
he would start the subject himself even though he drag it in
unseason a circumst that arous in me a certain amount of
jealousi not that i fear ani chang in the constanc or faith of
luscinda but still my fate led me to forebod what she assur me
against don fernando contriv alwai to read the letter i sent to
luscinda and her answer to me under the pretenc that he enjoi the
wit and sens of both it so happen then that luscinda have
beg of me a book of chivalri to read on that she wa veri fond of
amadi of gaul
don quixot no sooner heard a book of chivalri mention than he said
had your worship told me at the begin of your stori that the ladi
luscinda wa fond of book of chivalri no other laudat would have
been requisit to impress upon me the superior of her understand
for it could not have been of the excel you describ had a tast
for such delight read been want so as far as i am concern
you need wast no more word in describ her beauti worth and
intellig for on mere hear what her tast wa i declar her
to be the most beauti and the most intellig woman in the world
and i wish your worship had along with amadi of gaul sent her the
worthi don rugel of greec for i know the ladi luscinda would greatli
relish daraida and garaya and the shrewd sai of the shepherd
darinel and the admir vers of hi bucol sung and deliv
by him with such sprightli wit and eas but a time mai come when
thi omiss can be remedi and to rectifi it noth more is need
than for your worship to be so good as to come with me to my villag
for there i can give you more than three hundr book which ar the
delight of my soul and the entertain of my lifethough it occur
to me that i have not got on of them now thank to the spite of
wick and enviou enchantersbut pardon me for have broken the
promis we made not to interrupt your discours for when i hear
chivalri or knightserr mention i can no more help talk about
them than the rai of the sun can help give heat or those of the
moon moistur pardon me therefor and proce for that is more to
the purpos now
while don quixot wa sai thi cardenio allow hi head to fall
upon hi breast and seem plung in deep thought and though twice
don quixot bade him go on with hi stori he neither look up nor
utter a word in repli but after some time he rais hi head and
said i cannot get rid of the idea nor will anyon in the world
remov it or make me think otherwiseand he would be a blockhead who
would hold or believ anyth els than that that arrant knave master
elisabad made free with queen madasima
that is not true by all that good said don quixot in high wrath
turn upon him angrili as hi wai wa and it is a veri great
slander or rather villaini queen madasima wa a veri illustri
ladi and it is not to be suppos that so exalt a princess would
have made free with a quack and whoever maintain the contrari li
like a great scoundrel and i will give him to know it on foot or on
horseback arm or unarm by night or by dai or as he like best
cardenio wa look at him steadili and hi mad fit have now come
upon him he had no disposit to go on with hi stori nor would don
quixot have listen to it so much had what he had heard about
madasima disgust him strang to sai he stood up for her as if she
were in earnest hi verit born ladi to such a pass had hi unholi
book brought him cardenio then be as i said now mad when he
heard himself given the lie and call a scoundrel and other insult
name not relish the jest snatch up a stone that he found near
him and with it deliv such a blow on don quixot breast that he
laid him on hi back sancho panza see hi master treat in thi
fashion attack the madman with hi close fist but the rag on
receiv him in such a wai that with a blow of hi fist he stretch
him at hi feet and then mount upon him crush hi rib to hi own
satisfact the goatherd who came to the rescu share the same
fate and have beaten and pummel them all he left them and quietli
withdrew to hi hidingplac on the mountain sancho rose and with the
rage he felt at find himself so belabour without deserv it ran
to take vengeanc on the goatherd accus him of not give them
warn that thi man wa at time taken with a mad fit for if thei
had known it thei would have been on their guard to protect themselv
the goatherd repli that he had said so and that if he had not heard
him that wa no fault of hi sancho retort and the goatherd
rejoin and the alterc end in their seiz each other by the
beard and exchang such fisticuff that if don quixot had not made
peac between them thei would have knock on anoth to piec
leav me alon sir knight of the rueful counten said sancho
grappl with the goatherd for of thi fellow who is a clown like
myself and no dub knight i can safe take satisfact for the
affront he ha offer me fight with him hand to hand like an
honest man
that is true said don quixot but i know that he is not to blame
for what ha happen
with thi he pacifi them and again ask the goatherd if it would be
possibl to find cardenio as he felt the greatest anxieti to know the
end of hi stori the goatherd told him as he had told him befor
that there wa no know of a certainti where hi lair wa but that
if he wander about much in that neighbourhood he could not fail to
fall in with him either in or out of hi sens

don quixot took leav of the goatherd and onc more mount
rocinant bade sancho follow him which he have no ass did veri
discontentedli thei proceed slowli make their wai into the most
rug part of the mountain sancho all the while dy to have a talk
with hi master and long for him to begin so that there should be
no breach of the injunct laid upon him but unabl to keep silenc
so long he said to him
seor don quixot give me your worship bless and dismiss for
id like to go home at onc to my wife and children with whom i can at
ani rate talk and convers as much as i like for to want me to go
through these solitud dai and night and not speak to you when i have
a mind is buri me aliv if luck would have it that anim spoke as
thei did in the dai of guisopet it would not be so bad becaus i
could talk to rocinant about whatev came into my head and so put up
with my illfortun but it is a hard case and not to be born with
patienc to go seek adventur all on life and get noth but
kick and blanket brickbat and punch and with all thi to have
to sew up on mouth without dare to sai what is in on heart
just as if on were dumb
i understand thee sancho repli don quixot thou art dy to
have the interdict i place upon thy tongu remov consid it
remov and sai what thou wilt while we ar wander in these
mountain
so be it said sancho let me speak now for god know what will
happen byandbi and to take advantag of the permit at onc i ask
what made your worship stand up so for that queen majimasa or whatev
her name is or what did it matter whether that abbot wa a friend of
her or not for if your worship had let that passand you were not a
judg in the matterit is my belief the madman would have gone on with
hi stori and the blow of the stone and the kick and more than half
a dozen cuff would have been escap
in faith sancho answer don quixot if thou knewest as i do what
an honour and illustri ladi queen madasima wa i know thou
wouldst sai i had great patienc that i did not break in piec the
mouth that utter such blasphemi for a veri great blasphemi it is
to sai or imagin that a queen ha made free with a surgeon the truth
of the stori is that that master elisabad whom the madman mention wa
a man of great prudenc and sound judgment and serv as governor and
physician to the queen but to suppos that she wa hi mistress is
nonsens deserv veri sever punish and as a proof that cardenio
did not know what he wa sai rememb when he said it he wa out of
hi wit
that is what i sai said sancho there wa no occas for mind
the word of a madman for if good luck had not help your worship
and he had sent that stone at your head instead of at your breast a
fine wai we should have been in for stand up for my ladi yonder god
confound her and then would not cardenio have gone free as a madman
against men in their sens or against madmen said don quixot
everi knighterr is bound to stand up for the honour of women
whoever thei mai be much more for queen of such high degre and
digniti as queen madasima for whom i have a particular regard on
account of her amiabl qualiti for besid be extrem
beauti she wa veri wise and veri patient under her misfortun
of which she had mani and the counsel and societi of the master
elisabad were a great help and support to her in endur her
afflict with wisdom and resign henc the ignor and
illdispos vulgar took occas to sai and think that she wa hi
mistress and thei lie i sai it onc more and will lie two hundr
time more all who think and sai so
i neither sai nor think so said sancho let them look to it with
their bread let them eat it thei have render account to god whether
thei misbehav or not i come from my vineyard i know noth i am
not fond of pry into other men live he who bui and li feel
it in hi purs moreov nake wa i born nake i find myself i
neither lose nor gain but if thei did what is that to me mani think
there ar flitch where there ar no hook but who can put gate to
the open plain moreov thei said of god
god bless me said don quixot what a set of absurd thou art
string togeth what ha what we ar talk about got to do with
the proverb thou art thread on after the other for god sake
hold thy tongu sancho and henceforward keep to prod thy ass and
dont meddl in what doe not concern thee and understand with all thy
five sens that everyth i have done am do or shall do is well
found on reason and in conform with the rule of chivalri for i
understand them better than all the world that profess them

peac i sai again sancho said don quixot for let me tell thee
it is not so much the desir of find that madman that lead me into
these region as that which i have of perform among them an
achiev wherewith i shall win etern name and fame throughout the
known world and it shall be such that i shall therebi set the seal on
all that can make a knighterr perfect and famou
and is it veri peril thi achiev
no repli he of the rueful counten though it mai be in the
dice that we mai throw deuceac instead of six but all will depend
on thy dilig
on my dilig said sancho
ye said don quixot for if thou dost return soon from the place
where i mean to send thee my penanc will be soon over and my glori
will soon begin but as it is not right to keep thee ani longer in
suspens wait to see what come of my word i would have thee
know sancho that the famou amadi of gaul wa on of the most
perfect knightserranti am wrong to sai he wa on he stood alon
the first the onli on the lord of all that were in the world in hi
time a fig for don beliani and for all who sai he equal him in
ani respect for my oath upon it thei ar deceiv themselv i
sai too that when a painter desir to becom famou in hi art he
endeavour to copi the origin of the rarest painter that he know
and the same rule hold good for all the most import craft and
call that serv to adorn a state thu must he who would be
esteem prudent and patient imit ulyss in whose person and
labour homer present to us a live pictur of prudenc and patienc
as virgil too show us in the person of nea the virtu of a piou
son and the sagac of a brave and skil captain not repres
or describ them as thei were but as thei ought to be so as to
leav the exampl of their virtu to poster in the same wai amadi
wa the polestar daystar sun of valiant and devot knight whom
all we who fight under the banner of love and chivalri ar bound to
imit thi then be so i consid friend sancho that the
knighterr who shall imit him most close will come nearest to
reach the perfect of chivalri now on of the instanc in which
thi knight most conspicu show hi prudenc worth valour
endur fortitud and love wa when he withdrew reject by the
ladi oriana to do penanc upon the pea pobr chang hi name into
that of beltenebro a name assuredli signific and appropri to
the life which he had voluntarili adopt so as it is easier for me
to imit him in thi than in cleav giant asund cut off
serpent head slai dragon rout armi destroi fleet
and break enchant and as thi place is so well suit for a
similar purpos i must not allow the opportun to escap which now
so conveni offer me it forelock
what is it in realiti said sancho that your worship mean to do in
such an outofthewai place as thi
have i not told thee answer don quixot that i mean to imit
amadi here plai the victim of despair the madman the maniac so
as at the same time to imit the valiant don roland when at the
fountain he had evid of the fair angelica have disgrac herself
with medoro and through grief thereat went mad and pluck up tree
troubl the water of the clear spring slew shepherd destroi
flock burn down hut level hous drag mare after him and
perpetr a hundr thousand other outrag worthi of everlast
renown and record and though i have no intent of imit roland
or orlando or rotolando for he went by all these name step by step
in all the mad thing he did said and thought i will make a rough
copi to the best of my power of all that seem to me most essenti
but perhap i shall content myself with the simpl imit of amadi
who without give wai to ani mischiev mad but mere to tear
and sorrow gain as much fame as the most famou
it seem to me said sancho that the knight who behav in thi
wai had provoc and caus for those folli and penanc but what
caus ha your worship for go mad what ladi ha reject you or
what evid have you found to prove that the ladi dulcinea del toboso
ha been trifl with moor or christian
there is the point repli don quixot and that is the beauti of
thi busi of mine no thank to a knighterr for go mad when
he ha caus the thing is to turn crazi without ani provoc and
let my ladi know if i do thi in the dry what i would do in the
moist moreov i have abund caus in the long separ i have
endur from my ladi till death dulcinea del toboso for as thou didst
hear that shepherd ambrosio sai the other dai in absenc all ill ar
felt and fear and so friend sancho wast no time in advis me
against so rare so happi and so unheardof an imit mad i am
and mad i must be until thou returnest with the answer to a letter that
i mean to send by thee to my ladi dulcinea and if it be such as my
constanc deserv my insan and penanc will come to an end and if
it be to the opposit effect i shall becom mad in earnest and be
so i shall suffer no more thu in whatev wai she mai answer i shall
escap from the struggl and afflict in which thou wilt leav me
enjoi in my sens the boon thou bearest me or as a madman not
feel the evil thou bringest me but tell me sancho hast thou got
mambrino helmet safe for i saw thee take it up from the ground when
that ungrat wretch tri to break it in piec but could not by
which the fine of it temper mai be seen
to which sancho made answer by the live god sir knight of the
rueful counten i cannot endur or bear with patienc some of the
thing that your worship sai and from them i begin to suspect that
all you tell me about chivalri and win kingdom and empir and
give island and bestow other reward and digniti after the
custom of knightserr must be all made up of wind and li and all
pigment or figment or whatev we mai call them for what would
anyon think that heard your worship call a barber basin
mambrino helmet without ever see the mistak all thi time but
that on who sai and maintain such thing must have hi brain
addl i have the basin in my sack all dint and i am take it home
to have it mend to trim my beard in it if by god grace i am
allow to see my wife and children some dai or other
look here sancho said don quixot by him thou didst swear by just
now i swear thou hast the most limit understand that ani squir in
the world ha or ever had is it possibl that all thi time thou hast
been go about with me thou hast never found out that all thing
belong to knightserr seem to be illus and nonsens and
rave and to go alwai by contrari and not becaus it realli is
so but becaus there is alwai a swarm of enchant in attend
upon us that chang and alter everyth with us and turn thing as
thei pleas and accord as thei ar dispos to aid or destroi us
thu what seem to thee a barber basin seem to me mambrino helmet
and to anoth it will seem someth els and rare foresight it wa
in the sage who is on my side to make what is realli and truli
mambrino helmet seem a basin to everybodi for be held in such
estim as it is all the world would pursu me to rob me of it but
when thei see it is onli a barber basin thei do not take the troubl
to obtain it as wa plainli shown by him who tri to break it and
left it on the ground without take it for by my faith had he known
it he would never have left it behind keep it safe my friend for
just now i have no need of it inde i shall have to take off all
thi armour and remain as nake as i wa born if i have a mind to
follow roland rather than amadi in my penanc
thu talk thei reach the foot of a high mountain which stood like
an isol peak among the other that surround it past it base
there flow a gentl brook all around it spread a meadow so green and
luxuri that it wa a delight to the ey to look upon it and forest
tree in abund and shrub and flower ad to the charm of the
spot upon thi place the knight of the rueful counten fix hi
choic for the perform of hi penanc and as he beheld it
exclaim in a loud voic as though he were out of hi sens
thi is the place oh ye heaven that i select and choos for
bewail the misfortun in which ye yourselv have plung me thi
is the spot where the overflow of mine ey shall swell the water
of yon littl brook and my deep and endless sigh shall stir
unceasingli the leav of these mountain tree in testimoni and token
of the pain my persecut heart is suffer oh ye rural deiti
whoever ye be that haunt thi lone spot give ear to the complaint of a
wretch lover whom long absenc and brood jealousi have driven to
bewail hi fate among these wild and complain of the hard heart of
that fair and ungrat on the end and limit of all human beauti
oh ye wood nymph and dryad that dwell in the thicket of the
forest so mai the nimbl wanton satyr by whom ye ar vainli woo
never disturb your sweet repos help me to lament my hard fate or at
least weari not at listen to it oh dulcinea del toboso dai of my
night glori of my pain guid of my path star of my fortun so mai
heaven grant thee in full all thou seekest of it bethink thee of the
place and condit to which absenc from thee ha brought me and make
that return in kind that is due to my fidel oh lone tree
that from thi dai forward shall bear me compani in my solitud give
me some sign by the gentl movement of your bough that my presenc is
not distast to you oh thou my squir pleasant companion in my
prosper and advers fortun fix well in thy memori what thou shalt
see me do here so that thou mayest relat and report it to the sole
caus of all and so sai he dismount from rocinant and in an
instant reliev him of saddl and bridl and give him a slap on the
croup said he give thee freedom who is bereft of it himself oh
steed as excel in deed as thou art unfortun in thy lot begon
where thou wilt for thou bearest written on thy forehead that neither
astolfo hippogriff nor the fame frontino that cost bradamant so
dear could equal thee in speed
see thi sancho said good luck to him who ha save us the troubl
of strip the packsaddl off dappl by my faith he would not have
gone without a slap on the croup and someth said in hi prais
though if he were here i would not let anyon strip him for there
would be no occas as he had noth of the lover or victim of
despair about him inasmuch as hi master which i wa while it wa
god pleasur wa noth of the sort and inde sir knight of the
rueful counten if my departur and your worship mad ar to
come off in earnest it will be as well to saddl rocinant again in
order that he mai suppli the want of dappl becaus it will save me
time in go and return for if i go on foot i dont know when i
shall get there or when i shall get back as i am in truth a bad
walker
i declar sancho return don quixot it shall be as thou wilt
for thy plan doe not seem to me a bad on and three dai henc thou
wilt depart for i wish thee to observ in the meantim what i do and
sai for her sake that thou mayest be abl to tell it
but what more have i to see besid what i have seen said sancho
much thou knowest about it said don quixot i have now got to tear
up my garment to scatter about my armour knock my head against these
rock and more of the same sort of thing which thou must wit
for the love of god said sancho be care your worship how you
give yourself those knock on the head for you mai come across such a
rock and in such a wai that the veri first mai put an end to the
whole contriv of thi penanc and i should think if inde knock
on the head seem necessari to you and thi busi cannot be done
without them you might be contenta the whole thing is feign and
counterfeit and in jokey might be content i sai with give them
to yourself in the water or against someth soft like cotton and
leav it all to me for ill tell my ladi that your worship knock
your head against a point of rock harder than a diamond
i thank thee for thy good intent friend sancho answer don
quixot but i would have thee know that all these thing i am do
ar not in joke but veri much in earnest for anyth els would be a
transgress of the ordin of chivalri which forbid us to tell
ani lie whatev under the penalti due to apostasi and to do on
thing instead of anoth is just the same as ly so my knock on the
head must be real solid and valid without anyth sophist or
fanci about them and it will be need to leav me some lint to
dress my wound sinc fortun ha compel us to do without the
balsam we lost
it wa wors lose the ass repli sancho for with him lint and
all were lost but i beg of your worship not to remind me again of that
accurs liquor for my soul not to sai my stomach turn at hear
the veri name of it and i beg of you too to reckon as past the three
dai you allow me for see the mad thing you do for i take them
as seen alreadi and pronounc upon and i will tell wonder stori
to my ladi so write the letter and send me off at onc for i long to
return and take your worship out of thi purgatori where i am leav
you
purgatori dost thou call it sancho said don quixot rather call
it hell or even wors if there be anyth wors
for on who is in hell said sancho nulla est retentio as i have
heard sai
i do not understand what retentio mean said don quixot
retentio answer sancho mean that whoever is in hell never
come nor can come out of it which will be the opposit case with your
worship or my leg will be idl that is if i have spur to enliven
rocinant let me onc get to el toboso and into the presenc of my
ladi dulcinea and i will tell her such thing of the folli and
mad for it is all on that your worship ha done and is still
do that i will manag to make her softer than a glove though i find
her harder than a cork tree and with her sweet and honei answer i
will come back through the air like a witch and take your worship out
of thi purgatori that seem to be hell but is not as there is hope of
get out of it which as i have said those in hell have not and i
believ your worship will not sai anyth to the contrari
that is true said he of the rueful counten but how shall we
manag to write the letter
and the asscolt order too ad sancho
all shall be includ said don quixot and as there is no paper
it would be well done to write it on the leav of tree as the
ancient did or on tablet of wax though that would be as hard to
find just now as paper but it ha just occur to me how it mai be
conveni and even more than conveni written and that is in
the notebook that belong to cardenio and thou wilt take care to have
it copi on paper in a good hand at the first villag thou comest to
where there is a schoolmast or if not ani sacristan will copi it
but see thou give it not to ani notari to copi for thei write a law
hand that satan could not make out
but what is to be done about the signatur said sancho
the letter of amadi were never sign said don quixot
that is all veri well said sancho but the order must need be
sign and if it is copi thei will sai the signatur is fals and i
shall be left without asscolt
the order shall go sign in the same book said don quixot and on
see it my niec will make no difficulti about obei it as to the
lovelett thou canst put by wai of signatur your till death the
knight of the rueful counten and it will be no great matter if
it is in some other person hand for as well as i recollect dulcinea
can neither read nor write nor in the whole cours of her life ha she
seen handwrit or letter of mine for my love and her have been
alwai platon not go beyond a modest look and even that so
seldom that i can safe swear i have not seen her four time in all
these twelv year i have been love her more than the light of these
ey that the earth will on dai devour and perhap even of those four
time she ha not onc perceiv that i wa look at her such is the
retir and seclus in which her father lorenzo corchuelo and her
mother aldonza nogal have brought her up
so so said sancho lorenzo corchuelo daughter is the ladi
dulcinea del toboso otherwis call aldonza lorenzo
she it is said don quixot and she it is that is worthi to be ladi
of the whole univers
i know her well said sancho and let me tell you she can fling a
crowbar as well as the lustiest lad in all the town giver of all good
but she is a brave lass and a right and stout on and fit to be
helpmat to ani knighterr that is or is to be who mai make her hi
ladi the whoreson wench what sting she ha and what a voic i can
tell you on dai she post herself on the top of the belfri of the
villag to call some labour of their that were in a plough field
of her father and though thei were better than half a leagu off
thei heard her as well as if thei were at the foot of the tower and
the best of her is that she is not a bit prudish for she ha plenti of
affabl and joke with everybodi and ha a grin and a jest for
everyth so sir knight of the rueful counten i sai you not
onli mai and ought to do mad freak for her sake but you have a good
right to give wai to despair and hang yourself and no on who know of
it but will sai you did well though the devil should take you and i
wish i were on my road alreadi simpli to see her for it is mani a dai
sinc i saw her and she must be alter by thi time for go about
the field alwai and the sun and the air spoil women look greatli
but i must own the truth to your worship seor don quixot until now
i have been under a great mistak for i believ truli and honestli
that the ladi dulcinea must be some princess your worship wa in love
with or some person great enough to deserv the rich present you have
sent her such as the biscayan and the gallei slave and mani more no
doubt for your worship must have won mani victori in the time when i
wa not yet your squir but all thing consid what good can it do
the ladi aldonza lorenzo i mean the ladi dulcinea del toboso to have
the vanquish your worship send or will send come to her and go
down on their knee befor her becaus mayb when thei came shed be
hackl flax or thresh on the thresh floor and theyd be
asham to see her and shed laugh or resent the present
i have befor now told thee mani time sancho said don quixot
that thou art a mighti great chatter and that with a blunt wit thou
art alwai strive at sharp but to show thee what a fool thou art
and how ration i am i would have thee listen to a short stori thou
must know that a certain widow fair young independ and rich and
abov all free and easi fell in love with a sturdi strap young
laybroth hi superior came to know of it and on dai said to the
worthi widow by wai of brotherli remonstr i am surpris seora
and not without good reason that a woman of such high stand so
fair and so rich as you ar should have fallen in love with such a
mean low stupid fellow as soandso when in thi hous there ar so
mani master graduat and divin student from among whom you
might choos as if thei were a lot of pear sai thi on ill
take that i wont take but she repli to him with great
sprightli and candour my dear sir you ar veri much mistaken
and your idea ar veri oldfashion if you think that i have made a
bad choic in soandso fool as he seem becaus for all i want with
him he know as much and more philosophi than aristotl in the same
wai sancho for all i want with dulcinea del toboso she is just as
good as the most exalt princess on earth it is not to be suppos
that all those poet who sang the prais of ladi under the fanci
name thei give them had ani such mistress thinkest thou that the
amarillis the phillis the sylvia the diana the galatea the
flida and all the rest of them that the book the ballad the
barber shop the theatr ar full of were realli and truli ladi
of flesh and blood and mistress of those that glorifi and have
glorifi them noth of the kind thei onli invent them for the most
part to furnish a subject for their vers and that thei mai pass for
lover or for men valiant enough to be so and so it suffic me to
think and believ that the good aldonza lorenzo is fair and virtuou
and as to her pedigre it is veri littl matter for no on will
examin into it for the purpos of confer ani order upon her and
i for my part reckon her the most exalt princess in the world for
thou shouldst know sancho if thou dost not know that two thing
alon beyond all other ar incent to love and these ar great
beauti and a good name and these two thing ar to be found in
dulcinea in the highest degre for in beauti no on equal her and in
good name few approach her and to put the whole thing in a nutshel i
persuad myself that all i sai is as i sai neither more nor less and
i pictur her in my imagin as i would have her to be as well in
beauti as in condit helen approach her not nor doe lucretia come
up to her nor ani other of the famou women of time past greek
barbarian or latin and let each sai what he will for if in thi i am
taken to task by the ignor i shall not be censur by the
critic
i sai that your worship is entir right said sancho and that i
am an ass but i know not how the name of ass came into my mouth for a
rope is not to be mention in the hous of him who ha been hang
but now for the letter and then god be with you i am off
don quixot took out the notebook and retir to on side veri
deliber began to write the letter and when he had finish it he
call to sancho sai he wish to read it to him so that he might
commit it to memori in case of lose it on the road for with evil
fortun like hi anyth might be apprehend to which sancho
repli write it two or three time there in the book and give it to
me and i will carri it veri carefulli becaus to expect me to keep it
in my memori is all nonsens for i have such a bad on that i often
forget my own name but for all that repeat it to me as i shall like
to hear it for sure it will run as if it wa in print
listen said don quixot thi is what it sai
don quixot letter to dulcinea del toboso
sovereign and exalt ladyth pierc by the point of absenc the
wound to the heart core send thee sweetest dulcinea del toboso
the health that he himself enjoi not if thy beauti despis me if
thy worth is not for me if thy scorn is my afflict though i be
suffici longsuff hardli shall i endur thi anxieti which
besid be oppress is protract my good squir sancho will
relat to thee in full fair ingrat dear enemi the condit to
which i am reduc on thy account if it be thy pleasur to give me
relief i am thine if not do as mai be pleas to thee for by
end my life i shall satisfi thy cruelti and my desir
thine till death
the knight of the rueful counten
by the life of my father said sancho when he heard the letter it
is the loftiest thing i ever heard bodi of me how your worship sai
everyth as you like in it and how well you fit in the knight of
the rueful counten into the signatur i declar your worship is
inde the veri devil and there is noth you dont know
everyth is need for the call i follow said don quixot
now then said sancho let your worship put the order for the three
asscolt on the other side and sign it veri plainli that thei mai
recognis it at first sight
with all my heart said don quixot and as he had written it he read
it to thi effect
mistress niecebi thi first of asscolt pleas pai to sancho panza
my squir three of the five i left at home in your charg said three
asscolt to be paid and deliv for the same number receiv here in
hand which upon thi and upon hi receipt shall be duli paid done in
the heart of the sierra morena the twentyseventh of august of thi
present year
that will do said sancho now let your worship sign it
there is no need to sign it said don quixot but mere to put my
flourish which is the same as a signatur and enough for three ass
or even three hundr
i can trust your worship return sancho let me go and saddl
rocinant and be readi to give me your bless for i mean to go at
onc without see the fooleri your worship is go to do ill sai
i saw you do so mani that she will not want ani more
at ani rate sancho said don quixot i should likeand there is
reason for iti should like thee i sai to see me strip to the skin
and perform a dozen or two of insan which i can get done in
less than half an hour for have seen them with thine own ey thou
canst then safe swear to the rest that thou wouldst add and i
promis thee thou wilt not tell of as mani as i mean to perform
for the love of god master mine said sancho let me not see your
worship strip for it will sore griev me and i shall not be abl
to keep from tear and my head ach so with all i shed last night for
dappl that i am not fit to begin ani fresh weep but if it is your
worship pleasur that i should see some insan do them in your
cloth short on and such as come readiest to hand for i myself
want noth of the sort and as i have said it will be a save of
time for my return which will be with the new your worship desir
and deserv if not let the ladi dulcinea look to it if she doe not
answer reason i swear as solemnli as i can that i will fetch a
fair answer out of her stomach with kick and cuff for why should it
be born that a knighterr as famou as your worship should go mad
without rhyme or reason for a her ladyship had best not drive me to
sai it for by god i will speak out and let off everyth cheap even
if it doesnt sell i am pretti good at that she littl know me
faith if she knew me shed be in aw of me
in faith sancho said don quixot to all appear thou art no
sounder in thy wit than i
i am not so mad answer sancho but i am more pepperi but apart
from all thi what ha your worship to eat until i come back will you
salli out on the road like cardenio to forc it from the shepherd
let not that anxieti troubl thee repli don quixot for even if
i had it i should not eat anyth but the herb and the fruit which
thi meadow and these tree mai yield me the beauti of thi busi
of mine li in not eat and in perform other mortif
do you know what i am afraid of said sancho upon thi that i shall
not be abl to find my wai back to thi spot where i am leav you it
is such an outofthewai place
observ the landmark well said don quixot for i will try not to
go far from thi neighbourhood and i will even take care to mount the
highest of these rock to see if i can discov thee return
howev not to miss me and lose thyself the best plan will be to cut
some branch of the broom that is so abund about here and as thou
goest to lai them at interv until thou hast come out upon the plain
these will serv thee after the fashion of the clue in the labyrinth
of theseu as mark and sign for find me on thy return
so i will said sancho panza and have cut some he ask hi
master bless and not without mani tear on both side took hi
leav of him and mount rocinant of whom don quixot charg him
earnestli to have as much care as of hi own person he set out for the
plain strew at interv the branch of broom as hi master had
recommend him and so he went hi wai though don quixot still
entreat him to see him do were it onli a coupl of mad act he had
not gone a hundr pace howev when he return and said
i must sai seor your worship said quit right that in order to be
abl to swear without a weight on my conscienc that i had seen you do
mad thing it would be well for me to see if it were onli on though
in your worship remain here i have seen a veri great on

did i not tell thee so said don quixot wait sancho and i will
do them in the sai of a credo and pull off hi breech in all
hast he strip himself to hi skin and hi shirt and then without
more ado he cut a coupl of gambado in the air and a coupl of
somersault heel over head make such a displai that not to see it
a second time sancho wheel rocinant round and felt easi and
satisfi in hi mind that he could swear he had left hi master mad

return to the proceed of him of the rueful counten when he
found himself alon the histori sai that when don quixot had
complet the perform of the somersault or caper nake from the
waist down and cloth from the waist up and saw that sancho had gone
off without wait to see ani more crazi feat he climb up to the
top of a high rock and there set himself to consid what he had
sever time befor consid without ever come to ani conclus
on the point name whether it would be better and more to hi purpos
to imit the outrag mad of roland or the melancholi mad
of amadi and commun with himself he said
what wonder is it if roland wa so good a knight and so valiant as
everyon sai he wa when after all he wa enchant and nobodi
could kill him save by thrust a cork pin into the sole of hi
foot and he alwai wore shoe with seven iron sole though cun
devic did not avail him against bernardo del carpio who knew all
about them and strangl him in hi arm at roncesval but put
the question of hi valour asid let us come to hi lose hi wit
for certain it is that he did lose them in consequ of the proof he
discov at the fountain and the intellig the shepherd gave him
of angelica have slept more than two siesta with medoro a littl
curlyhead moor and page to agramant if he wa persuad that thi
wa true and that hi ladi had wrong him it is no wonder that he
should have gone mad but i how am i to imit him in hi mad
unless i can imit him in the caus of it for my dulcinea i will
ventur to swear never saw a moor in her life as he is in hi proper
costum and she is thi dai as the mother that bore her and i should
plainli be do her a wrong if fanci anyth els i were to go
mad with the same kind of mad as roland the furiou on the other
hand i see that amadi of gaul without lose hi sens and without
do anyth mad acquir as a lover as much fame as the most
famou for accord to hi histori on find himself reject by
hi ladi oriana who had order him not to appear in her presenc
until it should be her pleasur all he did wa to retir to the pea
pobr in compani with a hermit and there he took hi fill of weep
until heaven sent him relief in the midst of hi great grief and need
and if thi be true as it is why should i now take the troubl to
strip stark nake or do mischief to these tree which have done me no
harm or why am i to disturb the clear water of these brook which
will give me to drink whenev i have a mind long live the memori of
amadi and let him be imit so far as is possibl by don quixot of
la mancha of whom it will be said as wa said of the other that if
he did not achiev great thing he di in attempt them and if i
am not repuls or reject by my dulcinea it is enough for me as i
have said to be absent from her and so now to busi come to my
memori ye deed of amadi and show me how i am to begin to imit
you i know alreadi that what he chiefli did wa to prai and commend
himself to god but what am i to do for a rosari for i have not got
on
and then it occur to him how he might make on and that wa by
tear a great strip off the tail of hi shirt which hung down and
make eleven knot on it on bigger than the rest and thi serv
him for a rosari all the time he wa there dure which he repeat
countless avemaria but what distress him greatli wa not have
anoth hermit there to confess him and receiv consol from and
so he solac himself with pace up and down the littl meadow and
write and carv on the bark of the tree and on the fine sand a
multitud of vers all in harmoni with hi sad and some in prais
of dulcinea but when he wa found there afterward the onli on
complet legibl that could be discov were those that follow

don quixot tear ar on the flow
and all for distant dulcinea
del toboso
the addit of del toboso to dulcinea name gave rise to no littl
laughter among those who found the abov line for thei suspect don
quixot must have fanci that unless he ad del toboso when he
introduc the name of dulcinea the vers would be unintellig
which wa inde the fact as he himself afterward admit he wrote
mani more but as ha been said these three vers were all that
could be plainli and perfectli deciph in thi wai and in sigh
and call on the faun and satyr of the wood and the nymph of the
stream and echo moist and mourn to answer consol and hear
him as well as in look for herb to sustain him he pass hi time
until sancho return and had that been delai three week as it wa
three dai the knight of the rueful counten would have worn such
an alter counten that the mother that bore him would not have
known him and here it will be well to leav him wrap up in sigh
and vers to relat how sancho panza fare on hi mission
as for him come out upon the high road he made for el toboso and
the next dai reach the inn where the mishap of the blanket had
befallen him as soon as he recognis it he felt as if he were onc
more live through the air and he could not bring himself to enter it
though it wa an hour when he might well have done so for it wa
dinnertim and he long to tast someth hot as it had been all
cold fare with him for mani dai past thi crave drove him to draw
near to the inn still undecid whether to go in or not and as he wa
hesit there came out two person who at onc recognis him and
said on to the other
seor licenti is not he on the hors there sancho panza who our
adventur housekeep told us went off with her master as esquir
so it is said the licenti and that is our friend don quixot
hors and if thei knew him so well it wa becaus thei were the
curat and the barber of hi own villag the same who had carri out
the scrutini and sentenc upon the book and as soon as thei
recognis sancho panza and rocinant be anxiou to hear of don
quixot thei approach and call him by hi name the curat said
friend sancho panza where is your master
sancho recognis them at onc and determin to keep secret the place
and circumst where and under which he had left hi master so he
repli that hi master wa engag in a certain quarter on a certain
matter of great import to him which he could not disclos for the
ey in hi head
nai nai said the barber if you dont tell us where he is sancho
panza we will suspect as we suspect alreadi that you have murder
and rob him for here you ar mount on hi hors in fact you
must produc the master of the hack or els take the consequ
there is no need of threat with me said sancho for i am not a man
to rob or murder anybodi let hi own fate or god who made him kill
each on my master is engag veri much to hi tast do penanc in
the midst of these mountain and then offhand and without stop
he told them how he had left him what adventur had befallen him and
how he wa carri a letter to the ladi dulcinea del toboso the
daughter of lorenzo corchuelo with whom he wa over head and ear in
love thei were both amaz at what sancho panza told them for though
thei were awar of don quixot mad and the natur of it each
time thei heard of it thei were fill with fresh wonder thei then
ask sancho panza to show them the letter he wa carri to the ladi
dulcinea del toboso he said it wa written in a notebook and that hi
master direct were that he should have it copi on paper at the
first villag he came to on thi the curat said if he show it to
him he himself would make a fair copi of it sancho put hi hand into
hi bosom in search of the notebook but could not find it nor if he
had been search until now could he have found it for don quixot
had kept it and had never given it to him nor had he himself thought
of ask for it when sancho discov he could not find the book hi
face grew deadli pale and in great hast he again felt hi bodi all
over and see plainli it wa not to be found without more ado he
seiz hi beard with both hand and pluck awai half of it and then
as quick as he could and without stop gave himself half a dozen
cuff on the face and nose till thei were bath in blood
see thi the curat and the barber ask him what had happen him
that he gave himself such rough treatment
what should happen to me repli sancho but to have lost from on
hand to the other in a moment three asscolt each of them like a
castl
how is that said the barber
i have lost the notebook said sancho that contain the letter to
dulcinea and an order sign by my master in which he direct hi
niec to give me three asscolt out of four or five he had at home
and he then told them about the loss of dappl
the curat consol him tell him that when hi master wa found he
would get him to renew the order and make a fresh draft on paper as
wa usual and customari for those made in notebook were never
accept or honour
sancho comfort himself with thi and said if that were so the loss
of dulcinea letter did not troubl him much for he had it almost by
heart and it could be taken down from him wherev and whenev thei
like
repeat it then sancho said the barber and we will write it down
afterward
sancho panza stop to scratch hi head to bring back the letter to
hi memori and balanc himself now on on foot now the other on
moment stare at the ground the next at the sky and after have
half gnaw off the end of a finger and kept them in suspens wait
for him to begin he said after a long paus by god seor
licenti devil a thing can i recollect of the letter but it said at
the begin exalt and scrub ladi
it cannot have said scrub said the barber but superhuman
or sovereign
that is it said sancho then as well as i rememb it went on
the wound and want of sleep and the pierc kiss your
worship hand ungrat and veri unrecognis fair on and it said
someth or other about health and sick that he wa send her
and from that it went tail off until it end with your till
death the knight of the rueful counten
it gave them no littl amus both of them to see what a good
memori sancho had and thei compliment him greatli upon it and
beg him to repeat the letter a coupl of time more so that thei
too might get it by heart to write it out byandbi sancho repeat it
three time and as he did utter three thousand more absurd
then he told them more about hi master but he never said a word about
the blanket that had befallen himself in that inn into which he
refus to enter he told them moreov how hi lord if he brought
him a favour answer from the ladi dulcinea del toboso wa to put
himself in the wai of endeavour to becom an emperor or at least a
monarch for it had been so settl between them and with hi person
worth and the might of hi arm it wa an easi matter to come to be on
and how on becom on hi lord wa to make a marriag for him for he
would be a widow by that time as a matter of cours and wa to give
him as a wife on of the damsel of the empress the heiress of some
rich and grand state on the mainland have noth to do with island
of ani sort for he did not care for them now all thi sancho
deliv with so much composurewip hi nose from time to timeand
with so littl commonsens that hi two hearer were again fill with
wonder at the forc of don quixot mad that could run awai with
thi poor man reason thei did not care to take the troubl of
disabus him of hi error as thei consid that sinc it did not
in ani wai hurt hi conscienc it would be better to leav him in it
and thei would have all the more amus in listen to hi
simplic and so thei bade him prai to god for hi lord health
as it wa a veri like and a veri feasibl thing for him in cours of
time to come to be an emperor as he said or at least an archbishop or
some other dignitari of equal rank
to which sancho made answer if fortun sir should bring thing
about in such a wai that my master should have a mind instead of be
an emperor to be an archbishop i should like to know what
archbishopserr commonli give their squir
thei commonli give them said the curat some simpl benefic or
cure or some place as sacristan which bring them a good fix incom
not count the altar fee which mai be reckon at as much more
but for that said sancho the squir must be unmarri and must
know at ani rate how to help at mass and if that be so woe is me
for i am marri alreadi and i dont know the first letter of the a b
c what will becom of me if my master take a fanci to be an
archbishop and not an emperor as is usual and customari with
knightserr
be not uneasi friend sancho said the barber for we will entreat
your master and advis him even urg it upon him as a case of
conscienc to becom an emperor and not an archbishop becaus it will
be easier for him as he is more valiant than letter
so i have thought said sancho though i can tell you he is fit for
anyth what i mean to do for my part is to prai to our lord to place
him where it mai be best for him and where he mai be abl to bestow
most favour upon me
you speak like a man of sens said the curat and you will be
act like a good christian but what must now be done is to take
step to coax your master out of that useless penanc you sai he is
perform and we had best turn into thi inn to consid what plan to
adopt and also to dine for it is now time
sancho said thei might go in but that he would wait there outsid and
that he would tell them afterward the reason why he wa unwil and
why it did not suit him to enter it but he beg them to bring him
out someth to eat and to let it be hot and also to bring barlei
for rocinant thei left him and went in and present the barber
brought him out someth to eat byandbi after thei had between
them carefulli thought over what thei should do to carri out their
object the curat hit upon an idea veri well adapt to humour don
quixot and effect their purpos and hi notion which he explain
to the barber wa that he himself should assum the disguis of a
wander damsel while the other should try as best he could to pass
for a squir and that thei should thu proce to where don quixot
wa and he pretend to be an aggriev and distress damsel
should ask a favour of him which as a valiant knighterr he could
not refus to grant and the favour he meant to ask him wa that he
should accompani her whither she would conduct him in order to redress
a wrong which a wick knight had done her while at the same time she
should entreat him not to requir her to remov her mask nor ask her
ani question touch her circumst until he had right her with
the wick knight and he had no doubt that don quixot would compli
with ani request made in these term and that in thi wai thei might
remov him and take him to hi own villag where thei would endeavour
to find out if hi extraordinari mad admit of ani kind of
remedi

full size
the curat plan did not seem a bad on to the barber but on the
contrari so good that thei immedi set about put it in
execut thei beg a petticoat and hood of the landladi leav
her in pledg a new cassock of the curat and the barber made a
beard out of a greybrown or red oxtail in which the landlord us to
stick hi comb the landladi ask them what thei want these thing
for and the curat told her in a few word about the mad of don
quixot and how thi disguis wa intend to get him awai from the
mountain where he then wa the landlord and landladi immedi came
to the conclus that the madman wa their guest the balsam man and
master of the blanket squir and thei told the curat all that had
pass between him and them not omit what sancho had been so
silent about final the landladi dress up the curat in a style
that left noth to be desir she put on him a cloth petticoat with
black velvet stripe a palm broad all slash and a bodic of green
velvet set off by a bind of white satin which as well as the
petticoat must have been made in the time of king wamba the curat
would not let them hood him but put on hi head a littl quilt linen
cap which he us for a nightcap and bound hi forehead with a strip
of black silk while with anoth he made a mask with which he
conceal hi beard and face veri well he then put on hi hat which
wa broad enough to serv him for an umbrella and envelop himself
in hi cloak seat himself womanfashion on hi mule while the barber
mount hi with a beard down to the waist of mingl red and white
for it wa as ha been said the tail of a clayr ox
thei took leav of all and of the good maritorn who sinner as she
wa promis to prai a rosari of prayer that god might grant them
success in such an arduou and christian undertak as that thei had
in hand but hardli had he salli forth from the inn when it struck
the curat that he wa do wrong in rig himself out in that
fashion as it wa an indecor thing for a priest to dress himself
that wai even though much might depend upon it and sai so to the
barber he beg him to chang dress as it wa fitter he should be
the distress damsel while he himself would plai the squir part
which would be less derogatori to hi digniti otherwis he wa
resolv to have noth more to do with the matter and let the devil
take don quixot just at thi moment sancho came up and on see the
pair in such a costum he wa unabl to restrain hi laughter the
barber howev agre to do as the curat wish and alter their
plan the curat went on to instruct him how to plai hi part and what
to sai to don quixot to induc and compel him to come with them and
give up hi fanci for the place he had chosen for hi idl penanc the
barber told him he could manag it properli without ani instruct
and as he did not care to dress himself up until thei were near where
don quixot wa he fold up the garment and the curat adjust hi
beard and thei set out under the guidanc of sancho panza who went
along tell them of the encount with the madman thei met in the
sierra sai noth howev about the find of the valis and
it content for with all hi simplic the lad wa a trifl
covet
the next dai thei reach the place where sancho had laid the
broombranch as mark to direct him to where he had left hi master
and recognis it he told them that here wa the entranc and that
thei would do well to dress themselv if that wa requir to deliv
hi master for thei had alreadi told him that go in thi guis and
dress in thi wai were of the highest import in order to rescu
hi master from the pernici life he had adopt and thei charg
him strictli not to tell hi master who thei were or that he knew
them and should he ask as ask he would if he had given the letter to
dulcinea to sai that he had and that as she did not know how to
read she had given an answer by word of mouth sai that she
command him on pain of her displeasur to come and see her at onc
and it wa a veri import matter for himself becaus in thi wai and
with what thei meant to sai to him thei felt sure of bring him back
to a better mode of life and induc him to take immedi step to
becom an emperor or monarch for there wa no fear of hi becom an
archbishop all thi sancho listen to and fix it well in hi
memori and thank them heartili for intend to recommend hi master
to be an emperor instead of an archbishop for he felt sure that in the
wai of bestow reward on their squir emperor could do more than
archbishopserr he said too that it would be as well for him to
go on befor them to find him and give him hi ladi answer for that
perhap might be enough to bring him awai from the place without
put them to all thi troubl thei approv of what sancho
propos and resolv to wait for him until he brought back word of
have found hi master
sancho push on into the glen of the sierra leav them in on
through which there flow a littl gentl rivulet and where the rock
and tree afford a cool and grate shade it wa an august dai with
all the heat of on and the heat in those part is intens and the
hour wa three in the afternoon all which made the spot the more
invit and tempt them to wait there for sancho return which thei
did thei were repos then in the shade when a voic unaccompani
by the note of ani instrument but sweet and pleas in it tone
reach their ear at which thei were not a littl astonish as the
place did not seem to them like quarter for on who sang so well
for though it is often said that shepherd of rare voic ar to be
found in the wood and field thi is rather a flight of the poet
fanci than the truth and still more surpris were thei when thei
perceiv that what thei heard sung were the vers not of rustic
shepherd but of the polish wit of the citi and so it prove for
the vers thei heard were these
what make my quest of happi seem vain
disdain
what bid me to abandon hope of eas
jealousi
what hold my heart in anguish of suspens
absenc
if that be so then for my grief
where shall i turn to seek relief
when hope on everi side li slain
by absenc jealousi disdain
what the prime caus of all my woe doth prove
love
what at my glori ever look askanc
chanc
whenc is permiss to afflict me given
heaven
if that be so i but await
the stroke of a resistless fate
sinc work for my woe these three
love chanc and heaven in leagu i see
what must i do to find a remedi
die
what is the lure for love when coi and strang
chang
what if all fail will cure the heart of sad
mad
if that be so it is but folli
to seek a cure for melancholi
ask where it li the answer saith
in chang in mad or in death
the hour the summer season the solitari place the voic and skill of
the singer all contribut to the wonder and delight of the two
listen who remain still wait to hear someth more find
howev that the silenc continu some littl time thei resolv to
go in search of the musician who sang with so fine a voic but just as
thei were about to do so thei were check by the same voic which
onc more fell upon their ear sing thi
sonnet
when heavenward holi friendship thou didst go
soar to seek thy home beyond the sky
and take thy seat among the saint on high
it wa thy will to leav on earth below
thy semblanc and upon it to bestow
thy veil wherewith at time hypocrisi
parad in thy shape deceiv the ey
and make it vile bright as virtu show
friendship return to us or forc the cheat
that wear it now thy liveri to restor
by aid whereof sincer is slain
if thou wilt not unmask thy counterfeit
thi earth will be the prei of strife onc more
as when primval discord held it reign
the song end with a deep sigh and again the listen remain
wait attent for the singer to resum but perceiv that the
music had now turn to sob and heartrend moan thei determin to
find out who the unhappi be could be whose voic wa as rare as hi
sigh were piteou and thei had not proceed far when on turn the
corner of a rock thei discov a man of the same aspect and
appear as sancho had describ to them when he told them the stori
of cardenio he show no astonish when he saw them stood still
with hi head bent down upon hi breast like on in deep thought
without rais hi ey to look at them after the first glanc when
thei suddenli came upon him the curat who wa awar of hi
misfortun and recognis him by the descript be a man of good
address approach him and in a few sensibl word entreat and urg
him to quit a life of such miseri lest he should end it there which
would be the greatest of all misfortun cardenio wa then in hi
right mind free from ani attack of that mad which so frequent
carri him awai and see them dress in a fashion so unusu among
the frequent of those wild could not help show some surpris
especi when he heard them speak of hi case as if it were a
wellknown matter for the curat word gave him to understand as
much so he repli to them thu
i see plainli sir whoever you mai be that heaven whose care it is
to succour the good and even the wick veri often here in thi
remot spot cut off from human intercours send me though i deserv
it not those who seek to draw me awai from thi to some better
retreat show me by mani and forcibl argument how unreason i
act in lead the life i do but as thei know that if i escap from
thi evil i shall fall into anoth still greater perhap thei will
set me down as a weakmind man or what is wors on devoid of
reason nor would it be ani wonder for i myself can perceiv that the
effect of the recollect of my misfortun is so great and work so
powerfulli to my ruin that in spite of myself i becom at time like a
stone without feel or conscious and i come to feel the truth
of it when thei tell me and show me proof of the thing i have done
when the terribl fit overmast me and all i can do is bewail my lot
in vain and idli curs my destini and plead for my mad by tell
how it wa caus to ani that care to hear it for no reason
be on learn the caus will wonder at the effect and if thei
cannot help me at least thei will not blame me and the repugn thei
feel at my wild wai will turn into piti for my woe if it be sir
that you ar here with the same design as other have come with befor
you proce with your wise argument i entreat you to hear the stori
of my countless misfortun for perhap when you have heard it you
will spare yourselv the troubl you would take in offer
consol to grief that is beyond the reach of it
as thei both of them desir noth more than to hear from hi own
lip the caus of hi suffer thei entreat him to tell it
promis not to do anyth for hi relief or comfort that he did not
wish and thereupon the unhappi gentleman began hi sad stori in nearli
the same word and manner in which he had relat it to don quixot and
the goatherd a few dai befor when through master elisabad and don
quixot scrupul observ of what wa due to chivalri the tale
wa left unfinish as thi histori ha alreadi record but now
fortun the mad fit kept off allow him to tell it to the end
and so come to the incid of the note which don fernando had found
in the volum of amadi of gaul cardenio said that he rememb it
perfectli and that it wa in these word
luscinda to cardenio
everi dai i discov merit in you that oblig and compel me to hold
you in higher estim so if you desir to reliev me of thi
oblig without cost to my honour you mai easili do so i have a
father who know you and love me dearli who without put ani
constraint on my inclin will grant what will be reason for you
to have if it be that you valu me as you sai and as i believ you
do
by thi letter i wa induc as i told you to demand luscinda for my
wife and it wa through it that luscinda came to be regard by don
fernando as on of the most discreet and prudent women of the dai and
thi letter it wa that suggest hi design of ruin me befor mine
could be carri into effect i told don fernando that all luscinda
father wa wait for wa that mine should ask her of him which i did
not dare to suggest to him fear that he would not consent to do so
not becaus he did not know perfectli well the rank good virtu
and beauti of luscinda and that she had qualiti that would do honour
to ani famili in spain but becaus i wa awar that he did not wish me
to marri so soon befor see what the duke ricardo would do for me
in short i told him i did not ventur to mention it to my father as
well on account of that difficulti as of mani other that discourag
me though i knew not well what thei were onli that it seem to me
that what i desir wa never to come to pass to all thi don fernando
answer that he would take it upon himself to speak to my father and
persuad him to speak to luscinda father o ambiti mariu o
cruel catilin o wick sylla o perfidi ganelon o treacher
vellido o vindict julian o covet juda traitor cruel
vindict and perfidi wherein had thi poor wretch fail in hi
fidel who with such frank show thee the secret and the joi
of hi heart what offenc did i commit what word did i utter or
what counsel did i give that had not the further of thy honour and
welfar for their aim but woe is me wherefor do i complain for
sure it is that when misfortun spring from the star descend from
on high thei fall upon us with such furi and violenc that no power on
earth can check their cours nor human devic stai their come who
could have thought that don fernando a highborn gentleman
intellig bound to me by gratitud for my servic on that could
win the object of hi love wherev he might set hi affect could
have becom so obdur as thei sai as to rob me of my on ew lamb
that wa not even yet in my possess but lai asid these useless
and unavail reflect let us take up the broken thread of my
unhappi stori
to proce then don fernando find my presenc an obstacl to the
execut of hi treacher and wick design resolv to send me to
hi elder brother under the pretext of ask monei from him to pai for
six hors which purpos and with the sole object of send me
awai that he might the better carri out hi infern scheme he had
purchas the veri dai he offer to speak to my father and the price
of which he now desir me to fetch could i have anticip thi
treacheri could i by ani chanc have suspect it nai so far from
that i offer with the greatest pleasur to go at onc in my
satisfact at the good bargain that had been made that night i spoke
with luscinda and told her what had been agre upon with don
fernando and how i had strong hope of our fair and reason wish
be realis she as unsuspici as i wa of the treacheri of don
fernando bade me try to return speedili as she believ the
fulfil of our desir would be delai onli so long as my father
put off speak to her i know not why it wa that on sai thi to
me her ey fill with tear and there came a lump in her throat that
prevent her from utter a word of mani more that it seem to me
she wa strive to sai to me i wa astonish at thi unusu turn
which i never befor observ in her for we alwai convers whenev
good fortun and my ingenu gave us the chanc with the greatest
gaieti and cheer mingl tear sigh jealousi doubt or
fear with our word it wa all on my part a eulogi of my good fortun
that heaven should have given her to me for my mistress i glorifi
her beauti i extol her worth and her understand and she paid me
back by prais in me what in her love for me she thought worthi of
prais and besid we had a hundr thousand trifl and do of our
neighbour and acquaint to talk about and the utmost extent of my
bold wa to take almost by forc on of her fair white hand and
carri it to my lip as well as the close of the low grate that
separ us allow me but the night befor the unhappi dai of my
departur she wept she moan she sigh and she withdrew leav me
fill with perplex and amaz overwhelm at the sight of such
strang and affect sign of grief and sorrow in luscinda but not to
dash my hope i ascrib it all to the depth of her love for me and the
pain that separ give those who love tenderli at last i took my
departur sad and deject my heart fill with fanci and
suspicion but not know well what it wa i suspect or fanci
plain omen point to the sad event and misfortun that wa await
me
i reach the place whither i had been sent gave the letter to don
fernando brother and wa kindli receiv but not promptli dismiss
for he desir me to wait veri much against my will eight dai in
some place where the duke hi father wa not like to see me as hi
brother wrote that the monei wa to be sent without hi knowledg all
of which wa a scheme of the treacher don fernando for hi brother
had no want of monei to enabl him to despatch me at onc
the command wa on that expos me to the temptat of disobei
it as it seem to me imposs to endur life for so mani dai
separ from luscinda especi after leav her in the sorrow
mood i have describ to you nevertheless as a duti servant i
obei though i felt it would be at the cost of my wellb but
four dai later there came a man in quest of me with a letter which he
gave me and which by the address i perceiv to be from luscinda as
the write wa her i open it with fear and trepid persuad
that it must be someth seriou that had impel her to write to me
when at a distanc as she seldom did so when i wa near befor
read it i ask the man who it wa that had given it to him and how

such in brief were the word of the letter word that made me set
out at onc without wait ani longer for repli or monei for i now
saw clearli that it wa not the purchas of hors but of hi own
pleasur that had made don fernando send me to hi brother the
exasper i felt against don fernando join with the fear of
lose the prize i had won by so mani year of love and devot lent
me wing so that almost fly i reach home the same dai by the
hour which serv for speak with luscinda i arriv unobserv and
left the mule on which i had come at the hous of the worthi man who
had brought me the letter and fortun wa pleas to be for onc so
kind that i found luscinda at the grate that wa the wit of our
love she recognis me at onc and i her but not as she ought to
have recognis me or i her but who is there in the world that can
boast of have fathom or understood the waver mind and unstabl
natur of a woman of a truth no on to proce as soon as luscinda
saw me she said cardenio i am in my bridal dress and the
treacher don fernando and my covet father ar wait for me in

dagger to save thy honour i have a sword to defend thee or kill myself
if fortun be against us
i think she could not have heard all these word for i perceiv that
thei call her awai in hast as the bridegroom wa wait now the
night of my sorrow set in the sun of my happi went down i felt my
ey bereft of sight my mind of reason i could not enter the hous
nor wa i capabl of ani movement but reflect how import it wa
that i should be present at what might take place on the occas i
nerv myself as best i could and went in for i well knew all the
entranc and outlet and besid with the confus that in secret
pervad the hous no on took notic of me so without be seen i
found an opportun of place myself in the recess form by a window
of the hall itself and conceal by the end and border of two
tapestri from between which i could without be seen see all
that took place in the room who could describ the agit of heart
i suffer as i stood thereth thought that came to meth
reflect that pass through my mind thei were such as cannot be
nor were it well thei should be told suffic it to sai that the
bridegroom enter the hall in hi usual dress without ornament of ani
kind as groomsman he had with him a cousin of luscinda and except
the servant of the hous there wa no on els in the chamber soon
afterward luscinda came out from an antechamb attend by her
mother and two of her damsel arrai and adorn as becam her rank
and beauti and in full festiv and ceremoni attir my anxieti and
distract did not allow me to observ or notic particularli what she
wore i could onli perceiv the colour which were crimson and white
and the glitter of the gem and jewel on her head dress and apparel
surpass by the rare beauti of her love auburn hair that vy with
the preciou stone and the light of the four torch that stood in the
hall shone with a brighter gleam than all oh memori mortal foe of my
peac why bring befor me now the incompar beauti of that ador
enemi of mine were it not better cruel memori to remind me and
recal what she then did that stir by a wrong so glare i mai
seek if not vengeanc now at least to rid myself of life be not
weari sir of listen to these digress my sorrow is not on of
those that can or should be told ters and briefli for to me each
incid seem to call for mani word
to thi the curat repli that not onli were thei not weari of
listen to him but that the detail he mention interest them
greatli be of a kind by no mean to be omit and deserv of the
same attent as the main stori
to proce then continu cardenio all be assembl in the
hall the priest of the parish came in and as he took the pair by the
hand to perform the requisit ceremoni at the word will you seora
luscinda take seor don fernando here present for your law
husband as the holi mother church ordain i thrust my head and neck
out from between the tapestri and with eager ear and throb
heart set myself to listen to luscinda answer await in her repli
the sentenc of death or the grant of life oh that i had but dare at
that moment to rush forward cry aloud luscinda luscinda have a
care what thou dost rememb what thou owest me bethink thee thou art
mine and canst not be anoth reflect that thy utter of ye
and the end of my life will come at the same instant o treacher
don fernando robber of my glori death of my life what seekest thou
rememb that thou canst not as a christian attain the object of thy
wish for luscinda is my bride and i am her husband fool that i
am now that i am far awai and out of danger i sai i should have done
what i did not do now that i have allow my preciou treasur to be
rob from me i curs the robber on whom i might have taken
vengeanc had i as much heart for it as i have for bewail my fate
in short as i wa then a coward and a fool littl wonder is it if i
am now dy shamestricken remors and mad
the priest stood wait for the answer of luscinda who for a long
time withheld it and just as i thought she wa take out the dagger
to save her honour or struggl for word to make some declar of
the truth on my behalf i heard her sai in a faint and feebl voic i
will don fernando said the same and give her the ring thei stood
link by a knot that could never be loos the bridegroom then
approach to embrac hi bride and she press her hand upon her
heart fell faint in her mother arm it onli remain now for me
to tell you the state i wa in when in that consent that i heard i saw
all my hope mock the word and promis of luscinda prove
falsehood and the recoveri of the prize i had that instant lost
render imposs for ever i stood stupefi wholli abandon it
seem by heaven declar the enemi of the earth that bore me the
air refus me breath for my sigh the water moistur for my tear
it wa onli the fire that gather strength so that my whole frame
glow with rage and jealousi thei were all thrown into confus by
luscinda faint and as her mother wa unlac her to give her air
a seal paper wa discov in her bosom which don fernando seiz at
onc and began to read by the light of on of the torch as soon as
he had read it he seat himself in a chair lean hi cheek on hi
hand in the attitud of on deep in thought without take ani part in
the effort that were be made to recov hi bride from her faint
fit
see all the household in confus i ventur to come out
regardless whether i were seen or not and determin if i were to do
some frenzi deed that would prove to all the world the righteou
indign of my breast in the punish of the treacher don
fernando and even in that of the fickl faint traitress but my
fate doubtless reserv me for greater sorrow if such there be so
order it that just then i had enough and to spare of that reason
which ha sinc been want to me and so without seek to take
vengeanc on my greatest enemi which might have been easili taken
as all thought of me wa so far from their mind i resolv to take
it upon myself and on myself to inflict the pain thei deserv
perhap with even greater sever than i should have dealt out to them
had i then slain them for sudden pain is soon over but that which is
protract by tortur is ever slai without end life in a word
i quit the hous and reach that of the man with whom i had left my
mule i made him saddl it for me mount without bid him
farewel and rode out of the citi like anoth lot not dare to
turn my head to look back upon it and when i found myself alon in the
open countri screen by the dark of the night and tempt by the
still to give vent to my grief without apprehens or fear of
be heard or seen then i broke silenc and lift up my voic in
maledict upon luscinda and don fernando as if i could thu aveng
the wrong thei had done me i call her cruel ungrat fals
thankless but abov all covet sinc the wealth of my enemi had
blind the ey of her affect and turn it from me to transfer it
to on to whom fortun had been more gener and liber and yet in
the midst of thi outburst of execr and upbraid i found
excus for her sai it wa no wonder that a young girl in the
seclus of her parent hous train and school to obei them
alwai should have been readi to yield to their wish when thei
offer her for a husband a gentleman of such distinct wealth and
nobl birth that if she had refus to accept him she would have been
thought out of her sens or to have set her affect elsewher a
suspicion injuri to her fair name and fame but then again i said
had she declar i wa her husband thei would have seen that in
choos me she had not chosen so ill but that thei might excus her
for befor don fernando had made hi offer thei themselv could not
have desir if their desir had been rule by reason a more
elig husband for their daughter than i wa and she befor take
the last fatal step of give her hand might easili have said that i
had alreadi given her mine for i should have come forward to support
ani assert of her to that effect in short i came to the
conclus that feebl love littl reflect great ambit and a
crave for rank had made her forget the word with which she had
deceiv me encourag and support by my firm hope and honour
passion
thu soliloquis and agit i journei onward for the remaind
of the night and by daybreak i reach on of the pass of these
mountain among which i wander for three dai more without take
ani path or road until i came to some meadow ly on i know not
which side of the mountain and there i inquir of some herdsmen in
what direct the most rug part of the rang lai thei told me that
it wa in thi quarter and i at onc direct my cours hither
intend to end my life here but as i wa make my wai among these
crag my mule drop dead through fatigu and hunger or as i think
more like in order to have done with such a worthless burden as it
bore in me i wa left on foot worn out famish without anyon to
help me or ani thought of seek help and so thu i lai stretch on
the ground how long i know not after which i rose up free from
hunger and found besid me some goatherd who no doubt were the
person who had reliev me in my need for thei told me how thei had
found me and how i had been utter rave that show plainli i had
lost my reason and sinc then i am consciou that i am not alwai in
full possess of it but at time so derang and craze that i do a
thousand mad thing tear my cloth cry aloud in these
solitud curs my fate and idli call on the dear name of her
who is my enemi and onli seek to end my life in lament and
when i recov my sens i find myself so exhaust and weari that i
can scarc move most commonli my dwell is the hollow of a cork
tree larg enough to shelter thi miser bodi the herdsmen and
goatherd who frequent these mountain move by compass furnish me
with food leav it by the waysid or on the rock where thei think
i mai perhap pass and find it and so even though i mai be then out
of my sens the want of natur teach me what is requir to sustain
me and make me crave it and eager to take it at other time so thei
tell me when thei find me in a ration mood i salli out upon the
road and though thei would gladli give it me i snatch food by forc
from the shepherd bring it from the villag to their hut thu do
pass the wretch life that remain to me until it be heaven will to
bring it to a close or so to order my memori that i no longer
recollect the beauti and treacheri of luscinda or the wrong done me by
don fernando for if it will do thi without depriv me of life i
will turn my thought into some better channel if not i can onli
implor it to have full merci on my soul for in myself i feel no power
or strength to releas my bodi from thi strait in which i have of my
own accord chosen to place it
such sir is the dismal stori of my misfortun sai if it be on
that can be told with less emot than you have seen in me and do not
troubl yourselv with urg or press upon me what reason suggest
as like to serv for my relief for it will avail me as much as the
medicin prescrib by a wise physician avail the sick man who will
not take it i have no wish for health without luscinda and sinc it
is her pleasur to be anoth when she is or should be mine let it
be mine to be a prei to miseri when i might have enjoi happi she
by her fickl strove to make my ruin irretriev i will strive
to gratifi her wish by seek destruct and it will show
gener to come that i alon wa depriv of that of which all
other in misfortun have a superabund for to them the
imposs of be consol is itself a consol while to me it
is the caus of greater sorrow and suffer for i think that even
in death there will not be an end of them
here cardenio brought to a close hi long discours and stori as full
of misfortun as it wa of love but just as the curat wa go to
address some word of comfort to him he wa stop by a voic that
reach hi ear sai in melancholi tone what will be told in the
fourth part of thi narr for at thi point the sage and sagaci
historian cid hamet beneng brought the third to a conclus

happi and fortun were the time when that most dare knight don
quixot of la mancha wa sent into the world for by reason of hi

and restor to the world the longlost and almost defunct order of
knighterrantri we now enjoi in thi ag of our so poor in light
entertain not onli the charm of hi veraci histori but also of
the tale and episod contain in it which ar in a measur no less
pleas ingeni and truth than the histori itself which
resum it thread card spun and wound relat that just as the
curat wa go to offer consol to cardenio he wa interrupt
by a voic that fell upon hi ear sai in plaintiv tone
o god is it possibl i have found a place that mai serv as a secret
grave for the weari load of thi bodi that i support so unwillingli if
the solitud these mountain promis deceiv me not it is so ah woe
is me how much more grate to my mind will be the societi of these
rock and brake that permit me to complain of my misfortun to heaven
than that of ani human be for there is none on earth to look to for
counsel in doubt comfort in sorrow or relief in distress
all thi wa heard distinctli by the curat and those with him and as
it seem to them to be utter close by as inde it wa thei got up
to look for the speaker and befor thei had gone twenti pace thei
discov behind a rock seat at the foot of an ash tree a youth in
the dress of a peasant whose face thei were unabl at the moment to
see as he wa lean forward bath hi feet in the brook that
flow past thei approach so silent that he did not perceiv them
be fulli occupi in bath hi feet which were so fair that thei
look like two piec of shine crystal brought forth among the other
stone of the brook the white and beauti of these feet struck them
with surpris for thei did not seem to have been made to crush clod
or to follow the plough and the oxen as their owner dress suggest
and so find thei had not been notic the curat who wa in
front made a sign to the other two to conceal themselv behind some
fragment of rock that lai there which thei did observ close
what the youth wa about he had on a loos doubleskirt dark brown
jacket bound tight to hi bodi with a white cloth he wore besid
breech and gaiter of brown cloth and on hi head a brown montera
and he had the gaiter turn up as far as the middl of the leg which
verili seem to be of pure alabast

as soon as he had done bath hi beauti feet he wipe them with a
towel he took from under the montera on take off which he rais hi
face and those who were watch him had an opportun of see a
beauti so exquisit that cardenio said to the curat in a whisper
as thi is not luscinda it is no human creatur but a divin be
the youth then took off the montera and shake hi head from side to
side there broke loos and spread out a mass of hair that the beam of
the sun might have envi by thi thei knew that what had seem a
peasant wa a love woman nai the most beauti the ey of two of
them had ever beheld or even cardenio if thei had not seen and known
luscinda for he afterward declar that onli the beauti of luscinda
could compar with thi the long auburn tress not onli cover her
shoulder but such wa their length and abund conceal her all
round beneath their mass so that except the feet noth of her form
wa visibl she now us her hand as a comb and if her feet had
seem like bit of crystal in the water her hand look like piec
of driven snow among her lock all which increas not onli the
admir of the three behold but their anxieti to learn who she
wa with thi object thei resolv to show themselv and at the stir
thei made in get upon their feet the fair damsel rais her head
and part her hair from befor her ey with both hand she look
to see who had made the nois and the instant she perceiv them she
start to her feet and without wait to put on her shoe or gather
up her hair hastili snatch up a bundl as though of cloth that she
had besid her and scare and alarm endeavour to take flight
but befor she had gone six pace she fell to the ground her delic
feet be unabl to bear the rough of the stone see which
the three hasten toward her and the curat address her first
said
stai seora whoever you mai be for those whom you see here onli
desir to be of servic to you you have no need to attempt a flight so
heedless for neither can your feet bear it nor we allow it
taken by surpris and bewild she made no repli to these word
thei howev came toward her and the curat take her hand went on
to sai
what your dress would hide seora is made known to us by your hair
a clear proof that it can be no trifl caus that ha disguis your
beauti in a garb so unworthi of it and sent it into solitud like
these where we have had the good fortun to find you if not to reliev
your distress at least to offer you comfort for no distress so long
as life last can be so oppress or reach such a height as to make
the suffer refus to listen to comfort offer with good intent
and so seora or seor or whatev you prefer to be dismiss the
fear that our appear ha caus you and make us acquaint with
your good or evil fortun for from all of us togeth or from each
on of us you will receiv sympathi in your troubl
while the curat wa speak the disguis damsel stood as if
spellbound look at them without open her lip or utter a
word just like a villag rustic to whom someth strang that he ha
never seen befor ha been suddenli shown but on the curat address
some further word to the same effect to her sigh deepli she broke
silenc and said
sinc the solitud of these mountain ha been unabl to conceal me
and the escap of my dishevel tress will not allow my tongu to
deal in falsehood it would be idl for me now to make ani further
pretenc of what if you were to believ me you would believ more out
of courtesi than for ani other reason thi be so i sai i thank
you sir for the offer you have made me which place me under the
oblig of compli with the request you have made of me though i
fear the account i shall give you of my misfortun will excit in you
as much concern as compass for you will be unabl to suggest
anyth to remedi them or ani consol to allevi them howev
that my honour mai not be left a matter of doubt in your mind now
that you have discov me to be a woman and see that i am young
alon and in thi dress thing that taken togeth or separ
would be enough to destroi ani good name i feel bound to tell what i
would willingli keep secret if i could
all thi she who wa now seen to be a love woman deliv without
ani hesit with so much eas and in so sweet a voic that thei
were not less charm by her intellig than by her beauti and as
thei again repeat their offer and entreati to her to fulfil her
promis she without further press first modestli cover her feet
and gather up her hair seat herself on a stone with the three
place around her and after an effort to restrain some tear that
came to her ey in a clear and steadi voic began her stori thu
in thi andalusia there is a town from which a duke take a titl
which make him on of those that ar call grande of spain thi
nobleman ha two son the elder heir to hi digniti and appar to
hi good qualiti the younger heir to i know not what unless it be
the treacheri of vellido and the falsehood of ganelon my parent ar
thi lord vassal lowli in origin but so wealthi that if birth had
confer as much on them as fortun thei would have had noth left
to desir nor should i have had reason to fear troubl like that in
which i find myself now for it mai be that my ill fortun came of
their in not have been nobli born it is true thei ar not so low
that thei have ani reason to be asham of their condit but neither
ar thei so high as to remov from my mind the impress that my
mishap come of their humbl birth thei ar in short peasant plain
home peopl without ani taint of disreput blood and as the
sai is old rusti christian but so rich that by their wealth and
freehand wai of life thei ar come by degre to be consid
gentlefolk by birth and even by posit though the wealth and
nobil thei thought most of wa have me for their daughter and as
thei have no other child to make their heir and ar affection
parent i wa on of the most indulg daughter that ever parent
indulg
i wa the mirror in which thei beheld themselv the staff of their
old ag and the object in which with submiss to heaven all their
wish centr and mine were in accord with their for i knew
their worth and as i wa mistress of their heart so wa i also of
their possess through me thei engag or dismiss their servant
through my hand pass the account and return of what wa sown and
reap the oilmil the winepress the count of the flock and
herd the beehiv all in short that a rich farmer like my father ha
or can have i had under my care and i act as steward and mistress
with an assidu on my part and satisfact on their that i cannot
well describ to you the leisur hour left to me after i had given
the requisit order to the headshepherd overs and other
labour i pass in such employ as ar not onli allow but
necessari for young girl those that the needl embroideri cushion
and spin wheel usual afford and if to refresh my mind i quit
them for a while i found recreat in read some devot book or
plai the harp for experi taught me that music sooth the
troubl mind and reliev weari of spirit such wa the life i led
in my parent hous and if i have depict it thu minut it is not
out of ostent or to let you know that i am rich but that you mai
see how without ani fault of mine i have fallen from the happi
condit i have describ to the miseri i am in at present the truth
is that while i wa lead thi busi life in a retir that might
compar with that of a monasteri and unseen as i thought by ani except
the servant of the hous for when i went to mass it wa so earli in
the morn and i wa so close attend by my mother and the women
of the household and so thickli veil and so shy that my ey
scarc saw more ground than i trod on in spite of all thi the
ey of love or idl more properli speak that the lynx
cannot rival discov me with the help of the assidu of don
fernando for that is the name of the younger son of the duke i told
of
the moment the speaker mention the name of don fernando cardenio
chang colour and broke into a sweat with such sign of emot that
the curat and the barber who observ it fear that on of the mad
fit which thei heard attack him sometim wa come upon him but
cardenio show no further agit and remain quiet regard the
peasant girl with fix attent for he began to suspect who she wa
she howev without notic the excit of cardenio continu
her stori went on to sai
and thei had hardli discov me when as he own afterward he
wa smitten with a violent love for me as the manner in which it
displai itself plainli show but to shorten the long recit of my
woe i will pass over in silenc all the artific emploi by don
fernando for declar hi passion for me he bribe all the household
he gave and offer gift and present to my parent everi dai wa
like a holidai or a merrymak in our street by night no on could
sleep for the music the love letter that us to come to my hand no
on knew how were innumer full of tender plead and pledg
contain more promis and oath than there were letter in them all
which not onli did not soften me but harden my heart against him as
if he had been my mortal enemi and as if everyth he did to make me
yield were done with the opposit intent not that the highbr
bear of don fernando wa disagre to me or that i found hi
importun wearisom for it gave me a certain sort of satisfact
to find myself so sought and prize by a gentleman of such distinct
and i wa not displeas at see my prais in hi letter for
howev ugli we women mai be it seem to me it alwai pleas us to
hear ourselv call beauti but that my own sens of right wa
oppos to all thi as well as the repeat advic of my parent who
now veri plainli perceiv don fernando purpos for he care veri
littl if all the world knew it thei told me thei trust and confid
their honour and good name to my virtu and rectitud alon and bade
me consid the dispar between don fernando and myself from which i
might conclud that hi intent whatev he might sai to the
contrari had for their aim hi own pleasur rather than my advantag
and if i were at all desir of oppos an obstacl to hi
unreason suit thei were readi thei said to marri me at onc to
anyon i prefer either among the lead peopl of our own town or
of ani of those in the neighbourhood for with their wealth and my good
name a match might be look for in ani quarter thi offer and their
sound advic strengthen my resolut and i never gave don fernando

when cardenio heard her sai she wa call dorothea he show fresh
agit and felt convinc of the truth of hi former suspicion but
he wa unwil to interrupt the stori and wish to hear the end of
what he alreadi all but knew so he mere said
what is dorothea your name seora i have heard of anoth of the
same name who can perhap match your misfortun but proce
byandbi i mai tell you someth that will astonish you as much as it
will excit your compass
dorothea wa struck by cardenio word as well as by hi strang and
miser attir and beg him if he knew anyth concern her to
tell it to her at onc for if fortun had left her ani bless it wa
courag to bear whatev calam might fall upon her as she felt sure
that none could reach her capabl of increas in ani degre what she
endur alreadi
i would not let the occas pass seora repli cardenio of
tell you what i think if what i suspect were the truth but so far
there ha been no opportun nor is it of ani import to you to
know it
be it as it mai repli dorothea what happen in my stori wa
that don fernando take an imag that stood in the chamber place it
as a wit of our betroth and with the most bind word and
extravag oath gave me hi promis to becom my husband though
befor he had made an end of pledg himself i bade him consid well
what he wa do and think of the anger hi father would feel at
see him marri to a peasant girl and on of hi vassal i told him
not to let my beauti such as it wa blind him for that wa not
enough to furnish an excus for hi transgress and if in the love
he bore me he wish to do me ani kind it would be to leav my lot
to follow it cours at the level my condit requir for marriag
so unequ never brought happi nor did thei continu long to
afford the enjoy thei began with
all thi that i have now repeat i said to him and much more which i
cannot recollect but it had no effect in induc him to forego hi
purpos he who ha no intent of pai doe not troubl himself
about difficulti when he is strike the bargain at the same time i
argu the matter briefli in my own mind sai to myself i shall
not be the first who ha risen through marriag from a lowli to a lofti
station nor will don fernando be the first whom beauti or as is more
like a blind attach ha led to mate himself below hi rank
then sinc i am introduc no new usag or practic i mai as well
avail myself of the honour that chanc offer me for even though hi
inclin for me should not outlast the attain of hi wish i
shall be after all hi wife befor god and if i strive to repel him
by scorn i can see that fair mean fail he is in a mood to us
forc and i shall be left dishonour and without ani mean of prove
my innoc to those who cannot know how innoc i have come to be
in thi posit for what argument would persuad my parent that
thi gentleman enter my chamber without my consent
all these question and answer pass through my mind in a moment
but the oath of don fernando the wit he appeal to the tear
he shed and lastli the charm of hi person and hi highbr grace
which accompani by such sign of genuin love might well have
conquer a heart even more free and coi than minethes were the
thing that more than all began to influenc me and lead me unawar to
my ruin i call my waitingmaid to me that there might be a wit
on earth besid those in heaven and again don fernando renew and
repeat hi oath invok as wit fresh saint in addit to
the former on call down upon himself a thousand curs hereaft
should he fail to keep hi promis shed more tear redoubl hi
sigh and press me closer in hi arm from which he had never
allow me to escap and so i wa left by my maid and ceas to be
on and he becam a traitor and a perjur man
the dai which follow the night of my misfortun did not come so
quickli i imagin as don fernando wish for when desir ha
attain it object the greatest pleasur is to fly from the scene of
pleasur i sai so becaus don fernando made all hast to leav me and
by the adroit of my maid who wa inde the on who had admit
him gain the street befor daybreak but on take leav of me he
told me though not with as much earnest and fervour as when he
came that i might rest assur of hi faith and of the sanctiti and
sincer of hi oath and to confirm hi word he drew a rich ring
off hi finger and place it upon mine he then took hi departur and
i wa left i know not whether sorrow or happi all i can sai is i
wa left agit and troubl in mind and almost bewild by what
had taken place and i had not the spirit or els it did not occur to
me to chide my maid for the treacheri she had been guilti of in
conceal don fernando in my chamber for as yet i wa unabl to make
up my mind whether what had befallen me wa for good or evil i told
don fernando at part that as i wa now hi he might see me on
other night in the same wai until it should be hi pleasur to let
the matter becom known but except the follow night he came no
more nor for more than a month could i catch a glimps of him in the
street or in church while i weari myself with watch for on
although i knew he wa in the town and almost everi dai went out
hunt a pastim he wa veri fond of i rememb well how sad and
dreari those dai and hour were to me i rememb well how i began to
doubt as thei went by and even to lose confid in the faith of don
fernando and i rememb too how my maid heard those word in reproof
of her audac that she had not heard befor and how i wa forc to
put a constraint on my tear and on the express of my counten
not to give my parent caus to ask me why i wa so melancholi and
drive me to invent falsehood in repli but all thi wa suddenli
brought to an end for the time came when all such consider were
disregard and there wa no further question of honour when my
patienc gave wai and the secret of my heart becam known abroad the
reason wa that a few dai later it wa report in the town that don
fernando had been marri in a neighbour citi to a maiden of rare
beauti the daughter of parent of distinguish posit though not
so rich that her portion would entitl her to look for so brilliant a
match it wa said too that her name wa luscinda and that at the
betroth some strang thing had happen
cardenio heard the name of luscinda but he onli shrug hi
shoulder bit hi lip bent hi brow and befor long two stream of
tear escap from hi ey dorothea howev did not interrupt her
stori but went on in these word
thi sad intellig reach my ear and instead of be struck
with a chill with such wrath and furi did my heart burn that i
scarc restrain myself from rush out into the street cry
aloud and proclaim openli the perfidi and treacheri of which i wa
the victim but thi transport of rage wa for the time check by a
resolut i form to be carri out the same night and that wa to
assum thi dress which i got from a servant of my father on of
the zagal as thei ar call in farmhous to whom i confid the
whole of my misfortun and whom i entreat to accompani me to the
citi where i heard my enemi wa he though he remonstr with me for
my bold and condemn my resolut when he saw me bent upon my
purpos offer to bear me compani as he said to the end of the
world i at onc pack up in a linen pillowcas a woman dress and
some jewel and monei to provid for emerg and in the silenc of
the night without let my treacher maid know i salli forth
from the hous accompani by my servant and abund anxieti and
on foot set out for the citi but born as it were on wing by my
eager to reach it if not to prevent what i presum to be alreadi
done at least to call upon don fernando to tell me with what
conscienc he had done it i reach my destin in two dai and a
half and on enter the citi inquir for the hous of luscinda
parent the first person i ask gave me more in repli than i sought
to know he show me the hous and told me all that had occur at
the betroth of the daughter of the famili an affair of such
notorieti in the citi that it wa the talk of everi knot of idler in
the street he said that on the night of don fernando betroth with
luscinda as soon as she had consent to be hi bride by sai ye
she wa taken with a sudden faint fit and that on the bridegroom
approach to unlac the bosom of her dress to give her air he found
a paper in her own handwrit in which she said and declar that she
could not be don fernando bride becaus she wa alreadi cardenio
who accord to the man account wa a gentleman of distinct of
the same citi and that if she had accept don fernando it wa onli
in obedi to her parent in short he said the word of the paper
made it clear she meant to kill herself on the complet of the
betroth and gave her reason for put an end to herself all which
wa confirm it wa said by a dagger thei found somewher in her
cloth on see thi don fernando persuad that luscinda had
befool slight and trifl with him assail her befor she had
recov from her swoon and tri to stab her with the dagger that
had been found and would have succeed had not her parent and those
who were present prevent him it wa said moreov that don
fernando went awai at onc and that luscinda did not recov from her
prostrat until the next dai when she told her parent how she wa
realli the bride of that cardenio i have mention i learn besid
that cardenio accord to report had been present at the betroth
and that upon see her betroth contrari to hi expect he had
quit the citi in despair leav behind him a letter declar the
wrong luscinda had done him and hi intent of go where no on
should ever see him again all thi wa a matter of notorieti in the
citi and everyon spoke of it especi when it becam known that
luscinda wa miss from her father hous and from the citi for she
wa not to be found anywher to the distract of her parent who
knew not what step to take to recov her what i learn reviv my
hope and i wa better pleas not to have found don fernando than to
find him marri for it seem to me that the door wa not yet
entir shut upon relief in my case and i thought that perhap heaven
had put thi impedi in the wai of the second marriag to lead him
to recognis hi oblig under the former on and reflect that as
a christian he wa bound to consid hi soul abov all human object
all thi pass through my mind and i strove to comfort myself without
comfort indulg in faint and distant hope of cherish that life
that i now abhor
but while i wa in the citi uncertain what to do as i could not find
don fernando i heard notic given by the public crier offer a great
reward to anyon who should find me and give the particular of my
ag and of the veri dress i wore and i heard it said that the lad who
came with me had taken me awai from my father hous a thing that cut
me to the heart show how low my good name had fallen sinc it wa
not enough that i should lose it by my flight but thei must add with
whom i had fled and that on so much beneath me and so unworthi of my
consider the instant i heard the notic i quit the citi with
my servant who now began to show sign of waver in hi fidel to
me and the same night for fear of discoveri we enter the most
thickli wood part of these mountain but as is commonli said on
evil call up anoth and the end of on misfortun is apt to be the
begin of on still greater and so it prove in my case for my
worthi servant until then so faith and trusti when he found me in
thi lone spot move more by hi own villaini than by my beauti
sought to take advantag of the opportun which these solitud
seem to present him and with littl shame and less fear of god and
respect for me began to make overtur to me and find that i
repli to the effronteri of hi propos with justli sever languag
he laid asid the entreati which he had emploi at first and began
to us violenc

but just heaven that seldom fail to watch over and aid good
intent so aid mine that with my slight strength and with littl
exert i push him over a precipic where i left him whether dead
or aliv i know not and then with greater speed than seem possibl
in my terror and fatigu i made my wai into the mountain without ani
other thought or purpos save that of hide myself among them and
escap my father and those despatch in search of me by hi order
it is now i know not how mani month sinc with thi object i came
here where i met a herdsman who engag me as hi servant at a place
in the heart of thi sierra and all thi time i have been serv him
as herd strive to keep alwai afield to hide these lock which have
now unexpectedli betrai me but all my care and pain were
unavail for my master made the discoveri that i wa not a man and
harbour the same base design as my servant and as fortun doe not
alwai suppli a remedi in case of difficulti and i had no precipic
or ravin at hand down which to fling the master and cure hi passion
as i had in the servant case i thought it a lesser evil to leav him
and again conceal myself among these crag than make trial of my
strength and argument with him so as i sai onc more i went into
hide to seek for some place where i might with sigh and tear
implor heaven to have piti on my miseri and grant me help and
strength to escap from it or let me die among the solitud leav

for both commend the sound reason of cardenio and lastli
beg advis and urg them to come with him to hi villag where
thei might furnish themselv with what thei need and take measur
to discov don fernando or restor dorothea to her parent or do

servic in ani wai that might be of us to them he also explain to
them in a few word the object that had brought them there and the
strang natur of don quixot mad and how thei were wait for
hi squir who had gone in search of him like the recollect of a
dream the quarrel he had had with don quixot came back to cardenio
memori and he describ it to the other but he wa unabl to sai
what the disput wa about
c29bjpg 351k

at thi moment thei heard a shout and recognis it as come from
sancho panza who not find them where he had left them wa call
aloud to them thei went to meet him and in answer to their inquiri
about don quixot he told them how he had found him strip to hi
shirt lank yellow half dead with hunger and sigh for hi ladi
dulcinea and although he had told him that she command him to quit
that place and come to el toboso where she wa expect him he had
answer that he wa determin not to appear in the presenc of her
beauti until he had done deed to make him worthi of her favour and if
thi went on sancho said he ran the risk of not becom an emperor
as in duti bound or even an archbishop which wa the least he could
be for which reason thei ought to consid what wa to be done to get
him awai from there the licenti in repli told him not to be uneasi
for thei would fetch him awai in spite of himself he then told
cardenio and dorothea what thei had propos to do to cure don quixot
or at ani rate take him home upon which dorothea said that she could
plai the distress damsel better than the barber especi as she
had there the dress in which to do it to the life and that thei might
trust to her act the part in everi particular requisit for carri
out their scheme for she had read a great mani book of chivalri and
knew exactli the style in which afflict damsel beg boon of
knightserr
in that case said the curat there is noth more requir than
to set about it at onc for beyond a doubt fortun is declar itself
in our favour sinc it ha so unexpectedli begun to open a door for
your relief and smooth the wai for us to our object
dorothea then took out of her pillowcas a complet petticoat of some
rich stuff and a green mantl of some other fine materi and a
necklac and other ornament out of a littl box and with these in an
instant she so arrai herself that she look like a great and rich
ladi all thi and more she said she had taken from home in case of
need but that until then she had had no occas to make us of it
thei were all highli delight with her grace air and beauti and
declar don fernando to be a man of veri littl tast when he reject
such charm but the on who admir her most wa sancho panza for it
seem to him what inde wa true that in all the dai of hi life
he had never seen such a love creatur and he ask the curat with
great eager who thi beauti ladi wa and what she want in
these outofthewai quarter
thi fair ladi brother sancho repli the curat is no less a
personag than the heiress in the direct male line of the great kingdom
of micomicon who ha come in search of your master to beg a boon of
him which is that he redress a wrong or injuri that a wick giant ha
done her and from the fame as a good knight which your master ha
acquir far and wide thi princess ha come from guinea to seek him
a lucki seek and a lucki find said sancho panza at thi
especi if my master ha the good fortun to redress that injuri
and right that wrong and kill that son of a bitch of a giant your
worship speak of as kill him he will if he meet him unless inde
he happen to be a phantom for my master ha no power at all against
phantom but on thing among other i would beg of you seor
licenti which is that to prevent my master take a fanci to be
an archbishop for that is what im afraid of your worship would
recommend him to marri thi princess at onc for in thi wai he will
be disabl from take archbishop order and will easili come into
hi empir and i to the end of my desir i have been think over
the matter carefulli and by what i can make out i find it will not do
for me that my master should becom an archbishop becaus i am no good
for the church as i am marri and for me now have as i have a
wife and children to set about obtain dispens to enabl me to
hold a place of profit under the church would be endless work so
that seor it all turn on my master marri thi ladi at oncefor
as yet i do not know her grace and so i cannot call her by her name
she is call the princess micomicona said the curat for as her
kingdom is micomicon it is clear that must be her name
there no doubt of that repli sancho for i have known mani to
take their name and titl from the place where thei were born and call
themselv pedro of alcal juan of beda and diego of valladolid and
it mai be that over there in guinea queen have the same wai of take
the name of their kingdom
so it mai said the curat and as for your master marri i
will do all in my power toward it with which sancho wa as much
pleas as the curat wa amaz at hi simplic and at see what a
hold the absurd of hi master had taken of hi fanci for he had
evid persuad himself that he wa go to be an emperor
by thi time dorothea had seat herself upon the curat mule and
the barber had fit the oxtail beard to hi face and thei now told
sancho to conduct them to where don quixot wa warn him not to sai
that he knew either the licenti or the barber as hi master
becom an emperor entir depend on hi not recognis them
neither the curat nor cardenio howev thought fit to go with them
cardenio lest he should remind don quixot of the quarrel he had with
him and the curat as there wa no necess for hi presenc just
yet so thei allow the other to go on befor them while thei
themselv follow slowli on foot the curat did not forget to
instruct dorothea how to act but she said thei might make their mind
easi as everyth would be done exactli as the book of chivalri
requir and describ

thei had gone about threequart of a leagu when thei discov don
quixot in a wilder of rock by thi time cloth but without hi
armour and as soon as dorothea saw him and wa told by sancho that
that wa don quixot she whip her palfrei the wellbeard barber
follow her and on come up to him her squir sprang from hi mule
and came forward to receiv her in hi arm and she dismount with
great eas of manner advanc to kneel befor the feet of don quixot
and though he strove to rais her up she without rise address him
in thi fashion
from thi spot i will not rise valiant and doughti knight until your
good and courtesi grant me a boon which will redound to the honour
and renown of your person and render a servic to the most disconsol
and afflict damsel the sun ha seen and if the might of your strong
arm correspond to the reput of your immort fame you ar bound to
aid the helpless be who led by the savour of your renown name
hath come from far distant land to seek your aid in her misfortun
i will not answer a word beauteou ladi repli don quixot nor
will i listen to anyth further concern you until you rise from
the earth
i will not rise seor answer the afflict damsel unless of
your courtesi the boon i ask is first grant me
i grant and accord it said don quixot provid without detriment
or prejudic to my king my countri or her who hold the kei of my
heart and freedom it mai be compli with
it will not be to the detriment or prejudic of ani of them my worthi
lord said the afflict damsel and here sancho panza drew close to
hi master ear and said to him veri softli your worship mai veri
safe grant the boon she ask it noth at all onli to kill a big
giant and she who ask it is the exalt princess micomicona queen of
the great kingdom of micomicon of ethiopia
let her be who she mai repli don quixot i will do what is my
bounden duti and what my conscienc bid me in conform with what i
have profess and turn to the damsel he said let your great
beauti rise for i grant the boon which you would ask of me
then what i ask said the damsel is that your magnanim person
accompani me at onc whither i will conduct you and that you promis
not to engag in ani other adventur or quest until you have aveng me
of a traitor who against all human and divin law ha usurp my
kingdom
i repeat that i grant it repli don quixot and so ladi you mai
from thi dai forth lai asid the melancholi that distress you and
let your fail hope gather new life and strength for with the help
of god and of my arm you will soon see yourself restor to your
kingdom and seat upon the throne of your ancient and mighti realm
notwithstand and despit of the felon who would gainsai it and now
hand to the work for in delai there is apt to be danger
the distress damsel strove with much pertinac to kiss hi hand
but don quixot who wa in all thing a polish and courteou knight
would by no mean allow it but made her rise and embrac her with
great courtesi and polit and order sancho to look to
rocinant girth and to arm him without a moment delai sancho
took down the armour which wa hung up on a tree like a trophi and
have seen to the girth arm hi master in a trice who as soon as
he found himself in hi armour exclaim
let us be gone in the name of god to bring aid to thi great ladi
the barber wa all thi time on hi knee at great pain to hide hi
laughter and not let hi beard fall for had it fallen mayb their fine
scheme would have come to noth but now see the boon grant and
the promptitud with which don quixot prepar to set out in
complianc with it he rose and took hi ladi hand and between them
thei place her upon the mule don quixot then mount rocinant and
the barber settl himself on hi beast sancho be left to go on
foot which made him feel anew the loss of hi dappl find the want
of him now but he bore all with cheer be persuad that hi
master had now fairli start and wa just on the point of becom an
emperor for he felt no doubt at all that he would marri thi princess
and be king of micomicon at least the onli thing that troubl him wa
the reflect that thi kingdom wa in the land of the black and
that the peopl thei would give him for vassal would be all black but
for thi he soon found a remedi in hi fanci and said he to himself
what is it to me if my vassal ar black what more have i to do than
make a cargo of them and carri them to spain where i can sell them and
get readi monei for them and with it bui some titl or some offic in
which to live at eas all the dai of my life not unless you go to
sleep and havent the wit or skill to turn thing to account and sell
three six or ten thousand vassal while you would be talk about
it by god i will stir them up big and littl or as best i can and
let them be ever so black ill turn them into white or yellow come
come what a fool i am and so he jog on so occupi with hi
thought and easi in hi mind that he forgot all about the hardship of
travel on foot
cardenio and the curat were watch all thi from among some bush
not know how to join compani with the other but the curat who
wa veri fertil in devic soon hit upon a wai of effect their
purpos and with a pair of scissor he had in a case he quickli cut
off cardenio beard and put on him a grei jerkin of hi own he
gave him a black cloak leav himself in hi breech and doublet
while cardenio appear wa so differ from what it had been that
he would not have known himself had he seen himself in a mirror have
effect thi although the other had gone on ahead while thei were
disguis themselv thei easili came out on the high road befor
them for the brambl and awkward place thei encount did not
allow those on horseback to go as fast as those on foot thei then
post themselv on the level ground at the outlet of the sierra and
as soon as don quixot and hi companion emerg from it the curat
began to examin him veri deliber as though he were strive to
recognis him and after have stare at him for some time he hasten
toward him with open arm exclaim a happi meet with the mirror
of chivalri my worthi compatriot don quixot of la mancha the flower
and cream of high breed the protect and relief of the
distress the quintess of knightserr and so sai he
clasp in hi arm the knee of don quixot left leg he astonish
at the stranger word and behaviour look at him attent and
at length recognis him veri much surpris to see him there and
made great effort to dismount thi howev the curat would not
allow on which don quixot said permit me seor licenti for it
is not fit that i should be on horseback and so reverend a person
as your worship on foot
on no account will i allow it said the curat your mighti must
remain on horseback for it is on horseback you achiev the greatest
deed and adventur that have been beheld in our ag as for me an
unworthi priest it will serv me well enough to mount on the haunch
of on of the mule of these gentlefolk who accompani your worship if
thei have no object and i will fanci i am mount on the steed
pegasu or on the zebra or charger that bore the famou moor
muzaraqu who to thi dai li enchant in the great hill of zulema
a littl distanc from the great complutum
nor even that will i consent to seor licenti answer don
quixot and i know it will be the good pleasur of my ladi the
princess out of love for me to order her squir to give up the saddl
of hi mule to your worship and he can sit behind if the beast will
bear it
it will i am sure said the princess and i am sure too that i
need not order my squir for he is too courteou and consider to
allow a churchman to go on foot when he might be mount
that he is said the barber and at onc alight he offer hi
saddl to the curat who accept it without much entreati but
unfortun as the barber wa mount behind the mule be as it
happen a hire on which is the same thing as sai
illcondit lift it hind hoof and let fly a coupl of kick in
the air which would have made master nichola wish hi expedit in
quest of don quixot at the devil had thei caught him on the breast or
head as it wa thei so took him by surpris that he came to the
ground give so littl heed to hi beard that it fell off and all he
could do when he found himself without it wa to cover hi face hastili
with both hi hand and moan that hi teeth were knock out don
quixot when he saw all that bundl of beard detach without jaw or
blood from the face of the fallen squir exclaim
by the live god but thi is a great miracl it ha knock off and
pluck awai the beard from hi face as if it had been shave off
designedli
the curat see the danger of discoveri that threaten hi scheme
at onc pounc upon the beard and hasten with it to where master
nichola lai still utter moan and draw hi head to hi breast
had it on in an instant mutter over him some word which he said
were a certain special charm for stick on beard as thei would see
and as soon as he had it fix he left him and the squir appear
well beard and whole as befor whereat don quixot wa beyond
measur astonish and beg the curat to teach him that charm when
he had an opportun as he wa persuad it virtu must extend
beyond the stick on of beard for it wa clear that where the beard
had been strip off the flesh must have remain torn and lacer
and when it could heal all that it must be good for more than beard
and so it is said the curat and he promis to teach it to him on
the first opportun thei then agre that for the present the curat
should mount and that the three should ride by turn until thei
reach the inn which might be about six leagu from where thei were
three then be mount that is to sai don quixot the princess
and the curat and three on foot cardenio the barber and sancho
panza don quixot said to the damsel

nevertheless i am here to behold what i so long for and that is my
lord don quixot of la mancha whose fame came to my ear as soon as i
set foot in spain and impel me to go in search of him to commend
myself to hi courtesi and entrust the justic of my caus to the
might of hi invinc arm
enough no more prais said don quixot at thi for i hate all

offens to my chast ear i will onli sai seora that whether it
ha might or not that which it mai or mai not have shall be devot to
your servic even to death and now leav thi to it proper season
i would ask the seor licenti to tell me what it is that ha brought
him into these part alon unattend and so lightli clad that i am
fill with amaz
i will answer that briefli repli the curat you must know then
seor don quixot that master nichola our friend and barber and i
were go to sevil to receiv some monei that a rel of mine who
went to the indi mani year ago had sent me and not such a small sum
but that it wa over sixti thousand piec of eight full weight which
is someth and pass by thi place yesterdai we were attack by
four footpad who strip us even to our beard and them thei
strip off so that the barber found it necessari to put on a fals
on and even thi young man herepoint to cardeniothei
complet transform but the best of it is the stori goe in the
neighbourhood that those who attack us belong to a number of gallei
slave who thei sai were set free almost on the veri same spot by a
man of such valour that in spite of the commissari and of the guard
he releas the whole of them and beyond all doubt he must have been
out of hi sens or he must be as great a scoundrel as thei or some
man without heart or conscienc to let the wolf loos among the sheep
the fox among the hen the fly among the honei he ha defraud
justic and oppos hi king and law master for he oppos hi
just command he ha i sai rob the gallei of their feet stir
up the holi brotherhood which for mani year past ha been quiet and
lastli ha done a deed by which hi soul mai be lost without ani gain
to hi bodi sancho had told the curat and the barber of the
adventur of the gallei slave which so much to hi glori hi master
had achiev and henc the curat in allud to it made the most of
it to see what would be said or done by don quixot who chang colour
at everi word not dare to sai that it wa he who had been the
liber of those worthi peopl these then said the curat were

the curat had hardli ceas speak when sancho said in faith
then seor licenti he who did that deed wa my master and it wa
not for want of my tell him beforehand and warn him to mind what
he wa about and that it wa a sin to set them at liberti as thei
were all on the march there becaus thei were special scoundrel
blockhead said don quixot at thi it is no busi or concern of
knightserr to inquir whether ani person in afflict in chain
or oppress that thei mai meet on the high road go that wai and
suffer as thei do becaus of their fault or becaus of their
misfortun it onli concern them to aid them as person in need of
help have regard to their suffer and not to their rascal i
encount a chaplet or string of miser and unfortun peopl
and did for them what my sens of duti demand of me and as for the
rest be that as it mai and whoever take object to it save the
sacr digniti of the seor licenti and hi honour person i sai
he know littl about chivalri and li like a whoreson villain and
thi i will give him to know to the fullest extent with my sword and
so sai he settl himself in hi stirrup and press down hi
morion for the barber basin which accord to him wa mambrino
helmet he carri hang at the saddlebow until he could repair the
damag done to it by the gallei slave
dorothea who wa shrewd and sprightli and by thi time thoroughli
understood don quixot crazi turn and that all except sancho panza
were make game of him not to be behind the rest said to him on
observ hi irrit sir knight rememb the boon you have
promis me and that in accord with it you must not engag in ani
other adventur be it ever so press calm yourself for if the
licenti had known that the gallei slave had been set free by that
unconqu arm he would have stop hi mouth thrice over or even
bitten hi tongu three time befor he would have said a word that
tend toward disrespect of your worship
that i swear heartili said the curat and i would have even
pluck off a moustach
i will hold my peac seora said don quixot and i will curb the
natur anger that had arisen in my breast and will proce in peac
and quiet until i have fulfil my promis but in return for thi
consider i entreat you to tell me if you have no object to do
so what is the natur of your troubl and how mani who and what ar
the person of whom i am to requir due satisfact and on whom i am
to take vengeanc on your behalf
that i will do with all my heart repli dorothea if it will not
be wearisom to you to hear of miseri and misfortun
it will not be wearisom seora said don quixot to which dorothea
repli well if that be so give me your attent as soon as she
said thi cardenio and the barber drew close to her side eager to
hear what sort of stori the quickwit dorothea would invent for
herself and sancho did the same for he wa as much taken in by her as
hi master and she have settl herself comfort in the saddl
and with the help of cough and other preliminari taken time to
think began with great sprightli of manner in thi fashion
first of all i would have you know sir that my name is and here
she stop for a moment for she forgot the name the curat had given
her but he came to her relief see what her difficulti wa and
said it is no wonder seora that your high should be confus
and embarrass in tell the tale of your misfortun for such
afflict often have the effect of depriv the suffer of memori
so that thei do not even rememb their own name as is the case now
with your ladyship who ha forgotten that she is call the princess
micomicona law heiress of the great kingdom of micomicon and with
thi cue your high mai now recal to your sorrow recollect
all you mai wish to tell us
that is the truth said the damsel but i think from thi on i shall
have no need of ani prompt and i shall bring my true stori safe
into port and here it is the king my father who wa call tinacrio
the sapient wa veri learn in what thei call magic art and becam
awar by hi craft that my mother who wa call queen jaramilla wa
to die befor he did and that soon after he too wa to depart thi
life and i wa to be left an orphan without father or mother but all
thi he declar did not so much griev or distress him as hi
certain knowledg that a prodigi giant the lord of a great island
close to our kingdom pandafilando of the scowl by namefor it is
aver that though hi ey ar properli place and straight he
alwai look askew as if he squint and thi he doe out of
malign to strike fear and terror into those he look atthat he
knew i sai that thi giant on becom awar of my orphan condit
would overrun my kingdom with a mighti forc and strip me of all not
leav me even a small villag to shelter me but that i could avoid
all thi ruin and misfortun if i were will to marri him howev
as far as he could see he never expect that i would consent to a
marriag so unequ and he said no more than the truth in thi for it
ha never enter my mind to marri that giant or ani other let him be
ever so great or enorm my father said too that when he wa dead
and i saw pandafilando about to invad my kingdom i wa not to wait
and attempt to defend myself for that would be destruct to me but
that i should leav the kingdom entir open to him if i wish to
avoid the death and total destruct of my good and loyal vassal for
there would be no possibl of defend myself against the giant
devilish power and that i should at onc with some of my follow set
out for spain where i should obtain relief in my distress on find a
certain knighterr whose fame by that time would extend over the
whole kingdom and who would be call if i rememb rightli don
azot or don gigot
don quixot he must have said seora observ sancho at thi
otherwis call the knight of the rueful counten
that is it said dorothea he said moreov that he would be tall
of statur and lank featur and that on hi right side under the left
shoulder or thereabout he would have a grei mole with hair like
bristl
on hear thi don quixot said to hi squir here sancho my son
bear a hand and help me to strip for i want to see if i am the knight
that sage king foretold
what doe your worship want to strip for said dorothea
to see if i have that mole your father spoke of answer don
quixot
there is no occas to strip said sancho for i know your worship
ha just such a mole on the middl of your backbon which is the mark
of a strong man
that is enough said dorothea for with friend we must not look too
close into trifl and whether it be on the shoulder or on the
backbon matter littl it is enough if there is a mole be it where
it mai for it is all the same flesh no doubt my good father hit the
truth in everi particular and i have made a lucki hit in commend
myself to don quixot for he is the on my father spoke of as the
featur of hi counten correspond with those assign to thi
knight by that wide fame he ha acquir not onli in spain but in all
la mancha for i had scarc land at osuna when i heard such
account of hi achiev that at onc my heart told me he wa the
veri on i had come in search of
but how did you land at osuna seora ask don quixot when it is
not a seaport
but befor dorothea could repli the curat anticip her sai
the princess meant to sai that after she had land at malaga the
first place where she heard of your worship wa osuna
that is what i meant to sai said dorothea
and that would be onli natur said the curat will your majesti
pleas proce
there is no more to add said dorothea save that in find don
quixot i have had such good fortun that i alreadi reckon and regard
myself queen and mistress of my entir dominion sinc of hi courtesi
and magnanim he ha grant me the boon of accompani me
whithersoev i mai conduct him which will be onli to bring him face
to face with pandafilando of the scowl that he mai slai him and
restor to me what ha been unjustli usurp by him for all thi must
come to pass satisfactorili sinc my good father tinacrio the sapient
foretold it who likewis left it declar in write in chalde or
greek charact for i cannot read them that if thi predict
knight after have cut the giant throat should be dispos to
marri me i wa to offer myself at onc without demur as hi law
wife and yield him possess of my kingdom togeth with my person
what thinkest thou now friend sancho said don quixot at thi
hearest thou that did i not tell thee so see how we have alreadi got
a kingdom to govern and a queen to marri
on my oath it is so said sancho and foul fortun to him who wont
marri after slit seor pandahilado windpip and then how
illfavour the queen is i wish the flea in my bed were that sort
and so sai he cut a coupl of caper in the air with everi sign of
extrem satisfact and then ran to seiz the bridl of dorothea
mule and check it fell on hi knee befor her beg her to give
him her hand to kiss in token of hi acknowledg of her as hi queen
and mistress which of the bystand could have help laugh to see
the mad of the master and the simplic of the servant dorothea
therefor gave her hand and promis to make him a great lord in her
kingdom when heaven should be so good as to permit her to recov and
enjoi it for which sancho return thank in word that set them all
laugh again
thi sir continu dorothea is my stori it onli remain to tell
you that of all the attend i took with me from my kingdom i have
none left except thi wellbeard squir for all were drown in a
great tempest we encount when in sight of port and he and i came
to land on a coupl of plank as if by a miracl and inde the whole
cours of my life is a miracl and a mysteri as you mai have observ
and if i have been over minut in ani respect or not as precis as i
ought let it be account for by what the licenti said at the
begin of my tale that constant and excess troubl depriv the
suffer of their memori
thei shall not depriv me of mine exalt and worthi princess said
don quixot howev great and unexampl those which i shall endur
in your servic mai be and here i confirm anew the boon i have
promis you and i swear to go with you to the end of the world until
i find myself in the presenc of your fierc enemi whose haughti head
i trust by the aid of my arm to cut off with the edg of thisi will
not sai good sword thank to gine de pasamont who carri awai
minethi he said between hi teeth and then continu and when
it ha been cut off and you have been put in peac possess of
your realm it shall be left to your own decis to dispos of your
person as mai be most pleas to you for so long as my memori is
occupi my will enslav and my understand enthral by heri
sai no moreit is imposs for me for a moment to contempl
marriag even with a phnix
the last word of hi master about not want to marri were so
disagre to sancho that rais hi voic he exclaim with great
irrit
by my oath seor don quixot you ar not in your right sens for
how can your worship possibl object to marri such an exalt
princess as thi do you think fortun will offer you behind everi
stone such a piec of luck as is offer you now is my ladi dulcinea
fairer perchanc not she nor half as fair and i will even go so far
as to sai she doe not come up to the shoe of thi on here a poor
chanc i have of get that counti i am wait for if your worship
goe look for dainti in the bottom of the sea in the devil
name marri marri and take thi kingdom that come to hand without
ani troubl and when you ar king make me a marqui or governor of a
provinc and for the rest let the devil take it all
don quixot when he heard such blasphemi utter against hi ladi
dulcinea could not endur it and lift hi pike without sai
anyth to sancho or utter a word he gave him two such thwack
that he brought him to the ground and had it not been that dorothea
cri out to him to spare him he would have no doubt taken hi life on
the spot
do you think he said to him after a paus you scurvi clown that
you ar to be alwai interf with me and that you ar to be alwai
offend and i alwai pardon dont fanci it impiou scoundrel
for that beyond a doubt thou art sinc thou hast set thy tongu go
against the peerless dulcinea know you not lout vagabond beggar
that were it not for the might that she infus into my arm i should
not have strength enough to kill a flea sai scoffer with a viper
tongu what think you ha won thi kingdom and cut off thi giant
head and made you a marqui for all thi i count as alreadi
accomplish and decid but the might of dulcinea emploi my arm
as the instrument of her achiev she fight in me and conquer in
me and i live and breath in her and ow my life and be to her o
whoreson scoundrel how ungrat you ar you see yourself rais
from the dust of the earth to be a titl lord and the return you make
for so great a benefit is to speak evil of her who ha confer it
upon you
sancho wa not so stun but that he heard all hi master said and
rise with some degre of nimbl he ran to place himself behind
dorothea palfrei and from that posit he said to hi master
tell me seor if your worship is resolv not to marri thi great
princess it is plain the kingdom will not be your and not be so
how can you bestow favour upon me that is what i complain of let
your worship at ani rate marri thi queen now that we have got her
here as if shower down from heaven and afterward you mai go back to
my ladi dulcinea for there must have been king in the world who kept
mistress as to beauti i have noth to do with it and if the
truth is to be told i like them both though i have never seen the
ladi dulcinea
how never seen her blasphem traitor exclaim don quixot
hast thou not just now brought me a messag from her
i mean said sancho that i did not see her so much at my leisur
that i could take particular notic of her beauti or of her charm
piecem but taken in the lump i like her
now i forgiv thee said don quixot and do thou forgiv me the
injuri i have done thee for our first impuls ar not in our
control
that i see repli sancho and with me the wish to speak is alwai
the first impuls and i cannot help sai onc at ani rate what i
have on the tip of my tongu
for all that sancho said don quixot take heed of what thou
sayest for the pitcher goe so often to the welli need sai no more to
thee
well well said sancho god is in heaven and see all trick and
will judg who doe most harm i in not speak right or your worship
in not do it
that is enough said dorothea run sancho and kiss your lord
hand and beg hi pardon and henceforward be more circumspect with your
prais and abus and sai noth in disparag of that ladi toboso
of whom i know noth save that i am her servant and put your trust
in god for you will not fail to obtain some digniti so as to live like
a princ
sancho advanc hang hi head and beg hi master hand which
don quixot with digniti present to him give him hi bless as
soon as he had kiss it he then bade him go on ahead a littl as he
had question to ask him and matter of great import to discuss
with him sancho obei and when the two had gone some distanc in
advanc don quixot said to him sinc thy return i have had no
opportun or time to ask thee mani particular touch thy mission
and the answer thou hast brought back and now that chanc ha grant
us the time and opportun deni me not the happi thou canst give
me by such good new
let your worship ask what you will answer sancho for i shall
find a wai out of all as i found a wai in but i implor you seor
not to be so reveng in futur
why dost thou sai that sancho said don quixot
i sai it he return becaus those blow just now were more
becaus of the quarrel the devil stir up between us both the other
night than for what i said against my ladi dulcinea whom i love and
rever as i would a relicthough there is noth of that about
hermer as someth belong to your worship
sai no more on that subject for thy life sancho said don quixot
for it is displeas to me i have alreadi pardon thee for that
and thou knowest the common sai for a fresh sin a fresh penanc
while thi wa go on thei saw come along the road thei were
follow a man mount on an ass who when he came close seem to be
a gipsi but sancho panza whose ey and heart were there wherev he
saw ass no sooner beheld the man than he knew him to be gine de
pasamont and by the thread of the gipsi he got at the ball hi ass
for it wa in fact dappl that carri pasamont who to escap
recognit and to sell the ass had disguis himself as a gipsi be
abl to speak the gipsi languag and mani more as well as if thei
were hi own sancho saw him and recognis him and the instant he did
so he shout to him ginesillo you thief give up my treasur
releas my life embarrass thyself not with my repos quit my ass
leav my delight be off rip get thee gone thief and give up what
is not thine
there wa no necess for so mani word or objurg for at the
first on gine jump down and at a like race speed made off and
got clear of them all sancho hasten to hi dappl and embrac him
he said how hast thou fare my bless dappl of my ey my
comrad all the while kiss him and caress him as if he were a
human be the ass held hi peac and let himself be kiss and
caress by sancho without answer a singl word thei all came up
and congratul him on have found dappl don quixot especi
who told him that notwithstand thi he would not cancel the order
for the three asscolt for which sancho thank him
while the two had been go along convers in thi fashion the
curat observ to dorothea that she had shown great clever as
well in the stori itself as in it concis and the resembl it
bore to those of the book of chivalri she said that she had mani
time amus herself read them but that she did not know the
situat of the provinc or seaport and so she had said at
haphazard that she had land at osuna
so i saw said the curat and for that reason i made hast to sai
what i did by which it wa all set right but is it not a strang
thing to see how readili thi unhappi gentleman believ all these
figment and li simpli becaus thei ar in the style and manner of
the absurd of hi book
so it is said cardenio and so uncommon and unexampl that were
on to attempt to invent and concoct it in fiction i doubt if there be
ani wit keen enough to imagin it
but anoth strang thing about it said the curat is that apart
from the silli thing which thi worthi gentleman sai in connect
with hi craze when other subject ar dealt with he can discuss them
in a perfectli ration manner show that hi mind is quit clear
and compos so that provid hi chivalri is not touch upon no
on would take him to be anyth but a man of thoroughli sound
understand
while thei were hold thi convers don quixot continu hi
with sancho sai
friend panza let us forgiv and forget as to our quarrel and tell
me now dismiss anger and irrit where how and when didst
thou find dulcinea what wa she do what didst thou sai to her
what did she answer how did she look when she wa read my letter
who copi it out for thee and everyth in the matter that seem to
thee worth know ask and learn neither ad nor falsifi
to give me pleasur nor yet curtail lest you should depriv me of
it
seor repli sancho if the truth is to be told nobodi copi out
the letter for me for i carri no letter at all
it is as thou sayest said don quixot for the notebook in which i
wrote it i found in my own possess two dai after thy departur
which gave me veri great vexat as i knew not what thou wouldst do
on find thyself without ani letter and i made sure thou wouldst
return from the place where thou didst first miss it
so i should have done said sancho if i had not got it by heart
when your worship read it to me so that i repeat it to a sacristan
who copi it out for me from hear it so exactli that he said in
all the dai of hi life though he had read mani a letter of
excommun he had never seen or read so pretti a letter as that
and hast thou got it still in thy memori sancho said don quixot
no seor repli sancho for as soon as i had repeat it see
there wa no further us for it i set about forget it and if i
recollect ani of it it is that about scrub i mean to sai
sovereign ladi and the end your till death the knight of the
rueful counten and between these two i put into it more than

wheat in the yard of her hous
then depend upon it said don quixot the grain of that wheat were
pearl when touch by her hand and didst thou look friend wa it
white wheat or brown
it wa neither but red said sancho
then i promis thee said don quixot that winnow by her hand
beyond a doubt the bread it made wa of the whitest but go on when
thou gavest her my letter did she kiss it did she place it on her
head did she perform ani ceremoni befit it or what did she do
when i went to give it to her repli sancho she wa hard at it
swai from side to side with a lot of wheat she had in the siev and
she said to me lai the letter friend on the top of that sack for i
cannot read it until i have done sift all thi
discreet ladi said don quixot that wa in order to read it at her
leisur and enjoi it proce sancho while she wa engag in her
occup what convers did she hold with thee what did she ask about
me and what answer didst thou give make hast tell me all and let
not an atom be left behind in the inkbottl
she ask me noth said sancho but i told her how your worship
wa left do penanc in her servic nake from the waist up in
among these mountain like a savag sleep on the ground not eat
bread off a tablecloth nor comb your beard weep and curs your
fortun
in sai i curs my fortun thou saidst wrong said don quixot
for rather do i bless it and shall bless it all the dai of my life
for have made me worthi of aspir to love so lofti a ladi as
dulcinea del toboso
and so lofti she is said sancho that she overtop me by more than
a handsbreadth
what sancho said don quixot didst thou measur with her
i measur in thi wai said sancho go to help her to put a sack
of wheat on the back of an ass we came so close togeth that i could
see she stood more than a good palm over me
well said don quixot and doth she not of a truth accompani and
adorn thi great with a thousand million charm of mind but on
thing thou wilt not deni sancho when thou camest close to her didst
thou not perceiv a saban odour an aromat fragranc a i know not
what delici that i cannot find a name for i mean a redol an
exhal as if thou wert in the shop of some dainti glover
all i can sai is said sancho that i did perceiv a littl odour
someth goati it must have been that she wa all in a sweat with
hard work
it could not be that said don quixot but thou must have been
suffer from cold in the head or must have smelt thyself for i know
well what would be the scent of that rose among thorn that lili of
the field that dissolv amber
mayb so repli sancho there often come from myself that same
odour which then seem to me to come from her grace the ladi dulcinea
but that no wonder for on devil is like anoth
well then continu don quixot now she ha done sift the corn
and sent it to the mill what did she do when she read the letter
as for the letter said sancho she did not read it for she said
she could neither read nor write instead of that she tore it up into
small piec sai that she did not want to let anyon read it lest
her secret should becom known in the villag and that what i had
told her by word of mouth about the love your worship bore her and the
extraordinari penanc you were do for her sake wa enough and to
make an end of it she told me to tell your worship that she kiss
your hand and that she had a greater desir to see you than to write
to you and that therefor she entreat and command you on sight of
thi present to come out of these thicket and to have done with
carri on absurd and to set out at onc for el toboso unless
someth els of greater import should happen for she had a great
desir to see your worship she laugh greatli when i told her how
your worship wa call the knight of the rueful counten i ask
her if that biscayan the other dai had been there and she told me he
had and that he wa an honest fellow i ask her too about the gallei
slave but she said she had not seen ani as yet
so far all goe well said don quixot but tell me what jewel wa
it that she gave thee on take thy leav in return for thy tide of
me for it is a usual and ancient custom with knight and ladi errant
to give the squir damsel or dwarf who bring tide of their
ladi to the knight or of their knight to the ladi some rich
jewel as a guerdon for good new and acknowledg of the messag
that is veri like said sancho and a good custom it wa to my
mind but that must have been in dai gone by for now it would seem to
be the custom onli to give a piec of bread and chees becaus that
wa what my ladi dulcinea gave me over the top of the yardwal when i
took leav of her and more by token it wa sheepsmilk chees
she is gener in the extrem said don quixot and if she did not
give thee a jewel of gold no doubt it must have been becaus she had
not on to hand there to give thee but sleev ar good after easter
i shall see her and all shall be made right but knowest thou what
amaz me sancho it seem to me thou must have gone and come through
the air for thou hast taken but littl more than three dai to go to
el toboso and return though it is more than thirti leagu from here
to there from which i am inclin to think that the sage magician who
is my friend and watch over my interest for of necess there is
and must be on or els i should not be a right knighterr that
thi same i sai must have help thee to travel without thy
knowledg for some of these sage will catch up a knighterr
sleep in hi bed and without hi know how or in what wai it
happen he wake up the next dai more than a thousand leagu awai
from the place where he went to sleep and if it were not for thi
knightserr would not be abl to give aid to on anoth in peril
as thei do at everi turn for a knight mayb is fight in the
mountain of armenia with some dragon or fierc serpent or anoth
knight and get the worst of the battl and is at the point of death
but when he least look for it there appear over against him on a
cloud or chariot of fire anoth knight a friend of hi who just
befor had been in england and who take hi part and deliv him
from death and at night he find himself in hi own quarter sup
veri much to hi satisfact and yet from on place to the other will
have been two or three thousand leagu and all thi is done by the
craft and skill of the sage enchant who take care of those valiant
knight so that friend sancho i find no difficulti in believ that
thou mayest have gone from thi place to el toboso and return in such
a short time sinc as i have said some friendli sage must have
carri thee through the air without thee perceiv it
that must have been it said sancho for inde rocinant went like
a gipsi ass with quicksilv in hi ear
quicksilv said don quixot ay and what is more a legion of
devil folk that can travel and make other travel without be
weari exactli as the whim seiz them but put thi asid what
thinkest thou i ought to do about my ladi command to go and see her
for though i feel that i am bound to obei her mandat i feel too that
i am debar by the boon i have accord to the princess that
accompani us and the law of chivalri compel me to have regard for
my word in prefer to my inclin on the on hand the desir to
see my ladi pursu and harass me on the other my solemn promis and
the glori i shall win in thi enterpris urg and call me but what i
think i shall do is to travel with all speed and reach quickli the
place where thi giant is and on my arriv i shall cut off hi head
and establish the princess peacefulli in her realm and forthwith i
shall return to behold the light that lighten my sens to whom i
shall make such excus that she will be led to approv of my delai
for she will see that it entir tend to increas her glori and fame
for all that i have won am win or shall win by arm in thi life
come to me of the favour she extend to me and becaus i am her
ah what a sad state your worship brain ar in said sancho tell
me seor do you mean to travel all that wai for noth and to let
slip and lose so rich and great a match as thi where thei give as a
portion a kingdom that in sober truth i have heard sai is more than
twenti thousand leagu round about and abound with all thing
necessari to support human life and is bigger than portug and
castil put togeth peac for the love of god blush for what you
have said and take my advic and forgiv me and marri at onc in the
first villag where there is a curat if not here is our licenti
who will do the busi beautifulli rememb i am old enough to give
advic and thi i am give come pat to the purpos for a sparrow in
the hand is better than a vultur on the wing and he who ha the good
to hi hand and choos the bad that the good he complain of mai not
come to him
look here sancho said don quixot if thou art advis me to
marri in order that immedi on slai the giant i mai becom
king and be abl to confer favour on thee and give thee what i have
promis let me tell thee i shall be abl veri easili to satisfi thy
desir without marri for befor go into battl i will make it a
stipul that if i come out of it victori even i do not marri
thei shall give me a portion of the kingdom that i mai bestow it upon
whomsoev i choos and when thei give it to me upon whom wouldst thou
have me bestow it but upon thee
that is plain speak said sancho but let your worship take care
to choos it on the seacoast so that if i dont like the life i mai
be abl to ship off my black vassal and deal with them as i have said
dont mind go to see my ladi dulcinea now but go and kill thi
giant and let us finish off thi busi for by god it strike me it
will be on of great honour and great profit
i hold thou art in the right of it sancho said don quixot and i
will take thy advic as to accompani the princess befor go to
see dulcinea but i counsel thee not to sai anyth to anyon or to
those who ar with us about what we have consid and discuss for
as dulcinea is so decor that she doe not wish her thought to be
known it is not right that i or anyon for me should disclos them
well then if that be so said sancho how is it that your worship
make all those you overcom by your arm go to present themselv
befor my ladi dulcinea thi be the same thing as sign your name
to it that you love her and ar her lover and as those who go must
perforc kneel befor her and sai thei come from your worship to submit
themselv to her how can the thought of both of you be hid
o how silli and simpl thou art said don quixot seest thou not
sancho that thi tend to her greater exalt for thou must know
that accord to our wai of think in chivalri it is a high honour
to a ladi to have mani knightserr in her servic whose thought
never go beyond serv her for her own sake and who look for no other
reward for their great and true devot than that she should be
will to accept them as her knight
it is with that kind of love said sancho i have heard preacher
sai we ought to love our lord for himself alon without be move
by the hope of glori or the fear of punish though for my part i
would rather love and serv him for what he could do
the devil take thee for a clown said don quixot and what shrewd
thing thou sayest at time on would think thou hadst studi
in faith then i cannot even read
master nichola here call out to them to wait a while as thei want
to halt and drink at a littl spring there wa there don quixot drew
up not a littl to the satisfact of sancho for he wa by thi time
weari of tell so mani li and in dread of hi master catch him
trip for though he knew that dulcinea wa a peasant girl of el
toboso he had never seen her in all hi life cardenio had now put on
the cloth which dorothea wa wear when thei found her and though
thei were not veri good thei were far better than those he put off
thei dismount togeth by the side of the spring and with what the
curat had provid himself with at the inn thei appeas though not
veri well the keen appetit thei all of them brought with them
while thei were so emploi there happen to come by a youth pass
on hi wai who stop to examin the parti at the spring the next
moment ran to don quixot and clasp him round the leg began to
weep freeli sai o seor do you not know me look at me well i
am that lad andr that your worship releas from the oaktre where i
wa ti
don quixot recognis him and take hi hand he turn to those
present and said that your worship mai see how import it is to
have knightserr to redress the wrong and injuri done by
tyrann and wick men in thi world i mai tell you that some dai
ago pass through a wood i heard cri and piteou complaint as of
a person in pain and distress i immedi hasten impel by my
bounden duti to the quarter whenc the plaintiv accent seem to me
to proce and i found ti to an oak thi lad who now stand befor
you which in my heart i rejoic at for hi testimoni will not permit
me to depart from the truth in ani particular he wa i sai ti to
an oak nake from the waist up and a clown whom i afterward found
to be hi master wa scarifi him by lash with the rein of hi
mare as soon as i saw him i ask the reason of so cruel a
flagel the boor repli that he wa flog him becaus he wa
hi servant and becaus of careless that proceed rather from
dishonesti than stupid on which thi boi said seor he flog me
onli becaus i ask for my wage the master made i know not what
speech and explan which though i listen to them i did not
accept in short i compel the clown to unbind him and to swear he
would take him with him and pai him real by real and perfum into
the bargain is not all thi true andr my son didst thou not mark
with what author i command him and with what humil he promis
to do all i enjoin specifi and requir of him answer without
hesit tell these gentlemen what took place that thei mai see
that it is as great an advantag as i sai to have knightserr
abroad
all that your worship ha said is quit true answer the lad but
the end of the busi turn out just the opposit of what your
worship suppos
how the opposit said don quixot did not the clown pai thee
then
not onli did he not pai me repli the lad but as soon as your
worship had pass out of the wood and we were alon he ti me up
again to the same oak and gave me a fresh flog that left me like a
flai saint bartholomew and everi stroke he gave me he follow up
with some jest or gibe about have made a fool of your worship and
but for the pain i wa suffer i should have laugh at the thing he
said in short he left me in such a condit that i have been until
now in a hospit get cure of the injuri which that rascal
clown inflict on me then for all which your worship is to blame for
if you had gone your own wai and not come where there wa no call for
you nor meddl in other peopl affair my master would have been
content with give me on or two dozen lash and would have then
loos me and paid me what he ow me but when your worship abus him
so out of measur and gave him so mani hard word hi anger wa
kindl and as he could not reveng himself on you as soon as he saw
you had left him the storm burst upon me in such a wai that i feel as
if i should never be a man again
the mischief said don quixot lai in my go awai for i should
not have gone until i had seen thee paid becaus i ought to have known
well by long experi that there is no clown who will keep hi word
if he find it will not suit him to keep it but thou rememberest
andr that i swore if he did not pai thee i would go and seek him
and find him though he were to hide himself in the whale belli
that is true said andr but it wa of no us
thou shalt see now whether it is of us or not said don quixot and
so sai he got up hastili and bade sancho bridl rocinant who wa
brows while thei were eat dorothea ask him what he meant to
do he repli that he meant to go in search of thi clown and chastis
him for such iniquit conduct and see andr paid to the last
maravedi despit and in the teeth of all the clown in the world to
which she repli that he must rememb that in accord with hi
promis he could not engag in ani enterpris until he had conclud
her and that as he knew thi better than anyon he should restrain
hi ardour until hi return from her kingdom
that is true said don quixot and andr must have patienc until
my return as you sai seora but i onc more swear and promis not to
stop until i have seen him aveng and paid
i have no faith in those oath said andr i would rather have now
someth to help me to get to sevil than all the reveng in the
world if you have here anyth to eat that i can take with me give
it me and god be with your worship and all knightserr and mai
their errand turn out as well for themselv as thei have for me
sancho took out from hi store a piec of bread and anoth of chees
and give them to the lad he said here take thi brother andr
for we have all of us a share in your misfortun
why what share have you got
thi share of bread and chees i am give you answer sancho and
god know whether i shall feel the want of it myself or not for i
would have you know friend that we squir to knightserr have to
bear a great deal of hunger and hard fortun and even other thing
more easili felt than told
andr seiz hi bread and chees and see that nobodi gave him
anyth more bent hi head and took hold of the road as the sai
is howev befor leav he said for the love of god sir
knighterr if you ever meet me again though you mai see them
cut me to piec give me no aid or succour but leav me to my
misfortun which will not be so great but that a greater will come to
me by be help by your worship on whom and all the knightserr

don quixot wa get up to chastis him but he took to hi heel at
such a pace that no on attempt to follow him and mightili

rather not enter it there wa no help for it the landladi the
landlord their daughter and maritorn when thei saw don quixot and
sancho come went out to welcom them with sign of hearti
satisfact which don quixot receiv with digniti and graviti and
bade them make up a better bed for him than the last time to which the
landladi repli that if he paid better than he did the last time she
would give him on fit for a princ don quixot said he would so thei
made up a toler on for him in the same garret as befor and he
lai down at onc be sore shaken and in want of sleep
no sooner wa the door shut upon him than the landladi made at the
barber and seiz him by the beard said
by my faith you ar not go to make a beard of my tail ani longer
you must give me back my tail for it is a shame the wai that thing of
my husband goe toss about on the floor i mean the comb that i
us to stick in my good tail
but for all she tug at it the barber would not give it up until the
licenti told him to let her have it as there wa now no further
occas for that stratagem becaus he might declar himself and
appear in hi own charact and tell don quixot that he had fled to
thi inn when those thiev the gallei slave rob him and should he
ask for the princesss squir thei could tell him that she had sent
him on befor her to give notic to the peopl of her kingdom that she
wa come and bring with her the deliver of them all on thi
the barber cheerfulli restor the tail to the landladi and at the
same time thei return all the accessori thei had borrow to effect
don quixot deliver all the peopl of the inn were struck with
astonish at the beauti of dorothea and even at the come figur
of the shepherd cardenio the curat made them get readi such fare as
there wa in the inn and the landlord in hope of better payment
serv them up a toler good dinner all thi time don quixot wa
asleep and thei thought it best not to waken him as sleep would
now do him more good than eat
while at dinner the compani consist of the landlord hi wife
their daughter maritorn and all the travel thei discuss the
strang craze of don quixot and the manner in which he had been found
and the landladi told them what had taken place between him and the
carrier and then look round to see if sancho wa there when she
saw he wa not she gave them the whole stori of hi blanket which
thei receiv with no littl amus but on the curat observ
that it wa the book of chivalri which don quixot had read that had
turn hi brain the landlord said
i cannot understand how that can be for in truth to my mind there is
no better read in the world and i have here two or three of them
with other write that ar the veri life not onli of myself but of
plenti more for when it is harvesttim the reaper flock here on
holidai and there is alwai on among them who can read and who take
up on of these book and we gather round him thirti or more of us
and stai listen to him with a delight that make our grei hair grow
young again at least i can sai for myself that when i hear of what
furiou and terribl blow the knight deliv i am seiz with the
long to do the same and i would like to be hear about them night
and dai
and i just as much said the landladi becaus i never have a quiet
moment in my hous except when you ar listen to someon read
for then you ar so taken up that for the time be you forget to
scold
that is true said maritorn and faith i relish hear these
thing greatli too for thei ar veri pretti especi when thei
describ some ladi or anoth in the arm of her knight under the
orang tree and the duenna who is keep watch for them half dead
with envi and fright all thi i sai is as good as honei
and you what do you think young ladi said the curat turn to
the landlord daughter
i dont know inde seor said she i listen too and to tell the
truth though i do not understand it i like hear it but it is not
the blow that my father like that i like but the lament the knight
utter when thei ar separ from their ladi and inde thei
sometim make me weep with the piti i feel for them
then you would consol them if it wa for you thei wept young ladi
said dorothea
i dont know what i should do said the girl i onli know that there
ar some of those ladi so cruel that thei call their knight tiger
and lion and a thousand other foul name and jesu i dont know what
sort of folk thei can be so unfeel and heartless that rather than
bestow a glanc upon a worthi man thei leav him to die or go mad i
dont know what is the good of such pruderi if it is for honour
sake why not marri them that all thei want
hush child said the landladi it seem to me thou knowest a great
deal about these thing and it is not fit for girl to know or talk so
much
as the gentleman ask me i could not help answer him said the
girl
well then said the curat bring me these book seor landlord
for i should like to see them
with all my heart said he and go into hi own room he brought
out an old valis secur with a littl chain on open which the
curat found in it three larg book and some manuscript written in a
veri good hand the first that he open he found to be don cirongilio
of thrace and the second don felixmart of hircania and the other
the histori of the great captain gonzalo hernandez de cordova with
the life of diego garca de pared
when the curat read the two first titl he look over at the barber
and said we want my friend housekeep and niec here now
nai said the barber i can do just as well to carri them to the
yard or to the hearth and there is a veri good fire there
what your worship would burn my book said the landlord
onli these two said the curat don cirongilio and felixmart
ar my book then heret or phlegmat that you want to burn
them said the landlord
schismat you mean friend said the barber not phlegmat
that it said the landlord but if you want to burn ani let it be
that about the great captain and that diego garca for i would rather
have a child of mine burnt than either of the other
brother said the curat those two book ar made up of li and
ar full of folli and nonsens but thi of the great captain is a true
histori and contain the deed of gonzalo hernandez of cordova who by
hi mani and great achiev earn the titl all over the world of
the great captain a famou and illustri name and deserv by him
alon and thi diego garca de pared wa a distinguish knight of
the citi of trujillo in estremadura a most gallant soldier and of
such bodili strength that with on finger he stop a millwheel in
full motion and post with a twohand sword at the foot of a bridg
he kept the whole of an immens armi from pass over it and achiev
such other exploit that if instead of hi relat them himself with
the modesti of a knight and of on write hi own histori some free
and unbias writer had record them thei would have thrown into the
shade all the deed of the hector achilles and roland

tell that to my father said the landlord there a thing to be
astonish at stop a millwheel by god your worship should read
what i have read of felixmart of hircania how with on singl
backstrok he cleft five giant asund through the middl as if thei
had been made of beanpod like the littl friar the children make
and anoth time he attack a veri great and power armi in which
there were more than a million six hundr thousand soldier all arm
from head to foot and he rout them all as if thei had been flock of

and then what do you sai to the good cirongilio of thrace that wa
so stout and bold as mai be seen in the book where it is relat that
as he wa sail along a river there came up out of the midst of the
water against him a fieri serpent and he as soon as he saw it flung
himself upon it and got astrid of it scali shoulder and squeez
it throat with both hand with such forc that the serpent find he
wa throttl it had noth for it but to let itself sink to the
bottom of the river carri with it the knight who would not let go
hi hold and when thei got down there he found himself among palac
and garden so pretti that it wa a wonder to see and then the serpent
chang itself into an old ancient man who told him such thing as
were never heard hold your peac seor for if you were to hear thi
you would go mad with delight a coupl of fig for your great captain
and your diego garca
hear thi dorothea said in a whisper to cardenio our landlord is
almost fit to plai a second part to don quixot
i think so said cardenio for as he show he accept it as a
certainti that everyth those book relat took place exactli as it
is written down and the barefoot friar themselv would not
persuad him to the contrari
but consid brother said the curat onc more there never wa
ani felixmart of hircania in the world nor ani cirongilio of thrace
or ani of the other knight of the same sort that the book of
chivalri talk of the whole thing is the fabric and invent of
idl wit devis by them for the purpos you describ of beguil
the time as your reaper do when thei read for i swear to you in all
serious there never were ani such knight in the world and no such
exploit or nonsens ever happen anywher
try that bone on anoth dog said the landlord as if i did not
know how mani make five and where my shoe pinch me dont think to
feed me with pap for by god i am no fool it is a good joke for your
worship to try and persuad me that everyth these good book sai is
nonsens and li and thei print by the licens of the lord of the
royal council as if thei were peopl who would allow such a lot of
li to be print all togeth and so mani battl and enchant
that thei take awai on sens
i have told you friend said the curat that thi is done to
divert our idl thought and as in wellord state game of chess
five and billiard ar allow for the divers of those who do not
care or ar not oblig or ar unabl to work so book of thi kind
ar allow to be print on the supposit that what inde is the
truth there can be nobodi so ignor as to take ani of them for true
stori and if it were permit me now and the present compani
desir it i could sai someth about the qualiti book of chivalri
should possess to be good on that would be to the advantag and even
to the tast of some but i hope the time will come when i can
commun my idea to someon who mai be abl to mend matter and in
the meantim seor landlord believ what i have said and take your
book and make up your mind about their truth or falsehood and much
good mai thei do you and god grant you mai not fall lame of the same
foot your guest don quixot halt on
no fear of that return the landlord i shall not be so mad as to
make a knighterr of myself for i see well enough that thing ar
not now as thei us to be in those dai when thei sai those famou
knight roam about the world
sancho had made hi appear in the middl of thi convers and
he wa veri much troubl and cast down by what he heard said about
knightserr be now no longer in vogu and all book of chivalri
be folli and li and he resolv in hi heart to wait and see what
came of thi journei of hi master and if it did not turn out as
happili as hi master expect he determin to leav him and go back
to hi wife and children and hi ordinari labour
the landlord wa carri awai the valis and the book but the curat
said to him wait i want to see what those paper ar that ar
written in such a good hand the landlord take them out hand them
to him to read and he perceiv thei were a work of about eight sheet
of manuscript with in larg letter at the begin the titl of
novel of the illadvis curios the curat read three or four
line to himself and said i must sai the titl of thi novel doe
not seem to me a bad on and i feel an inclin to read it all to
which the landlord repli then your rever will do well to read
it for i can tell you that some guest who have read it here have been
much pleas with it and have beg it of me veri earnestli but i
would not give it mean to return it to the person who forgot the
valis book and paper here for mayb he will return here some time
or other and though i know i shall miss the book faith i mean to
return them for though i am an innkeep still i am a christian
you ar veri right friend said the curat but for all that if
the novel pleas me you must let me copi it
with all my heart repli the host
while thei were talk cardenio had taken up the novel and begun to
read it and form the same opinion of it as the curat he beg
him to read it so that thei might all hear it
i would read it said the curat if the time would not be better
spent in sleep
it will be rest enough for me said dorothea to while awai the time
by listen to some tale for my spirit ar not yet tranquil enough
to let me sleep when it would be season
well then in that case said the curat i will read it if it were
onli out of curios perhap it mai contain someth pleasant
master nichola ad hi entreati to the same effect and sancho
too see which and consid that he would give pleasur to all
and receiv it himself the curat said well then attend to me

young of the same ag and of the same tast which wa enough to
account for the reciproc friendship between them anselmo it is
true wa somewhat more inclin to seek pleasur in love than
lothario for whom the pleasur of the chase had more attract but
on occas anselmo would forego hi own tast to yield to those of
lothario and lothario would surrend hi to fall in with those of

he had been wont strive to do honour to him and to the occas and
to gratifi him in everi wai he could but when the wed dai were
over and the success of visit and congratul had slacken he
began purpos to leav off go to the hous of anselmo for it
seem to him as it natur would to all men of sens that friend
hous ought not to be visit after marriag with the same frequenc
as in their master bachelor dai becaus though true and genuin
friendship cannot and should not be in ani wai suspici still a
marri man honour is a thing of such delicaci that it is held liabl
to injuri from brother much more from friend anselmo remark the
cessat of lothario visit and complain of it to him sai
that if he had known that marriag wa to keep him from enjoi hi
societi as he us he would have never marri and that if by the
thorough harmoni that subsist between them while he wa a bachelor
thei had earn such a sweet name as that of the two friend he
should not allow a titl so rare and so delight to be lost through a
needless anxieti to act circumspectli and so he entreat him if such
a phrase wa allow between them to be onc more master of hi
hous and to come in and go out as formerli assur him that hi wife
camilla had no other desir or inclin than that which he would
wish her to have and that know how sincer thei love on anoth
she wa griev to see such cold in him
to all thi and much more that anselmo said to lothario to persuad him
to come to hi hous as he had been in the habit of do lothario
repli with so much prudenc sens and judgment that anselmo wa
satisfi of hi friend good intent and it wa agre that on
two dai in the week and on holidai lothario should come to dine
with him but though thi arrang wa made between them lothario
resolv to observ it no further than he consid to be in
accord with the honour of hi friend whose good name wa more to
him than hi own he said and justli that a marri man upon whom
heaven had bestow a beauti wife should consid as carefulli what
friend he brought to hi hous as what femal friend hi wife
associ with for what cannot be done or arrang in the
marketplac in church at public festiv or at station
opportun that husband cannot alwai deni their wive mai be
easili manag in the hous of the femal friend or rel in whom
most confid is repos lothario said too that everi marri man
should have some friend who would point out to him ani neglig he
might be guilti of in hi conduct for it will sometim happen that
ow to the deep affect the husband bear hi wife either he doe
not caution her or not to vex her refrain from tell her to do or
not to do certain thing do or avoid which mai be a matter of
honour or reproach to him and error of thi kind he could easili
correct if warn by a friend but where is such a friend to be found
as lothario would have so judici so loyal and so true
of a truth i know not lothario alon wa such a on for with the
utmost care and vigil he watch over the honour of hi friend and
strove to diminish cut down and reduc the number of dai for go
to hi hous accord to their agreement lest the visit of a young
man wealthi highborn and with the attract he wa consciou of
possess at the hous of a woman so beauti as camilla should be
regard with suspicion by the inquisit and malici ey of the
idl public for though hi integr and reput might bridl
slander tongu still he wa unwil to hazard either hi own
good name or that of hi friend and for thi reason most of the dai
agre upon he devot to some other busi which he pretend wa
unavoid so that a great portion of the dai wa taken up with
complaint on on side and excus on the other it happen howev
that on on occas when the two were stroll togeth outsid the
citi anselmo address the follow word to lothario
thou mayest suppos lothario my friend that i am unabl to give
suffici thank for the favour god ha render me in make me the
son of such parent as mine were and bestow upon me with no niggard
hand what ar call the gift of natur as well as those of fortun
and abov all for what he ha done in give me thee for a friend and
camilla for a wifetwo treasur that i valu if not as highli as i
ought at least as highli as i am abl and yet with all these good
thing which ar commonli all that men need to enabl them to live
happili i am the most discont and dissatisfi man in the whole
world for i know not how long sinc i have been harass and
oppress by a desir so strang and so unusu that i wonder at
myself and blame and chide myself when i am alon and strive to stifl
it and hide it from my own thought and with no better success than if
i were endeavour deliber to publish it to all the world and
as in short it must come out i would confid it to thy safe keep
feel sure that by thi mean and by thy readi as a true friend
to afford me relief i shall soon find myself freed from the distress
it caus me and that thy care will give me happi in the same
degre as my own folli ha caus me miseri
the word of anselmo struck lothario with astonish unabl as he
wa to conjectur the purport of such a lengthi preambl and though he
strove to imagin what desir it could be that so troubl hi friend
hi conjectur were all far from the truth and to reliev the anxieti
which thi perplex wa caus him he told him he wa do a
flagrant injustic to their great friendship in seek circuit
method of confid to him hi most hidden thought for he well knew
he might reckon upon hi counsel in divert them or hi help in
carri them into effect
that is the truth repli anselmo and reli upon that i will
tell thee friend lothario that the desir which harass me is that
of know whether my wife camilla is as good and as perfect as i think
her to be and i cannot satisfi myself of the truth on thi point
except by test her in such a wai that the trial mai prove the puriti
of her virtu as the fire prove that of gold becaus i am persuad
my friend that a woman is virtuou onli in proport as she is or is
not tempt and that she alon is strong who doe not yield to the
promis gift tear and importun of earnest lover for what
thank doe a woman deserv for be good if no on urg her to be
bad and what wonder is it that she is reserv and circumspect to whom
no opportun is given of go wrong and who know she ha a husband
that will take her life the first time he detect her in an
improprieti i do not therefor hold her who is virtuou through fear
or want of opportun in the same estim as her who come out of
temptat and trial with a crown of victori and so for these reason
and mani other that i could give thee to justifi and support the
opinion i hold i am desir that my wife camilla should pass thi
crisi and be refin and test by the fire of find herself woo
and by on worthi to set hi affect upon her and if she come out
as i know she will victori from thi struggl i shall look upon my
good fortun as unequal i shall be abl to sai that the cup of my
desir is full and that the virtuou woman of whom the sage sai who
shall find her ha fallen to my lot and if the result be the
contrari of what i expect in the satisfact of know that i have
been right in my opinion i shall bear without complaint the pain which
my so dearli bought experi will natur caus me and as noth
of all thou wilt urg in opposit to my wish will avail to keep me
from carri it into effect it is my desir friend lothario that
thou shouldst consent to becom the instrument for effect thi
purpos that i am bent upon for i will afford thee opportun to
that end and noth shall be want that i mai think necessari for
the pursuit of a virtuou honour modest and highmind woman
and among other reason i am induc to entrust thi arduou task to
thee by the consider that if camilla be conquer by thee the
conquest will not be push to extrem but onli far enough to account
that accomplish which from a sens of honour will be left undon
thu i shall not be wrong in anyth more than intent and my
wrong will remain buri in the integr of thy silenc which i know
well will be as last as that of death in what concern me if
therefor thou wouldst have me enjoi what can be call life thou
wilt at onc engag in thi love struggl not lukewarmli nor
slothfulli but with the energi and zeal that my desir demand and
with the loyalti our friendship assur me of
such were the word anselmo address to lothario who listen to them
with such attent that except to sai what ha been alreadi
mention he did not open hi lip until the other had finish then
perceiv that he had no more to sai after regard him for a while
as on would regard someth never befor seen that excit wonder and
amaz he said to him i cannot persuad myself anselmo my
friend that what thou hast said to me is not in jest if i thought
that thou wert speak serious i would not have allow thee to go
so far so as to put a stop to thy long harangu by not listen to
thee i verili suspect that either thou dost not know me or i do not
know thee but no i know well thou art anselmo and thou knowest that
i am lothario the misfortun is it seem to me that thou art not the
anselmo thou wert and must have thought that i am not the lothario i
should be for the thing that thou hast said to me ar not those of
that anselmo who wa my friend nor ar those that thou demandest of me
what should be ask of the lothario thou knowest true friend will
prove their friend and make us of them as a poet ha said usqu ad
ara wherebi he meant that thei will not make us of their friendship
in thing that ar contrari to god will if thi then wa a
heathen feel about friendship how much more should it be a
christian who know that the divin must not be forfeit for the
sake of ani human friendship and if a friend should go so far as to
put asid hi duti to heaven to fulfil hi duti to hi friend it
should not be in matter that ar trifl or of littl moment but in
such as affect the friend life and honour now tell me anselmo in
which of these two art thou imperil that i should hazard myself to
gratifi thee and do a thing so detest as that thou seekest of me
neither forsooth on the contrari thou dost ask of me so far as i
understand to strive and labour to rob thee of honour and life and to
rob myself of them at the same time for if i take awai thy honour it
is plain i take awai thy life as a man without honour is wors than
dead and be the instrument as thou wilt have it so of so much
wrong to thee shall not i too be left without honour and
consequ without life listen to me anselmo my friend and be not
impati to answer me until i have said what occur to me touch the
object of thy desir for there will be time enough left for thee to
repli and for me to hear
be it so said anselmo sai what thou wilt
lothario then went on to sai it seem to me anselmo that thine is
just now the temper of mind which is alwai that of the moor who can
never be brought to see the error of their creed by quotat from the
holi scriptur or by reason which depend upon the examin of the
understand or ar found upon the articl of faith but must have
exampl that ar palpabl easi intellig capabl of proof not
admit of doubt with mathemat demonstr that cannot be
deni like if equal be taken from equal the remaind ar
equal and if thei do not understand thi in word and inde thei
do not it ha to be shown to them with the hand and put befor their
ey and even with all thi no on succe in convinc them of the
truth of our holi religion thi same mode of proceed i shall have
to adopt with thee for the desir which ha sprung up in thee is so
absurd and remot from everyth that ha a semblanc of reason that
i feel it would be a wast of time to emploi it in reason with thy
simplic for at present i will call it by no other name and i am
even tempt to leav thee in thy folli as a punish for thy
pernici desir but the friendship i bear thee which will not allow
me to desert thee in such manifest danger of destruct keep me from
deal so harshli by thee and that thou mayest clearli see thi sai
anselmo hast thou not told me that i must forc my suit upon a modest
woman decoi on that is virtuou make overtur to on that is
puremind pai court to on that is prudent ye thou hast told me
so then if thou knowest that thou hast a wife modest virtuou
puremind and prudent what is it that thou seekest and if thou
believest that she will come forth victori from all my attacksa
doubtless she wouldwhat higher titl than those she possess now
dost thou think thou canst bestow upon her then or in what will she be
better then than she is now either thou dost not hold her to be what
thou sayest or thou knowest not what thou dost demand if thou dost
not hold her to be what thou sayest why dost thou seek to prove her
instead of treat her as guilti in the wai that mai seem best to
thee but if she be as virtuou as thou believest it is an
uncalledfor proceed to make trial of truth itself for after
trial it will but be in the same estim as befor thu then it
is conclus that to attempt thing from which harm rather than
advantag mai come to us is the part of unreason and reckless mind
more especi when thei ar thing which we ar not forc or
compel to attempt and which show from afar that it is plainli
mad to attempt them
difficulti ar attempt either for the sake of god or for the sake
of the world or for both those undertaken for god sake ar those
which the saint undertak when thei attempt to live the live of
angel in human bodi those undertaken for the sake of the world ar
those of the men who travers such a vast expans of water such a
varieti of climat so mani strang countri to acquir what ar
call the bless of fortun and those undertaken for the sake of
god and the world togeth ar those of brave soldier who no sooner
do thei see in the enemi wall a breach as wide as a cannon ball could
make than cast asid all fear without hesit or heed the
manifest peril that threaten them born onward by the desir of
defend their faith their countri and their king thei fling
themselv dauntlessli into the midst of the thousand oppos death
that await them such ar the thing that men ar wont to attempt and
there is honour glori gain in attempt them howev full of
difficulti and peril thei mai be but that which thou sayest it is thy
wish to attempt and carri out will not win thee the glori of god nor
the bless of fortun nor fame among men for even if the issu be
as thou wouldst have it thou wilt be no happier richer or more
honour than thou art thi moment and if it be otherwis thou wilt be
reduc to miseri greater than can be imagin for then it will avail
thee noth to reflect that no on is awar of the misfortun that ha
befallen thee it will suffic to tortur and crush thee that thou
knowest it thyself and in confirm of the truth of what i sai let
me repeat to thee a stanza made by the famou poet luigi tansillo at
the end of the first part of hi tear of saint peter which sai
thu
the anguish and the shame but greater grew
in peter heart as morn slowli came
no ey wa there to see him well he knew
yet he himself wa to himself a shame
expos to all men gaze or screen from view
a nobl heart will feel the pang the same
a prei to shame the sin soul will be
though none but heaven and earth it shame can see
thu by keep it secret thou wilt not escap thy sorrow but rather
thou wilt shed tear unceasingli if not tear of the ey tear of
blood from the heart like those shed by that simpl doctor our poet
tell us of that tri the test of the cup which the wise rinaldo
better advis refus to do for though thi mai be a poetic fiction
it contain a moral lesson worthi of attent and studi and imit
moreov by what i am about to sai to thee thou wilt be led to see the
great error thou wouldst commit
tell me anselmo if heaven or good fortun had made thee master and
law owner of a diamond of the finest qualiti with the excel
and puriti of which all the lapidari that had seen it had been
satisfi sai with on voic and common consent that in puriti
qualiti and fine it wa all that a stone of the kind could
possibl be thou thyself too be of the same belief as know
noth to the contrari would it be reason in thee to desir to
take that diamond and place it between an anvil and a hammer and by
mere forc of blow and strength of arm try if it were as hard and as
fine as thei said and if thou didst and if the stone should resist so
silli a test that would add noth to it valu or reput and if
it were broken as it might be would not all be lost undoubtedli it
would leav it owner to be rate as a fool in the opinion of all
consid then anselmo my friend that camilla is a diamond of the
finest qualiti as well in thy estim as in that of other and that
it is contrari to reason to expos her to the risk of be broken for
if she remain intact she cannot rise to a higher valu than she now
possess and if she give wai and be unabl to resist bethink thee
now how thou wilt be depriv of her and with what good reason thou
wilt complain of thyself for have been the caus of her ruin and
thine own rememb there is no jewel in the world so preciou as a
chast and virtuou woman and that the whole honour of women consist
in reput and sinc thy wife is of that high excel that
thou knowest wherefor shouldst thou seek to call that truth in
question rememb my friend that woman is an imperfect anim and
that impedi ar not to be place in her wai to make her trip and
fall but that thei should be remov and her path left clear of all
obstacl so that without hindranc she mai run her cours freeli to
attain the desir perfect which consist in be virtuou
naturalist tell us that the ermin is a littl anim which ha a fur
of purest white and that when the hunter wish to take it thei make
us of thi artific have ascertain the place which it frequent
and pass thei stop the wai to them with mud and then rous it
drive it toward the spot and as soon as the ermin come to the mud
it halt and allow itself to be taken captiv rather than pass
through the mire and spoil and sulli it white which it valu
more than life and liberti the virtuou and chast woman is an ermin
and whiter and purer than snow is the virtu of modesti and he who
wish her not to lose it but to keep and preserv it must adopt a
cours differ from that emploi with the ermin he must not put
befor her the mire of the gift and attent of persev lover
becaus perhapsand even without a perhapssh mai not have suffici
virtu and natur strength in herself to pass through and tread under
foot these impedi thei must be remov and the bright of
virtu and the beauti of a fair fame must be put befor her a virtuou
woman too is like a mirror of clear shine crystal liabl to be
tarnish and dim by everi breath that touch it she must be
treat as relic ar ador not touch she must be protect and
prize as on protect and prize a fair garden full of rose and
flower the owner of which allow no on to trespass or pluck a
blossom enough for other that from afar and through the iron grate
thei mai enjoi it fragranc and it beauti final let me repeat to
thee some vers that come to my mind i heard them in a modern comedi
and it seem to me thei bear upon the point we ar discuss a
prudent old man wa give advic to anoth the father of a young
girl to lock her up watch over her and keep her in seclus and
among other argument he us these
woman is a thing of glass
but her brittl ti best
not too curious to test
who know what mai come to pass
break is an easi matter
and it folli to expos
what you cannot mend to blow
what you cant make whole to shatter
thi then all mai hold as true
and the reason plain to see
for if dana there be
there ar golden shower too
all that i have said to thee so far anselmo ha had refer to
what concern thee now it is right that i should sai someth of what
regard myself and if i be prolix pardon me for the labyrinth into
which thou hast enter and from which thou wouldst have me extric
thee make it necessari
thou dost reckon me thy friend and thou wouldst rob me of honour a
thing wholli inconsist with friendship and not onli dost thou aim
at thi but thou wouldst have me rob thee of it also that thou
wouldst rob me of it is clear for when camilla see that i pai court
to her as thou requirest she will certainli regard me as a man without
honour or right feel sinc i attempt and do a thing so much oppos
to what i ow to my own posit and thy friendship that thou wouldst
have me rob thee of it is beyond a doubt for camilla see that i
press my suit upon her will suppos that i have perceiv in her
someth light that ha encourag me to make known to her my base
desir and if she hold herself dishonour her dishonour touch
thee as belong to her and henc aris what so commonli take
place that the husband of the adulter woman though he mai not be
awar of or have given ani caus for hi wife failur in her duti or
be careless or neglig have had it in hi power to prevent hi
dishonour nevertheless is stigmatis by a vile and reproach name
and in a manner regard with ey of contempt instead of piti by all
who know of hi wife guilt though thei see that he is unfortun
not by hi own fault but by the lust of a viciou consort but i will
tell thee why with good reason dishonour attach to the husband of the
unchast wife though he know not that she is so nor be to blame nor
have done anyth or given ani provoc to make her so and be not
weari with listen to me for it will be for thy good
when god creat our first parent in the earthli paradis the holi
scriptur sai that he infus sleep into adam and while he slept took
a rib from hi left side of which he form our mother ev and when
adam awok and beheld her he said thi is flesh of my flesh and bone
of my bone and god said for thi shall a man leav hi father and
hi mother and thei shall be two in on flesh and then wa institut
the divin sacrament of marriag with such ti that death alon can
loos them and such is the forc and virtu of thi miracul
sacrament that it make two differ person on and the same flesh
and even more than thi when the virtuou ar marri for though thei
have two soul thei have but on will and henc it follow that as the
flesh of the wife is on and the same with that of her husband the
stain that mai come upon it or the injuri it incur fall upon the
husband flesh though he as ha been said mai have given no caus
for them for as the pain of the foot or ani member of the bodi is felt
by the whole bodi becaus all is on flesh as the head feel the hurt
to the ankl without have caus it so the husband be on with
her share the dishonour of the wife and as all worldli honour or
dishonour come of flesh and blood and the er wife is of that
kind the husband must need bear hi part of it and be held
dishonour without know it see then anselmo the peril thou art
encount in seek to disturb the peac of thy virtuou consort
see for what an empti and illadvis curios thou wouldst rous up
passion that now repos in quiet in the breast of thy chast wife
reflect that what thou art stake all to win is littl and what thou
wilt lose so much that i leav it undescrib not have the word to
express it but if all i have said be not enough to turn thee from thy
vile purpos thou must seek some other instrument for thy dishonour
and misfortun for such i will not consent to be though i lose thy
friendship the greatest loss that i can conceiv
have said thi the wise and virtuou lothario wa silent and
anselmo troubl in mind and deep in thought wa unabl for a while
to utter a word in repli but at length he said i have listen
lothario my friend attent as thou hast seen to what thou hast
chosen to sai to me and in thy argument exampl and comparison i
have seen that high intellig thou dost possess and the perfect
of true friendship thou hast reach and likewis i see and confess
that if i am not guid by thy opinion but follow my own i am fly
from the good and pursu the evil thi be so thou must rememb
that i am now labour under that infirm which women sometim
suffer from when the crave seiz them to eat clai plaster
charcoal and thing even wors disgust to look at much more to
eat so that it will be necessari to have recours to some artific to
cure me and thi can be easili effect if onli thou wilt make a
begin even though it be in a lukewarm and makebeliev fashion to
pai court to camilla who will not be so yield that her virtu will
give wai at the first attack with thi mere attempt i shall rest
satisfi and thou wilt have done what our friendship bind thee to
do not onli in give me life but in persuad me not to discard my
honour and thi thou art bound to do for on reason alon that
be as i am resolv to appli thi test it is not for thee to
permit me to reveal my weak to anoth and so imperil that honour
thou art strive to keep me from lose and if thine mai not stand as
high as it ought in the estim of camilla while thou art pai
court to her that is of littl or no import becaus er long on
find in her that constanc which we expect thou canst tell her the
plain truth as regard our stratagem and so regain thy place in her
esteem and as thou art ventur so littl and by the ventur canst
afford me so much satisfact refus not to undertak it even if
further difficulti present themselv to thee for as i have said
if thou wilt onli make a begin i will acknowledg the issu
decid
lothario see the fix determin of anselmo and not know
what further exampl to offer or argument to urg in order to
dissuad him from it and perceiv that he threaten to confid hi
pernici scheme to someon els to avoid a greater evil resolv to
gratifi him and do what he ask intend to manag the busi so
as to satisfi anselmo without corrupt the mind of camilla so in
repli he told him not to commun hi purpos to ani other for he
would undertak the task himself and would begin it as soon as he
pleas anselmo embrac him warmli and affection and thank
him for hi offer as if he had bestow some great favour upon him and
it wa agre between them to set about it the next dai anselmo
afford opportun and time to lothario to convers alon with
camilla and furnish him with monei and jewel to offer and present
to her he suggest too that he should treat her to music and write
vers in her prais and if he wa unwil to take the troubl of
compos them he offer to do it himself lothario agre to all
with an intent veri differ from what anselmo suppos and with
thi understand thei return to anselmo hous where thei found
camilla await her husband anxious and uneasili for he wa later
than usual in return that dai lothario repair to hi own hous
and anselmo remain in hi as well satisfi as lothario wa troubl
in mind for he could see no satisfactori wai out of thi illadvis
busi that night howev he thought of a plan by which he might
deceiv anselmo without ani injuri to camilla the next dai he went to
dine with hi friend and wa welcom by camilla who receiv and
treat him with great cordial know the affect her husband
felt for him when dinner wa over and the cloth remov anselmo told
lothario to stai there with camilla while he attend to some press
busi as he would return in an hour and a half camilla beg him
not to go and lothario offer to accompani him but noth could
persuad anselmo who on the contrari press lothario to remain
wait for him as he had a matter of great import to discuss with
him at the same time he bade camilla not to leav lothario alon until
he came back in short he contriv to put so good a face on the
reason or the folli of hi absenc that no on could have suspect
it wa a pretenc
anselmo took hi departur and camilla and lothario were left alon at
the tabl for the rest of the household had gone to dinner lothario
saw himself in the list accord to hi friend wish and face an
enemi that could by her beauti alon vanquish a squadron of arm
knight judg whether he had good reason to fear but what he did wa
to lean hi elbow on the arm of the chair and hi cheek upon hi hand
and ask camilla pardon for hi ill manner he said he wish to
take a littl sleep until anselmo return camilla in repli said he
could repos more at hi eas in the receptionroom than in hi chair
and beg of him to go in and sleep there but lothario declin and
there he remain asleep until the return of anselmo who find
camilla in her own room and lothario asleep imagin that he had
stai awai so long as to have afford them time enough for
convers and even for sleep and wa all impati until lothario
should wake up that he might go out with him and question him as to
hi success everyth fell out as he wish lothario awok and the
two at onc left the hous and anselmo ask what he wa anxiou to
know and lothario in answer told him that he had not thought it
advis to declar himself entir the first time and therefor had
onli extol the charm of camilla tell her that all the citi
spoke of noth els but her beauti and wit for thi seem to him an
excel wai of begin to gain her goodwil and render her
dispos to listen to him with pleasur the next time thu avail
himself of the devic the devil ha recours to when he would deceiv
on who is on the watch for he be the angel of dark transform
himself into an angel of light and under cover of a fair seem
disclos himself at length and effect hi purpos if at the
begin hi wile ar not discov all thi gave great
satisfact to anselmo and he said he would afford the same
opportun everi dai but without leav the hous for he would find
thing to do at home so that camilla should not detect the plot
thu then sever dai went by and lothario without utter a word
to camilla report to anselmo that he had talk with her and that he
had never been abl to draw from her the slightest indic of
consent to anyth dishonour nor even a sign or shadow of hope
on the contrari he said she would inform her husband of it
so far well said anselmo camilla ha thu far resist word we
must now see how she will resist deed i will give you tomorrow two
thousand crown in gold for you to offer or even present and as mani
more to bui jewel to lure her for women ar fond of be becomingli
attir and go gaili dress and all the more so if thei ar
beauti howev chast thei mai be and if she resist thi
temptat i will rest satisfi and will give you no more troubl
lothario repli that now he had begun he would carri on the
undertak to the end though he perceiv he wa to come out of it
weari and vanquish the next dai he receiv the four thousand
crown and with them four thousand perplex for he knew not what
to sai by wai of a new falsehood but in the end he made up hi mind to
tell him that camilla stood as firm against gift and promis as
against word and that there wa no us in take ani further troubl
for the time wa all spent to no purpos
but chanc direct thing in a differ manner so order it that
anselmo have left lothario and camilla alon as on other occas
shut himself into a chamber and post himself to watch and listen
through the keyhol to what pass between them and perceiv that for
more than half an hour lothario did not utter a word to camilla nor
would utter a word though he were to be there for an ag and he came
to the conclus that what hi friend had told him about the repli
of camilla wa all invent and falsehood and to ascertain if it were
so he came out and call lothario asid ask him what new he had
and in what humour camilla wa lothario repli that he wa not
dispos to go on with the busi for she had answer him so
angrili and harshli that he had no heart to sai anyth more to her
ah lothario lothario said anselmo how ill dost thou meet thy
oblig to me and the great confid i repos in thee i have
been just now watch through thi keyhol and i have seen that thou
hast not said a word to camilla whenc i conclud that on the former
occas thou hast not spoken to her either and if thi be so as no
doubt it is why dost thou deceiv me or wherefor seekest thou by
craft to depriv me of the mean i might find of attain my desir
anselmo said no more but he had said enough to cover lothario with
shame and confus and he feel as it were hi honour touch by
have been detect in a lie swore to anselmo that he would from that
moment devot himself to satisfi him without ani decept as he
would see if he had the curios to watch though he need not take the
troubl for the pain he would take to satisfi him would remov all
suspicion from hi mind anselmo believ him and to afford him an
opportun more free and less liabl to surpris he resolv to
absent himself from hi hous for eight dai betak himself to that
of a friend of hi who live in a villag not far from the citi and
the better to account for hi departur to camilla he so arrang it
that the friend should send him a veri press invit
unhappi shortsight anselmo what art thou do what art thou
plot what art thou devis bethink thee thou art work against
thyself plot thine own dishonour devis thine own ruin thy
wife camilla is virtuou thou dost possess her in peac and quiet
no on assail thy happi her thought wander not beyond the wall
of thy hous thou art her heaven on earth the object of her wish
the fulfil of her desir the measur wherewith she measur her
will make it conform in all thing to thine and heaven if then
the mine of her honour beauti virtu and modesti yield thee without
labour all the wealth it contain and thou canst wish for why wilt
thou dig the earth in search of fresh vein of new unknown treasur
risk the collaps of all sinc it but rest on the feebl prop of
her weak natur bethink thee that from him who seek imposs
that which is possibl mai with justic be withheld as wa better
express by a poet who said
ti mine to seek for life in death
health in diseas seek i
i seek in prison freedom breath
in traitor loyalti
so fate that ever scorn to grant
or grace or boon to me
sinc what can never be i want
deni me what might be
the next dai anselmo took hi departur for the villag leav
instruct with camilla that dure hi absenc lothario would come
to look after hi hous and to dine with her and that she wa to treat
him as she would himself camilla wa distress as a discreet and
rightmind woman would be at the order her husband left her and
bade him rememb that it wa not becom that anyon should occupi
hi seat at the tabl dure hi absenc and if he act thu from not
feel confid that she would be abl to manag hi hous let him
try her thi time and he would find by experi that she wa equal
to greater respons anselmo repli that it wa hi pleasur
to have it so and that she had onli to submit and obei camilla said
she would do so though against her will
anselmo went and the next dai lothario came to hi hous where he wa
receiv by camilla with a friendli and modest welcom but she never
suffer lothario to see her alon for she wa alwai attend by her
men and women servant especi by a handmaid of her leonela by
name to whom she wa much attach for thei had been brought up
togeth from childhood in her father hous and whom she had kept
with her after her marriag with anselmo the first three dai lothario
did not speak to her though he might have done so when thei remov
the cloth and the servant retir to dine hastili for such were
camilla order nai more leonela had direct to dine earlier than
camilla and never to leav her side she howev have her thought
fix upon other thing more to her tast and want that time and
opportun for her own pleasur did not alwai obei her mistresss
command but on the contrari left them alon as if thei had order
her to do so but the modest bear of camilla the calm of her
counten the composur of her aspect were enough to bridl the
tongu of lothario but the influenc which the mani virtu of camilla
exert in impos silenc on lothario tongu prove mischiev for
both of them for if hi tongu wa silent hi thought were busi and
could dwell at leisur upon the perfect of camilla good and
beauti on by on charm enough to warm with love a marbl statu not
to sai a heart of flesh lothario gaze upon her when he might have
been speak to her and thought how worthi of be love she wa
and thu reflect began littl by littl to assail hi allegi to
anselmo and a thousand time he thought of withdraw from the citi
and go where anselmo should never see him nor he see camilla but
alreadi the delight he found in gaze on her interpos and held him
fast he put a constraint upon himself and struggl to repel and
repress the pleasur he found in contempl camilla when alon he
blame himself for hi weak call himself a bad friend nai a bad
christian then he argu the matter and compar himself with anselmo
alwai come to the conclus that the folli and rash of anselmo
had been wors than hi faithless and that if he could excus hi
intent as easili befor god as with man he had no reason to fear
ani punish for hi offenc
in short the beauti and good of camilla join with the
opportun which the blind husband had place in hi hand overthrew
the loyalti of lothario and give heed to noth save the object
toward which hi inclin led him after anselmo had been three
dai absent dure which he had been carri on a continu struggl
with hi passion he began to make love to camilla with so much
vehem and warmth of languag that she wa overwhelm with
amaz and could onli rise from her place and retir to her room
without answer him a word but the hope which alwai spring up with
love wa not weaken in lothario by thi repel demeanour on the
contrari hi passion for camilla increas and she discov in him
what she had never expect knew not what to do and consid it
neither safe nor right to give him the chanc or opportun of
speak to her again she resolv to send as she did that veri
night on of her servant with a letter to anselmo in which she
address the follow word to him
chapter xxxiv
in which is continu the novel of the illadvis curios
it is commonli said that an armi look ill without it gener and a
castl without it castellan and i sai that a young marri woman
look still wors without her husband unless there ar veri good
reason for it i find myself so ill at eas without you and so
incap of endur thi separ that unless you return quickli i
shall have to go for relief to my parent hous even if i leav your
without a protector for the on you left me if inde he deserv
that titl ha i think more regard to hi own pleasur than to what
concern you as you ar possess of discern i need sai no more to
you nor inde is it fit i should sai more
anselmo receiv thi letter and from it he gather that lothario had
alreadi begun hi task and that camilla must have repli to him as he
would have wish and delight beyond measur at such intellig he
sent word to her not to leav hi hous on ani account as he would
veri shortli return camilla wa astonish at anselmo repli which
place her in greater perplex than befor for she neither dare to
remain in her own hous nor yet to go to her parent for in
remain her virtu wa imperil and in go she wa oppos her
husband command final she decid upon what wa the wors cours
for her to remain resolv not to fly from the presenc of lothario
that she might not give food for gossip to her servant and she now
began to regret have written as she had to her husband fear he
might imagin that lothario had perceiv in her some light which
had impel him to lai asid the respect he ow her but confid of
her rectitud she put her trust in god and in her own virtuou
intent with which she hope to resist in silenc all the
solicit of lothario without sai anyth to her husband so as
not to involv him in ani quarrel or troubl and she even began to
consid how to excus lothario to anselmo when he should ask her what
it wa that induc her to write that letter with these resolut
more honour than judici or effectu she remain the next dai
listen to lothario who press hi suit so strenuous that
camilla firm began to waver and her virtu had enough to do to
come to the rescu of her ey and keep them from show sign of a
certain tender compass which the tear and appeal of lothario had
awaken in her bosom lothario observ all thi and it inflam him
all the more in short he felt that while anselmo absenc afford
time and opportun he must press the sieg of the fortress and so he
assail her selfesteem with prais of her beauti for there is
noth that more quickli reduc and level the castl tower of fair
women vaniti than vaniti itself upon the tongu of flatteri in fact
with the utmost assidu he undermin the rock of her puriti with
such engin that had camilla been of brass she must have fallen he
wept he entreat he promis he flatter he importun he
pretend with so much feel and appar sincer that he
overthrew the virtuou resolv of camilla and won the triumph he least
expect and most long for camilla yield camilla fell but what
wonder if the friendship of lothario could not stand firm a clear
proof to us that the passion of love is to be conquer onli by fly
from it and that no on should engag in a struggl with an enemi so
mighti for divin strength is need to overcom hi human power
leonela alon knew of her mistresss weak for the two fals
friend and new lover were unabl to conceal it lothario did not care
to tell camilla the object anselmo had in view nor that he had
afford him the opportun of attain such a result lest she
should undervalu hi love and think that it wa by chanc and without
intend it and not of hi own accord that he had made love to her
a few dai later anselmo return to hi hous and did not perceiv
what it had lost that which he so lightli treat and so highli
prize he went at onc to see lothario and found him at home thei
embrac each other and anselmo ask for the tide of hi life or
hi death
the tide i have to give thee anselmo my friend said lothario
ar that thou dost possess a wife that is worthi to be the pattern and
crown of all good wive the word that i have address to her were
born awai on the wind my promis have been despis my present
have been refus such feign tear as i shed have been turn into
open ridicul in short as camilla is the essenc of all beauti so is
she the treasurehous where puriti dwell and gentl and modesti
abid with all the virtu that can confer prais honour and
happi upon a woman take back thy monei my friend here it is and
i have had no need to touch it for the chastiti of camilla yield not
to thing so base as gift or promis be content anselmo and
refrain from make further proof and as thou hast pass dryshod
through the sea of those doubt and suspicion that ar and mai be
entertain of women seek not to plung again into the deep ocean of
new embarrass or with anoth pilot make trial of the good
and strength of the bark that heaven ha grant thee for thy passag
across the sea of thi world but reckon thyself now safe in port moor
thyself with the anchor of sound reflect and rest in peac until
thou art call upon to pai that debt which no nobil on earth can
escap pai
anselmo wa complet satisfi by the word of lothario and believ
them as fulli as if thei had been spoken by an oracl nevertheless he
beg of him not to relinquish the undertak were it but for the
sake of curios and amus though thenceforward he need not make
us of the same earnest endeavour as befor all he wish him to do
wa to write some vers to her prais her under the name of
chlori for he himself would give her to understand that he wa in
love with a ladi to whom he had given that name to enabl him to sing
her prais with the decorum due to her modesti and if lothario were
unwil to take the troubl of write the vers he would compos
them himself
that will not be necessari said lothario for the muse ar not
such enemi of mine but that thei visit me now and then in the cours
of the year do thou tell camilla what thou hast propos about a
pretend amour of mine as for the vers i will make them and if not
as good as the subject deserv thei shall be at least the best i can
produc an agreement to thi effect wa made between the friend the
illadvis on and the treacher and anselmo return to hi hous
ask camilla the question she alreadi wonder he had not ask
beforewhat it wa that had caus her to write the letter she had sent
him camilla repli that it had seem to her that lothario look at
her somewhat more freeli than when he had been at home but that now
she wa undeceiv and believ it to have been onli her own
imagin for lothario now avoid see her or be alon with
her anselmo told her she might be quit easi on the score of that
suspicion for he knew that lothario wa in love with a damsel of rank
in the citi whom he celebr under the name of chlori and that even
if he were not hi fidel and their great friendship left no room
for fear had not camilla howev been inform beforehand by
lothario that thi love for chlori wa a pretenc and that he himself
had told anselmo of it in order to be abl sometim to give utter
to the prais of camilla herself no doubt she would have fallen into
the despair toil of jealousi but be forewarn she receiv the
startl new without uneasi
the next dai as the three were at tabl anselmo ask lothario to
recit someth of what he had compos for hi mistress chlori for
as camilla did not know her he might safe sai what he like
even did she know her return lothario i would hide noth for
when a lover prais hi ladi beauti and charg her with cruelti
he cast no imput upon her fair name at ani rate all i can sai
is that yesterdai i made a sonnet on the ingratitud of thi chlori
which goe thu
sonnet
at midnight in the silenc when the ey
of happier mortal balmi slumber close
the weari tale of my unnumb woe
to chlori and to heaven is wont to rise
and when the light of dai return dye
the portal of the east with tint of rose
with undiminish forc my sorrow flow
in broken accent and in burn sigh
and when the sun ascend hi stargirt throne
and on the earth pour down hi middai beam
noon but renew my wail and my tear
and with the night again goe up my moan
yet ever in my agoni it seem
to me that neither heaven nor chlori hear
the sonnet pleas camilla and still more anselmo for he prais it
and said the ladi wa excess cruel who made no return for
sincer so manifest on which camilla said then all that
lovesmitten poet sai is true
as poet thei do not tell the truth repli lothario but as lover
thei ar not more defect in express than thei ar truth
there is no doubt of that observ anselmo anxiou to support and
uphold lothario idea with camilla who wa as regardless of hi
design as she wa deep in love with lothario and so take delight in
anyth that wa hi and know that hi thought and write had
her for their object and that she herself wa the real chlori she
ask him to repeat some other sonnet or vers if he recollect ani
i do repli lothario but i do not think it as good as the first
on or more correctli speak less bad but you can easili judg
for it is thi
sonnet
i know that i am doom death is to me
as certain as that thou ungrat fair
dead at thy feet shouldst see me ly er
my heart repent of it love for thee
if buri in oblivion i should be
bereft of life fame favour even there
it would be found that i thy imag bear
deep graven in my breast for all to see
thi like some holi relic do i prize
to save me from the fate my truth entail
truth that to thy hard heart it vigour ow
ala for him that under lower ski
in peril oer a trackless ocean sail
where neither friendli port nor polestar show
anselmo prais thi second sonnet too as he had prais the first
and so he went on ad link after link to the chain with which he wa
bind himself and make hi dishonour secur for when lothario wa
do most to dishonour him he told him he wa most honour and thu
each step that camilla descend toward the depth of her abas
she mount in hi opinion toward the summit of virtu and fair
fame
it so happen that find herself on on occas alon with her
maid camilla said to her i am asham to think my dear leonela how
lightli i have valu myself that i did not compel lothario to purchas
by at least some expenditur of time that full possess of me that i
so quickli yield him of my own free will i fear that he will think
ill of my plianci or light not consid the irresist
influenc he brought to bear upon me
let not that troubl you my ladi said leonela for it doe not
take awai the valu of the thing given or make it the less preciou to
give it quickli if it be realli valuabl and worthi of be prize
nai thei ar wont to sai that he who give quickli give twice
thei sai also said camilla that what cost littl is valu less
that sai doe not hold good in your case repli leonela for
love as i have heard sai sometim fli and sometim walk with
thi on it run with that it move slowli some it cool other it
burn some it wound other it slai it begin the cours of it
desir and at the same moment complet and end it in the morn
it will lai sieg to a fortress and by night will have taken it for
there is no power that can resist it so what ar you in dread of what
do you fear when the same must have befallen lothario love have
chosen the absenc of my lord as the instrument for subdu you and
it wa absolut necessari to complet then what love had resolv
upon without afford the time to let anselmo return and by hi
presenc compel the work to be left unfinish for love ha no better
agent for carri out hi design than opportun and of opportun
he avail himself in all hi feat especi at the outset all thi
i know well myself more by experi than by hearsai and some dai
seora i will enlighten you on the subject for i am of your flesh and
blood too moreov ladi camilla you did not surrend yourself or
yield so quickli but that first you saw lothario whole soul in hi
ey in hi sigh in hi word hi promis and hi gift and by it
and hi good qualiti perceiv how worthi he wa of your love thi
then be the case let not these scrupul and prudish idea
troubl your imagin but be assur that lothario prize you as
you do him and rest content and satisfi that as you ar caught in
the noos of love it is on of worth and merit that ha taken you and
on that ha not onli the four ss that thei sai true lover ought to
have but a complet alphabet onli listen to me and you will see how i
can repeat it by rote he is to my ey and think amiabl brave
courteou distinguish eleg fond gai honour illustri
loyal manli nobl open polit quickwit rich and the ss
accord to the sai and then tender veraci x doe not suit
him for it is a rough letter y ha been given alreadi and z zealou
for your honour
camilla laugh at her maid alphabet and perceiv her to be more
experienc in love affair than she said which she admit
confess to camilla that she had love passag with a young man of
good birth of the same citi camilla wa uneasi at thi dread lest
it might prove the mean of endang her honour and ask whether
her intrigu had gone beyond word and she with littl shame and much
effronteri said it had for certain it is that ladi imprud make
servant shameless who when thei see their mistress make a fals
step think noth of go astrai themselv or of it be known
all that camilla could do wa to entreat leonela to sai noth about
her do to him whom she call her lover and to conduct her own
affair secretli lest thei should come to the knowledg of anselmo or
of lothario leonela said she would but kept her word in such a wai
that she confirm camilla apprehens of lose her reput
through her mean for thi abandon and bold leonela as soon as she
perceiv that her mistresss demeanour wa not what it wa wont to be
had the audac to introduc her lover into the hous confid that
even if her mistress saw him she would not dare to expos him for the
sin of mistress entail thi mischief among other thei make
themselv the slave of their own servant and ar oblig to hide
their laxiti and deprav as wa the case with camilla who
though she perceiv not onc but mani time that leonela wa with
her lover in some room of the hous not onli did not dare to chide
her but afford her opportun for conceal him and remov all
difficulti lest he should be seen by her husband she wa unabl
howev to prevent him from be seen on on occas as he salli
forth at daybreak by lothario who not know who he wa at first
took him for a spectr but as soon as he saw him hasten awai
muffl hi face with hi cloak and conceal himself carefulli and
cautious he reject thi foolish idea and adopt anoth which
would have been the ruin of all had not camilla found a remedi it did
not occur to lothario that thi man he had seen issu at such an
untim hour from anselmo hous could have enter it on leonela
account nor did he even rememb there wa such a person as leonela
all he thought wa that as camilla had been light and yield with
him so she had been with anoth for thi further penalti the er
woman sin bring with it that her honour is distrust even by him
to whose overtur and persuas she ha yield and he believ her
to have surrend more easili to other and give implicit credenc
to everi suspicion that come into hi mind all lothario good sens
seem to have fail him at thi junctur all hi prudent maxim
escap hi memori for without onc reflect ration and without
more ado in hi impati and in the blind of the jealou rage
that gnaw hi heart and dy to reveng himself upon camilla who
had done him no wrong befor anselmo had risen he hasten to him and
said to him know anselmo that for sever dai past i have been
struggl with myself strive to withhold from thee what it is no
longer possibl or right that i should conceal from thee know that
camilla fortress ha surrend and is readi to submit to my will
and if i have been slow to reveal thi fact to thee it wa in order to
see if it were some light capric of her or if she sought to try me
and ascertain if the love i began to make to her with thy permiss
wa made with a seriou intent i thought too that she if she
were what she ought to be and what we both believ her would have
er thi given thee inform of my address but see that she
delai i believ the truth of the promis she ha given me that the
next time thou art absent from the hous she will grant me an interview
in the closet where thy jewel ar kept and it wa true that camilla
us to meet him there but i do not wish thee to rush precipit
to take vengeanc for the sin is as yet onli commit in intent
and camilla mai chang perhap between thi and the appoint time
and repent spring up in it place as hitherto thou hast alwai
follow my advic wholli or in part follow and observ thi that i
will give thee now so that without mistak and with matur
deliber thou mayest satisfi thyself as to what mai seem the best
cours pretend to absent thyself for two or three dai as thou hast
been wont to do on other occas and contriv to hide thyself in the
closet for the tapestri and other thing there afford great
facil for thy conceal and then thou wilt see with thine own
ey and i with mine what camilla purpos mai be and if it be a
guilti on which mai be fear rather than expect with silenc
prudenc and discret thou canst thyself becom the instrument of
punish for the wrong done thee
anselmo wa amaz overwhelm and astound at the word of
lothario which came upon him at a time when he least expect to hear
them for he now look upon camilla as have triumph over the
pretend attack of lothario and wa begin to enjoi the glori of
her victori he remain silent for a consider time look on the
ground with fix gaze and at length said thou hast behav
lothario as i expect of thy friendship i will follow thy advic in
everyth do as thou wilt and keep thi secret as thou seest it
should be kept in circumst so unlook for
lothario gave him hi word but after leav him he repent
altogeth of what he had said to him perceiv how foolishli he had
act as he might have reveng himself upon camilla in some less
cruel and degrad wai he curs hi want of sens condemn hi
hasti resolut and knew not what cours to take to undo the mischief
or find some readi escap from it at last he decid upon reveal
all to camilla and as there wa no want of opportun for do so
he found her alon the same dai but she as soon as she had the chanc
of speak to him said lothario my friend i must tell thee i have
a sorrow in my heart which fill it so that it seem readi to burst
and it will be a wonder if it doe not for the audac of leonela ha
now reach such a pitch that everi night she conceal a gallant of
her in thi hous and remain with him till morn at the expens of
my reput inasmuch as it is open to anyon to question it who mai
see him quit my hous at such unseason hour but what
distress me is that i cannot punish or chide her for her priviti to
our intrigu bridl my mouth and keep me silent about her while i
am dread that some catastroph will come of it
as camilla said thi lothario at first imagin it wa some devic to
delud him into the idea that the man he had seen go out wa
leonela lover and not her but when he saw how she wept and
suffer and beg him to help her he becam convinc of the truth
and the convict complet hi confus and remors howev he
told camilla not to distress herself as he would take measur to put
a stop to the insol of leonela at the same time he told her what
driven by the fierc rage of jealousi he had said to anselmo and how
he had arrang to hide himself in the closet that he might there see
plainli how littl she preserv her fidel to him and he entreat
her pardon for thi mad and her advic as to how to repair it and
escap safe from the intric labyrinth in which hi imprud had
involv him camilla wa struck with alarm at hear what lothario
said and with much anger and great good sens she reprov him and
rebuk hi base design and the foolish and mischiev resolut he
had made but as woman ha by natur a nimbler wit than man for good
and for evil though it is apt to fail when she set herself
deliber to reason camilla on the spur of the moment thought of a
wai to remedi what wa to all appear irremedi and told
lothario to contriv that the next dai anselmo should conceal himself
in the place he mention for she hope from hi conceal to obtain
the mean of their enjoi themselv for the futur without ani
apprehens and without reveal her purpos to him entir she
charg him to be care as soon as anselmo wa conceal to come to
her when leonela should call him and to all she said to him to answer
as he would have answer had he not known that anselmo wa listen
lothario press her to explain her intent fulli so that he might
with more certainti and precaut take care to do what he saw to be
need
i tell you said camilla there is noth to take care of except to
answer me what i shall ask you for she did not wish to explain to him
beforehand what she meant to do fear lest he should be unwil to
follow out an idea which seem to her such a good on and should try
or devis some other less practic plan
lothario then retir and the next dai anselmo under pretenc of
go to hi friend countri hous took hi departur and then
return to conceal himself which he wa abl to do easili as camilla
and leonela took care to give him the opportun and so he place
himself in hide in the state of agit that it mai be imagin he
would feel who expect to see the vital of hi honour laid bare
befor hi ey and found himself on the point of lose the suprem
bless he thought he possess in hi belov camilla have made
sure of anselmo be in hi hidingplac camilla and leonela
enter the closet and the instant she set foot within it camilla
said with a deep sigh ah dear leonela would it not be better
befor i do what i am unwil you should know lest you should seek to
prevent it that you should take anselmo dagger that i have ask of
you and with it pierc thi vile heart of mine but no there is no
reason why i should suffer the punish of anoth fault i will
first know what it is that the bold licenti ey of lothario have
seen in me that could have encourag him to reveal to me a design so
base as that which he ha disclos regardless of hi friend and of my
honour go to the window leonela and call him for no doubt he is in
the street wait to carri out hi vile project but mine cruel it
mai be but honour shall be carri out first
ah seora said the crafti leonela who knew her part what is it
you want to do with thi dagger can it be that you mean to take your
own life or lothario for whichev you mean to do it will lead to
the loss of your reput and good name it is better to dissembl
your wrong and not give thi wick man the chanc of enter the
hous now and find us alon consid seora we ar weak women and
he is a man and determin and as he come with such a base purpos
blind and urg by passion perhap befor you can put your into
execut he mai do what will be wors for you than take your life
ill betid my master anselmo for give such author in hi hous
to thi shameless fellow and suppos you kill him seora as i
suspect you mean to do what shall we do with him when he is dead
what my friend repli camilla we shall leav him for anselmo to
buri him for in reason it will be to him a light labour to hide hi
own infami under ground summon him make hast for all the time i
delai in take vengeanc for my wrong seem to me an offenc against
the loyalti i ow my husband
anselmo wa listen to all thi and everi word that camilla utter
made him chang hi mind but when he heard that it wa resolv to
kill lothario hi first impuls wa to come out and show himself to
avert such a disast but in hi anxieti to see the issu of a
resolut so bold and virtuou he restrain himself intend to
come forth in time to prevent the deed at thi moment camilla
throw herself upon a bed that wa close by swoon awai and
leonela began to weep bitterli exclaim woe is me that i should
be fate to have dy here in my arm the flower of virtu upon earth
the crown of true wive the pattern of chastiti with more to the
same effect so that anyon who heard her would have taken her for the
most tenderheart and faith handmaid in the world and her
mistress for anoth persecut penelop
camilla wa not long in recov from her faint fit and on come
to herself she said why do you not go leonela to call hither that
friend the falsest to hi friend the sun ever shone upon or night
conceal awai run hast speed lest the fire of my wrath burn
itself out with delai and the righteou vengeanc that i hope for melt
awai in menac and maledict
i am just go to call him seora said leonela but you must
first give me that dagger lest while i am gone you should by mean of
it give caus to all who love you to weep all their live
go in peac dear leonela i will not do so said camilla for rash
and foolish as i mai be to your mind in defend my honour i am not
go to be so much so as that lucretia who thei sai kill herself
without have done anyth wrong and without have first kill him
on whom the guilt of her misfortun lai i shall die if i am to die
but it must be after full vengeanc upon him who ha brought me here to
weep over audac that no fault of mine gave birth to
leonela requir much press befor she would go to summon lothario
but at last she went and while await her return camilla continu
as if speak to herself good god would it not have been more
prudent to have repuls lothario as i have done mani a time befor
than to allow him as i am now do to think me unchast and vile
even for the short time i must wait until i undec him no doubt it
would have been better but i should not be aveng nor the honour of
my husband vindic should he find so clear and easi an escap from
the strait into which hi deprav ha led him let the traitor pai
with hi life for the temer of hi wanton wish and let the world
know if hapli it shall ever come to know that camilla not onli
preserv her allegi to her husband but aveng him of the man who
dare to wrong him still i think it might be better to disclos thi
to anselmo but then i have call hi attent to it in the letter i
wrote to him in the countri and if he did noth to prevent the
mischief i there point out to him i suppos it wa that from pure
good of heart and trust he would not and could not believ
that ani thought against hi honour could harbour in the breast of so
stanch a friend nor inde did i myself believ it for mani dai nor
should i have ever believ it if hi insol had not gone so far as
to make it manifest by open present lavish promis and ceaseless
tear but why do i argu thu doe a bold determin stand in need
of argument sure not then traitor avaunt vengeanc to my aid
let the fals on come approach advanc die yield up hi life and
then befal what mai pure i came to him whom heaven bestow upon me
pure i shall leav him and at the worst bath in my own chast blood
and in the foul blood of the falsest friend that friendship ever saw in
the world and as she utter these word she pace the room hold
the unsheath dagger with such irregular and disord step and
such gestur that on would have suppos her to have lost her sens
and taken her for some violent desperado instead of a delic woman
anselmo conceal behind some tapestri where he had hidden himself
beheld and wa amaz at all and alreadi felt that what he had seen
and heard wa a suffici answer to even greater suspicion and he
would have been now well pleas if the proof afford by lothario
come were dispens with as he fear some sudden mishap but as he
wa on the point of show himself and come forth to embrac and
undec hi wife he paus as he saw leonela return lead
lothario camilla when she saw him draw a long line in front of her
on the floor with the dagger said to him lothario pai attent to
what i sai to thee if by ani chanc thou darest to cross thi line
thou seest or even approach it the instant i see thee attempt it that
same instant will i pierc my bosom with thi dagger that i hold in my
hand and befor thou answerest me a word i desir thee to listen to a
few from me and afterward thou shalt repli as mai pleas thee first
i desir thee to tell me lothario if thou knowest my husband anselmo
and in what light thou regardest him and secondli i desir to know if
thou knowest me too answer me thi without embarrass or
reflect deepli what thou wilt answer for thei ar no riddl i put
to thee
lothario wa not so dull but that from the first moment when camilla
direct him to make anselmo hide himself he understood what she
intend to do and therefor he fell in with her idea so readili and
promptli that between them thei made the impostur look more true than
truth so he answer her thu i did not think fair camilla that
thou wert call me to ask question so remot from the object with
which i come but if it is to defer the promis reward thou art do
so thou mightst have put it off still longer for the long for
happi give the more distress the nearer come the hope of gain
it but lest thou shouldst sai that i do not answer thy question i
sai that i know thy husband anselmo and that we have known each other
from our earliest year i will not speak of what thou too knowest of
our friendship that i mai not compel myself to testifi against the
wrong that love the mighti excus for greater error make me inflict
upon him thee i know and hold in the same estim as he doe for
were it not so i had not for a lesser prize act in opposit to what
i ow to my station and the holi law of true friendship now broken
and violat by me through that power enemi love
if thou dost confess that return camilla mortal enemi of all
that rightli deserv to be love with what face dost thou dare to
come befor on whom thou knowest to be the mirror wherein he is
reflect on whom thou shouldst look to see how unworthili thou
wrongest him but woe is me i now comprehend what ha made thee give
so littl heed to what thou owest to thyself it must have been some
freedom of mine for i will not call it immodesti as it did not
proce from ani deliber intent but from some heedless such
as women ar guilti of through inadvert when thei think thei have
no occas for reserv but tell me traitor when did i by word or
sign give a repli to thy prayer that could awaken in thee a shadow of
hope of attain thy base wish when were not thy profess of
love sternli and scornfulli reject and rebuk when were thy
frequent pledg and still more frequent gift believ or accept
but as i am persuad that no on can long persever in the attempt to
win love unsustain by some hope i am will to attribut to myself
the blame of thy assur for no doubt some thoughtless of mine
ha all thi time foster thy hope and therefor will i punish
myself and inflict upon myself the penalti thy guilt deserv and that
thou mayest see that be so relentless to myself i cannot possibl be
otherwis to thee i have summon thee to be a wit of the
sacrific i mean to offer to the injur honour of my honour husband
wrong by thee with all the assidu thou wert capabl of and by me
too through want of caution in avoid everi occas if i have given
ani of encourag and sanction thy base design onc more i sai
the suspicion in my mind that some imprud of mine ha engend
these lawless thought in thee is what caus me most distress and
what i desir most to punish with my own hand for were ani other
instrument of punish emploi my error might becom perhap more
wide known but befor i do so in my death i mean to inflict death
and take with me on that will fulli satisfi my long for the reveng
i hope for and have for i shall see wheresoev it mai be that i go
the penalti award by inflex unswerv justic on him who ha
place me in a posit so desper
as she utter these word with incred energi and swift she
flew upon lothario with the nake dagger so manifestli bent on buri
it in hi breast that he wa almost uncertain whether these
demonstr were real or feign for he wa oblig to have
recours to all hi skill and strength to prevent her from strike
him and with such realiti did she act thi strang farc and
mystif that to give it a colour of truth she determin to
stain it with her own blood for perceiv or pretend that she
could not wound lothario she said fate it seem will not grant my
just desir complet satisfact but it will not be abl to keep me
from satisfi it partial at least and make an effort to free
the hand with the dagger which lothario held in hi grasp she releas
it and direct the point to a place where it could not inflict a
deep wound she plung it into her left side high up close to the
shoulder and then allow herself to fall to the ground as if in a
faint
leonela and lothario stood amaz and astound at the catastroph and
see camilla stretch on the ground and bath in her blood thei
were still uncertain as to the true natur of the act lothario
terrifi and breathless ran in hast to pluck out the dagger but
when he saw how slight the wound wa he wa reliev of hi fear and
onc more admir the subtleti cool and readi wit of the fair
camilla and the better to support the part he had to plai he began to
utter profus and dole lament over her bodi as if she were
dead invok maledict not onli on himself but also on him who had
been the mean of place him in such a posit and know that hi
friend anselmo heard him he spoke in such a wai as to make a listen
feel much more piti for him than for camilla even though he suppos
her dead leonela took her up in her arm and laid her on the bed
entreat lothario to go in quest of someon to attend to her wound in
secret and at the same time ask hi advic and opinion as to what
thei should sai to anselmo about hi ladi wound if he should chanc
to return befor it wa heal he repli thei might sai what thei
like for he wa not in a state to give advic that would be of ani
us all he could tell her wa to try and stanch the blood as he wa
go where he should never more be seen and with everi appear of
deep grief and sorrow he left the hous but when he found himself
alon and where there wa nobodi to see him he cross himself
unceasingli lost in wonder at the adroit of camilla and the
consist act of leonela he reflect how convinc anselmo would
be that he had a second portia for a wife and he look forward
anxious to meet him in order to rejoic togeth over falsehood
and truth the most craftili veil that could be imagin
leonela as he told her stanch her ladi blood which wa no more
than suffic to support her decept and wash the wound with a
littl wine she bound it up to the best of her skill talk all the
time she wa tend her in a strain that even if noth els had
been said befor would have been enough to assur anselmo that he had
in camilla a model of puriti to leonela word camilla ad her own
call herself cowardli and want in spirit sinc she had not
enough at the time she had most need of it to rid herself of the life
she so much loath she ask her attend advic as to whether or
not she ought to inform her belov husband of all that had happen
but the other bade her sai noth about it as she would lai upon him
the oblig of take vengeanc on lothario which he could not do
but at great risk to himself and it wa the duti of a true wife not to
give her husband provoc to quarrel but on the contrari to
remov it as far as possibl from him
camilla repli that she believ she wa right and that she would
follow her advic but at ani rate it would be well to consid how she
wa to explain the wound to anselmo for he could not help see it
to which leonela answer that she did not know how to tell a lie even
in jest
how then can i know my dear said camilla for i should not dare to
forg or keep up a falsehood if my life depend on it if we can think
of no escap from thi difficulti it will be better to tell him the
plain truth than that he should find us out in an untru stori
be not uneasi seora said leonela between thi and tomorrow i
will think of what we must sai to him and perhap the wound be
where it is it can be hidden from hi sight and heaven will be pleas
to aid us in a purpos so good and honour compos yourself
seora and endeavour to calm your excit lest my lord find you
agit and leav the rest to my care and god who alwai support
good intent
anselmo had with the deepest attent listen to and seen plai out
the tragedi of the death of hi honour which the perform act with
such wonderfulli effect truth that it seem as if thei had becom
the realiti of the part thei plai he long for night and an
opportun of escap from the hous to go and see hi good friend
lothario and with him give vent to hi joi over the preciou pearl he
had gain in have establish hi wife puriti both mistress and
maid took care to give him time and opportun to get awai and take
advantag of it he made hi escap and at onc went in quest of
lothario and it would be imposs to describ how he embrac him
when he found him and the thing he said to him in the joi of hi
heart and the prais he bestow upon camilla all which lothario
listen to without be abl to show ani pleasur for he could not
forget how deceiv hi friend wa and how dishonour he had
wrong him and though anselmo could see that lothario wa not glad
still he imagin it wa onli becaus he had left camilla wound and
had been himself the caus of it and so among other thing he told him
not to be distress about camilla accid for as thei had agre
to hide it from him the wound wa evid trifl and that be
so he had no caus for fear but should henceforward be of good cheer
and rejoic with him see that by hi mean and adroit he found
himself rais to the greatest height of happi that he could have
ventur to hope for and desir no better pastim than make vers
in prais of camilla that would preserv her name for all time to come
lothario commend hi purpos and promis on hi own part to aid him
in rais a monument so gloriou
and so anselmo wa left the most charmingli hoodwink man there could
be in the world he himself persuad he wa conduct the instrument
of hi glori led home by the hand of him who had been the utter
destruct of hi good name whom camilla receiv with avert
counten though with smile in her heart the decept wa carri
on for some time until at the end of a few month fortun turn her
wheel and the guilt which had been until then so skilfulli conceal
wa publish abroad and anselmo paid with hi life the penalti of hi
illadvis curios

thigh complet and wa six finger shorter behind hi leg were
veri long and lean cover with hair and anyth but clean on hi
head he had a littl greasi red cap that belong to the host round

reason best known to himself ow a grudg and in hi right hand he
held hi unsheath sword with which he wa slash about on all
side utter exclam as if he were actual fight some
giant and the best of it wa hi ey were not open for he wa fast
asleep and dream that he wa do battl with the giant for hi
imagin wa so wrought upon by the adventur he wa go to
accomplish that it made him dream he had alreadi reach the kingdom
of micomicon and wa engag in combat with hi enemi and believ
he wa lai on the giant he had given so mani sword cut to the
skin that the whole room wa full of wine on see thi the landlord
wa so enrag that he fell on don quixot and with hi clench fist
began to pummel him in such a wai that if cardenio and the curat had
not drag him off he would have brought the war of the giant to an
end but in spite of all the poor gentleman never woke until the barber
brought a great pot of cold water from the well and flung it with on
dash all over hi bodi on which don quixot woke up but not so
complet as to understand what wa the matter dorothea see how
short and slight hi attir wa would not go in to wit the battl
between her champion and her oppon as for sancho he went search
all over the floor for the head of the giant and not find it he
said i see now that it all enchant in thi hous for the last
time on thi veri spot where i am now i got ever so mani thump
without know who gave them to me or be abl to see anybodi and
now thi head is not to be seen anywher about though i saw it cut off
with my own ey and the blood run from the bodi as if from a
fountain
what blood and fountain ar you talk about enemi of god and hi
saint said the landlord dont you see you thief that the blood
and the fountain ar onli these skin here that have been stab and
the red wine swim all over the roomand i wish i saw the soul of
him that stab them swim in hell
i know noth about that said sancho all i know is it will be my
bad luck that through not find thi head my counti will melt awai
like salt in waterfor sancho awak wa wors than hi master asleep
so much had hi master promis addl hi wit
the landlord wa besid himself at the cool of the squir and the
mischiev do of the master and swore it should not be like the
last time when thei went without pai and that their privileg of
chivalri should not hold good thi time to let on or other of them off
without pai even to the cost of the plug that would have to be put
to the damag wineskin the curat wa hold don quixot hand
who fanci he had now end the adventur and wa in the presenc of
the princess micomicona knelt befor the curat and said exalt and
beauteou ladi your high mai live from thi dai forth fearless of
ani harm thi base be could do you and i too from thi dai forth am
releas from the promis i gave you sinc by the help of god on high
and by the favour of her by whom i live and breath i have fulfil

did not i sai so said sancho on hear thi you see i wasnt
drunk there you see my master ha alreadi salt the giant there no
doubt about the bull my counti is all right
who could have help laugh at the absurd of the pair master
and man and laugh thei did all except the landlord who curs
himself but at length the barber cardenio and the curat contriv
with no small troubl to get don quixot on the bed and he fell asleep
with everi appear of excess weari thei left him to sleep
and came out to the gate of the inn to consol sancho panza on not
have found the head of the giant but much more work had thei to
appeas the landlord who wa furiou at the sudden death of hi
wineskin and said the landladi half scold half cry at an
evil moment and in an unlucki hour he came into my hous thi
knighterrantwould that i had never set ey on him for dear he ha
cost me the last time he went off with the overnight score against him
for supper bed straw and barlei for himself and hi squir and a
hack and an ass sai he wa a knight adventurergod send unlucki

not bound to pai anyth for it wa so settl by the knighterrantri
tariff and then all becaus of him came the other gentleman and
carri off my tail and give it back more than two cuartillo the
wors all strip of it hair so that it is no us for my husband

and spill my wine i wish i saw hi own blood spilt but let him not
deceiv himself for by the bone of my father and the shade of my
mother thei shall pai me down everi quarto or my name is not what it
is and i am not my father daughter all thi and more to the same
effect the landladi deliv with great irrit and her good maid
maritorn back her up while the daughter held her peac and smile
from time to time the curat smooth matter by promis to make
good all loss to the best of hi power not onli as regard the
wineskin but also the wine and abov all the depreci of the
tail which thei set such store by dorothea comfort sancho tell
him that she pledg herself as soon as it should appear certain that
hi master had decapit the giant and she found herself peacefulli
establish in her kingdom to bestow upon him the best counti there
wa in it with thi sancho consol himself and assur the princess
she might reli upon it that he had seen the head of the giant and more
by token it had a beard that reach to the girdl and that if it wa
not to be seen now it wa becaus everyth that happen in that
hous went by enchant as he himself had prove the last time he
had lodg there dorothea said she fulli believ it and that he need
not be uneasi for all would go well and turn out as he wish all
therefor be appeas the curat wa anxiou to go on with the
novel as he saw there wa but littl more left to read dorothea and
the other beg him to finish it and he as he wa will to pleas
them and enjoi read it himself continu the tale in these
word
the result wa that from the confid anselmo felt in camilla
virtu he live happi and free from anxieti and camilla purpos
look coldli on lothario that anselmo might suppos her feel
toward him to be the opposit of what thei were and the better to
support the posit lothario beg to be excus from come to the
hous as the displeasur with which camilla regard hi presenc wa
plain to be seen but the befool anselmo said he would on no account
allow such a thing and so in a thousand wai he becam the author of
hi own dishonour while he believ he wa insur hi happi
meanwhil the satisfact with which leonela saw herself empow to
carri on her amour reach such a height that regardless of everyth
els she follow her inclin unrestrainedli feel confid
that her mistress would screen her and even show her how to manag it
safe at last on night anselmo heard footstep in leonela room
and on try to enter to see who it wa he found that the door wa
held against him which made him all the more determin to open it
and exert hi strength he forc it open and enter the room in
time to see a man leap through the window into the street he ran
quickli to seiz him or discov who he wa but he wa unabl to
effect either purpos for leonela flung her arm round him cry be
calm seor do not give wai to passion or follow him who ha escap
from thi he belong to me and in fact he is my husband
anselmo would not believ it but blind with rage drew a dagger and
threaten to stab leonela bid her tell the truth or he would kill
her she in her fear not know what she wa sai exclaim do
not kill me seor for i can tell you thing more import than ani
you can imagin
tell me then at onc or thou diest said anselmo
it would be imposs for me now said leonela i am so agit
leav me till tomorrow and then you shall hear from me what will fill
you with astonish but rest assur that he who leap through the
window is a young man of thi citi who ha given me hi promis to
becom my husband
anselmo wa appeas with thi and wa content to wait the time she
ask of him for he never expect to hear anyth against camilla
so satisfi and sure of her virtu wa he and so he quit the room
and left leonela lock in tell her she should not come out until
she had told him all she had to make known to him he went at onc to
see camilla and tell her as he did all that had pass between him
and her handmaid and the promis she had given him to inform him
matter of seriou import
there is no need of sai whether camilla wa agit or not for so
great wa her fear and dismai that make sure as she had good
reason to do that leonela would tell anselmo all she knew of her
faithless she had not the courag to wait and see if her
suspicion were confirm and that same night as soon as she thought
that anselmo wa asleep she pack up the most valuabl jewel she had
and some monei and without be observ by anybodi escap from the
hous and betook herself to lothario to whom she relat what had
occur implor him to convei her to some place of safeti or fly
with her where thei might be safe from anselmo the state of perplex
to which camilla reduc lothario wa such that he wa unabl to utter
a word in repli still less to decid upon what he should do at length
he resolv to conduct her to a convent of which a sister of hi wa
prioress camilla agre to thi and with the speed which the
circumst demand lothario took her to the convent and left her
there and then himself quit the citi without let anyon know of
hi departur
as soon as daylight came anselmo without miss camilla from hi
side rose eager to learn what leonela had to tell him and hasten to
the room where he had lock her in he open the door enter but
found no leonela all he found wa some sheet knot to the window a
plain proof that she had let herself down from it and escap he
return uneasi to tell camilla but not find her in bed or
anywher in the hous he wa lost in amaz he ask the servant
of the hous about her but none of them could give him ani
explan as he wa go in search of camilla it happen by chanc
that he observ her box were ly open and that the greater part
of her jewel were gone and now he becam fulli awar of hi disgrac
and that leonela wa not the caus of hi misfortun and just as he
wa without delai to dress himself complet he repair sad at
heart and deject to hi friend lothario to make known hi sorrow to

had been absent from hi hous all night and had taken with him all the
monei he had he felt as though he were lose hi sens and to make
all complet on return to hi own hous he found it desert and
empti not on of all hi servant male or femal remain in it he
knew not what to think or sai or do and hi reason seem to be
desert him littl by littl he review hi posit and saw
himself in a moment left without wife friend or servant abandon
he felt by the heaven abov him and more than all rob of hi
honour for in camilla disappear he saw hi own ruin after long
reflect he resolv at last to go to hi friend villag where he
had been stai when he afford opportun for the contriv of
thi complic of misfortun he lock the door of hi hous
mount hi hors and with a broken spirit set out on hi journei but
he had hardli gone halfwai when harass by hi reflect he had
to dismount and tie hi hors to a tree at the foot of which he threw
himself give vent to piteou heartrend sigh and there he
remain till nearli nightfal when he observ a man approach on
horseback from the citi of whom after salut him he ask what wa
the new in florenc
the citizen repli the strangest that have been heard for mani a
dai for it is report abroad that lothario the great friend of the
wealthi anselmo who live at san giovanni carri off last night
camilla the wife of anselmo who also ha disappear all thi ha
been told by a maidserv of camilla whom the governor found last
night lower herself by a sheet from the window of anselmo hous
i know not inde precis how the affair came to pass all i know
is that the whole citi is wonder at the occurr for no on could
have expect a thing of the kind see the great and intim
friendship that exist between them so great thei sai that thei
were call the two friend
is it known at all said anselmo what road lothario and camilla
took
not in the least said the citizen though the governor ha been
veri activ in search for them
god speed you seor said anselmo
god be with you said the citizen and went hi wai
thi disastr intellig almost rob anselmo not onli of hi
sens but of hi life he got up as well as he wa abl and reach
the hous of hi friend who as yet knew noth of hi misfortun but
see him come pale worn and haggard perceiv that he wa
suffer some heavi afflict anselmo at onc beg to be allow
to retir to rest and to be given write materi hi wish wa
compli with and he wa left ly down and alon for he desir
thi and even that the door should be lock find himself alon he
so took to heart the thought of hi misfortun that by the sign of
death he felt within him he knew well hi life wa draw to a close
and therefor he resolv to leav behind him a declar of the
caus of hi strang end he began to write but befor he had put down
all he meant to sai hi breath fail him and he yield up hi life
a victim to the suffer which hi illadvis curios had entail
upon him the master of the hous observ that it wa now late and
that anselmo did not call determin to go in and ascertain if hi
indisposit wa increas and found him ly on hi face hi bodi
partli in the bed partli on the writingt on which he lai with
the written paper open and the pen still in hi hand have first
call to him without receiv ani answer hi host approach him
and take him by the hand found that it wa cold and saw that he wa
dead greatli surpris and distress he summon the household to
wit the sad fate which had befallen anselmo and then he read the
paper the handwrit of which he recognis as hi and which
contain these word
a foolish and illadvis desir ha rob me of life if the new of
my death should reach the ear of camilla let her know that i forgiv
her for she wa not bound to perform miracl nor ought i to have
requir her to perform them and sinc i have been the author of my
own dishonour there is no reason why
so far anselmo had written and thu it wa plain that at thi point
befor he could finish what he had to sai hi life came to an end the
next dai hi friend sent intellig of hi death to hi rel
who had alreadi ascertain hi misfortun as well as the convent
where camilla lai almost on the point of accompani her husband on
that inevit journei not on account of the tide of hi death
but becaus of those she receiv of her lover departur although
she saw herself a widow it is said she refus either to quit the
convent or take the veil until not long afterward intellig
reach her that lothario had been kill in a battl in which m de
lautrec had been recent engag with the great captain gonzalo
fernandez de cordova in the kingdom of napl whither her too late
repent lover had repair on learn thi camilla took the veil
and shortli afterward di worn out by grief and melancholi thi wa
the end of all three an end that came of a thoughtless begin
i like thi novel said the curat but i cannot persuad myself of
it truth and if it ha been invent the author invent is
faulti for it is imposs to imagin ani husband so foolish as to

luscinda in her feebl wa on the point of fall to the ground
when don fernando releas her but cardenio who stood near have
retreat behind don fernando to escap recognit cast fear asid

at these word luscinda look up at cardenio at first begin to
recognis him by hi voic and then satisfi herself by her ey that
it wa he and hardli know what she did and heedless of all
consider of decorum she flung her arm around hi neck and
press her face close to hi said ye my dear lord you ar the
true master of thi your slave even though advers fate interpos

that don fernando chang colour and look as though he meant to take
vengeanc on cardenio for she observ him put hi hand to hi sword

clasp him round the knee and kiss them and hold him so as to
prevent hi move she said while her tear continu to flow what
is it thou wouldst do my onli refug in thi unforeseen event thou
hast thy wife at thy feet and she whom thou wouldst have for thy wife
is in the arm of her husband reflect whether it will be right for
thee whether it will be possibl for thee to undo what heaven ha

more influenc than passion
all the time dorothea wa speak cardenio though he held luscinda
in hi arm never took hi ey off don fernando determin if he
saw him make ani hostil movement to try and defend himself and resist
as best he could all who might assail him though it should cost him

could part luscinda from cardenio that even if some sword were to
separ them thei would think their death most happi and that in a
case that admit of no remedi hi wisest cours wa by conquer
and put a constraint upon himself to show a gener mind and of
hi own accord suffer these two to enjoi the happi heaven had
grant them he bade him too turn hi ey upon the beauti of
dorothea and he would see that few if ani could equal much less excel
her while to that beauti should be ad her modesti and the
surpass love she bore him but besid all thi he remind him
that if he pride himself on be a gentleman and a christian he
could not do otherwis than keep hi plight word and that in do
so he would obei god and meet the approv of all sensibl peopl who

humbl birth provid virtu accompani it to be abl to rais itself
to the level of ani rank without ani slur upon him who place it upon

is not to be blame who give wai to it
to be brief thei ad to these such other forcibl argument that don

unconsci of all that had come to pass dorothea wa unabl to
persuad herself that her present happi wa not all a dream
cardenio wa in a similar state of mind and luscinda thought ran in
the same direct don fernando gave thank to heaven for the favour

in which he had been brought so near the destruct of hi good name
and of hi soul and in short everybodi in the inn wa full of
content and satisfact at the happi issu of such a complic

reflect upon the whole affair and congratul each upon hi good
fortun but the on that wa in the highest spirit and good humour

given her to pai for all the loss and damag she had sustain
through don quixot mean sancho as ha been alreadi said wa the

prodigi and stupend battl with the giant that i ever rememb
have had all the dai of my life and with on backstrokeswishi
brought hi head tumbl to the ground and so much blood gush forth
from him that it ran in rivulet over the earth like water
like red wine your worship had better sai repli sancho for i
would have you know if you dont know it that the dead giant is a
hack wineskin and the blood fourandtwenti gallon of red wine
that it had in it belli and the cutoff head is the bitch that bore
me and the devil take it all
what art thou talk about fool said don quixot art thou in thy
sens
let your worship get up said sancho and you will see the nice
busi you have made of it and what we have to pai and you will see
the queen turn into a privat ladi call dorothea and other thing
that will astonish you if you understand them
i shall not be surpris at anyth of the kind return don
quixot for if thou dost rememb the last time we were here i told
thee that everyth that happen here wa a matter of enchant
and it would be no wonder if it were the same now
i could believ all that repli sancho if my blanket wa the
same sort of thing also onli it wasnt but real and genuin for i
saw the landlord who is here todai hold on end of the blanket
and jerk me up to the ski veri neatli and smartli and with as
much laughter as strength and when it come to be a case of know
peopl i hold for my part simpl and sinner as i am that there is no
enchant about it at all but a great deal of bruis and bad
luck
well well god will give a remedi said don quixot hand me my
cloth and let me go out for i want to see these transform and

ladi scorn he describ to them also nearli all the adventur that
sancho had mention at which thei marvel and laugh not a littl
think it as all did the strangest form of mad a crazi
intellect could be capabl of but now the curat said that the ladi
dorothea good fortun prevent her from proceed with their
purpos it would be necessari to devis or discov some other wai of
get him home
cardenio propos to carri out the scheme thei had begun and suggest
that luscinda would act and support dorothea part suffici well
no said don fernando that must not be for i want dorothea to
follow out thi idea of her and if the worthi gentleman villag is
not veri far off i shall be happi if i can do anyth for hi
relief

matter to kill a whelp of a giant howev arrog he mai be for it

the landlord at thi but don fernando told him to hold hi tongu and
on no account interrupt don quixot who continu i sai in
conclus high and disinherit ladi that if your father ha brought

her own countri for which reason she doe not and cannot answer what
ha been ask of her
noth ha been ask of her return luscinda she ha onli been
offer our compani for thi even and a share of the quarter we
occupi where she shall be made as comfort as the circumst
allow with the goodwil we ar bound to show all stranger that stand
in need of it especi if it be a woman to whom the servic is
render
on her part and my own seora repli the captiv i kiss your
hand and i esteem highli as i ought the favour you have offer
which on such an occas and come from person of your appear
is it is plain to see a veri great on
tell me seor said dorothea is thi ladi a christian or a moor
for her dress and her silenc lead us to imagin that she is what we
could wish she wa not
in dress and outwardli said he she is a moor but at heart she is
a thoroughli good christian for she ha the greatest desir to becom
on
then she ha not been baptis return luscinda
there ha been no opportun for that repli the captiv sinc
she left algier her nativ countri and home and up to the present
she ha not found herself in ani such immin danger of death as to
make it necessari to baptis her befor she ha been instruct in all
the ceremoni our holi mother church ordain but pleas god er
long she shall be baptis with the solemn befit her which is
higher than her dress or mine indic
by these word he excit a desir in all who heard him to know who
the moorish ladi and the captiv were but no on like to ask just
then see that it wa a fitter moment for help them to rest
themselv than for question them about their live dorothea took
the moorish ladi by the hand and lead her to a seat besid herself
request her to remov her veil she look at the captiv as if to
ask him what thei meant and what she wa to do he said to her in
arab that thei ask her to take off her veil and thereupon she
remov it and disclos a counten so love that to dorothea she
seem more beauti than luscinda and to luscinda more beauti
than dorothea and all the bystand felt that if ani beauti could
compar with their it wa the moorish ladi and there were even
those who were inclin to give it somewhat the prefer and as it
is the privileg and charm of beauti to win the heart and secur
goodwil all forthwith becam eager to show kind and attent to
the love moor
don fernando ask the captiv what her name wa and he repli that
it wa lela zoraida but the instant she heard him she guess what
the christian had ask and said hastili with some displeasur and
energi no not zoraida maria maria give them to understand that
she wa call maria and not zoraida these word and the touch
earnest with which she utter them drew more than on tear from
some of the listen particularli the women who ar by natur
tenderheart and compassion luscinda embrac her affection
sai ye ye maria maria to which the moor repli ye ye
maria zoraida macang which mean not zoraida
night wa now approach and by the order of those who accompani
don fernando the landlord had taken care and pain to prepar for them
the best supper that wa in hi power the hour therefor have
arriv thei all took their seat at a long tabl like a refectori on
for round or squar tabl there wa none in the inn and the seat of
honour at the head of it though he wa for refus it thei assign
to don quixot who desir the ladi micomicona to place herself by hi
side as he wa her protector luscinda and zoraida took their place
next her opposit to them were don fernando and cardenio and next the
captiv and the other gentlemen and by the side of the ladi the
curat and the barber and so thei sup in high enjoy which wa
increas when thei observ don quixot leav off eat and move
by an impuls like that which made him deliv himself at such length
when he sup with the goatherd begin to address them
verili gentlemen if we reflect upon it great and marvel ar the
thing thei see who make profess of the order of knighterrantri
sai what be is there in thi world who enter the gate of thi
castl at thi moment and see us as we ar here would suppos or
imagin us to be what we ar who would sai that thi ladi who is
besid me wa the great queen that we all know her to be or that i am
that knight of the rueful counten trumpet far and wide by the
mouth of fame now there can be no doubt that thi art and call
surpass all those that mankind ha invent and is the more
deserv of be held in honour in proport as it is the more
expos to peril awai with those who assert that letter have the
preemin over arm i will tell them whosoev thei mai be that
thei know not what thei sai for the reason which such person commonli
assign and upon which thei chiefli rest is that the labour of the
mind ar greater than those of the bodi and that arm give employ
to the bodi alon as if the call were a porter trade for which
noth more is requir than sturdi strength or as if in what we who
profess them call arm there were not includ act of vigour for the
execut of which high intellig is requisit or as if the soul of
the warrior when he ha an armi or the defenc of a citi under hi
care did not exert itself as much by mind as by bodi nai see whether
by bodili strength it be possibl to learn or divin the intent of
the enemi hi plan stratagem or obstacl or to ward off
impend mischief for all these ar the work of the mind and in them
the bodi ha no share whatev sinc therefor arm have need of the
mind as much as letter let us see now which of the two mind that
of the man of letter or that of the warrior ha most to do and thi
will be seen by the end and goal that each seek to attain for that
purpos is the more estim which ha for it aim the nobler object
the end and goal of lettersi am not speak now of divin letter
the aim of which is to rais and direct the soul to heaven for with an
end so infinit no other can be comparedi speak of human letter the
end of which is to establish distribut justic give to everi man
that which is hi and see and take care that good law ar observ
an end undoubtedli nobl lofti and deserv of high prais but not
such as should be given to that sought by arm which have for their
end and object peac the greatest boon that men can desir in thi
life the first good new the world and mankind receiv wa that which
the angel announc on the night that wa our dai when thei sang in
the air glori to god in the highest and peac on earth to men of
goodwil and the salut which the great master of heaven and
earth taught hi discipl and chosen follow when thei enter ani
hous wa to sai peac be on thi hous and mani other time he
said to them my peac i give unto you my peac i leav you peac be
with you a jewel and a preciou gift given and left by such a hand a
jewel without which there can be no happi either on earth or in
heaven thi peac is the true end of war and war is onli anoth name
for arm thi then be admit that the end of war is peac and
that so far it ha the advantag of the end of letter let us turn to
the bodili labour of the man of letter and those of him who follow
the profess of arm and see which ar the greater
don quixot deliv hi discours in such a manner and in such
correct languag that for the time be he made it imposs for ani
of hi hearer to consid him a madman on the contrari as thei were
mostli gentlemen to whom arm ar an appurten by birth thei
listen to him with great pleasur as he continu here then i sai
is what the student ha to undergo first of all poverti not that all
ar poor but to put the case as strongli as possibl and when i have
said that he endur poverti i think noth more need be said about
hi hard fortun for he who is poor ha no share of the good thing of
life thi poverti he suffer from in variou wai hunger or cold or
naked or all togeth but for all that it is not so extrem but
that he get someth to eat though it mai be at somewhat
unseason hour and from the leav of the rich for the greatest
miseri of the student is what thei themselv call go out for
soup and there is alwai some neighbour brazier or hearth for them
which if it doe not warm at least temper the cold to them and
lastli thei sleep comfort at night under a roof i will not go
into other particular as for exampl want of shirt and no
superabund of shoe thin and threadbar garment and gorg
themselv to surfeit in their vorac when good luck ha treat them
to a banquet of some sort by thi road that i have describ rough
and hard stumbl here fall there get up again to fall
again thei reach the rank thei desir and that onc attain we have
seen mani who have pass these syrt and scylla and charybdis as
if born fly on the wing of favour fortun we have seen them i
sai rule and govern the world from a chair their hunger turn
into satieti their cold into comfort their naked into fine
raiment their sleep on a mat into repos in holland and damask the
justli earn reward of their virtu but contrast and compar with
what the warrior undergo all thei have undergon fall far short of

continu hi discours don quixot said as we began in the
student case with poverti and it accompani let us see now if
the soldier is richer and we shall find that in poverti itself there
is no on poorer for he is depend on hi miser pai which come
late or never or els on what he can plunder serious imperil
hi life and conscienc and sometim hi naked will be so great
that a slash doublet serv him for uniform and shirt and in the
depth of winter he ha to defend himself against the inclem of the
weather in the open field with noth better than the breath of hi
mouth which i need not sai come from an empti place must come out
cold contrari to the law of natur to be sure he look forward to
the approach of night to make up for all these discomfort on the bed
that await him which unless by some fault of hi never sin by
be over narrow for he can easili measur out on the ground as he
like and roll himself about in it to hi heart content without ani
fear of the sheet slip awai from him then after all thi
suppos the dai and hour for take hi degre in hi call to have
come suppos the dai of battl to have arriv when thei invest him
with the doctor cap made of lint to mend some bullethol perhap
that ha gone through hi templ or left him with a crippl arm or
leg or if thi doe not happen and merci heaven watch over him
and keep him safe and sound it mai be he will be in the same poverti
he wa in befor and he must go through more engag and more
battl and come victori out of all befor he better himself but
miracl of that sort ar seldom seen for tell me sir if you have
ever reflect upon it by how much do those who have gain by war
fall short of the number of those who have perish in it no doubt you
will repli that there can be no comparison that the dead cannot be
number while the live who have been reward mai be sum up with
three figur all which is the revers in the case of men of letter
for by skirt to sai noth of sleev thei all find mean of
support so that though the soldier ha more to endur hi reward is
much less but against all thi it mai be urg that it is easier to
reward two thousand soldier for the former mai be remuner by
give them place which must perforc be confer upon men of their
call while the latter can onli be recompens out of the veri
properti of the master thei serv but thi imposs onli
strengthen my argument
put thi howev asid for it is a puzzl question for which
it is difficult to find a solut let us return to the superior of
arm over letter a matter still undecid so mani ar the argument
put forward on each side for besid those i have mention letter
sai that without them arm cannot maintain themselv for war too
ha it law and is govern by them and law belong to the domain of
letter and men of letter to thi arm make answer that without them
law cannot be maintain for by arm state ar defend kingdom
preserv citi protect road made safe sea clear of pirat
and in short if it were not for them state kingdom monarchi
citi wai by sea and land would be expos to the violenc and
confus which war bring with it so long as it last and is free to
make us of it privileg and power and then it is plain that
whatev cost most is valu and deserv to be valu most to attain
to emin in letter cost a man time watch hunger naked
headach indigest and other thing of the sort some of which i
have alreadi refer to but for a man to come in the ordinari cours
of thing to be a good soldier cost him all the student suffer and
in an incompar higher degre for at everi step he run the risk of
lose hi life for what dread of want or poverti that can reach or
harass the student can compar with what the soldier feel who find
himself beleagu in some stronghold mount guard in some ravelin
or cavali know that the enemi is push a mine toward the post
where he is station and cannot under ani circumst retir or fly
from the immin danger that threaten him all he can do is to inform
hi captain of what is go on so that he mai try to remedi it by a
countermin and then stand hi ground in fear and expect of the
moment when he will fly up to the cloud without wing and descend into
the deep against hi will and if thi seem a trifl risk let us
see whether it is equal or surpass by the encount of two gallei
stem to stem in the midst of the open sea lock and entangl on
with the other when the soldier ha no more stand room than two
feet of the plank of the spur and yet though he see befor him
threaten him as mani minist of death as there ar cannon of the
foe point at him not a lanc length from hi bodi and see too that
with the first heedless step he will go down to visit the profund
of neptun bosom still with dauntless heart urg on by honour that
nerv him he make himself a target for all that musketri and
struggl to cross that narrow path to the enemi ship and what is
still more marvel no sooner ha on gone down into the depth he
will never rise from till the end of the world than anoth take hi
place and if he too fall into the sea that wait for him like an
enemi anoth and anoth will succe him without a moment paus
between their death courag and dare the greatest that all the
chanc of war can show happi the blest ag that knew not the dread
furi of those devilish engin of artilleri whose inventor i am
persuad is in hell receiv the reward of hi diabol invent
by which he made it easi for a base and cowardli arm to take the life
of a gallant gentleman and that when he know not how or whenc in
the height of the ardour and enthusiasm that fire and anim brave
heart there should come some random bullet discharg perhap by on
who fled in terror at the flash when he fire off hi accurs machin
which in an instant put an end to the project and cut off the life
of on who deserv to live for ag to come and thu when i reflect
on thi i am almost tempt to sai that in my heart i repent of have
adopt thi profess of knighterr in so detest an ag as we
live in now for though no peril can make me fear still it give me
some uneasi to think that powder and lead mai rob me of the
opportun of make myself famou and renown throughout the known
earth by the might of my arm and the edg of my sword but heaven
will be done if i succe in my attempt i shall be all the more
honour as i have face greater danger than the knightserr of
yore expos themselv to
all thi lengthi discours don quixot deliv while the other
sup forget to rais a morsel to hi lip though sancho more
than onc told him to eat hi supper as he would have time enough
afterward to sai all he want it excit fresh piti in those who had

hi wretch unlucki chivalri wa in question the curat told him he

my famili had it origin in a villag in the mountain of leon and
natur had been kinder and more gener to it than fortun though in
the gener poverti of those commun my father pass for be
even a rich man and he would have been so in realiti had he been as
clever in preserv hi properti as he wa in spend it thi
tendenc of hi to be liber and profus he had acquir from have
been a soldier in hi youth for the soldier life is a school in
which the niggard becom freehand and the freehand prodig and
if ani soldier ar to be found who ar miser thei ar monster of
rare occurr my father went beyond liber and border on
prodig a disposit by no mean advantag to a marri man
who ha children to succe to hi name and posit my father had
three all son and all of suffici ag to make choic of a
profess find then that he wa unabl to resist hi propens
he resolv to divest himself of the instrument and caus of hi
prodig and lavish to divest himself of wealth without which
alexand himself would have seem parsimoni and so call us all
three asid on dai into a room he address us in word somewhat to
the follow effect
my son to assur you that i love you no more need be known or said
than that you ar my son and to encourag a suspicion that i do not
love you no more is need than the knowledg that i have no
selfcontrol as far as preserv of your patrimoni is concern
therefor that you mai for the futur feel sure that i love you like a
father and have no wish to ruin you like a stepfath i propos to do
with you what i have for some time back medit and after matur
deliber decid upon you ar now of an ag to choos your line of
life or at least make choic of a call that will bring you honour
and profit when you ar older and what i have resolv to do is to
divid my properti into four part three i will give to you to each
hi portion without make ani differ and the other i will retain
to live upon and support myself for whatev remaind of life heaven
mai be pleas to grant me but i wish each of you on take possess
of the share that fall to him to follow on of the path i shall
indic in thi spain of our there is a proverb to my mind veri
truea thei all ar be short aphor drawn from long practic
experienceand the on i refer to sai the church or the sea or the
king hous as much as to sai in plainer languag whoever want to
flourish and becom rich let him follow the church or go to sea
adopt commerc as hi call or go into the king servic in hi
household for thei sai better a king crumb than a lord favour
i sai so becaus it is my will and pleasur that on of you should
follow letter anoth trade and the third serv the king in the
war for it is a difficult matter to gain admiss to hi servic in
hi household and if war doe not bring much wealth it confer great
distinct and fame eight dai henc i will give you your full share
in monei without defraud you of a farth as you will see in the
end now tell me if you ar will to follow out my idea and advic as
i have laid it befor you
have call upon me as the eldest to answer i after urg him not
to strip himself of hi properti but to spend it all as he pleas for
we were young men abl to gain our live consent to compli with hi
wish and said that mine were to follow the profess of arm and
therebi serv god and my king my second brother have made the same
propos decid upon go to the indi embark the portion that
fell to him in trade the youngest and in my opinion the wisest said
he would rather follow the church or go to complet hi studi at
salamanca as soon as we had come to an understand and made choic
of our profess my father embrac us all and in the short time he
mention carri into effect all he had promis and when he had
given to each hi share which as well as i rememb wa three thousand
ducat apiec in cash for an uncl of our bought the estat and paid
for it down not to let it go out of the famili we all three on the
same dai took leav of our good father and at the same time as it
seem to me inhuman to leav my father with such scanti mean in hi
old ag i induc him to take two of my three thousand ducat as the
remaind would be enough to provid me with all a soldier need my
two brother move by my exampl gave him each a thousand ducat so
that there wa left for my father four thousand ducat in monei
besid three thousand the valu of the portion that fell to him which
he prefer to retain in land instead of sell it final as i
said we took leav of him and of our uncl whom i have mention not
without sorrow and tear on both side thei charg us to let them
know whenev an opportun offer how we fare whether well or ill
we promis to do so and when he had embrac us and given us hi
bless on set out for salamanca the other for sevil and i for
alicant where i had heard there wa a genoes vessel take in a
cargo of wool for genoa
it is now some twentytwo year sinc i left my father hous and all
that time though i have written sever letter i have had no new
whatev of him or of my brother my own adventur dure that period
i will now relat briefli i embark at alicant reach genoa after
a prosper voyag and proceed thenc to milan where i provid
myself with arm and a few soldier accoutr thenc it wa my
intent to go and take servic in piedmont but as i wa alreadi on
the road to alessandria della paglia i learn that the great duke of
alva wa on hi wai to flander i chang my plan join him serv
under him in the campaign he made wa present at the death of the
count egmont and horn and wa promot to be ensign under a famou
captain of guadalajara diego de urbina by name some time after my
arriv in flander new came of the leagu that hi holi pope piu
v of happi memori had made with venic and spain against the common
enemi the turk who had just then with hi fleet taken the famou
island of cypru which belong to the venetian a loss deplor
and disastr it wa known as a fact that the most seren don john of
austria natur brother of our good king don philip wa come as
commanderinchief of the alli forc and rumour were abroad of the
vast warlik prepar which were be made all which stir my
heart and fill me with a long to take part in the campaign which
wa expect and though i had reason to believ and almost certain
promis that on the first opportun that present itself i should
be promot to be captain i prefer to leav all and betak myself
as i did to itali and it wa my good fortun that don john had just
arriv at genoa and wa go on to napl to join the venetian
fleet as he afterward did at messina i mai sai in short that i
took part in that gloriou expedit promot by thi time to be a
captain of infantri to which honour charg my good luck rather
than my merit rais me and that dayso fortun for christendom
becaus then all the nation of the earth were disabus of the error
under which thei lai in imagin the turk to be invinc on seaon
that dai i sai on which the ottoman pride and arrog were broken
among all that were there made happi for the christian who di that
dai were happier than those who remain aliv and victori i alon
wa miser for instead of some naval crown that i might have
expect had it been in roman time on the night that follow that
famou dai i found myself with fetter on my feet and manacl on my
hand
it happen in thi wai el uchali the king of algier a dare and
success corsair have attack and taken the lead maltes
gallei onli three knight be left aliv in it and thei badli
wound the chief gallei of john andrea on board of which i and my
compani were place came to it relief and do as wa bound to do
in such a case i leap on board the enemi gallei which sheer
off from that which had attack it prevent my men from follow
me and so i found myself alon in the midst of my enemi who were in
such number that i wa unabl to resist in short i wa taken cover
with wound el uchali as you know sir made hi escap with hi
entir squadron and i wa left a prison in hi power the onli sad
be among so mani fill with joi and the onli captiv among so mani
free for there were fifteen thousand christian all at the oar in the
turkish fleet that regain their longedfor liberti that dai
thei carri me to constantinopl where the grand turk selim made my
master gener at sea for have done hi duti in the battl and
carri off as evid of hi braveri the standard of the order of
malta the follow year which wa the year seventytwo i found
myself at navarino row in the lead gallei with the three
lantern there i saw and observ how the opportun of captur the
whole turkish fleet in harbour wa lost for all the marin and
janizzari that belong to it made sure that thei were about to be
attack insid the veri harbour and had their kit and pasamaqu or
shoe readi to flee at onc on shore without wait to be assail
in so great fear did thei stand of our fleet but heaven order it
otherwis not for ani fault or neglect of the gener who command on
our side but for the sin of christendom and becaus it wa god
will and pleasur that we should alwai have instrument of punish
to chastis us as it wa el uchali took refug at modon which is an
island near navarino and land forc fortifi the mouth of the
harbour and wait quietli until don john retir on thi expedit
wa taken the gallei call the prize whose captain wa a son of the
famou corsair barbarossa it wa taken by the chief neapolitan gallei
call the shewolf command by that thunderbolt of war that father
of hi men that success and unconqu captain don lvaro de
bazan marqui of santa cruz and i cannot help tell you what took
place at the captur of the prize
the son of barbarossa wa so cruel and treat hi slave so badli
that when those who were at the oar saw that the shewolf gallei wa
bear down upon them and gain upon them thei all at onc drop
their oar and seiz their captain who stood on the stage at the end
of the gangwai shout to them to row lustili and pass him on from
bench to bench from the poop to the prow thei so bit him that befor
he had got much past the mast hi soul had alreadi got to hell so
great as i said wa the cruelti with which he treat them and the
hatr with which thei hate him
we return to constantinopl and the follow year seventythre
it becam known that don john had seiz tuni and taken the kingdom
from the turk and place mulei hamet in possess put an end to
the hope which mulei hamida the cruelest and bravest moor in the
world entertain of return to reign there the grand turk took the
loss greatli to heart and with the cun which all hi race possess
he made peac with the venetian who were much more eager for it than
he wa and the follow year seventyfour he attack the goletta
and the fort which don john had left half built near tuni while all
these event were occur i wa labour at the oar without ani
hope of freedom at least i had no hope of obtain it by ransom for
i wa firmli resolv not to write to my father tell him of my
misfortun at length the goletta fell and the fort fell befor
which place there were seventyf thousand regular turkish soldier
and more than four hundr thousand moor and arab from all part of
africa and in the train of all thi great host such munit and
engin of war and so mani pioneer that with their hand thei might
have cover the goletta and the fort with hand of earth the first
to fall wa the goletta until then reckon impregn and it fell
not by ani fault of it defend who did all that thei could and
should have done but becaus experi prove how easili
entrench could be made in the desert sand there for water us to
be found at two palm depth while the turk found none at two yard
and so by mean of a quantiti of sandbag thei rais their work so
high that thei command the wall of the fort sweep them as if
from a cavali so that no on wa abl to make a stand or maintain
the defenc
it wa a common opinion that our men should not have shut themselv up
in the goletta but should have wait in the open at the
landingplac but those who sai so talk at random and with littl
knowledg of such matter for if in the goletta and in the fort there
were bare seven thousand soldier how could such a small number
howev resolut salli out and hold their own against number like
those of the enemi and how is it possibl to help lose a stronghold
that is not reliev abov all when surround by a host of determin
enemi in their own countri but mani thought and i thought so too
that it wa special favour and merci which heaven show to spain in
permit the destruct of that sourc and hide place of mischief
that devour spong and moth of countless monei fruitlessli wast
there to no other purpos save preserv the memori of it captur by
the invinc charl v as if to make that etern as it is and
will be these stone were need to support it the fort also fell
but the turk had to win it inch by inch for the soldier who defend
it fought so gallantli and stoutli that the number of the enemi kill
in twentytwo gener assault exceed twentyf thousand of three
hundr that remain aliv not on wa taken unwound a clear and
manifest proof of their gallantri and resolut and how sturdili thei
had defend themselv and held their post a small fort or tower
which wa in the middl of the lagoon under the command of don juan
zanoguera a valencian gentleman and a famou soldier capitul upon
term thei took prison don pedro puertocarrero command of the
goletta who had done all in hi power to defend hi fortress and took
the loss of it so much to heart that he di of grief on the wai to
constantinopl where thei were carri him a prison thei also took
the command of the fort gabrio cerbellon by name a milanes
gentleman a great engin and a veri brave soldier in these two
fortress perish mani person of note among whom wa pagano doria
knight of the order of st john a man of gener disposit as wa
shown by hi extrem liber to hi brother the famou john andrea

order to dismantl the golettafor the fort wa reduc to such a

greatest eas final the fleet return victori and triumphant to
constantinopl and a few month later di my master el uchali
otherwis uchali fartax which mean in turkish the scabbi renegad
for that he wa it is the practic with the turk to name peopl from
some defect or virtu thei mai possess the reason be that there ar
among them onli four surnam belong to famili trace their
descent from the ottoman hous and the other as i have said take
their name and surnam either from bodili blemish or moral
qualiti thi scabbi on row at the oar as a slave of the grand
signor for fourteen year and when over thirtyfour year of ag in
resent at have been struck by a turk while at the oar turn
renegad and renounc hi faith in order to be abl to reveng
himself and such wa hi valour that without ow hi advanc to
the base wai and mean by which most favourit of the grand signor
rise to power he came to be king of algier and afterward
generalonsea which is the third place of trust in the realm he wa
a calabrian by birth and a worthi man moral and he treat hi
slave with great human he had three thousand of them and after
hi death thei were divid as he direct by hi will between the
grand signor who is heir of all who die and share with the children
of the deceas and hi renegad i fell to the lot of a venetian
renegad who when a cabin boi on board a ship had been taken by
uchali and wa so much belov by him that he becam on of hi most
favour youth he came to be the most cruel renegad i ever saw hi
name wa hassan aga and he grew veri rich and becam king of algier
with him i went there from constantinopl rather glad to be so near
spain not that i intend to write to anyon about my unhappi lot but
to try if fortun would be kinder to me in algier than in
constantinopl where i had attempt in a thousand wai to escap
without ever find a favour time or chanc but in algier i
resolv to seek for other mean of effect the purpos i cherish
so dearli for the hope of obtain my liberti never desert me and
when in my plot and scheme and attempt the result did not answer my
expect without give wai to despair i immedi began to look
out for or conjur up some new hope to support me howev faint or
feebl it might be
in thi wai i live on immur in a build or prison call by the
turk a bao in which thei confin the christian captiv as well
those that ar the king as those belong to privat individu
and also what thei call those of the almacen which is as much as to
sai the slave of the municip who serv the citi in the public
work and other employ but captiv of thi kind recov their
liberti with great difficulti for as thei ar public properti and
have no particular master there is no on with whom to treat for their
ransom even though thei mai have the mean to these bao as i have
said some privat individu of the town ar in the habit of bring
their captiv especi when thei ar to be ransom becaus there
thei can keep them in safeti and comfort until their ransom arriv
the king captiv also that ar on ransom do not go out to work
with the rest of the crew unless when their ransom is delai for
then to make them write for it more pressingli thei compel them to
work and go for wood which is no light labour
i howev wa on of those on ransom for when it wa discov that
i wa a captain although i declar my scanti mean and want of
fortun noth could dissuad them from includ me among the
gentlemen and those wait to be ransom thei put a chain on me
more as a mark of thi than to keep me safe and so i pass my life in
that bao with sever other gentlemen and person of qualiti mark
out as held to ransom but though at time or rather almost alwai we
suffer from hunger and scanti cloth noth distress us so much
as hear and see at everi turn the unexampl and unheardof
cruelti my master inflict upon the christian everi dai he hang
a man impal on cut off the ear of anoth and all with so littl
provoc or so entir without ani that the turk acknowledg he
did it mere for the sake of do it and becaus he wa by natur
murder dispos toward the whole human race the onli on that
fare at all well with him wa a spanish soldier someth de saavedra
by name to whom he never gave a blow himself or order a blow to be
given or address a hard word although he had done thing that will
dwell in the memori of the peopl there for mani a year and all to
recov hi liberti and for the least of the mani thing he did we all
dread that he would be impal and he himself wa in fear of it more
than onc and onli that time doe not allow i could tell you now
someth of what that soldier did that would interest and astonish
you much more than the narrat of my own tale
to go on with my stori the courtyard of our prison wa overlook by
the window of the hous belong to a wealthi moor of high posit
and these as is usual in moorish hous were rather loophol than
window and besid were cover with thick and close latticework it
so happen then that as i wa on dai on the terrac of our prison
with three other comrad try to pass awai the time how far we
could leap with our chain we be alon for all the other
christian had gone out to work i chanc to rais my ey and from
on of these littl close window i saw a reed appear with a cloth
attach to the end of it and it kept wave to and fro and move as
if make sign to us to come and take it we watch it and on of
those who were with me went and stood under the reed to see whether
thei would let it drop or what thei would do but as he did so the
reed wa rais and move from side to side as if thei meant to sai
no by a shake of the head the christian came back and it wa again
lower make the same movement as befor anoth of my comrad
went and with him the same happen as with the first and then the
third went forward but with the same result as the first and second
see thi i did not like not to try my luck and as soon as i came
under the reed it wa drop and fell insid the bao at my feet i
hasten to unti the cloth in which i perceiv a knot and in thi
were ten ciani which ar coin of base gold current among the moor
and each worth ten real of our monei
it is needless to sai i rejoic over thi godsend and my joi wa not
less than my wonder as i strove to imagin how thi good fortun could
have come to us but to me special for the evid unwilling to
drop the reed for ani but me show that it wa for me the favour wa
intend i took my welcom monei broke the reed and return to the
terrac and look up at the window i saw a veri white hand put out
that open and shut veri quickli from thi we gather or fanci
that it must be some woman live in that hous that had done us thi
kind and to show that we were grate for it we made salaam
after the fashion of the moor bow the head bend the bodi and
cross the arm on the breast shortli afterward at the same window
a small cross made of reed wa put out and immedi withdrawn thi
sign led us to believ that some christian woman wa a captiv in the
hous and that it wa she who had been so good to us but the
white of the hand and the bracelet we had perceiv made us
dismiss that idea though we thought it might be on of the christian
renegad whom their master veri often take as law wive and
gladli for thei prefer them to the women of their own nation in all
our conjectur we were wide of the truth so from that time forward
our sole occup wa watch and gaze at the window where the
cross had appear to us as if it were our polestar but at least
fifteen dai pass without our see either it or the hand or ani
other sign and though meanwhil we endeavour with the utmost pain to
ascertain who it wa that live in the hous and whether there were
ani christian renegad in it nobodi could ever tell us anyth more
than that he who live there wa a rich moor of high posit hadji
morato by name formerli alcaid of la pata an offic of high digniti
among them but when we least thought it wa go to rain ani more
ciani from that quarter we saw the reed suddenli appear with anoth
cloth ti in a larger knot attach to it and thi at a time when as
on the former occas the bao wa desert and unoccupi

we made trial as befor each of the same three go forward befor i
did but the reed wa deliv to none but me and on my approach it
wa let drop i unti the knot and i found forti spanish gold crown
with a paper written in arab and at the end of the write there wa
a larg cross drawn i kiss the cross took the crown and return
to the terrac and we all made our salaam again the hand appear i
made sign that i would read the paper and then the window wa close
we were all puzzl though fill with joi at what had taken place
and as none of us understood arab great wa our curios to know
what the paper contain and still greater the difficulti of find
someon to read it at last i resolv to confid in a renegad a
nativ of murcia who profess a veri great friendship for me and had
given pledg that bound him to keep ani secret i might entrust to him
for it is the custom with some renegad when thei intend to return to
christian territori to carri about them certif from captiv of
mark testifi in whatev form thei can that such and such a
renegad is a worthi man who ha alwai shown kind to christian
and is anxiou to escap on the first opportun that mai present
itself some obtain these testimoni with good intent other put
them to a cun us for when thei go to pillag on christian
territori if thei chanc to be cast awai or taken prison thei
produc their certif and sai that from these paper mai be seen
the object thei came for which wa to remain on christian ground and
that it wa to thi end thei join the turk in their forai in thi
wai thei escap the consequ of the first outburst and make their
peac with the church befor it doe them ani harm and then when thei
have the chanc thei return to barbari to becom what thei were befor
other howev there ar who procur these paper and make us of
them honestli and remain on christian soil thi friend of mine then
wa on of these renegad that i have describ he had certif
from all our comrad in which we testifi in hi favour as strongli
as we could and if the moor had found the paper thei would have
burn him aliv
i knew that he understood arab veri well and could not onli speak
but also write it but befor i disclos the whole matter to him i
ask him to read for me thi paper which i had found by accid in a
hole in my cell he open it and remain some time examin it and
mutter to himself as he translat it i ask him if he understood
it and he told me he did perfectli well and that if i wish him to
tell me it mean word for word i must give him pen and ink that he
might do it more satisfactorili we at onc gave him what he requir
and he set about translat it bit by bit and when he had done he
said
all that is here in spanish is what the moorish paper contain and
you must bear in mind that when it sai lela marien it mean our
ladi the virgin mari
we read the paper and it ran thu
when i wa a child my father had a slave who taught me to prai the
christian prayer in my own languag and told me mani thing about lela
marien the christian di and i know that she did not go to the fire
but to allah becaus sinc then i have seen her twice and she told me
to go to the land of the christian to see lela marien who had great
love for me i know not how to go i have seen mani christian but
except thyself none ha seem to me to be a gentleman i am young and
beauti and have plenti of monei to take with me see if thou canst
contriv how we mai go and if thou wilt thou shalt be my husband
there and if thou wilt not it will not distress me for lela marien
will find me someon to marri me i myself have written thi have a
care to whom thou givest it to read trust no moor for thei ar all
perfidi i am greatli troubl on thi account for i would not have
thee confid in anyon becaus if my father knew it he would at onc
fling me down a well and cover me with stone i will put a thread to
the reed tie the answer to it and if thou hast no on to write for
thee in arab tell it to me by sign for lela marien will make me
understand thee she and allah and thi cross which i often kiss as
the captiv bade me protect thee
judg sir whether we had reason for surpris and joi at the word of
thi paper and both on and the other were so great that the renegad
perceiv that the paper had not been found by chanc but had been in
realiti address to someon of us and he beg us if what he
suspect were the truth to trust him and tell him all for he would
risk hi life for our freedom and so sai he took out from hi
breast a metal crucifix and with mani tear swore by the god the imag
repres in whom sin and wick as he wa he truli and
faithfulli believ to be loyal to us and keep secret whatev we
chose to reveal to him for he thought and almost foresaw that by mean
of her who had written that paper he and all of us would obtain our
liberti and he himself obtain the object he so much desir hi
restor to the bosom of the holi mother church from which by hi
own sin and ignor he wa now sever like a corrupt limb the
renegad said thi with so mani tear and such sign of repent
that with on consent we all agre to tell him the whole truth of the
matter and so we gave him a full account of all without hide
anyth from him we point out to him the window at which the reed
appear and he by that mean took note of the hous and resolv to
ascertain with particular care who live in it we agre also that it
would be advis to answer the moorish ladi letter and the
renegad without a moment delai took down the word i dictat to
him which were exactli what i shall tell you for noth of
import that took place in thi affair ha escap my memori or
ever will while life last thi then wa the answer return to the
moorish ladi
the true allah protect thee ladi and that bless marien who is the
true mother of god and who ha put it into thy heart to go to the land
of the christian becaus she love thee entreat her that she be
pleas to show thee how thou canst execut the command she give thee
for she will such is her good on my own part and on that of all
these christian who ar with me i promis to do all that we can for
thee even to death fail not to write to me and inform me what thou
dost mean to do and i will alwai answer thee for the great allah ha
given us a christian captiv who can speak and write thy languag well
as thou mayest see by thi paper without fear therefor thou canst
inform us of all thou wouldst as to what thou sayest that if thou
dost reach the land of the christian thou wilt be my wife i give thee
my promis upon it as a good christian and know that the christian
keep their promis better than the moor allah and marien hi mother
watch over thee my ladi
the paper be written and fold i wait two dai until the bao wa
empti as befor and immedi repair to the usual walk on the
terrac to see if there were ani sign of the reed which wa not long
in make it appear as soon as i saw it although i could not
distinguish who put it out i show the paper as a sign to attach the
thread but it wa alreadi fix to the reed and to it i ti the
paper and shortli afterward our star onc more made it appear
with the white flag of peac the littl bundl it wa drop and i
pick it up and found in the cloth in gold and silver coin of all
sort more than fifti crown which fifti time more strengthen our
joi and doubl our hope of gain our liberti that veri night our
renegad return and said he had learn that the moor we had been
told of live in that hous that hi name wa hadji morato that he
wa enorm rich that he had on onli daughter the heiress of all
hi wealth and that it wa the gener opinion throughout the citi
that she wa the most beauti woman in barbari and that sever of
the viceroi who came there had sought her for a wife but that she had
been alwai unwil to marri and he had learn moreov that she
had a christian slave who wa now dead all which agre with the
content of the paper we immedi took counsel with the renegad as
to what mean would have to be adopt in order to carri off the
moorish ladi and bring us all to christian territori and in the end it
wa agre that for the present we should wait for a second
commun from zoraida for that wa the name of her who now
desir to be call maria becaus we saw clearli that she and no on
els could find a wai out of all these difficulti when we had
decid upon thi the renegad told us not to be uneasi for he would
lose hi life or restor us to liberti for four dai the bao wa
fill with peopl for which reason the reed delai it appear
for four dai but at the end of that time when the bao wa as it
gener wa empti it appear with the cloth so bulki that it
promis a happi birth reed and cloth came down to me and i found
anoth paper and a hundr crown in gold without ani other coin the
renegad wa present and in our cell we gave him the paper to read
which wa to thi effect
i cannot think of a plan seor for our go to spain nor ha lela
marien shown me on though i have ask her all that can be done is
for me to give you plenti of monei in gold from thi window with it
ransom yourself and your friend and let on of you go to the land of
the christian and there bui a vessel and come back for the other
and he will find me in my father garden which is at the babazon gate
near the seashor where i shall be all thi summer with my father and
my servant you can carri me awai from there by night without ani
danger and bring me to the vessel and rememb thou art to be my
husband els i will prai to marien to punish thee if thou canst not
trust anyon to go for the vessel ransom thyself and do thou go for i
know thou wilt return more sure than ani other as thou art a
gentleman and a christian endeavour to make thyself acquaint with
the garden and when i see thee walk yonder i shall know that the
bao is empti and i will give thee abund of monei allah protect
thee seor
these were the word and content of the second paper and on hear
them each declar himself will to be the ransom on and
promis to go and return with scrupul good faith and i too made
the same offer but to all thi the renegad object sai that he
would not on ani account consent to on be set free befor all went
togeth as experi had taught him how ill those who have been set
free keep promis which thei made in captiv for captiv of
distinct frequent had recours to thi plan pai the ransom of
on who wa to go to valencia or majorca with monei to enabl him to
arm a bark and return for the other who had ransom him but who
never came back for recov liberti and the dread of lose it again
effac from the memori all the oblig in the world and to prove
the truth of what he said he told us briefli what had happen to a
certain christian gentleman almost at that veri time the strangest
case that had ever occur even there where astonish and
marvel thing ar happen everi instant in short he end by
sai that what could and ought to be done wa to give the monei
intend for the ransom of on of us christian to him so that he
might with it bui a vessel there in algier under the pretenc of
becom a merchant and trader at tetuan and along the coast and when
master of the vessel it would be easi for him to hit on some wai of
get us all out of the bao and put us on board especi if
the moorish ladi gave as she said monei enough to ransom all becaus
onc free it would be the easiest thing in the world for us to embark
even in open dai but the greatest difficulti wa that the moor do not
allow ani renegad to bui or own ani craft unless it be a larg vessel
for go on rove expedit becaus thei ar afraid that anyon
who bui a small vessel especi if he be a spaniard onli want it
for the purpos of escap to christian territori thi howev he
could get over by arrang with a tagarin moor to go share with him
in the purchas of the vessel and in the profit on the cargo and
under cover of thi he could becom master of the vessel in which case
he look upon all the rest as accomplish but though to me and my
comrad it had seem a better plan to send to majorca for the vessel
as the moorish ladi suggest we did not dare to oppos him fear
that if we did not do as he said he would denounc us and place us in
danger of lose all our live if he were to disclos our deal with
zoraida for whose life we would have all given our own we therefor
resolv to put ourselv in the hand of god and in the renegad
and at the same time an answer wa given to zoraida tell her that
we would do all she recommend for she had given as good advic as if
lela marien had deliv it and that it depend on her alon whether
we were to defer the busi or put it in execut at onc i renew
my promis to be her husband and thu the next dai that the bao
chanc to be empti she at differ time gave us by mean of the reed
and cloth two thousand gold crown and a paper in which she said that
the next juma that is to sai fridai she wa go to her father
garden but that befor she went she would give us more monei and if
it were not enough we were to let her know as she would give us as
much as we ask for her father had so much he would not miss it and
besid she kept all the kei
we at onc gave the renegad five hundr crown to bui the vessel and
with eight hundr i ransom myself give the monei to a valencian
merchant who happen to be in algier at the time and who had me
releas on hi word pledg it that on the arriv of the first ship
from valencia he would pai my ransom for if he had given the monei at
onc it would have made the king suspect that my ransom monei had been
for a long time in algier and that the merchant had for hi own
advantag kept it secret in fact my master wa so difficult to deal
with that i dare not on ani account pai down the monei at onc the
thursdai befor the fridai on which the fair zoraida wa to go to the
garden she gave us a thousand crown more and warn us of her
departur beg me if i were ransom to find out her father
garden at onc and by all mean to seek an opportun of go there
to see her i answer in a few word that i would do so and that she
must rememb to commend us to lela marien with all the prayer the
captiv had taught her thi have been done step were taken to
ransom our three comrad so as to enabl them to quit the bao and
lest see me ransom and themselv not though the monei wa
forthcom thei should make a disturb about it and the devil
should prompt them to do someth that might injur zoraida for
though their posit might be suffici to reliev me from thi
apprehens nevertheless i wa unwil to run ani risk in the
matter and so i had them ransom in the same wai as i wa hand
over all the monei to the merchant so that he might with safeti and
confid give secur without howev confid our arrang
and secret to him which might have been danger

make as he did a voyag to a place call shershel twenti leagu
from algier on the oran side where there is an extens trade in
dri fig two or three time he made thi voyag in compani with the
tagarin alreadi mention the moor of aragon ar call tagarin in

call the mudjar elch and thei ar the peopl the king chiefli
emploi in war to proce everi time he pass with hi vessel he
anchor in a cove that wa not two crossbow shot from the garden
where zoraida wa wait and there the renegad togeth with the
two moorish lad that row us purpos to station himself either
go through hi prayer or els practis as a part what he meant
to perform in earnest and thu he would go to zoraida garden and ask
for fruit which her father gave him not know him but though as
he afterward told me he sought to speak to zoraida and tell her who
he wa and that by my order he wa to take her to the land of the
christian so that she might feel satisfi and easi he had never
been abl to do so for the moorish women do not allow themselv to be
seen by ani moor or turk unless their husband or father bid them with
christian captiv thei permit freedom of intercours and
commun even more than might be consid proper but for my
part i should have been sorri if he had spoken to her for perhap it
might have alarm her to find her affair talk of by renegad but
god who order it otherwis afford no opportun for our
renegad wellmeant purpos and he see how safe he could go to
shershel and return and anchor when and how and where he like and
that the tagarin hi partner had no will but hi and that now i wa
ransom all we want wa to find some christian to row told me to
look out for ani i should be will to take with me over and abov
those who had been ransom and to engag them for the next fridai
which he fix upon for our departur on thi i spoke to twelv
spaniard all stout rower and such as could most easili leav the
citi but it wa no easi matter to find so mani just then becaus
there were twenti ship out on a cruis and thei had taken all the
rower with them and these would not have been found were it not that
their master remain at home that summer without go to sea in order
to finish a galliot that he had upon the stock to these men i said
noth more than that the next fridai in the even thei were to come
out stealthili on by on and hang about hadji morato garden wait
for me there until i came these direct i gave each on separ
with order that if thei saw ani other christian there thei were not
to sai anyth to them except that i had direct them to wait at that
spot
thi preliminari have been settl anoth still more necessari step
had to be taken which wa to let zoraida know how matter stood that
she might be prepar and forewarn so as not to be taken by surpris
if we were suddenli to seiz upon her befor she thought the
christian vessel could have return i determin therefor to go
to the garden and try if i could speak to her and the dai befor my
departur i went there under the pretenc of gather herb the first
person i met wa her father who address me in the languag that all
over barbari and even in constantinopl is the medium between captiv
and moor and is neither morisco nor castilian nor of ani other
nation but a mixtur of all languag by mean of which we can all
understand on anoth in thi sort of languag i sai he ask me
what i want in hi garden and to whom i belong i repli that i
wa a slave of the arnaut mami for i knew as a certainti that he wa a
veri great friend of hi and that i want some herb to make a
salad he ask me then whether i were on ransom or not and what my
master demand for me while these question and answer were
proceed the fair zoraida who had alreadi perceiv me some time
befor came out of the hous in the garden and as moorish women ar
by no mean particular about let themselv be seen by christian
or as i have said befor at all coi she had no hesit in come
to where her father stood with me moreov her father see her
approach slowli call to her to come it would be beyond my power
now to describ to you the great beauti the highbr air the
brilliant attir of my belov zoraida as she present herself befor
my ey i will content myself with sai that more pearl hung from
her fair neck her ear and her hair than she had hair on her head
on her ankl which as is customari were bare she had carcaj for
so bracelet or anklet ar call in morisco of the purest gold set
with so mani diamond that she told me afterward her father valu
them at ten thousand doubloon and those she had on her wrist were
worth as much more the pearl were in profus and veri fine for the
highest displai and adorn of the moorish women is deck
themselv with rich pearl and seedpearl and of these there ar
therefor more among the moor than among ani other peopl zoraida
father had to the reput of possess a great number and the
purest in all algier and of possess also more than two hundr
thousand spanish crown and she who is now mistress of me onli wa
mistress of all thi whether thu adorn she would have been
beauti or not and what she must have been in her prosper mai be
imagin from the beauti remain to her after so mani hardship for
as everyon know the beauti of some women ha it time and it
season and is increas or diminish by chanc caus and natur
the emot of the mind will heighten or impair it though inde more
frequent thei total destroi it in a word she present herself
befor me that dai attir with the utmost splendour and suprem
beauti at ani rate she seem to me the most beauti object i
had ever seen and when besid i thought of all i ow to her i felt
as though i had befor me some heavenli be come to earth to bring me
relief and happi
as she approach her father told her in hi own languag that i wa a
captiv belong to hi friend the arnaut mami and that i had come
for salad
she took up the convers and in that mixtur of tongu i have
spoken of she ask me if i wa a gentleman and why i wa not

i answer that i wa alreadi ransom and that by the price it might
be seen what valu my master set on me as thei had given on thousand
five hundr zoltani for me to which she repli hadst thou been my
father i can tell thee i would not have let him part with thee for
twice as much for you christian alwai tell li about yourselv and
make yourselv out poor to cheat the moor
that mai be ladi said i but inde i dealt truthfulli with my
master as i do and mean to do with everybodi in the world
and when dost thou go said zoraida
tomorrow i think said i for there is a vessel here from franc
which sail tomorrow and i think i shall go in her
would it not be better said zoraida to wait for the arriv of
ship from spain and go with them and not with the french who ar not
your friend
no said i though if there were intellig that a vessel were now
come from spain it is true i might perhap wait for it howev it
is more like i shall depart tomorrow for the long i feel to
return to my countri and to those i love is so great that it will not
allow me to wait for anoth opportun howev more conveni if
it be delai
no doubt thou art marri in thine own countri said zoraida and
for that reason thou art anxiou to go and see thy wife
i am not marri i repli but i have given my promis to marri on
my arriv there

christian she must be veri beauti if she is like my daughter who
is the most beauti woman in all thi kingdom onli look at her well
and thou wilt see i am tell the truth
zoraida father as the better linguist help to interpret most of
these word and phrase for though she spoke the bastard languag
that as i have said is emploi there she express her mean more
by sign than by word
while we were still engag in thi convers a moor came run
up exclaim that four turk had leap over the fenc or wall of the
garden and were gather the fruit though it wa not yet ripe the
old man wa alarm and zoraida too for the moor commonli and so to
speak instinct have a dread of the turk but particularli of the
soldier who ar so insol and domin to the moor who ar
under their power that thei treat them wors than if thei were their
slave her father said to zoraida daughter retir into the hous
and shut thyself in while i go and speak to these dog and thou
christian pick thy herb and go in peac and allah bring thee safe
to thy own countri
i bow and he went awai to look for the turk leav me alon with
zoraida who made as if she were about to retir as her father bade

step to move toward the hous but as fate would have it and it
might have been veri unfortun if heaven had not otherwis order

describ with her arm round my neck her father as he return after

that he saw us but zoraida readi and quickwit took care not to
remov her arm from my neck but on the contrari drew closer to me and
laid her head on my breast bend her knee a littl and show all
the sign and token of faint while i at the same time made it seem
as though i were support her against my will her father came

to the renegad and my comrad and look forward with impati to
the hour when all fear at an end i should find myself in possess
of the prize which fortun held out to me in the fair and love
zoraida the time pass at length and the appoint dai we so long
for arriv and all follow out the arrang and plan which
after care consider and mani a long discuss we had decid
upon we succeed as fulli as we could have wish for on the fridai
follow the dai upon which i spoke to zoraida in the garden the
renegad anchor hi vessel at nightfal almost opposit the spot
where she wa the christian who were to row were readi and in hide
in differ place round about all wait for me anxiou and
elat and eager to attack the vessel thei had befor their ey for
thei did not know the renegad plan but expect that thei were to
gain their liberti by forc of arm and by kill the moor who were
on board the vessel as soon then as i and my comrad made our
appear all those that were in hide see us came and join us
it wa now the time when the citi gate ar shut and there wa no on
to be seen in all the space outsid when we were collect togeth we
debat whether it would be better first to go for zoraida or to make
prison of the moorish rower who row in the vessel but while we
were still uncertain our renegad came up ask us what kept us as it
wa now the time and all the moor were off their guard and most of
them asleep we told him why we hesit but he said it wa of more
import first to secur the vessel which could be done with the
greatest eas and without ani danger and then we could go for zoraida
we all approv of what he said and so without further delai guid
by him we made for the vessel and he leap on board first drew hi
cutlass and said in morisco let no on stir from thi if he doe not
want it to cost him hi life by thi almost all the christian were
on board and the moor who were faintheart hear their captain
speak in thi wai were cow and without ani on of them take to
hi arm and inde thei had few or hardli ani thei submit without
sai a word to be bound by the christian who quickli secur them
threaten them that if thei rais ani kind of outcri thei would be
all put to the sword thi have been accomplish and half of our
parti be left to keep guard over them the rest of us again take
the renegad as our guid hasten toward hadji morato garden and
as good luck would have it on try the gate it open as easili as
if it had not been lock and so quit quietli and in silenc we
reach the hous without be perceiv by anybodi the love
zoraida wa watch for us at a window and as soon as she perceiv
that there were peopl there she ask in a low voic if we were
nizarani as much as to sai or ask if we were christian i answer
that we were and beg her to come down as soon as she recognis me
she did not delai an instant but without answer a word came down
immedi open the door and present herself befor us all so
beauti and so richli attir that i cannot attempt to describ her
the moment i saw her i took her hand and kiss it and the renegad
and my two comrad did the same and the rest who knew noth of the
circumst did as thei saw us do for it onli seem as if we were
return thank to her and recognis her as the giver of our
liberti the renegad ask her in the morisco languag if her father
wa in the hous she repli that he wa and that he wa asleep
then it will be necessari to waken him and take him with us said the
renegad and everyth of valu in thi fair mansion
nai said she my father must not on ani account be touch and
there is noth in the hous except what i shall take and that will
be quit enough to enrich and satisfi all of you wait a littl and you
shall see and so sai she went in tell us she would return
immedi and bid us keep quiet without make ani nois
i ask the renegad what had pass between them and when he told me
i declar that noth should be done except in accord with the
wish of zoraida who now came back with a littl trunk so full of
gold crown that she could scarc carri it unfortun her father
awok while thi wa go on and hear a nois in the garden came
to the window and at onc perceiv that all those who were there
were christian rais a prodigi loud outcri he began to call
out in arab christian christian thiev thiev by which
cri we were all thrown into the greatest fear and embarrass but
the renegad see the danger we were in and how import it wa for
him to effect hi purpos befor we were heard mount with the utmost
quick to where hadji morato wa and with him went some of our
parti i howev did not dare to leav zoraida who had fallen almost
faint in my arm to be brief those who had gone upstair act so
promptli that in an instant thei came down carri hadji morato with
hi hand bound and a napkin ti over hi mouth which prevent him
from utter a word warn him at the same time that to attempt to
speak would cost him hi life when hi daughter caught sight of him
she cover her ey so as not to see him and her father wa
horrorstricken not know how willingli she had place herself in
our hand but it wa now most essenti for us to be on the move and
carefulli and quickli we regain the vessel where those who had
remain on board were wait for us in apprehens of some mishap
have befallen us it wa bare two hour after night set in when we
were all on board the vessel where the cord were remov from the
hand of zoraida father and the napkin from hi mouth but the
renegad onc more told him not to utter a word or thei would take hi
life he when he saw hi daughter there began to sigh piteous and
still more when he perceiv that i held her close embrac and that
she lai quiet without resist or complain or show ani
reluct nevertheless he remain silent lest thei should carri into
effect the repeat threat the renegad had address to him
find herself now on board and that we were about to give wai with
the oar zoraida see her father there and the other moor bound
bade the renegad ask me to do her the favour of releas the moor
and set her father at liberti for she would rather drown herself
in the sea than suffer a father that had love her so dearli to be
carri awai captiv befor her ey and on her account the renegad
repeat thi to me and i repli that i wa veri will to do so
but he repli that it wa not advis becaus if thei were left
there thei would at onc rais the countri and stir up the citi and
lead to the despatch of swift cruiser in pursuit and our be taken
by sea or land without ani possibl of escap and that all that
could be done wa to set them free on the first christian ground we
reach on thi point we all agre and zoraida to whom it wa
explain togeth with the reason that prevent us from do at
onc what she desir wa satisfi likewis and then in glad silenc
and with cheer alacr each of our stout rower took hi oar and
commend ourselv to god with all our heart we began to shape our
cours for the island of majorca the nearest christian land ow
howev to the tramontana rise a littl and the sea grow
somewhat rough it wa imposs for us to keep a straight cours for
majorca and we were compel to coast in the direct of oran not
without great uneasi on our part lest we should be observ from
the town of shershel which li on that coast not more than sixti
mile from algier moreov we were afraid of meet on that cours
on of the galliot that usual come with good from tetuan although
each of us for himself and all of us togeth felt confid that if
we were to meet a merchant galliot so that it were not a cruiser not
onli should we not be lost but that we should take a vessel in which
we could more safe accomplish our voyag as we pursu our cours
zoraida kept her head between my hand so as not to see her father and
i felt that she wa prai to lela marien to help us

we might have made about thirti mile when daybreak found us some three
musketshot off the land which seem to us desert and without
anyon to see us for all that howev by hard row we put out a
littl to sea for it wa now somewhat calmer and have gain about
two leagu the word wa given to row by batch while we at
someth for the vessel wa well provid but the rower said it wa
not a time to take ani rest let food be serv out to those who were
not row but thei would not leav their oar on ani account thi
wa done but now a stiff breez began to blow which oblig us to
leav off row and make sail at onc and steer for oran as it wa
imposs to make ani other cours all thi wa done veri promptli
and under sail we ran more than eight mile an hour without ani fear
except that of come across some vessel out on a rove expedit we
gave the moorish rower some food and the renegad comfort them by
tell them that thei were not held as captiv as we should set them
free on the first opportun
the same wa said to zoraida father who repli anyth els
christian i might hope for or think like from your generos and
good behaviour but do not think me so simpl as to imagin you will
give me my liberti for you would have never expos yourselv to the
danger of depriv me of it onli to restor it to me so gener
especi as you know who i am and the sum you mai expect to receiv
on restor it and if you will onli name that i here offer you all
you requir for myself and for my unhappi daughter there or els for
her alon for she is the greatest and most preciou part of my soul
as he said thi he began to weep so bitterli that he fill us all with
compass and forc zoraida to look at him and when she saw him
weep she wa so move that she rose from my feet and ran to throw
her arm round him and press her face to hi thei both gave wai to
such an outburst of tear that sever of us were constrain to keep
them compani
but when her father saw her in full dress and with all her jewel about
her he said to her in hi own languag what mean thi my daughter
last night befor thi terribl misfortun in which we ar plung
befel us i saw thee in thy everydai and indoor garment and now
without have had time to attir thyself and without my bring thee
ani joy tide to furnish an occas for adorn and bedeck
thyself i see thee arrai in the finest attir it would be in my
power to give thee when fortun wa most kind to us answer me thi
for it caus me greater anxieti and surpris than even thi misfortun
itself
the renegad interpret to us what the moor said to hi daughter she
howev return him no answer but when he observ in on corner of
the vessel the littl trunk in which she us to keep her jewel which
he well knew he had left in algier and had not brought to the garden
he wa still more amaz and ask her how that trunk had come into
our hand and what there wa in it to which the renegad without
wait for zoraida to repli made answer do not troubl thyself by
ask thy daughter zoraida so mani question seor for the on
answer i will give thee will serv for all i would have thee know that
she is a christian and that it is she who ha been the file for our
chain and our deliver from captiv she is here of her own free
will as glad i imagin to find herself in thi posit as he who
escap from dark into the light from death to life and from
suffer to glori
daughter is thi true what he sai cri the moor
it is repli zoraida
that thou art in truth a christian said the old man and that thou
hast given thy father into the power of hi enemi
to which zoraida made answer a christian i am but it is not i who
have place thee in thi posit for it never wa my wish to leav
thee or do thee harm but onli to do good to myself
and what good hast thou done thyself daughter said he
ask thou that said she of lela marien for she can tell thee
better than i
the moor had hardli heard these word when with marvel quick he
flung himself headforemost into the sea where no doubt he would have
been drown had not the long and full dress he wore held him up for a
littl on the surfac of the water zoraida cri aloud to us to save
him and we all hasten to help and seiz him by hi robe we drew
him in half drown and insens at which zoraida wa in such
distress that she wept over him as piteous and bitterli as though he
were alreadi dead we turn him upon hi face and he void a great
quantiti of water and at the end of two hour came to himself
meanwhil the wind have chang we were compel to head for the
land and ply our oar to avoid be driven on shore but it wa our
good fortun to reach a creek that li on on side of a small
promontori or cape call by the moor that of the cava rumia which
in our languag mean the wick christian woman for it is a
tradit among them that la cava through whom spain wa lost li
buri at that spot cava in their languag mean wick woman
and rumia christian moreov thei count it unlucki to anchor
there when necess compel them and thei never do so otherwis for
us howev it wa not the restingplac of the wick woman but a
haven of safeti for our relief so much had the sea now got up we
post a lookout on shore and never let the oar out of our hand
and at of the store the renegad had laid in implor god and our
ladi with all our heart to help and protect us that we might give a
happi end to a begin so prosper at the entreati of zoraida
order were given to set on shore her father and the other moor who
were still bound for she could not endur nor could her tender heart
bear to see her father in bond and her fellowcountrymen prison
befor her ey we promis her to do thi at the moment of departur
for as it wa uninhabit we ran no risk in releas them at that
place
our prayer were not so far in vain as to be unheard by heaven for
after a while the wind chang in our favour and made the sea calm
invit us onc more to resum our voyag with a good heart see
thi we unbound the moor and on by on put them on shore at which
thei were fill with amaz but when we came to land zoraida
father who had now complet recov hi sens he said
why is it think ye christian that thi wick woman is rejoic at
your give me my liberti think ye it is becaus of the affect she
bear me nai verili it is onli becaus of the hindranc my presenc
offer to the execut of her base design and think not that it is
her belief that your is better than our that ha led her to chang
her religion it is onli becaus she know that immodesti is more
freeli practis in your countri than in our then turn to
zoraida while i and anoth of the christian held him fast by both
arm lest he should do some mad act he said to her infam girl
misguid maiden whither in thy blind and mad art thou go
in the hand of these dog our natur enemi curs be the hour
when i begot thee curs the luxuri and indulg in which i rear
thee
but see that he wa not like soon to ceas i made hast to put him
on shore and thenc he continu hi maledict and lament
aloud call on moham to prai to allah to destroi us to confound
us to make an end of us and when in consequ of have made sail
we could no longer hear what he said we could see what he did how he
pluck out hi beard and tore hi hair and lai writh on the ground
but onc he rais hi voic to such a pitch that we were abl to hear
what he said come back dear daughter come back to shore i forgiv
thee all let those men have the monei for it is their now and come
back to comfort thy sorrow father who will yield up hi life on

all thi zoraida heard and heard with sorrow and tear and all she
could sai in answer wa allah grant that lela marien who ha made me
becom a christian give thee comfort in thy sorrow my father allah
know that i could not do otherwis than i have done and that these
christian ow noth to my will for even had i wish not to
accompani them but remain at home it would have been imposs for
me so eagerli did my soul urg me on to the accomplish of thi
purpos which i feel to be as righteou as to thee dear father it
seem wick
but neither could her father hear her nor we see him when she said
thi and so while i consol zoraida we turn our attent to our
voyag in which a breez from the right point so favour us that we
made sure of find ourselv off the coast of spain on the morrow by
daybreak but as good seldom or never come pure and unmix without
be attend or follow by some disturb evil that give a shock
to it our fortun or perhap the curs which the moor had hurl at
hi daughter for whatev kind of father thei mai come from these ar
alwai to be dread brought it about that when we were now in
midsea and the night about three hour spent as we were run with
all sail set and oar lash for the favour breez save us the
troubl of us them we saw by the light of the moon which shone
brilliantli a squarerig vessel in full sail close to us luf
up and stand across our cours and so close that we had to strike
sail to avoid run foul of her while thei too put the helm hard up
to let us pass thei came to the side of the ship to ask who we were
whither we were bound and whenc we came but as thei ask thi in
french our renegad said let no on answer for no doubt these ar
french corsair who plunder all comer

act on thi warn no on answer a word but after we had gone a
littl ahead and the vessel wa now ly to leeward suddenli thei
fire two gun and appar both load with chainshot for with
on thei cut our mast in half and brought down both it and the sail
into the sea and the other discharg at the same moment sent a ball
into our vessel amidship stave her in complet but without do
ani further damag we howev find ourselv sink began to
shout for help and call upon those in the ship to pick us up as we were
begin to fill thei then lai to and lower a skiff or boat as
mani as a dozen frenchmen well arm with matchlock and their
match burn got into it and came alongsid and see how few we
were and that our vessel wa go down thei took us in tell us
that thi had come to us through our incivil in not give them an
answer our renegad took the trunk contain zoraida wealth and
drop it into the sea without anyon perceiv what he did in short
we went on board with the frenchmen who after have ascertain all
thei want to know about us rifl us of everyth we had as if
thei had been our bitterest enemi and from zoraida thei took even
the anklet she wore on her feet but the distress thei caus her did
not distress me so much as the fear i wa in that from rob her of
her rich and preciou jewel thei would proce to rob her of the most
preciou jewel that she valu more than all the desir howev of
those peopl do not go beyond monei but of that their covet is
insati and on thi occas it wa carri to such a pitch that
thei would have taken even the cloth we wore as captiv if thei had
been worth anyth to them it wa the advic of some of them to throw
us all into the sea wrap up in a sail for their purpos wa to
trade at some of the port of spain give themselv out as breton
and if thei brought us aliv thei would be punish as soon as the
robberi wa discov but the captain who wa the on who had
plunder my belov zoraida said he wa satisfi with the prize he
had got and that he would not touch at ani spanish port but pass the
strait of gibraltar by night or as best he could and make for la
rochel from which he had sail so thei agre by common consent to
give us the skiff belong to their ship and all we requir for the
short voyag that remain to us and thi thei did the next dai on
come in sight of the spanish coast with which and the joi we felt
all our suffer and miseri were as complet forgotten as if thei
had never been endur by us such is the delight of recov lost
liberti
it mai have been about middai when thei place us in the boat give
us two keg of water and some biscuit and the captain move by i know
not what compass as the love zoraida wa about to embark gave
her some forti gold crown and would not permit hi men to take from
her those same garment which she ha on now we got into the boat
return them thank for their kind to us and show ourselv
grate rather than indign thei stood out to sea steer for the
strait we without look to ani compass save the land we had befor
us set ourselv to row with such energi that by sunset we were so
near that we might easili we thought land befor the night wa far
advanc but as the moon did not show that night and the sky wa
cloud and as we knew not whereabout we were it did not seem to us
a prudent thing to make for the shore as sever of us advis sai
we ought to run ourselv ashor even if it were on rock and far from
ani habit for in thi wai we should be reliev from the
apprehens we natur felt of the prowl vessel of the tetuan
corsair who leav barbari at nightfal and ar on the spanish coast
by daybreak where thei commonli take some prize and then go home to
sleep in their own hous but of the conflict counsel the on
which wa adopt wa that we should approach gradual and land where
we could if the sea were calm enough to permit us thi wa done and a
littl befor midnight we drew near to the foot of a huge and lofti
mountain not so close to the sea but that it left a narrow space on
which to land conveni we ran our boat up on the sand and all
sprang out and kiss the ground and with tear of joy satisfact
return thank to god our lord for all hi incompar good to us
on our voyag we took out of the boat the provis it contain and
drew it up on the shore and then climb a long wai up the mountain
for even there we could not feel easi in our heart or persuad
ourselv that it wa christian soil that wa now under our feet
the dawn came more slowli i think than we could have wish we
complet the ascent in order to see if from the summit ani habit
or ani shepherd hut could be discov but strain our ey as we
might neither dwell nor human be nor path nor road could we
perceiv howev we determin to push on farther as it could not
but be that er long we must see someon who could tell us where we
were but what distress me most wa to see zoraida go on foot over
that rough ground for though i onc carri her on my shoulder she
wa more weari by my weari than rest by the rest and so she
would never again allow me to undergo the exert and went on veri
patient and cheerfulli while i led her by the hand we had gone
rather less than a quarter of a leagu when the sound of a littl bell
fell on our ear a clear proof that there were flock hard by and
look about carefulli to see if ani were within view we observ a
young shepherd tranquilli and unsuspici trim a stick with hi
knife at the foot of a cork tree we call to him and he rais hi
head sprang nimbl to hi feet for as we afterward learn the
first who present themselv to hi sight were the renegad and
zoraida and see them in moorish dress he imagin that all the
moor of barbari were upon him and plung with marvel swift
into the thicket in front of him he began to rais a prodigi
outcri exclaim the moorsth moor have land to arm to
arm we were all thrown into perplex by these cri not know
what to do but reflect that the shout of the shepherd would rais
the countri and that the mount coastguard would come at onc to see
what wa the matter we agre that the renegad must strip off hi
turkish garment and put on a captiv jacket or coat which on of our
parti gave him at onc though he himself wa reduc to hi shirt and
so commend ourselv to god we follow the same road which we saw
the shepherd take expect everi moment that the coastguard would be
down upon us nor did our expect deceiv us for two hour had not
pass when come out of the brushwood into the open ground we
perceiv some fifti mount men swiftli approach us at a
handgallop as soon as we saw them we stood still wait for them
but as thei came close and instead of the moor thei were in quest of
saw a set of poor christian thei were taken aback and on of them
ask if it could be we who were the caus of the shepherd have
rais the call to arm i said ye and as i wa about to explain to
him what had occur and whenc we came and who we were on of the
christian of our parti recognis the horseman who had put the
question to us and befor i could sai anyth more he exclaim
thank be to god sir for bring us to such good quarter for if
i do not deceiv myself the ground we stand on is that of velez malaga
unless inde all my year of captiv have made me unabl to
recollect that you seor who ask who we ar ar pedro de bustamant
my uncl
the christian captiv had hardli utter these word when the horseman
threw himself off hi hors and ran to embrac the young man cry
nephew of my soul and life i recognis thee now and long have i
mourn thee as dead i and my sister thy mother and all thy kin
that ar still aliv and whom god ha been pleas to preserv that

thou wert in algier and from the appear of thy garment and those
of all thi compani i conclud that ye have had a miracul
restor to liberti
it is true repli the young man and byandbi we will tell you
all
as soon as the horsemen understood that we were christian captiv
thei dismount from their hors and each offer hi to carri us to
the citi of velez malaga which wa a leagu and a half distant some
of them went to bring the boat to the citi we have told them where
we had left it other took us up behind them and zoraida wa place
on the hors of the young man uncl the whole town came out to meet
us for thei had by thi time heard of our arriv from on who had
gone on in advanc thei were not astonish to see liber captiv
or captiv moor for peopl on that coast ar well us to see both
on and the other but thei were astonish at the beauti of zoraida
which wa just then heighten as well by the exert of travel
as by joi at find herself on christian soil and reliev of all
fear of be lost for thi had brought such a glow upon her face
that unless my affect for her were deceiv me i would ventur to
sai that there wa not a more beauti creatur in the worldat least
that i had ever seen we went straight to the church to return thank
to god for the merci we had receiv and when zoraida enter it she
said there were face there like lela marien we told her thei were
her imag and as well as he could the renegad explain to her what
thei meant that she might ador them as if each of them were the veri
same lela marien that had spoken to her and she have great
intellig and a quick and clear instinct understood at onc all he
said to her about them thenc thei took us awai and distribut us all
in differ hous in the town but as for the renegad zoraida and
myself the christian who came with us brought us to the hous of hi
parent who had a fair share of the gift of fortun and treat us
with as much kind as thei did their own son
we remain six dai in velez at the end of which the renegad have
inform himself of all that wa requisit for him to do set out for
the citi of granada to restor himself to the sacr bosom of the
church through the medium of the holi inquisit the other releas
captiv took their departur each the wai that seem best to him
and zoraida and i were left alon with noth more than the crown
which the courtesi of the frenchman had bestow upon zoraida out of
which i bought the beast on which she ride and i for the present
attend her as her father and squir and not as her husband we ar
now go to ascertain if my father is live or if ani of my brother
ha had better fortun than mine ha been though as heaven ha made
me the companion of zoraida i think no other lot could be assign to
me howev happi that i would rather have the patienc with which
she endur the hardship that poverti bring with it and the
eager she show to becom a christian ar such that thei fill me
with admir and bind me to serv her all my life though the

kindli and sincer that the captain wa much gratifi by their
goodwil in particular don fernando offer if he would go back with
him to get hi brother the marqui to becom godfath at the baptism
of zoraida and on hi own part to provid him with the mean of make
hi appear in hi own countri with the credit and comfort he wa
entitl to for all thi the captiv return thank veri courteous
although he would not accept ani of their gener offer
by thi time night close in and as it did there came up to the inn a
coach attend by some men on horseback who demand accommod to
which the landladi repli that there wa not a hand breadth of the
whole inn unoccupi
still for all that said on of those who had enter on horseback

at thi name the landladi wa taken aback and said seor the fact
is i have no bed but if hi lordship the judg carri on with him
as no doubt he doe let him come in and welcom for my husband and i

got out of the coach whose dress indic at a glanc the offic and
post he held for the long robe with ruffl sleev that he wore
show that he wa as hi servant said a judg of appeal he led by
the hand a young girl in a travel dress appar about sixteen
year of ag and of such a highbr air so beauti and so
grace that all were fill with admir when she made her
appear and but for have seen dorothea luscinda and zoraida
who were there in the inn thei would have fanci that a beauti like
that of thi maiden would have been hard to find don quixot wa
present at the entranc of the judg with the young ladi and as soon
as he saw him he said your worship mai with confid enter and take
your eas in thi castl for though the accommod be scanti and
poor there ar no quarter so cramp or inconveni that thei cannot
make room for arm and letter abov all if arm and letter have
beauti for a guid and leader as letter repres by your worship
have in thi fair maiden to whom not onli ought castl to throw
themselv open and yield themselv up but rock should rend
themselv asund and mountain divid and bow themselv down to give
her a recept enter your worship i sai into thi paradis for
here you will find star and sun to accompani the heaven your worship
bring with you here you will find arm in their suprem excel
and beauti in it highest perfect
the judg wa struck with amaz at the languag of don quixot
whom he scrutin veri carefulli no less astonish by hi figur
than by hi talk and befor he could find word to answer him he had a
fresh surpris when he saw opposit to him luscinda dorothea and
zoraida who have heard of the new guest and of the beauti of the
young ladi had come to see her and welcom her don fernando
cardenio and the curat howev greet him in a more intellig
and polish style in short the judg made hi entranc in a state of
bewilder as well with what he saw as what he heard and the fair
ladi of the inn gave the fair damsel a cordial welcom on the whole
he could perceiv that all who were there were peopl of qualiti but
with the figur counten and bear of don quixot he wa at hi
wit end and all civil have been exchang and the
accommod of the inn inquir into it wa settl as it had been
befor settl that all the women should retir to the garret that ha
been alreadi mention and that the men should remain outsid as if to
guard them the judg therefor wa veri well pleas to allow hi
daughter for such the damsel wa to go with the ladi which she did
veri willingli and with part of the host narrow bed and half of what
the judg had brought with him thei made a more comfort
arrang for the night than thei had expect
the captiv whose heart had leap within him the instant he saw the
judg tell him somehow that thi wa hi brother ask on of the
servant who accompani him what hi name wa and whether he knew
from what part of the countri he came the servant repli that he wa
call the licenti juan perez de viedma and that he had heard it
said he came from a villag in the mountain of leon from thi
statement and what he himself had seen he felt convinc that thi
wa hi brother who had adopt letter by hi father advic and
excit and rejoic he call don fernando and cardenio and the
curat asid and told them how the matter stood assur them that
the judg wa hi brother the servant had further inform him that he
wa now go to the indi with the appoint of judg of the
suprem court of mexico and he had learn likewis that the young
ladi wa hi daughter whose mother had di in give birth to her
and that he wa veri rich in consequ of the dowri left to him with
the daughter he ask their advic as to what mean he should adopt to
make himself known or to ascertain beforehand whether when he had
made himself known hi brother see him so poor would be asham
of him or would receiv him with a warm heart
leav it to me to find out that said the curat though there is no
reason for suppos seor captain that you will not be kindli
receiv becaus the worth and wisdom that your brother bear
show him to possess do not make it like that he will prove haughti
or insens or that he will not know how to estim the accid
of fortun at their proper valu
still said the captain i would not make myself known abruptli but
in some indirect wai
i have told you alreadi said the curat that i will manag it in a
wai to satisfi us all
by thi time supper wa readi and thei all took their seat at the
tabl except the captiv and the ladi who sup by themselv in
their own room in the middl of supper the curat said
i had a comrad of your worship name seor judg in
constantinopl where i wa a captiv for sever year and that same
comrad wa on of the stoutest soldier and captain in the whole
spanish infantri but he had as larg a share of misfortun as he had
of gallantri and courag
and how wa the captain call seor ask the judg
he wa call rui perez de viedma repli the curat and he wa
born in a villag in the mountain of leon and he mention a
circumst connect with hi father and hi brother which had it
not been told me by so truth a man as he wa i should have set down
as on of those fabl the old women tell over the fire in winter for
he said hi father had divid hi properti among hi three son and
had address word of advic to them sounder than ani of cato but i
can sai thi much that the choic he made of go to the war wa
attend with such success that by hi gallant conduct and courag
and without ani help save hi own merit he rose in a few year to be
captain of infantri and to see himself on the highroad and in
posit to be given the command of a corp befor long but fortun
wa against him for where he might have expect her favour he lost
it and with it hi liberti on that gloriou dai when so mani
recov their at the battl of lepanto i lost mine at the goletta
and after a varieti of adventur we found ourselv comrad at
constantinopl thenc he went to algier where he met with on of the
most extraordinari adventur that ever befel anyon in the world
here the curat went on to relat briefli hi brother adventur with
zoraida to all which the judg gave such an attent hear that he
never befor had been so much of a hearer the curat howev onli
went so far as to describ how the frenchmen plunder those who were
in the boat and the poverti and distress in which hi comrad and the
fair moor were left of whom he said he had not been abl to learn what
becam of them or whether thei had reach spain or been carri to
franc by the frenchmen
the captain stand a littl to on side wa listen to all the
curat said and watch everi movement of hi brother who as soon
as he perceiv the curat had made an end of hi stori gave a deep
sigh and said with hi ey full of tear oh seor if you onli knew
what new you have given me and how it come home to me make me show
how i feel it with these tear that spring from my ey in spite of all
my worldli wisdom and selfrestraint that brave captain that you speak
of is my eldest brother who be of a bolder and loftier mind than
my other brother or myself chose the honour and worthi call of
arm which wa on of the three career our father propos to us as
your comrad mention in that fabl you thought he wa tell you i
follow that of letter in which god and my own exert have rais
me to the posit in which you see me my second brother is in peru
so wealthi that with what he ha sent to my father and to me he ha
fulli repaid the portion he took with him and ha even furnish my
father hand with the mean of gratifi hi natur generos
while i too have been enabl to pursu my studi in a more becom
and credit fashion and so to attain my present stand my father
is still aliv though dy with anxieti to hear of hi eldest son
and he prai god unceasingli that death mai not close hi ey until he
ha look upon those of hi son but with regard to him what surpris
me is that have so much common sens as he had he should have
neglect to give ani intellig about himself either in hi
troubl and suffer or in hi prosper for if hi father or ani
of us had known of hi condit he need not have wait for that
miracl of the reed to obtain hi ransom but what now disquiet me is
the uncertainti whether those frenchmen mai have restor him to
liberti or murder him to hide the robberi all thi will make me
continu my journei not with the satisfact in which i began it but
in the deepest melancholi and sad oh dear brother that i onli
knew where thou art now and i would hasten to seek thee out and
deliv thee from thy suffer though it were to cost me suffer
myself oh that i could bring new to our old father that thou art
aliv even wert thou in the deepest dungeon of barbari for hi wealth
and my brother and mine would rescu thee thenc oh beauti and
gener zoraida that i could repai thy good to a brother that i
could be present at the new birth of thy soul and at thy bridal that
would give us all such happi
all thi and more the judg utter with such deep emot at the new
he had receiv of hi brother that all who heard him share in it
show their sympathi with hi sorrow the curat see then how
well he had succeed in carri out hi purpos and the captain
wish had no desir to keep them unhappi ani longer so he rose from
the tabl and go into the room where zoraida wa he took her by the
hand luscinda dorothea and the judg daughter follow her the
captain wa wait to see what the curat would do when the latter
take him with the other hand advanc with both of them to where the
judg and the other gentlemen were and said let your tear ceas to
flow seor judg and the wish of your heart be gratifi as fulli as
you could desir for you have befor you your worthi brother and your
good sisterinlaw he whom you see here is the captain viedma and
thi is the fair moor who ha been so good to him the frenchmen i told
you of have reduc them to the state of poverti you see that you mai
show the generos of your kind heart
the captain ran to embrac hi brother who place both hand on hi
breast so as to have a good look at him hold him a littl wai off
but as soon as he had fulli recognis him he clasp him in hi arm
so close shed such tear of heartfelt joi that most of those
present could not but join in them the word the brother exchang
the emot thei show can scarc be imagin i fanci much less
put down in write thei told each other in a few word the event of
their live thei show the true affect of brother in all it
strength then the judg embrac zoraida put all he possess at
her dispos then he made hi daughter embrac her and the fair
christian and the love moor drew fresh tear from everi ey and
there wa don quixot observ all these strang proceed
attent without utter a word and attribut the whole to
chimera of knighterrantri then thei agre that the captain and
zoraida should return with hi brother to sevil and send new to hi
father of hi have been deliv and found so as to enabl him to
come and be present at the marriag and baptism of zoraida for it wa
imposs for the judg to put off hi journei as he wa inform
that in a month from that time the fleet wa to sail from sevil for
new spain and to miss the passag would have been a great
inconveni to him in short everybodi wa well pleas and glad at
the captiv good fortun and as now almost twothird of the night
were past thei resolv to retir to rest for the remaind of it don
quixot offer to mount guard over the castl lest thei should be
attack by some giant or other malevol scoundrel covet of the
great treasur of beauti the castl contain those who understood him
return him thank for thi servic and thei gave the judg an
account of hi extraordinari humour with which he wa not a littl
amus sancho panza alon wa fume at the late of the hour for
retir to rest and he of all wa the on that made himself most
comfort as he stretch himself on the trap of hi ass
which as will be told farther on cost him so dear
the ladi then have retir to their chamber and the other
have dispos themselv with as littl discomfort as thei could don
quixot salli out of the inn to act as sentinel of the castl as he

the singer had got so far when it struck dorothea that it wa not fair
to let clara miss hear such a sweet voic so shake her from side
to side she woke her sai
forgiv me child for wake thee but i do so that thou mayest have
the pleasur of hear the best voic thou hast ever heard perhap
in all thy life
clara awok quit drowsi and not understand at the moment what
dorothea said ask her what it wa she repeat what she had said
and clara becam attent at onc but she had hardli heard two line

let him in heaven name return clara and not to hear him she
stop both ear with her hand at which dorothea wa again
surpris but turn her attent to the song she found that it ran
in thi fashion
sweet hope my stai

here the voic ceas and clara sob began afresh all which excit
dorothea curios to know what could be the caus of sing so
sweet and weep so bitter so she again ask her what it wa she wa
go to sai befor on thi clara afraid that luscinda might overhear
her wind her arm tightli round dorothea put her mouth so close to
her ear that she could speak without fear of be heard by anyon
els and said
thi singer dear seora is the son of a gentleman of aragon lord of
two villag who live opposit my father hous at madrid and
though my father had curtain to the window of hi hous in winter
and latticework in summer in some wayi know not howthi gentleman
who wa pursu hi studi saw me whether in church or elsewher i

on hand in the other to show me he wish to marri me and though i
should have been glad if that could be be alon and motherless i
knew not whom to open my mind to and so i left it as it wa show
him no favour except when my father and hi too were from home to

at which he would show such delight that he seem as if he were go
mad meanwhil the time for my father departur arriv which he

return can be made to you as is due to your great merit and gentl
birth for which you must not blame thi unhappi knighterr whom
love render incap of submiss to ani other than her whom the
first moment hi ey beheld her he made absolut mistress of hi
soul forgiv me nobl ladi and retir to your apart and do not
by ani further declar of your passion compel me to show myself
more ungrat and if of the love you bear me you should find that
there is anyth els in my power wherein i can gratifi you provid
it be not love itself demand it of me for i swear to you by that
sweet absent enemi of mine to grant it thi instant though it be that
you requir of me a lock of medusa hair which wa all snake or
even the veri beam of the sun shut up in a vial
my mistress want noth of that sort sir knight said maritorn
at thi
what then discreet dame is it that your mistress want repli don
quixot
onli on of your fair hand said maritorn to enabl her to vent
over it the great passion passion which ha brought her to thi
loophol so much to the risk of her honour for if the lord her father
had heard her the least slice he would cut off her would be her ear
i should like to see that tri said don quixot but he had better
bewar of that if he doe not want to meet the most disastr end
that ever father in the world met for have laid hand on the tender
limb of a lovestricken daughter
maritorn felt sure that don quixot would present the hand she had
ask and make up her mind what to do she got down from the hole
and went into the stabl where she took the halter of sancho panza
ass and in all hast return to the hole just as don quixot had
plant himself stand on rocinant saddl in order to reach the
grate window where he suppos the lovelorn damsel to be and give
her hi hand he said ladi take thi hand or rather thi scourg of
the evildo of the earth take i sai thi hand which no other hand
of woman ha ever touch not even her who ha complet possess of
my entir bodi i present it to you not that you mai kiss it but that
you mai observ the contextur of the sinew the close network of the
muscl the breadth and capac of the vein whenc you mai infer
what must be the strength of the arm that ha such a hand
that we shall see present said maritorn and make a run
knot on the halter she pass it over hi wrist and come down from
the hole ti the other end veri firmli to the bolt of the door of the
strawloft
don quixot feel the rough of the rope on hi wrist exclaim
your grace seem to be grate rather than caress my hand treat it
not so harshli for it is not to blame for the offenc my resolut
ha given you nor is it just to wreak all your vengeanc on so small a
part rememb that on who love so well should not reveng herself so
cruelli
but there wa nobodi now to listen to these word of don quixot for
as soon as maritorn had ti him she and the other made off readi to
die with laugh leav him fasten in such a wai that it wa
imposs for him to releas himself
he wa as ha been said stand on rocinant with hi arm pass
through the hole and hi wrist ti to the bolt of the door and in
mighti fear and dread of be left hang by the arm if rocinant
were to stir on side or the other so he did not dare to make the
least movement although from the patienc and imperturb
disposit of rocinant he had good reason to expect that he would
stand without budg for a whole centuri find himself fast then
and that the ladi had retir he began to fanci that all thi wa
done by enchant as on the former occas when in that same castl
that enchant moor of a carrier had belabour him and he curs in
hi heart hi own want of sens and judgment in ventur to enter the
castl again after have come off so badli the first time it be a
settl point with knightserr that when thei have tri an
adventur and have not succeed in it it is a sign that it is not
reserv for them but for other and that therefor thei need not try
it again nevertheless he pull hi arm to see if he could releas
himself but it had been made so fast that all hi effort were in
vain it is true he pull it gentli lest rocinant should move but
try as he might to seat himself in the saddl he had noth for it
but to stand upright or pull hi hand off then it wa he wish for
the sword of amadi against which no enchant whatev had ani
power then he curs hi ill fortun then he magnifi the loss the
world would sustain by hi absenc while he remain there enchant
for that he believ he wa beyond all doubt then he onc more took to
think of hi belov dulcinea del toboso then he call to hi
worthi squir sancho panza who buri in sleep and stretch upon the
packsaddl of hi ass wa oblivi at that moment of the mother
that bore him then he call upon the sage lirgandeo and alquif to
come to hi aid then he invok hi good friend urganda to succour
him and then at last morn found him in such a state of
desper and perplex that he wa bellow like a bull for he
had no hope that dai would bring ani relief to hi suffer which he
believ would last for ever inasmuch as he wa enchant and of thi
he wa convinc by see that rocinant never stir much or
littl and he felt persuad that he and hi hors were to remain in
thi state without eat or drink or sleep until the malign
influenc of the star wa overpast or until some other more sage
enchant should disench him
but he wa veri much deceiv in thi conclus for daylight had
hardli begun to appear when there came up to the inn four men on
horseback well equip and accoutr with firelock across their
saddlebow thei call out and knock loudli at the gate of the inn
which wa still shut on see which don quixot even there where he
wa did not forget to act as sentinel and said in a loud and
imperi tone knight or squir or whatev ye be ye have no
right to knock at the gate of thi castl for it is plain enough that
thei who ar within ar either asleep or els ar not in the habit of
throw open the fortress until the sun rai ar spread over the
whole surfac of the earth withdraw to a distanc and wait till it is
broad daylight and then we shall see whether it will be proper or not
to open to you
what the devil fortress or castl is thi said on to make us
stand on such ceremoni if you ar the innkeep bid them open to us
we ar travel who onli want to feed our hors and go on for we
ar in hast
do you think gentlemen that i look like an innkeep said don
quixot
i dont know what you look like repli the other but i know that
you ar talk nonsens when you call thi inn a castl
a castl it is return don quixot nai more on of the best in
thi whole provinc and it ha within it peopl who have had the
sceptr in the hand and the crown on the head
it would be better if it were the other wai said the travel the
sceptr on the head and the crown in the hand but if so mayb there
is within some compani of player with whom it is a common thing to
have those crown and sceptr you speak of for in such a small inn as
thi and where such silenc is kept i do not believ ani peopl
entitl to crown and sceptr can have taken up their quarter
you know but littl of the world return don quixot sinc you
ar ignor of what commonli occur in knighterrantri
but the comrad of the spokesman grow weari of the dialogu with
don quixot renew their knock with great vehem so much so that
the host and not onli he but everybodi in the inn awok and he got
up to ask who knock it happen at thi moment that on of the
hors of the four who were seek admitt went to smell rocinant
who melancholi deject and with droop ear stood motionless
support hi sore stretch master and as he wa after all
flesh though he look as if he were made of wood he could not help
give wai and in return smell the on who had come to offer him
attent but he had hardli move at all when don quixot lost hi
foot and slip off the saddl he would have come to the ground
but for be suspend by the arm which caus him such agoni that he
believ either hi wrist would be cut through or hi arm torn off and
he hung so near the ground that he could just touch it with hi feet
which wa all the wors for him for find how littl wa want to
enabl him to plant hi feet firmli he struggl and stretch himself
as much as he could to gain a foot just like those undergo the
tortur of the strappado when thei ar fix at touch and no touch
who aggrav their own suffer by their violent effort to stretch
themselv deceiv by the hope which make them fanci that with a
veri littl more thei will reach the ground

outcri suspect what it wa ran to the loft and without anyon
see her unti the halter by which don quixot wa suspend and
down he came to the ground in the sight of the landlord and the
travel who approach ask him what wa the matter with him that

him the lie challeng him and defi him to singl combat
the newli arriv travel were amaz at the word of don quixot
but the landlord remov their surpris by tell them who he wa and
not to mind him as he wa out of hi sens thei then ask the
landlord if by ani chanc a youth of about fifteen year of ag had
come to that inn on dress like a mulet and of such and such an
appear describ that of doa clara lover the landlord repli
that there were so mani peopl in the inn he had not notic the person
thei were inquir for but on of them observ the coach in which
the judg had come said he is here no doubt for thi is the coach
he is follow let on of us stai at the gate and the rest go in to
look for him or inde it would be as well if on of us went round the
inn lest he should escap over the wall of the yard so be it said
anoth and while two of them went in on remain at the gate and
the other made the circuit of the inn observ all which the
landlord wa unabl to conjectur for what reason thei were take all
these precaut though he understood thei were look for the youth
whose descript thei had given him

so near her the other from curios to see him don quixot when he
saw that not on of the four travel took ani notic of him or
repli to hi challeng wa furiou and readi to die with indign

that it wa law for a knighterr to undertak or engag in
anoth enterpris when he had plight hi word and faith not to
involv himself in ani until he had made an end of the on to which he
wa pledg he would have attack the whole of them and would have
made them return an answer in spite of themselv but consid that
it would not becom him nor be right to begin ani new empris until
he had establish micomicona in her kingdom he wa constrain to
hold hi peac and wait quietli to see what would be the upshot of the
proceed of those same travel on of whom found the youth thei
were seek ly asleep by the side of a mulet without a thought
of anyon come in search of him much less find him
the man laid hold of him by the arm sai it becom you well
inde seor don lui to be in the dress you wear and well the bed
in which i find you agre with the luxuri in which your mother rear

the youth rub hi sleepi ey and stare for a while at him who held
him but present recognis him as on of hi father servant at
which he wa so taken aback that for some time he could not find or
utter a word while the servant went on to sai there is noth for
it now seor don lui but to submit quietli and return home unless
it is your wish that my lord your father should take hi departur
for the other world for noth els can be the consequ of the
grief he is in at your absenc
but how did my father know that i had gone thi road and in thi
dress said don lui

to restor you to those ey that so yearn for you
that shall be as i pleas or as heaven order return don lui
what can you pleas or heaven order said the other except to agre
to go back anyth els is imposs
all thi convers between the two wa overheard by the mulet at
whose side don lui lai and rise he went to report what had taken
place to don fernando cardenio and the other who had by thi time
dress themselv and told them how the man had address the youth
as don and what word had pass and how he want him to return to
hi father which the youth wa unwil to do with thi and what
thei alreadi knew of the rare voic that heaven had bestow upon him
thei all felt veri anxiou to know more particularli who he wa and
even to help him if it wa attempt to emploi forc against him so
thei hasten to where he wa still talk and argu with hi
servant dorothea at thi instant came out of her room follow by
doa clara all in a tremor and call cardenio asid she told him in
a few word the stori of the musician and doa clara and he at the
same time told her what had happen how hi father servant had
come in search of him but in tell her so he did not speak low
enough but that doa clara heard what he said at which she wa so much
agit that had not dorothea hasten to support her she would have
fallen to the ground cardenio then bade dorothea return to her room
as he would endeavour to make the whole matter right and thei did as
he desir all the four who had come in quest of don lui had now come
into the inn and surround him urg him to return and consol hi
father at onc and without a moment delai he repli that he could
not do so on ani account until he had conclud some busi in which
hi life honour and heart were at stake the servant press him
sai that most certainli thei would not return without him and that
thei would take him awai whether he like it or not
you shall not do that repli don lui unless you take me dead
though howev you take me it will be without life
by thi time most of those in the inn had been attract by the
disput but particularli cardenio don fernando hi companion the
judg the curat the barber and don quixot for he now consid
there wa no necess for mount guard over the castl ani longer
cardenio be alreadi acquaint with the young man stori ask the
men who want to take him awai what object thei had in seek to
carri off thi youth against hi will
our object said on of the four is to save the life of hi father
who is in danger of lose it through thi gentleman disappear
upon thi don lui exclaim there is no need to make my affair
public here i am free and i will return if i pleas and if not none
of you shall compel me
reason will compel your worship said the man and if it ha no
power over you it ha power over us to make us do what we came for
and what it is our duti to do
let us hear what the whole affair is about said the judg at thi
but the man who knew him as a neighbour of their repli do you
not know thi gentleman seor judg he is the son of your neighbour
who ha run awai from hi father hous in a dress so unbecom hi
rank as your worship mai perceiv
the judg on thi look at him more carefulli and recognis him and
embrac him said what folli is thi seor don lui or what can
have been the caus that could have induc you to come here in thi
wai and in thi dress which so ill becom your condit
tear came into the ey of the young man and he wa unabl to utter a
word in repli to the judg who told the four servant not to be
uneasi for all would be satisfactorili settl and then take don
lui by the hand he drew him asid and ask the reason of hi have
come there
but while he wa question him thei heard a loud outcri at the gate
of the inn the caus of which wa that two of the guest who had
pass the night there see everybodi busi about find out what it
wa the four men want had conceiv the idea of go off without
pai what thei ow but the landlord who mind hi own affair
more than other peopl caught them go out of the gate and
demand hi reckon abus them for their dishonesti with such
languag that he drove them to repli with their fist and so thei
began to lai on him in such a style that the poor man wa forc to cry
out and call for help the landladi and her daughter could see no on
more free to give aid than don quixot and to him the daughter said
sir knight by the virtu god ha given you help my poor father for
two wick men ar beat him to a mummi
to which don quixot veri deliber and phlegmat repli
fair damsel at the present moment your request is inopportun for i
am debar from involv myself in ani adventur until i have brought
to a happi conclus on to which my word ha pledg me but that
which i can do for you is what i will now mention run and tell your
father to stand hi ground as well as he can in thi battl and on no
account to allow himself to be vanquish while i go and request
permiss of the princess micomicona to enabl me to succour him in
hi distress and if she grant it rest assur i will reliev him
from it
sinner that i am exclaim maritorn who stood by befor you

the other world for i will rescu him thenc in spite of all the same
world can do or at ani rate i will give you such a reveng over those
who shall have sent him there that you will be more than moder
satisfi and without sai anyth more he went and knelt befor
dorothea request her high in knightli and errant phrase to be
pleas to grant him permiss to aid and succour the castellan of
that castl who now stood in grievou jeopardi the princess grant
it gracious and he at onc brace hi buckler on hi arm and
draw hi sword hasten to the inngat where the two guest were
still handl the landlord roughli but as soon as he reach the spot
he stop short and stood still though maritorn and the landladi
ask him why he hesit to help their master and husband
i hesit said don quixot becaus it is not law for me to
draw sword against person of squir condit but call my squir
sancho to me for thi defenc and vengeanc ar hi affair and
busi
thu matter stood at the inngat where there wa a veri live
exchang of fisticuff and punch to the sore damag of the landlord
and to the wrath of maritorn the landladi and her daughter who
were furiou when thei saw the pusillanim of don quixot and the
hard treatment their master husband and father wa undergo but let
us leav him there for he will sure find someon to help him and if
not let him suffer and hold hi tongu who attempt more than hi
strength allow him to do and let us go back fifti pace to see what
don lui said in repli to the judg whom we left question him
privat as to hi reason for come on foot and so meanli dress
to which the youth press hi hand in a wai that show hi heart
wa troubl by some great sorrow and shed a flood of tear made
answer
seor i have no more to tell you than that from the moment when
through heaven will and our be near neighbour i first saw doa
clara your daughter and my ladi from that instant i made her the
mistress of my will and if your my true lord and father offer no
impedi thi veri dai she shall becom my wife for her i left my
father hous and for her i assum thi disguis to follow her
whithersoev she mai go as the arrow seek it mark or the sailor the
polestar she know noth more of my passion than what she mai have
learn from have sometim seen from a distanc that my ey were
fill with tear you know alreadi seor the wealth and nobl birth
of my parent and that i am their sole heir if thi be a suffici
induc for you to ventur to make me complet happi accept me at
onc as your son for if my father influenc by other object of hi
own should disapprov of thi happi i have sought for myself time
ha more power to alter and chang thing than human will
with thi the lovesmitten youth wa silent while the judg after
hear him wa astonish perplex and surpris as well at the
manner and intellig with which don lui had confess the secret of
hi heart as at the posit in which he found himself not know
what cours to take in a matter so sudden and unexpect all the
answer therefor he gave him wa to bid him to make hi mind easi for
the present and arrang with hi servant not to take him back that
dai so that there might be time to consid what wa best for all
parti don lui kiss hi hand by forc nai bath them with hi
tear in a wai that would have touch a heart of marbl not to sai
that of the judg who as a shrewd man had alreadi perceiv how
advantag the marriag would be to hi daughter though were it
possibl he would have prefer that it should be brought about with
the consent of the father of don lui who he knew look for a titl
for hi son
the guest had by thi time made peac with the landlord for by
persuas and don quixot fair word more than by threat thei had
paid him what he demand and the servant of don lui were wait
for the end of the convers with the judg and their master
decis when the devil who never sleep contriv that the barber
from whom don quixot had taken mambrino helmet and sancho panza the
trap of hi ass in exchang for those of hi own should at thi
instant enter the inn which said barber as he led hi ass to the
stabl observ sancho panza engag in repair someth or other
belong to the packsaddl and the moment he saw it he knew it and
made bold to attack sancho exclaim ho sir thief i have caught
you hand over my basin and my packsaddl and all my trap that
you rob me of
sancho find himself so unexpectedli assail and hear the abus
pour upon him seiz the packsaddl with on hand and with the
other gave the barber a cuff that bath hi teeth in blood the
barber howev wa not so readi to relinquish the prize he had made
in the packsaddl on the contrari he rais such an outcri that
everyon in the inn came run to know what the nois and quarrel
meant here in the name of the king and justic he cri thi
thief and highwayman want to kill me for try to recov my
properti
you lie said sancho i am no highwayman it wa in fair war my
master don quixot won these spoil
don quixot wa stand by at the time highli pleas to see hi
squir stout both offens and defens and from that time
forth he reckon him a man of mettl and in hi heart resolv to dub
him a knight on the first opportun that present itself feel
sure that the order of chivalri would be fittingli bestow upon him
in the cours of the alterc among other thing the barber said
gentlemen thi packsaddl is mine as sure as i ow god a death
and i know it as well as if i had given birth to it and here is my ass
in the stabl who will not let me lie onli try it and if it doe not
fit him like a glove call me a rascal and what is more the same dai
i wa rob of thi thei rob me likewis of a new brass basin
never yet handsel that would fetch a crown ani dai
at thi don quixot could not keep himself from answer and
interpos between the two and separ them he place the
packsaddl on the ground to lie there in sight until the truth wa
establish and said your worship mai perceiv clearli and plainli
the error under which thi worthi squir li when he call a basin
which wa is and shall be the helmet of mambrino which i won from him
in fair war and made myself master of by legitim and law
possess with the packsaddl i do not concern myself but i mai
tell you on that head that my squir sancho ask my permiss to
strip off the caparison of thi vanquish poltroon steed and with
it adorn hi own i allow him and he took it and as to it have
been chang from a caparison into a packsaddl i can give no
explan except the usual on that such transform will take
place in adventur of chivalri to confirm all which run sancho my
son and fetch hither the helmet which thi good fellow call a basin
egad master said sancho if we have no other proof of our case
than what your worship put forward mambrino helmet is just as much
a basin as thi good fellow caparison is a packsaddl
do as i bid thee said don quixot it cannot be that everyth in
thi castl goe by enchant
sancho hasten to where the basin wa and brought it back with him
and when don quixot saw it he took hold of it and said
your worship mai see with what a face thi squir can assert that
thi is a basin and not the helmet i told you of and i swear by the
order of chivalri i profess that thi helmet is the ident on i
took from him without anyth ad to or taken from it
there is no doubt of that said sancho for from the time my master
won it until now he ha onli fought on battl in it when he let loos
those unlucki men in chain and if it had not been for thi
basinhelmet he would not have come off over well that time for there
wa plenti of stonethrow in that affair

what do you think now gentlemen said the barber of what these
gentl sai when thei want to make out that thi is a helmet
and whoever sai the contrari said don quixot i will let him know
he li if he is a knight and if he is a squir that he li again a
thousand time
our own barber who wa present at all thi and understood don
quixot humour so thoroughli took it into hi head to back up hi
delus and carri on the joke for the gener amus so address
the other barber he said
seor barber or whatev you ar you must know that i belong to your
profess too and have had a licenc to practis for more than twenti
year and i know the implement of the barber craft everi on of
them perfectli well and i wa likewis a soldier for some time in the
dai of my youth and i know also what a helmet is and a morion and a
headpiec with a visor and other thing pertain to soldier i
meant to sai to soldier arm and i saysav better opinion and
alwai with submiss to sounder judgmentsthat thi piec we have now
befor us which thi worthi gentleman ha in hi hand not onli is no
barber basin but is as far from be on as white is from black
and truth from falsehood i sai moreov that thi although it is a
helmet is not a complet helmet
certainli not said don quixot for half of it is want that is
to sai the beaver
it is quit true said the curat who saw the object of hi friend
the barber and cardenio don fernando and hi companion agre with
him and even the judg if hi thought had not been so full of don
luiss affair would have help to carri on the joke but he wa so
taken up with the seriou matter he had on hi mind that he paid
littl or no attent to these faceti proceed
god bless me exclaim their butt the barber at thi is it
possibl that such an honour compani can sai that thi is not a
basin but a helmet why thi is a thing that would astonish a whole
univers howev wise it might be that will do if thi basin is a
helmet why then the packsaddl must be a hors caparison as thi
gentleman ha said
to me it look like a packsaddl said don quixot but i have
alreadi said that with that question i do not concern myself
as to whether it be packsaddl or caparison said the curat it is
onli for seor don quixot to sai for in these matter of chivalri all
these gentlemen and i bow to hi author
by god gentlemen said don quixot so mani strang thing have
happen to me in thi castl on the two occas on which i have
sojourn in it that i will not ventur to assert anyth posit
in repli to ani question touch anyth it contain for it is my
belief that everyth that goe on within it goe by enchant the
first time an enchant moor that there is in it gave me sore troubl
nor did sancho fare well among certain follow of hi and last night
i wa kept hang by thi arm for nearli two hour without know
how or why i came by such a mishap so that now for me to come forward
to give an opinion in such a puzzl matter would be to risk a rash
decis as regard the assert that thi is a basin and not a
helmet i have alreadi given an answer but as to the question whether
thi is a packsaddl or a caparison i will not ventur to give a
posit opinion but will leav it to your worship better judgment
perhap as you ar not dub knight like myself the enchant of
thi place have noth to do with you and your faculti ar
unfett and you can see thing in thi castl as thei realli and
truli ar and not as thei appear to me
there can be no question said don fernando on thi but that seor
don quixot ha spoken veri wise and that with us rest the decis
of thi matter and that we mai have surer ground to go on i will take
the vote of the gentlemen in secret and declar the result clearli
and fulli
to those who were in on the secret of don quixot humour all thi
afford great amus but to those who knew noth about it it
seem the greatest nonsens in the world in particular to the four
servant of don lui as well as to don lui himself and to three
other travel who had by chanc come to the inn and had the
appear of offic of the holi brotherhood as inde thei were
but the on who abov all wa at hi wit end wa the barber whose
basin there befor hi veri ey had been turn into mambrino
helmet and whose packsaddl he had no doubt whatev wa about to
becom a rich caparison for a hors all laugh to see don fernando
go from on to anoth collect the vote and whisper to them
to give him their privat opinion whether the treasur over which there
had been so much fight wa a packsaddl or a caparison but after
he had taken the vote of those who knew don quixot he said aloud
the fact is my good fellow that i am tire collect such a number
of opinion for i find that there is not on of whom i ask what i
desir to know who doe not tell me that it is absurd to sai that thi

good reason apprehend suspect how it wa then he wish to
satisfi himself as to whether don quixot featur correspond and
take a parchment out of hi bosom he lit upon what he wa in search

reader as he made out each word he fix hi ey on don quixot and
went on compar the descript in the warrant with hi face and
discov that beyond all doubt he wa the person describ in it as
soon as he had satisfi himself fold up the parchment he took the
warrant in hi left hand and with hi right seiz don quixot by the
collar so tightli that he did not allow him to breath and shout
aloud help for the holi brotherhood and that you mai see i demand it
in earnest read thi warrant which sai thi highwayman is to be

the curat took the warrant and saw that what the offic said wa
true and that it agre with don quixot appear who on hi
part when he found himself roughli handl by thi rascal clown
work up to the highest pitch of wrath and all hi joint crack
with rage with both hand seiz the offic by the throat with all

while don quixot wa talk in thi strain the curat wa
endeavour to persuad the offic that he wa out of hi sens as
thei might perceiv by hi deed and hi word and that thei need not
press the matter ani further for even if thei arrest him and carri
him off thei would have to releas him byandbi as a madman to which
the holder of the warrant repli that he had noth to do with

superior order and that onc taken thei might let him go three
hundr time if thei like
for all that said the curat you must not take him awai thi time
nor will he it is my opinion let himself be taken awai
in short the curat us such argument and don quixot did such mad
thing that the offic would have been more mad than he wa if thei
had not perceiv hi want of wit and so thei thought it best to
allow themselv to be pacifi and even to act as peacemak between
the barber and sancho panza who still continu their alterc with
much bitter in the end thei as offic of justic settl the
question by arbitr in such a manner that both side were if not

find himself now clear and quit of all quarrel hi squir as
well as hi own don quixot consid that it would be advis to

adventur for which he had been call and chosen and with thi high
resolv he went and knelt befor dorothea who howev would not
allow him to utter a word until he had risen so to obei her he rose
and said it is a common proverb fair ladi that dilig is the
mother of good fortun and experi ha often shown in import
affair that the earnest of the negoti bring the doubt case
to a success termin but in noth doe thi truth show itself
more plainli than in war where quick and activ forestal the
devic of the enemi and win the victori befor the foe ha time to
defend himself all thi i sai exalt and esteem ladi becaus it
seem to me that for us to remain ani longer in thi castl now is
useless and mai be injuri to us in a wai that we shall find out
some dai for who know but that your enemi the giant mai have learn
by mean of secret and dilig spi that i am go to destroi him
and if the opportun be given him he mai seiz it to fortifi himself
in some impregn castl or stronghold against which all my effort
and the might of my indefatig arm mai avail but littl therefor
ladi let us as i sai forestal hi scheme by our activ and let
us depart at onc in quest of fair fortun for your high is onli
kept from enjoi it as fulli as you could desir by my delai in
encount your adversari
don quixot held hi peac and said no more calmli await the repli
of the beauteou princess who with command digniti and in a style
adapt to don quixot own repli to him in these word i give
you thank sir knight for the eager you like a good knight to
whom it is a natur oblig to succour the orphan and the needi
displai to afford me aid in my sore troubl and heaven grant that your

her dominion must not think of offer opposit to that which your
wisdom mai ordain
on then in god name said don quixot for when a ladi humbl
herself to me i will not lose the opportun of rais her up and
place her on the throne of her ancestor let us depart at onc for
the common sai that in delai there is danger lend spur to my
eager to take the road and as neither heaven ha creat nor hell
seen ani that can daunt or intimid me saddl rocinant sancho and
get readi thy ass and the queen palfrei and let us take leav of the
castellan and these gentlemen and go henc thi veri instant
sancho who wa stand by all the time said shake hi head ah
master master there is more mischief in the villag than on hear
of beg all good bodi pardon
what mischief can there be in ani villag or in all the citi of the
world you boobi that can hurt my reput said don quixot
if your worship is angri repli sancho i will hold my tongu and
leav unsaid what as a good squir i am bound to sai and what a good
servant should tell hi master
sai what thou wilt return don quixot provid thy word be not
meant to work upon my fear for thou if thou fearest art behav
like thyself but i like myself in not fear
it is noth of the sort as i am a sinner befor god said sancho
but that i take it to be sure and certain that thi ladi who call
herself queen of the great kingdom of micomicon is no more so than my
mother for if she wa what she sai she would not go rub nose
with on that is here everi instant and behind everi door
dorothea turn red at sancho word for the truth wa that her
husband don fernando had now and then when the other were not
look gather from her lip some of the reward hi love had earn
and sancho see thi had consid that such freedom wa more like a
courtesan than a queen of a great kingdom she howev be unabl
or not care to answer him allow him to proce and he continu
thi i sai seor becaus if after we have travel road and
highwai and pass bad night and wors dai on who is now enjoi
himself in thi inn is to reap the fruit of our labour there is no
need for me to be in a hurri to saddl rocinant put the pad on the

quiet and let everi jade mind her spin and let us go to dinner
good god what wa the indign of don quixot when he heard the
audaci word of hi squir so great wa it that in a voic
inarticul with rage with a stammer tongu and ey that flash
live fire he exclaim rascal clown boorish insol and
ignor illspoken foulmouth impud backbit and slander
hast thou dare to utter such word in my presenc and in that of these
illustri ladi hast thou dare to harbour such gross and shameless
thought in thy muddl imagin begon from my presenc thou born
monster storehous of li hoard of untruth garner of knaveri
inventor of scandal publish of absurd enemi of the respect
due to royal personag begon show thyself no more befor me under
pain of my wrath and so sai he knit hi brow puf out hi
cheek gaze around him and stamp on the ground violent with hi
right foot show in everi wai the rage that wa pent up in hi
heart and at hi word and furiou gestur sancho wa so scare and
terrifi that he would have been glad if the earth had open that
instant and swallow him and hi onli thought wa to turn round and
make hi escap from the angri presenc of hi master
but the readywit dorothea who by thi time so well understood don
quixot humour said to mollifi hi wrath be not irrit at the
absurd your good squir ha utter sir knight of the rueful
counten for perhap he did not utter them without caus and from
hi good sens and christian conscienc it is not like that he would
bear fals wit against anyon we mai therefor believ without
ani hesit that sinc as you sai sir knight everyth in thi
castl goe and is brought about by mean of enchant sancho i
sai mai possibl have seen through thi diabol medium what he
sai he saw so much to the detriment of my modesti
i swear by god omnipot exclaim don quixot at thi your
high ha hit the point and that some vile illus must have come
befor thi sinner of a sancho that made him see what it would have
been imposs to see by ani other mean than enchant for i know
well enough from the poor fellow good and harmless that he
is incap of bear fals wit against anybodi
true no doubt said don fernando for which reason seor don
quixot you ought to forgiv him and restor him to the bosom of your
favour sicut erat in principio befor illus of thi sort had
taken awai hi sens
don quixot said he wa readi to pardon him and the curat went for
sancho who came in veri humbl and fall on hi knee beg for
the hand of hi master who have present it to him and allow him
to kiss it gave him hi bless and said now sancho my son thou
wilt be convinc of the truth of what i have mani a time told thee
that everyth in thi castl is done by mean of enchant
so it is i believ said sancho except the affair of the blanket
which came to pass in realiti by ordinari mean
believ it not said don quixot for had it been so i would have
aveng thee that instant or even now but neither then nor now could
i nor have i seen anyon upon whom to aveng thy wrong
thei were all eager to know what the affair of the blanket wa and the
landlord gave them a minut account of sancho flight at which thei
laugh not a littl and at which sancho would have been no less out
of counten had not hi master onc more assur him it wa all
enchant for all that hi simplic never reach so high a pitch
that he could persuad himself it wa not the plain and simpl truth
without ani decept whatev about it that he had been blanket by
be of flesh and blood and not by visionari and imaginari phantom
as hi master believ and protest
the illustri compani had now been two dai in the inn and as it
seem to them time to depart thei devis a plan so that without
give dorothea and don fernando the troubl of go back with don
quixot to hi villag under pretenc of restor queen micomicona
the curat and the barber might carri him awai with them as thei
propos and the curat be abl to take hi mad in hand at home
and in pursuanc of their plan thei arrang with the owner of an
oxcart who happen to be pass that wai to carri him after thi
fashion thei construct a kind of cage with wooden bar larg enough
to hold don quixot comfort and then don fernando and hi
companion the servant of don lui and the offic of the
brotherhood togeth with the landlord by the direct and advic
of the curat cover their face and disguis themselv some in
on wai some in anoth so as to appear to don quixot quit
differ from the person he had seen in the castl thi done in
profound silenc thei enter the room where he wa asleep take hi
rest after the past frai and advanc to where he wa sleep
tranquilli not dream of anyth of the kind happen thei seiz
him firmli and bound him fast hand and foot so that when he awok
startl he wa unabl to move and could onli marvel and wonder at
the strang figur he saw befor him upon which he at onc gave wai
to the idea which hi craze fanci invari conjur up befor him
and took it into hi head that all these shape were phantom of the
enchant castl and that he himself wa unquestion enchant as
he could neither move nor help himself precis what the curat the
concoctor of the scheme expect would happen of all that were there
sancho wa the onli on who wa at onc in hi sens and in hi own
proper charact and he though he wa within veri littl of share
hi master infirm did not fail to perceiv who all these
disguis figur were but he did not dare to open hi lip until he
saw what came of thi assault and captur of hi master nor did the
latter utter a word wait to the upshot of hi mishap which wa
that bring in the cage thei shut him up in it and nail the bar
so firmli that thei could not be easili burst open

rais hi voic to a high pitch and then lower it to such a soft

don quixot wa comfort by the propheci he heard for he at onc

i dont know what to think answer sancho not be as well read
as your worship in errant write but for all that i ventur to sai

cathol said don quixot father of me how can thei be cathol
when thei ar all devil that have taken fantast shape to come and
do thi and bring me to thi condit and if thou wouldst prove it
touch them and feel them and thou wilt find thei have onli bodi of

that devil that goe about there so busili ha firm flesh and
anoth properti veri differ from what i have heard sai devil have
for by all account thei all smell of brimston and other bad smell
but thi on smell of amber half a leagu off sancho wa here
speak of don fernando who like a gentleman of hi rank wa veri
like perfum as sancho said
marvel not at that sancho my friend said don quixot for let me
tell thee devil ar crafti and even if thei do carri odour about
with them thei themselv have no smell becaus thei ar spirit or
if thei have ani smell thei cannot smell of anyth sweet but of
someth foul and fetid and the reason is that as thei carri hell
with them wherev thei go and can get no eas whatev from their
torment and as a sweet smell is a thing that give pleasur and
enjoy it is imposs that thei can smell sweet if then thi
devil thou speakest of seem to thee to smell of amber either thou art
deceiv thyself or he want to deceiv thee by make thee fanci he
is not a devil
such wa the convers that pass between master and man and don

discoveri of their scheme toward which he had alreadi gone some wai
resolv to hasten their departur and call the landlord asid
thei direct him to saddl rocinant and put the packsaddl on
sancho ass which he did with great alacr in the meantim the
curat had made an arrang with the offic that thei should bear
them compani as far as hi villag he pai them so much a dai
cardenio hung the buckler on on side of the bow of rocinant saddl
and the basin on the other and by sign command sancho to mount hi
ass and take rocinant bridl and at each side of the cart he place
two offic with their musket but befor the cart wa put in motion
out came the landladi and her daughter and maritorn to bid don
quixot farewel pretend to weep with grief at hi misfortun and
to them don quixot said
weep not good ladi for all these mishap ar the lot of those who
follow the profess i profess and if these revers did not befal
me i should not esteem myself a famou knighterr for such thing
never happen to knight of littl renown and fame becaus nobodi in
the world think about them to valiant knight thei do for these ar
envi for their virtu and valour by mani princ and other knight
who compass the destruct of the worthi by base mean nevertheless
virtu is of herself so mighti that in spite of all the magic that
zoroast it first inventor knew she will come victori out of
everi trial and shed her light upon the earth as the sun doe upon the
heaven forgiv me fair ladi if through inadvert i have in
aught offend you for intention and wittingli i have never done
so to ani and prai to god that he deliv me from thi captiv to
which some malevol enchant ha consign me and should i find
myself releas therefrom the favour that ye have bestow upon me in
thi castl shall be held in memori by me that i mai acknowledg
recognis and requit them as thei deserv
while thi wa pass between the ladi of the castl and don
quixot the curat and the barber bade farewel to don fernando and
hi companion to the captain hi brother and the ladi now all
made happi and in particular to dorothea and luscinda thei all
embrac on anoth and promis to let each other know how thing
went with them and don fernando direct the curat where to write to
him to tell him what becam of don quixot assur him that there
wa noth that could give him more pleasur than to hear of it and
that he too on hi part would send him word of everyth he thought
he would like to know about hi marriag zoraida baptism don
luiss affair and luscinda return to her home the curat promis
to compli with hi request carefulli and thei embrac onc more and
renew their promis
the landlord approach the curat and hand him some paper sai
he had discov them in the line of the valis in which the novel
of the illadvis curios had been found and that he might take
them all awai with him as their owner had not sinc return for as
he could not read he did not want them himself the curat thank
him and open them he saw at the begin of the manuscript the
word novel of rinconet and cortadillo by which he perceiv that
it wa a novel and as that of the illadvis curios had been
good he conclud thi would be so too as thei were both probabl by
the same author so he kept it intend to read it when he had an
opportun he then mount and hi friend the barber did the same
both mask so as not to be recognis by don quixot and set out
follow in the rear of the cart the order of march wa thi first
went the cart with the owner lead it at each side of it march the
offic of the brotherhood as ha been said with their musket then
follow sancho panza on hi ass lead rocinant by the bridl and
behind all came the curat and the barber on their mighti mule with
face cover as aforesaid and a grave and seriou air measur
their pace to suit the slow step of the oxen don quixot wa seat
in the cage with hi hand ti and hi feet stretch out lean
against the bar as silent and as patient as if he were a stone statu
and not a man of flesh thu slowli and silent thei made it might
be two leagu until thei reach a vallei which the carter thought a
conveni place for rest and feed hi oxen and he said so to
the curat but the barber wa of opinion that thei ought to push on a
littl farther as at the other side of a hill which appear close by
he knew there wa a vallei that had more grass and much better than the
on where thei propos to halt and hi advic wa taken and thei
continu their journei
just at that moment the curat look back saw come on behind them
six or seven mount men well found and equip who soon overtook
them for thei were travel not at the sluggish deliber pace of
oxen but like men who rode canon mule and in hast to take their
noontid rest as soon as possibl at the inn which wa in sight not a
leagu off the quick travel came up with the slow and courteou
salut were exchang and on of the new comer who wa in
fact a canon of toledo and master of the other who accompani him
observ the regular order of the process the cart the offic
sancho rocinant the curat and the barber and abov all don quixot
cage and confin could not help ask what wa the mean of
carri the man in that fashion though from the badg of the
offic he alreadi conclud that he must be some desper
highwayman or other malefactor whose punish fell within the
jurisdict of the holi brotherhood on of the offic to whom he
had put the question repli let the gentleman himself tell you the
mean of hi go thi wai seor for we do not know
don quixot overheard the convers and said hapli gentlemen you
ar vers and learn in matter of errant chivalri becaus if you
ar i will tell you my misfortun if not there is no good in my
give myself the troubl of relat them but here the curat and
the barber see that the travel were engag in convers
with don quixot came forward in order to answer in such a wai as to
save their stratagem from be discov
the canon repli to don quixot said in truth brother i know
more about book of chivalri than i do about villalpando element of
logic so if that be all you mai safe tell me what you pleas
in god name then seor repli don quixot if that be so i
would have you know that i am held enchant in thi cage by the envi
and fraud of wick enchant for virtu is more persecut by the
wick than love by the good i am a knighterr and not on of
those whose name fame ha never thought of immortalis in her
record but of those who in defianc and in spite of envi itself and
all the magician that persia or brahman that india or gymnosophist
that ethiopia ever produc will place their name in the templ of
immort to serv as exampl and pattern for ag to come
wherebi knightserr mai see the footstep in which thei must tread
if thei would attain the summit and crown point of honour in arm
what seor don quixot of la mancha sai observ the curat is
the truth for he goe enchant in thi cart not from ani fault or
sin of hi but becaus of the malevol of those to whom virtu is
odiou and valour hate thi seor is the knight of the rueful
counten if you have ever heard him name whose valiant
achiev and mighti deed shall be written on last brass and
imperish marbl notwithstand all the effort of envi to obscur
them and malic to hide them
when the canon heard both the prison and the man who wa at liberti
talk in such a strain he wa readi to cross himself in hi
astonish and could not make out what had befallen him and all hi
attend were in the same state of amaz
at thi point sancho panza who had drawn near to hear the
convers said in order to make everyth plain well sir you
mai like or dislik what i am go to sai but the fact of the matter
is my master don quixot is just as much enchant as my mother he
is in hi full sens he eat and he drink and he ha hi call like
other men and as he had yesterdai befor thei cage him and if that
the case what do thei mean by want me to believ that he is
enchant for i have heard mani a on sai that enchant peopl
neither eat nor sleep nor talk and my master if you dont stop him
will talk more than thirti lawyer then turn to the curat he
exclaim ah seor curat seor curat do you think i dont know
you do you think i dont guess and see the drift of these new
enchant well then i can tell you i know you for all your face
is cover and i can tell you i am up to you howev you mai hide
your trick after all where envi reign virtu cannot live and where
there is niggardli there can be no liber ill betid the
devil if it had not been for your worship my master would be marri
to the princess micomicona thi minut and i should be a count at
least for no less wa to be expect as well from the good of my
master him of the rueful counten as from the great of my
servic but i see now how true it is what thei sai in these part
that the wheel of fortun turn faster than a millwheel and that
those who were up yesterdai ar down todai i am sorri for my wife and
children for when thei might fairli and reason expect to see their
father return to them a governor or viceroi of some island or kingdom
thei will see him come back a horseboi i have said all thi seor
curat onli to urg your patern to lai to your conscienc your
illtreat of my master and have a care that god doe not call you
to account in anoth life for make a prison of him in thi wai
and charg against you all the succour and good deed that my lord don
quixot leav undon while he is shut up
trim those lamp there exclaim the barber at thi so you ar of
the same fratern as your master too sancho by god i begin to see
that you will have to keep him compani in the cage and be enchant
like him for have caught some of hi humour and chivalri it wa an
evil hour when you let yourself be got with child by hi promis and
that island you long so much for found it wai into your head
i am not with child by anyon return sancho nor am i a man to
let myself be got with child if it wa by the king himself though i
am poor i am an old christian and i ow noth to nobodi and if i
long for an island other peopl long for wors each of us is the son
of hi own work and be a man i mai come to be pope not to sai
governor of an island especi as my master mai win so mani that he
will not know whom to give them to mind how you talk master barber
for shave is not everyth and there is some differ between
peter and peter i sai thi becaus we all know on anoth and it
will not do to throw fals dice with me and as to the enchant of
my master god know the truth leav it as it is it onli make it
wors to stir it
the barber did not care to answer sancho lest by hi plain speak he
should disclos what the curat and he himself were try so hard to
conceal and under the same apprehens the curat had ask the canon
to ride on a littl in advanc so that he might tell him the mysteri
of thi man in the cage and other thing that would amus him the
canon agre and go on ahead with hi servant listen with
attent to the account of the charact life mad and wai of
don quixot given him by the curat who describ to him briefli the
begin and origin of hi craze and told him the whole stori of hi
adventur up to hi be confin in the cage togeth with the plan
thei had of take him home to try if by ani mean thei could discov
a cure for hi mad the canon and hi servant were surpris anew
when thei heard don quixot strang stori and when it wa finish
he said to tell the truth seor curat i for my part consid what
thei call book of chivalri to be mischiev to the state and though
led by idl and fals tast i have read the begin of almost all
that have been print i never could manag to read ani on of them
from begin to end for it seem to me thei ar all more or less the
same thing and on ha noth more in it than anoth thi no more
than that and in my opinion thi sort of write and composit is of
the same speci as the fabl thei call the milesian nonsens
tale that aim sole at give amus and not instruct exactli
the opposit of the apologu fabl which amus and instruct at the
same time and though it mai be the chief object of such book to
amus i do not know how thei can succe when thei ar so full of
such monstrou nonsens for the enjoy the mind feel must come
from the beauti and harmoni which it perceiv or contempl in the
thing that the ey or the imagin bring befor it and noth
that ha ani ugli or disproport about it can give ani pleasur
what beauti then or what proport of the part to the whole or of
the whole to the part can there be in a book or fabl where a lad of
sixteen cut down a giant as tall as a tower and make two halv of
him as if he wa an almond cake and when thei want to give us a
pictur of a battl after have told us that there ar a million of
combat on the side of the enemi let the hero of the book be
oppos to them and we have perforc to believ whether we like it or
not that the said knight win the victori by the singl might of hi
strong arm and then what shall we sai of the facil with which a
born queen or empress will give herself over into the arm of some
unknown wander knight what mind that is not wholli barbar and
uncultur can find pleasur in read of how a great tower full of
knight sail awai across the sea like a ship with a fair wind and
will be tonight in lombardi and tomorrow morn in the land of
prester john of the indi or some other that ptolemi never describ
nor marco polo saw and if in answer to thi i am told that the
author of book of the kind write them as fiction and therefor ar
not bound to regard niceti of truth i would repli that fiction is
all the better the more it look like truth and give the more
pleasur the more probabl and possibl there is about it plot
in fiction should be wed to the understand of the reader and be
construct in such a wai that reconcil imposs smooth
over difficulti keep the mind on the alert thei mai surpris
interest divert and entertain so that wonder and delight join mai
keep pace on with the other all which he will fail to effect who
shun verisimilitud and truth to natur wherein li the perfect
of write i have never yet seen ani book of chivalri that put
togeth a connect plot complet in all it number so that the
middl agre with the begin and the end with the begin and
middl on the contrari thei construct them with such a multitud of
member that it seem as though thei meant to produc a chimera or
monster rather than a wellproport figur and besid all thi
thei ar harsh in their style incred in their achiev
licenti in their amour uncouth in their courtli speech prolix
in their battl silli in their argument absurd in their travel
and in short want in everyth like intellig art for which
reason thei deserv to be banish from the christian commonwealth as a
worthless breed

the curat listen to him attent and felt that he wa a man of
sound understand and that there wa good reason in what he said so
he told him that be of the same opinion himself and bear a
grudg to book of chivalri he had burn all don quixot which
were mani and gave him an account of the scrutini he had made of them
and of those he had condemn to the flame and those he had spare
with which the canon wa not a littl amus ad that though he had
said so much in condemn of these book still he found on good

chapter xlviii
in which the canon pursu the subject of the book of chivalri with
other matter worthi of hi wit
c48ajpg 80k
full size
it is as you sai seor canon said the curat and for that reason
those who have hitherto written book of the sort deserv all the more
censur for write without pai ani attent to good tast or the
rule of art by which thei might guid themselv and becom as famou
in prose as the two princ of greek and latin poetri ar in vers
i myself at ani rate said the canon wa onc tempt to write a
book of chivalri in which all the point i have mention were to be
observ and if i must own the truth i have more than a hundr sheet
written and to try if it came up to my own opinion of it i show
them to person who were fond of thi kind of read to learn and
intellig men as well as to ignor peopl who care for noth but
the pleasur of listen to nonsens and from all i obtain
flatter approv nevertheless i proceed no farther with it as
well becaus it seem to me an occup inconsist with my
profess as becaus i perceiv that the fool ar more numer
than the wise and though it is better to be prais by the wise few
than applaud by the foolish mani i have no mind to submit myself to
the stupid judgment of the silli public to whom the read of such
book fall for the most part
but what most of all made me hold my hand and even abandon all idea of
finish it wa an argument i put to myself taken from the plai that
ar act nowadai which wa in thi wise if those that ar now in
vogu as well those that ar pure invent as those found on
histori ar all or most of them downright nonsens and thing that
have neither head nor tail and yet the public listen to them with
delight and regard and cri them up as perfect when thei ar so
far from it and if the author who write them and the player who act
them sai that thi is what thei must be for the public want thi and
will have noth els and that those that go by rule and work out a
plot accord to the law of art will onli find some halfdozen
intellig peopl to understand them while all the rest remain blind
to the merit of their composit and that for themselv it is better
to get bread from the mani than prais from the few then my book will
fare the same wai after i have burnt off my eyebrow in try to
observ the principl i have spoken of and i shall be the tailor of
the corner and though i have sometim endeavour to convinc actor
that thei ar mistaken in thi notion thei have adopt and that thei
would attract more peopl and get more credit by produc plai in
accord with the rule of art than by absurd on thei ar so
thoroughli wed to their own opinion that no argument or evid can
wean them from it
i rememb sai on dai to on of these obstin fellow tell me
do you not recollect that a few year ago there were three tragedi
act in spain written by a famou poet of these kingdom which were
such that thei fill all who heard them with admir delight and
interest the ignor as well as the wise the mass as well as the
higher order and brought in more monei to the perform these three
alon than thirti of the best that have been sinc produc
no doubt repli the actor in question you mean the isabella
the phylli and the alexandra
those ar the on i mean said i and see if thei did not observ
the principl of art and if by observ them thei fail to show
their superior and pleas all the world so that the fault doe not
lie with the public that insist upon nonsens but with those who
dont know how to produc someth els the ingratitud reveng
wa not nonsens nor wa there ani in the numantia nor ani to be
found in the merchant lover nor yet in the friendli fair foe nor
in some other that have been written by certain gift poet to their
own fame and renown and to the profit of those that brought them out
some further remark i ad to these with which i think i left him
rather dumbfound but not so satisfi or convinc that i could
disabus him of hi error
you have touch upon a subject seor canon observ the curat
here that ha awaken an old enmiti i have against the plai in
vogu at the present dai quit as strong as that which i bear to the
book of chivalri for while the drama accord to tulli should be
the mirror of human life the model of manner and the imag of the
truth those which ar present nowadai ar mirror of nonsens
model of folli and imag of lewd for what greater nonsens can
there be in connect with what we ar now discuss than for an
infant to appear in swaddl cloth in the first scene of the first
act and in the second a grownup beard man or what greater
absurd can there be than put befor us an old man as a
swashbuckl a young man as a poltroon a lackei us fine languag
a page give sage advic a king ply as a porter a princess who is
a kitchenmaid and then what shall i sai of their attent to the
time in which the action thei repres mai or can take place save
that i have seen a plai where the first act began in europ the second
in asia the third finish in africa and no doubt had it been in
four act the fourth would have end in america and so it would have
been laid in all four quarter of the globe and if truth to life is
the main thing the drama should keep in view how is it possibl for
ani averag understand to be satisfi when the action is suppos
to pass in the time of king pepin or charlemagn and the princip
personag in it thei repres to be the emperor heracliu who enter
jerusalem with the cross and won the holi sepulchr like godfrei of
bouillon there be year innumer between the on and the other
or if the plai is base on fiction and histor fact ar
introduc or bit of what occur to differ peopl and at
differ time mix up with it all not onli without ani semblanc
of probabl but with obviou error that from everi point of view
ar inexcus and the worst of it is there ar ignor peopl who
sai that thi is perfect and that anyth beyond thi is affect
refin and then if we turn to sacr dramaswhat miracl thei
invent in them what apocryph illdevis incid attribut to
on saint the miracl of anoth and even in secular plai thei
ventur to introduc miracl without ani reason or object except that
thei think some such miracl or transform as thei call it will
come in well to astonish stupid peopl and draw them to the plai all
thi tend to the prejudic of the truth and the corrupt of histori
nai more to the reproach of the wit of spain for foreign who
scrupul observ the law of the drama look upon us as barbar
and ignor when thei see the absurd and nonsens of the plai we
produc nor will it be a suffici excus to sai that the chief
object wellord govern have in view when thei permit plai to
be perform in public is to entertain the peopl with some harmless
amus occasion and keep it from those evil humour which
idl is apt to engend and that as thi mai be attain by ani
sort of plai good or bad there is no need to lai down law or bind
those who write or act them to make them as thei ought to be made
sinc as i sai the object sought for mai be secur by ani sort to
thi i would repli that the same end would be beyond all comparison
better attain by mean of good plai than by those that ar not so
for after listen to an artist and properli construct plai the
hearer will come awai enliven by the jest instruct by the seriou
part full of admir at the incid hi wit sharpen by the
argument warn by the trick all the wiser for the exampl
inflam against vice and in love with virtu for in all these wai a
good plai will stimul the mind of the hearer be he ever so boorish
or dull and of all imposs the greatest is that a plai endow
with all these qualiti will not entertain satisfi and pleas much
more than on want in them like the greater number of those which
ar commonli act nowadai nor ar the poet who write them to be
blame for thi for some there ar among them who ar perfectli well
awar of their fault and know what thei ought to do but as plai
have becom a salabl commod thei sai and with truth that the
actor will not bui them unless thei ar after thi fashion and so the
poet tri to adapt himself to the requir of the actor who is to
pai him for hi work and that thi is the truth mai be seen by the
countless plai that a most fertil wit of these kingdom ha written
with so much brillianc so much grace and gaieti such polish
versif such choic languag such profound reflect and in
a word so rich in eloqu and elev of style that he ha fill
the world with hi fame and yet in consequ of hi desir to suit
the tast of the actor thei have not all as some of them have come
as near perfect as thei ought other write plai with such
heedless that after thei have been act the actor have to fly
and abscond afraid of be punish as thei often have been for
have act someth offens to some king or other or insult to
some nobl famili all which evil and mani more that i sai noth
of would be remov if there were some intellig and sensibl person
at the capit to examin all plai befor thei were act not onli
those produc in the capit itself but all that were intend to be
act in spain without whose approv seal and signatur no local
magistraci should allow ani plai to be act in that case actor would
take care to send their plai to the capit and could act them in
safeti and those who write them would be more care and take more
pain with their work stand in aw of have to submit it to the
strict examin of on who understood the matter and so good plai
would be produc and the object thei aim at happili attain as well
the amus of the peopl as the credit of the wit of spain the
interest and safeti of the actor and the save of troubl in
inflict punish on them and if the same or some other person
were authoris to examin the newli written book of chivalri no
doubt some would appear with all the perfect you have describ
enrich our languag with the graciou and preciou treasur of
eloqu and drive the old book into obscur befor the light of
the new on that would come out for the harmless entertain not
mere of the idl but of the veri busiest for the bow cannot be
alwai bent nor can weak human natur exist without some law
amus
the canon and the curat had proceed thu far with their
convers when the barber come forward join them and said to
the curat thi is the spot seor licenti that i said wa a good
on for fresh and plenti pastur for the oxen while we take our
noontid rest
and so it seem return the curat and he told the canon what he
propos to do on which he too made up hi mind to halt with them
attract by the aspect of the fair vallei that lai befor their ey
and to enjoi it as well as the convers of the curat to whom he
had begun to take a fanci and also to learn more particular about the
do of don quixot he desir some of hi servant to go on to the
inn which wa not far distant and fetch from it what eatabl there
might be for the whole parti as he meant to rest for the afternoon
where he wa to which on of hi servant repli that the sumpter
mule which by thi time ought to have reach the inn carri
provis enough to make it unnecessari to get anyth from the inn
except barlei
in that case said the canon take all the beast there and bring
the sumpter mule back
while thi wa go on sancho perceiv that he could speak to hi
master without have the curat and the barber of whom he had hi
suspicion present all the time approach the cage in which don
quixot wa place and said seor to eas my conscienc i want to
tell you the state of the case as to your enchant and that is that
these two here with their face cover ar the curat of our villag
and the barber and i suspect thei have hit upon thi plan of carri
you off in thi fashion out of pure envi becaus your worship
surpass them in do famou deed and if thi be the truth it
follow that you ar not enchant but hoodwink and made a fool of
and to prove thi i want to ask you on thing and if you answer me as
i believ you will answer you will be abl to lai your finger on the
trick and you will see that you ar not enchant but gone wrong in
your wit
ask what thou wilt sancho my son return don quixot for i will
satisfi thee and answer all thou requirest as to what thou sayest
that these who accompani us yonder ar the curat and the barber our
neighbour and acquaint it is veri possibl that thei mai seem to
be those same person but that thei ar so in realiti and in fact
believ it not on ani account what thou art to believ and think is
that if thei look like them as thou sayest it must be that those who
have enchant me have taken thi shape and like for it is easi
for enchant to take ani form thei pleas and thei mai have taken
those of our friend in order to make thee think as thou dost and lead
thee into a labyrinth of fanci from which thou wilt find no escap
though thou hadst the cord of theseu and thei mai also have done it
to make me uncertain in my mind and unabl to conjectur whenc thi
evil come to me for if on the on hand thou dost tell me that the
barber and curat of our villag ar here in compani with us and on
the other i find myself shut up in a cage and know in my heart that no
power on earth that wa not supernatur would have been abl to shut
me in what wouldst thou have me sai or think but that my enchant
is of a sort that transcend all i have ever read of in all the
histori that deal with knightserr that have been enchant so
thou mayest set thy mind at rest as to the idea that thei ar what thou
sayest for thei ar as much so as i am a turk but touch thy desir
to ask me someth sai on and i will answer thee though thou
shouldst ask question from thi till tomorrow morn
mai our ladi be good to me said sancho lift up hi voic and
is it possibl that your worship is so thick of skull and so short of
brain that you cannot see that what i sai is the simpl truth and
that malic ha more to do with your imprison and misfortun than
enchant but as it is so i will prove plainli to you that you ar
not enchant now tell me so mai god deliv you from thi
afflict and so mai you find yourself when you least expect it in
the arm of my ladi dulcinea
leav off conjur me said don quixot and ask what thou wouldst
know i have alreadi told thee i will answer with all possibl
precis
that is what i want said sancho and what i would know and have
you tell me without ad or leav out anyth but tell the
whole truth as on expect it to be told and as it is told by all who
profess arm as your worship profess them under the titl of
knightserr
i tell thee i will not lie in ani particular said don quixot
finish thy question for in truth thou weariest me with all these
assever requir and precaut sancho
well i reli on the good and truth of my master said sancho

aha i have caught you said sancho thi is what in my heart and
soul i wa long to know come now seor can you deni what is
commonli said around us when a person is out of humour i dont know
what ail soandso that he neither eat nor drink nor sleep nor
give a proper answer to ani question on would think he wa
enchant from which it is to be gather that those who do not eat
or drink or sleep or do ani of the natur act i am speak ofthat
such person ar enchant but not those that have the desir your
worship ha and drink when drink is given them and eat when there is
anyth to eat and answer everi question that is ask them
what thou sayest is true sancho repli don quixot but i have
alreadi told thee there ar mani sort of enchant and it mai be
that in the cours of time thei have been chang on for anoth and
that now it mai be the wai with enchant peopl to do all that i do
though thei did not do so befor so it is vain to argu or draw
infer against the usag of the time i know and feel that i am
enchant and that is enough to eas my conscienc for it would weigh
heavili on it if i thought that i wa not enchant and that in a
faintheart and cowardli wai i allow myself to lie in thi cage
defraud multitud of the succour i might afford to those in need
and distress who at thi veri moment mai be in sore want of my aid and
protect
still for all that repli sancho i sai that for your greater and
fuller satisfact it would be well if your worship were to try to
get out of thi prison and i promis to do all in my power to help
and even to take you out of it and see if you could onc more mount
your good rocinant who seem to be enchant too he is so melancholi
and deject and then we might try our chanc in look for
adventur again and if we have no luck there will be time enough to
go back to the cage in which on the faith of a good and loyal squir
i promis to shut myself up along with your worship if so be you ar
so unfortun or i so stupid as not to be abl to carri out my
plan
i am content to do as thou sayest brother sancho said don quixot
and when thou seest an opportun for effect my releas i will
obei thee absolut but thou wilt see sancho how mistaken thou art
in thy concept of my misfortun
the knighterr and the illerr squir kept up their convers
till thei reach the place where the curat the canon and the
barber who had alreadi dismount were wait for them the carter
at onc unyok the oxen and left them to roam at larg about the
pleasant green spot the fresh of which seem to invit not
enchant peopl like don quixot but wideawak sensibl folk like
hi squir who beg the curat to allow hi master to leav the cage
for a littl for if thei did not let him out the prison might not be
as clean as the proprieti of such a gentleman as hi master requir
the curat understood him and said he would veri gladli compli with
hi request onli that he fear hi master find himself at
liberti would take to hi old cours and make off where nobodi could
ever find him again
i will answer for hi not run awai said sancho
and i also said the canon especi if he give me hi word as a
knight not to leav us without our consent
don quixot who wa listen to all thi said i give itmoreov
on who is enchant as i am cannot do as he like with himself for he
who had enchant him could prevent hi move from on place for three
ag and if he attempt to escap would bring him back flyingand
that be so thei might as well releas him particularli as it would
be to the advantag of all for if thei did not let him out he
protest he would be unabl to avoid offend their nostril unless
thei kept their distanc
the canon took hi hand ti togeth as thei both were and on hi
word and promis thei unbound him and rejoic beyond measur he wa
to find himself out of the cage the first thing he did wa to stretch
himself all over and then he went to where rocinant wa stand and
give him a coupl of slap on the haunch said i still trust in
god and in hi bless mother o flower and mirror of steed that we
shall soon see ourselv both of us as we wish to be thou with thy
master on thy back and i mount upon thee follow the call for
which god sent me into the world and so sai accompani by
sancho he withdrew to a retir spot from which he came back much
reliev and more eager than ever to put hi squir scheme into
execut
the canon gaze at him wonder at the extraordinari natur of hi
mad and that in all hi remark and repli he should show such
excel sens and onli lose hi stirrup as ha been alreadi said
when the subject of chivalri wa broach and so move by compass
he said to him as thei all sat on the green grass await the arriv
of the provis
is it possibl gentl sir that the nauseou and idl read of
book of chivalri can have had such an effect on your worship as to
upset your reason so that you fanci yourself enchant and the like
all as far from the truth as falsehood itself is how can there be ani
human understand that can persuad itself there ever wa all that
infin of amadis in the world or all that multitud of famou
knight all those emperor of trebizond all those felixmart of
hircania all those palfrei and damselserr and serpent and
monster and giant and marvel adventur and enchant of
everi kind and battl and prodigi encount splendid costum
lovesick princess squir made count droll dwarf love letter
bill and coo swashbuckl women and in a word all that
nonsens the book of chivalri contain for myself i can onli sai that
when i read them so long as i do not stop to think that thei ar all
li and frivol thei give me a certain amount of pleasur but when
i come to consid what thei ar i fling the veri best of them at the
wall and would fling it into the fire if there were on at hand as
richli deserv such punish as cheat and impostor out of the
rang of ordinari toler and as founder of new sect and mode of
life and teacher that lead the ignor public to believ and accept
as truth all the folli thei contain and such is their audac thei
even dare to unsettl the wit of gentlemen of birth and intellig
as is shown plainli by the wai thei have serv your worship when thei
have brought you to such a pass that you have to be shut up in a cage
and carri on an oxcart as on would carri a lion or a tiger from
place to place to make monei by show it come seor don quixot
have some compass for yourself return to the bosom of common sens
and make us of the liber share of it that heaven ha been pleas to
bestow upon you emploi your abund gift of mind in some other
read that mai serv to benefit your conscienc and add to your
honour and if still led awai by your natur bent you desir to read
book of achiev and of chivalri read the book of judg in the
holi scriptur for there you will find grand realiti and deed as
true as thei ar heroic lusitania had a viriatu rome a csar
carthag a hannib greec an alexand castil a count fernan
gonzalez valencia a cid andalusia a gonzalo fernandez estremadura a
diego garca de pared jerez a garci perez de varga toledo a
garcilaso sevil a don manuel de leon to read of whose valiant deed
will entertain and instruct the loftiest mind and fill them with
delight and wonder here seor don quixot will be read worthi of
your sound understand from which you will rise learn in histori
in love with virtu strengthen in good improv in manner
brave without rash prudent without cowardic and all to the
honour of god your own advantag and the glori of la mancha whenc i
am inform your worship deriv your birth
don quixot listen with the greatest attent to the canon word
and when he found he had finish after regard him for some time
he repli to him
it appear to me gentl sir that your worship discours is
intend to persuad me that there never were ani knightserr in the
world and that all the book of chivalri ar fals ly mischiev
and useless to the state and that i have done wrong in read them
and wors in believ them and still wors in imit them when i
undertook to follow the arduou call of knighterrantri which thei
set forth for you deni that there ever were amadis of gaul or of
greec or ani other of the knight of whom the book ar full
it is all exactli as you state it said the canon to which don
quixot return you also went on to sai that book of thi kind had
done me much harm inasmuch as thei had upset my sens and shut me up
in a cage and that it would be better for me to reform and chang my
studi and read other truer book which would afford more pleasur
and instruct
just so said the canon
well then return don quixot to my mind it is you who ar the
on that is out of hi wit and enchant as you have ventur to
utter such blasphemi against a thing so univers acknowledg and
accept as true that whoever deni it as you do deserv the same
punish which you sai you inflict on the book that irrit you
when you read them for to try to persuad anybodi that amadi and all
the other knightsadventur with whom the book ar fill never
exist would be like try to persuad him that the sun doe not
yield light or ic cold or earth nourish what wit in the world
can persuad anoth that the stori of the princess florip and gui of
burgundi is not true or that of fierabra and the bridg of mantibl
which happen in the time of charlemagn for by all that is good it
is as true as that it is daylight now and if it be a lie it must be a
lie too that there wa a hector or achil or trojan war or twelv
peer of franc or arthur of england who still live chang into a
raven and is unceasingli look for in hi kingdom on might just as
well try to make out that the histori of guarino mezquino or of the
quest of the holi grail is fals or that the love of tristram and
the queen yseult ar apocryph as well as those of guinever and
lancelot when there ar person who can almost rememb have seen
the dame quintaona who wa the best cupbear in great britain and
so true is thi that i recollect a grandmoth of mine on the father
side whenev she saw ani dame in a vener hood us to sai to me
grandson that on is like dame quintaona from which i conclud
that she must have known her or at least had manag to see some
portrait of her then who can deni that the stori of pierr and the
fair magalona is true when even to thi dai mai be seen in the king
armouri the pin with which the valiant pierr guid the wooden hors
he rode through the air and it is a trifl bigger than the pole of a
cart and alongsid of the pin is babieca saddl and at roncesval
there is roland horn as larg as a larg beam whenc we mai infer
that there were twelv peer and a pierr and a cid and other
knight like them of the sort peopl commonli call adventur or
perhap i shall be told too that there wa no such knighterr as
the valiant lusitanian juan de merlo who went to burgundi and in the
citi of arra fought with the famou lord of charni mosen pierr by
name and afterward in the citi of basl with mosen enriqu de
remesten come out of both encount cover with fame and honour
or adventur and challeng achiev and deliv also in burgundi
by the valiant spaniard pedro barba and gutierr quixada of whose
famili i come in the direct male line when thei vanquish the son
of the count of san polo i shall be told too that don fernando de
guevara did not go in quest of adventur to germani where he engag
in combat with micer georg a knight of the hous of the duke of
austria i shall be told that the joust of suero de quion him of
the paso and the empris of mosen lui de falc against the
castilian knight don gonzalo de guzman were mere mockeri as well
as mani other achiev of christian knight of these and foreign
realm which ar so authent and true that i repeat he who deni
them must be total want in reason and good sens
the canon wa amaz to hear the medlei of truth and fiction don
quixot utter and to see how well acquaint he wa with everyth
relat or belong to the achiev of hi knighterrantri so he
said in repli
i cannot deni seor don quixot that there is some truth in what you
sai especi as regard the spanish knightserr and i am will
to grant too that the twelv peer of franc exist but i am not
dispos to believ that thei did all the thing that the archbishop
turpin relat of them for the truth of the matter is thei were
knight chosen by the king of franc and call peer becaus thei
were all equal in worth rank and prowess at least if thei were not
thei ought to have been and it wa a kind of religi order like
those of santiago and calatrava in the present dai in which it is
assum that those who take it ar valiant knight of distinct and
good birth and just as we sai now a knight of st john or of
alcntara thei us to sai then a knight of the twelv peer becaus
twelv equal were chosen for that militari order that there wa a
cid as well as a bernardo del carpio there can be no doubt but that
thei did the deed peopl sai thei did i hold to be veri doubt in
that other matter of the pin of count pierr that you speak of and
sai is near babieca saddl in the armouri i confess my sin for i am
either so stupid or so shortsight that though i have seen the
saddl i have never been abl to see the pin in spite of it be as
big as your worship sai it is
for all that it is there without ani manner of doubt said don
quixot and more by token thei sai it is inclos in a sheath of
cowhid to keep it from rust
all that mai be repli the canon but by the order i have
receiv i do not rememb see it howev grant it is there
that is no reason why i am bound to believ the stori of all those
amadis and of all that multitud of knight thei tell us about nor
is it reason that a man like your worship so worthi and with so
mani good qualiti and endow with such a good understand should
allow himself to be persuad that such wild crazi thing as ar
written in those absurd book of chivalri ar realli true

but i will not expati ani further upon thi as it mai be gather
from it that whatev part of whatev histori of a knighterr on
read it will fill the reader whoever he be with delight and wonder
and take my advic sir and as i said befor read these book and
you will see how thei will banish ani melancholi you mai feel and rais
your spirit should thei be depress for myself i can sai that sinc
i have been a knighterr i have becom valiant polit gener
wellbr magnanim courteou dauntless gentl patient and have
learn to bear hardship imprison and enchant and though
it be such a short time sinc i have seen myself shut up in a cage like
a madman i hope by the might of my arm if heaven aid me and fortun
thwart me not to see myself king of some kingdom where i mai be abl
to show the gratitud and generos that dwell in my heart for by my
faith seor the poor man is incapacit from show the virtu of
generos to anyon though he mai possess it in the highest degre
and gratitud that consist of disposit onli is a dead thing just
as faith without work is dead for thi reason i should be glad were
fortun soon to offer me some opportun of make myself an emperor
so as to show my heart in do good to my friend particularli to
thi poor sancho panza my squir who is the best fellow in the world
and i would gladli give him a counti i have promis him thi ever so
long onli that i am afraid he ha not the capac to govern hi
realm
sancho partli heard these last word of hi master and said to him
strive hard you seor don quixot to give me that counti so often
promis by you and so long look for by me for i promis you there
will be no want of capac in me to govern it and even if there is i
have heard sai there ar men in the world who farm seigniori pai
so much a year and thei themselv take charg of the govern
while the lord with hi leg stretch out enjoi the revenu thei
pai him without troubl himself about anyth els that what
ill do and not stand haggl over trifl but wash my hand at onc
of the whole busi and enjoi my rent like a duke and let thing
go their own wai
that brother sancho said the canon onli hold good as far as the
enjoy of the revenu goe but the lord of the seigniori must
attend to the administr of justic and here capac and sound
judgment come in and abov all a firm determin to find out the
truth for if thi be want in the begin the middl and the end
will alwai go wrong and god as commonli aid the honest intent of
the simpl as he frustrat the evil design of the crafti
i dont understand those philosophi return sancho panza all i
know is i would i had the counti as soon as i shall know how to govern
it for i have as much soul as anoth and as much bodi as anyon and
i shall be as much king of my realm as ani other of hi and be so i
should do as i like and do as i like i should pleas myself and
pleas myself i should be content and when on is content he ha
noth more to desir and when on ha noth more to desir there
is an end of it so let the counti come and god be with you and let
us see on anoth as on blind man said to the other
that is not bad philosophi thou art talk sancho said the canon
but for all that there is a good deal to be said on thi matter of
counti
to which don quixot return i know not what more there is to be
said i onli guid myself by the exampl set me by the great amadi of
gaul when he made hi squir count of the insula firm and so
without ani scrupl of conscienc i can make a count of sancho panza
for he is on of the best squir that ever knighterr had
the canon wa astonish at the method nonsens if nonsens be
capabl of method that don quixot utter at the wai in which he had
describ the adventur of the knight of the lake at the impress
that the deliber li of the book he read had made upon him and
lastli he marvel at the simplic of sancho who desir so eagerli
to obtain the counti hi master had promis him
by thi time the canon servant who had gone to the inn to fetch the
sumpter mule had return and make a carpet and the green grass of
the meadow serv as a tabl thei seat themselv in the shade of
some tree and made their repast there that the carter might not be
depriv of the advantag of the spot as ha been alreadi said as
thei were eat thei suddenli heard a loud nois and the sound of a
bell that seem to come from among some brambl and thick bush that
were close by and the same instant thei observ a beauti goat
spot all over black white and brown spring out of the thicket
with a goatherd after it call to it and utter the usual cri to
make it stop or turn back to the fold the fugit goat scare and
frighten ran toward the compani as if seek their protect and
then stood still and the goatherd come up seiz it by the horn and
began to talk to it as if it were possess of reason and
understand ah wander wander spotti spotti how have you
gone limp all thi time what wolv have frighten you my
daughter wont you tell me what is the matter my beauti but what
els can it be except that you ar a she and cannot keep quiet a
plagu on your humour and the humour of those you take after come
back come back my darl and if you will not be so happi at ani
rate you will be safe in the fold or with your companion for if you
who ought to keep and lead them go wander astrai what will becom
of them
the goatherd talk amus all who heard it but especi the canon
who said to him as you live brother take it easi and be not in
such a hurri to drive thi goat back to the fold for be a femal
as you sai she will follow her natur instinct in spite of all you
can do to prevent it take thi morsel and drink a sup and that will
sooth your irrit and in the meantim the goat will rest
herself and so sai he hand him the loin of a cold rabbit on a
fork
the goatherd took it with thank and drank and calm himself and
then said i should be sorri if your worship were to take me for a
simpleton for have spoken so serious as i did to thi anim but
the truth is there is a certain mysteri in the word i us i am a
clown but not so much of on but that i know how to behav to men and
to beast
that i can well believ said the curat for i know alreadi by
experi that the wood breed men of learn and shepherd hut
harbour philosoph
at all event seor return the goatherd thei shelter men of
experi and that you mai see the truth of thi and grasp it though
i mai seem to put myself forward without be ask i will if it
will not tire you gentlemen and you will give me your attent for a
littl tell you a true stori which will confirm thi gentleman word
and he point to the curat as well as my own
to thi don quixot repli see that thi affair ha a certain
colour of chivalri about it i for my part brother will hear you most
gladli and so will all these gentlemen from the high intellig
thei possess and their love of curiou novelti that interest charm
and entertain the mind as i feel quit sure your stori will do so
begin friend for we ar all prepar to listen
i draw my stake said sancho and will retreat with thi pasti to
the brook there where i mean to victual myself for three dai for i
have heard my lord don quixot sai that a knighterr squir
should eat until he can hold no more whenev he ha the chanc
becaus it often happen them to get by accid into a wood so thick
that thei cannot find a wai out of it for six dai and if the man is
not well fill or hi alforja well store there he mai stai as veri
often he doe turn into a dri mummi
thou art in the right of it sancho said don quixot go where thou
wilt and eat all thou canst for i have had enough and onli want to
give my mind it refresh as i shall by listen to thi good
fellow stori
it is what we shall all do said the canon and then beg the
goatherd to begin the promis tale
the goatherd gave the goat which he held by the horn a coupl of slap
on the back sai lie down here besid me spotti for we have time
enough to return to our fold the goat seem to understand him for
as her master seat himself she stretch herself quietli besid him
and look up in hi face to show him she wa all attent to what he

the goatherd tale gave great satisfact to all the hearer and the

attent the manner in which it had been told which wa as unlik the
manner of a clownish goatherd as it wa like that of a polish citi
wit and he observ that the curat had been quit right in sai
that the wood bred men of learn thei all offer their servic to
eugenio but he who show himself most liber in thi wai wa don
quixot who said to him most assuredli brother goatherd if i found
myself in a posit to attempt ani adventur i would thi veri
instant set out on your behalf and would rescu leandra from that
convent where no doubt she is kept against her will in spite of the
abbess and all who might try to prevent me and would place her in your
hand to deal with her accord to your will and pleasur observ
howev the law of chivalri which lai down that no violenc of ani
kind is to be offer to ani damsel but i trust in god our lord that
the might of on malign enchant mai not prove so great but that
the power of anoth better dispos mai prove superior to it and then
i promis you my support and assist as i am bound to do by my

of damsel the terror of giant and the winner of battl
that said the goatherd sound like what on read in the book of
the knightserr who did all that you sai thi man doe though it
is my belief that either you ar joke or els thi gentleman ha
empti lodg in hi head
you ar a great scoundrel said don quixot and it is you who ar
empti and a fool i am fuller than ever wa the whoreson bitch that
bore you and pass from word to deed he caught up a loaf that
wa near him and sent it full in the goatherd face with such forc
that he flatten hi nose but the goatherd who did not understand
joke and found himself roughli handl in such good earnest pai
no respect to carpet tablecloth or diner sprang upon don quixot
and seiz him by the throat with both hand would no doubt have
throttl him had not sancho panza that instant come to the rescu
and grasp him by the shoulder flung him down on the tabl smash
plate break glass and upset and scatter everyth on

tire of pummel and be pummel releas him at onc and don
quixot rise to hi feet and turn hi ey to the quarter where
the sound had been heard suddenli saw come down the slope of a hill

the penit without reflect how often he had seen it befor took
it into hi head that thi wa a case of adventur and that it fell to
him alon as a knighterr to engag in it and he wa all the more
confirm in thi notion by the idea that an imag drape in black
thei had with them wa some illustri ladi that these villain and
discourt thiev were carri off by forc as soon as thi
occur to him he ran with all speed to rocinant who wa graze at
larg and take the bridl and the buckler from the saddlebow he
had him bridl in an instant and call to sancho for hi sword he

their power nor did he even stop for the shout of sancho call
after him where ar you go seor don quixot what devil have

dont know what you ar about sancho labour in vain for hi master
wa so bent on come to quarter with these sheet figur and
releas the ladi in black that he did not hear a word and even had
he heard he would not have turn back if the king had order him he
came up with the process and rein in rocinant who wa alreadi
anxiou enough to slacken speed a littl and in a hoars excit
voic he exclaim you who hide your face perhap becaus you ar
not good subject pai attent and listen to what i am about to sai
to you the first to halt were those who were carri the imag and

reason we should stop to hear anyth unless inde it is short

aspect show plainli that ye ar carri her off against her will and
that ye have commit some scandal outrag against her and i who

a mighti cut don quixot made at him that sever it in two but with
the portion that remain in hi hand he dealt such a thwack on the
shoulder of don quixot sword arm which the buckler could not
protect against the clownish assault that poor don quixot came to the

sancho panza who wa come on close behind puf and blow

god bless me gentl or it mai be plebeian reader how eagerli must
thou be look forward to thi prefac expect to find there
retali scold and abus against the author of the second don
quixotei mean him who wa thei sai begotten at tordesilla and born
at tarragona well then the truth is i am not go to give thee that
satisfact for though injuri stir up anger in humbler breast in
mine the rule must admit of an except thou wouldst have me call him
ass fool and malapert but i have no such intent let hi offenc
be hi punish with hi bread let him eat it and there an end of
it what i cannot help take amiss is that he charg me with be
old and onehand as if it had been in my power to keep time from
pass over me or as if the loss of my hand had been brought about in
some tavern and not on the grandest occas the past or present ha
seen or the futur can hope to see if my wound have no beauti to the
behold ey thei ar at least honour in the estim of
those who know where thei were receiv for the soldier show to
greater advantag dead in battl than aliv in flight and so strongli
is thi my feel that if now it were propos to perform an
imposs for me i would rather have had my share in that mighti
action than be free from my wound thi minut without have been
present at it those the soldier show on hi face and breast ar star
that direct other to the heaven of honour and ambit of merit
prais and moreov it is to be observ that it is not with grei
hair that on write but with the understand and that commonli
improv with year i take it amiss too that he call me enviou
and explain to me as if i were ignor what envi is for realli and
truli of the two kind there ar i onli know that which is holi
nobl and highmind and if that be so as it is i am not like to
attack a priest abov all if in addit he hold the rank of
familiar of the holi offic and if he said what he did on account of
him on whose behalf it seem he spoke he is entir mistaken for i
worship the geniu of that person and admir hi work and hi
unceas and strenuou industri after all i am grate to thi
gentleman the author for sai that my novel ar more satir
than exemplari but that thei ar good for thei could not be that
unless there wa a littl of everyth in them
i suspect thou wilt sai that i am take a veri humbl line and
keep myself too much within the bound of my moder from a
feel that addit suffer should not be inflict upon a
suffer and that what thi gentleman ha to endur must doubtless be
veri great as he doe not dare to come out into the open field and
broad daylight but hide hi name and disguis hi countri as if he
had been guilti of some lese majesti if perchanc thou shouldst come
to know him tell him from me that i do not hold myself aggriev for
i know well what the temptat of the devil ar and that on of the
greatest is put it into a man head that he can write and print a
book by which he will get as much fame as monei and as much monei as
fame and to prove it i will beg of you in your own sprightli
pleasant wai to tell him thi stori
there wa a madman in sevil who took to on of the drollest
absurd and vagari that ever madman in the world gave wai to it
wa thi he made a tube of reed sharp at on end and catch a dog
in the street or wherev it might be he with hi foot held on of
it leg fast and with hi hand lift up the other and as best he
could fix the tube where by blow he made the dog as round as a
ball then hold it in thi posit he gave it a coupl of slap on
the belli and let it go sai to the bystand and there were
alwai plenti of them do your worship think now that it is an
easi thing to blow up a dogdo your worship think now that it is
an easi thing to write a book
and if thi stori doe not suit him you mai dear reader tell him
thi on which is likewis of a madman and a dog
in cordova there wa anoth madman whose wai it wa to carri a piec
of marbl slab or a stone not of the lightest on hi head and when
he came upon ani unwari dog he us to draw close to him and let the
weight fall right on top of him on which the dog in a rage bark
and howl would run three street without stop it so happen
howev that on of the dog he discharg hi load upon wa a
capmak dog of which hi master wa veri fond the stone came down
hit it on the head the dog rais a yell at the blow the master
saw the affair and wa wroth and snatch up a measuringyard rush
out at the madman and did not leav a sound bone in hi bodi and at
everi stroke he gave him he said you dog you thief my lurcher
dont you see you brute that my dog is a lurcher and so repeat
the word lurcher again and again he sent the madman awai beaten to a
jelli the madman took the lesson to heart and vanish and for more
than a month never onc show himself in public but after that he
came out again with hi old trick and a heavier load than ever he came
up to where there wa a dog and examin it veri carefulli without
ventur to let the stone fall he said thi is a lurcher ware in
short all the dog he came across be thei mastiff or terrier he
said were lurcher and he discharg no more stone mayb it will be
the same with thi historian that he will not ventur anoth time to
discharg the weight of hi wit in book which be bad ar harder
than stone tell him too that i do not care a farth for the
threat he hold out to me of depriv me of my profit by mean of hi
book for to borrow from the famou interlud of the perendenga i

cide hamet beneng in the second part of thi histori and third
salli of don quixot sai that the curat and the barber remain
nearli a month without see him lest thei should recal or bring
back to hi recollect what had taken place thei did not howev
omit to visit hi niec and housekeep and charg them to be care
to treat him with attent and give him comfort thing to eat and
such as were good for the heart and the brain whenc it wa plain to
see all hi misfortun proceed the niec and housekeep repli
that thei did so and meant to do so with all possibl care and
assidu for thei could perceiv that their master wa now and then
begin to show sign of be in hi right mind thi gave great
satisfact to the curat and the barber for thei conclud thei had
taken the right cours in carri him off enchant on the oxcart as
ha been describ in the first part of thi great as well as accur
histori in the last chapter thereof so thei resolv to pai him a
visit and test the improv in hi condit although thei thought
it almost imposs that there could be ani and thei agre not to
touch upon ani point connect with knighterrantri so as not to run
the risk of reopen wound which were still so tender
thei came to see him consequ and found him sit up in bed in a
green baiz waistcoat and a red toledo cap and so wither and dri
up that he look as if he had been turn into a mummi thei were veri
cordial receiv by him thei ask him after hi health and he
talk to them about himself veri natur and in veri wellchosen
languag in the cours of their convers thei fell to discuss
what thei call statecraft and system of govern correct thi
abus and condemn that reform on practic and abolish
anoth each of the three set up for a new legisl a modern
lycurgu or a brandnew solon and so complet did thei remodel the
state that thei seem to have thrust it into a furnac and taken out
someth quit differ from what thei had put in and on all the
subject thei dealt with don quixot spoke with such good sens that
the pair of examin were fulli convinc that he wa quit recov
and in hi full sens
the niec and housekeep were present at the convers and could
not find word enough to express their thank to god at see their
master so clear in hi mind the curat howev chang hi origin
plan which wa to avoid touch upon matter of chivalri resolv to
test don quixot recoveri thoroughli and see whether it were genuin
or not and so from on subject to anoth he came at last to talk of
the new that had come from the capit and among other thing he
said it wa consid certain that the turk wa come down with a
power fleet and that no on knew what hi purpos wa or when the
great storm would burst and that all christendom wa in apprehens
of thi which almost everi year call us to arm and that hi majesti
had made provis for the secur of the coast of napl and sicili
and the island of malta
to thi don quixot repli hi majesti ha act like a prudent
warrior in provid for the safeti of hi realm in time so that the
enemi mai not find him unprepar but if my advic were taken i would
recommend him to adopt a measur which at present no doubt hi
majesti is veri far from think of
the moment the curat heard thi he said to himself god keep thee in
hi hand poor don quixot for it seem to me thou art precipit
thyself from the height of thy mad into the profound abyss of thy
simplic
but the barber who had the same suspicion as the curat ask don
quixot what would be hi advic as to the measur that he said ought
to be adopt for perhap it might prove to be on that would have to
be ad to the list of the mani impertin suggest that peopl
were in the habit of offer to princ
mine master shaver said don quixot will not be impertin but
on the contrari pertin
i dont mean that said the barber but that experi ha shown
that all or most of the expedi which ar propos to hi majesti
ar either imposs or absurd or injuri to the king and to the
kingdom
mine howev repli don quixot is neither imposs nor
absurd but the easiest the most reason the readiest and most
expediti that could suggest itself to ani projector mind
you take a long time to tell it seor don quixot said the curat
i dont choos to tell it here now said don quixot and have it
reach the ear of the lord of the council tomorrow morn and some
other carri off the thank and reward of my troubl
for my part said the barber i give my word here and befor god
that i will not repeat what your worship sai to king rook or earthli
manan oath i learn from the ballad of the curat who in the
prelud told the king of the thief who had rob him of the hundr
gold crown and hi pace mule
i am not vers in stori said don quixot but i know the oath is
a good on becaus i know the barber to be an honest fellow
even if he were not said the curat i will go bail and answer for
him that in thi matter he will be as silent as a dummi under pain of
pai ani penalti that mai be pronounc
and who will be secur for you seor curat said don quixot
my profess repli the curat which is to keep secret
od bodi said don quixot at thi what more ha hi majesti to do
but to command by public proclam all the knightserr that ar
scatter over spain to assembl on a fix dai in the capit for
even if no more than half a dozen come there mai be on among them who
alon will suffic to destroi the entir might of the turk give me
your attent and follow me is it prai ani new thing for a singl
knighterr to demolish an armi of two hundr thousand men as if
thei all had but on throat or were made of sugar past nai tell me
how mani histori ar there fill with these marvel if onli in an
evil hour for me i dont speak for anyon els the famou don
beliani were aliv now or anyon of the innumer progeni of amadi
of gaul if ani these were aliv todai and were to come face to face
with the turk by my faith i would not give much for the turk
chanc but god will have regard for hi peopl and will provid
someon who if not so valiant as the knightserr of yore at least
will not be inferior to them in spirit but god know what i mean and
i sai no more
ala exclaim the niec at thi mai i die if my master doe not
want to turn knighterr again to which don quixot repli a
knighterr i shall die and let the turk come down or go up when he
like and in as strong forc as he can onc more i sai god know
what i mean but here the barber said i ask your worship to give me
leav to tell a short stori of someth that happen in sevil
which come so pat to the purpos just now that i should like greatli
to tell it don quixot gave him leav and the rest prepar to
listen and he began thu
in the madhous at sevil there wa a man whom hi relat had
place there as be out of hi mind he wa a graduat of osuna in
canon law but even if he had been of salamanca it wa the opinion of
most peopl that he would have been mad all the same thi graduat
after some year of confin took it into hi head that he wa sane
and in hi full sens and under thi impress wrote to the
archbishop entreat him earnestli and in veri correct languag to
have him releas from the miseri in which he wa live for by god
merci he had now recov hi lost reason though hi relat in
order to enjoi hi properti kept him there and in spite of the
truth would make him out to be mad until hi dy dai the
archbishop move by repeat sensibl wellwritten letter direct
on of hi chaplain to make inquiri of the madhous as to the truth of
the licenti statement and to have an interview with the madman
himself and if it should appear that he wa in hi sens to take
him out and restor him to liberti the chaplain did so and the
governor assur him that the man wa still mad and that though he
often spoke like a highli intellig person he would in the end break
out into nonsens that in quantiti and qualiti counterbalanc all the
sensibl thing he had said befor as might be easili test by
talk to him the chaplain resolv to try the experi and
obtain access to the madman convers with him for an hour or more
dure the whole of which time he never utter a word that wa
incoher or absurd but on the contrari spoke so ration that
the chaplain wa compel to believ him to be sane among other
thing he said the governor wa against him not to lose the present
hi relat made him for report him still mad but with lucid
interv and that the worst foe he had in hi misfortun wa hi
larg properti for in order to enjoi it hi enemi disparag and
threw doubt upon the merci our lord had shown him in turn him from
a brute beast into a man in short he spoke in such a wai that he cast
suspicion on the governor and made hi relat appear covet and
heartless and himself so ration that the chaplain determin to take
him awai with him that the archbishop might see him and ascertain for
himself the truth of the matter yield to thi convict the
worthi chaplain beg the governor to have the cloth in which the
licenti had enter the hous given to him the governor again bade
him bewar of what he wa do as the licenti wa beyond a doubt
still mad but all hi caution and warn were unavail to
dissuad the chaplain from take him awai the governor see that
it wa the order of the archbishop obei and thei dress the
licenti in hi own cloth which were new and decent he as soon
as he saw himself cloth like on in hi sens and divest of the
appear of a madman entreat the chaplain to permit him in chariti
to go and take leav of hi comrad the madmen the chaplain said he
would go with him to see what madmen there were in the hous so thei
went upstair and with them some of those who were present
approach a cage in which there wa a furiou madman though just at
that moment calm and quiet the licenti said to him brother think
if you have ani command for me for i am go home as god ha been
pleas in hi infinit good and merci without ani merit of mine
to restor me my reason i am now cure and in my sens for with
god power noth is imposs have strong hope and trust in him
for as he ha restor me to my origin condit so likewis he will
restor you if you trust in him i will take care to send you some good
thing to eat and be sure you eat them for i would have you know i am
convinc as on who ha gone through it that all thi mad of
our come of have the stomach empti and the brain full of wind
take courag take courag for despond in misfortun break down
health and bring on death
to all these word of the licenti anoth madman in a cage opposit
that of the furiou on wa listen and rais himself up from an
old mat on which he lai stark nake he ask in a loud voic who it
wa that wa go awai cure and in hi sens the licenti
answer it is i brother who am go i have now no need to remain
here ani longer for which i return infinit thank to heaven that ha
had so great merci upon me
mind what you ar sai licenti dont let the devil deceiv
you repli the madman keep quiet stai where you ar and you will
save yourself the troubl of come back
i know i am cure return the licenti and that i shall not
have to go station again
you cure said the madman well we shall see god be with you
but i swear to you by jupit whose majesti i repres on earth that
for thi crime alon which sevil is commit todai in releas
you from thi hous and treat you as if you were in your sens i
shall have to inflict such a punish on it as will be rememb for
ag and ag amen dost thou not know thou miser littl
licenti that i can do it be as i sai jupit the thunder
who hold in my hand the fieri bolt with which i am abl and am wont
to threaten and lai wast the world but in on wai onli will i punish
thi ignor town and that is by not rain upon it nor on ani part
of it district or territori for three whole year to be reckon
from the dai and moment when thi threat is pronounc thou free thou
cure thou in thy sens and i mad i disord i bound i will as
soon think of send rain as of hang myself
those present stood listen to the word and exclam of the
madman but our licenti turn to the chaplain and seiz him by
the hand said to him be not uneasi seor attach no import to
what thi madman ha said for if he is jupit and will not send rain
i who am neptun the father and god of the water will rain as often
as it pleas me and mai be need
the governor and the bystand laugh and at their laughter the
chaplain wa half asham and he repli for all that seor
neptun it will not do to vex seor jupit remain where you ar and
some other dai when there is a better opportun and more time we
will come back for you so thei strip the licenti and he wa
left where he wa and that the end of the stori
so that the stori master barber said don quixot which came in
so pat to the purpos that you could not help tell it master
shaver master shaver how blind is he who cannot see through a siev
is it possibl that you do not know that comparison of wit with wit
valour with valour beauti with beauti birth with birth ar alwai
odiou and unwelcom i master barber am not neptun the god of the
water nor do i try to make anyon take me for an astut man for i am
not on my onli endeavour is to convinc the world of the mistak it
make in not reviv in itself the happi time when the order of
knighterrantri wa in the field but our deprav ag doe not deserv
to enjoi such a bless as those ag enjoi when knightserr took
upon their shoulder the defenc of kingdom the protect of
damsel the succour of orphan and minor the chastis of the
proud and the recompens of the humbl with the knight of these
dai for the most part it is the damask brocad and rich stuff
thei wear that rustl as thei go not the chain mail of their armour
no knight nowadai sleep in the open field expos to the inclem
of heaven and in full panopli from head to foot no on now take a
nap as thei call it without draw hi feet out of the stirrup and
lean upon hi lanc as the knightserr us to do no on now
issu from the wood penetr yonder mountain and then tread the
barren lone shore of the seamostli a tempestu and stormi oneand
find on the beach a littl bark without oar sail mast or
tackl of ani kind in the intrepid of hi heart fling himself
into it and commit himself to the wrath billow of the deep sea
that on moment lift him up to heaven and the next plung him into the
depth and oppos hi breast to the irresist gale find
himself when he least expect it three thousand leagu and more awai
from the place where he embark and leap ashor in a remot and
unknown land ha adventur that deserv to be written not on
parchment but on brass but now sloth triumph over energi indol
over exert vice over virtu arrog over courag and theori
over practic in arm which flourish and shone onli in the golden
ag and in knightserr for tell me who wa more virtuou and more
valiant than the famou amadi of gaul who more discreet than palmerin
of england who more graciou and easi than tirant el blanco who more
courtli than lisuart of greec who more slash or slash than don
beliani who more intrepid than perion of gaul who more readi to face
danger than felixmart of hircania who more sincer than esplandian
who more impetu than don cirongilio of thrace who more bold than
rodamont who more prudent than king sobrino who more dare than
reinaldo who more invinc than roland and who more gallant and
courteou than ruggiero from whom the duke of ferrara of the present
dai ar descend accord to turpin in hi cosmographi all these
knight and mani more that i could name seor curat were
knightserr the light and glori of chivalri these or such as
these i would have to carri out my plan and in that case hi majesti
would find himself well serv and would save great expens and the
turk would be left tear hi beard and so i will stai where i am as
the chaplain doe not take me awai and if jupit as the barber ha
told us will not send rain here am i and i will rain when i pleas
i sai thi that master basin mai know that i understand him
inde seor don quixot said the barber i did not mean it in
that wai and so help me god my intent wa good and your worship
ought not to be vex
as to whether i ought to be vex or not return don quixot i
myself am the best judg
hereupon the curat observ i have hardli said a word as yet and i
would gladli be reliev of a doubt aris from what don quixot ha
said that worri and work my conscienc
the seor curat ha leav for more than that return don quixot
so he mai declar hi doubt for it is not pleasant to have a doubt on
on conscienc
well then with that permiss said the curat i sai my doubt is
that all i can do i cannot persuad myself that the whole pack of
knightserr you seor don quixot have mention were realli and
truli person of flesh and blood that ever live in the world on the
contrari i suspect it to be all fiction fabl and falsehood and
dream told by men awaken from sleep or rather still half asleep
that is anoth mistak repli don quixot into which mani have
fallen who do not believ that there ever were such knight in the
world and i have often with diver peopl and on diver occas
tri to expos thi almost univers error to the light of truth
sometim i have not been success in my purpos sometim i have
support it upon the shoulder of the truth which truth is so clear
that i can almost sai i have with my own ey seen amadi of gaul who
wa a man of lofti statur fair complexion with a handsom though
black beard of a counten between gentl and stern in express
spare of word slow to anger and quick to put it awai from him and
as i have depict amadi so i could i think portrai and describ
all the knightserr that ar in all the histori in the world for
by the percept i have that thei were what their histori describ
and by the deed thei did and the disposit thei displai it is
possibl with the aid of sound philosophi to deduc their featur
complexion and statur
how big in your worship opinion mai the giant morgant have been
seor don quixot ask the barber
with regard to giant repli don quixot opinion differ as to
whether there ever were ani or not in the world but the holi
scriptur which cannot err by a jot from the truth show us that
there were when it give us the histori of that big philistin
goliath who wa seven cubit and a half in height which is a huge
size likewis in the island of sicili there have been found
legbon and armbon so larg that their size make it plain that
their owner were giant and as tall as great tower geometri put
thi fact beyond a doubt but for all that i cannot speak with
certainti as to the size of morgant though i suspect he cannot have
been veri tall and i am inclin to be of thi opinion becaus i find
in the histori in which hi deed ar particularli mention that he
frequent slept under a roof and as he found hous to contain him it
is clear that hi bulk could not have been anyth excess
that is true said the curat and yield to the enjoy of
hear such nonsens he ask him what wa hi notion of the featur
of reinaldo of montalban and don roland and the rest of the twelv
peer of franc for thei were all knightserr
as for reinaldo repli don quixot i ventur to sai that he wa
broadfac of ruddi complexion with roguish and somewhat promin
ey excess punctili and touchi and given to the societi of
thiev and scapegrac with regard to roland or rotolando or
orlando for the histori call him by all these name i am of
opinion and hold that he wa of middl height broadshould
rather bowleg swarthycomplexion redbeard with a hairi bodi
and a sever express of counten a man of few word but veri
polit and wellbr
if roland wa not a more grace person than your worship ha
describ said the curat it is no wonder that the fair ladi
angelica reject him and left him for the gaieti liveli and
grace of that buddingbeard littl moor to whom she surrend
herself and she show her sens in fall in love with the gentl
soft of medoro rather than the rough of roland
that angelica seor curat return don quixot wa a giddi
damsel flighti and somewhat wanton and she left the world as full of
her vagari as of the fame of her beauti she treat with scorn a
thousand gentlemen men of valour and wisdom and took up with a
smoothfac sprig of a page without fortun or fame except such
reput for gratitud as the affect he bore hi friend got for
him the great poet who sang her beauti the famou ariosto not care
to sing her adventur after her contempt surrend which probabl
were not over and abov credit drop her where he sai
how she receiv the sceptr of cathai
some bard of defter quill mai sing some dai
and thi wa no doubt a kind of propheci for poet ar also call
vate that is to sai divin and it truth wa made plain for
sinc then a famou andalusian poet ha lament and sung her tear
and anoth famou and rare poet a castilian ha sung her beauti
tell me seor don quixot said the barber here among all those
who prais her ha there been no poet to write a satir on thi ladi
angelica
i can well believ repli don quixot that if sacripant or
roland had been poet thei would have given the damsel a trim for
it is natur the wai with poet who have been scorn and reject
by their ladi whether fictiti or not in short by those whom thei
select as the ladi of their thought to aveng themselv in satir
and libelsa vengeanc to be sure unworthi of gener heart but up
to the present i have not heard of ani defamatori vers against the
ladi angelica who turn the world upsid down
strang said the curat but at thi moment thei heard the
housekeep and the niec who had previous withdrawn from the
convers exclaim aloud in the courtyard and at the nois thei
all ran out

mai evil island choke thee thou detest sancho said the niec
what ar island is it someth to eat glutton and gormandis that
thou art
it is not someth to eat repli sancho but someth to govern
and rule and better than four citi or four judgeship at court
for all that said the housekeep you dont enter here you bag of
mischief and sack of knaveri go govern your hous and dig your
seedpatch and give over look for island or shyland
the curat and the barber listen with great amus to the word of
the three but don quixot uneasi lest sancho should blab and blurt
out a whole heap of mischiev stupid and touch upon point that
might not be altogeth to hi credit call to him and made the other
two hold their tongu and let him come in sancho enter and the
curat and the barber took their leav of don quixot of whose
recoveri thei despair when thei saw how wed he wa to hi crazi
idea and how satur with the nonsens of hi unlucki chivalri and
said the curat to the barber you will see gossip that when we ar
least think of it our gentleman will be off onc more for anoth
flight
i have no doubt of it return the barber but i do not wonder so
much at the mad of the knight as at the simplic of the squir
who ha such a firm belief in all that about the island that i suppos
all the exposur that could be imagin would not get it out of hi
head
god help them said the curat and let us be on the lookout to see
what come of all these absurd of the knight and squir for it
seem as if thei had both been cast in the same mould and the mad
of the master without the simplic of the man would not be worth a
farth
that is true said the barber and i should like veri much to know
what the pair ar talk about at thi moment
i promis you said the curat the niec or the housekeep will
tell us byandbi for thei ar not the on to forget to listen
meanwhil don quixot shut himself up in hi room with sancho and when
thei were alon he said to him it griev me greatli sancho that
thou shouldst have said and sayest that i took thee out of thy
cottag when thou knowest i did not remain in my hous we salli
forth togeth we took the road togeth we wander abroad togeth
we have had the same fortun and the same luck if thei blanket thee
onc thei belabour me a hundr time and that is the onli
advantag i have of thee
that wa onli reason repli sancho for by what your worship
sai misfortun belong more properli to knightserr than to their
squir
thou art mistaken sancho said don quixot accord to the maxim
quando caput dolet etc
i dont understand ani languag but my own said sancho
i mean to sai said don quixot that when the head suffer all the
member suffer and so be thy lord and master i am thy head and
thou a part of me as thou art my servant and therefor ani evil that
affect or shall affect me should give thee pain and what affect thee
give pain to me
it should be so said sancho but when i wa blanket as a member
my head wa on the other side of the wall look on while i wa
fly through the air and did not feel ani pain whatev and if the
member ar oblig to feel the suffer of the head it should be
oblig to feel their suffer
dost thou mean to sai now sancho said don quixot that i did not
feel when thei were blanket thee if thou dost thou must not sai so
or think so for i felt more pain then in spirit than thou didst in
bodi but let us put that asid for the present for we shall have
opportun enough for consid and settl the point tell me
sancho my friend what do thei sai about me in the villag here what
do the common peopl think of me what do the hidalgo what do the
caballero what do thei sai of my valour of my achiev of my
courtesi how do thei treat the task i have undertaken in reviv and
restor to the world the now forgotten order of chivalri in short
sancho i would have thee tell me all that ha come to thine ear on
thi subject and thou art to tell me without ad anyth to the
good or take awai anyth from the bad for it is the duti of loyal
vassal to tell the truth to their lord just as it is and in it
proper shape not allow flatteri to add to it or ani idl defer
to lessen it and i would have thee know sancho that if the nake
truth undisguis by flatteri came to the ear of princ time
would be differ and other ag would be reckon iron ag more
than our which i hold to be the golden of these latter dai profit
by thi advic sancho and report to me clearli and faithfulli the
truth of what thou knowest touch what i have demand of thee
that i will do with all my heart master repli sancho provid
your worship will not be vex at what i sai as you wish me to sai it
out in all it naked without put ani more cloth on it than
it came to my knowledg in
i will not be vex at all return don quixot thou mayest speak
freeli sancho and without ani beat about the bush
well then said he first of all i have to tell you that the common
peopl consid your worship a mighti great madman and me no less a
fool the hidalgo sai that not keep within the bound of your
qualiti of gentleman you have assum the don and made a knight of
yourself at a jump with four vinestock and a coupl of acr of
land and never a shirt to your back the caballero sai thei do not
want to have hidalgo set up in opposit to them particularli
squir hidalgo who polish their own shoe and darn their black
stock with green silk
that said don quixot doe not appli to me for i alwai go well
dress and never patch rag i mai be but rag more from the
wear and tear of arm than of time
as to your worship valour courtesi accomplish and task
there is a varieti of opinion some sai mad but droll other
valiant but unlucki other courteou but meddl and then thei
go into such a number of thing that thei dont leav a whole bone
either in your worship or in myself
recollect sancho said don quixot that wherev virtu exist in
an emin degre it is persecut few or none of the famou men that
have live escap be calumni by malic juliu csar the
boldest wisest and bravest of captain wa charg with be
ambiti and not particularli cleanli in hi dress or pure in hi
moral of alexand whose deed won him the name of great thei sai
that he wa somewhat of a drunkard of hercul him of the mani
labour it is said that he wa lewd and luxuri of don galaor the
brother of amadi of gaul it wa whisper that he wa
overquarrelsom and of hi brother that he wa lachrymos so that o
sancho amongst all these calumni against good men mine mai be let
pass sinc thei ar no more than thou hast said
that just where it is bodi of my father
is there more then ask don quixot
there the tail to be skin yet said sancho all so far is cake
and fanci bread but if your worship want to know all about the
calumni thei bring against you i will fetch you on thi instant who
can tell you the whole of them without miss an atom for last night
the son of bartholomew carrasco who ha been studi at salamanca
came home after have been made a bachelor and when i went to welcom
him he told me that your worship histori is alreadi abroad in book
with the titl of the ingeni gentleman don quixot of la mancha and
he sai thei mention me in it by my own name of sancho panza and the
ladi dulcinea del toboso too and diver thing that happen to us
when we were alon so that i cross myself in my wonder how the
historian who wrote them down could have known them
i promis thee sancho said don quixot the author of our histori
will be some sage enchant for to such noth that thei choos to
write about is hidden
what said sancho a sage and an enchant why the bachelor samson
carrasco that is the name of him i spoke of sai the author of the
histori is call cide hamet berengena
that is a moorish name said don quixot
mai be so repli sancho for i have heard sai that the moor ar
mostli great lover of berengena
thou must have mistaken the surnam of thi cidewhich mean in
arab lordsancho observ don quixot
veri like repli sancho but if your worship wish me to fetch
the bachelor i will go for him in a twinkl

don quixot remain veri deep in thought wait for the bachelor
carrasco from whom he wa to hear how he himself had been put into a
book as sancho said and he could not persuad himself that ani such
histori could be in exist for the blood of the enemi he had
slain wa not yet dry on the blade of hi sword and now thei want to
make out that hi mighti achiev were go about in print for
all that he fanci some sage either a friend or an enemi might by
the aid of magic have given them to the press if a friend in order
to magnifi and exalt them abov the most famou ever achiev by ani
knighterr if an enemi to bring them to naught and degrad them
below the meanest ever record of ani low squir though as he said to
himself the achiev of squir never were record if howev
it were the fact that such a histori were in exist it must
necessarili be the stori of a knighterr be grandiloqu
lofti impos grand and true with thi he comfort himself
somewhat though it made him uncomfort to think that the author wa
a moor judg by the titl of cide and that no truth wa to be
look for from moor as thei ar all impostor cheat and schemer
he wa afraid he might have dealt with hi love affair in some
indecor fashion that might tend to the discredit and prejudic of
the puriti of hi ladi dulcinea del toboso he would have had him set
forth the fidel and respect he had alwai observ toward her
spurn queen empress and damsel of all sort and keep in
check the impetuos of hi natur impuls absorb and wrap up
in these and diver other cogit he wa found by sancho and
carrasco whom don quixot receiv with great courtesi
the bachelor though he wa call samson wa of no great bodili size
but he wa a veri great wag he wa of a sallow complexion but veri
sharpwit somewher about fourandtwenti year of ag with a
round face a flat nose and a larg mouth all indic of a
mischiev disposit and a love of fun and joke and of thi he
gave a sampl as soon as he saw don quixot by fall on hi knee
befor him and sai let me kiss your mightinesss hand seor don
quixot of la mancha for by the habit of st peter that i wear
though i have no more than the first four order your worship is on
of the most famou knightserr that have ever been or will be all
the world over a bless on cide hamet beneng who ha written
the histori of your great deed and a doubl bless on that
connoisseur who took the troubl of have it translat out of the
arab into our castilian vulgar tongu for the univers entertain
of the peopl
don quixot made him rise and said so then it is true that there
is a histori of me and that it wa a moor and a sage who wrote it
so true is it seor said samson that my belief is there ar more
than twelv thousand volum of the said histori in print thi veri
dai onli ask portug barcelona and valencia where thei have been
print and moreov there is a report that it is be print at
antwerp and i am persuad there will not be a countri or languag in
which there will not be a translat of it
on of the thing here observ don quixot that ought to give
most pleasur to a virtuou and emin man is to find himself in hi
lifetim in print and in type familiar in peopl mouth with a good
name i sai with a good name for if it be the opposit then there is
no death to be compar to it
if it goe by good name and fame said the bachelor your worship
alon bear awai the palm from all the knightserr for the moor in
hi own languag and the christian in hi have taken care to set
befor us your gallantri your high courag in encount danger
your fortitud in advers your patienc under misfortun as well as
wound the puriti and contin of the platon love of your worship
and my ladi doa dulcinea del toboso
i never heard my ladi dulcinea call doa observ sancho here
noth more than the ladi dulcinea del toboso so here alreadi the
histori is wrong
that is not an object of ani import repli carrasco
certainli not said don quixot but tell me seor bachelor what
deed of mine ar thei that ar made most of in thi histori
on that point repli the bachelor opinion differ as tast do
some swear by the adventur of the windmil that your worship took to
be briareus and giant other by that of the full mill on
cri up the descript of the two armi that afterward took the
appear of two drove of sheep anoth that of the dead bodi on it
wai to be buri at segovia a third sai the liber of the gallei
slave is the best of all and a fourth that noth come up to the
affair with the benedictin giant and the battl with the valiant
biscayan
tell me seor bachelor said sancho at thi point doe the
adventur with the yanguesan come in when our good rocinant went
hanker after dainti
the sage ha left noth in the inkbottl repli samson he
tell all and set down everyth even to the caper that worthi
sancho cut in the blanket
i cut no caper in the blanket return sancho in the air i did
and more of them than i like
there is no human histori in the world i suppos said don quixot
that ha not it up and down but more than other such as deal with
chivalri for thei can never be entir made up of prosper
adventur
for all that repli the bachelor there ar those who have read
the histori who sai thei would have been glad if the author had left
out some of the countless cudgel that were inflict on seor don
quixot in variou encount
that where the truth of the histori come in said sancho
at the same time thei might fairli have pass them over in silenc
observ don quixot for there is no need of record event which
do not chang or affect the truth of a histori if thei tend to bring
the hero of it into contempt nea wa not in truth and earnest so
piou as virgil repres him nor ulyss so wise as homer describ
him
that is true said samson but it is on thing to write as a poet
anoth to write as a historian the poet mai describ or sing thing
not as thei were but as thei ought to have been but the historian ha
to write them down not as thei ought to have been but as thei were
without ad anyth to the truth or take anyth from it
well then said sancho if thi seor moor goe in for tell the
truth no doubt among my master drub mine ar to be found for
thei never took the measur of hi worship shoulder without do
the same for my whole bodi but i have no right to wonder at that for
as my master himself sai the member must share the pain of the
head
you ar a sly dog sancho said don quixot i faith you have no
want of memori when you choos to rememb
if i were to try to forget the thwack thei gave me said sancho my
weal would not let me for thei ar still fresh on my rib
hush sancho said don quixot and dont interrupt the bachelor
whom i entreat to go on and tell all that is said about me in thi
histori
and about me said sancho for thei sai too that i am on of the
princip presonag in it
personag not presonag friend sancho said samson
what anoth wordcatch said sancho if that to be the wai we
shall not make an end in a lifetim
mai god shorten mine sancho return the bachelor if you ar not
the second person in the histori and there ar even some who would
rather hear you talk than the cleverest in the whole book though there
ar some too who sai you show yourself overcredul in believ
there wa ani possibl in the govern of that island offer you
by seor don quixot
there is still sunshin on the wall said don quixot and when
sancho is somewhat more advanc in life with the experi that
year bring he will be fitter and better qualifi for be a
governor than he is at present
by god master said sancho the island that i cannot govern with
the year i have ill not be abl to govern with the year of
methuselah the difficulti is that the said island keep it distanc
somewher i know not where and not that there is ani want of head in
me to govern it
leav it to god sancho said don quixot for all will be and
perhap better than you think no leaf on the tree stir but by god
will
that is true said samson and if it be god will there will not
be ani want of a thousand island much less on for sancho to
govern
i have seen governor in these part said sancho that ar not to
be compar to my shoesol and for all that thei ar call your
lordship and serv on silver
those ar not governor of island observ samson but of other
govern of an easier kind those that govern island must at least
know grammar
i could manag the gram well enough said sancho but for the mar i
have neither lean nor like for i dont know what it is but
leav thi matter of the govern in god hand to send me
wherev it mai be most to hi servic i mai tell you seor bachelor
samson carrasco it ha pleas me beyond measur that the author of
thi histori should have spoken of me in such a wai that what is said
of me give no offenc for on the faith of a true squir if he had
said anyth about me that wa at all unbecom an old christian
such as i am the deaf would have heard of it
that would be work miracl said samson
miracl or no miracl said sancho let everyon mind how he
speak or write about peopl and not set down at random the first
thing that come into hi head
on of the fault thei find with thi histori said the bachelor is
that it author insert in it a novel call the illadvis
curios not that it is bad or illtold but that it is out of place
and ha noth to do with the histori of hi worship seor don
quixot
i will bet the son of a dog ha mix the cabbag and the basket
said sancho
then i sai said don quixot the author of my histori wa no sage
but some ignor chatter who in a haphazard and heedless wai set
about write it let it turn out as it might just as orbaneja the
painter of beda us to do who when thei ask him what he wa
paint answer what it mai turn out sometim he would paint a
cock in such a fashion and so unlik that he had to write alongsid
of it in gothic letter thi is a cock and so it will be with my
histori which will requir a commentari to make it intellig
no fear of that return samson for it is so plain that there is
noth in it to puzzl over the children turn it leav the young
peopl read it the grown men understand it the old folk prais it in
a word it is so thumb and read and got by heart by peopl of all
sort that the instant thei see ani lean hack thei sai there goe
rocinant and those that ar most given to read it ar the page
for there is not a lord antechamb where there is not a don
quixot to be found on take it up if anoth lai it down thi on
pounc upon it and that beg for it in short the said histori is
the most delight and least injuri entertain that ha been
hitherto seen for there is not to be found in the whole of it even the
semblanc of an immodest word or a thought that is other than
cathol
to write in ani other wai said don quixot would not be to write
truth but falsehood and historian who have recours to falsehood
ought to be burn like those who coin fals monei and i know not
what could have led the author to have recours to novel and
irrelev stori when he had so much to write about in mine no
doubt he must have gone by the proverb with straw or with hai c
for by mere set forth my thought my sigh my tear my lofti
purpos my enterpris he might have made a volum as larg or
larger than all the work of el tostado would make up in fact the
conclus i arriv at seor bachelor is that to write histori or
book of ani kind there is need of great judgment and a ripe
understand to give express to humour and write in a strain of
grace pleasantri is the gift of great genius the cleverest
charact in comedi is the clown for he who would make peopl take him
for a fool must not be on histori is in a measur a sacr thing
for it should be true and where the truth is there god is but
notwithstand thi there ar some who write and fling book
broadcast on the world as if thei were fritter
there is no book so bad but it ha someth good in it said the
bachelor
no doubt of that repli don quixot but it often happen that
those who have acquir and attain a welldeserv reput by
their write lose it entir or damag it in some degre when
thei give them to the press
the reason of that said samson is that as print work ar
examin leisur their fault ar easili seen and the greater the
fame of the writer the more close ar thei scrutinis men famou
for their geniu great poet illustri historian ar alwai or
most commonli envi by those who take a particular delight and
pleasur in criticis the write of other without have produc
ani of their own
that is no wonder said don quixot for there ar mani divin who
ar no good for the pulpit but excel in detect the defect or
excess of those who preach
all that is true seor don quixot said carrasco but i wish such
faultfind were more lenient and less exact and did not pai so
much attent to the spot on the bright sun of the work thei grumbl
at for if aliquando bonu dormitat homeru thei should rememb how
long he remain awak to shed the light of hi work with as littl
shade as possibl and perhap it mai be that what thei find fault with
mai be mole that sometim heighten the beauti of the face that bear
them and so i sai veri great is the risk to which he who print a book
expos himself for of all imposs the greatest is to write
on that will satisfi and pleas all reader
that which treat of me must have pleas few said don quixot
quit the contrari said the bachelor for as stultorum infinitum
est numeru innumer ar those who have relish the said histori
but some have brought a charg against the author memori inasmuch as
he forgot to sai who the thief wa who stole sancho dappl for it is
not state there but onli to be infer from what is set down that
he wa stolen and a littl farther on we see sancho mount on the
same ass without ani reappear of it thei sai too that he forgot
to state what sancho did with those hundr crown that he found in the
valis in the sierra morena as he never allud to them again and
there ar mani who would be glad to know what he did with them or what
he spent them on for it is on of the seriou omiss of the work
seor samson i am not in a humour now for go into account or
explan said sancho for there a sink of the stomach come
over me and unless i doctor it with a coupl of sup of the old stuff
it will put me on the thorn of santa lucia i have it at home and my
old woman is wait for me after dinner ill come back and will
answer you and all the world everi question you mai choos to ask as
well about the loss of the ass as about the spend of the hundr
crown and without anoth word or wait for a repli he made off
home
don quixot beg and entreat the bachelor to stai and do penanc
with him the bachelor accept the invit and remain a coupl
of young pigeon were ad to the ordinari fare at dinner thei talk
chivalri carrasco fell in with hi host humour the banquet came to
an end thei took their afternoon sleep sancho return and their

sancho came back to don quixot hous and return to the late
subject of convers he said as to what seor samson said that
he would like to know by whom or how or when my ass wa stolen i sai
in repli that the same night we went into the sierra morena fly
from the holi brotherhood after that unlucki adventur of the gallei
slave and the other of the corps that wa go to segovia my
master and i ensconc ourselv in a thicket and there my master
lean on hi lanc and i seat on my dappl batter and weari
with the late frai we fell asleep as if it had been on four feather
mattress and i in particular slept so sound that whoever he wa
he wa abl to come and prop me up on four stake which he put under
the four corner of the packsaddl in such a wai that he left me
mount on it and took awai dappl from under me without my feel
it

that is an easi matter said don quixot and it is no new
occurr for the same thing happen to sacripant at the sieg of
albracca the famou thief brunello by the same contriv took hi
hors from between hi leg
dai came continu sancho and the moment i stir the stake gave
wai and i fell to the ground with a mighti come down i look about
for the ass but could not see him the tear rush to my ey and i
rais such a lament that if the author of our histori ha not
put it in he mai depend upon it he ha left out a good thing some
dai after i know not how mani travel with her ladyship the
princess micomicona i saw my ass and mount upon him in the dress
of a gipsi wa that gine de pasamont the great rogu and rascal
that my master and i freed from the chain
that is not where the mistak is repli samson it is that befor
the ass ha turn up the author speak of sancho as be mount on
it
i dont know what to sai to that said sancho unless that the
historian made a mistak or perhap it might be a blunder of the
printer
no doubt that it said samson but what becam of the hundr
crown did thei vanish
to which sancho answer i spent them for my own good and my wife
and my children and it is thei that have made my wife bear so
patient all my wander on highwai and bywai in the servic of
my master don quixot for if after all thi time i had come back to
the hous without a rap and without the ass it would have been a poor
lookout for me and if anyon want to know anyth more about me
here i am readi to answer the king himself in person and it is no
affair of anyon whether i took or did not take whether i spent or
did not spend for the whack that were given me in these journei were
to be paid for in monei even if thei were valu at no more than four
maravedi apiec anoth hundr crown would not pai me for half of
them let each look to himself and not try to make out white black and
black white for each of us is as god made him ay and often wors
i will take care said carrasco to impress upon the author of the
histori that if he print it again he must not forget what worthi
sancho ha said for it will rais it a good span higher
is there anyth els to correct in the histori seor bachelor
ask don quixot
no doubt there is repli he but not anyth that will be of the
same import as those i have mention
doe the author promis a second part at all said don quixot
he doe promis on repli samson but he sai he ha not found
it nor doe he know who ha got it and we cannot sai whether it will
appear or not and so on that head as some sai that no second part
ha ever been good and other that enough ha been alreadi written
about don quixot it is thought there will be no second part though
some who ar jovial rather than saturnin sai let us have more
quixotad let don quixot charg and sancho chatter and no matter
what it mai turn out we shall be satisfi with that
and what doe the author mean to do said don quixot
what repli samson why as soon as he ha found the histori which
he is now search for with extraordinari dilig he will at onc
give it to the press move more by the profit that mai accru to him
from do so than by ani thought of prais
whereat sancho observ the author look for monei and profit doe
he it will be a wonder if he succe for it will be onli hurri
hurri with him like the tailor on easter ev and work done in a
hurri ar never finish as perfectli as thei ought to be let master
moor or whatev he is pai attent to what he is do and i and
my master will give him as much grout readi to hi hand in the wai
of adventur and accid of all sort as would make up not onli on
second part but a hundr the good man fanci no doubt that we ar
fast asleep in the straw here but let him hold up our feet to be shod
and he will see which foot it is we go lame on all i sai is that if
my master would take my advic we would be now afield redress
outrag and right wrong as is the us and custom of good
knightserr
sancho had hardli utter these word when the neigh of rocinant
fell upon their ear which neigh don quixot accept as a happi
omen and he resolv to make anoth salli in three or four dai from
that time announc hi intent to the bachelor he ask hi
advic as to the quarter in which he ought to commenc hi expedit
and the bachelor repli that in hi opinion he ought to go to the
kingdom of aragon and the citi of saragossa where there were to be
certain solemn joust at the festiv of st georg at which he
might win renown abov all the knight of aragon which would be
win it abov all the knight of the world he commend hi veri
praiseworthi and gallant resolut but admonish him to proce with
greater caution in encount danger becaus hi life did not
belong to him but to all those who had need of him to protect and aid
them in their misfortun
there where it is what i abomin seor samson said sancho
here my master will attack a hundr arm men as a greedi boi would
half a dozen melon bodi of the world seor bachelor there is a time
to attack and a time to retreat and it is not to be alwai santiago
and close spain moreov i have heard it said and i think by my
master himself if i rememb rightli that the mean of valour li
between the extrem of cowardic and rash and if that be so i
dont want him to fly without have good reason or to attack when the
odd make it better not but abov all thing i warn my master that
if he is to take me with him it must be on the condit that he is to
do all the fight and that i am not to be call upon to do anyth
except what concern keep him clean and comfort in thi i will
danc attend on him readili but to expect me to draw sword even
against rascal churl of the hatchet and hood is idl i dont set
up to be a fight man seor samson but onli the best and most loyal
squir that ever serv knighterr and if my master don quixot in
consider of my mani faith servic is pleas to give me some
island of the mani hi worship sai on mai stumbl on in these part
i will take it as a great favour and if he doe not give it to me i
wa born like everyon els and a man must not live in depend on
anyon except god and what is more my bread will tast as well and
perhap even better without a govern than if i were a governor
and how do i know but that in these govern the devil mai have
prepar some trip for me to make me lose my foot and fall and
knock my grinder out sancho i wa born and sancho i mean to die but
for all that if heaven were to make me a fair offer of an island or
someth els of the kind without much troubl and without much risk
i am not such a fool as to refus it for thei sai too when thei
offer thee a heifer run with a halter and when good luck come to
thee take it in
brother sancho said carrasco you have spoken like a professor
but for all that put your trust in god and in seor don quixot for
he will give you a kingdom not to sai an island
it is all the same be it more or be it less repli sancho though
i can tell seor carrasco that my master would not throw the kingdom he
might give me into a sack all in hole for i have felt my own puls
and i find myself sound enough to rule kingdom and govern island and
i have befor now told my master as much
take care sancho said samson honour chang manner and perhap
when you find yourself a governor you wont know the mother that bore
you
that mai hold good of those that ar born in the ditch said
sancho not of those who have the fat of an old christian four finger
deep on their soul as i have nai onli look at my disposit is
that like to show ingratitud to anyon
god grant it said don quixot we shall see when the govern
come and i seem to see it alreadi
he then beg the bachelor if he were a poet to do him the favour of
compos some vers for him convei the farewel he meant to take
of hi ladi dulcinea del toboso and to see that a letter of her name
wa place at the begin of each line so that at the end of the
vers dulcinea del toboso might be read by put togeth the
first letter the bachelor repli that although he wa not on of the
famou poet of spain who were thei said onli three and a half he
would not fail to compos the requir vers though he saw a great
difficulti in the task as the letter which made up the name were
seventeen so if he made four ballad stanza of four line each there
would be a letter over and if he made them of five what thei call
decima or redondilla there were three letter short nevertheless he
would try to drop a letter as well as he could so that the name
dulcinea del toboso might be got into four ballad stanza
it must be by some mean or other said don quixot for unless the
name stand there plain and manifest no woman would believ the vers
were made for her
thei agre upon thi and that the departur should take place in
three dai from that time don quixot charg the bachelor to keep it
a secret especi from the curat and master nichola and from hi
niec and the housekeep lest thei should prevent the execut of
hi praiseworthi and valiant purpos carrasco promis all and then
took hi leav charg don quixot to inform him of hi good or evil
fortun whenev he had an opportun and thu thei bade each other
farewel and sancho went awai to make the necessari prepar for

hi limit intellig and sai thing so subtl that he doe not
think it possibl he could have conceiv them howev desir of
do what hi task impos upon him he wa unwil to leav it
untransl and therefor he went on to sai
sancho came home in such glee and spirit that hi wife notic hi
happi a bowshot off so much so that it made her ask him what
have you got sancho friend that you ar so glad
to which he repli wife if it were god will i should be veri
glad not to be so well pleas as i show myself
i dont understand you husband said she and i dont know what you
mean by sai you would be glad if it were god will not to be well
pleas for fool as i am i dont know how on can find pleasur in
not have it
hark ye teresa repli sancho i am glad becaus i have made up my
mind to go back to the servic of my master don quixot who mean to
go out a third time to seek for adventur and i am go with him
again for my necess will have it so and also the hope that
cheer me with the thought that i mai find anoth hundr crown like
those we have spent though it make me sad to have to leav thee and
the children and if god would be pleas to let me have my daili
bread dryshod and at home without take me out into the bywai and
crossroadsand he could do it at small cost by mere will itit is
clear my happi would be more solid and last for the happi i
have is mingl with sorrow at leav thee so that i wa right in
sai i would be glad if it were god will not to be well pleas
look here sancho said teresa ever sinc you join on to a
knighterr you talk in such a roundabout wai that there is no
understand you
it is enough that god understand me wife repli sancho for he
is the understand of all thing that will do but mind sister you
must look to dappl carefulli for the next three dai so that he mai
be fit to take arm doubl hi feed and see to the packsaddl and
other har for it is not to a wed we ar bound but to go round
the world and plai at give and take with giant and dragon and
monster and hear hiss and roar and bellow and howl
and even all thi would be lavend if we had not to reckon with
yanguesan and enchant moor
i know well enough husband said teresa that squireserr dont
eat their bread for noth and so i will be alwai prai to our
lord to deliv you speedili from all that hard fortun
i can tell you wife said sancho if i did not expect to see myself
governor of an island befor long i would drop down dead on the spot
nai then husband said teresa let the hen live though it be with
her pip live and let the devil take all the govern in the world
you came out of your mother womb without a govern you have live
until now without a govern and when it is god will you will go
or be carri to your grave without a govern how mani there ar
in the world who live without a govern and continu to live all
the same and ar reckon in the number of the peopl the best sauc
in the world is hunger and as the poor ar never without that thei
alwai eat with a relish but mind sancho if by good luck you should
find yourself with some govern dont forget me and your children
rememb that sanchico is now full fifteen and it is right he should
go to school if hi uncl the abbot ha a mind to have him train for
the church consid too that your daughter marisancha will not die
of grief if we marri her for i have my suspicion that she is as eager
to get a husband as you to get a govern and after all a daughter
look better ill marri than well whore
by my faith repli sancho if god bring me to get ani sort of a
govern i intend wife to make such a high match for marisancha
that there will be no approach her without call her my ladi
nai sancho return teresa marri her to her equal that is the
safest plan for if you put her out of wooden clog into highheel
shoe out of her grei flannel petticoat into hoop and silk gown out
of the plain marica and thou into doa soandso and my ladi
the girl wont know where she is and at everi turn she will fall into
a thousand blunder that will show the thread of her coars homespun
stuff
tut you fool said sancho it will be onli to practis it for two
or three year and then digniti and decorum will fit her as easili as
a glove and if not what matter let her be my ladi and never mind
what happen
keep to your own station sancho repli teresa dont try to rais
yourself higher and bear in mind the proverb that sai wipe the nose
of your neigbbour son and take him into your hous a fine thing it
would be inde to marri our maria to some great count or grand
gentleman who when the humour took him would abus her and call her
clownbr and clodhopp daughter and spin wench i have not
been bring up my daughter for that all thi time i can tell you
husband do you bring home monei sancho and leav marri her to my
care there is lope tocho juan tocho son a stout sturdi young
fellow that we know and i can see he doe not look sour at the girl
and with him on of our own sort she will be well marri and we
shall have her alwai under our ey and be all on famili parent
and children grandchildren and sonsinlaw and the peac and bless
of god will dwell among us so dont you go marri her in those
court and grand palac where thei wont know what to make of her or
she what to make of herself
why you idiot and wife for barabba said sancho what do you mean
by try without why or wherefor to keep me from marri my
daughter to on who will give me grandchildren that will be call
your lordship look ye teresa i have alwai heard my elder sai
that he who doe not know how to take advantag of luck when it come
to him ha no right to complain if it give him the gobi and now
that it is knock at our door it will not do to shut it out let us
go with the favour breez that blow upon us
it is thi sort of talk and what sancho sai lower down that made the
translat of the histori sai he consid thi chapter apocryph
dont you see you anim continu sancho that it will be well
for me to drop into some profit govern that will lift us out of
the mire and marri marisancha to whom i like and you yourself will
find yourself call doa teresa panza and sit in church on a
fine carpet and cushion and draperi in spite and in defianc of all
the born ladi of the town no stai as you ar grow neither
greater nor less like a tapestri figurelet us sai no more about it
for sanchica shall be a countess sai what you will
ar you sure of all you sai husband repli teresa well for all
that i am afraid thi rank of countess for my daughter will be her
ruin you do as you like make a duchess or a princess of her but i
can tell you it will not be with my will and consent i wa alwai a
lover of equal brother and i cant bear to see peopl give
themselv air without ani right thei call me teresa at my baptism
a plain simpl name without ani addit or tag or fring of don
or doa cascajo wa my father name and as i am your wife i am
call teresa panza though by right i ought to be call teresa
cascajo but king go where law like and i am content with thi
name without have the don put on top of it to make it so heavi that
i cannot carri it and i dont want to make peopl talk about me when
thei see me go dress like a countess or governor wife for thei
will sai at onc see what air the slut give herself onli yesterdai
she wa alwai spin flax and us to go to mass with the tail of
her petticoat over her head instead of a mantl and there she goe
todai in a hoop gown with her broach and air as if we didnt
know her if god keep me in my seven sens or five or whatev
number i have i am not go to bring myself to such a pass go you
brother and be a govern or an island man and swagger as much as
you like for by the soul of my mother neither my daughter nor i ar
go to stir a step from our villag a respect woman should have
a broken leg and keep at home and to be busi at someth is a
virtuou damsel holidai be off to your adventur along with your
don quixot and leav us to our misadventur for god will mend them
for us accord as we deserv it i dont know im sure who fix
the don to him what neither hi father nor grandfath ever had
i declar thou hast a devil of some sort in thy bodi said sancho
god help thee what a lot of thing thou hast strung togeth on
after the other without head or tail what have cascajo and the
broach and the proverb and the air to do with what i sai look
here fool and dolt for so i mai call you when you dont understand
my word and run awai from good fortun if i had said that my
daughter wa to throw herself down from a tower or go roam the
world as the infanta doa urraca want to do you would be right in
not give wai to my will but if in an instant in less than the
twinkl of an ey i put the don and my ladi on her back and
take her out of the stubbl and place her under a canopi on a dai
and on a couch with more velvet cushion than all the almohad of
morocco ever had in their famili why wont you consent and fall in
with my wish
do you know why husband repli teresa becaus of the proverb
that sai who cover thee discov thee at the poor man peopl
onli throw a hasti glanc on the rich man thei fix their ey and if
the said rich man wa onc on a time poor it is then there is the
sneer and the tattl and spite of backbit and in the street
here thei swarm as thick as bee
look here teresa said sancho and listen to what i am now go to
sai to you mayb you never heard it in all your life and i do not
give my own notion for what i am about to sai ar the opinion of hi
rever the preacher who preach in thi town last lent and who
said if i rememb rightli that all thing present that our ey
behold bring themselv befor us and remain and fix themselv on
our memori much better and more forcibl than thing past
these observ which sancho make here ar the other on on
account of which the translat sai he regard thi chapter as
apocryph inasmuch as thei ar beyond sancho capac
whenc it aris he continu that when we see ani person well
dress and make a figur with rich garment and retinu of servant
it seem to lead and impel us perforc to respect him though memori
mai at the same moment recal to us some lowli condit in which we
have seen him but which whether it mai have been poverti or low
birth be now a thing of the past ha no exist while the onli
thing that ha ani exist is what we see befor us and if thi
person whom fortun ha rais from hi origin lowli state these
were the veri word the padr us to hi present height of
prosper be well bred gener courteou to all without seek
to vie with those whose nobil is of ancient date depend upon it
teresa no on will rememb what he wa and everyon will respect
what he is except inde the enviou from whom no fair fortun is
safe
i do not understand you husband repli teresa do as you like
and dont break my head with ani more speechifi and rethor and if
you have revolv to do what you sai
resolv you should sai woman said sancho not revolv
dont set yourself to wrangl with me husband said teresa i speak
as god pleas and dont deal in outofthewai phrase and i sai if
you ar bent upon have a govern take your son sancho with you
and teach him from thi time on how to hold a govern for son
ought to inherit and learn the trade of their father
as soon as i have the govern said sancho i will send for him
by post and i will send thee monei of which i shall have no lack for
there is never ani want of peopl to lend it to governor when thei
have not got it and do thou dress him so as to hide what he is and
make him look what he is to be
you send the monei said teresa and ill dress him up for you as
fine as you pleas
then we ar agre that our daughter is to be a countess said
sancho
the dai that i see her a countess repli teresa it will be the
same to me as if i wa buri her but onc more i sai do as you
pleas for we women ar born to thi burden of be obedi to our
husband though thei be dog and with thi she began to weep in
earnest as if she alreadi saw sanchica dead and buri
sancho consol her by sai that though he must make her a countess
he would put it off as long as possibl here their convers came
to an end and sancho went back to see don quixot and make

while sancho panza and hi wife teresa cascajo held the abov
irrelev convers don quixot niec and housekeep were not
idl for by a thousand sign thei began to perceiv that their uncl
and master meant to give them the slip the third time and onc more
betak himself to hi for them illerr chivalri thei strove by
all the mean in their power to divert him from such an unlucki scheme
but it wa all preach in the desert and hammer cold iron
nevertheless among mani other represent made to him the
housekeep said to him in truth master if you do not keep still
and stai quiet at home and give over roam mountain and vallei
like a troubl spirit look for what thei sai ar call
adventur but what i call misfortun i shall have to make complaint
to god and the king with loud supplic to send some remedi
to which don quixot repli what answer god will give to your
complaint housekeep i know not nor what hi majesti will answer
either i onli know that if i were king i should declin to answer the
numberless silli petit thei present everi dai for on of the
greatest among the mani troubl king have is be oblig to listen
to all and answer all and therefor i should be sorri that ani affair
of mine should worri him
whereupon the housekeep said tell us seor at hi majesti court
ar there no knight
there ar repli don quixot and plenti of them and it is right
there should be to set off the digniti of the princ and for the
greater glori of the king majesti
then might not your worship said she be on of those that without
stir a step serv their king and lord in hi court
recollect my friend said don quixot all knight cannot be
courtier nor can all courtier be knightserr nor need thei be
there must be all sort in the world and though we mai be all knight
there is a great differ between on and anoth for the courtier
without quit their chamber or the threshold of the court rang
the world over by look at a map without it cost them a
farth and without suffer heat or cold hunger or thirst but we
the true knightserr measur the whole earth with our own feet
expos to the sun to the cold to the air to the inclem of
heaven by dai and night on foot and on horseback nor do we onli know
enemi in pictur but in their own real shape and at all risk and
on all occas we attack them without ani regard to childish point
or rule of singl combat whether on ha or ha not a shorter lanc
or sword whether on carri relic or ani secret contriv about
him whether or not the sun is to be divid and portion out and
other niceti of the sort that ar observ in set combat of man to
man that you know noth about but i do and you must know besid
that the true knighterr though he mai see ten giant that not
onli touch the cloud with their head but pierc them and that go
each of them on two tall tower by wai of leg and whose arm ar
like the mast of mighti ship and each ey like a great millwheel
and glow brighter than a glass furnac must not on ani account be
dismai by them on the contrari he must attack and fall upon them
with a gallant bear and a fearless heart and if possibl vanquish
and destroi them even though thei have for armour the shell of a
certain fish that thei sai ar harder than diamond and in place of
sword wield trenchant blade of damascu steel or club stud with
spike also of steel such as i have more than onc seen all thi i
sai housekeep that you mai see the differ there is between the
on sort of knight and the other and it would be well if there were no
princ who did not set a higher valu on thi second or more properli
speak first kind of knightserr for as we read in their
histori there have been some among them who have been the salvat
not mere of on kingdom but of mani
ah seor here exclaim the niec rememb that all thi you ar
sai about knightserr is fabl and fiction and their histori
if inde thei were not burn would deserv each of them to have a
sambenito put on it or some mark by which it might be known as
infam and a corrupt of good manner
by the god that give me life said don quixot if thou wert not my
full niec be daughter of my own sister i would inflict a
chastis upon thee for the blasphemi thou hast utter that all the
world should ring with what can it be that a young hussi that hardli
know how to handl a dozen lacebobbin dare to wag her tongu and
criticis the histori of knightserr what would seor amadi sai
if he heard of such a thing he howev no doubt would forgiv thee
for he wa the most humblemind and courteou knight of hi time and
moreov a great protector of damsel but some there ar that might
have heard thee and it would not have been well for thee in that case
for thei ar not all courteou or mannerli some ar illcondit
scoundrel nor is it everyon that call himself a gentleman that is
so in all respect some ar gold other pinchbeck and all look like
gentlemen but not all can stand the touchston of truth there ar men
of low rank who strain themselv to burst to pass for gentlemen
and high gentlemen who on would fanci were dy to pass for men of
low rank the former rais themselv by their ambit or by their
virtu the latter debas themselv by their lack of spirit or by
their vice and on ha need of experi and discern to
distinguish these two kind of gentlemen so much alik in name and so
differ in conduct
god bless me said the niec that you should know so much
uncleenough if need be to get up into a pulpit and go preach in the
streetsand yet that you should fall into a delus so great and a
folli so manifest as to try to make yourself out vigor when you ar
old strong when you ar sickli abl to put straight what is crook
when you yourself ar bent by ag and abov all a caballero when you
ar not on for though gentlefolk mai be so poor men ar noth of
the kind
there is a great deal of truth in what you sai niec return don
quixot and i could tell you somewhat about birth that would astonish
you but not to mix up thing human and divin i refrain look you
my dear all the lineag in the world attend to what i am sai
can be reduc to four sort which ar these those that had humbl
begin and went on spread and extend themselv until thei
attain surpass great those that had great begin and
maintain them and still maintain and uphold the great of their
origin those again that from a great begin have end in a point
like a pyramid have reduc and lessen their origin great
till it ha come to nought like the point of a pyramid which
rel to it base or foundat is noth and then there ar
thoseand it is thei that ar the most numerousthat have had neither
an illustri begin nor a remark midcours and so will have
an end without a name like an ordinari plebeian line of the first
those that had an humbl origin and rose to the great thei still
preserv the ottoman hous mai serv as an exampl which from an
humbl and lowli shepherd it founder ha reach the height at which
we now see it for exampl of the second sort of lineag that began
with great and maintain it still without ad to it there ar
the mani princ who have inherit the digniti and maintain
themselv in their inherit without increas or diminish it
keep peacefulli within the limit of their state of those that
began great and end in a point there ar thousand of exampl for
all the pharaoh and ptolemi of egypt the csar of rome and the
whole herd if i mai appli such a word to them of countless princ
monarch lord mede assyrian persian greek and barbarian
all these lineag and lordship have end in a point and come to
noth thei themselv as well as their founder for it would be
imposs now to find on of their descend and even should we
find on it would be in some lowli and humbl condit of plebeian
lineag i have noth to sai save that thei mere serv to swell
the number of those that live without ani emin to entitl them to
ani fame or prais beyond thi from all i have said i would have you
gather my poor innoc that great is the confus among lineag
and that onli those ar seen to be great and illustri that show
themselv so by the virtu wealth and generos of their
possessor i have said virtu wealth and generos becaus a great
man who is viciou will be a great exampl of vice and a rich man who
is not gener will be mere a miserli beggar for the possessor of
wealth is not made happi by possess it but by spend it and not
by spend as he pleas but by know how to spend it well the
poor gentleman ha no wai of show that he is a gentleman but by
virtu by be affabl wellbr courteou gentlemann and
kindli not haughti arrog or censori but abov all by be
charit for by two maravedi given with a cheer heart to the
poor he will show himself as gener as he who distribut alm with
bellring and no on that perceiv him to be endow with the
virtu i have name even though he know him not will fail to
recognis and set him down as on of good blood and it would be
strang were it not so prais ha ever been the reward of virtu and
those who ar virtuou cannot fail to receiv commend there ar
two road my daughter by which men mai reach wealth and honour on
is that of letter the other that of arm i have more of arm than of
letter in my composit and judg by my inclin to arm wa
born under the influenc of the planet mar i am therefor in a
measur constrain to follow that road and by it i must travel in
spite of all the world and it will be labour in vain for you to urg
me to resist what heaven will fate ordain reason requir and
abov all my own inclin favour for know as i do the
countless toil that ar the accompani of knighterrantri i know
too the infinit bless that ar attain by it i know that the
path of virtu is veri narrow and the road of vice broad and spaciou
i know their end and goal ar differ for the broad and easi road
of vice end in death and the narrow and toilsom on of virtu in
life and not transitori life but in that which ha no end i know as
our great castilian poet sai that
it is by rug path like these thei go
that scale the height of immort
unreach by those that falter here below
woe is me exclaim the niec my lord is a poet too he know
everyth and he can do everyth i will bet if he chose to turn
mason he could make a hous as easili as a cage
i can tell you niec repli don quixot if these chivalr
thought did not engag all my faculti there would be noth that i
could not do nor ani sort of knickknack that would not come from my
hand particularli cage and toothpick
at thi moment there came a knock at the door and when thei ask
who wa there sancho panza made answer that it wa he the instant the
housekeep knew who it wa she ran to hide herself so as not to see
him in such abhorr did she hold him the niec let him in and hi
master don quixot came forward to receiv him with open arm and the

oh now i have hit it said don quixot thou wouldst sai thou art
so docil tractabl and gentl that thou wilt take what i sai to
thee and submit to what i teach thee
i would bet said sancho that from the veri first you understood
me and knew what i meant but you want to put me out that you might
hear me make anoth coupl of dozen blunder
mai be so repli don quixot but to come to the point what doe
teresa sai
teresa sai repli sancho that i should make sure with your
worship and let paper speak and beard be still for he who bind
doe not wrangl sinc on take is better than two ill give
thee and i sai a woman advic is no great thing and he who wont
take it is a fool
and so sai i said don quixot continu sancho my friend go on
you talk pearl todai
the fact is continu sancho that as your worship know better
than i do we ar all of us liabl to death and todai we ar and
tomorrow we ar not and the lamb goe as soon as the sheep and
nobodi can promis himself more hour of life in thi world than god
mai be pleas to give him for death is deaf and when it come to
knock at our life door it is alwai urgent and neither prayer nor
struggl nor sceptr nor mitr can keep it back as common talk
and report sai and as thei tell us from the pulpit everi dai
all that is veri true said don quixot but i cannot make out what
thou art drive at
what i am drive at said sancho is that your worship settl some
fix wage for me to be paid monthli while i am in your servic and
that the same be paid me out of your estat for i dont care to stand
on reward which either come late or ill or never at all god help me
with my own in short i would like to know what i am to get be it
much or littl for the hen will lai on on egg and mani littl make
a much and so long as on gain someth there is noth lost to be
sure if it should happen what i neither believ nor expect that your
worship were to give me that island you have promis me i am not so
ungrat nor so grasp but that i would be will to have the
revenu of such island valu and stop out of my wage in due
promot
sancho my friend repli don quixot sometim proport mai be
as good as promot
i see said sancho ill bet i ought to have said proport and
not promot but it is no matter as your worship ha understood me
and so well understood return don quixot that i have seen into
the depth of thy thought and know the mark thou art shoot at with
the countless shaft of thy proverb look here sancho i would
readili fix thy wage if i had ever found ani instanc in the histori
of the knightserr to show or indic by the slightest hint what
their squir us to get monthli or yearli but i have read all or the
best part of their histori and i cannot rememb read of ani
knighterr have assign fix wage to hi squir i onli know
that thei all serv on reward and that when thei least expect it
if good luck attend their master thei found themselv recompens
with an island or someth equival to it or at the least thei were
left with a titl and lordship if with these hope and addit
induc you sancho pleas to return to my servic well and good
but to suppos that i am go to disturb or unhing the ancient usag
of knighterrantri is all nonsens and so my sancho get you back to
your hous and explain my intent to your teresa and if she like
and you like to be on reward with me bene quidem if not we remain
friend for if the pigeonhous doe not lack food it will not lack
pigeon and bear in mind my son that a good hope is better than a
bad hold and a good grievanc better than a bad compens i
speak in thi wai sancho to show you that i can shower down proverb
just as well as yourself and in short i mean to sai and i do sai
that if you dont like to come on reward with me and run the same
chanc that i run god be with you and make a saint of you for i shall
find plenti of squir more obedi and painstak and not so
thickhead or talk as you ar
when sancho heard hi master firm resolut languag a cloud came
over the sky with him and the wing of hi heart droop for he had
made sure that hi master would not go without him for all the wealth
of the world and as he stood there dumbfound and moodi samson
carrasco came in with the housekeep and niec who were anxiou to
hear by what argument he wa about to dissuad their master from go
to seek adventur the arch wag samson came forward and embrac him
as he had done befor said with a loud voic o flower of
knighterrantri o shine light of arm o honour and mirror of the
spanish nation mai god almighti in hi infinit power grant that ani
person or person who would imped or hinder thy third salli mai find
no wai out of the labyrinth of their scheme nor ever accomplish what
thei most desir and then turn to the housekeep he said
mistress housekeep mai just as well give over sai the prayer of
santa apollonia for i know it is the posit determin of the
sphere that seor don quixot shall proce to put into execut hi
new and lofti design and i should lai a heavi burden on my conscienc
did i not urg and persuad thi knight not to keep the might of hi
strong arm and the virtu of hi valiant spirit ani longer curb and
check for by hi inact he is defraud the world of the
redress of wrong of the protect of orphan of the honour of
virgin of the aid of widow and of the support of wive and other
matter of thi kind appertain belong proper and peculiar to
the order of knighterrantri on then my lord don quixot beauti

tomorrow and if anyth be need for the execut of your purpos
here am i readi in person and purs to suppli the want and were it
requisit to attend your magnific as squir i should esteem it the
happiest good fortun
at thi don quixot turn to sancho said did i not tell thee

offer to becom on no less than the illustri bachelor samson
carrasco the perpetu joi and delight of the court of the salamancan
school sound in bodi discreet patient under heat or cold hunger or
thirst with all the qualif requisit to make a knighterr

shake or shatter thi pillar of letter and vessel of the scienc and
cut down thi tower palm of the fair and liber art let thi new
samson remain in hi own countri and bring honour to it bring
honour at the same time on the grei head of hi vener parent for
i will be content with ani squir that come to hand as sancho doe
not deign to accompani me

shall not be said of me master mine he continu the bread eaten
and the compani dispers nai i come of no ungrat stock for all
the world know but particularli my own town who the panza from whom
i am descend were and what is more i know and have learn by
mani good word and deed your worship desir to show me favour and
if i have been bargain more or less about my wage it wa onli to
pleas my wife who when she set herself to press a point no hammer
drive the hoop of a cask as she drive on to do what she want but
after all a man must be a man and a woman a woman and as i am a man
anyhow which i cant deni i will be on in my own hous too let who
will take it amiss and so there noth more to do but for your
worship to make your will with it codicil in such a wai that it cant
be provok and let us set out at onc to save seor samson soul
from suffer as he sai hi conscienc oblig him to persuad your
worship to salli out upon the world a third time so i offer again to
serv your worship faithfulli and loyal as well and better than all
the squir that serv knightserr in time past or present
the bachelor wa fill with amaz when he heard sancho
phraseolog and style of talk for though he had read the first part of
hi master histori he never thought that he could be so droll as he
wa there describ but now hear him talk of a will and codicil
that could not be provok instead of will and codicil that could
not be revok he believ all he had read of him and set him down
as on of the greatest simpleton of modern time and he said to
himself that two such lunat as master and man the world had never
seen in fine don quixot and sancho embrac on anoth and made
friend and by the advic and with the approv of the great carrasco
who wa now their oracl it wa arrang that their departur should
take place three dai thenc by which time thei could have all that
wa requisit for the journei readi and procur a close helmet which
don quixot said he must by all mean take samson offer him on as
he knew a friend of hi who had it would not refus it to him though
it wa more dingi with rust and mildew than bright and clean like
burnish steel
the curs which both housekeep and niec pour out on the bachelor
were past count thei tore their hair thei claw their face and
in the style of the hire mourner that were onc in fashion thei
rais a lament over the departur of their master and uncl as
if it had been hi death samson intent in persuad him to salli
forth onc more wa to do what the histori relat farther on all by
the advic of the curat and barber with whom he had previous
discuss the subject final then dure those three dai don
quixot and sancho provid themselv with what thei consid
necessari and sancho have pacifi hi wife and don quixot hi
niec and housekeep at nightfal unseen by anyon except the
bachelor who thought fit to accompani them half a leagu out of the
villag thei set out for el toboso don quixot on hi good rocinant
and sancho on hi old dappl hi alforja furnish with certain
matter in the wai of victual and hi purs with monei that don
quixot gave him to meet emerg samson embrac him and
entreat him to let him hear of hi good or evil fortun so that he
might rejoic over the former or condol with him over the latter as
the law of friendship requir don quixot promis him he would do

delight histori mai reckon that the achiev and humour of don
quixot and hi squir ar now about to begin and he urg them to
forget the former chivalri of the ingeni gentleman and to fix
their ey on those that ar to come which now begin on the road to el

don quixot and sancho were left alon and the moment samson took hi
departur rocinant began to neigh and dappl to sigh which by both
knight and squir wa accept as a good sign and a veri happi omen
though if the truth is to be told the sigh and brai of dappl were
louder than the neigh of the hack from which sancho infer that
hi good fortun wa to exce and overtop that of hi master
build perhap upon some judici astrolog that he mai have known
though the histori sai noth about it all that can be said is that
when he stumbl or fell he wa heard to sai he wish he had not come

so i believ repli sancho but i think it will be difficult for
your worship to speak with her or see her at ani rate where you will
be abl to receiv her bless unless inde she throw it over the
wall of the yard where i saw her the time befor when i took her the
letter that told of the folli and mad thing your worship wa do
in the heart of sierra morena
didst thou take that for a yard wall sancho said don quixot
where or at which thou sawest that never suffici extol grace
and beauti it must have been the galleri corridor or portico of some
rich and royal palac
it might have been all that return sancho but to me it look
like a wall unless i am short of memori
at all event let us go there sancho said don quixot for so
that i see her it is the same to me whether it be over a wall or at a
window or through the chink of a door or the grate of a garden for
ani beam of the sun of her beauti that reach my ey will give light
to my reason and strength to my heart so that i shall be unmatch and
unequal in wisdom and valour
well to tell the truth seor said sancho when i saw that sun of
the ladi dulcinea del toboso it wa not bright enough to throw out
beam at all it must have been that as her grace wa sift that
wheat i told you of the thick dust she rais came befor her face
like a cloud and dim it
what dost thou still persist sancho said don quixot in sai
think believ and maintain that my ladi dulcinea wa sift
wheat that be an occup and task entir at varianc with what
is and should be the employ of person of distinct who ar
constitut and reserv for other avoc and pursuit that show
their rank a bowshot off thou hast forgotten o sancho those line of
our poet wherein he paint for us how in their crystal abod those
four nymph emploi themselv who rose from their love tagu and
seat themselv in a verdant meadow to embroid those tissu which
the ingeni poet there describ to us how thei were work and
woven with gold and silk and pearl and someth of thi sort must
have been the employ of my ladi when thou sawest her onli that the
spite which some wick enchant seem to have against everyth of
mine chang all those thing that give me pleasur and turn them
into shape unlik their own and so i fear that in that histori of my
achiev which thei sai is now in print if hapli it author wa
some sage who is an enemi of mine he will have put on thing for
anoth mingl a thousand li with on truth and amus himself
by relat transact which have noth to do with the sequenc of
a true histori o envi root of all countless evil and cankerworm of
the virtu all the vice sancho bring some kind of pleasur with
them but envi bring noth but irrit bitter and rage
so i sai too repli sancho and i suspect in that legend or
histori of us that the bachelor samson carrasco told us he saw my
honour goe drag in the dirt knock about up and down sweep
the street as thei sai and yet on the faith of an honest man i
never spoke ill of ani enchant and i am not so well off that i am to
be envi to be sure i am rather sly and i have a certain spice of
the rogu in me but all is cover by the great cloak of my
simplic alwai natur and never act and if i had no other merit
save that i believ as i alwai do firmli and truli in god and all
the holi roman cathol church hold and believ and that i am a
mortal enemi of the jew the historian ought to have merci on me and
treat me well in their write but let them sai what thei like nake
wa i born nake i find myself i neither lose nor gain nai while i
see myself put into a book and pass on from hand to hand over the
world i dont care a fig let them sai what thei like of me
that sancho return don quixot remind me of what happen to a
famou poet of our own dai who have written a bitter satir against
all the courtesan ladi did not insert or name in it a certain ladi
of whom it wa question whether she wa on or not she see she
wa not in the list of the poet ask him what he had seen in her that
he did not includ her in the number of the other tell him he must
add to hi satir and put her in the new part or els look out for the
consequ the poet did as she bade him and left her without a
shred of reput and she wa satisfi by get fame though it
wa infami in keep with thi is what thei relat of that shepherd
who set fire to the famou templ of diana by reput on of the seven
wonder of the world and burn it with the sole object of make hi
name live in after ag and though it wa forbidden to name him or
mention hi name by word of mouth or in write lest the object of hi
ambit should be attain nevertheless it becam known that he wa
call erostratu and someth of the same sort is what happen in
the case of the great emperor charl v and a gentleman in rome the
emperor wa anxiou to see that famou templ of the rotunda call in
ancient time the templ of all the god but nowadai by a better
nomenclatur of all the saint which is the best preserv build
of all those of pagan construct in rome and the on which best
sustain the reput of mighti work and magnific of it
founder it is in the form of a half orang of enorm dimens
and well light though no light penetr it save that which is
admit by a window or rather round skylight at the top and it wa
from thi that the emperor examin the build a roman gentleman
stood by hi side and explain to him the skil construct and
ingenu of the vast fabric and it wonder architectur and when
thei had left the skylight he said to the emperor a thousand time
your sacr majesti the impuls came upon me to seiz your majesti in
my arm and fling myself down from yonder skylight so as to leav
behind me in the world a name that would last for ever i am thank
to you for not carri such an evil thought into effect said the
emperor and i shall give you no opportun in futur of again
put your loyalti to the test and i therefor forbid you ever to
speak to me or to be where i am and he follow up these word by
bestow a liber bounti upon him my mean is sancho that the
desir of acquir fame is a veri power motiv what thinkest
thou wa it that flung horatiu in full armour down from the bridg
into the depth of the tiber what burn the hand and arm of mutiu
what impel curtiu to plung into the deep burn gulf that open
in the midst of rome what in opposit to all the omen that
declar against him made juliu csar cross the rubicon and to come
to more modern exampl what scuttl the ship and left strand and
cut off the gallant spaniard under the command of the most courteou
cort in the new world all these and a varieti of other great
exploit ar were and will be the work of fame that mortal desir as
a reward and a portion of the immort their famou deed deserv
though we cathol christian and knightserr look more to that
futur glori that is everlast in the ether region of heaven than
to the vaniti of the fame that is to be acquir in thi present
transitori life a fame that howev long it mai last must after all
end with the world itself which ha it own appoint end so that o
sancho in what we do we must not overpass the bound which the
christian religion we profess ha assign to us we have to slai pride
in giant envi by generos and nobl of heart anger by calm
of demeanour and equanim gluttoni and sloth by the spare of our
diet and the length of our vigil lust and lewd by the loyalti we
preserv to those whom we have made the mistress of our thought
indol by travers the world in all direct seek
opportun of make ourselv besid christian famou knight
such sancho ar the mean by which we reach those extrem of prais
that fair fame carri with it
all that your worship ha said so far said sancho i have
understood quit well but still i would be glad if your worship would
dissolv a doubt for me which ha just thi minut come into my mind
solv thou meanest sancho said don quixot sai on in god
name and i will answer as well as i can
tell me seor sancho went on to sai those juli or august and
all those ventur knight that you sai ar now deadwher ar thei
now
the heathen repli don quixot ar no doubt in hell the
christian if thei were good christian ar either in purgatori or in
heaven
veri good said sancho but now i want to knowth tomb where the
bodi of those great lord ar have thei silver lamp befor them or
ar the wall of their chapel ornament with crutch
windingsheet tress of hair leg and ey in wax or what ar thei
ornament with
to which don quixot made answer the tomb of the heathen were
gener sumptuou templ the ash of juliu csar bodi were
place on the top of a stone pyramid of vast size which thei now call
in rome saint peter needl the emperor hadrian had for a tomb a
castl as larg as a goodsiz villag which thei call the mole
adriani and is now the castl of st angelo in rome the queen
artemisia buri her husband mausolu in a tomb which wa reckon on
of the seven wonder of the world but none of these tomb or of the
mani other of the heathen were ornament with windingsheet or ani
of those other offer and token that show that thei who ar buri
there ar saint
that the point im come to said sancho and now tell me which
is the greater work to bring a dead man to life or to kill a giant
the answer is easi repli don quixot it is a greater work to
bring to life a dead man
now i have got you said sancho in that case the fame of them who
bring the dead to life who give sight to the blind cure crippl
restor health to the sick and befor whose tomb there ar lamp
burn and whose chapel ar fill with devout folk on their knee
ador their relic be a better fame in thi life and in the other
than that which all the heathen emperor and knightserr that have
ever been in the world have left or mai leav behind them
that i grant too said don quixot
then thi fame these favour these privileg or whatev you call
it said sancho belong to the bodi and relic of the saint who
with the approb and permiss of our holi mother church have
lamp taper windingsheet crutch pictur ey and leg by
mean of which thei increas devot and add to their own christian
reput king carri the bodi or relic of saint on their
shoulder and kiss bit of their bone and enrich and adorn their
oratori and favourit altar with them
what wouldst thou have me infer from all thou hast said sancho
ask don quixot
my mean is said sancho let us set about becom saint and we
shall obtain more quickli the fair fame we ar strive after for you
know seor yesterdai or the dai befor yesterdai for it is so late
on mai sai so thei canonis and beatifi two littl barefoot
friar and it is now reckon the greatest good luck to kiss or touch
the iron chain with which thei girt and tortur their bodi and
thei ar held in greater vener so it is said than the sword of
roland in the armouri of our lord the king whom god preserv so that
seor it is better to be an humbl littl friar of no matter what
order than a valiant knighterr with god a coupl of dozen of
penanc lash ar of more avail than two thousand lancethrust be
thei given to giant or monster or dragon
all that is true return don quixot but we cannot all be friar
and mani ar the wai by which god take hi own to heaven chivalri is
a religion there ar saint knight in glori
ye said sancho but i have heard sai that there ar more friar in
heaven than knightserr
that said don quixot is becaus those in religi order ar
more numer than knight
the errant ar mani said sancho
mani repli don quixot but few thei who deserv the name of
knight
with these and other discuss of the same sort thei pass that
night and the follow dai without anyth worth mention happen
to them whereat don quixot wa not a littl deject but at length
the next dai at daybreak thei descri the great citi of el toboso
at the sight of which don quixot spirit rose and sancho fell for
he did not know dulcinea hous nor in all hi life had he ever seen
her ani more than hi master so that thei were both uneasi the on
to see her the other at not have seen her and sancho wa at a loss
to know what he wa to do when hi master sent him to el toboso in the
end don quixot made up hi mind to enter the citi at nightfal and
thei wait until the time came among some oak tree that were near el
toboso and when the moment thei had agre upon arriv thei made
their entranc into the citi where someth happen them that mai
fairli be call someth

twa at the veri midnight hourmor or lesswhen don quixot and
sancho quit the wood and enter el toboso the town wa in deep
silenc for all the inhabit were asleep and stretch on the
broad of their back as the sai is the night wa darkish though
sancho would have been glad had it been quit dark so as to find in
the dark an excus for hi blunder all over the place noth
wa to be heard except the bark of dog which deafen the ear of
don quixot and troubl the heart of sancho now and then an ass
brai pig grunt cat mew and the variou nois thei made
seem louder in the silenc of the night all which the enamour
knight took to be of evil omen nevertheless he said to sancho
sancho my son lead on to the palac of dulcinea it mai be that we
shall find her awak
bodi of the sun what palac am i to lead to said sancho when what
i saw her high in wa onli a veri littl hous
most like she had then withdrawn into some small apart of her
palac said don quixot to amus herself with damsel as great
ladi and princess ar accustom to do
seor said sancho if your worship will have it in spite of me that
the hous of my ladi dulcinea is a palac is thi an hour think you
to find the door open and will it be right for us to go knock till
thei hear us and open the door make a disturb and confus all
through the household ar we go do you fanci to the hous of our
wench like gallant who come and knock and go in at ani hour
howev late it mai be
let us first of all find out the palac for certain repli don
quixot and then i will tell thee sancho what we had best do but
look sancho for either i see badli or that dark mass that on see
from here should be dulcinea palac
then let your worship lead the wai said sancho perhap it mai be
so though i see it with my ey and touch it with my hand ill
believ it as much as i believ it is daylight now
don quixot took the lead and have gone a matter of two hundr
pace he came upon the mass that produc the shade and found it wa a
great tower and then he perceiv that the build in question wa no
palac but the chief church of the town and said he it the church
we have lit upon sancho
so i see said sancho and god grant we mai not light upon our
grave it is no good sign to find oneself wander in a graveyard at
thi time of night and that after my tell your worship if i dont
mistak that the hous of thi ladi will be in an allei without an
outlet
the curs of god on thee for a blockhead said don quixot where
hast thou ever heard of castl and royal palac be built in allei
without an outlet
seor repli sancho everi countri ha a wai of it own perhap
here in el toboso it is the wai to build palac and grand build in
allei so i entreat your worship to let me search about among these
street or allei befor me and perhap in some corner or other i
mai stumbl on thi palaceand i wish i saw the dog eat it for
lead us such a danc
speak respectfulli of what belong to my ladi sancho said don
quixot let us keep the feast in peac and not throw the rope after
the bucket
ill hold my tongu said sancho but how am i to take it patient
when your worship want me with onli onc see the hous of our
mistress to know alwai and find it in the middl of the night when
your worship cant find it who must have seen it thousand of time
thou wilt drive me to desper sancho said don quixot look
here heret have i not told thee a thousand time that i have never
onc in my life seen the peerless dulcinea or cross the threshold of
her palac and that i am enamour sole by hearsai and by the great
reput she bear for beauti and discret
i hear it now return sancho and i mai tell you that if you have
not seen her no more have i
that cannot be said don quixot for at ani rate thou saidst on
bring back the answer to the letter i sent by thee that thou sawest
her sift wheat
dont mind that seor said sancho i must tell you that my see
her and the answer i brought you back were by hearsai too for i can no
more tell who the ladi dulcinea is than i can hit the sky
sancho sancho said don quixot there ar time for jest and
time when jest ar out of place if i tell thee that i have neither
seen nor spoken to the ladi of my heart it is no reason why thou
shouldst sai thou hast not spoken to her or seen her when the contrari
is the case as thou well knowest
while the two were engag in thi convers thei perceiv someon
with a pair of mule approach the spot where thei stood and from
the nois the plough made as it drag along the ground thei guess
him to be some labour who had got up befor daybreak to go to hi
work and so it prove to be he came along sing the ballad that
sai
ill did ye fare ye men of franc
in roncesval chase
mai i die sancho said don quixot when he heard him if ani good
will come to us tonight dost thou not hear what that clown is
sing
i do said sancho but what ha roncesval chase to do with what
we have in hand he might just as well be sing the ballad of
calaino for ani good or ill that can come to us in our busi
by thi time the labour had come up and don quixot ask him can
you tell me worthi friend and god speed you whereabout here is the
palac of the peerless princess doa dulcinea del toboso

dai in the town do farm work for a rich farmer in that hous
opposit there live the curat of the villag and the sacristan and
both or either of them will be abl to give your worship some account
of thi ladi princess for thei have a list of all the peopl of el
toboso though it is my belief there is not a princess live in the
whole of it mani ladi there ar of qualiti and in her own hous
each of them mai be a princess

said don quixot
mai be so repli the lad god be with you for here come the

peopl find out that you were here with the intent of go to
tamper with their princess and troubl their ladi were to come and
cudgel your rib and not leav a whole bone in you thei would
inde have veri good reason if thei did not see that i am under

he could come to wa to sai to himself again well there remedi for
everyth except death under whose yoke we have all to pass whether
we like it or not when life finish i have seen by a thousand
sign that thi master of mine is a madman fit to be ti and for that
matter i too am not behind him for im a greater fool than he is
when i follow him and serv him if there ani truth in the proverb
that sai tell me what compani thou keepest and ill tell thee what
thou art or in that other not with whom thou art bred but with
whom thou art fed well then if he be mad as he is and with a
mad that mostli take on thing for anoth and white for black
and black for white as wa seen when he said the windmil were
giant and the monk mule dromedari flock of sheep armi of
enemi and much more to the same tune it will not be veri hard to
make him believ that some countri girl the first i come across here
is the ladi dulcinea and if he doe not believ it ill swear it and
if he should swear ill swear again and if he persist ill persist
still more so as come what mai to have my quoit alwai over the peg
mayb by hold out in thi wai i mai put a stop to hi send me
on messag of thi kind anoth time or mayb he will think as i
suspect he will that on of those wick enchant who he sai have

sancho stood asid and let her go veri well pleas to have got so
well out of the hobbl he wa in the instant the villag lass who had
done duti for dulcinea found herself free prod her cacknei with
a spike she had at the end of a stick she set off at full speed across
the field the sheass howev feel the point more acut than
usual began cut such caper that it flung the ladi dulcinea to
the ground see which don quixot ran to rais her up and sancho
to fix and girth the packsaddl which also had slip under the
asss belli the packsaddl be secur as don quixot wa about to
lift up hi enchant mistress in hi arm and put her upon her beast
the ladi get up from the ground save him the troubl for go
back a littl she took a short run and put both hand on the
croup of the ass she drop into the saddl more lightli than a
falcon and sat astrid like a man whereat sancho said rogu but
our ladi is lighter than a lanner and might teach the cleverest
cordovan or mexican how to mount she clear the back of the saddl in
on jump and without spur she is make the hacknei go like a zebra
and her damsel ar no wai behind her for thei all fly like the wind
which wa the truth for as soon as thei saw dulcinea mount thei
push on after her and sped awai without look back for more than
half a leagu
don quixot follow them with hi ey and when thei were no longer
in sight he turn to sancho and said how now sancho thou seest
how i am hate by enchant and see to what a length the malic and
spite thei bear me go when thei seek to depriv me of the happi it
would give me to see my ladi in her own proper form the fact is i wa
born to be an exampl of misfortun and the target and mark at which
the arrow of advers ar aim and direct observ too sancho
that these traitor were not content with chang and transform my
dulcinea but thei transform and chang her into a shape as mean and
illfavour as that of the villag girl yonder and at the same time
thei rob her of that which is such a peculiar properti of ladi of
distinct that is to sai the sweet fragranc that come of be
alwai among perfum and flower for i must tell thee sancho that
when i approach to put dulcinea upon her hacknei as thou sayest it
wa though to me it appear a sheass she gave me a whiff of raw
garlic that made my head reel and poison my veri heart
o scum of the earth cri sancho at thi o miser spite
enchant o that i could see you all strung by the gill like
sardin on a twig ye know a great deal ye can do a great deal and
ye do a great deal more it ought to have been enough for you ye
scoundrel to have chang the pearl of my ladi ey into oak
gall and her hair of purest gold into the bristl of a red ox
tail and in short all her featur from fair to foul without
meddl with her smell for by that we might somehow have found out
what wa hidden underneath that ugli rind though to tell the truth i
never perceiv her ugli but onli her beauti which wa rais to
the highest pitch of perfect by a mole she had on her right lip
like a moustach with seven or eight red hair like thread of gold
and more than a palm long
from the correspond which exist between those of the face and
those of the bodi said don quixot dulcinea must have anoth mole
resembl that on the thick of the thigh on that side on which she ha
the on on her face but hair of the length thou hast mention ar
veri long for mole
well all i can sai is there thei were as plain as could be repli
sancho
i believ it my friend return don quixot for natur bestow
noth on dulcinea that wa not perfect and wellfinish and so if
she had a hundr mole like the on thou hast describ in her thei
would not be mole but moon and shine star but tell me sancho
that which seem to me to be a packsaddl as thou wert fix it wa
it a flatsaddl or a sidesaddl
it wa neither repli sancho but a jineta saddl with a field
cover worth half a kingdom so rich is it
and that i could not see all thi sancho said don quixot onc
more i sai and will sai a thousand time i am the most unfortun of
men
sancho the rogu had enough to do to hide hi laughter at hear
the simplic of the master he had so nice befool at length
after a good deal more convers had pass between them thei
remount their beast and follow the road to saragossa which thei
expect to reach in time to take part in a certain grand festiv
which is held everi year in that illustri citi but befor thei got

deject beyond measur did don quixot pursu hi journei turn
over in hi mind the cruel trick the enchant had plai him in
chang hi ladi dulcinea into the vile shape of the villag lass nor
could he think of ani wai of restor her to her origin form and
these reflect so absorb him that without be awar of it he
let go rocinant bridl and he perceiv the liberti that wa
grant him stop at everi step to crop the fresh grass with which
the plain abound
sancho recal him from hi reveri melancholi seor said he
wa made not for beast but for men but if men give wai to it
overmuch thei turn to beast control yourself your worship be
yourself again gather up rocinant rein cheer up rous yourself
and show that gallant spirit that knightserr ought to have what
the devil is thi what weak is thi ar we here or in franc the
devil fly awai with all the dulcinea in the world for the wellb
of a singl knighterr is of more consequ than all the
enchant and transform on earth
hush sancho said don quixot in a weak and faint voic hush and
utter no blasphemi against that enchant ladi for i alon am to
blame for her misfortun and hard fate her calam ha come of the
hatr the wick bear me
so sai i return sancho hi heart rend in twain i trow who saw
her onc to see her now
thou mayest well sai that sancho repli don quixot as thou
sawest her in the full perfect of her beauti for the enchant
doe not go so far as to pervert thy vision or hide her loveli from
thee against me alon and against my ey is the strength of it venom
direct nevertheless there is on thing which ha occur to me
and that is that thou didst ill describ her beauti to me for as well
as i recollect thou saidst that her ey were pearl but ey that
ar like pearl ar rather the ey of a seabream than of a ladi and
i am persuad that dulcinea must be green emerald full and soft
with two rainbow for eyebrow take awai those pearl from her ey
and transfer them to her teeth for beyond a doubt sancho thou hast
taken the on for the other the ey for the teeth
veri like said sancho for her beauti bewild me as much as
her ugli did your worship but let us leav it all to god who
alon know what is to happen in thi vale of tear in thi evil world
of our where there is hardli a thing to be found without some mixtur
of wicked rogueri and rascal but on thing seor troubl
me more than all the rest and that is think what is to be done when
your worship conquer some giant or some other knight and order him
to go and present himself befor the beauti of the ladi dulcinea where
is thi poor giant or thi poor wretch of a vanquish knight to find
her i think i can see them wander all over el toboso look like
noddi and ask for my ladi dulcinea and even if thei meet her in
the middl of the street thei wont know her ani more than thei would
my father
perhap sancho return don quixot the enchant doe not go
so far as to depriv conquer and present giant and knight of the
power of recognis dulcinea we will try by experi with on or
two of the first i vanquish and send to her whether thei see her or
not by command them to return and give me an account of what
happen to them in thi respect
i declar i think what your worship ha propos is excel said
sancho and that by thi plan we shall find out what we want to know
and if it be that it is onli from your worship she is hidden the
misfortun will be more your than her but so long as the ladi
dulcinea is well and happi we on our part will make the best of it
and get on as well as we can seek our adventur and leav time
to take hi own cours for he is the best physician for these and
greater ailment
don quixot wa about to repli to sancho panza but he wa prevent by
a cart cross the road full of the most divers and strang
personag and figur that could be imagin he who led the mule and
act as carter wa a hideou demon the cart wa open to the sky
without a tilt or cane roof and the first figur that present itself
to don quixot ey wa that of death itself with a human face next
to it wa an angel with larg paint wing and at on side an
emperor with a crown to all appear of gold on hi head at the
feet of death wa the god call cupid without hi bandag but with
hi bow quiver and arrow there wa also a knight in full armour
except that he had no morion or helmet but onli a hat deck with
plume of diver colour and along with these there were other with a
varieti of costum and face all thi unexpectedli encount took
don quixot somewhat aback and struck terror into the heart of sancho
but the next instant don quixot wa glad of it believ that some
new peril adventur wa present itself to him and under thi
impress and with a spirit prepar to face ani danger he plant
himself in front of the cart and in a loud and menac tone
exclaim carter or coachman or devil or whatev thou art tell
me at onc who thou art whither thou art go and who these folk ar
thou carriest in thy wagon which look more like charon boat than an
ordinari cart
to which the devil stop the cart answer quietli seor we ar
player of angulo el malo compani we have been act the plai of
the cort of death thi morn which is the octav of corpu
christi in a villag behind that hill and we have to act it thi
afternoon in that villag which you can see from thi and as it is so
near and to save the troubl of undress and dress again we go
in the costum in which we perform that lad there appear as death
that other as an angel that woman the manag wife plai the
queen thi on the soldier that the emperor and i the devil and i
am on of the princip charact of the plai for in thi compani i
take the lead part if you want to know anyth more about us ask
me and i will answer with the utmost exactitud for as i am a devil i
am up to everyth
by the faith of a knighterr repli don quixot when i saw
thi cart i fanci some great adventur wa present itself to me
but i declar on must touch with the hand what appear to the ey if
illus ar to be avoid god speed you good peopl keep your
festiv and rememb if you demand of me ought wherein i can render
you a servic i will do it gladli and willingli for from a child i
wa fond of the plai and in my youth a keen lover of the actor art
while thei were talk fate so will it that on of the compani in a
mummer dress with a great number of bell and arm with three blown
oxbladd at the end of a stick join them and thi merryandrew
approach don quixot began flourish hi stick and bang the
ground with the bladder and cut caper with great jingl of the
bell which untoward apparit so startl rocinant that in spite
of don quixot effort to hold him in take the bit between hi
teeth he set off across the plain with greater speed than the bone of

sancho who thought hi master wa in danger of be thrown jump
off dappl and ran in all hast to help him but by the time he
reach him he wa alreadi on the ground and besid him wa rocinant
who had come down with hi master the usual end and upshot of
rocinant vivac and high spirit but the moment sancho quit
hi beast to go and help don quixot the danc devil with the
bladder jump up on dappl and beat him with them more by the
fright and the nois than by the pain of the blow made him fly across
the field toward the villag where thei were go to hold their
festiv sancho wit dappl career and hi master fall and
did not know which of the two case of need he should attend to first
but in the end like a good squir and good servant he let hi love
for hi master prevail over hi affect for hi ass though everi
time he saw the bladder rise in the air and come down on the hind
quarter of hi dappl he felt the pain and terror of death and he
would have rather had the blow fall on the appl of hi own ey than
on the least hair of hi asss tail in thi troubl and perplex he
came to where don quixot lai in a far sorrier plight than he like
and have help him to mount rocinant he said to him seor the
devil ha carri off my dappl
what devil ask don quixot
the on with the bladder said sancho
then i will recov him said don quixot even if he be shut up
with him in the deepest and darkest dungeon of hell follow me
sancho for the cart goe slowli and with the mule of it i will make
good the loss of dappl
you need not take the troubl seor said sancho keep cool for as
i now see the devil ha let dappl go and he is come back to hi old
quarter and so it turn out for have come down with dappl in
imit of don quixot and rocinant the devil made off on foot to
the town and the ass came back to hi master
for all that said don quixot it will be well to visit the
discourtesi of that devil upon some of those in the cart even if it
were the emperor himself
dont think of it your worship return sancho take my advic and
never meddl with actor for thei ar a favour class i myself have
known an actor taken up for two murder and yet come off scotfre
rememb that as thei ar merri folk who give pleasur everyon
favour and protect them and help and make much of them abov all
when thei ar those of the royal compani and under patent all or
most of whom in dress and appear look like princ
still for all that said don quixot the player devil must not go
off boast even if the whole human race favour him
so sai he made for the cart which wa now veri near the town
shout out as he went stai halt ye merri jovial crew i want to
teach you how to treat ass and anim that serv the squir of
knightserr for steed
so loud were the shout of don quixot that those in the cart heard
and understood them and guess by the word what the speaker
intent wa death in an instant jump out of the cart and the
emperor the devil carter and the angel after him nor did the queen or
the god cupid stai behind and all arm themselv with stone and
form in line prepar to receiv don quixot on the point of their
pebbl don quixot when he saw them drawn up in such a gallant arrai
with uplift arm readi for a mighti discharg of stone check
rocinant and began to consid in what wai he could attack them with
the least danger to himself as he halt sancho came up and see
him dispos to attack thi wellord squadron said to him it
would be the height of mad to attempt such an enterpris rememb
seor that against sop from the brook and plenti of them there is
no defens armour in the world except to stow oneself awai under a
brass bell and besid on should rememb that it is rash and
not valour for a singl man to attack an armi that ha death in it
and where emperor fight in person with angel good and bad to help
them and if thi reflect will not make you keep quiet perhap it
will to know for certain that among all these though thei look like
king princ and emperor there is not a singl knighterr
now inde thou hast hit the point sancho said don quixot which
mai and should turn me from the resolut i had alreadi form i
cannot and must not draw sword as i have mani a time befor told thee
against anyon who is not a dub knight it is for thee sancho if

and hi squir pass under some tall shadi tree and don quixot at
sancho persuas at a littl from the store carri by dappl and
over their supper sancho said to hi master seor what a fool i
should have look if i had chosen for my reward the spoil of the
first adventur your worship achiev instead of the foal of the
three mare after all a sparrow in the hand is better than a vultur
on the wing
at the same time sancho repli don quixot if thou hadst let me
attack them as i want at the veri least the emperor gold crown and
cupid paint wing would have fallen to thee as spoil for i should
have taken them by forc and given them into thy hand
the sceptr and crown of those playactor emperor said sancho
were never yet pure gold but onli brass foil or tin
that is true said don quixot for it would not be right that the
accessori of the drama should be real instead of be mere fiction
and semblanc like the drama itself toward which sanchoand as a
necessari consequ toward those who repres and produc iti
would that thou wert favour dispos for thei ar all instrument
of great good to the state place befor us at everi step a mirror in
which we mai see vividli displai what goe on in human life nor is
there ani similitud that show us more faithfulli what we ar and
ought to be than the plai and the player come tell me hast thou not
seen a plai act in which king emperor pontiff knight ladi
and diver other personag were introduc on plai the villain
anoth the knave thi on the merchant that the soldier on the
sharpwit fool anoth the foolish lover and when the plai is
over and thei have put off the dress thei wore in it all the actor
becom equal
ye i have seen that said sancho
well then said don quixot the same thing happen in the comedi
and life of thi world where some plai emperor other pope and in
short all the charact that can be brought into a plai but when it
is over that is to sai when life end death strip them all of the
garment that distinguish on from the other and all ar equal in the
grave
a fine comparison said sancho though not so new but that i have
heard it mani and mani a time as well as that other on of the game of
chess how so long as the game last each piec ha it own
particular offic and when the game is finish thei ar all mix
jumbl up and shaken togeth and stow awai in the bag which is
much like end life in the grave
thou art grow less doltish and more shrewd everi dai sancho said
don quixot
ay said sancho it must be that some of your worship shrewd
stick to me land that of itself is barren and dry will come to
yield good fruit if you dung it and till it what i mean is that your
worship convers ha been the dung that ha fallen on the barren
soil of my dry wit and the time i have been in your servic and
societi ha been the tillag and with the help of thi i hope to yield
fruit in abund that will not fall awai or slide from those path of
good breed that your worship ha made in my parch understand
don quixot laugh at sancho affect phraseolog and perceiv
that what he said about hi improv wa true for now and then he
spoke in a wai that surpris him though alwai or mostli when
sancho tri to talk fine and attempt polit languag he wound up by
toppl over from the summit of hi simplic into the abyss of hi
ignor and where he show hi cultur and hi memori to the

in convers of thi kind thei pass a good part of the night but
sancho felt a desir to let down the curtain of hi ey as he us
to sai when he want to go to sleep and strip dappl he left him
at liberti to graze hi fill he did not remov rocinant saddl as
hi master express order were that so long as thei were in the
field or not sleep under a roof rocinant wa not to be strippedth
ancient usag establish and observ by knightserr be to take
off the bridl and hang it on the saddlebow but to remov the saddl
from the horsenev sancho act accordingli and gave him the same
liberti he had given dappl between whom and rocinant there wa a
friendship so unequal and so strong that it is hand down by
tradit from father to son that the author of thi veraci histori
devot some special chapter to it which in order to preserv the
proprieti and decorum due to a histori so heroic he did not insert
therein although at time he forget thi resolut of hi and
describ how eagerli the two beast would scratch on anoth when
thei were togeth and how when thei were tire or full rocinant
would lai hi neck across dappl stretch half a yard or more on
the other side and the pair would stand thu gaze thoughtfulli on
the ground for three dai or at least so long as thei were left
alon or hunger did not drive them to go and look for food i mai add
that thei sai the author left it on record that he liken their
friendship to that of nisu and euryalu and pylad and orest and
if that be so it mai be perceiv to the admir of mankind how
firm the friendship must have been between these two peac anim
shame men who preserv friendship with on anoth so badli thi
wa why it wa said
for friend no longer is there friend
the reed turn lanc now
and someon els ha sung
friend to friend the bug etc
and let no on fanci that the author wa at all astrai when he compar
the friendship of these anim to that of men for men have receiv
mani lesson from beast and learn mani import thing as for
exampl the clyster from the stork vomit and gratitud from the dog
watch from the crane foresight from the ant modesti from the
eleph and loyalti from the hors
sancho at last fell asleep at the foot of a cork tree while don
quixot doze at that of a sturdi oak but a short time onli had
elaps when a nois he heard behind him awok him and rise up
startl he listen and look in the direct the nois came from
and perceiv two men on horseback on of whom let himself drop
from the saddl said to the other dismount my friend and take the
bridl off the hors for so far as i can see thi place will
furnish grass for them and the solitud and silenc my lovesick
thought need of as he said thi he stretch himself upon the
ground and as he flung himself down the armour in which he wa clad
rattl wherebi don quixot perceiv that he must be a knighterr
and go over to sancho who wa asleep he shook him by the arm and
with no small difficulti brought him back to hi sens and said in a
low voic to him brother sancho we have got an adventur
god send us a good on said sancho and where mai her ladyship the
adventur be
where sancho repli don quixot turn thine ey and look and
thou wilt see stretch there a knighterr who it strike me is
not over and abov happi for i saw him fling himself off hi hors and
throw himself on the ground with a certain air of deject and hi
armour rattl as he fell
well said sancho how doe your worship make out that to be an
adventur
i do not mean to sai return don quixot that it is a complet
adventur but that it is the begin of on for it is in thi wai
adventur begin but listen for it seem he is tune a lute or
guitar and from the wai he is spit and clear hi chest he must
be get readi to sing someth
faith you ar right said sancho and no doubt he is some enamour
knight
there is no knighterr that is not said don quixot but let us
listen to him for if he sing by that thread we shall extract the
ball of hi thought becaus out of the abund of the heart the
mouth speaketh
sancho wa about to repli to hi master but the knight of the grove
voic which wa neither veri bad nor veri good stop him and
listen attent the pair heard him sing thi
sonnet
your pleasur prithe ladi mine unfold
declar the term that i am to obei
my will to your submiss i mould
and from your law my feet shall never strai
would you i die to silent grief a prei
then count me even now as dead and cold
would you i tell my woe in some new wai
then shall my tale by love itself be told
the unison of opposit to prove
of the soft wax and diamond hard am i
but still obedi to the law of love
here hard or soft i offer you my breast
whateer you grave or stamp thereon shall rest
indel for all etern
with an ah me that seem to be drawn from the inmost recess of
hi heart the knight of the grove brought hi lai to an end and
shortli afterward exclaim in a melancholi and piteou voic o
fairest and most ungrat woman on earth what can it be most
seren casildea de vandalia that thou wilt suffer thi thy captiv
knight to wast awai and perish in ceaseless wander and rude and
arduou toil it is not enough that i have compel all the knight
of navarr all the leones all the tartesian all the castilian
and final all the knight of la mancha to confess thee the most
beauti in the world
not so said don quixot at thi for i am of la mancha and i have
never confess anyth of the sort nor could i nor should i confess
a thing so much to the prejudic of my ladi beauti thou seest how
thi knight is rave sancho but let us listen perhap he will tell
us more about himself
that he will return sancho for he seem in a mood to bewail
himself for a month at a stretch
but thi wa not the case for the knight of the grove hear voic
near him instead of continu hi lament stood up and exclaim
in a distinct but courteou tone who goe there what ar you do you
belong to the number of the happi or of the miser
of the miser answer don quixot
then come to me said he of the grove and rest assur that it is
to woe itself and afflict itself you come
don quixot find himself answer in such a soft and courteou
manner went over to him and so did sancho
the dole knight took don quixot by the arm sai sit down here
sir knight for that you ar on and of those that profess
knighterrantri it is to me a suffici proof to have found you in
thi place where solitud and night the natur couch and proper
retreat of knightserr keep you compani to which don made answer
a knight i am of the profess you mention and though sorrow
misfortun and calam have made my heart their abod the
compass i feel for the misfortun of other ha not been therebi
banish from it from what you have just now sung i gather that your
spring from love i mean from the love you bear that fair ingrat you
name in your lament
in the meantim thei had seat themselv togeth on the hard ground
peaceabl and sociabl just as if as soon as dai broke thei were not
go to break on anoth head
ar you sir knight in love perchanc ask he of the grove of don
quixot
by mischanc i am repli don quixot though the ill aris from
wellbestow affect should be esteem favour rather than
misfortun
that is true return he of the grove if scorn did not unsettl
our reason and understand for if it be excess it look like
reveng
i wa never scorn by my ladi said don quixot
certainli not said sancho who stood close by for my ladi is as a
lamb and softer than a roll of butter
is thi your squir ask he of the grove
he is said don quixot
i never yet saw a squir said he of the grove who ventur to
speak when hi master wa speak at least there is mine who is as
big as hi father and it cannot be prove that he ha ever open hi
lip when i am speak
by my faith then said sancho i have spoken and am fit to speak
in the presenc of on as much or evenbut never mindit onli make it
wors to stir it
the squir of the grove took sancho by the arm sai to him let us
two go where we can talk in squir style as much as we pleas and
leav these gentlemen our master to fight it out over the stori of
their love and depend upon it daybreak will find them at it without
have made an end of it
so be it by all mean said sancho and i will tell your worship who
i am that you mai see whether i am to be reckon among the number of
the most talk squir

the knight and the squir made two parti these tell the stori
of their live the other the stori of their love but the histori
relat first of all the convers of the servant and afterward
take up that of the master and it sai that withdraw a littl
from the other he of the grove said to sancho a hard life it is we
lead and live seor we that ar squir to knightserr verili we
eat our bread in the sweat of our face which is on of the curs god
laid on our first parent
it mai be said too ad sancho that we eat it in the chill of
our bodi for who get more heat and cold than the miser squir
of knighterrantri even so it would not be so bad if we had someth
to eat for woe ar lighter if there bread but sometim we go a
dai or two without break our fast except with the wind that blow
all that said he of the grove mai be endur and put up with when
we have hope of reward for unless the knighterr he serv is
excess unlucki after a few turn the squir will at least find
himself reward with a fine govern of some island or some fair
counti
i said sancho have alreadi told my master that i shall be content
with the govern of some island and he is so nobl and gener
that he ha promis it to me ever so mani time
i said he of the grove shall be satisfi with a canonri for my
servic and my master ha alreadi assign me on
your master said sancho no doubt is a knight in the church line
and can bestow reward of that sort on hi good squir but mine is
onli a layman though i rememb some clever but to my mind
design peopl strove to persuad him to try and becom an
archbishop he howev would not be anyth but an emperor but i
wa trembl all the time lest he should take a fanci to go into the
church not find myself fit to hold offic in it for i mai tell
you though i seem a man i am no better than a beast for the church
well then you ar wrong there said he of the grove for those
island govern ar not all satisfactori some ar awkward some ar
poor some ar dull and in short the highest and choicest bring
with it a heavi burden of care and troubl which the unhappi wight to
whose lot it ha fallen bear upon hi shoulder far better would it
be for us who have adopt thi accurs servic to go back to our own
hous and there emploi ourselv in pleasant occupationsin hunt
or fish for instanc for what squir in the world is there so poor
as not to have a hack and a coupl of greyhound and a fishingrod to
amus himself with in hi own villag
i am not in want of ani of those thing said sancho to be sure i
have no hack but i have an ass that is worth my master hors twice
over god send me a bad easter and that the next on i am to see if i
would swap even if i got four bushel of barlei to boot you will
laugh at the valu i put on my dapplefor dappl is the colour of my
beast as to greyhound i cant want for them for there ar enough
and to spare in my town and moreov there is more pleasur in sport
when it is at other peopl expens
in truth and earnest sir squir said he of the grove i have made
up my mind and determin to have done with these drunken vagari of
these knight and go back to my villag and bring up my children for
i have three like three orient pearl
i have two said sancho that might be present befor the pope
himself especi a girl whom i am breed up for a countess pleas
god though in spite of her mother
and how old is thi ladi that is be bred up for a countess ask
he of the grove
fifteen a coupl of year more or less answer sancho but she is
as tall as a lanc and as fresh as an april morn and as strong as
a porter
those ar gift to fit her to be not onli a countess but a nymph of
the greenwood said he of the grove whoreson strumpet what pith the
rogu must have
to which sancho made answer somewhat sulkili she no strumpet nor
wa her mother nor will either of them be pleas god while i live
speak more civilli for on bred up among knightserr who ar
courtesi itself your word dont seem to me to be veri becom
o how littl you know about compliment sir squir return he of
the grove what dont you know that when a horseman deliv a good
lanc thrust at the bull in the plaza or when anyon doe anyth
veri well the peopl ar wont to sai ha whoreson rip how well he
ha done it and that what seem to be abus in the express is high
prais disown son and daughter seor who dont do what deserv
that compliment of thi sort should be paid to their parent
i do disown them repli sancho and in thi wai and by the same
reason you might call me and my children and my wife all the
strumpet in the world for all thei do and sai is of a kind that in
the highest degre deserv the same prais and to see them again i
prai god to deliv me from mortal sin or what come to the same
thing to deliv me from thi peril call of squir into which i
have fallen a second time decai and beguil by a purs with a
hundr ducat that i found on dai in the heart of the sierra morena
and the devil is alwai put a bag full of doubloon befor my ey
here there everywher until i fanci at everi stop i am put my
hand on it and hug it and carri it home with me and make
invest and get interest and live like a princ and so
long as i think of thi i make light of all the hardship i endur with
thi simpleton of a master of mine who i well know is more of a
madman than a knight
there why thei sai that covet burst the bag said he of
the grove but if you come to talk of that sort there is not a
greater on in the world than my master for he is on of those of whom
thei sai the care of other kill the ass for in order that
anoth knight mai recov the sens he ha lost he make a madman of
himself and goe look for what when found mai for all i know fly
in hi own face and is he in love perchanc ask sancho
he is said of the grove with on casildea de vandalia the rawest
and best roast ladi the whole world could produc but that raw
is not the onli foot he limp on for he ha greater scheme rumbl
in hi bowel as will be seen befor mani hour ar over
there no road so smooth but it ha some hole or hindranc in it
said sancho in other hous thei cook bean but in mine it by the
pot mad will have more follow and hangerson than sound
sens but if there be ani truth in the common sai that to have
companion in troubl give some relief i mai take consol from
you inasmuch as you serv a master as crazi as my own
crazi but valiant repli he of the grove and more roguish than
crazi or valiant
mine is not that said sancho i mean he ha noth of the rogu in
him on the contrari he ha the soul of a pitcher he ha no thought
of do harm to anyon onli good to all nor ha he ani malic
whatev in him a child might persuad him that it is night at
noondai and for thi simplic i love him as the core of my heart
and i cant bring myself to leav him let him do ever such foolish
thing
for all that brother and seor said he of the grove if the blind
lead the blind both ar in danger of fall into the pit it is
better for us to beat a quiet retreat and get back to our own quarter
for those who seek adventur dont alwai find good on
sancho kept spit from time to time and hi spittl seem somewhat
ropi and dry observ which the compassion squir of the grove
said it seem to me that with all thi talk of our our tongu ar
stick to the roof of our mouth but i have a pretti good loosen
hang from the saddlebow of my hors and get up he came back
the next minut with a larg bota of wine and a pasti half a yard
across and thi is no exagger for it wa made of a hous rabbit
so big that sancho as he handl it took it to be made of a goat not
to sai a kid and look at it he said and do you carri thi with
you seor
why what ar you think about said the other do you take me for
some paltri squir i carri a better larder on my hors croup than a
gener take with him when he goe on a march
sancho at without requir to be press and in the dark bolt
mouth like the knot on a tether and said he you ar a proper
trusti squir on of the right sort sumptuou and grand as thi
banquet show which if it ha not come here by magic art at ani rate
ha the look of it not like me unlucki beggar that have noth more
in my alforja than a scrap of chees so hard that on might brain a
giant with it and to keep it compani a few dozen carob and as mani
more filbert and walnut thank to the auster of my master and
the idea he ha and the rule he follow that knightserr must not
live or sustain themselv on anyth except dri fruit and the
herb of the field
by my faith brother said he of the grove my stomach is not made
for thistl or wild pear or root of the wood let our master do
as thei like with their chivalri notion and law and eat what those
enjoin i carri my progbasket and thi bota hang to the saddlebow
whatev thei mai sai and it is such an object of worship with me and
i love it so that there is hardli a moment but i am kiss and
embrac it over and over again and so sai he thrust it into
sancho hand who rais it aloft point to hi mouth gaze at the
star for a quarter of an hour and when he had done drink let hi
head fall on on side and give a deep sigh exclaim ah whoreson
rogu how cathol it is
there you see said he of the grove hear sancho exclam
how you have call thi wine whoreson by wai of prais
well said sancho i own it and i grant it is no dishonour to call
anyon whoreson when it is to be understood as prais but tell me
seor by what you love best is thi ciudad real wine
o rare winetast said he of the grove nowher els inde doe
it come from and it ha some year ag too
leav me alon for that said sancho never fear but ill hit upon
the place it came from somehow what would you sai sir squir to my
have such a great natur instinct in judg wine that you have
onli to let me smell on and i can tell posit it countri it
kind it flavour and sound the chang it will undergo and
everyth that appertain to a wine but it is no wonder for i have
had in my famili on my father side the two best winetast that
have been known in la mancha for mani a long year and to prove it ill
tell you now a thing that happen them thei gave the two of them some
wine out of a cask to try ask their opinion as to the condit
qualiti good or bad of the wine on of them tri it with the
tip of hi tongu the other did no more than bring it to hi nose the
first said the wine had a flavour of iron the second said it had a
stronger flavour of cordovan the owner said the cask wa clean and
that noth had been ad to the wine from which it could have got a
flavour of either iron or leather nevertheless these two great
winetast held to what thei had said time went by the wine wa
sold and when thei came to clean out the cask thei found in it a
small kei hang to a thong of cordovan see now if on who come of
the same stock ha not a right to give hi opinion in such like case
therefor i sai said he of the grove let us give up go in
quest of adventur and as we have loav let us not go look for
cake but return to our crib for god will find us there if it be hi
will
until my master reach saragossa said sancho ill remain in hi
servic after that well see
the end of it wa that the two squir talk so much and drank so much
that sleep had to tie their tongu and moder their thirst for to
quench it wa imposs and so the pair of them fell asleep cling
to the now nearli empti bota and with halfchew morsel in their
mouth and there we will leav them for the present to relat what
pass between the knight of the grove and him of the rueful
counten

among the thing that pass between don quixot and the knight of the
wood the histori tell us he of the grove said to don quixot in
fine sir knight i would have you know that my destini or more
properli speak my choic led me to fall in love with the peerless
casildea de vandalia i call her peerless becaus she ha no peer
whether it be in bodili statur or in the supremaci of rank and beauti
thi same casildea then that i speak of requit my honour
passion and gentl aspir by compel me as hi stepmoth did
hercul to engag in mani peril of variou sort at the end of each
promis me that with the end of the next the object of my hope
should be attain but my labour have gone on increas link by link
until thei ar past count nor do i know what will be the last on
that is to be the begin of the accomplish of my chast desir
on on occas she bade me go and challeng the famou giantess of
sevil la giralda by name who is as mighti and strong as if made of
brass and though never stir from on spot is the most restless
and changeabl woman in the world i came i saw i conquer and i
made her stai quiet and behav herself for noth but north wind
blew for more than a week anoth time i wa order to lift those
ancient stone the mighti bull of guisando an enterpris that might
more fitli be entrust to porter than to knight again she bade me
fling myself into the cavern of cabraan unparallel and aw
periland bring her a minut account of all that is conceal in those
gloomi depth i stop the motion of the giralda i lift the bull
of guisando i flung myself into the cavern and brought to light the
secret of it abyss and my hope ar as dead as dead can be and her
scorn and her command as live as ever to be brief last of all she
ha command me to go through all the provinc of spain and compel
all the knightserr wander therein to confess that she surpass
all women aliv todai in beauti and that i am the most valiant and
the most deepli enamour knight on earth in support of which claim i
have alreadi travel over the greater part of spain and have there
vanquish sever knight who have dare to contradict me but what i
most plume and pride myself upon is have vanquish in singl combat
that so famou knight don quixot of la mancha and made him confess
that my casildea is more beauti than hi dulcinea and in thi on
victori i hold myself to have conquer all the knight in the world
for thi don quixot that i speak of ha vanquish them all and i
have vanquish him hi glori hi fame and hi honour have pass
and ar transfer to my person for
the more the vanquish hath of fair renown
the greater glori gild the victor crown
thu the innumer achiev of the said don quixot ar now set
down to my account and have becom mine
don quixot wa amaz when he heard the knight of the grove and wa a
thousand time on the point of tell him he li and had the lie
direct alreadi on the tip of hi tongu but he restrain himself as
well as he could in order to forc him to confess the lie with hi own
lip so he said to him quietli as to what you sai sir knight about
have vanquish most of the knight of spain or even of the whole
world i sai noth but that you have vanquish don quixot of la
mancha i consid doubt it mai have been some other that resembl
him although there ar few like him
how not vanquish said he of the grove by the heaven that is
abov us i fought don quixot and overcam him and made him yield and
he is a man of tall statur gaunt featur long lank limb with
hair turn grei an aquilin nose rather hook and larg black
droop moustach he doe battl under the name of the
counten and he ha for squir a peasant call sancho panza he
press the loin and rule the rein of a famou steed call
rocinant and lastli he ha for the mistress of hi will a certain
dulcinea del toboso onc upon a time call aldonza lorenzo just as i
call mine casildea de vandalia becaus her name is casilda and she is
of andalusia if all these token ar not enough to vindic the truth
of what i sai here is my sword that will compel incredul itself to
give credenc to it
calm yourself sir knight said don quixot and give ear to what i
am about to sai to you i would have you know that thi don quixot you
speak of is the greatest friend i have in the world so much so that i
mai sai i regard him in the same light as my own person and from the
precis and clear indic you have given i cannot but think that he
must be the veri on you have vanquish on the other hand i see with
my ey and feel with my hand that it is imposs it can have been
the same unless inde it be that as he ha mani enemi who ar
enchant and on in particular who is alwai persecut him
someon of these mai have taken hi shape in order to allow himself to
be vanquish so as to defraud him of the fame that hi exalt
achiev as a knight have earn and acquir for him throughout
the known world and in confirm of thi i must tell you too
that it is but ten hour sinc these said enchant hi enemi
transform the shape and person of the fair dulcinea del toboso into a
foul and mean villag lass and in the same wai thei must have
transform don quixot and if all thi doe not suffic to convinc
you of the truth of what i sai here is don quixot himself who will
maintain it by arm on foot or on horseback or in ani wai you pleas
and so sai he stood up and laid hi hand on hi sword wait to
see what the knight of the grove would do who in an equal calm voic
said in repli pledg dont distress a good payer he who ha
succeed in vanquish you onc when transform sir don quixot
mai fairli hope to subdu you in your own proper shape but as it is
not becom for knight to perform their feat of arm in the dark
like highwaymen and bulli let us wait till daylight that the sun
mai behold our deed and the condit of our combat shall be that
the vanquish shall be at the victor dispos to do all that he mai
enjoin provid the injunct be such as shall be becom a knight
i am more than satisfi with these condit and term repli don
quixot and so sai thei betook themselv to where their squir
lai and found them snore and in the same postur thei were in when
sleep fell upon them thei rous them up and bade them get the hors
readi as at sunris thei were to engag in a bloodi and arduou singl
combat at which intellig sancho wa aghast and thunderstruck
trembl for the safeti of hi master becaus of the mighti deed he
had heard the squir of the grove ascrib to hi but without a word
the two squir went in quest of their cattl for by thi time the
three hors and the ass had smelt on anoth out and were all
togeth
on the wai he of the grove said to sancho you must know brother
that it is the custom with the fight men of andalusia when thei ar
godfath in ani quarrel not to stand idl with fold arm while
their godson fight i sai so to remind you that while our master ar
fight we too have to fight and knock on anoth to shiver
that custom sir squir repli sancho mai hold good among those
bulli and fight men you talk of but certainli not among the
squir of knightserr at least i have never heard my master speak
of ani custom of the sort and he know all the law of knighterrantri
by heart but grant it true that there is an express law that
squir ar to fight while their master ar fight i dont mean to
obei it but to pai the penalti that mai be laid on peacefulli mind
squir like myself for i am sure it cannot be more than two pound of
wax and i would rather pai that for i know it will cost me less than
the lint i shall be at the expens of to mend my head which i look
upon as broken and split alreadi there anoth thing that make it
imposs for me to fight that i have no sword for i never carri
on in my life
i know a good remedi for that said he of the grove i have here two
linen bag of the same size you shall take on and i the other and
we will fight at bag blow with equal arm
if that the wai so be it with all my heart said sancho for that
sort of battl will serv to knock the dust out of us instead of
hurt us
that will not do said the other for we must put into the bag to
keep the wind from blow them awai half a dozen nice smooth pebbl
all of the same weight and in thi wai we shall be abl to bast on
anoth without do ourselv ani harm or mischief
bodi of my father said sancho see what marten and sabl and pad
of card cotton he is put into the bag that our head mai not be
broken and our bone beaten to jelli but even if thei ar fill with
toss silk i can tell you seor i am not go to fight let our
master fight that their lookout and let us drink and live for
time will take care to eas us of our live without our go to look
for fillip so that thei mai be finish off befor their proper time
come and thei drop from ripe
still return he of the grove we must fight if it be onli for
half an hour
by no mean said sancho i am not go to be so discourt or so
ungrat as to have ani quarrel be it ever so small with on i have
eaten and drunk with besid who the devil could bring himself to
fight in cold blood without anger or provoc
i can remedi that entir said he of the grove and in thi wai
befor we begin the battl i will come up to your worship fair and
softli and give you three or four buffet with which i shall stretch
you at my feet and rous your anger though it were sleep sounder
than a dormous
to match that plan said sancho i have anoth that is not a whit
behind it i will take a cudgel and befor your worship come near
enough to waken my anger i will send your so sound to sleep with
whack that it wont waken unless it be in the other world where it
is known that i am not a man to let my face be handl by anyon let
each look out for the arrowthough the surer wai would be to let
everyon anger sleep for nobodi know the heart of anyon and a man
mai come for wool and go back shorn god gave hi bless to peac and
hi curs to quarrel if a hunt cat surround and hard press
turn into a lion god know what i who am a man mai turn into and
so from thi time forth i warn you sir squir that all the harm and
mischief that mai come of our quarrel will be put down to your
account
veri good said he of the grove god will send the dawn and we shall
be all right
and now gayplumag bird of all sort began to warbl in the tree
and with their vari and gladsom note seem to welcom and salut
the fresh morn that wa begin to show the beauti of her counten
at the gate and balconi of the east shake from her lock a
profus of liquid pearl in which dulcet moistur bath the
plant too seem to shed and shower down a pearli sprai the willow
distil sweet manna the fountain laugh the brook babbl the
wood rejoic and the meadow arrai themselv in all their glori
at her come but hardli had the light of dai made it possibl to see
and distinguish thing when the first object that present itself to
the ey of sancho panza wa the squir of the grove nose which wa
so big that it almost overshadow hi whole bodi it is in fact
state that it wa of enorm size hook in the middl cover
with wart and of a mulberri colour like an eggplant it hung down
two finger length below hi mouth and the size the colour the
wart and the bend of it made hi face so hideou that sancho as he
look at him began to trembl hand and foot like a child in
convuls and he vow in hi heart to let himself be given two
hundr buffet sooner than be provok to fight that monster don
quixot examin hi adversari and found that he alreadi had hi
helmet on and visor lower so that he could not see hi face he
observ howev that he wa a sturdili built man but not veri tall
in statur over hi armour he wore a surcoat or cassock of what seem
to be the finest cloth of gold all bespangl with glitter mirror
like littl moon which gave him an extrem gallant and splendid
appear abov hi helmet flutter a great quantiti of plume
green yellow and white and hi lanc which wa lean against a
tree wa veri long and stout and had a steel point more than a palm
in length
don quixot observ all and took note of all and from what he saw
and observ he conclud that the said knight must be a man of great
strength but he did not for all that give wai to fear like sancho
panza on the contrari with a compos and dauntless air he said to
the knight of the mirror if sir knight your great eager to
fight ha not banish your courtesi by it i would entreat you to
rais your visor a littl in order that i mai see if the comeli of
your counten correspond with that of your equip
whether you come victori or vanquish out of thi empris sir
knight repli he of the mirror you will have more than enough
time and leisur to see me and if now i do not compli with your
request it is becaus it seem to me i should do a seriou wrong to
the fair casildea de vandalia in wast time while i stop to rais
my visor befor compel you to confess what you ar alreadi awar i
maintain
well then said don quixot while we ar mount you can at least
tell me if i am that don quixot whom you said you vanquish
to that we answer you said he of the mirror that you ar as like
the veri knight i vanquish as on egg is like anoth but as you sai
enchant persecut you i will not ventur to sai posit whether
you ar the said person or not
that said don quixot is enough to convinc me that you ar under
a decept howev entir to reliev you of it let our hors be
brought and in less time than it would take you to rais your visor
if god my ladi and my arm stand me in good stead i shall see your
face and you shall see that i am not the vanquish don quixot you
take me to be
with thi cut short the colloqui thei mount and don quixot
wheel rocinant round in order to take a proper distanc to charg
back upon hi adversari and he of the mirror did the same but don
quixot had not move awai twenti pace when he heard himself call by
the other and each return halfwai he of the mirror said to him
rememb sir knight that the term of our combat ar that the
vanquish as i said befor shall be at the victor dispos
i am awar of it alreadi said don quixot provid what is
command and impos upon the vanquish be thing that do not
transgress the limit of chivalri
that is understood repli he of the mirror
at thi moment the extraordinari nose of the squir present itself to
don quixot view and he wa no less amaz than sancho at the sight
insomuch that he set him down as a monster of some kind or a human
be of some new speci or unearthli breed sancho see hi master
retir to run hi cours did not like to be left alon with the nosi
man fear that with on flap of that nose on hi own the battl
would be all over for him and he would be left stretch on the ground
either by the blow or with fright so he ran after hi master hold
on to rocinant stirrupleath and when it seem to him time to
turn about he said i implor of your worship seor befor you turn
to charg to help me up into thi cork tree from which i will be abl
to wit the gallant encount your worship is go to have with
thi knight more to my tast and better than from the ground
it seem to me rather sancho said don quixot that thou wouldst
mount a scaffold in order to see the bull without danger
to tell the truth return sancho the monstrou nose of that
squir ha fill me with fear and terror and i dare not stai near
him
it is said don quixot such a on that were i not what i am it
would terrifi me too so come i will help thee up where thou wilt
while don quixot wait for sancho to mount into the cork tree he of
the mirror took as much ground as he consid requisit and
suppos don quixot to have done the same without wait for ani
sound of trumpet or other signal to direct them he wheel hi hors
which wa not more agil or betterlook than rocinant and at hi
top speed which wa an easi trot he proceed to charg hi enemi
see him howev engag in put sancho up he drew rein and
halt in mid career for which hi hors wa veri grate as he wa
alreadi unabl to go don quixot fanci that hi foe wa come
down upon him fly drove hi spur vigor into rocinant lean
flank and made him scud along in such style that the histori tell us
that on thi occas onli wa he known to make someth like run
for on all other it wa a simpl trot with him and with thi
unparallel furi he bore down where he of the mirror stood dig
hi spur into hi hors up to button without be abl to make him
stir a finger length from the spot where he had come to a standstil
in hi cours at thi lucki moment and crisi don quixot came upon
hi adversari in troubl with hi hors and embarrass with hi
lanc which he either could not manag or had no time to lai in rest
don quixot howev paid no attent to these difficulti and in
perfect safeti to himself and without ani risk encount him of the
mirror with such forc that he brought him to the ground in spite of
himself over the haunch of hi hors and with so heavi a fall that
he lai to all appear dead not stir hand or foot the instant
sancho saw him fall he slid down from the cork tree and made all hast
to where hi master wa who dismount from rocinant went and
stood over him of the mirror and unlac hi helmet to see if he wa
dead and to give him air if he should happen to be aliv he sawwho
can sai what he saw without fill all who hear it with astonish
wonder and aw he saw the histori sai the veri counten the
veri face the veri look the veri physiognomi the veri effigi the
veri imag of the bachelor samson carrasco as soon as he saw it he
call out in a loud voic make hast here sancho and behold what
thou art to see but not to believ quick my son and learn what magic
can do and wizard and enchant ar capabl of
sancho came up and when he saw the counten of the bachelor
carrasco he fell to cross himself a thousand time and bless
himself as mani more all thi time the prostrat knight show no
sign of life and sancho said to don quixot it is my opinion
seor that in ani case your worship should take and thrust your sword
into the mouth of thi on here that look like the bachelor samson
carrasco perhap in him you will kill on of your enemi the
enchant
thy advic is not bad said don quixot for of enemi the fewer
the better and he wa draw hi sword to carri into effect sancho
counsel and suggest when the squir of the mirror came up now
without the nose which had made him so hideou and cri out in a loud
voic mind what you ar about seor don quixot that is your
friend the bachelor samson carrasco you have at your feet and i am
hi squir
and the nose said sancho see him without the hideou featur he
had befor to which he repli i have it here in my pocket and
put hi hand into hi right pocket he pull out a masquerad nose
of varnish pasteboard of the make alreadi describ and sancho
examin him more and more close exclaim aloud in a voic of
amaz holi mari be good to me isnt it tom cecial my neighbour
and gossip
why to be sure i am return the now unnos squir tom cecial i
am gossip and friend sancho panza and ill tell you present the
mean and trick and falsehood by which i have been brought here but
in the meantim beg and entreat of your master not to touch maltreat
wound or slai the knight of the mirror whom he ha at hi feet
becaus beyond all disput it is the rash and illadvis bachelor
samson carrasco our fellow townsman
at thi moment he of the mirror came to himself and don quixot
perceiv it held the nake point of hi sword over hi face and
said to him you ar a dead man knight unless you confess that the
peerless dulcinea del toboso excel your casildea de vandalia in
beauti and in addit to thi you must promis if you should surviv
thi encount and fall to go to the citi of el toboso and present
yourself befor her on my behalf that she deal with you accord to
her good pleasur and if she leav you free to do your you ar in
like manner to return and seek me out for the trail of my mighti deed
will serv you as a guid to lead you to where i mai be and tell me
what mai have pass between you and hercondit which in
accord with what we stipul befor our combat do not transgress
the just limit of knighterrantri
i confess said the fallen knight that the dirti tatter shoe of
the ladi dulcinea del toboso is better than the illcomb though clean
beard of casildea and i promis to go and to return from her presenc
to your and to give you a full and particular account of all you
demand of me
you must also confess and believ ad don quixot that the
knight you vanquish wa not and could not be don quixot of la
mancha but someon els in hi like just as i confess and believ
that you though you seem to be the bachelor samson carrasco ar not
so but some other resembl him whom my enemi have here put befor
me in hi shape in order that i mai restrain and moder the
vehem of my wrath and make a gentl us of the glori of my
victori
i confess hold and think everyth to be as you believ hold and
think it the crippl knight let me rise i entreat you if
inde the shock of my fall will allow me for it ha left me in a
sorri plight enough
don quixot help him to rise with the assist of hi squir tom
cecial from whom sancho never took hi ey and to whom he put
question the repli to which furnish clear proof that he wa
realli and truli the tom cecial he said but the impress made on
sancho mind by what hi master said about the enchant have
chang the face of the knight of the mirror into that of the bachelor
samson carrasco would not permit him to believ what he saw with hi
ey in fine both master and man remain under the delus and
down in the mouth and out of luck he of the mirror and hi squir
part from don quixot and sancho he mean to go look for some
villag where he could plaster and strap hi rib don quixot and
sancho resum their journei to saragossa and on it the histori leav

don quixot went off satisfi elat and vainglori in the
highest degre at have won a victori over such a valiant knight as he
fanci him of the mirror to be and on from whose knightli word he
expect to learn whether the enchant of hi ladi still continu
inasmuch as the said vanquish knight wa bound under the penalti of
ceas to be on to return and render him an account of what took
place between him and her but don quixot wa of on mind he of the
mirror of anoth for he just then had no thought of anyth but
find some villag where he could plaster himself as ha been said
alreadi the histori goe on to sai then that when the bachelor
samson carrasco recommend don quixot to resum hi knighterrantri
which he had laid asid it wa in consequ of have been
previous in conclav with the curat and the barber on the mean to
be adopt to induc don quixot to stai at home in peac and quiet
without worri himself with hi illstar adventur at which
consult it wa decid by the unanim vote of all and on the
special advic of carrasco that don quixot should be allow to go
as it seem imposs to restrain him and that samson should salli
forth to meet him as a knighterr and do battl with him for there
would be no difficulti about a caus and vanquish him that be
look upon as an easi matter and that it should be agre and settl
that the vanquish wa to be at the merci of the victor then don
quixot be vanquish the bachelor knight wa to command him to
return to hi villag and hi hous and not quit it for two year or
until he receiv further order from him all which it wa clear don
quixot would unhesitatingli obei rather than contraven or fail to
observ the law of chivalri and dure the period of hi seclus he
might perhap forget hi folli or there might be an opportun of
discov some readi remedi for hi mad carrasco undertook the
task and tom cecial a gossip and neighbour of sancho panza a
live featherhead fellow offer himself as hi squir carrasco
arm himself in the fashion describ and tom cecial that he might
not be known by hi gossip when thei met fit on over hi own
natur nose the fals masquerad on that ha been mention and so
thei follow the same rout don quixot took and almost came up with
him in time to be present at the adventur of the cart of death and
final encount them in the grove where all that the sagaci
reader ha been read about took place and had it not been for the
extraordinari fanci of don quixot and hi convict that the
bachelor wa not the bachelor seor bachelor would have been
incapacit for ever from take hi degre of licenti all
through not find nest where he thought to find bird
tom cecial see how ill thei had succeed and what a sorri end
their expedit had come to said to the bachelor sure enough seor
samson carrasco we ar serv right it is easi enough to plan and set
about an enterpris but it is often a difficult matter to come well
out of it don quixot a madman and we sane he goe off laugh
safe and sound and you ar left sore and sorri id like to know now
which is the madder he who is so becaus he cannot help it or he who
is so of hi own choic
to which samson repli the differ between the two sort of
madmen is that he who is so will he nil he will be on alwai while
he who is so of hi own accord can leav off be on whenev he
like
in that case said tom cecial i wa a madman of my own accord when
i volunt to becom your squir and of my own accord ill leav
off be on and go home
that your affair return samson but to suppos that i am go
home until i have given don quixot a thrash is absurd and it is
not ani wish that he mai recov hi sens that will make me hunt him
out now but a wish for the sore pain i am in with my rib wont let me
entertain more charit thought
thu discours the pair proceed until thei reach a town where it
wa their good luck to find a bonesett with whose help the
unfortun samson wa cure tom cecial left him and went home while

don quixot pursu hi journei in the high spirit satisfact and
selfcomplac alreadi describ fanci himself the most valor
knighterr of the ag in the world becaus of hi late victori all
the adventur that could befal him from that time forth he regard
as alreadi done and brought to a happi issu he made light of
enchant and enchant he thought no more of the countless
drub that had been administ to him in the cours of hi
knighterrantri nor of the vollei of stone that had level half hi
teeth nor of the ingratitud of the gallei slave nor of the audac
of the yanguesan and the shower of stake that fell upon him in
short he said to himself that could he discov ani mean mode or
wai of disench hi ladi dulcinea he would not envi the highest
fortun that the most fortun knighterr of yore ever reach or
could reach
he wa go along entir absorb in these fanci when sancho said
to him isnt it odd seor that i have still befor my ey that
monstrou enorm nose of my gossip tom cecial
and dost thou then believ sancho said don quixot that the
knight of the mirror wa the bachelor carrasco and hi squir tom
cecial thy gossip
i dont know what to sai to that repli sancho all i know is that
the token he gave me about my own hous wife and children nobodi
els but himself could have given me and the face onc the nose wa
off wa the veri face of tom cecial as i have seen it mani a time in
my town and next door to my own hous and the sound of the voic wa
just the same
let us reason the matter sancho said don quixot come now by
what process of think can it be suppos that the bachelor samson
carrasco would come as a knighterr in arm offens and
defens to fight with me have i ever been by ani chanc hi enemi
have i ever given him ani occas to ow me a grudg am i hi rival
or doe he profess arm that he should envi the fame i have acquir
in them
well but what ar we to sai seor return sancho about that
knight whoever he is be so like the bachelor carrasco and hi
squir so like my gossip tom cecial and if that be enchant as
your worship sai wa there no other pair in the world for them to
take the like of
it is all said don quixot a scheme and plot of the malign
magician that persecut me who forese that i wa to be
victori in the conflict arrang that the vanquish knight should
displai the counten of my friend the bachelor in order that the
friendship i bear him should interpos to stai the edg of my sword and
might of my arm and temper the just wrath of my heart so that he who
sought to take my life by fraud and falsehood should save hi own and
to prove it thou knowest alreadi sancho by experi which cannot
lie or deceiv how easi it is for enchant to chang on counten
into anoth turn fair into foul and foul into fair for it is not
two dai sinc thou sawest with thine own ey the beauti and eleg
of the peerless dulcinea in all it perfect and natur harmoni
while i saw her in the repuls and mean form of a coars countri
wench with cataract in her ey and a foul smell in her mouth and
when the pervers enchant ventur to effect so wick a
transform it is no wonder if he effect that of samson carrasco
and thy gossip in order to snatch the glori of victori out of my grasp
for all that howev i consol myself becaus after all in
whatev shape he mai have been i have been victori over my enemi
god know what the truth of it all said sancho and know as he
did that the transform of dulcinea had been a devic and
imposit of hi own hi master illus were not satisfactori to
him but he did not like to repli lest he should sai someth that
might disclos hi trickeri
as thei were engag in thi convers thei were overtaken by a man
who wa follow the same road behind them mount on a veri handsom
fleabitten mare and dress in a gaban of fine green cloth with
tawni velvet face and a montera of the same velvet the trap
of the mare were of the field and jineta fashion and of mulberri
colour and green he carri a moorish cutlass hang from a broad
green and gold baldric the buskin were of the same make as the
baldric the spur were not gilt but lacquer green and so brightli
polish that match as thei did the rest of hi apparel thei
look better than if thei had been of pure gold
when the travel came up with them he salut them courteous and
spur hi mare wa pass them without stop but don quixot
call out to him gallant sir if so be your worship is go our
road and ha no occas for speed it would be a pleasur to me if we
were to join compani
in truth repli he on the mare i would not pass you so hastili
but for fear that hors might turn restiv in the compani of my mare
you mai safe hold in your mare seor said sancho in repli to
thi for our hors is the most virtuou and wellbehav hors in the
world he never doe anyth wrong on such occas and the onli
time he misbehav my master and i suffer for it sevenfold i sai
again your worship mai pull up if you like for if she wa offer to
him between two plate the hors would not hanker after her
the travel drew rein amaz at the trim and featur of don
quixot who rode without hi helmet which sancho carri like a
valis in front of dappl packsaddl and if the man in green
examin don quixot close still more close did don quixot
examin the man in green who struck him as be a man of
intellig in appear he wa about fifti year of ag with but
few grei hair an aquilin cast of featur and an express between
grave and gai and hi dress and accoutr show him to be a man
of good condit what he in green thought of don quixot of la mancha
wa that a man of that sort and shape he had never yet seen he
marvel at the length of hi hair hi lofti statur the lank

courteou as he wa and readi to pleas everybodi befor the other
could ask him ani question he anticip him by sai the

in print to wellnigh all or most of the nation of the earth thirti
thousand volum of my histori have been print and it is on the
highroad to be print thirti thousand thousand of time if heaven
doe not put a stop to it in short to sum up all in a few word or
in a singl on i mai tell you i am don quixot of la mancha
otherwis call the knight of the rueful counten for though
selfprais is degrad i must perforc sound my own sometim that

thi squir nor all these arm put togeth nor the sallow of my
counten nor my gaunt lean will henceforth astonish you now
that you know who i am and what profess i follow
with these word don quixot held hi peac and from the time he took
to answer the man in green seem to be at a loss for a repli after a
long paus howev he said to him you were right when you saw
curios in my amaz sir knight but you have not succeed in
remov the astonish i feel at see you for although you sai
seor that know who you ar ought to remov it it ha not done so
on the contrari now that i know i am left more amaz and astonish
than befor what is it possibl that there ar knightserr in the
world in these dai and histori of real chivalri print i cannot
realis the fact that there can be anyon on earth nowadai who aid
widow or protect maiden or defend wive or succour orphan nor
should i believ it had i not seen it in your worship with my own ey
bless be heaven for by mean of thi histori of your nobl and
genuin chivalr deed which you sai ha been print the countless
stori of fictiti knightserr with which the world is fill so
much to the injuri of moral and the prejudic and discredit of good
histori will have been driven into oblivion
there is a good deal to be said on that point said don quixot as
to whether the histori of the knightserr ar fiction or not
why is there anyon who doubt that those histori ar fals said
the man in green
i doubt it said don quixot but never mind that just now if our
journei last long enough i trust in god i shall show your worship
that you do wrong in go with the stream of those who regard it as a
matter of certainti that thei ar not true
from thi last observ of don quixot the travel began to
have a suspicion that he wa some crazi be and wa wait for him
to confirm it by someth further but befor thei could turn to ani
new subject don quixot beg him to tell him who he wa sinc he
himself had render account of hi station and life to thi he in

sancho listen with the greatest attent to the account of the
gentleman life and occup and think it a good and a holi
life and that he who led it ought to work miracl he threw himself
off dappl and run in hast seiz hi right stirrup and kiss
hi foot again and again with a devout heart and almost with tear
see thi the gentleman ask him what ar you about brother what
ar these kiss for
let me kiss said sancho for i think your worship is the first
saint in the saddl i ever saw all the dai of my life
i am no saint repli the gentleman but a great sinner but you
ar brother for you must be a good fellow as your simplic show
sancho went back and regain hi packsaddl have extract a laugh
from hi master profound melancholi and excit fresh amaz in
don diego don quixot then ask him how mani children he had and
observ that on of the thing wherein the ancient philosoph who
were without the true knowledg of god place the summum bonum wa
in the gift of natur in those of fortun in have mani friend
and mani and good children
i seor don quixot answer the gentleman have on son without
whom perhap i should count myself happier than i am not becaus he
is a bad son but becaus he is not so good as i could wish he is
eighteen year of ag he ha been for six at salamanca studi latin
and greek and when i wish him to turn to the studi of other scienc
i found him so wrap up in that of poetri if that can be call a
scienc that there is no get him to take kindli to the law which
i wish him to studi or to theologi the queen of them all i would
like him to be an honour to hi famili as we live in dai when our
king liber reward learn that is virtuou and worthi for
learn without virtu is a pearl on a dunghil he spend the whole
dai in settl whether homer express himself correctli or not in
such and such a line of the iliad whether martial wa indec or not
in such and such an epigram whether such and such line of virgil ar
to be understood in thi wai or in that in short all hi talk is of
the work of these poet and those of horac perseu juven and
tibullu for of the modern in our own languag he make no great
account but with all hi seem indiffer to spanish poetri just
now hi thought ar absorb in make a gloss on four line that have
been sent him from salamanca which i suspect ar for some poetic
tournament
to all thi don quixot said in repli children seor ar portion
of their parent bowel and therefor be thei good or bad ar to be
love as we love the soul that give us life it is for the parent to
guid them from infanc in the wai of virtu proprieti and worthi
christian conduct so that when grown up thei mai be the staff of their
parent old ag and the glori of their poster and to forc them
to studi thi or that scienc i do not think wise though it mai be no
harm to persuad them and when there is no need to studi for the sake
of pane lucrando and it is the student good fortun that heaven
ha given him parent who provid him with it it would be my advic to
them to let him pursu whatev scienc thei mai see him most inclin
to and though that of poetri is less us than pleasur it is
not on of those that bring discredit upon the possessor poetri
gentl sir is as i take it like a tender young maiden of suprem
beauti to arrai bedeck and adorn whom is the task of sever other
maiden who ar all the rest of the scienc and she must avail
herself of the help of all and all deriv their lustr from her but
thi maiden will not bear to be handl nor drag through the
street nor expos either at the corner of the marketplac or in
the closet of palac she is the product of an alchemi of such virtu
that he who is abl to practis it will turn her into pure gold of
inestim worth he that possess her must keep her within bound
not permit her to break out in ribald satir or soulless sonnet
she must on no account be offer for sale unless inde it be in
heroic poem move tragedi or sprightli and ingeni comedi
she must not be touch by the buffoon nor by the ignor vulgar
incap of comprehend or appreci her hidden treasur and do
not suppos seor that i appli the term vulgar here mere to
plebeian and the lower order for everyon who is ignor be he
lord or princ mai and should be includ among the vulgar he then
who shall embrac and cultiv poetri under the condit i have
name shall becom famou and hi name honour throughout all the
civilis nation of the earth and with regard to what you sai seor
of your son have no great opinion of spanish poetri i am inclin to
think that he is not quit right there and for thi reason the great
poet homer did not write in latin becaus he wa a greek nor did
virgil write in greek becaus he wa a latin in short all the
ancient poet wrote in the languag thei imbib with their mother
milk and never went in quest of foreign on to express their sublim
concept and that be so the usag should in justic extend to
all nation and the german poet should not be undervalu becaus he
write in hi own languag nor the castilian nor even the biscayan
for write in hi but your son seor i suspect is not prejud
against spanish poetri but against those poet who ar mere spanish
vers writer without ani knowledg of other languag or scienc to
adorn and give life and vigour to their natur inspir and yet
even in thi he mai be wrong for accord to a true belief a poet
is born on that is to sai the poet by natur come forth a poet from
hi mother womb and follow the bent that heaven ha bestow upon
him without the aid of studi or art he produc thing that show how
truli he spoke who said est deu in nobi etc at the same time
i sai that the poet by natur who call in art to hi aid will be a far
better poet and will surpass him who tri to be on reli upon hi
knowledg of art alon the reason is that art doe not surpass
natur but onli bring it to perfect and thu natur combin
with art and art with natur will produc a perfect poet to bring my
argument to a close i would sai then gentl sir let your son go on
as hi star lead him for be so studiou as he seem to be and
have alreadi successfulli surmount the first step of the scienc
which is that of the languag with their help he will by hi own
exert reach the summit of polit literatur which so well becom
an independ gentleman and adorn honour and distinguish him
as much as the mitr doe the bishop or the gown the learn
counsellor if your son write satir reflect on the honour of
other chide and correct him and tear them up but if he compos
discours in which he rebuk vice in gener in the style of horac
and with eleg like hi commend him for it is legitim for a
poet to write against envi and lash the enviou in hi vers and the
other vice too provid he doe not singl out individu there
ar howev poet who for the sake of sai someth spite
would run the risk of be banish to the coast of pontu if the
poet be pure in hi moral he will be pure in hi vers too the pen
is the tongu of the mind and as the thought engend there so will
be the thing that it write down and when king and princ observ
thi marvel scienc of poetri in wise virtuou and thought
subject thei honour valu exalt them and even crown them with the
leav of that tree which the thunderbolt strike not as if to show
that thei whose brow ar honour and adorn with such a crown ar
not to be assail by anyon
he of the green gaban wa fill with astonish at don quixot
argument so much so that he began to abandon the notion he had taken
up about hi be crazi but in the middl of the discours it be
not veri much to hi tast sancho had turn asid out of the road to
beg a littl milk from some shepherd who were milk their ew hard
by and just as the gentleman highli pleas wa about to renew the
convers don quixot rais hi head perceiv a cart cover
with royal flag come along the road thei were travel and
persuad that thi must be some new adventur he call aloud to
sancho to come and bring him hi helmet sancho hear himself

to see what hi master want with him he as he approach exclaim
to him

he of the green gaban on hear thi look in all direct but
could perceiv noth except a cart come toward them with two or
three small flag which led him to conclud it must be carri
treasur of the king and he said so to don quixot he howev
would not believ him be alwai persuad and convinc that all
that happen to him must be adventur and still more adventur so
he repli to the gentleman he who is prepar ha hi battl half

experi that i have enemi visibl and invis and i know not
when or where or at what moment or in what shape thei will attack
me and turn to sancho he call for hi helmet and sancho as he
had no time to take out the curd had to give it just as it wa don
quixot took it and without perceiv what wa in it thrust it down
in hot hast upon hi head but as the curd were press and squeez

startl that he cri out to sancho

inde from fear i am convinc beyond a doubt that the adventur
which is about to befal me is a terribl on give me someth to
wipe myself with if thou hast it for thi profus sweat is blind
me
sancho held hi tongu and gave him a cloth and gave thank to god at
the same time that hi master had not found out what wa the matter
don quixot then wipe himself and took off hi helmet to see what it
wa that made hi head feel so cool and see all that white mash
insid hi helmet he put it to hi nose and as soon as he had smelt it
he exclaim
by the life of my ladi dulcinea del toboso but it is curd thou hast
put here thou treacher impud illmann squir
to which with great composur and pretend innoc sancho repli
if thei ar curd let me have them your worship and ill eat them
but let the devil eat them for it must have been he who put them
there i dare to dirti your helmet you have guess the offend

for all the harm and mischief which these beast mai do and for my
salari and due as well you gentlemen place yourselv in safeti
befor i open for i know thei will do me no harm
onc more the gentleman strove to persuad don quixot not to do such a
mad thing as it wa tempt god to engag in such a piec of folli
to thi don quixot repli that he knew what he wa about the
gentleman in return entreat him to reflect for he knew he wa under
a delus

him from the claw of the lion and he curs hi fate and call it
an unlucki hour when he thought of take servic with him again but
with all hi tear and lament he did not forget to thrash dappl
so as to put a good space between himself and the cart the keeper
see that the fugit were now some distanc off onc more
entreat and warn him as befor but he repli that he heard him
and that he need not troubl himself with ani further warn or
entreati as thei would be fruitless and bade him make hast
dure the delai that occur while the keeper wa open the first
cage don quixot wa consid whether it would not be well to do
battl on foot instead of on horseback and final resolv to fight
on foot fear that rocinant might take fright at the sight of the

here the author outburst came to an end and he proceed to take up
the thread of hi stori sai that the keeper see that don
quixot had taken up hi posit and that it wa imposs for him
to avoid let out the male without incur the enmiti of the fieri
and dare knight flung open the door of the first cage contain
as ha been said the lion which wa now seen to be of enorm size
and grim and hideou mien the first thing he did wa to turn round in
the cage in which he lai and protrud hi claw and stretch himself
thoroughli he next open hi mouth and yawn veri leisur and
with near two palm length of tongu that he had thrust forth he
lick the dust out of hi ey and wash hi face have done thi
he put hi head out of the cage and look all round with ey like
glow coal a spectacl and demeanour to strike terror into temer
itself don quixot mere observ him steadili long for him to
leap from the cart and come to close quarter with him when he hope
to hew him in piec
so far did hi unparallel mad go but the nobl lion more
courteou than arrog not troubl himself about silli bravado
after have look all round as ha been said turn about and
present hi hindquart to don quixot and veri coolli and
tranquilli lai down again in the cage see thi don quixot order
the keeper to take a stick to him and provok him to make him come out
that i wont said the keeper for if i anger him the first hell
tear in piec will be myself be satisfi sir knight with what you
have done which leav noth more to be said on the score of
courag and do not seek to tempt fortun a second time the lion ha
the door open he is free to come out or not to come out but as he ha
not come out so far he will not come out todai your worship great
courag ha been fulli manifest alreadi no brave champion so it
strike me is bound to do more than challeng hi enemi and wait for
him on the field if hi adversari doe not come on him li the
disgrac and he who wait for him carri off the crown of victori
that is true said don quixot close the door my friend and let
me have in the best form thou canst what thou hast seen me do by wai
of certif to wit that thou didst open for the lion that i
wait for him that he did not come out that i still wait for him
and that still he did not come out and lai down again i am not bound
to do more enchant avaunt and god uphold the right the truth
and true chivalri close the door as i bade thee while i make signal
to the fugit that have left us that thei mai learn thi exploit
from thy lip
the keeper obei and don quixot fix on the point of hi lanc
the cloth he had wipe hi face with after the delug of curd
proceed to recal the other who still continu to fly look
back at everi step all in a bodi the gentleman bring up the rear
sancho howev happen to observ the signal of the white cloth
exclaim mai i die if my master ha not overcom the wild beast
for he is call to us
thei all stop and perceiv that it wa don quixot who wa make
signal and shake off their fear to some extent thei approach
slowli until thei were near enough to hear distinctli don quixot
voic call to them thei return at length to the cart and as thei
came up don quixot said to the carter put your mule to onc more
brother and continu your journei and do thou sancho give him two
gold crown for himself and the keeper to compens for the delai
thei have incur through me
that will i give with all my heart said sancho but what ha becom
of the lion ar thei dead or aliv
the keeper then in full detail and bit by bit describ the end of
the contest exalt to the best of hi power and abil the valour
of don quixot at the sight of whom the lion quail and would not
and dare not come out of the cage although he had held the door open
ever so long and show how in consequ of hi have repres
to the knight that it wa tempt god to provok the lion in order to
forc him out which he wish to have done he veri reluctantli and
altogeth against hi will had allow the door to be close
what dost thou think of thi sancho said don quixot ar there
ani enchant that can prevail against true valour the enchant
mai be abl to rob me of good fortun but of fortitud and courag
thei cannot
sancho paid the crown the carter put to the keeper kiss don
quixot hand for the bounti bestow upon him and promis to give
an account of the valiant exploit to the king himself as soon as he
saw him at court
then said don quixot if hi majesti should happen to ask who
perform it you must sai the knight of the lion for it is my desir
that into thi the name i have hitherto born of knight of the rueful
counten be from thi time forward chang alter transform
and turn and in thi i follow the ancient usag of knightserr
who chang their name when thei pleas or when it suit their
purpos
the cart went it wai and don quixot sancho and he of the green
gaban went their all thi time don diego de miranda had not spoken a
word be entir taken up with observ and note all that don
quixot did and said and the opinion he form wa that he wa a man
of brain gone mad and a madman on the verg of ration the first
part of hi histori had not yet reach him for had he read it the
amaz with which hi word and deed fill him would have
vanish as he would then have understood the natur of hi mad
but know noth of it he took him to be ration on moment and
crazi the next for what he said wa sensibl eleg and well
express and what he did absurd rash and foolish and said he to
himself what could be madder than put on a helmet full of curd
and then persuad oneself that enchant ar soften on skull
or what could be greater rash and folli than want to fight lion
tooth and nail
don quixot rous him from these reflect and thi soliloqui by
sai no doubt seor don diego de miranda you set me down in your
mind as a fool and a madman and it would be no wonder if you did for
my deed do not argu anyth els but for all that i would have you
take notic that i am neither so mad nor so foolish as i must have
seem to you a gallant knight show to advantag bring hi lanc
to bear adroitli upon a fierc bull under the ey of hi sovereign in
the midst of a spaciou plaza a knight show to advantag arrai in
glitter armour pace the list befor the ladi in some joyou
tournament and all those knight show to advantag that entertain
divert and if we mai sai so honour the court of their princ by
warlik exercis or what resembl them but to greater advantag than
all these doe a knighterr show when he travers desert
solitud crossroad forest and mountain in quest of peril
adventur bent on bring them to a happi and success issu all
to win a gloriou and last renown to greater advantag i maintain
doe the knighterr show bring aid to some widow in some lone
wast than the court knight dalli with some citi damsel all
knight have their own special part to plai let the courtier devot
himself to the ladi let him add lustr to hi sovereign court by
hi liveri let him entertain poor gentlemen with the sumptuou fare
of hi tabl let him arrang joust marshal tournament and prove
himself nobl gener and magnific and abov all a good
christian and so do he will fulfil the duti that ar especi
hi but let the knighterr explor the corner of the earth and
penetr the most intric labyrinth at each step let him attempt
imposs on desol heath let him endur the burn rai of
the midsumm sun and the bitter inclem of the winter wind and
frost let no lion daunt him no monster terrifi him no dragon
make him quail for to seek these to attack those and to vanquish
all ar in truth hi main duti i then as it ha fallen to my lot
to be a member of knighterrantri cannot avoid attempt all that to
me seem to come within the sphere of my duti thu it wa my bounden
duti to attack those lion that i just now attack although i knew it
to be the height of rash for i know well what valour is that it
is a virtu that occupi a place between two viciou extrem
cowardic and temer but it will be a lesser evil for him who is
valiant to rise till he reach the point of rash than to sink
until he reach the point of cowardic for as it is easier for the
prodig than for the miser to becom gener so it is easier for a
rash man to prove truli valiant than for a coward to rise to true
valour and believ me seor don diego in attempt adventur it is
better to lose by a card too mani than by a card too few for to hear
it said such a knight is rash and dare sound better than such a
knight is timid and cowardli
i protest seor don quixot said don diego everyth you have
said and done is prove correct by the test of reason itself and i
believ if the law and ordin of knighterrantri should be lost
thei might be found in your worship breast as in their own proper
depositori and munimenthous but let us make hast and reach my
villag where you shall take rest after your late exert for if
thei have not been of the bodi thei have been of the spirit and these
sometim tend to produc bodili fatigu
i take the invit as a great favour and honour seor don diego
repli don quixot and press forward at a better pace than befor

best to pass over these and other detail of the same sort in silenc
as thei ar not in harmoni with the main purpos of the stori the
strong point of which is truth rather than dull digress
thei led don quixot into a room and sancho remov hi armour
leav him in loos walloon breech and chamoisleath doublet all
stain with the rust of hi armour hi collar wa a fall on of
scholast cut without starch or lace hi buskin buffcolour and
hi shoe polish he wore hi good sword which hung in a baldric of
seawolf skin for he had suffer for mani year thei sai from an
ailment of the kidnei and over all he threw a long cloak of good grei
cloth but first of all with five or six bucket of water for as
regard the number of bucket there is some disput he wash hi head
and face and still the water remain wheycolour thank to
sancho greedi and purchas of those unlucki curd that turn hi
master so white thu arrai and with an easi sprightli and gallant
air don quixot pass out into anoth room where the student wa
wait to entertain him while the tabl wa be laid for on the
arriv of so distinguish a guest doa christina wa anxiou to show
that she knew how and wa abl to give a becom recept to those
who came to her hous
while don quixot wa take off hi armour don lorenzo for so don
diego son wa call took the opportun to sai to hi father
what ar we to make of thi gentleman you have brought home to us
sir for hi name hi appear and your describ him as a
knighterr have complet puzzl my mother and me
i dont know what to sai my son repli don diego all i can tell
thee is that i have seen him act the act of the greatest madman in the
world and heard him make observ so sensibl that thei effac and
undo all he doe do thou talk to him and feel the puls of hi wit
and as thou art shrewd form the most reason conclus thou canst
as to hi wisdom or folli though to tell the truth i am more
inclin to take him to be mad than sane
with thi don lorenzo went awai to entertain don quixot as ha been
said and in the cours of the convers that pass between them
don quixot said to don lorenzo your father seor don diego de
miranda ha told me of the rare abil and subtl intellect you
possess and abov all that you ar a great poet
a poet it mai be repli don lorenzo but a great on by no
mean it is true that i am somewhat given to poetri and to read
good poet but not so much so as to justifi the titl of great which
my father give me
i do not dislik that modesti said don quixot for there is no
poet who is not conceit and doe not think he is the best poet in the
world
there is no rule without an except said don lorenzo there mai
be some who ar poet and yet do not think thei ar
veri few said don quixot but tell me what vers ar those which
you have now in hand and which your father tell me keep you somewhat
restless and absorb if it be some gloss i know someth about
gloss and i should like to hear them and if thei ar for a poetic
tournament contriv to carri off the second prize for the first
alwai goe by favour or person stand the second by simpl
justic and so the third come to be the second and the first
reckon in thi wai will be third in the same wai as licenti
degre ar confer at the univers but for all that the titl
of first is a great distinct
so far said don lorenzo to himself i should not take you to be a
madman but let us go on so he said to him your worship ha
appar attend the school what scienc have you studi
that of knighterrantri said don quixot which is as good as that
of poetri and even a finger or two abov it
i do not know what scienc that is said don lorenzo and until now
i have never heard of it
it is a scienc said don quixot that comprehend in itself all or
most of the scienc in the world for he who profess it must be a
jurist and must know the rule of justic distribut and equit
so as to give to each on what belong to him and is due to him he
must be a theologian so as to be abl to give a clear and distinct
reason for the christian faith he profess wherev it mai be ask
of him he must be a physician and abov all a herbalist so as in
wast and solitud to know the herb that have the properti of
heal wound for a knighterr must not go look for someon to
cure him at everi step he must be an astronom so as to know by the
star how mani hour of the night have pass and what clime and
quarter of the world he is in he must know mathemat for at everi
turn some occas for them will present itself to him and put it
asid that he must be adorn with all the virtu cardin and
theolog to come down to minor particular he must i sai be abl
to swim as well as nichola or nicolao the fish could as the stori
goe he must know how to shoe a hors and repair hi saddl and
bridl and to return to higher matter he must be faith to god
and to hi ladi he must be pure in thought decor in word
gener in work valiant in deed patient in suffer
compassion toward the needi and lastli an uphold of the truth
though it defenc should cost him hi life of all these qualiti
great and small is a true knighterr made up judg then seor don
lorenzo whether it be a contempt scienc which the knight who
studi and profess it ha to learn and whether it mai not compar
with the veri loftiest that ar taught in the school
if that be so repli don lorenzo thi scienc i protest
surpass all
how if that be so said don quixot
what i mean to sai said don lorenzo is that i doubt whether there
ar now or ever were ani knightserr and adorn with such
virtu
mani a time repli don quixot have i said what i now sai onc
more that the major of the world ar of opinion that there never
were ani knightserr in it and as it is my opinion that unless
heaven by some miracl bring home to them the truth that there were
and ar all the pain on take will be in vain as experi ha
often prove to me i will not now stop to disabus you of the error
you share with the multitud all i shall do is to prai to heaven to
deliv you from it and show you how benefici and necessari
knightserr were in dai of yore and how us thei would be in
these dai were thei but in vogu but now for the sin of the peopl
sloth and indol gluttoni and luxuri ar triumphant
our guest ha broken out on our hand said don lorenzo to himself at
thi point but for all that he is a gloriou madman and i should
be a dull blockhead to doubt it
here be summon to dinner thei brought their colloqui to a close
don diego ask hi son what he had been abl to make out as to the
wit of their guest to which he repli all the doctor and clever
scribe in the world will not make sens of the scrawl of hi mad
he is a madman full of streak full of lucid interv
thei went in to dinner and the repast wa such as don diego said on
the road he wa in the habit of give to hi guest neat plenti
and tasti but what pleas don quixot most wa the marvel silenc
that reign throughout the hous for it wa like a carthusian
monasteri
when the cloth had been remov grace said and their hand wash don
quixot earnestli press don lorenzo to repeat to him hi vers for
the poetic tournament to which he repli not to be like those
poet who when thei ar ask to recit their vers refus and when
thei ar not ask for them vomit them up i will repeat my gloss for
which i do not expect ani prize have compos it mere as an
exercis of ingenu
a discern friend of mine said don quixot wa of opinion that
no on ought to wast labour in gloss vers and the reason he gave
wa that the gloss can never come up to the text and that often or
most frequent it wander awai from the mean and purpos aim at
in the gloss line and besid that the law of the gloss were too
strict as thei did not allow interrog nor said he nor i
sai nor turn verb into noun or alter the construct not
to speak of other restrict and limit that fetter
glosswrit as you no doubt know
verili seor don quixot said don lorenzo i wish i could catch
your worship trip at a stretch but i cannot for you slip through
my finger like an eel
i dont understand what you sai or mean by slip said don
quixot
i will explain myself anoth time said don lorenzo for the
present prai attend to the gloss vers and the gloss which run
thu
could wa becom an is for me
then would i ask no more than thi
or could for me the time that is
becom the time that is to be

dame fortun onc upon a dai
to me wa bounti and kind
but all thing chang she chang her mind
and what she gave she took awai

no other prize i seek to gain

then would i ask no more than thi

come back to us and be again
no power on earth can bring to pass

and dy seek releas from pain
and yet thought were the best for me
anon the thought asid i fling
and to the present fondli cling
and dread the time that is to be
when don lorenzo had finish recit hi gloss don quixot stood up
and in a loud voic almost a shout exclaim as he grasp don
lorenzo right hand in hi by the highest heaven nobl youth but
you ar the best poet on earth and deserv to be crown with laurel
not by cypru or by gaetaa a certain poet god forgiv him saidbut
by the academi of athen if thei still flourish and by those that
flourish now pari bologna salamanca heaven grant that the judg
who rob you of the first prizethat phbu mai pierc them with hi
arrow and the muse never cross the threshold of their door repeat
me some of your longmeasur vers seor if you will be so good for
i want thoroughli to feel the puls of your rare geniu
is there ani need to sai that don lorenzo enjoi hear himself
prais by don quixot albeit he look upon him as a madman power of
flatteri how farreach art thou and how wide ar the bound of thy
pleasant jurisdict don lorenzo gave a proof of it for he compli
with don quixot request and entreati and repeat to him thi
sonnet on the fabl or stori of pyramu and thisb
sonnet
the love maid she pierc now the wall
heartpierc by her young pyramu doth lie
and love spread wing from cypru isl to fly
a chink to view so wondrou great and small
there silenc speaketh for no voic at all

where to all other power twere vain to try

the rash maid win the fatal spot where she
sink not in lover arm but death embrac
so run the strang tale how the lover twain
on sword on sepulchr on memori
slai and entomb and bring to life again
bless be god said don quixot when he had heard don lorenzo
sonnet that among the host there ar of irrit poet i have found
on consumm on which seor the art of thi sonnet prove to me
that you ar
for four dai wa don quixot most sumptuous entertain in don
diego hous at the end of which time he ask hi permiss to
depart tell him he thank him for the kind and hospit he
had receiv in hi hous but that as it did not becom
knightserr to give themselv up for long to idl and luxuri
he wa anxiou to fulfil the duti of hi call in seek
adventur of which he wa inform there wa an abund in that
neighbourhood where he hope to emploi hi time until the dai came
round for the joust at saragossa for that wa hi proper destin
and that first of all he meant to enter the cave of montesino of
which so mani marvel thing were report all through the countri
and at the same time to investig and explor the origin and true
sourc of the seven lake commonli call the lake of ruidera
don diego and hi son commend hi laudabl resolut and bade him
furnish himself with all he want from their hous and belong as
thei would most gladli be of servic to him which inde hi
person worth and hi honour profess made incumb upon them
the dai of hi departur came at length as welcom to don quixot as
it wa sad and sorrow to sancho panza who wa veri well satisfi
with the abund of don diego hous and object to return to the
starvat of the wood and wild and the shortcommon of hi
illstock alforja these howev he fill and pack with what he
consid need on take leav don quixot said to don lorenzo
i know not whether i have told you alreadi but if i have i tell you
onc more that if you wish to spare yourself fatigu and toil in
reach the inaccess summit of the templ of fame you have
noth to do but to turn asid out of the somewhat narrow path of
poetri and take the still narrow on of knighterrantri wide enough
howev to make you an emperor in the twinkl of an ey
in thi speech don quixot wound up the evid of hi mad but
still better in what he ad when he said god know i would gladli
take don lorenzo with me to teach him how to spare the humbl and
trampl the proud under foot virtu that ar part and parcel of the
profess i belong to but sinc hi tender ag doe not allow of it
nor hi praiseworthi pursuit permit it i will simpli content myself
with impress it upon your worship that you will becom famou as a
poet if you ar guid by the opinion of other rather than by your
own becaus no father or mother ever think their own children
illfavour and thi sort of decept prevail still more strongli
in the case of the children of the brain
both father and son were amaz afresh at the strang medlei don
quixot talk at on moment sens at anoth nonsens and at the
pertinac and persist he displai in go through thick and
thin in quest of hi unlucki adventur which he made the end and aim
of hi desir there wa a renew of offer of servic and

don quixot had gone but a short distanc beyond don diego villag
when he fell in with a coupl of either priest or student and a
coupl of peasant mount on four beast of the ass kind on of the
student carri wrap up in a piec of green buckram by wai of a
portmanteau what seem to be a littl linen and a coupl of pair of
rib stock the other carri noth but a pair of new
fencingfoil with button the peasant carri diver articl that
show thei were on their wai from some larg town where thei had
bought them and were take them home to their villag and both
student and peasant were struck with the same amaz that
everybodi felt who saw don quixot for the first time and were dy
to know who thi man so differ from ordinari men could be don
quixot salut them and after ascertain that their road wa the
same as hi made them an offer of hi compani and beg them to
slacken their pace as their young ass travel faster than hi
hors and then to gratifi them he told them in a few word who he
wa and the call and profess he follow which wa that of a
knighterr seek adventur in all part of the world he inform
them that hi own name wa don quixot of la mancha and that he wa
call by wai of surnam the knight of the lion
all thi wa greek or gibberish to the peasant but not so to the
student who veri soon perceiv the crack in don quixot pate for
all that howev thei regard him with admir and respect and
on of them said to him if you sir knight have no fix road as it
is the wai with those who seek adventur not to have ani let your
worship come with us you will see on of the finest and richest
wed that up to thi dai have ever been celebr in la mancha or
for mani a leagu round
don quixot ask him if it wa some princ that he spoke of it in
thi wai not at all said the student it is the wed of a
farmer and a farmer daughter he the richest in all thi countri and
she the fairest mortal ever set ey on the displai with which it is
to be attend will be someth rare and out of the common for it
will be celebr in a meadow adjoin the town of the bride who is
call par excel quiteria the fair as the bridegroom is
call camacho the rich she is eighteen and he twentytwo and thei
ar fairli match though some know on who have all the
pedigre in the world by heart will have it that the famili of the
fair quiteria is better than camacho but no on mind that
nowadai for wealth can solder a great mani flaw at ani rate
camacho is freehand and it is hi fanci to screen the whole meadow
with bough and cover it in overhead so that the sun will have hard
work if he tri to get in to reach the grass that cover the soil he
ha provid dancer too not onli sword but also belldanc for in
hi own town there ar those who ring the chang and jingl the bell
to perfect of shoedanc i sai noth for of them he ha
engag a host but none of these thing nor of the mani other i have
omit to mention will do more to make thi a memor wed than
the part which i suspect the despair basilio will plai in it thi
basilio is a youth of the same villag as quiteria and he live in the
hous next door to that of her parent of which circumst love took
advantag to reproduc to the word the longforgotten love of pyramu
and thisb for basilio love quiteria from hi earliest year and she
respond to hi passion with countless modest proof of affect so
that the love of the two children basilio and quiteria were the talk
and the amus of the town as thei grew up the father of quiteria
made up hi mind to refus basilio hi wont freedom of access to the
hous and to reliev himself of constant doubt and suspicion he
arrang a match for hi daughter with the rich camacho as he did not
approv of marri her to basilio who had not so larg a share of the
gift of fortun as of natur for if the truth be told ungrudgingli
he is the most agil youth we know a mighti thrower of the bar a
firstrat wrestler and a great ballplay he run like a deer and
leap better than a goat bowl over the ninepin as if by magic
sing like a lark plai the guitar so as to make it speak and abov
all handl a sword as well as the best
for that excel alon said don quixot at thi the youth
deserv to marri not mere the fair quiteria but queen guinever
herself were she aliv now in spite of launcelot and all who would
try to prevent it
sai that to my wife said sancho who had until now listen in
silenc for she wont hear of anyth but each on marri hi
equal hold with the proverb each ew to her like what i would
like is that thi good basilio for i am begin to take a fanci to
him alreadi should marri thi ladi quiteria and a bless and good
lucki meant to sai the oppositeon peopl who would prevent those who
love on anoth from marri
if all those who love on anoth were to marri said don quixot
it would depriv parent of the right to choos and marri their
children to the proper person and at the proper time and if it wa
left to daughter to choos husband as thei pleas on would be for
choos her father servant and anoth someon she ha seen
pass in the street and fanci gallant and dash though he mai be
a drunken bulli for love and fanci easili blind the ey of the
judgment so much want in choos on wai of life and the
matrimoni choic is veri liabl to error and it need great caution
and the special favour of heaven to make it a good on he who ha to
make a long journei will if he is wise look out for some trusti and
pleasant companion to accompani him befor he set out why then
should not he do the same who ha to make the whole journei of life
down to the final haltingplac of death more especi when the
companion ha to be hi companion in bed at board and everywher as
the wife is to her husband the companionship of on wife is no
articl of merchandis that after it ha been bought mai be
return or barter or chang for it is an insepar accid
that last as long as life last it is a noos that onc you put it
round your neck turn into a gordian knot which if the scyth of
death doe not cut it there is no unti i could sai a great deal
more on thi subject were i not prevent by the anxieti i feel to
know if the seor licenti ha anyth more to tell about the stori
of basilio
to thi the student bachelor or as don quixot call him
licenti repli i have noth whatev to sai further but that
from the moment basilio learn that the fair quiteria wa to be
marri to camacho the rich he ha never been seen to smile or heard
to utter ration word and he alwai goe about moodi and deject
talk to himself in a wai that show plainli he is out of hi sens
he eat littl and sleep littl and all he eat is fruit and when he
sleep if he sleep at all it is in the field on the hard earth like
a brute beast sometim he gaze at the sky at other time he fix
hi ey on the earth in such an abstract wai that he might be taken
for a cloth statu with it draperi stir by the wind in short
he show such sign of a heart crush by suffer that all we who
know him believ that when tomorrow the fair quiteria sai ye it
will be hi sentenc of death
god will guid it better said sancho for god who give the wound
give the salv nobodi know what will happen there ar a good mani
hour between thi and tomorrow and ani on of them or ani moment
the hous mai fall i have seen the rain come down and the sun
shine all at on time mani a on goe to bed in good health who
cant stir the next dai and tell me is there anyon who can boast of
have driven a nail into the wheel of fortun no faith and between
a woman ye and no i wouldnt ventur to put the point of a pin
for there would not be room for it if you tell me quiteria love
basilio heart and soul then ill give him a bag of good luck for
love i have heard sai look through spectacl that make copper seem
gold poverti wealth and bleari ey pearl
what art thou drive at sancho curs on thee said don quixot
for when thou takest to string proverb and sai togeth no
on can understand thee but juda himself and i wish he had thee tell
me thou anim what dost thou know about nail or wheel or anyth
els
oh if you dont understand me repli sancho it is no wonder my
word ar taken for nonsens but no matter i understand myself and i
know i have not said anyth veri foolish in what i have said onli
your worship seor is alwai gravel at everyth i sai nai
everyth i do
cavil not gravel said don quixot thou prevar of
honest languag god confound thee
dont find fault with me your worship return sancho for you
know i have not been bred up at court or train at salamanca to know
whether i am ad or drop a letter or so in my word why god
bless me it not fair to forc a sayagoman to speak like a toledan
mayb there ar toledan who do not hit it off when it come to
polish talk
that is true said the licenti for those who have been bred up
in the tanneri and the zocodov cannot talk like those who ar
almost all dai pace the cathedr cloister and yet thei ar all
toledan pure correct eleg and lucid languag will be met with in
men of courtli breed and discrimin though thei mai have been
born in majalahonda i sai of discrimin becaus there ar mani
who ar not so and discrimin is the grammar of good languag if
it be accompani by practic i sir for my sin have studi canon
law at salamanca and i rather piqu myself on express my mean in
clear plain and intellig languag
if you did not piqu yourself more on your dexter with those foil
you carri than on dexter of tongu said the other student you
would have been head of the degre where you ar now tail
look here bachelor corchuelo return the licenti you have the
most mistaken idea in the world about skill with the sword if you
think it useless
it is no idea on my part but an establish truth repli
corchuelo and if you wish me to prove it to you by experi you
have sword there and it is a good opportun i have a steadi hand
and a strong arm and these join with my resolut which is not
small will make you confess that i am not mistaken dismount and put
in practic your posit and circl and angl and scienc for i
hope to make you see star at noondai with my rude raw swordsmanship
in which next to god i place my trust that the man is yet to be born
who will make me turn my back and that there is not on in the world i
will not compel to give ground
as to whether you turn your back or not i do not concern myself
repli the master of fenc though it might be that your grave would
be dug on the spot where you plant your foot the first time i mean
that you would be stretch dead there for despis skill with the
sword
we shall soon see repli corchuelo and get off hi ass
briskli he drew out furious on of the sword the licenti carri
on hi beast
it must not be that wai said don quixot at thi point i will be
the director of thi fenc match and judg of thi often disput
question and dismount from rocinant and grasp hi lanc he
plant himself in the middl of the road just as the licenti with
an easi grace bear and step advanc toward corchuelo who
came on against him dart fire from hi ey as the sai is the
other two of the compani the peasant without dismount from their
ass serv as spectat of the mortal tragedi the cut thrust
down stroke back stroke and doubl that corchuelo deliv were
past count and came thicker than hop or hail he attack like an
angri lion but he wa met by a tap on the mouth from the button of the
licenti sword that check him in the midst of hi furiou onset
and made him kiss it as if it were a relic though not as devoutli as
relic ar and ought to be kiss the end of it wa that the
licenti reckon up for him by thrust everi on of the button of
the short cassock he wore tore the skirt into strip like the tail
of a cuttlefish knock off hi hat twice and so complet tire him
out that in vexat anger and rage he took the sword by the hilt
and flung it awai with such forc that on of the peasant that were
there who wa a notari and who went for it made an affidavit
afterward that he sent it nearli threequart of a leagu which
testimoni will serv and ha serv to show and establish with all
certainti that strength is overcom by skill
corchuelo sat down weari and sancho approach him said by my
faith seor bachelor if your worship take my advic you will never
challeng anyon to fenc again onli to wrestl and throw the bar for
you have the youth and strength for that but as for these fencer as
thei call them i have heard sai thei can put the point of a sword
through the ey of a needl
i am satisfi with have tumbl off my donkei said corchuelo
and with have had the truth i wa so ignor of prove to me by
experi and get up he embrac the licenti and thei were
better friend than ever and not care to wait for the notari who had
gone for the sword as thei saw he would be a long time about it thei
resolv to push on so as to reach the villag of quiteria to which
thei all belong in good time
dure the remaind of the journei the licenti held forth to them
on the excel of the sword with such conclus argument and
such figur and mathemat proof that all were convinc of the
valu of the scienc and corchuelo cure of hi dogmat
it grew dark but befor thei reach the town it seem to them all as
if there wa a heaven full of countless glitter star in front of

instrument flute drum psalteri pipe tabor and timbrel

a smell a great deal more like fri rasher than galingal or thyme a

wit thi bridal and see what the reject basilio doe
let him do what he like return sancho be he not poor he would
marri quiteria to make a grand match for himself and he without a

man should be content with what he can get and not go look for
dainti in the bottom of the sea i will bet my arm that camacho could
buri basilio in real and if that be so as no doubt it is what a
fool quiteria would be to refus the fine dress and jewel camacho
must have given her and will give her and take basilio barthrow
and swordplai thei wont give a pint of wine at the tavern for a good
cast of the bar or a neat thrust of the sword talent and
accomplish that cant be turn into monei let count dirlo have
them but when such gift fall to on that ha hard cash i wish my

will come befor thine so i never expect to see thee dumb not even
when thou art drink or sleep and that is the utmost i can sai

she is reap and cut down as well the dry grass as the green
she never seem to chew but bolt and swallow all that is put befor
her for she ha a canin appetit that is never satisfi and though
she ha no belli she show she ha a dropsi and is athirst to drink
the live of all that live as on would drink a jug of cold water
sai no more sancho said don quixot at thi dont try to better
it and risk a fall for in truth what thou hast said about death in
thy rustic phrase is what a good preacher might have said i tell thee
sancho if thou hadst discret equal to thy mother wit thou mightst
take a pulpit in hand and go about the world preach fine sermon
he preach well who live well said sancho and i know no more
theologi than that

how it is that the fear of god be the begin of wisdom thou
who art more afraid of a lizard than of him knowest so much
pass judgment on your chivalri seor return sancho and dont
set yourself up to judg of other men fear or braveri for i am as
good a fearer of god as my neighbour but leav me to despatch these

becaus of the bad night bride alwai pass dress themselv out for

on on side of the meadow deck with carpet and bough where thei
were to plight their troth and from which thei were to behold the
danc and plai but at the moment of their arriv at the spot thei
heard a loud outcri behind them and a voic exclaim wait a

turn round and perceiv that the speaker wa a man clad in what
seem to be a loos black coat garnish with crimson patch like
flame he wa crown as wa present seen with a crown of gloomi
cypress and in hi hand he held a long staff as he approach he wa
recognis by everyon as the gai basilio and all wait anxious to
see what would come of hi word in dread of some catastroph in
consequ of hi appear at such a moment he came up at last
weari and breathless and plant himself in front of the bridal pair
drove hi staff which had a steel spike at the end into the ground
and with a pale face and ey fix on quiteria he thu address her
in a hoars trembl voic
well dost thou know ungrat quiteria that accord to the holi
law we acknowledg so long as live thou canst take no husband nor art
thou ignor either that in my hope that time and my own exert
would improv my fortun i have never fail to observ the respect
due to thy honour but thou cast behind thee all thou owest to my
true love wouldst surrend what is mine to anoth whose wealth
serv to bring him not onli good fortun but suprem happi and
now to complet it not that i think he deserv it but inasmuch as
heaven is pleas to bestow it upon him i will with my own hand do
awai with the obstacl that mai interfer with it and remov myself
from between you long live the rich camacho mani a happi year mai he
live with the ungrat quiteria and let the poor basilio die
basilio whose poverti clip the wing of hi happi and brought
him to the grave
and so sai he seiz the staff he had driven into the ground and
leav on half of it fix there show it to be a sheath that
conceal a toler long rapier and what mai be call it hilt
be plant in the ground he swiftli coolli and deliber threw
himself upon it and in an instant the bloodi point and half the steel
blade appear at hi back the unhappi man fall to the earth bath
in hi blood and transfix by hi own weapon
hi friend at onc ran to hi aid fill with grief at hi miseri and
sad fate and don quixot dismount from rocinant hasten to
support him and took him in hi arm and found he had not yet ceas
to breath thei were about to draw out the rapier but the priest who
wa stand by object to it be withdrawn befor he had confess
him as the instant of it withdraw would be that of thi death
basilio howev reviv slightli said in a weak voic as though in
pain if thou wouldst consent cruel quiteria to give me thy hand as
my bride in thi last fatal moment i might still hope that my rash
would find pardon as by it mean i attain the bliss of be
thine
hear thi the priest bade him think of the welfar of hi soul
rather than of the crave of the bodi and in all earnest implor
god pardon for hi sin and for hi rash resolv to which basilio
repli that he wa determin not to confess unless quiteria first
gave him her hand in marriag for that happi would compos hi
mind and give him courag to make hi confess
don quixot hear the wound man entreati exclaim aloud that
what basilio ask wa just and reason and moreov a request that
might be easili compli with and that it would be as much to seor
camacho honour to receiv the ladi quiteria as the widow of the brave
basilio as if he receiv her direct from her father
in thi case said he it will be onli to sai ye and no
consequ can follow the utter of the word for the nuptial
couch of thi marriag must be the grave

hand so that hi soul quit thi life in despair should not be
lost that thei move nai forc him to sai that if quiteria were

like a heathen and not like a christian quiteria approach him and
kneel demand hi hand by sign without speak basilio open
hi ey and gaze fixedli at her said o quiteria why hast thou
turn compassion at a moment when thy compass will serv as a
dagger to rob me of life for i have not now the strength left either
to bear the happi thou givest me in accept me as thine or to
suppress the pain that is rapidli draw the dread shadow of death
over my ey what i entreat of thee o thou fatal star to me is that
the hand thou demandest of me and wouldst give me be not given out of

that without ani constraint upon thy will thou givest it to me as to
thy law husband for it is not meet that thou shouldst trifl with
me at such a moment as thi or have recours to falsehood with on
who ha dealt so truli by thee

quiteria overcom with modesti and shame hold in her right hand

therefor as it is possibl for me to do so i give thee the hand of a

power he mai be shall take her from him these two whom god hath
join man cannot separ and he who attempt it must first pass the
point of thi lanc and so sai he brandish it so stoutli and
dexter that he overaw all who did not know him
but so deep an impress had the reject of quiteria made on
camacho mind that it banish her at onc from hi thought and so
the counsel of the priest who wa a wise and kindli dispos man
prevail with him and by their mean he and hi partisan were
pacifi and tranquillis and to prove it put up their sword again
inveigh against the plianci of quiteria rather than the crafti
of basilio camacho maintain that if quiteria as a maiden had such
a love for basilio she would have love him too as a marri woman

have given her
camacho and those of hi follow therefor be consol and

myself am not marri nor so far ha it ever enter my thought to

ask it as to the mode in which he should seek a wife such as he would
be content to marri the first thing i would recommend him would be to
look to good name rather than to wealth for a good woman doe not win
a good name mere by be good but by let it be seen that she is
so and open loos and freedom do much more damag to a woman
honour than secret deprav if you take a good woman into your hous

to the cave of montesino so the cousin told don quixot ad that
if he wa bent upon enter it it would be requisit for him to
provid himself with rope so that he might be ti and lower into
it depth don quixot said that even if it reach to the bottomless
pit he meant to see where it went to so thei bought about a hundr
fathom of rope and next dai at two in the afternoon thei arriv at
the cave the mouth of which is spaciou and wide but full of thorn
and wildfig bush and brambl and briar so thick and mat that
thei complet close it up and cover it over
on come within sight of it the cousin sancho and don quixot
dismount and the first two immedi ti the latter veri firmli
with the rope and as thei were gird and swath him sancho said
to him mind what you ar about master mine dont go buri

sancho panza
when he had said thi and finish the ty which wa not over the
armour but onli over the doublet don quixot observ it wa
careless of us not to have provid ourselv with a small cattlebel
to be ti on the rope close to me the sound of which would show that
i wa still descend and aliv but as that is out of the question
now in god hand be it to guid me and forthwith he fell on hi
knee and in a low voic offer up a prayer to heaven implor god
to aid him and grant him success in thi to all appear peril and
untri adventur and then exclaim aloud o mistress of my action
and movement illustri and peerless dulcinea del toboso if so be
the prayer and supplic of thi fortun lover can reach thy

will not attempt and accomplish with these word he approach the
cavern and perceiv that it wa imposs to let himself down or
effect an entranc except by sheer forc or cleav a passag so
draw hi sword he began to demolish and cut awai the brambl at the
mouth of the cave at the nois of which a vast multitud of crow and
chough flew out of it so thick and so fast that thei knock don
quixot down and if he had been as much of a believ in auguri as he
wa a cathol christian he would have taken it as a bad omen and
declin to buri himself in such a place he got up howev and as
there came no more crow or nightbird like the bat that flew out at
the same time with the crow the cousin and sancho give him rope he
lower himself into the depth of the dread cavern and as he enter
it sancho sent hi bless after him make a thousand cross over
him and sai god and the pea de francia and the triniti of gaeta

came out of the cave as out of a pipe ceas to be heard thei had let
down the hundr fathom of rope thei were inclin to pull don
quixot up again as thei could give him no more rope howev thei
wait about half an hour at the end of which time thei began to

it wa about four in the afternoon when the sun veil in cloud with
subdu light and temper beam enabl don quixot to relat
without heat or inconveni what he had seen in the cave of
montesino to hi two illustri hearer and he began as follow
a matter of some twelv or fourteen time a man height down in thi
pit on the righthand side there is a recess or space roomi enough
to contain a larg cart with it mule a littl light reach it
through some chink or crevic commun with it and open to the
surfac of the earth thi recess or space i perceiv when i wa
alreadi grow weari and disgust at find myself hang suspend
by the rope travel downward into that dark region without ani
certainti or knowledg of where i wa go so i resolv to enter it
and rest myself for a while i call out tell you not to let out
more rope until i bade you but you cannot have heard me i then
gather in the rope you were send me and make a coil or pile of
it i seat myself upon it rumin and consid what i wa to do
to lower myself to the bottom have no on to hold me up and as i
wa thu deep in thought and perplex suddenli and without
provoc a profound sleep fell upon me and when i least expect
it i know not how i awok and found myself in the midst of the most
beauti delight meadow that natur could produc or the most
live human imagin conceiv i open my ey i rub them and
found i wa not asleep but thoroughli awak nevertheless i felt my
head and breast to satisfi myself whether it wa i myself who wa there
or some empti delus phantom but touch feel the collect
thought that pass through my mind all convinc me that i wa the
same then and there that i am thi moment next there present itself
to my sight a state royal palac or castl with wall that seem
built of clear transpar crystal and through two great door that
open wide therein i saw come forth and advanc toward me a
vener old man clad in a long gown of mulberrycolour serg that
trail upon the ground on hi shoulder and breast he had a green
satin collegi hood and cover hi head a black milanes bonnet
and hi snowwhit beard fell below hi girdl he carri no arm
whatev noth but a rosari of bead bigger than fairsiz
filbert each tenth bead be like a moder ostrich egg hi
bear hi gait hi digniti and impos presenc held me spellbound
and wonder he approach me and the first thing he did wa to
embrac me close and then he said to me for a long time now o
valiant knight don quixot of la mancha we who ar here enchant in
these solitud have been hope to see thee that thou mayest make
known to the world what is shut up and conceal in thi deep cave
call the cave of montesino which thou hast enter an achiev
reserv for thy invinc heart and stupend courag alon to
attempt come with me illustri sir and i will show thee the
marvel hidden within thi transpar castl whereof i am the alcaid
and perpetu warden for i am montesino himself from whom the cave
take it name
the instant he told me he wa montesino i ask him if the stori
thei told in the world abov here wa true that he had taken out the
heart of hi great friend durandart from hi breast with a littl
dagger and carri it to the ladi belerma as hi friend when at the
point of death had command him he said in repli that thei spoke the
truth in everi respect except as to the dagger for it wa not a
dagger nor littl but a burnish poniard sharper than an awl
that poniard must have been made by ramon de hoce the sevillian
said sancho
i do not know said don quixot it could not have been by that
poniard maker howev becaus ramon de hoce wa a man of yesterdai
and the affair of roncesval where thi mishap occur wa long
ago but the question is of no great import nor doe it affect or
make ani alter in the truth or substanc of the stori
that is true said the cousin continu seor don quixot for i am
listen to you with the greatest pleasur in the world
and with no less do i tell the tale said don quixot and so to
proceedth vener montesino led me into the palac of crystal
where in a lower chamber strang cool and entir of alabast
wa an elabor wrought marbl tomb upon which i beheld stretch
at full length a knight not of bronz or marbl or jasper as ar
seen on other tomb but of actual flesh and bone hi right hand
which seem to me somewhat hairi and sinewi a sign of great strength
in it owner lai on the side of hi heart but befor i could put ani
question to montesino he see me gaze at the tomb in amaz
said to me thi is my friend durandart flower and mirror of the
true lover and valiant knight of hi time he is held enchant here
as i myself and mani other ar by that french enchant merlin who
thei sai wa the devil son but my belief is not that he wa the
devil son but that he knew as the sai is a point more than the
devil how or why he enchant us no on know but time will tell
and i suspect that time is not far off what i marvel at is that i
know it to be as sure as that it is now dai that durandart end hi
life in my arm and that after hi death i took out hi heart with
my own hand and inde it must have weigh more than two pound
for accord to naturalist he who ha a larg heart is more larg
endow with valour than he who ha a small on then as thi is the
case and as the knight did realli die how come it that he now moan
and sigh from time to time as if he were still aliv

and now there wa heard a great outcri and lament accompani by
deep sigh and bitter sob i look round and through the crystal
wall i saw pass through anoth chamber a process of two line of
fair damsel all clad in mourn and with white turban of turkish
fashion on their head behind in the rear of these there came a
ladi for so from her digniti she seem to be also clad in black
with a white veil so long and ampl that it swept the ground her
turban wa twice as larg as the largest of ani of the other her
eyebrow met her nose wa rather flat her mouth wa larg but with
ruddi lip and her teeth of which at time she allow a glimps
were seen to be spars and illset though as white as peel almond
she carri in her hand a fine cloth and in it as well as i could
make out a heart that had been mummi so parch and dri wa it
montesino told me that all those form the process were the
attend of durandart and belerma who were enchant there with
their master and mistress and that the last she who carri the heart
in the cloth wa the ladi belerma who with her damsel four dai in
the week went in process sing or rather weep dirg over the
bodi and miser heart of hi cousin and that if she appear to me
somewhat illfavour or not so beauti as fame report her it wa
becaus of the bad night and wors dai that she pass in that
enchant as i could see by the great dark circl round her ey
and her sickli complexion her sallow and the ring round her
ey said he ar not caus by the period ailment usual with
women for it is mani month and even year sinc she ha had ani but
by the grief her own heart suffer becaus of that which she hold in
her hand perpetu and which recal and bring back to her memori
the sad fate of her lost lover were it not for thi hardli would the
great dulcinea del toboso so celebr in all these part and even
in the world come up to her for beauti grace and gaieti
hold hard said i at thi tell your stori as you ought seor don
montesino for you know veri well that all comparison ar odiou and
there is no occas to compar on person with anoth the peerless
dulcinea del toboso is what she is and the ladi doa belerma is what
she is and ha been and that enough to which he made answer
forgiv me seor don quixot i own i wa wrong and spoke unadvisedli
in sai that the ladi dulcinea could scarc come up to the ladi
belerma for it were enough for me to have learn by what mean i
know not that you ar her knight to make me bite my tongu out befor
i compar her to anyth save heaven itself after thi apolog
which the great montesino made me my heart recov itself from the
shock i had receiv in hear my ladi compar with belerma
still i wonder said sancho that your worship did not get upon the
old fellow and bruis everi bone of him with kick and pluck hi beard
until you didnt leav a hair in it
nai sancho my friend said don quixot it would not have been
right in me to do that for we ar all bound to pai respect to the
ag even though thei be not knight but especi to those who ar
and who ar enchant i onli know i gave him as good as he brought in
the mani other question and answer we exchang
i cannot understand seor don quixot remark the cousin here
how it is that your worship in such a short space of time as you have
been below there could have seen so mani thing and said and answer
so much
how long is it sinc i went down ask don quixot
littl better than an hour repli sancho
that cannot be return don quixot becaus night overtook me
while i wa there and dai came and it wa night again and dai again
three time so that by my reckon i have been three dai in those
remot region beyond our ken
my master must be right repli sancho for as everyth that ha
happen to him is by enchant mayb what seem to us an hour would
seem three dai and night there
that it said don quixot
and did your worship eat anyth all that time seor ask the
cousin
i never touch a morsel answer don quixot nor did i feel
hunger or think of it
and do the enchant eat said the cousin
thei neither eat said don quixot nor ar thei subject to the
greater excrement though it is thought that their nail beard and
hair grow
and do the enchant sleep now seor ask sancho
certainli not repli don quixot at least dure those three
dai i wa with them not on of them close an ey nor did i either
the proverb tell me what compani thou keepest and ill tell thee
what thou art is to the point here said sancho your worship keep
compani with enchant peopl that ar alwai fast and watch
what wonder is it then that you neither eat nor sleep while you ar
with them but forgiv me seor if i sai that of all thi you have
told us now mai god take mei wa just go to sai the devilif i
believ a singl particl
what said the cousin ha seor don quixot then been ly why
even if he wish it he ha not had time to imagin and put togeth
such a host of li
i dont believ my master li said sancho
if not what dost thou believ ask don quixot
i believ repli sancho that thi merlin or those enchant who
enchant the whole crew your worship sai you saw and discours with
down there stuf your imagin or your mind with all thi
rigmarol you have been treat us to and all that is still to come
all that might be sancho repli don quixot but it is not so
for everyth that i have told you i saw with my own ey and touch
with my own hand but what will you sai when i tell you now how among
the countless other marvel thing montesino show me of which at
leisur and at the proper time i will give thee an account in the
cours of our journei for thei would not be all in place here he
show me three countri girl who went skip and caper like goat
over the pleasant field there and the instant i beheld them i knew
on to be the peerless dulcinea del toboso and the other two those
same countri girl that were with her and that we spoke to on the road
from el toboso i ask montesino if he knew them and he told me he
did not but he thought thei must be some enchant ladi of
distinct for it wa onli a few dai befor that thei had made their
appear in those meadow but i wa not to be surpris at that
becaus there were a great mani other ladi there of time past and
present enchant in variou strang shape and among them he had
recognis queen guinever and her dame quintaona she who pour out
the wine for lancelot when he came from britain
when sancho panza heard hi master sai thi he wa readi to take leav
of hi sens or die with laughter for as he knew the real truth
about the pretend enchant of dulcinea in which he himself had
been the enchant and concoct of all the evid he made up hi
mind at last that beyond all doubt hi master wa out of hi wit and
stark mad so he said to him it wa an evil hour a wors season and
a sorrow dai when your worship dear master mine went down to the
other world and an unlucki moment when you met with seor montesino
who ha sent you back to us like thi you were well enough here abov
in your full sens such as god had given you deliv maxim and
give advic at everi turn and not as you ar now talk the
greatest nonsens that can be imagin
as i know thee sancho said don quixot i heed not thy word
nor i your worship said sancho whether you beat me or kill me
for those i have spoken and will speak if you dont correct and mend
your own but tell me while we ar still at peac how or by what did
you recognis the ladi our mistress and if you spoke to her what did
you sai and what did she answer
i recognis her said don quixot by her wear the same garment
she wore when thou didst point her out to me i spoke to her but she
did not utter a word in repli on the contrari she turn her back on
me and took to flight at such a pace that crossbow bolt could not have
overtaken her i wish to follow her and would have done so had not
montesino recommend me not to take the troubl as it would be
useless particularli as the time wa draw near when it would be
necessari for me to quit the cavern he told me moreov that in
cours of time he would let me know how he and belerma and durandart
and all who were there were to be disench but of all i saw and
observ down there what gave me most pain wa that while montesino
wa speak to me on of the two companion of the hapless dulcinea
approach me on on without my have seen her come and with tear
in her ey said to me in a low agit voic my ladi dulcinea del
toboso kiss your worship hand and entreat you to do her the
favour of let her know how you ar and be in great need she
also entreat your worship as earnestli as she can to be so good as to
lend her half a dozen real or as much as you mai have about you on
thi new dimiti petticoat that i have here and she promis to repai
them veri speedili i wa amaz and taken aback by such a messag
and turn to seor montesino i ask him is it possibl seor
montesino that person of distinct under enchant can be in
need to which he repli believ me seor don quixot that which
is call need is to be met with everywher and penetr all
quarter and reach everyon and doe not spare even the enchant
and as the ladi dulcinea del toboso send to beg those six real and
the pledg is to all appear a good on there is noth for it but
to give them to her for no doubt she must be in some great strait i
will take no pledg of her i repli nor yet can i give her what
she ask for all i have is four real which i gave thei were those
which thou sancho gavest me the other dai to bestow in alm upon the
poor i met along the road and i said tell your mistress my dear
that i am griev to the heart becaus of her distress and wish i
wa a fucar to remedi them and that i would have her know that i
cannot be and ought not be in health while depriv of the happi
of see her and enjoi her discreet convers and that i
implor her as earnestli as i can to allow herself to be seen and
address by thi her captiv servant and forlorn knight tell her
too that when she least expect it she will hear it announc that i
have made an oath and vow after the fashion of that which the marqui
of mantua made to aveng hi nephew baldwin when he found him at the
point of death in the heart of the mountain which wa not to eat
bread off a tablecloth and other trifl matter which he ad
until he had aveng him and i will make the same to take no rest and
to roam the seven region of the earth more thoroughli than the infant
don pedro of portug ever roam them until i have disench her
all that and more you ow my ladi the damsel answer to me and
take the four real instead of make me a curtsei she cut a caper
spring two full yard into the air
o bless god exclaim sancho aloud at thi is it possibl that
such thing can be in the world and that enchant and enchant
can have such power in it as to have chang my master right sens
into a craze so full of absurd o seor seor for god sake
consid yourself have a care for your honour and give no credit to
thi silli stuff that ha left you scant and short of wit
thou talkest in thi wai becaus thou lovest me sancho said don
quixot and not be experienc in the thing of the world
everyth that ha some difficulti about it seem to thee imposs
but time will pass as i said befor and i will tell thee some of the
thing i saw down there which will make thee believ what i have

he who translat thi great histori from the origin written by it
first author cide hamet beneng sai that on come to the chapter
give the adventur of the cave of montesino he found written on the
margin of it in hamet own hand these exact word
i cannot convinc or persuad myself that everyth that is written
in the preced chapter could have precis happen to the valiant
don quixot and for thi reason that all the adventur that have
occur up to the present have been possibl and probabl but as for
thi on of the cave i see no wai of accept it as true as it
pass all reason bound for me to believ that don quixot could
lie he be the most truth gentleman and the noblest knight of hi
time is imposs he would not have told a lie though he were shot
to death with arrow on the other hand i reflect that he relat and
told the stori with all the circumst detail and that he could
not in so short a space have fabric such a vast complic of
absurd if then thi adventur seem apocryph it is no fault
of mine and so without affirm it falsehood or it truth i write
it down decid for thyself in thy wisdom reader for i am not bound
nor is it in my power to do more though certain it is thei sai that
at the time of hi death he retract and said he had invent it
think it match and talli with the adventur he had read of in
hi histori and then he goe on to sai
the cousin wa amaz as well at sancho bold as at the patienc
of hi master and conclud that the good temper the latter displai
aros from the happi he felt at have seen hi ladi dulcinea even
enchant as she wa becaus otherwis the word and languag sancho
had address to him deserv a thrash for inde he seem to him
to have been rather impud to hi master to whom he now observ
i seor don quixot of la mancha look upon the time i have spent in
travel with your worship as veri well emploi for i have gain
four thing in the cours of it the first is that i have made your
acquaint which i consid great good fortun the second that i
have learn what the cave of montesino contain togeth with the
transform of guadiana and of the lake of ruidera which will be
of us to me for the spanish ovid that i have in hand the third to
have discov the antiqu of card that thei were in us at least
in the time of charlemagn as mai be infer from the word you sai
durandart utter when at the end of that long spell while montesino
wa talk to him he woke up and said patienc and shuffl thi
phrase and express he could not have learn while he wa enchant
but onli befor he had becom so in franc and in the time of the
aforesaid emperor charlemagn and thi demonstr is just the thing
for me for that other book i am write the supplement to polydor
vergil on the invent of antiqu for i believ he never thought
of insert that of card in hi book as i mean to do in mine and it
will be a matter of great import particularli when i can cite so
grave and veraci an author as seor durandart and the fourth
thing is that i have ascertain the sourc of the river guadiana
heretofor unknown to mankind
you ar right said don quixot but i should like to know if by
god favour thei grant you a licenc to print those book of
yourswhich i doubtto whom do you mean to dedic them
there ar lord and grande in spain to whom thei can be dedic
said the cousin
not mani said don quixot not that thei ar unworthi of it but
becaus thei do not care to accept book and incur the oblig of
make the return that seem due to the author labour and courtesi
on princ i know who make up for all the rest and morehow much
more if i ventur to sai perhap i should stir up envi in mani a
nobl breast but let thi stand over for some more conveni time
and let us go and look for some place to shelter ourselv in
tonight
not far from thi said the cousin there is a hermitag where
there live a hermit who thei sai wa a soldier and who ha the
reput of be a good christian and a veri intellig and
charit man close to the hermitag he ha a small hous which he
built at hi own cost but though small it is larg enough for the
recept of guest
ha thi hermit ani hen do you think ask sancho
few hermit ar without them said don quixot for those we see
nowadai ar not like the hermit of the egyptian desert who were
clad in palmleav and live on the root of the earth but do not
think that by prais these i am disparag the other all i mean to
sai is that the penanc of those of the present dai do not come up to
the ascetic and auster of former time but it doe not follow
from thi that thei ar not all worthi at least i think them so and
at the worst the hypocrit who pretend to be good doe less harm than
the open sinner
at thi point thei saw approach the spot where thei stood a man on
foot proceed at a rapid pace and beat a mule load with lanc
and halberd when he came up to them he salut them and pass on
without stop don quixot call to him stai good fellow you
seem to be make more hast than suit that mule
i cannot stop seor answer the man for the arm you see i carri
here ar to be us tomorrow so i must not delai god be with you
but if you want to know what i am carri them for i mean to lodg
tonight at the inn that is beyond the hermitag and if you be go
the same road you will find me there and i will tell you some curiou
thing onc more god be with you and he urg on hi mule at such a
pace that don quixot had no time to ask him what these curiou thing
were that he meant to tell them and as he wa somewhat inquisit
and alwai tortur by hi anxieti to learn someth new he decid
to set out at onc and go and pass the night at the inn instead of
stop at the hermitag where the cousin would have had them halt
accordingli thei mount and all three took the direct road for the
inn which thei reach a littl befor nightfal on the road the
cousin propos thei should go up to the hermitag to drink a sup the
instant sancho heard thi he steer hi dappl toward it and don
quixot and the cousin did the same but it seem sancho bad luck so
order it that the hermit wa not at home for so a subhermit thei
found in the hermitag told them thei call for some of the best she
repli that her master had none but that if thei like cheap water
she would give it with great pleasur
if i found ani in water said sancho there ar well along the road
where i could have had enough of it ah camacho wed and
plenti hous of don diego how often do i miss you
leav the hermitag thei push on toward the inn and a littl
farther thei came upon a youth who wa pace along in front of them at
no great speed so that thei overtook him he carri a sword over hi
shoulder and slung on it a budget or bundl of hi cloth appar
probabl hi breech or pantaloon and hi cloak and a shirt or two
for he had on a short jacket of velvet with a gloss like satin on it in
place and had hi shirt out hi stock were of silk and hi
shoe squareto as thei wear them at court hi ag might have been
eighteen or nineteen he wa of a merri counten and to all
appear of an activ habit and he went along sing seguidilla to
beguil the wearisom of the road as thei came up with him he wa
just finish on which the cousin got by heart and thei sai ran
thu
im off to the war
for the want of penc
oh had i but monei
id show more sens
the first to address him wa don quixot who said you travel veri
airili sir gallant whither bound mai we ask if it is your pleasur
to tell us
to which the youth repli the heat and my poverti ar the reason of
my travel so airili and it is to the war that i am bound
how poverti ask don quixot the heat on can understand
seor repli the youth in thi bundl i carri velvet pantaloon
to match thi jacket if i wear them out on the road i shall not be
abl to make a decent appear in them in the citi and i have not
the wherewith to bui other and so for thi reason as well as to
keep myself cool i am make my wai in thi fashion to overtak some
compani of infantri that ar not twelv leagu off in which i shall
enlist and there will be no want of baggag train to travel with
after that to the place of embark which thei sai will be
carthagena i would rather have the king for a master and serv him in
the war than serv a court pauper
and did you get ani bounti now ask the cousin
if i had been in the servic of some grande of spain or personag of
distinct repli the youth i should have been safe to get it
for that is the advantag of serv good master that out of the
servant hall men come to be ancient or captain or get a good
pension but i to my misfortun alwai serv placehunt and
adventur whose keep and wage were so miser and scanti that
half went in pai for the starch of on collar it would be a
miracl inde if a page volunt ever got anyth like a reason
bounti
and tell me for heaven sake ask don quixot is it possibl
my friend that all the time you serv you never got ani liveri
thei gave me two repli the page but just as when on quit a
religi commun befor make profess thei strip him of the
dress of the order and give him back hi own cloth so did my master
return me mine for as soon as the busi on which thei came to court
wa finish thei went home and took back the liveri thei had given
mere for show
what spilorceriaa an italian would sai said don quixot but for
all that consid yourself happi in have left court with as worthi
an object as you have for there is noth on earth more honour or
profit than serv first of all god and then on king and
natur lord particularli in the profess of arm by which if not
more wealth at least more honour is to be won than by letter as i
have said mani a time for though letter mai have found more great
hous than arm still those found by arm have i know not what
superior over those found by letter and a certain splendour
belong to them that distinguish them abov all and bear in mind
what i am now about to sai to you for it will be of great us and
comfort to you in time of troubl it is not to let your mind dwell on
the advers chanc that mai befal you for the worst of all is death
and if it be a good death the best of all is to die thei ask juliu
csar the valiant roman emperor what wa the best death he answer
that which is unexpect which come suddenli and unforeseen and
though he answer like a pagan and on without the knowledg of the
true god yet as far as spare our feel is concern he wa
right for suppos you ar kill in the first engag or skirmish
whether by a cannon ball or blown up by mine what matter it it is
onli dy and all is over and accord to terenc a soldier show
better dead in battl than aliv and safe in flight and the good
soldier win fame in proport as he is obedi to hi captain and
those in command over him and rememb my son that it is better for
the soldier to smell of gunpowd than of civet and that if old ag
should come upon you in thi honour call though you mai be
cover with wound and crippl and lame it will not come upon you
without honour and that such as poverti cannot lessen especi now
that provis ar be made for support and reliev old and
disabl soldier for it is not right to deal with them after the
fashion of those who set free and get rid of their black slave when
thei ar old and useless and turn them out of their hous under
the pretenc of make them free make them slave to hunger from
which thei cannot expect to be releas except by death but for the
present i wont sai more than get ye up behind me on my hors as far as
the inn and sup with me there and tomorrow you shall pursu your
journei and god give you as good speed as your intent deserv
the page did not accept the invit to mount though he did that to
supper at the inn and here thei sai sancho said to himself god be
with you for a master is it possibl that a man who can sai thing so
mani and so good as he ha said just now can sai that he saw the
imposs absurd he report about the cave of montesino well
well we shall see
and now just as night wa fall thei reach the inn and it wa
not without satisfact that sancho perceiv hi master took it for a
real inn and not for a castl as usual the instant thei enter don
quixot ask the landlord after the man with the lanc and halberd
and wa told that he wa in the stabl see to hi mule which wa
what sancho and the cousin proceed to do for their beast give the
best manger and the best place in the stabl to rocinant

don quixot bread would not bake as the common sai is until he
had heard and learn the curiou thing promis by the man who

and so he did sift the barlei for him and clean out the manger
a degre of humil which made the other feel bound to tell him with a
good grace what he had ask so seat himself on a bench with don
quixot besid him and the cousin the page sancho panza and the
landlord for a senat and an audienc he began hi stori in thi wai
you must know that in a villag four leagu and a half from thi inn
it so happen that on of the regidor by the trick and rogueri of a
servant girl of hi it too long a tale to tell lost an ass and
though he did all he possibl could to find it it wa all to no
purpos a fortnight might have gone by so the stori goe sinc the
ass had been miss when as the regidor who had lost it wa stand
in the plaza anoth regidor of the same town said to him pai me for
good new gossip your ass ha turn up that i will and well
gossip said the other but tell us where ha he turn up in the
forest said the finder i saw him thi morn without packsaddl
or har of ani sort and so lean that it went to on heart to see
him i tri to drive him befor me and bring him to you but he is
alreadi so wild and shy that when i went near him he made off into the
thickest part of the forest if you have a mind that we two should go
back and look for him let me put up thi sheass at my hous and ill
be back at onc you will be do me a great kind said the
owner of the ass and ill try to pai it back in the same coin it is
with all these circumst and in the veri same wai i am tell it
now that those who know all about the matter tell the stori well
then the two regidor set off on foot arm in arm for the forest and
come to the place where thei hope to find the ass thei could not
find him nor wa he to be seen anywher about search as thei might
see then that there wa no sign of him the regidor who had seen
him said to the other look here gossip a plan ha occur to me
by which beyond a doubt we shall manag to discov the anim even
if he is stow awai in the bowel of the earth not to sai the forest
here it is i can brai to perfect and if you can ever so littl
the thing as good as done ever so littl did you sai gossip
said the other by god ill not give in to anybodi not even to the
ass themselv well soon see said the second regidor for my
plan is that you should go on side of the forest and i the other so
as to go all round about it and everi now and then you will brai and i
will brai and it cannot be but that the ass will hear us and answer
us if he is in the forest to which the owner of the ass repli
it an excel plan i declar gossip and worthi of your great
geniu and the two separ as agre it so fell out that thei
brai almost at the same moment and each deceiv by the brai of
the other ran to look fanci the ass had turn up at last when
thei came in sight of on anoth said the loser is it possibl
gossip that it wa not my ass that brai no it wa i said the
other well then i can tell you gossip said the asss owner that
between you and an ass there is not an atom of differ as far as
brai goe for i never in all my life saw or heard anyth more
natur those prais and compliment belong to you more justli than
to me gossip said the inventor of the plan for by the god that
made me you might give a coupl of brai odd to the best and most
finish brayer in the world the tone you have got is deep your voic
is well kept up as to time and pitch and your finish note come
thick and fast in fact i own myself beaten and yield the palm to
you and give in to you in thi rare accomplish well then said
the owner ill set a higher valu on myself for the futur and
consid that i know someth as i have an excel of some sort
for though i alwai thought i brai well i never suppos i came up
to the pitch of perfect you sai and i sai too said the second
that there ar rare gift go to loss in the world and that thei
ar ill bestow upon those who dont know how to make us of them
our said the owner of the ass unless it is in case like thi we
have now in hand cannot be of ani servic to us and even in thi god
grant thei mai be of some us so sai thei separ and took to
their brai onc more but everi instant thei were deceiv on
anoth and come to meet on anoth again until thei arrang by
wai of countersign so as to know that it wa thei and not the ass to
give two brai on after the other in thi wai doubl the brai at
everi step thei made the complet circuit of the forest but the lost
ass never gave them an answer or even the sign of on how could the
poor illstar brute have answer when in the thickest part of the
forest thei found him devour by wolv as soon as he saw him hi
owner said i wa wonder he did not answer for if he wasnt dead
hed have brai when he heard us or hed have been no ass but for
the sake of have heard you brai to such perfect gossip i count
the troubl i have taken to look for him well bestow even though i
have found him dead it in a good hand gossip said the other
if the abbot sing well the acolyt is not much behind him so thei
return disconsol and hoars to their villag where thei told
their friend neighbour and acquaint what had befallen them in
their search for the ass each cry up the other perfect in
brai the whole stori came to be known and spread abroad through the
villag of the neighbourhood and the devil who never sleep with
hi love for sow dissens and scatter discord everywher
blow mischief about and make quarrel out of noth contriv to
make the peopl of the other town fall to brai whenev thei saw
anyon from our villag as if to throw the brai of our regidor in
our teeth then the boi took to it which wa the same thing for it as
get into the hand and mouth of all the devil of hell and
brai spread from on town to anoth in such a wai that the men of
the brai town ar as easi to be known as black ar to be known from
white and the unlucki joke ha gone so far that sever time the
scof have come out in arm and in a bodi to do battl with the
scoffer and neither king nor rook fear nor shame can mend matter
tomorrow or the dai after i believ the men of my town that is of
the brai town ar go to take the field against anoth villag
two leagu awai from our on of those that persecut us most and
that we mai turn out well prepar i have bought these lanc and
halberd you have seen these ar the curiou thing i told you i had
to tell and if you dont think them so i have got no other and
with thi the worthi fellow brought hi stori to a close
just at thi moment there came in at the gate of the inn a man entir
clad in chamoi leather hose breech and doublet who said in a
loud voic seor host have you room here the divin ap and the
show of the releas of melisendra just come
od bodi said the landlord why it master pedro were in for a
grand night i forgot to mention that the said master pedro had hi
left ey and nearli half hi cheek cover with a patch of green

welcom master pedro continu the landlord but where ar the ap
and the show for i dont see them thei ar close at hand said he

room id make the duke of alva himself clear out to make room for
master pedro said the landlord bring in the ap and the show
there compani in the inn tonight that will pai to see that and the
clever of the ap so be it by all mean said the man with the
patch ill lower the price and be well satisfi if i onli pai my
expens and now ill go back and hurri on the cart with the ap and
the show and with thi he went out of the inn
don quixot at onc ask the landlord what thi master pedro wa and
what wa the show and what wa the ap he had with him which the
landlord repli thi is a famou puppetshowman who for some time
past ha been go about thi mancha de aragon exhibit a show of

and bestrepres stori that have been seen in thi part of the
kingdom for mani a year he ha also with him an ap with the most
extraordinari gift ever seen in an ap or imagin in a human be
for if you ask him anyth he listen attent to the question
and then jump on hi master shoulder and press close to hi ear
tell him the answer which master pedro then deliv he sai a great
deal more about thing past than about thing to come and though he

wrong so that he make us fanci he ha got the devil in him he get
two real for everi question if the ap answer i mean if hi master

believ that thi same master pedro is veri rich he is a gallant
man as thei sai in itali and good compani and lead the finest life
in the world talk more than six drink more than a dozen and all by
hi tongu and hi ap and hi show
master pedro now came back and in a cart follow the show and the

don quixot wa thunderstruck sancho astound the cousin stagger
the page astonish the man from the brai town agap the landlord
in perplex and in short everyon amaz at the word of the
puppetshowman who went on to sai and thou worthi sancho panza the
best squir and squir to the best knight in the world be of good
cheer for thy good wife teresa is well and she is at thi moment
hackl a pound of flax and more by token she ha at her left hand a
jug with a broken spout that hold a good drop of wine with which she
solac herself at her work
that i can well believ said sancho she is a lucki on and if it
wa not for her jealousi i would not chang her for the giantess
andandona who by my master account wa a veri clever and worthi
woman my teresa is on of those that wont let themselv want for
anyth though their heir mai have to pai for it
now i declar said don quixot he who read much and travel much
see and know a great deal i sai so becaus what amount of persuas
could have persuad me that there ar ap in the world that can
divin as i have seen now with my own ey for i am that veri don
quixot of la mancha thi worthi anim refer to though he ha gone
rather too far in my prais but whatev i mai be i thank heaven that
it ha endow me with a tender and compassion heart alwai
dispos to do good to all and harm to none
if i had monei said the page i would ask seor ap what will
happen to me in the peregrin i am make
to thi master pedro who had by thi time risen from don quixot
feet repli i have alreadi said that thi littl beast give no
answer as to the futur but if he did not have monei would be of no
consequ for to oblig seor don quixot here present i would
give up all the profit in the world and now becaus i have promis
it and to afford him pleasur i will set up my show and offer
entertain to all who ar in the inn without ani charg whatev
as soon as he heard thi the landlord delight beyond measur
point out a place where the show might be fix which wa done at
onc
don quixot wa not veri well satisfi with the divin of the
ap as he did not think it proper that an ap should divin anyth
either past or futur so while master pedro wa arrang the show he
retir with sancho into a corner of the stabl where without be
overheard by anyon he said to him look here sancho i have been
serious think over thi ap extraordinari gift and have come to
the conclus that beyond doubt thi master pedro hi master ha a
pact tacit or express with the devil
if the packet is express from the devil said sancho it must be a
veri dirti packet no doubt but what good can it do master pedro to
have such packet
thou dost not understand me sancho said don quixot i onli mean
he must have made some compact with the devil to infus thi power into
the ap that he mai get hi live and after he ha grown rich he
will give him hi soul which is what the enemi of mankind want thi
i am led to believ by observ that the ap onli answer about thing
past or present and the devil knowledg extend no further for the
futur he know onli by guesswork and that not alwai for it is
reserv for god alon to know the time and the season and for him
there is neither past nor futur all is present thi be as it is
it is clear that thi ap speak by the spirit of the devil and i am
astonish thei have not denounc him to the holi offic and put him
to the question and forc it out of him by whose virtu it is that he
divin becaus it is certain thi ap is not an astrolog neither
hi master nor he set up or know how to set up those figur thei
call judiciari which ar now so common in spain that there is not a
jade or page or old cobbler that will not undertak to set up a
figur as readili as pick up a knave of card from the ground bring
to nought the marvel truth of the scienc by their li and
ignor i know of a ladi who ask on of these figur schemer
whether her littl lapdog would be in pup and would breed and how
mani and of what colour the littl pup would be to which seor
astrolog after have set up hi figur made answer that the bitch
would be in pup and would drop three pup on green anoth bright
red and the third particolour provid she conceiv between
eleven and twelv either of the dai or night and on a mondai or
saturdai but as thing turn out two dai after thi the bitch di
of a surfeit and seor planetrul had the credit all over the place
of be a most profound astrolog as most of these planetrul
have
still said sancho i would be glad if your worship would make
master pedro ask hi ap whether what happen your worship in the cave
of montesino is true for beg your worship pardon i for my
part take it to have been all flam and li or at ani rate someth
you dreamt
that mai be repli don quixot howev i will do what you
suggest though i have my own scrupl about it
at thi point master pedro came up in quest of don quixot to tell him

began to shower down blow on the puppet troop of moor knock over
some decapit other maim thi on and demolish that and
among mani more he deliv on down stroke which if master pedro had

hard groundwhat scatter and shatter them but the invinc
strength of that mighti arm and whose were the bodi thei belong to

time befor believ that the enchant who persecut me do noth
more than put figur like these befor my ey and then chang and

i am will to condemn myself in cost for thi error of mine though
it did not proce from malic let master pedro see what he want for

monei of castil
master pedro made him a bow sai i expect no less of the rare
christian of the valiant don quixot of la mancha true helper and
protector of all destitut and needi vagabond master landlord here
and the great sancho panza shall be the arbitr and apprais
between your worship and me of what these dilapid figur ar worth
or mai be worth
the landlord and sancho consent and then master pedro pick up from
the ground king marsilio of saragossa with hi head off and said
here you see how imposs it is to restor thi king to hi former
state so i think save your better judgment that for hi death
deceas and demis four real and a half mai be given me
proce said don quixot
well then for thi cleavag from top to bottom continu master
pedro take up the split emperor charlemagn it would not be much
if i were to ask five real and a quarter
it not littl said sancho
nor is it much said the landlord make it even and sai five
real
let him have the whole five and a quarter said don quixot for the
sum total of thi notabl disast doe not stand on a quarter more or
less and make an end of it quickli master pedro for it get on
to suppertim and i have some hint of hunger
for thi figur said master pedro that is without a nose and
want an ey and is the fair melisendra i ask and i am reason in
my charg two real and twelv maravedi
the veri devil must be in it said don quixot if melisendra and
her husband ar not by thi time at least on the french border for the
hors thei rode on seem to me to fly rather than gallop so you
neednt try to sell me the cat for the hare show me here a noseless
melisendra when she is now mai be enjoi herself at her eas with
her husband in franc god help everi on to hi own master pedro and
let us all proce fairli and honestli and now go on
master pedro perceiv that don quixot wa begin to wander and
return to hi origin fanci wa not dispos to let him escap so he
said to him thi cannot be melisendra but must be on of the damsel
that wait on her so if im given sixti maravedi for her ill be
content and suffici paid

melisandra and seor don gaifero were now in franc and with their own
peopl
no on could tell us that better than my ap said master pedro but
there no devil that could catch him now i suspect howev that

good fellowship at don quixot expens for he wa the height of

cide hamet the chronicl of thi great histori begin thi chapter

a cathol christian take an oath swear or ought to swear what is
true and tell the truth in what he aver so he wa tell the truth
as much as if he swore as a cathol christian in all he chose to
write about quixot especi in declar who master pedro wa and
what wa the divin ap that astonish all the villag with hi
divin he sai then that he who ha read the first part of thi
histori will rememb well enough the gine de pasamont whom with
other gallei slave don quixot set free in the sierra morena a
kind for which he afterward got poor thank and wors payment from
that evilmind illcondit set thi gine de pasamontedon
ginesillo de parapilla don quixot call himit wa that stole dappl
from sancho panza which becaus by the fault of the printer neither
the how nor the when wa state in the first part ha been a puzzl to
a good mani peopl who attribut to the bad memori of the author what
wa the error of the press in fact howev gine stole him while
sancho panza wa asleep on hi back adopt the plan and devic that
brunello had recours to when he stole sacripant hors from between
hi leg at the sieg of albracca and as ha been told sancho
afterward recov him thi gine then afraid of be caught by
the offic of justic who were look for him to punish him for hi
numberless rascal and offenc which were so mani and so great
that he himself wrote a big book give an account of them resolv
to shift hi quarter into the kingdom of aragon and cover up hi left
ey and take up the trade of a puppetshowman for thi as well as
juggl he knew how to practis to perfect from some releas
christian return from barbari it so happen he bought the ap
which he taught to mount upon hi shoulder on hi make a certain
sign and to whisper or seem to do so in hi ear thu prepar
befor enter ani villag whither he wa bound with hi show and hi
ap he us to inform himself at the nearest villag or from the most
like person he could find as to what particular thing had happen
there and to whom and bear them well in mind the first thing he
did wa to exhibit hi show sometim on stori sometim anoth
but all live amus and familiar as soon as the exhibit wa
over he brought forward the accomplish of hi ap assur the
public that he divin all the past and the present but as to the
futur he had no skill for each question answer he ask two real
and for some he made a reduct just as he happen to feel the puls
of the question and when now and then he came to hous where
thing that he knew of had happen to the peopl live there even if
thei did not ask him a question not care to pai for it he would
make the sign to the ap and then declar that it had said so and so
which fit the case exactli in thi wai he acquir a prodigi
name and all ran after him on other occas be veri crafti he
would answer in such a wai that the answer suit the question and
as no on crossquest him or press him to tell how hi ap
divin he made fool of them all and fill hi pouch the instant he
enter the inn he knew don quixot and sancho and with that knowledg
it wa easi for him to astonish them and all who were there but it
would have cost him dear had don quixot brought down hi hand a littl
lower when he cut off king marsilio head and destroi all hi
horsemen as relat in the preceed chapter
so much for master pedro and hi ap and now to return to don quixot
of la mancha after he had left the inn he determin to visit first
of all the bank of the ebro and that neighbourhood befor enter
the citi of saragossa for the ampl time there wa still to spare
befor the joust left him enough for all with thi object in view he
follow the road and travel along it for two dai without meet
ani adventur worth commit to write until on the third dai as he
wa ascend a hill he heard a great nois of drum trumpet and
musketshot at first he imagin some regiment of soldier wa
pass that wai and to see them he spur rocinant and mount the
hill on reach the top he saw at the foot of it over two hundr
men as it seem to him arm with weapon of variou sort lanc
crossbow partisan halberd and pike and a few musket and a
great mani buckler he descend the slope and approach the band
near enough to see distinctli the flag make out the colour and
distinguish the devic thei bore especi on on a standard or
ensign of white satin on which there wa paint in a veri lifelik
style an ass like a littl sard with it head up it mouth open and
it tongu out as if it were in the act and attitud of brai and
round it were inscrib in larg charact these two line
thei did not brai in vain
our alcald twain
from thi devic don quixot conclud that these peopl must be from
the brai town and he said so to sancho explain to him what wa
written on the standard at the same time be observ that the man who
had told them about the matter wa wrong in sai that the two who
brai were regidor for accord to the line of the standard thei
were alcald to which sancho repli seor there noth to
stick at in that for mayb the regidor who brai then came to be
alcald of their town afterward and so thei mai go by both titl
moreov it ha noth to do with the truth of the stori whether the
brayer were alcald or regidor provid at ani rate thei did brai
for an alcald is just as like to brai as a regidor thei perceiv
in short clearli that the town which had been twit had turn out
to do battl with some other that had jeer it more than wa fair or
neighbourli
don quixot proceed to join them not a littl to sancho
uneasi for he never relish mix himself up in expedit of
that sort the member of the troop receiv him into the midst of
them take him to be someon who wa on their side don quixot
put up hi visor advanc with an easi bear and demeanour to
the standard with the ass and all the chief men of the armi gather
round him to look at him stare at him with the usual amaz that
everybodi felt on see him for the first time don quixot see

or put ani question to him determin to take advantag of their
silenc so break hi own he lift up hi voic and said worthi

with thi permiss don quixot went on to sai i sir am a
knighterr whose call is that of arm and whose profess is to
protect those who requir protect and give help to such as stand in
need of it some dai ago i becam acquaint with your misfortun and
the caus which impel you to take up arm again and again to reveng
yourselv upon your enemi and have mani time thought over your
busi in my mind i find that accord to the law of combat you
ar mistaken in hold yourselv insult for a privat individu
cannot insult an entir commun unless it be by defi it
collect as a traitor becaus he cannot tell who in particular is
guilti of the treason for which he defi it of thi we have an
exampl in don diego ordoez de lara who defi the whole town of
zamora becaus he did not know that vellido dolfo alon had commit
the treacheri of slai hi king and therefor he defi them all
and the vengeanc and the repli concern all though to be sure
seor don diego went rather too far inde veri much beyond the limit
of a defianc for he had no occas to defi the dead or the water
or the fish or those yet unborn and all the rest of it as set
forth but let that pass for when anger break out there no father
governor or bridl to check the tongu the case be then that no
on person can insult a kingdom provinc citi state or entir
commun it is clear there is no reason for go out to aveng the
defianc of such an insult inasmuch as it is not on a fine thing it
would be if the peopl of the clock town were to be at loggerhead
everi moment with everyon who call them by that nameor the
cazolero berengenero ballenato jabonero or the bearer of all
the other name and titl that ar alwai in the mouth of the boi and
common peopl it would be a nice busi inde if all these
illustri citi were to take huff and reveng themselv and go
about perpetu make trombon of their sword in everi petti
quarrel no no god forbid there ar four thing for which sensibl
men and wellord state ought to take up arm draw their sword
and risk their person live and properti the first is to defend
the cathol faith the second to defend on life which is in
accord with natur and divin law the third in defenc of on
honour famili and properti the fourth in the servic of on king
in a just war and if to these we choos to add a fifth which mai be
includ in the second in defenc of on countri to these five as
it were capit caus there mai be ad some other that mai be just
and reason and make it a duti to take up arm but to take them up
for trifl and thing to laugh at and be amus by rather than
offend look as though he who did so wa altogeth want in
common sens moreov to take an unjust reveng and there cannot be
ani just on is directli oppos to the sacr law that we
acknowledg wherein we ar command to do good to our enemi and to
love them that hate us a command which though it seem somewhat
difficult to obei is onli so to those who have in them less of god
than of the world and more of the flesh than of the spirit for jesu
christ god and true man who never li and could not and cannot lie
said as our lawgiv that hi yoke wa easi and hi burden light he
would not therefor have laid ani command upon us that it wa
imposs to obei thu sir you ar bound to keep quiet by human
and divin law
the devil take me said sancho to himself at thi but thi master
of mine is a theologian or if not faith he as like on as on egg
is like anoth
don quixot stop to take breath and observ that silenc wa
still preserv had a mind to continu hi discours and would have
done so had not sancho interpos with hi smart for he see
hi master paus took the lead sai my lord don quixot of la
mancha who onc wa call the knight of the rueful counten but
now is call the knight of the lion is a gentleman of great
discret who know latin and hi mother tongu like a bachelor and
in everyth that he deal with or advis proce like a good
soldier and ha all the law and ordin of what thei call combat
at hi finger end so you have noth to do but to let yourselv
be guid by what he sai and on my head be it if it is wrong besid
which you have been told that it is folli to take offenc at mere
hear a brai i rememb when i wa a boi i brai as often as i had
a fanci without anyon hinder me and so elegantli and natur
that when i brai all the ass in the town would brai but i wa none
the less for that the son of my parent who were greatli respect and
though i wa envi becaus of the gift by more than on of the high
and mighti on of the town i did not care two farth for it and
that you mai see i am tell the truth wait a bit and listen for
thi art like swim onc learnt is never forgotten and then
take hold of hi nose he began to brai so vigor that all the
vallei around rang again
on of those howev that stood near him fanci he wa mock
them lift up a long staff he had in hi hand and smote him such a
blow with it that sancho drop helpless to the ground don quixot
see him so roughli handl attack the man who had struck him
lanc in hand but so mani thrust themselv between them that he could
not aveng him far from it find a shower of stone rain upon
him and crossbow and musket unnumb level at him he wheel
rocinant round and as fast as hi best gallop could take him fled
from the midst of them commend himself to god with all hi heart to

thee know sancho that the valour which is not base upon a foundat
of prudenc is call rash and the exploit of the rash man ar to
be attribut rather to good fortun than to courag and so i own that
i retir but not that i fled and therein i have follow the exampl
of mani valiant men who have reserv themselv for better time the
histori ar full of instanc of thi but as it would not be ani
good to thee or pleasur to me i will not recount them to thee now

groan and on don quixot ask him what caus such acut suffer
he repli that from the end of hi backbon up to the nape of hi
neck he wa so sore that it nearli drove him out of hi sens
the caus of that sore said don quixot will be no doubt
that the staff wherewith thei smote thee be a veri long on it
caught thee all down the back where all the part that ar sore ar
situat and had it reach ani further thou wouldst be sorer still

of the famou adventur of the enchant bark

by stage as alreadi describ or left undescrib two dai after
quit the grove don quixot and sancho reach the river ebro and
the sight of it wa a great delight to don quixot as he contempl
and gaze upon the charm of it bank the clear of it stream
the gentl of it current and the abund of it crystal water
and the pleasant view reviv a thousand tender thought in hi mind
abov all he dwelt upon what he had seen in the cave of montesino
for though master pedro ap had told him that of those thing part
wa true part fals he clung more to their truth than to their
falsehood the veri revers of sancho who held them all to be
downright li
as thei were thu proceed then thei discov a small boat
without oar or ani other gear that lai at the water edg ti to
the stem of a tree grow on the bank don quixot look all round
and see nobodi at onc without more ado dismount from rocinant
and bade sancho get down from dappl and tie both beast secur to
the trunk of a poplar or willow that stood there sancho ask him the
reason of thi sudden dismount and ty don quixot made answer
thou must know sancho that thi bark is plainli and without the
possibl of ani altern call and invit me to enter it
and in it go to give aid to some knight or other person of distinct
in need of it who is no doubt in some sore strait for thi is the wai
of the book of chivalri and of the enchant who figur and speak in
them when a knight is involv in some difficulti from which he cannot
be deliv save by the hand of anoth knight though thei mai be at
a distanc of two or three thousand leagu or more on from the other
thei either take him up on a cloud or thei provid a bark for him to
get into and in less than the twinkl of an ey thei carri him where
thei will and where hi help is requir and so sancho thi bark is
place here for the same purpos thi is as true as that it is now
dai and er thi on pass tie dappl and rocinant togeth and
then in god hand be it to guid us for i would not hold back from
embark though barefoot friar were to beg me
as that the case said sancho and your worship choos to give in
to thesei dont know if i mai call them absurditiesat everi turn
there noth for it but to obei and bow the head bear in mind
the proverb do as thy master bid thee and sit down to tabl with
him but for all that for the sake of eas my conscienc i warn
your worship that it is my opinion thi bark is no enchant on but
belong to some of the fishermen of the river for thei catch the best
shad in the world here
as sancho said thi he ti the beast leav them to the care and
protect of the enchant with sorrow enough in hi heart don
quixot bade him not be uneasi about desert the anim for he who
would carri themselv over such longinqu road and region would
take care to feed them
i dont understand that logiqu said sancho nor have i ever
heard the word all the dai of my life
longinqu repli don quixot mean far off but it is no wonder
thou dost not understand it for thou art not bound to know latin like
some who pretend to know it and dont
now thei ar ti said sancho what ar we to do next
what said don quixot cross ourselv and weigh anchor i mean
embark and cut the moor by which the bark is held and the bark
began to drift awai slowli from the bank but when sancho saw himself
somewher about two yard out in the river he began to trembl and
give himself up for lost but noth distress him more than hear
dappl brai and see rocinant struggl to get loos and said he
to hi master dappl is brai in grief at our leav him and
rocinant is try to escap and plung in after us o dear friend
peac be with you and mai thi mad that is take us awai from
you turn into sober sens bring us back to you and with thi he
fell weep so bitterli that don quixot said to him sharpli and
angrili what art thou afraid of cowardli creatur what art thou
weep at heart of butterpast who pursu or molest thee thou
soul of a tame mous what dost thou want unsatisfi in the veri
heart of abund art thou perchanc tramp barefoot over the
riphaean mountain instead of be seat on a bench like an archduk
on the tranquil stream of thi pleasant river from which in a short
space we shall come out upon the broad sea but we must have alreadi
emerg and gone seven hundr or eight hundr leagu and if i had
here an astrolab to take the altitud of the pole i could tell thee
how mani we have travel though either i know littl or we have
alreadi cross or shall shortli cross the equinocti line which part
the two opposit pole midwai
and when we come to that line your worship speak of said sancho
how far shall we have gone
veri far said don quixot for of the three hundr and sixti
degre that thi terraqu globe contain as comput by ptolemi
the greatest cosmograph known we shall have travel onehalf when
we come to the line i spoke of
by god said sancho your worship give me a nice author for what
you sai putrid dolli someth transmogrifi or whatev it is
don quixot laugh at the interpret sancho put upon comput
and the name of the cosmograph ptolemi and said he thou must know
sancho that with the spaniard and those who embark at cadiz for the
east indi on of the sign thei have to show them when thei have
pass the equinocti line i told thee of is that the lice die upon
everybodi on board the ship and not a singl on is left or to be
found in the whole vessel if thei gave it weight in gold for it so
sancho thou mayest as well pass thy hand down thy thigh and if thou
comest upon anyth aliv we shall be no longer in doubt if not then
we have cross
i dont believ a bit of it said sancho still ill do as your
worship bid me though i dont know what need there is for try
these experi for i can see with my own ey that we have not
move five yard awai from the bank or shift two yard from where
the anim stand for there ar rocinant and dappl in the veri same
place where we left them and watch a point as i do now i swear by
all that good we ar not stir or move at the pace of an ant
try the test i told thee of sancho said don quixot and dont
mind ani other for thou knowest noth about colur line
parallel zodiac eclipt pole solstic equinox planet
sign bear the measur of which the celesti and terrestri
sphere ar compos if thou wert acquaint with all these thing or
ani portion of them thou wouldst see clearli how mani parallel we
have cut what sign we have seen and what constel we have left
behind and ar now leav behind but again i tell thee feel and
hunt for i am certain thou art cleaner than a sheet of smooth white
paper
sancho felt and pass hi hand gentli and carefulli down to the
hollow of hi left knee he look up at hi master and said either
the test is a fals on or we have not come to where your worship
sai nor within mani leagu of it
why how so ask don quixot hast thou come upon aught
ay and aught repli sancho and shake hi finger he wash hi
whole hand in the river along which the boat wa quietli glide in
midstream not move by ani occult intellig or invis enchant
but simpli by the current just there smooth and gentl
thei now came in sight of some larg water mill that stood in the
middl of the river and the instant don quixot saw them he cri out
seest thou there my friend there stand the castl or fortress
where there is no doubt some knight in duranc or illus queen or
infanta or princess in whose aid i am brought hither
what the devil citi fortress or castl is your worship talk
about seor said sancho dont you see that those ar mill that
stand in the river to grind corn
hold thy peac sancho said don quixot though thei look like
mill thei ar not so i have alreadi told thee that enchant
transform thing and chang their proper shape i do not mean to sai
thei realli chang them from on form into anoth but that it seem
as though thei did as experi prove in the transform of
dulcinea sole refug of my hope
by thi time the boat have reach the middl of the stream began
to move less slowli than hitherto the miller belong to the mill
when thei saw the boat come down the river and on the point of be
suck in by the draught of the wheel ran out in hast sever of
them with long pole to stop it and be all meali with face and
garment cover with flour thei present a sinist appear thei
rais loud shout cry devil of men where ar you go to ar
you mad do you want to drown yourselv or dash yourselv to piec

reach the place where i am to show what the might of my arm can do
see what ruffian and villain come out against me see what monster
oppos me see what hideou counten come to frighten us you shall
soon see scoundrel and then stand up in the boat he began in a
loud voic to hurl threat at the miller exclaim illcondit
and worsecounsel rabbl restor to liberti and freedom the person

whatev rank or qualiti he be for i am don quixot of la mancha

of heaven abov it is reserv to give a happi issu to thi
adventur and so sai he drew hi sword and began make pass in
the air at the miller who hear but not understand all thi
nonsens strove to stop the boat which wa now get into the
rush channel of the wheel sancho fell upon hi knee devoutli
appeal to heaven to deliv him from such immin peril which it
did by the activ and quick of the miller who push against
the boat with their pole stop it not howev without upset
and throw don quixot and sancho into the water and lucki it wa
for don quixot that he could swim like a goos though the weight of
hi armour carri him twice to the bottom and had it not been for the
miller who plung in and hoist them both out it would have been
troi town with the pair of them as soon as more drench than
thirsti thei were land sancho went down on hi knee and with
clasp hand and ey rais to heaven prai a long and fervent
prayer to god to deliv him evermor from the rash project and
attempt of hi master the fishermen the owner of the boat which
the millwheel had knock to piec now came up and see it
smash thei proceed to strip sancho and to demand payment for it
from don quixot but he with great calm just as if noth had
happen him told the miller and fishermen that he would pai for the

on provid the bark for me and the other upset me god help us thi

aloud friend whoeer ye be that ar immur in that prison forgiv

sancho went off at top speed forc dappl out of hi regular pace

head of the tabl he said if your worship will give me leav i will
tell you a stori of what happen in my villag about thi matter of

the moment sancho said thi don quixot trembl make sure that he

by the life of the duke sancho shall not be taken awai from me for a
moment said the duchess i am veri fond of him for i know he is
veri discreet
discreet be the dai of your holi said sancho for the good
opinion you have of my wit though there none in me but the stori i
want to tell is thi there wa an invit given by a gentleman of
my town a veri rich on and on of qualiti for he wa on of the
alamo of medina del campo and marri to doa mencia de quion the
daughter of don alonso de maraon knight of the order of santiago
that wa drown at the herradurahim there wa that quarrel about
year ago in our villag that my master don quixot wa mix up in
to the best of my belief that tomasillo the scapegrac the son of
balbastro the smith wa wound inisnt all thi true master mine
as you live sai so that these gentlefolk mai not take me for some
ly chatter
so far said the ecclesiast i take you to be more a chatter
than a liar but i dont know what i shall take you for byandbi
thou citest so mani wit and proof sancho said don quixot
that i have no choic but to sai thou must be tell the truth go
on and cut the stori short for thou art take the wai not to make an
end for two dai to come
he is not to cut it short said the duchess on the contrari for my
gratif he is to tell it as he know it though he should not
finish it these six dai and if he took so mani thei would be to me
the pleasantest i ever spent
well then sir i sai continu sancho that thi same gentleman
whom i know as well as i do my own hand for it not a bowshot from
my hous to hi invit a poor but respect labour
get on brother said the churchman at the rate you ar go you
will not stop with your stori short of the next world
ill stop less than halfwai pleas god said sancho and so i sai
thi labour come to the hous of the gentleman i spoke of that
invit himrest hi soul he is now dead and more by token he di
the death of an angel so thei sai for i wa not there for just at
that time i had gone to reap at temblequ
as you live my son said the churchman make hast back from
temblequ and finish your stori without buri the gentleman unless
you want to make more funer
well then it so happen said sancho that as the pair of them
were go to sit down to tableand i think i can see them now plainer
than ever
great wa the enjoy the duke and duchess deriv from the
irrit the worthi churchman show at the longwind halt wai
sancho had of tell hi stori while don quixot wa chafe with
rage and vexat
so as i wa sai continu sancho as the pair of them were
go to sit down to tabl as i said the labour insist upon the
gentleman take the head of the tabl and the gentleman insist
upon the labour take it as hi order should be obei in hi
hous but the labour who plume himself on hi polit and good
breed would not on ani account until the gentleman out of
patienc put hi hand on hi shoulder compel him by forc to
sit down sai sit down you stupid lout for wherev i sit will
be the head to you and that the stori and troth i think it hasnt
been brought in amiss here
don quixot turn all colour which on hi sunburnt face mottl it
till it look like jasper the duke and duchess suppress their
laughter so as not altogeth to mortifi don quixot for thei saw
through sancho impertin and to chang the convers and keep
sancho from utter more absurd the duchess ask don quixot
what new he had of the ladi dulcinea and if he had sent her ani
present of giant or miscreant late for he could not but have
vanquish a good mani
to which don quixot repli seora my misfortun though thei had
a begin will never have an end i have vanquish giant and i
have sent her caitiff and miscreant but where ar thei to find her
if she is enchant and turn into the most illfavour peasant wench
that can be imagin
i dont know said sancho panza to me she seem the fairest
creatur in the world at ani rate in nimbl and jump she wont
give in to a tumbler by my faith seora duchess she leap from the
ground on to the back of an ass like a cat
have you seen her enchant sancho ask the duke
what seen her said sancho why who the devil wa it but myself
that first thought of the enchant busi she is as much
enchant as my father
the ecclesiast when he heard them talk of giant and caitiff and
enchant began to suspect that thi must be don quixot of la
mancha whose stori the duke wa alwai read and he had himself
often reprov him for it tell him it wa foolish to read such
fooleri and becom convinc that hi suspicion wa correct
address the duke he said veri angrili to him seor your
excel will have to give account to god for what thi good man
doe thi don quixot or don simpleton or whatev hi name is
cannot i imagin be such a blockhead as your excel would have
him hold out encourag to him to go on with hi vagari and
folli then turn to address don quixot he said and you
numskul who put it into your head that you ar a knighterr and
vanquish giant and captur miscreant go your wai in a good hour
and in a good hour be it said to you go home and bring up your

in all the strait of some seminari and without have ever seen
more of the world than mai lie within twenti or thirti leagu round

to the abod of everlast life if gentlemen great lord nobl
men of high birth were to rate me as a fool i should take it as an

knight i am and knight i will die if such be the pleasur of the most
high some take the broad road of overween ambit other that of
mean and servil flatteri other that of deceit hypocrisi and some
that of true religion but i led by my star follow the narrow path of
knighterrantri and in pursuit of that call i despis wealth but
not honour i have redress injuri right wrong punish
insol vanquish giant and crush monster i am in love for
no other reason than that it is incumb on knightserr to be so
but though i am i am no carnalmind lover but on of the chast
platon sort my intent ar alwai direct to worthi end to do
good to all and evil to none and if he who mean thi doe thi and
make thi hi practic deserv to be call a fool it is for your
high to sai o most excel duke and duchess
good by god cri sancho sai no more in your own defenc master
mine for there noth more in the world to be said thought or
insist on and besid when thi gentleman deni as he ha that
there ar or ever have been ani knightserr in the world is it ani
wonder if he know noth of what he ha been talk about
perhap brother said the ecclesiast you ar that sancho panza
that is mention to whom your master ha promis an island
ye i am said sancho and what more i am on who deserv it as
much as anyon i am on of the sortattach thyself to the good and
thou wilt be on of them and of those not with whom thou art bred
but with whom thou art fed and of those who lean against a good
tree a good shade cover him i have leant upon a good master and i
have been for month go about with him and pleas god i shall be
just such anoth long life to him and long life to me for neither
will he be in ani want of empir to rule or i of island to govern
no sancho my friend certainli not said the duke for in the name
of seor don quixot i confer upon you the govern of on of no
small import that i have at my dispos
go down on thy knee sancho said don quixot and kiss the feet of
hi excel for the favour he ha bestow upon thee
sancho obei and on see thi the ecclesiast stood up from tabl
complet out of temper exclaim by the gown i wear i am almost
inclin to sai that your excel is as great a fool as these
sinner no wonder thei ar mad when peopl who ar in their sens
sanction their mad i leav your excel with them for so long
as thei ar in the hous i will remain in my own and spare myself the
troubl of reprov what i cannot remedi and without utter
anoth word or eat anoth morsel he went off the entreati of
the duke and duchess be entir unavail to stop him not that
the duke said much to him for he could not becaus of the laughter
hi uncalledfor anger provok
when he had done laugh he said to don quixot you have repli on
your own behalf so stoutli sir knight of the lion that there is no
occas to seek further satisfact for thi which though it mai
look like an offenc is not so at all for as women can give no
offenc no more can ecclesiast as you veri well know
that is true said don quixot and the reason is that he who is
not liabl to offenc cannot give offenc to anyon women children
and ecclesiast as thei cannot defend themselv though thei mai
receiv offenc cannot be insult becaus between the offenc and the
insult there is as your excel veri well know thi differ
the insult come from on who is capabl of offer it and doe so
and maintain it the offenc mai come from ani quarter without
carri insult to take an exampl a man is stand unsuspectingli
in the street and ten other come up arm and beat him he draw hi
sword and quit himself like a man but the number of hi antagonist
make it imposs for him to effect hi purpos and aveng himself
thi man suffer an offenc but not an insult anoth exampl will
make the same thing plain a man is stand with hi back turn
anoth come up and strike him and after strike him take to
flight without wait an instant and the other pursu him but doe
not overtak him he who receiv the blow receiv an offenc but not
an insult becaus an insult must be maintain if he who struck him
though he did so sneakingli and treacher had drawn hi sword and
stood and face him then he who had been struck would have receiv
offenc and insult at the same time offenc becaus he wa struck
treacher insult becaus he who struck him maintain what he had
done stand hi ground without take to flight and so accord
to the law of the accurs duel i mai have receiv offenc but not
insult for neither women nor children can maintain it nor can thei
wound nor have thei ani wai of stand their ground and it is just
the same with those connect with religion for these three sort of
person ar without arm offens or defens and so though
natur thei ar bound to defend themselv thei have no right to
offend anybodi and though i said just now i might have receiv
offenc i sai now certainli not for he who cannot receiv an insult
can still less give on for which reason i ought not to feel nor do
i feel aggriev at what that good man said to me i onli wish he had
stai a littl longer that i might have shown him the mistak he
make in suppos and maintain that there ar not and never have
been ani knightserr in the world had amadi or ani of hi
countless descend heard him sai as much i am sure it would not
have gone well with hi worship
i will take my oath of that said sancho thei would have given him
a slash that would have slit him down from top to toe like a
pomegran or a ripe melon thei were like fellow to put up with
joke of that sort by my faith im certain if reinaldo of montalvan
had heard the littl man word he would have given him such a spank
on the mouth that he wouldnt have spoken for the next three year ay
let him tackl them and hell see how hell get out of their hand
the duchess as she listen to sancho wa readi to die with laughter
and in her own mind she set him down as droller and madder than hi
master and there were a good mani just then who were of the same
opinion
don quixot final grew calm and dinner came to an end and as the
cloth wa remov four damsel came in on of them with a silver
basin anoth with a jug also of silver a third with two fine white
towel on her shoulder and the fourth with her arm bare to the
elbow and in her white hand for white thei certainli were a round
ball of napl soap the on with the basin approach and with arch
composur and impud thrust it under don quixot chin who
wonder at such a ceremoni said never a word suppos it to be the
custom of that countri to wash beard instead of hand he therefor
stretch hi out as far as he could and at the same instant the jug
began to pour and the damsel with the soap rub hi beard briskli
rais snowflak for the soap lather wa no less white not onli
over the beard but all over the face and over the ey of the
submiss knight so that thei were perforc oblig to keep shut the
duke and duchess who had not known anyth about thi wait to see
what came of thi strang wash the barber damsel when she had him
a hand breadth deep in lather pretend that there wa no more
water and bade the on with the jug go and fetch some while seor don
quixot wait she did so and don quixot wa left the strangest and
most ludicr figur that could be imagin all those present and
there were a good mani were watch him and as thei saw him there
with half a yard of neck and that uncommonli brown hi ey shut and
hi beard full of soap it wa a great wonder and onli by great
discret that thei were abl to restrain their laughter the
damsel the concoct of the joke kept their ey down not dare
to look at their master and mistress and as for them laughter and
anger struggl within them and thei knew not what to do whether to
punish the audac of the girl or to reward them for the amus
thei had receiv from see don quixot in such a plight
at length the damsel with the jug return and thei made an end of
wash don quixot and the on who carri the towel veri
deliber wipe him and dri him and all four togeth make him
a profound obeis and curtsei thei were about to go when the duke
lest don quixot should see through the joke call out to the on
with the basin sai come and wash me and take care that there is
water enough the girl sharpwit and prompt came and place the
basin for the duke as she had done for don quixot and thei soon had
him well soap and wash and have wipe him dry thei made their
obeis and retir it appear afterward that the duke had sworn
that if thei had not wash him as thei had don quixot he would have
punish them for their impud which thei adroitli aton for by
soap him as well
sancho observ the ceremoni of the wash veri attent and said
to himself god bless me if it were onli the custom in thi countri
to wash squir beard too as well as knight for by god and upon my
soul i want it badli and if thei gave me a scrape of the razor besid
id take it as a still greater kind
what ar you sai to yourself sancho ask the duchess
i wa sai seora he repli that in the court of other
princ when the cloth is taken awai i have alwai heard sai thei
give water for the hand but not lye for the beard and that show it
is good to live long that you mai see much to be sure thei sai too
that he who live a long life must undergo much evil though to undergo
a wash of that sort is pleasur rather than pain
dont be uneasi friend sancho said the duchess i will take care
that my damsel wash you and even put you in the tub if necessari
ill be content with the beard said sancho at ani rate for the
present and as for the futur god ha decre what is to be
attend to worthi sancho request senesch said the duchess and
do exactli what he wish
the senesch repli that seor sancho should be obei in everyth
and with that he went awai to dinner and took sancho along with him
while the duke and duchess and don quixot remain at tabl discuss
a great varieti of thing but all bear on the call of arm and
knighterrantri
the duchess beg don quixot as he seem to have a retent
memori to describ and portrai to her the beauti and featur of the
ladi dulcinea del toboso for judg by what fame trumpet abroad of
her beauti she felt sure she must be the fairest creatur in the
world nai in all la mancha
don quixot sigh on hear the duchesss request and said if i
could pluck out my heart and lai it on a plate on thi tabl here
befor your highnesss ey it would spare my tongu the pain of
tell what can hardli be thought of for in it your excel would
see her portrai in full but why should i attempt to depict and
describ in detail and featur by featur the beauti of the peerless
dulcinea the burden be on worthi of other shoulder than mine an
enterpris wherein the pencil of parrhasiu timant and apel
and the graver of lysippu ought to be emploi to paint it in
pictur and carv it in marbl and bronz and ciceronian and
demosthenian eloqu to sound it prais
what doe demosthenian mean seor don quixot said the duchess it
is a word i never heard in all my life
demosthenian eloqu said don quixot mean the eloqu of
demosthen as ciceronian mean that of cicero who were the two most
eloqu orat in the world
true said the duke you must have lost your wit to ask such a
question nevertheless seor don quixot would greatli gratifi us if
he would depict her to us for never fear even in an outlin or sketch
she will be someth to make the fairest enviou
i would do so certainli said don quixot had she not been blur
to my mind ey by the misfortun that fell upon her a short time
sinc on of such a natur that i am more readi to weep over it than
to describ it for your high must know that go a few dai
back to kiss her hand and receiv her benedict approb and
permiss for thi third salli i found her altogeth a differ
be from the on i sought i found her enchant and chang from a
princess into a peasant from fair to foul from an angel into a devil
from fragrant to pestifer from refin to clownish from a
dignifi ladi into a jump tomboi and in a word from dulcinea del
toboso into a coars sayago wench
god bless me said the duke aloud at thi who can have done the
world such an injuri who can have rob it of the beauti that
gladden it of the grace and gaieti that charm it of the modesti
that shed a lustr upon it
who repli don quixot who could it be but some malign
enchant of the mani that persecut me out of envythat accurs race
born into the world to obscur and bring to naught the achiev of
the good and glorifi and exalt the deed of the wick enchant
have persecut me enchant persecut me still and enchant will
continu to persecut me until thei have sunk me and my lofti chivalri
in the deep abyss of oblivion and thei injur and wound me where thei
know i feel it most for to depriv a knighterr of hi ladi is to
depriv him of the ey he see with of the sun that give him light
of the food wherebi he live mani a time befor have i said it and i
sai it now onc more a knighterr without a ladi is like a tree
without leav a build without a foundat or a shadow without
the bodi that caus it
there is no deni it said the duchess but still if we ar to
believ the histori of don quixot that ha come out here late with
gener applaus it is to be infer from it if i mistak not that
you never saw the ladi dulcinea and that the said ladi is noth in
the world but an imaginari ladi on that you yourself begot and gave
birth to in your brain and adorn with whatev charm and
perfect you chose
there is a good deal to be said on that point said don quixot god
know whether there be ani dulcinea or not in the world or whether she
is imaginari or not imaginari these ar thing the proof of which must
not be push to extrem length i have not begotten nor given birth
to my ladi though i behold her as she need must be a ladi who
contain in herself all the qualiti to make her famou throughout the
world beauti without blemish dignifi without haughti tender
and yet modest graciou from courtesi and courteou from good
breed and lastli of exalt lineag becaus beauti shine forth
and excel with a higher degre of perfect upon good blood than in
the fair of lowli birth
that is true said the duke but seor don quixot will give me
leav to sai what i am constrain to sai by the stori of hi exploit
that i have read from which it is to be infer that grant there
is a dulcinea in el toboso or out of it and that she is in the
highest degre beauti as you have describ her to us as regard
the lofti of her lineag she is not on a par with the oriana
alastrajarea madasima or other of that sort with whom as you
well know the histori abound
to that i mai repli said don quixot that dulcinea is the daughter
of her own work and that virtu rectifi blood and that lowli virtu
is more to be regard and esteem than exalt vice dulcinea
besid ha that within her that mai rais her to be a crown and
sceptr queen for the merit of a fair and virtuou woman is capabl
of perform greater miracl and virtual though not formal she
ha in herself higher fortun
i protest seor don quixot said the duchess that in all you sai
you go most cautious and lead in hand as the sai is henceforth i
will believ myself and i will take care that everyon in my hous
believ even my lord the duke if need be that there is a dulcinea
in el toboso and that she is live todai and that she is beauti
and nobli born and deserv to have such a knight as seor don quixot
in her servic and that is the highest prais that it is in my power
to give her or that i can think of but i cannot help entertain a
doubt and have a certain grudg against sancho panza the doubt is
thi that the aforesaid histori declar that the said sancho panza
when he carri a letter on your worship behalf to the said ladi
dulcinea found her sift a sack of wheat and more by token it sai
it wa red wheat a thing which make me doubt the lofti of her
lineag
to thi don quixot made answer seora your high must know that
everyth or almost everyth that happen me transcend the ordinari
limit of what happen to other knightserr whether it be that it
is direct by the inscrut will of destini or by the malic of
some jealou enchant now it is an establish fact that all or most
famou knightserr have some special gift on that of be proof
against enchant anoth that of be made of such invulner
flesh that he cannot be wound as wa the famou roland on of the
twelv peer of franc of whom it is relat that he could not be
wound except in the sole of hi left foot and that it must be with
the point of a stout pin and not with ani other sort of weapon
whatev and so when bernardo del carpio slew him at roncesval
find that he could not wound him with steel he lift him up from
the ground in hi arm and strangl him call to mind season
the death which hercul inflict on antu the fierc giant that
thei sai wa the son of terra i would infer from what i have mention
that perhap i mai have some gift of thi kind not that of be
invulner becaus experi ha mani time prove to me that i am
of tender flesh and not at all impenetr nor that of be proof
against enchant for i have alreadi seen myself thrust into a cage
in which all the world would not have been abl to confin me except by
forc of enchant but as i deliv myself from that on i am
inclin to believ that there is no other that can hurt me and so
these enchant see that thei cannot exert their vile craft
against my person reveng themselv on what i love most and seek to
rob me of life by maltreat that of dulcinea in whom i live and
therefor i am convinc that when my squir carri my messag to her
thei chang her into a common peasant girl engag in such a mean
occup as sift wheat i have alreadi said howev that that
wheat wa not red wheat nor wheat at all but grain of orient pearl
and as a proof of all thi i must tell your high that come to
el toboso a short time back i wa altogeth unabl to discov the
palac of dulcinea and that the next dai though sancho my squir
saw her in her own proper shape which is the fairest in the world to
me she appear to be a coars illfavour farmwench and by no
mean a wellspoken on she who is proprieti itself and so as i am
not and so far as on can judg cannot be enchant she it is that
is enchant that is smitten that is alter chang and
transform in her have my enemi reveng themselv upon me and
for her shall i live in ceaseless tear until i see her in her
pristin state i have mention thi lest anybodi should mind what
sancho said about dulcinea winnow or sift for as thei chang
her to me it is no wonder if thei chang her to him dulcinea is
illustri and wellborn and of on of the gentl famili of el
toboso which ar mani ancient and good therein most assuredli not
small is the share of the peerless dulcinea through whom her town will
be famou and celebr in ag to come as troi wa through helen
and spain through la cava though with a better titl and tradit
for anoth thing i would have your grace understand that sancho
panza is on of the drollest squir that ever serv knighterr
sometim there is a simplic about him so acut that it is an
amus to try and make out whether he is simpl or sharp he ha
mischiev trick that stamp him rogu and blunder wai that prove
him a boobi he doubt everyth and believ everyth when i fanci
he is on the point of come down headlong from sheer stupid he
come out with someth shrewd that send him up to the ski after
all i would not exchang him for anoth squir though i were given a
citi to boot and therefor i am in doubt whether it will be well to
send him to the govern your high ha bestow upon him though
i perceiv in him a certain aptitud for the work of govern so
that with a littl trim of hi understand he would manag ani
govern as easili as the king doe hi tax and moreov we know
alreadi ampl experi that it doe not requir much clever or
much learn to be a governor for there ar a hundr round about us
that scarc know how to read and govern like gerfalcon the main
point is that thei should have good intent and be desir of do
right in all thing for thei will never be at a loss for person to
advis and direct them in what thei have to do like those
knightgovernor who be no lawyer pronounc sentenc with the
aid of an assessor my advic to him will be to take no bribe and
surrend no right and i have some other littl matter in reserv
that shall be produc in due season for sancho benefit and the
advantag of the island he is to govern
the duke duchess and don quixot had reach thi point in their
convers when thei heard voic and a great hubbub in the palac
and sancho burst abruptli into the room all glow with anger with a
strainingcloth by wai of a bib and follow by sever servant or
more properli speak kitchenboi and other underl on of whom
carri a small trough full of water that from it colour and impur
wa plainli dishwat the on with the trough pursu him and follow
him everywher he went endeavour with the utmost persist to
thrust it under hi chin while anoth kitchenboi seem anxiou to
wash hi beard
what is all thi brother ask the duchess what is it what do
you want to do to thi good man do you forget he is a governorelect
to which the barber kitchenboi repli the gentleman will not let
himself be wash as is customari and as my lord and the seor hi
master have been
ye i will said sancho in a great rage but id like it to be
with cleaner towel clearer lye and not such dirti hand for there
not so much differ between me and my master that he should be
wash with angel water and i with devil lye the custom of
countri and princ palac ar onli good so long as thei give no
annoy but the wai of wash thei have here is wors than do
penanc i have a clean beard and i dont requir to be refresh in
that fashion and whoever come to wash me or touch a hair of my head
i mean to sai my beard with all due respect be it said ill give him
a punch that will leav my fist sunk in hi skull for cirimoni and
soap of thi sort ar more like joke than the polit attent of
on host
the duchess wa readi to die with laughter when she saw sancho rage
and heard hi word but it wa no pleasur to don quixot to see him
in such a sorri trim with the dingi towel about him and the
hangerson of the kitchen all round him so make a low bow to the
duke and duchess as if to ask their permiss to speak he address
the rout in a dignifi tone holloa gentlemen you let that youth
alon and go back to where you came from or anywher els if you
like my squir is as clean as ani other person and those trough ar
as bad as narrow thinneck jar to him take my advic and leav him
alon for neither he nor i understand joke
sancho took the word out of hi mouth and went on nai let them come
and try their joke on the countri bumpkin for it about as like
ill stand them as that it now midnight let them bring me a comb
here or what thei pleas and curri thi beard of mine and if thei
get anyth out of it that offend against cleanli let them clip
me to the skin
upon thi the duchess laugh all the while said sancho panza is
right and alwai will be in all he sai he is clean and as he sai
himself he doe not requir to be wash and if our wai do not
pleas him he is free to choos besid you promot of cleanli
have been excess careless and thoughtless i dont know if i ought
not to sai audaci to bring trough and wooden utensil and kitchen
dishclout instead of basin and jug of pure gold and towel of
holland to such a person and such a beard but after all you ar
illcondit and illbr and spite as you ar you cannot help
show the grudg you have against the squir of knightserr
the impud servitor and even the senesch who came with them took
the duchess to be speak in earnest so thei remov the
strainingcloth from sancho neck and with someth like shame and
confus of face went off all of them and left him whereupon he
see himself safe out of that extrem danger as it seem to him
ran and fell on hi knee befor the duchess sai from great
ladi great favour mai be look for thi which your grace ha done
me todai cannot be requit with less than wish i wa dub a
knighterr to devot myself all the dai of my life to the servic
of so exalt a ladi i am a labour man my name is sancho panza i
am marri i have children and i am serv as a squir if in ani
on of these wai i can serv your high i will not be longer in
obei than your grace in command
it is easi to see sancho repli the duchess that you have
learn to be polit in the school of polit itself i mean to sai
it is easi to see that you have been nurs in the bosom of seor don
quixot who is of cours the cream of good breed and flower of
ceremonyor cirimoni as you would sai yourself fair be the fortun
of such a master and such a servant the on the cynosur of
knighterrantri the other the star of squir fidel rise sancho
my friend i will repai your courtesi by take care that my lord the
duke make good to you the promis gift of the govern as soon as
possibl
with thi the convers came to an end and don quixot retir to
take hi middai sleep but the duchess beg sancho unless he had a
veri great desir to go to sleep to come and spend the afternoon with
her and her damsel in a veri cool chamber sancho repli that though
he certainli had the habit of sleep four or five hour in the heat
of the dai in summer to serv her excel he would try with all hi
might not to sleep even on that dai and that he would come in
obedi to her command and with that he went off the duke gave
fresh order with respect to treat don quixot as a knighterr
without depart even in smallest particular from the style in which
as the stori tell us thei us to treat the knight of old

the histori record that sancho did not sleep that afternoon but in
order to keep hi word came befor he had well done dinner to visit
the duchess who find enjoy in listen to him made him sit
down besid her on a low seat though sancho out of pure good
breed want not to sit down the duchess howev told him he wa
to sit down as governor and talk as squir as in both respect he wa
worthi of even the chair of the cid rui diaz the campeador sancho
shrug hi shoulder obei and sat down and all the duchesss
damsel and duenna gather round him wait in profound silenc to
hear what he would sai it wa the duchess howev who spoke first
sai
now that we ar alon and that there is nobodi here to overhear us i
should be glad if the seor governor would reliev me of certain doubt
i have rise out of the histori of the great don quixot that is now
in print on is inasmuch as worthi sancho never saw dulcinea i mean
the ladi dulcinea del toboso nor took don quixot letter to her for
it wa left in the memorandum book in the sierra morena how did he
dare to invent the answer and all that about find her sift wheat
the whole stori be a decept and falsehood and so much to the
prejudic of the peerless dulcinea good name a thing that is not at
all becom the charact and fidel of a good squir

at these word sancho without utter on in repli got up from hi
chair and with noiseless step with hi bodi bent and hi finger on
hi lip went all round the room lift up the hang and thi
done he came back to hi seat and said now seora that i have seen
that there is no on except the bystand listen to us on the sly
i will answer what you have ask me and all you mai ask me without
fear or dread and the first thing i have got to sai is that for my
own part i hold my master don quixot to be stark mad though sometim
he sai thing that to my mind and inde everybodi that listen to
him ar so wise and run in such a straight furrow that satan himself
could not have said them better but for all that realli and beyond
all question it my firm belief he is crack well then as thi is
clear to my mind i can ventur to make him believ thing that have
neither head nor tail like that affair of the answer to the letter
and that other of six or eight dai ago which is not yet in histori
that is to sai the affair of the enchant of my ladi dulcinea for
i made him believ she is enchant though there no more truth in it
than over the hill of beda
the duchess beg him to tell her about the enchant or decept
so sancho told the whole stori exactli as it had happen and hi
hearer were not a littl amus by it and then resum the duchess
said in consequ of what worthi sancho ha told me a doubt start
up in my mind and there come a kind of whisper to my ear that sai
if don quixot be mad crazi and crack and sancho panza hi squir
know it and notwithstand serv and follow him and goe
trust to hi empti promis there can be no doubt he must be still
madder and sillier than hi master and that be so it will be cast
in your teeth seora duchess if you give the said sancho an island to
govern for how will he who doe not know how to govern himself know
how to govern other
by god seora said sancho but that doubt come time but your
grace mai sai it out and speak plainli or as you like for i know
what you sai is true and if i were wise i should have left my master
long ago but thi wa my fate thi wa my bad luck i cant help it
i must follow him were from the same villag iv eaten hi bread
im fond of him im grate he gave me hi asscolt and abov all
im faith so it quit imposs for anyth to separ us
except the pickax and shovel and if your high doe not like to
give me the govern you promis god made me without it and mayb
your not give it to me will be all the better for my conscienc for
fool as i am i know the proverb to her hurt the ant got wing and it
mai be that sancho the squir will get to heaven sooner than sancho the
governor thei make as good bread here as in franc and by night
all cat ar grei and a hard case enough hi who hasnt broken hi
fast at two in the afternoon and there no stomach a hand breadth
bigger than anoth and the same can be fill with straw or hai
as the sai is and the littl bird of the field have god for their
purveyor and cater and four yard of cuenca friez keep on warmer
than four of segovia broadcloth and when we quit thi world and ar
put underground the princ travel by as narrow a path as the
journeyman and the pope bodi doe not take up more feet of earth
than the sacristan for all that the on is higher than the other
for when we go to our grave we all pack ourselv up and make
ourselv small or rather thei pack us up and make us small in spite
of us and thengood night to us and i sai onc more if your ladyship
doe not like to give me the island becaus im a fool like a wise man
i will take care to give myself no troubl about it i have heard sai
that behind the cross there the devil and that all that glitter
is not gold and that from among the oxen and the plough and the
yoke wamba the husbandman wa taken to be made king of spain and
from among brocad and pleasur and rich roderick wa taken to
be devour by adder if the vers of the old ballad dont lie
to be sure thei dont lie exclaim doa rodriguez the duenna who
wa on of the listen why there a ballad that sai thei put
king rodrigo aliv into a tomb full of toad and adder and lizard
and that two dai afterward the king in a plaintiv feebl voic
cri out from within the tomb
thei gnaw me now thei gnaw me now
there where i most did sin
and accord to that the gentleman ha good reason to sai he would
rather be a labour man than a king if vermin ar to eat him
the duchess could not help laugh at the simplic of her duenna or
wonder at the languag and proverb of sancho to whom she said
worthi sancho know veri well that when onc a knight ha made a
promis he strive to keep it though it should cost him hi life my
lord and husband the duke though not on of the errant sort is none
the less a knight for that reason and will keep hi word about the
promis island in spite of the envi and malic of the world let
sancho be of good cheer for when he least expect it he will find
himself seat on the throne of hi island and seat of digniti and
will take possess of hi govern that he mai discard it for
anoth of threebord brocad the charg i give him is to be
care how he govern hi vassal bear in mind that thei ar all
loyal and wellborn
as to govern them well said sancho there no need of charg
me to do that for im kindheart by natur and full of compass
for the poor there no steal the loaf from him who knead and
bake and by my faith it wont do to throw fals dice with me i am
an old dog and i know all about tu tu i can be wideawak if
need be and i dont let cloud come befor my ey for i know where
the shoe pinch me i sai so becaus with me the good will have
support and protect and the bad neither foot nor access and it
seem to me that in govern to make a begin is everyth
and mayb after have been governor a fortnight ill take kindli to
the work and know more about it than the field labour i have been
brought up to
you ar right sancho said the duchess for no on is born readi
taught and the bishop ar made out of men and not out of stone but
to return to the subject we were discuss just now the enchant
of the ladi dulcinea i look upon it as certain and someth more
than evid that sancho idea of practis a decept upon hi
master make him believ that the peasant girl wa dulcinea and that
if he did not recognis her it must be becaus she wa enchant wa
all a devic of on of the enchant that persecut don quixot for
in truth and earnest i know from good author that the coars
countri wench who jump up on the ass wa and is dulcinea del toboso
and that worthi sancho though he fanci himself the deceiv is the
on that is deceiv and that there is no more reason to doubt the
truth of thi than of anyth els we never saw seor sancho panza
must know that we too have enchant here that ar well dispos to
us and tell us what goe on in the world plainli and distinctli
without subterfug or decept and believ me sancho that agil
countri lass wa and is dulcinea del toboso who is as much enchant
as the mother that bore her and when we least expect it we shall see
her in her own proper form and then sancho will be disabus of the
error he is under at present
all that veri possibl said sancho panza and now im will to
believ what my master sai about what he saw in the cave of
montesino where he sai he saw the ladi dulcinea del toboso in the
veri same dress and apparel that i said i had seen her in when i
enchant her all to pleas myself it must be all exactli the other
wai as your ladyship sai becaus it is imposs to suppos that
out of my poor wit such a cun trick could be concoct in a moment
nor do i think my master is so mad that by my weak and feebl
persuas he could be made to believ a thing so out of all reason
but seora your excel must not therefor think me illdispos
for a dolt like me is not bound to see into the thought and plot of
those vile enchant i invent all that to escap my master
scold and not with ani intent of hurt him and if it ha
turn out differ there is a god in heaven who judg our
heart
that is true said the duchess but tell me sancho what is thi
you sai about the cave of montesino for i should like to know
sancho upon thi relat to her word for word what ha been said
alreadi touch that adventur and have heard it the duchess said
from thi occurr it mai be infer that as the great don quixot
sai he saw there the same countri wench sancho saw on the wai from el
toboso it is no doubt dulcinea and that there ar some veri activ
and exceedingli busi enchant about
so i sai said sancho and if my ladi dulcinea is enchant so much
the wors for her and im not go to pick a quarrel with my master
enemi who seem to be mani and spite the truth is that the on i
saw wa a countri wench and i set her down to be a countri wench and
if that wa dulcinea it must not be laid at my door nor should i be
call to answer for it or take the consequ but thei must go
nag at me at everi stepsancho said it sancho did it sancho
here sancho there as if sancho wa nobodi at all and not that same
sancho panza that now go all over the world in book so samson
carrasco told me and he at ani rate on that a bachelor of
salamanca and peopl of that sort cant lie except when the whim
seiz them or thei have some veri good reason for it so there no
occas for anybodi to quarrel with me and then i have a good
charact and as i have heard my master sai a good name is better
than great rich let them onli stick me into thi govern and
theyll see wonder for on who ha been a good squir will be a good
governor
all worthi sancho observ said the duchess ar catonian
sentenc or at ani rate out of the veri heart of michael verino
himself who florentibu occidit anni in fact to speak in hi own
style under a bad cloak there often a good drinker
inde seora said sancho i never yet drank out of wicked
from thirst i have veri like for i have noth of the hypocrit in
me i drink when im inclin or if im not inclin when thei offer
it to me so as not to look either straitlac or illbr for when a
friend drink on health what heart can be so hard as not to return
it but if i put on my shoe i dont dirti them besid squir to
knightserr mostli drink water for thei ar alwai wander among
wood forest and meadow mountain and crag without a drop of wine
to be had if thei gave their ey for it
so i believ said the duchess and now let sancho go and take hi
sleep and we will talk byandbi at greater length and settl how he
mai soon go and stick himself into the govern as he sai
sancho onc more kiss the duchesss hand and entreat her to let
good care be taken of hi dappl for he wa the light of hi ey
what is dappl said the duchess
my ass said sancho which not to mention him by that name im
accustom to call dappl i beg thi ladi duenna here to take care
of him when i came into the castl and she got as angri as if i had
said she wa ugli or old though it ought to be more natur and proper
for duenna to feed ass than to ornament chamber god bless me what
a spite a gentleman of my villag had against these ladi
he must have been some clown said doa rodriguez the duenna for if
he had been a gentleman and wellborn he would have exalt them higher
than the horn of the moon
that will do said the duchess no more of thi hush doa
rodriguez and let seor panza rest easi and leav the treatment of
dappl in my charg for as he is a treasur of sancho ill put him
on the appl of my ey
it will be enough for him to be in the stabl said sancho for
neither he nor i ar worthi to rest a moment in the appl of your
highnesss ey and id as soon stab myself as consent to it for
though my master sai that in civil it is better to lose by a card
too mani than a card too few when it come to civil to ass we
must mind what we ar about and keep within due bound
take him to your govern sancho said the duchess and there you
will be abl to make as much of him as you like and even releas him
from work and pension him off
dont think seora duchess that you have said anyth absurd said
sancho i have seen more than two ass go to govern and for me
to take mine with me would be noth new
sancho word made the duchess laugh again and gave her fresh
amus and dismiss him to sleep she went awai to tell the duke
the convers she had had with him and between them thei plot
and arrang to plai a joke upon don quixot that wa to be a rare on
and entir in knighterrantri style and in that same style thei
practis sever upon him so much in keep and so clever that thei

great wa the pleasur the duke and duchess took in the convers of
don quixot and sancho panza and more bent than ever upon the plan
thei had of practis some joke upon them that should have the look
and appear of adventur thei took as their basi of action what
don quixot had alreadi told them about the cave of montesino in
order to plai him a famou on but what the duchess marvel at abov
all wa that sancho simplic could be so great as to make him
believ as absolut truth that dulcinea had been enchant when it wa
he himself who had been the enchant and trickster in the busi

do six dai afterward thei took him out to hunt with as great a
retinu of huntsmen and beater as a crown king

of the finest green cloth but don quixot declin to put hi on
sai that he must soon return to the hard pursuit of arm and could
not carri wardrob or store with him sancho howev took what thei
gave him mean to sell it at the first opportun
the appoint dai have arriv don quixot arm himself and sancho
arrai himself and mount on hi dappl for he would not give him
up though thei offer him a hors he place himself in the midst of
the troop of huntsmen the duchess came out splendidli attir and don
quixot in pure courtesi and polit held the rein of her palfrei
though the duke want not to allow him and at last thei reach a
wood that lai between two high mountain where after occupi
variou post ambush and path and distribut the parti in
differ posit the hunt began with great nois shout and
halloo so that between the bai of the hound and the blow of
the horn thei could not hear on anoth the duchess dismount and
with a sharp boarspear in her hand post herself where she knew the
wild boar were in the habit of pass the duke and don quixot
likewis dismount and place themselv on at each side of her
sancho took up a posit in the rear of all without dismount from
dappl whom he dare not desert lest some mischief should befal him
scarc had thei taken their stand in a line with sever of their
servant when thei saw a huge boar close press by the hound and
follow by the huntsmen make toward them grind hi teeth and
tusk and scatter foam from hi mouth as soon as he saw him don
quixot brace hi shield on hi arm and draw hi sword advanc
to meet him the duke with boarspear did the same but the duchess
would have gone in front of them all had not the duke prevent her
sancho alon desert dappl at the sight of the mighti beast took
to hi heel as hard as he could and strove in vain to mount a tall
oak as he wa cling to a branch howev halfwai up in hi
struggl to reach the top the bough such wa hi illluck and hard
fate gave wai and caught in hi fall by a broken limb of the oak he
hung suspend in the air unabl to reach the ground find himself
in thi posit and that the green coat wa begin to tear and
reflect that if the fierc anim came that wai he might be abl to
get at him he began to utter such cri and call for help so
earnestli that all who heard him and did not see him felt sure he must
be in the teeth of some wild beast in the end the tusk boar fell
pierc by the blade of the mani spear thei held in front of him and
don quixot turn round at the cri of sancho for he knew by them
that it wa he saw him hang from the oak head downward with
dappl who did not forsak him in hi distress close besid him and
cide hamet observ that he seldom saw sancho panza without see
dappl or dappl without see sancho panza such wa their
attach and loyalti on to the other don quixot went over and
unhook sancho who as soon as he found himself on the ground look
at the rent in hi huntingcoat and wa griev to the heart for he
thought he had got a patrimoni estat in that suit
meanwhil thei had slung the mighti boar across the back of a mule and
have cover it with sprig of rosemari and branch of myrtl thei
bore it awai as the spoil of victori to some larg fieldtent which
had been pitch in the middl of the wood where thei found the tabl
laid and dinner serv in such grand and sumptuou style that it wa
easi to see the rank and magnific of those who had provid it
sancho as he show the rent in hi torn suit to the duchess
observ if we had been hunt hare or after small bird my coat
would have been safe from be in the plight it in i dont know
what pleasur on can find in ly in wait for an anim that mai take
your life with hi tusk if he get at you i recollect have heard an
old ballad sung that sai
by bear be thou devour as erst
wa famou favila
that said don quixot wa a gothic king who go ahunt wa
devour by a bear
just so said sancho and i would not have king and princ expos
themselv to such danger for the sake of a pleasur which to my
mind ought not to be on as it consist in kill an anim that ha
done no harm whatev
quit the contrari sancho you ar wrong there said the duke for
hunt is more suitabl and requisit for king and princ than for
anybodi els the chase is the emblem of war it ha stratagem wile
and crafti devic for overcom the enemi in safeti in it extrem
cold and intoler heat have to be born indol and sleep ar
despis the bodili power ar invigor the limb of him who
engag in it ar made suppl and in a word it is a pursuit which
mai be follow without injuri to anyon and with enjoy to mani
and the best of it is it is not for everybodi as fieldsport of
other sort ar except hawk which also is onli for king and great
lord reconsid your opinion therefor sancho and when you ar
governor take to hunt and you will find the good of it
nai said sancho the good governor should have a broken leg and
keep at home it would be a nice thing if after peopl had been at
the troubl of come to look for him on busi the governor were to
be awai in the forest enjoi himself the govern would go on
badli in that fashion by my faith seor hunt and amus ar
more fit for idler than for governor what i intend to amus myself
with is plai all four at eastertim and bowl on sundai and
holidai for these hunt dont suit my condit or agre with my
conscienc
god grant it mai turn out so said the duke becaus it a long
step from sai to do
be that as it mai said sancho pledg dont distress a good
payer and he whom god help doe better than he who get up earli
and it the tripe that carri the feet and not the feet the tripe
i mean to sai that if god give me help and i do my duti honestli no
doubt ill govern better than a gerfalcon nai let them onli put a
finger in my mouth and theyll see whether i can bite or not
the curs of god and all hi saint upon thee thou accurs sancho
exclaim don quixot when will the dai comea i have often said to
theewhen i shall hear thee make on singl coher ration remark
without proverb prai your high leav thi fool alon for he
will grind your soul between not to sai two but two thousand
proverb drag in as much in season and as much to the purpos
asmai god grant as much health to him or to me if i want to listen to
them
sancho panza proverb said the duchess though more in number
than the greek command ar not therefor less to be esteem for
the concis of the maxim for my own part i can sai thei give me
more pleasur than other that mai be better brought in and more
season introduc
in pleasant convers of thi sort thei pass out of the tent into
the wood and the dai wa spent in visit some of the post and
hidingplac and then night close in not howev as brilliantli
or tranquilli as might have been expect at the season for it wa
then midsumm but bring with it a kind of haze that greatli aid
the project of the duke and duchess and thu as night began to fall
and a littl after twilight set in suddenli the whole wood on all four
side seem to be on fire and shortli after here there on all
side a vast number of trumpet and other militari instrument were
heard as if sever troop of cavalri were pass through the wood
the blaze of the fire and the nois of the warlik instrument almost
blind the ey and deafen the ear of those that stood by and
inde of all who were in the wood then there were heard repeat
lelili after the fashion of the moor when thei rush to battl
trumpet and clarion brai drum beat fife plai so unceasingli
and so fast that he could not have had ani sens who did not lose them
with the confus din of so mani instrument the duke wa astound
the duchess amaz don quixot wonder sancho panza trembl and
inde even thei who were awar of the caus were frighten in their
fear silenc fell upon them and a postillion in the guis of a
demon pass in front of them blow in lieu of a bugl a huge
hollow horn that gave out a horribl hoars note
ho there brother courier cri the duke who ar you where ar
you go what troop ar these that seem to be pass through the
wood
to which the courier repli in a harsh discord voic i am the
devil i am in search of don quixot of la mancha those who ar come
thi wai ar six troop of enchant who ar bring on a triumphal
car the peerless dulcinea del toboso she come under enchant
togeth with the gallant frenchman montesino to give instruct to
don quixot as to how she the said ladi mai be disench
if you were the devil as you sai and as your appear indic
said the duke you would have known the said knight don quixot of la
mancha for you have him here befor you
by god and upon my conscienc said the devil i never observ it
for my mind is occupi with so mani differ thing that i wa
forget the main thing i came about
thi demon must be an honest fellow and a good christian said
sancho for if he wasnt he wouldnt swear by god and hi conscienc
i feel sure now there must be good soul even in hell itself
without dismount the demon then turn to don quixot and said
the unfortun but valiant knight montesino send me to thee the
knight of the lion would that i saw thee in their claw bid me
tell thee to wait for him wherev i mai find thee as he bring with
him her whom thei call dulcinea del toboso that he mai show thee what
is need in order to disench her and as i came for no more i need
stai no longer demon of my sort be with thee and good angel with
these gentl and so sai he blew hi huge horn turn about and
went off without wait for a repli from anyon
thei all felt fresh wonder but particularli sancho and don quixot
sancho to see how in defianc of the truth thei would have it that
dulcinea wa enchant don quixot becaus he could not feel sure
whether what had happen to him in the cave of montesino wa true or
not and as he wa deep in these cogit the duke said to him do
you mean to wait seor don quixot
why not repli he here will i wait fearless and firm though all
hell should come to attack me
well then if i see anoth devil or hear anoth horn like the last
ill wait here as much as in flander said sancho
night now close in more complet and mani light began to flit
through the wood just as those fieri exhal from the earth that
look like shootingstar to our ey flit through the heaven a
fright nois too wa heard like that made by the solid wheel the
oxcart usual have by the harsh ceaseless creak of which thei
sai the bear and wolv ar put to flight if there happen to be ani
where thei ar pass in addit to all thi commot there came a
further disturb to increas the tumult for now it seem as if in
truth on all four side of the wood four encount or battl were
go on at the same time in on quarter resound the dull nois of a
terribl cannonad in anoth numberless musket were be
discharg the shout of the combat sound almost close at hand
and farther awai the moorish lelili were rais again and again in a
word the bugl the horn the clarion the trumpet the drum the
cannon the musketri and abov all the tremend nois of the cart
all made up togeth a din so confus and terrif that don quixot
had need to summon up all hi courag to brave it but sancho gave
wai and he fell faint on the skirt of the duchesss robe who let
him lie there and promptli bade them throw water in hi face thi wa
done and he came to himself by the time that on of the cart with the
creak wheel reach the spot it wa drawn by four plod oxen
all cover with black hous on each horn thei had fix a larg
light wax taper and on the top of the cart wa construct a rais
seat on which sat a vener old man with a beard whiter than the
veri snow and so long that it fell below hi waist he wa dress in
a long robe of black buckram for as the cart wa thickli set with a
multitud of candl it wa easi to make out everyth that wa on it
lead it were two hideou demon also clad in buckram with
counten so fright that sancho have onc seen them shut hi
ey so as not to see them again as soon as the cart came opposit the
spot the old man rose from hi lofti seat and stand up said in a
loud voic i am the sage lirgandeo and without anoth word the
cart then pass on behind it came anoth of the same form with
anoth ag man enthron who stop the cart said in a voic no
less solemn than that of the first i am the sage alquif the great
friend of urganda the unknown and pass on then anoth cart came
by at the same pace but the occup of the throne wa not old like
the other but a man stalwart and robust and of a forbid
counten who as he came up said in a voic far hoarser and more
devilish i am the enchant archelau the mortal enemi of amadi of
gaul and all hi kindr and then pass on have gone a short
distanc the three cart halt and the monoton nois of their
wheel ceas and soon after thei heard anoth not nois but sound
of sweet harmoni music of which sancho wa veri glad take it to
be a good sign and said he to the duchess from whom he did not stir a
step or for a singl instant seora where there music there cant
be mischief
nor where there ar light and it is bright said the duchess to
which sancho repli fire give light and it bright where there
ar bonfir as we see by those that ar all round us and perhap mai
burn us but music is a sign of mirth and merrymak
that remain to be seen said don quixot who wa listen to all
that pass and he wa right as is shown in the follow chapter

well then the fact is friend sancho said the duke that unless
you becom softer than a ripe fig you shall not get hold of the
govern it would be a nice thing for me to send my island a
cruel governor with flinti bowel who wont yield to the tear of
afflict damsel or to the prayer of wise magisteri ancient
enchant and sage in short sancho either you must be whip by
yourself or thei must whip you or you shant be governor
seor said sancho wont two dai grace be given me in which to
consid what is best for me
no certainli not said merlin here thi minut and on the spot
the matter must be settl either dulcinea will return to the cave of
montesino and to her former condit of peasant wench or els in her
present form shall be carri to the elysian field where she will
remain wait until the number of stripe is complet
now then sancho said the duchess show courag and gratitud for
your master don quixot bread that you have eaten we ar all bound
to oblig and pleas him for hi benevol disposit and lofti
chivalri consent to thi whip my son to the devil with the
devil and leav fear to milksop for a stout heart break bad luck
as you veri well know
to thi sancho repli with an irrelev remark which address
merlin he made to him will your worship tell me seor merlinwhen
that courier devil came up he gave my master a messag from seor
montesino charg him to wait for him here as he wa come to
arrang how the ladi doa dulcinea del toboso wa to be disench
but up to the present we have not seen montesino nor anyth like
him
to which merlin made answer the devil sancho is a blockhead and a
great scoundrel i sent him to look for your master but not with a
messag from montesino but from myself for montesino is in hi cave
expect or more properli speak wait for hi disenchant
for there the tail to be skin yet for him if he ow you
anyth or you have ani busi to transact with him ill bring him
to you and put him where you choos but for the present make up your
mind to consent to thi penanc and believ me it will be veri good
for you for soul as well for bodyfor your soul becaus of the chariti
with which you perform it for your bodi becaus i know that you ar of
a sanguin habit and it will do you no harm to draw a littl blood
there ar a great mani doctor in the world even the enchant ar
doctor said sancho howev as everybodi tell me the same
thingthough i cant see it myselfi sai i am will to give myself
the three thousand three hundr lash provid i am to lai them on
whenev i like without ani fix of dai or time and ill try and
get out of debt as quickli as i can that the world mai enjoi the
beauti of the ladi dulcinea del toboso as it seem contrari to what i
thought that she is beauti after all it must be a condit too
that i am not to be bound to draw blood with the scourg and that if
ani of the lash happen to be flyflapp thei ar to count item
that in case i should make ani mistak in the reckon seor merlin
as he know everyth is to keep count and let me know how mani ar
still want or over the number
there will be no need to let you know of ani over said merlin
becaus when you reach the full number the ladi dulcinea will at
onc and that veri instant be disench and will come in her
gratitud to seek out the worthi sancho and thank him and even reward
him for the good work so you have no caus to be uneasi about stripe
too mani or too few heaven forbid i should cheat anyon of even a hair
of hi head
well then in god hand be it said sancho in the hard case im
in i give in i sai i accept the penanc on the condit laid down
the instant sancho utter these last word the music of the clarion
struck up onc more and again a host of musket were discharg and
don quixot hung on sancho neck kiss him again and again on the
forehead and cheek the duchess and the duke express the greatest
satisfact the car began to move on and as it pass the fair

the duke had a majordomo of a veri faceti and sportiv turn and he
it wa that plai the part of merlin made all the arrang for
the late adventur compos the vers and got a page to repres
dulcinea and now with the assist of hi master and mistress he
got up anoth of the drollest and strangest contriv that can be
imagin
the duchess ask sancho the next dai if he had made a begin with
hi penanc task which he had to perform for the disenchant of
dulcinea he said he had and had given himself five lash overnight
the duchess ask him what he had given them with
he said with hi hand
that said the duchess is more like give oneself slap than
lash i am sure the sage merlin will not be satisfi with such
tender worthi sancho must make a scourg with claw or a
catonin tail that will make itself felt for it with blood that
letter enter and the releas of so great a ladi as dulcinea will not
be grant so cheapli or at such a paltri price and rememb sancho
that work of chariti done in a lukewarm and halfheart wai ar
without merit and of no avail
to which sancho repli if your ladyship will give me a proper
scourg or cord ill lai on with it provid it doe not hurt too
much for you must know boor as i am my flesh is more cotton than
hemp and it wont do for me to destroi myself for the good of anybodi
els
so be it by all mean said the duchess tomorrow ill give you a
scourg that will be just the thing for you and will accommod
itself to the tender of your flesh as if it wa it own sister

and did you write it yourself said the duchess
that i didnt said sancho for i can neither read nor write though

sancho drew out an open letter from hi bosom and the duchess take
it found it ran in thi fashion
sancho panza letter to hi wife teresa panza

thei had amus themselv for a while with sancho rich convers
the melancholi sound of a fife and harsh discord drum made itself
heard all seem somewhat put out by thi dull confus martial
harmoni especi don quixot who could not keep hi seat from pure
disquietud as to sancho it is needless to sai that fear drove him to
hi usual refug the side or the skirt of the duchess and inde and
in truth the sound thei heard wa a most dole and melancholi on
while thei were still in uncertainti thei saw advanc toward them
through the garden two men clad in mourn robe so long and flow
that thei trail upon the ground as thei march thei beat two great
drum which were likewis drape in black and besid them came the
fife player black and sombr like the other follow these came a
personag of gigant statur envelop rather than clad in a gown of

graviti and digniti and in short hi statur hi gait the

the duke and duchess were extrem glad to see how readili don quixot
fell in with their scheme but at thi moment sancho observ i hope
thi seora duenna wont be put ani difficulti in the wai of the
promis of my govern for i have heard a toledo apothecari who
talk like a goldfinch sai that where duenna were mix up noth
good could happen god bless me how he hate them that same
apothecari and so what im think is if all duenna of whatev
sort or condit thei mai be ar plagu and busybodi what must
thei be that ar distress like thi countess threeskirt or
threetailsfor in my countri skirt or tail tail or skirt it
all on
hush friend sancho said don quixot sinc thi ladi duenna come
in quest of me from such a distant land she cannot be on of those the
apothecari meant moreov thi is a countess and when countess
serv as duenna it is in the servic of queen and empress for in
their own hous thei ar mistress paramount and have other duenna
to wait on them
to thi doa rodriguez who wa present made answer my ladi the
duchess ha duenna in her servic that might be countess if it wa
the will of fortun but law go as king like let nobodi speak ill
of duenna abov all of ancient maiden on for though i am not on
myself i know and am awar of the advantag a maiden duenna ha over
on that is a widow but he who clip us ha kept the scissor
for all that said sancho there so much to be clip about
duenna so my barber said that it will be better not to stir the
rice even though it stick
these squir return doa rodriguez ar alwai our enemi and
as thei ar the haunt spirit of the antechamb and watch us at
everi step whenev thei ar not sai their prayer and that
often enough thei spend their time in tattl about us dig up
our bone and buri our good name but i can tell these walk
block that we will live in spite of them and in great hous too
though we die of hunger and cover our flesh be it delic or not
with widow weed as on cover or hide a dunghil on a process
dai by my faith if it were permit me and time allow i could
prove not onli to those here present but to all the world that there
is no virtu that is not to be found in a duenna
i have no doubt said the duchess that my good doa rodriguez is
right and veri much so but she had better bide her time for fight
her own battl and that of the rest of the duenna so as to crush the
calumni of that vile apothecari and root out the prejudic in the
great sancho panza mind
to which sancho repli ever sinc i have snif the governorship i
have got rid of the humour of a squir and i dont care a wild fig
for all the duenna in the world
thei would have carri on thi duenna disput further had thei not
heard the note of the fife and drum onc more from which thei
conclud that the distress duenna wa make her entranc the
duchess ask the duke if it would be proper to go out to receiv her
as she wa a countess and a person of rank
in respect of her be a countess said sancho befor the duke
could repli i am for your high go out to receiv her but in
respect of her be a duenna it is my opinion you should not stir a
step
who bade thee meddl in thi sancho said don quixot
who seor said sancho i meddl for i have a right to meddl as a
squir who ha learn the rule of courtesi in the school of your
worship the most courteou and bestbr knight in the whole world of
courtli and in these thing as i have heard your worship sai as
much is lost by a card too mani as by a card too few and to on who
ha hi ear open few word
sancho is right said the duke well see what the countess is like
and by that measur the courtesi that is due to her
and now the drum and fife made their entranc as befor and here the
author brought thi short chapter to an end and began the next
follow up the same adventur which is on of the most notabl in
the histori

hearer that will know how if not to remedi them to sympathis with

on hear thi the distress duenna made as though she would throw

said as she strove to embrac them befor these feet and leg i cast

the duke and duchess as it wa thei who had made the experi of
thi adventur were readi to burst with laughter at all thi and
between themselv thei commend the clever act of the trifaldi
who return to her seat said queen doa maguncia reign over the
famou kingdom of kandi which li between the great trapobana and the
southern sea two leagu beyond cape comorin she wa the widow of
king archipiela her lord and husband and of their marriag thei had
issu the princess antonomasia heiress of the kingdom which princess
antonomasia wa rear and brought up under my care and direct i
be the oldest and highest in rank of her mother duenna time
pass and the young antonomasia reach the ag of fourteen and such
a perfect of beauti that natur could not rais it higher then it
must not be suppos her intellig wa childish she wa as
intellig as she wa fair and she wa fairer than all the world and
is so still unless the enviou fate and hardheart sister three
have cut for her the thread of life but that thei have not for heaven
will not suffer so great a wrong to earth as it would be to pluck
unrip the grape of the fairest vineyard on it surfac of thi
beauti to which my poor feebl tongu ha fail to do justic
countless princ not onli of that countri but of other were
enamour and among them a privat gentleman who wa at the court
dare to rais hi thought to the heaven of so great beauti trust
to hi youth hi gallant bear hi numer accomplish and
grace and hi quick and readi of wit for i mai tell your
high if i am not weari you that he plai the guitar so as
to make it speak and he wa besid a poet and a great dancer and
he could make birdcag so well that by make them alon he might
have gain a livelihood had he found himself reduc to utter
poverti and gift and grace of thi kind ar enough to bring down a
mountain not to sai a tender young girl but all hi gallantri wit
and gaieti all hi grace and accomplish would have been of
littl or no avail toward gain the fortress of my pupil had not
the impud thief taken the precaut of gain me over first
first the villain and heartless vagabond sought to win my goodwil
and purchas my complianc so as to get me like a treacher warder
to deliv up to him the kei of the fortress i had in charg in a
word he gain an influenc over my mind and overcam my resolut
with i know not what trinket and jewel he gave me but it wa some
vers i heard him sing on night from a grate that open on the
street where he live that more than anyth els made me give wai
and led to my fall and if i rememb rightli thei ran thu
from that sweet enemi of mine
my bleed heart hath had it wound
and to increas the pain im bound
to suffer and to make no sign
the line seem pearl to me and hi voic sweet as syrup and
afterward i mai sai ever sinc then look at the misfortun into
which i have fallen i have thought that poet as plato advis ought
to be banish from all wellord state at least the amatori on
for thei write vers not like those of the marqui of mantua that
delight and draw tear from the women and children but sharppoint
conceit that pierc the heart like soft thorn and like the lightn
strike it leav the raiment uninjur anoth time he sang
come death so subtli veil that i
thy come know not how or when
lest it should give me life again
to find how sweet it is to die
and other vers and burden of the same sort such as enchant when
sung and fascin when written and then when thei condescend to
compos a sort of vers that wa at that time in vogu in kandi which
thei call seguidilla then it is that heart leap and laughter break
forth and the bodi grow restless and all the sens turn quicksilv
and so i sai sir that these troubadour richli deserv to be
banish to the isl of the lizard though it is not thei that ar in
fault but the simpleton that extol them and the fool that believ
in them and had i been the faith duenna i should have been hi
stale conceit would have never move me nor should i have been taken
in by such phrase as in death i live in ic i burn in flame i
shiver hopeless i hope i go and stai and paradox of that sort
which their write ar full of and then when thei promis the phnix
of arabia the crown of ariadn the hors of the sun the pearl of
the south the gold of tibar and the balsam of panchaia then it is
thei give a loos to their pen for it cost them littl to make
promis thei have no intent or power of fulfil but where am i
wander to woe is me unfortun be what mad or folli lead
me to speak of the fault of other when there is so much to be said
about my own again woe is me hapless that i am it wa not vers
that conquer me but my own simplic it wa not music made me
yield but my own imprud my own great ignor and littl caution
open the wai and clear the path for don clavijo advanc for
that wa the name of the gentleman i have refer to and so with my
help as gobetween he found hi wai mani a time into the chamber of
the deceiv antonomasia deceiv not by him but by me under the
titl of a law husband for sinner though i wa i would not have
allow him to approach the edg of her shoesol without be her
husband no no not that marriag must come first in ani busi of
thi sort that i take in hand but there wa on hitch in thi case
which wa that of inequ of rank don clavijo be a privat
gentleman and the princess antonomasia as i said heiress to the
kingdom the entangl remain for some time a secret kept hidden
by my cun precaut until i perceiv that a certain expans
of waist in antonomasia must befor long disclos it the dread of
which made us all there take counsel togeth and it wa agre that
befor the mischief came to light don clavijo should demand
antonomasia as hi wife befor the vicar in virtu of an agreement to
marri him made by the princess and draft by my wit in such bind
term that the might of samson could not have broken it the necessari
step were taken the vicar saw the agreement and took the ladi
confess she confess everyth in full and he order her into
the custodi of a veri worthi alguacil of the court
ar there alguacil of the court in kandi too said sancho at thi
and poet and seguidilla i swear i think the world is the same all
over but make hast seora trifaldi for it is late and i am dy

by everi word that sancho utter the duchess wa as much delight as
don quixot wa driven to desper he bade him hold hi tongu and
the distress on went on to sai at length after much question
and answer as the princess held to her stori without chang or
vari her previou declar the vicar gave hi decis in favour
of don clavijo and she wa deliv over to him as hi law wife
which the queen doa maguncia the princess antonomasia mother so
took to heart that within the space of three dai we buri her
she di no doubt said sancho
of cours said trifaldin thei dont buri live peopl in kandi
onli the dead
seor squir said sancho a man in a swoon ha been known to be
buri befor now in the belief that he wa dead and it struck me
that queen maguncia ought to have swoon rather than di becaus
with life a great mani thing come right and the princesss folli wa
not so great that she need feel it so keenli if the ladi had marri
some page of her or some other servant of the hous as mani anoth
ha done so i have heard sai then the mischief would have been past
cure but to marri such an eleg accomplish gentleman as ha been
just now describ to usinde inde though it wa a folli it wa
not such a great on as you think for accord to the rule of my
master hereand he wont allow me to liea of men of letter bishop
ar made so of gentlemen knight special if thei be errant king
and emperor mai be made
thou art right sancho said don quixot for with a knighterr
if he ha but two finger breadth of good fortun it is on the card
to becom the mightiest lord on earth but let seora the distress
on proce for i suspect she ha got yet to tell us the bitter part
of thi so far sweet stori
the bitter is inde to come said the countess and such bitter
that colocynth is sweet and oleand toothsom in comparison the
queen then be dead and not in a swoon we buri her and hardli
had we cover her with earth hardli had we said our last farewel

women in kandi that go about from hous to hous to remov down and
trim eyebrow and make cosmet for the us of the women but we the
duenna of my ladi would never let them in for most of them have a
flavour of agent that have ceas to be princip and if we ar not
reliev by seor don quixot we shall be carri to our grave with
beard
i will pluck out my own in the land of the moor said don quixot
if i dont cure your
at thi instant the trifaldi recov from her swoon and said the
chink of that promis valiant knight reach my ear in the midst of
my swoon and ha been the mean of reviv me and bring back my
sens and so onc more i implor you illustri errant indomit
sir to let your graciou promis be turn into deed
there shall be no delai on my part said don quixot bethink you
seora of what i must do for my heart is most eager to serv you
the fact is repli the distress on it is five thousand
leagu a coupl more or less from thi to the kingdom of kandi if
you go by land but if you go through the air and in a straight line
it is three thousand two hundr and twentyseven you must know too
that malambruno told me that whenev fate provid the knight our
deliver he himself would send him a steed far better and with less
trick than a posthors for he will be that same wooden hors on
which the valiant pierr carri off the fair magalona which said
hors is guid by a peg he ha in hi forehead that serv for a
bridl and fli through the air with such rapid that you would
fanci the veri devil were carri him thi hors accord to
ancient tradit wa made by merlin he lent him to pierr who wa
a friend of hi and who made long journei with him and as ha been
said carri off the fair magalona bear her through the air on it
haunch and make all who beheld them from the earth gape with
astonish and he never lent him save to those whom he love or
those who paid him well and sinc the great pierr we know of no on
have mount him until now from him malambruno stole him by hi
magic art and he ha him now in hi possess and make us of him
in hi journei which he constantli make through differ part of
the world he is here todai tomorrow in franc and the next dai in
potosi and the best of it is the said hors neither eat nor sleep
nor wear out shoe and goe at an ambl pace through the air
without wing so that he whom he ha mount upon him can carri a cup
full of water in hi hand without spill a drop so smoothli and
easili doe he go for which reason the fair magalona enjoi ride
him greatli
for go smoothli and easili said sancho at thi give me my
dappl though he cant go through the air but on the ground ill back
him against all the ambler in the world
thei all laugh and the distress on continu and thi same
hors if so be that malambruno is dispos to put an end to our
suffer will be here befor us er the night shall have advanc
half an hour for he announc to me that the sign he would give me
wherebi i might know that i had found the knight i wa in quest of
would be to send me the hors wherev he might be speedili and
promptli
and how mani is there room for on thi hors ask sancho
two said the distress on on in the saddl and the other on
the croup and gener these two ar knight and squir when there is
no damsel that be carri off
id like to know seora distress on said sancho what is the
name of thi hors
hi name said the distress on is not the same as bellerophon
hors that wa call pegasu or alexand the great call
bucephalu or orlando furioso the name of which wa brigliador nor
yet bayard the hors of reinaldo of montalvan nor frontino like
ruggiero nor boot or peritoa as thei sai the hors of the sun
were call nor is he call orelia like the hors on which the
unfortun rodrigo the last king of the goth rode to the battl
where he lost hi life and hi kingdom
ill bet said sancho that as thei have given him none of these
famou name of wellknown hors no more have thei given him the name
of my master rocinant which for be apt surpass all that have
been mention
that is true said the beard countess still it fit him veri
well for he is call clavileo the swift which name is in accord
with hi be made of wood with the peg he ha in hi forehead and
with the swift pace at which he travel and so as far as name goe
he mai compar with the famou rocinant
i have noth to sai against hi name said sancho but with what
sort of bridl or halter is he manag
i have said alreadi said the trifaldi that it is with a peg by
turn which to on side or the other the knight who ride him make
him go as he pleas either through the upper air or skim and
almost sweep the earth or els in that middl cours that is sought
and follow in all wellregul proceed
id like to see him said sancho but to fanci im go to mount
him either in the saddl or on the croup is to ask pear of the elm
tree a good joke inde i can hardli keep my seat upon dappl and on
a packsaddl softer than silk itself and here theyd have me hold on
upon haunch of plank without pad or cushion of ani sort gad i have
no notion of bruis myself to get rid of anyon beard let each on
shave himself as best he can im not go to accompani my master on
ani such long journei besid i cant give ani help to the shave of
these beard as i can to the disenchant of my ladi dulcinea
ye you can my friend repli the trifaldi and so much that
without you so i understand we shall be abl to do noth
in the king name exclaim sancho what have squir got to do
with the adventur of their master ar thei to have the fame of such
as thei go through and we the labour bodi o me if the historian
would onli sai such and such a knight finish such and such an
adventur but with the help of so and so hi squir without which it
would have been imposs for him to accomplish it but thei write
curtli don paralipomenon of the three star accomplish the
adventur of the six monster without mention such a person as hi
squir who wa there all the time just as if there wa no such be
onc more sir i sai my master mai go alon and much good mai it do
him and ill stai here in the compani of my ladi the duchess and
mayb when he come back he will find the ladi dulcinea affair ever
so much advanc for i mean in leisur hour and at idl moment to
give myself a spell of whip without so much as a hair to cover me
for all that you must go if it be necessari my good sancho said the
duchess for thei ar worthi folk who ask you and the face of these
ladi must not remain overgrown in thi wai becaus of your idl
fear that would be a hard case inde
in the king name onc more said sancho if thi charit work
were to be done for the sake of damsel in confin or
charitygirl a man might expos himself to some hardship but to
bear it for the sake of strip beard off duenna devil take it
id sooner see them all beard from the highest to the lowest and
from the most prudish to the most affect
you ar veri hard on duenna sancho my friend said the duchess
you inclin veri much to the opinion of the toledo apothecari but
inde you ar wrong there ar duenna in my hous that mai serv as
pattern of duenna and here is my doa rodriguez who will not allow
me to sai otherwis
your excel mai sai it if you like said the rodriguez for god
know the truth of everyth and whether we duenna ar good or bad
beard or smooth we ar our mother daughter like other women and
as god sent us into the world he know why he did and on hi merci i
reli and not on anybodi beard

don quixot i trust in heaven that it will look with kindli ey upon
your troubl for sancho will do as i bid him onli let clavileo come
and let me find myself face to face with malambruno and i am certain
no razor will shave you more easili than my sword shall shave
malambruno head off hi shoulder for god bear with the wick
but not for ever
ah exclaim the distress on at thi mai all the star of the
celesti region look down upon your great with benign ey
valiant knight and shed everi prosper and valour upon your heart
that it mai be the shield and safeguard of the abus and downtrodden
race of duenna detest by apothecari sneer at by squir and
made game of by page ill betid the jade that in the flower of her
youth would not sooner becom a nun than a duenna unfortun be
that we ar we duenna though we mai be descend in the direct male

and now night came and with it the appoint time for the arriv of
the famou hors clavileo the nonappear of which wa alreadi
begin to make don quixot uneasi for it struck him that as
malambruno wa so long about send it either he himself wa not the
knight for whom the adventur wa reserv or els malambruno did not
dare to meet him in singl combat but lo suddenli there came into the
garden four wildmen all clad in green ivi bear on their shoulder a
great wooden hors thei place it on it feet on the ground and on
of the wildmen said let the knight who ha heart for it mount thi
machin
here sancho exclaim i dont mount for neither have i the heart nor
am i a knight
and let the squir if he ha on continu the wildman take hi
seat on the croup and let him trust the valiant malambruno for by no
sword save hi nor by the malic of ani other shall he be assail
it is but to turn thi peg the hors ha in hi neck and he will bear
them through the air to where malambruno await them but lest the vast
elev of their cours should make them giddi their ey must be
cover until the hors neigh which will be the sign of their have
complet their journei
with these word leav clavileo behind them thei retir with easi
digniti the wai thei came as soon as the distress on saw the hors
almost in tear she exclaim to don quixot valiant knight the
promis of malambruno ha prove trustworthi the hors ha come our
beard ar grow and by everi hair in them all of us implor thee to
shave and shear us as it is onli mount him with thy squir and
make a happi begin with your new journei
that i will seora countess trifaldi said don quixot most gladli
and with right goodwil without stop to take a cushion or put on
my spur so as not to lose time such is my desir to see you and all
these duenna shave clean
that i wont said sancho with goodwil or badwil or ani wai at
all and if thi shave cant be done without my mount on the
croup my master had better look out for anoth squir to go with him
and these ladi for some other wai of make their face smooth im
no witch to have a tast for travel through the air what would my
island sai when thei heard their governor wa go stroll about
on the wind and anoth thing as it is three thousand and odd
leagu from thi to kandi if the hors tire or the giant take
huff well be half a dozen year get back and there wont be isl
or island in the world that will know me and so as it is a common
sai in delai there danger and when thei offer thee a heifer
run with a halter these ladi beard must excus me saint peter
is veri well in rome i mean i am veri well in thi hous where so
much is made of me and i hope for such a good thing from the master as
to see myself a governor
friend sancho said the duke at thi the island that i have
promis you is not a move on or on that will run awai it ha
root so deepli buri in the bowel of the earth that it will be no
easi matter to pluck it up or shift it from where it is you know as
well as i do that there is no sort of offic of ani import that is
not obtain by a bribe of some kind great or small well then that
which i look to receiv for thi govern is that you go with your
master don quixot and bring thi memor adventur to a conclus
and whether you return on clavileo as quickli as hi speed seem to
promis or advers fortun bring you back on foot travel as a
pilgrim from hostel to hostel and from inn to inn you will alwai find
your island on your return where you left it and your island with
the same eager thei have alwai had to receiv you as their
governor and my goodwil will remain the same doubt not the truth of
thi seor sancho for that would be grievous wrong my
disposit to serv you
sai no more seor said sancho i am a poor squir and not equal to
carri so much courtesi let my master mount bandag my ey and
commit me to god care and tell me if i mai commend myself to our
lord or call upon the angel to protect me when we go tower up
there
to thi the trifaldi made answer sancho you mai freeli commend
yourself to god or whom you will for malambruno though an enchant is
a christian and work hi enchant with great circumspect
take veri good care not to fall out with anyon
well then said sancho god and the most holi triniti of gaeta give
me help
sinc the memor adventur of the full mill said don quixot
i have never seen sancho in such a fright as now were i as
superstiti as other hi abject fear would caus me some littl
trepid of spirit but come here sancho for with the leav of
these gentl i would sai a word or two to thee in privat and
draw sancho asid among the tree of the garden and seiz both hi
hand he said thou seest brother sancho the long journei we have
befor us and god know when we shall return or what leisur or
opportun thi busi will allow us i wish thee therefor to
retir now to thy chamber as though thou wert go to fetch someth
requir for the road and in a trice give thyself if it be onli five
hundr lash on account of the three thousand three hundr to which
thou art bound it will be all to the good and to make a begin
with a thing is to have it half finish
by god said sancho but your worship must be out of your sens
thi is like the common sai you see me with child and you want me
a virgin just as im about to go sit on a bare board your
worship would have me score my backsid inde your worship is not
reason let us be off to shave these duenna and on our return i
promis on my word to make such hast to wipe off all that due as
will satisfi your worship i cant sai more
well i will comfort myself with that promis my good sancho
repli don quixot and i believ thou wilt keep it for inde
though stupid thou art veraci
im not voraci said sancho onli peckish but even if i wa a
littl still id keep my word
with thi thei went back to mount clavileo and as thei were about to
do so don quixot said cover thine ey sancho and mount for on
who send for us from land so far distant cannot mean to deceiv us
for the sake of the paltri glori to be deriv from deceiv person
who trust in him though all should turn out the contrari of what i
hope no malic will be abl to dim the glori of have undertaken thi
exploit
let us be off seor said sancho for i have taken the beard and
tear of these ladi deepli to heart and i shant eat a bit to relish
it until i have seen them restor to their former smooth mount
your worship and blindfold yourself for if i am to go on the croup
it is plain the rider in the saddl must mount first
that is true said don quixot and take a handkerchief out of hi
pocket he beg the distress on to bandag hi ey veri
carefulli but after have them bandag he uncov them again
sai if my memori doe not deceiv me i have read in virgil of the
palladium of troi a wooden hors the greek offer to the goddess
palla which wa big with arm knight who were afterward the
destruct of troi so it would be as well to see first of all what
clavileo ha in hi stomach
there is no occas said the distress on i will be bail for
him and i know that malambruno ha noth tricki or treacher about
him you mai mount without ani fear seor don quixot on my head be
it if ani harm befal you
don quixot thought that to sai anyth further with regard to hi
safeti would be put hi courag in an unfavour light and so
without more word he mount clavileo and tri the peg which
turn easili and as he had no stirrup and hi leg hung down he
look like noth so much as a figur in some roman triumph paint
or embroid on a flemish tapestri
much against the grain and veri slowli sancho proceed to mount
and after settl himself as well as he could on the croup found it
rather hard and not at all soft and ask the duke if it would be
possibl to oblig him with a pad of some kind or a cushion even if
it were off the couch of hi ladi the duchess or the bed of on of the
page as the haunch of that hors were more like marbl than wood
on thi the trifaldi observ that clavileo would not bear ani kind of
har or trap and that hi best plan would be to sit sidewai
like a woman as in that wai he would not feel the hard so much
sancho did so and bid them farewel allow hi ey to be
bandag but immedi afterward uncov them again and look
tenderli and tearfulli on those in the garden bade them help him in
hi present strait with plenti of paternost and av maria that god
might provid someon to sai as mani for them whenev thei found
themselv in a similar emerg
at thi don quixot exclaim art thou on the gallow thief or at
thy last moment to us piti entreati of that sort cowardli
spiritless creatur art thou not in the veri place the fair magalona
occupi and from which she descend not into the grave but to
becom queen of franc unless the histori lie and i who am here
besid thee mai i not put myself on a par with the valiant pierr
who press thi veri spot that i now press cover thine ey cover
thine ey abject anim and let not thy fear escap thy lip at
least in my presenc
blindfold me said sancho as you wont let me commend myself or be
commend to god is it ani wonder if i am afraid there is a region of
devil about here that will carri us off to peralvillo
thei were then blindfold and don quixot find himself settl to
hi satisfact felt for the peg and the instant he place hi
finger on it all the duenna and all who stood by lift up their
voic exclaim god guid thee valiant knight god be with thee
intrepid squir now now ye go cleav the air more swiftli than an
arrow now ye begin to amaz and astonish all who ar gaze at you
from the earth take care not to wobbl about valiant sancho mind
thou fall not for thy fall will be wors than that rash youth who
tri to steer the chariot of hi father the sun
as sancho heard the voic cling tightli to hi master and wind
hi arm round him he said seor how do thei make out we ar go
up so high if their voic reach us here and thei seem to be speak
quit close to us
dont mind that sancho said don quixot for as affair of thi
sort and flight like thi ar out of the common cours of thing you
can see and hear as much as you like a thousand leagu off but dont
squeez me so tight or thou wilt upset me and realli i know not what
thou hast to be uneasi or frighten at for i can safe swear i never
mount a smoothergo steed all the dai of my life on would fanci
we never stir from on place banish fear my friend for inde
everyth is go as it ought and we have the wind astern
that true said sancho for such a strong wind come against me on
thi side that it seem as if peopl were blow on me with a
thousand pair of bellow which wa the case thei were puf at him
with a great pair of bellow for the whole adventur wa so well
plan by the duke the duchess and their majordomo that noth wa
omit to make it perfectli success
don quixot now feel the blast said beyond a doubt sancho we
must have alreadi reach the second region of the air where the hail
and snow ar gener the thunder the lightn and the
thunderbolt ar engend in the third region and if we go on
ascend at thi rate we shall shortli plung into the region of
fire and i know not how to regul thi peg so as not to mount up
where we shall be burn
and now thei began to warm their face from a distanc with tow that
could be easili set on fire and extinguish again fix on the end of
a cane on feel the heat sancho said mai i die if we ar not
alreadi in that fire place or veri near it for a good part of my
beard ha been sing and i have a mind seor to uncov and see
whereabout we ar
do noth of the kind said don quixot rememb the true stori of
the licenti torralva that the devil carri fly through the air
ride on a stick with hi ey shut who in twelv hour reach rome
and dismount at torr di nona which is a street of the citi and saw
the whole sack and storm and the death of bourbon and wa back in
madrid the next morn where he gave an account of all he had seen
and he said moreov that as he wa go through the air the devil
bade him open hi ey and he did so and saw himself so near the bodi
of the moon so it seem to him that he could have laid hold of it
with hi hand and that he did not dare to look at the earth lest he
should be seiz with giddi so that sancho it will not do for us
to uncov ourselv for he who ha us in charg will be respons
for us and perhap we ar gain an altitud and mount up to
enabl us to descend at on swoop on the kingdom of kandi as the saker
or falcon doe on the heron so as to seiz it howev high it mai
soar and though it seem to us not half an hour sinc we left the
garden believ me we must have travel a great distanc
i dont know how that mai be said sancho all i know is that if the
seora magallan or magalona wa satisfi with thi croup she could
not have been veri tender of flesh
the duke the duchess and all in the garden were listen to the
convers of the two hero and were beyond measur amus by it
and now desir of put a finish touch to thi rare and
wellcontriv adventur thei appli a light to clavileo tail with
some tow and the hors be full of squib and cracker immedi
blew up with a prodigi nois and brought don quixot and sancho
panza to the ground half sing by thi time the beard band of
duenna the trifaldi and all had vanish from the garden and those
that remain lai stretch on the ground as if in a swoon don quixot
and sancho got up rather shaken and look about them were fill
with amaz at find themselv in the same garden from which thei
had start and see such a number of peopl stretch on the
ground and their astonish wa increas when at on side of the
garden thei perceiv a tall lanc plant in the ground and hang
from it by two cord of green silk a smooth white parchment on which
there wa the follow inscript in larg gold letter the
illustri knight don quixot of la mancha ha by mere attempt
it finish and conclud the adventur of the countess trifaldi
otherwis call the distress duenna malambruno is now satisfi on
everi point the chin of the duenna ar now smooth and clean and
king don clavijo and queen antonomasia in their origin form and when
the squir flagel shall have been complet the white dove
shall find herself deliv from the pestifer gerfalcon that
persecut her and in the arm of her belov mate for such is the
decre of the sage merlin archenchant of enchant
as soon as don quixot had read the inscript on the parchment he
perceiv clearli that it refer to the disenchant of dulcinea
and return hearti thank to heaven that he had with so littl danger
achiev so grand an exploit as to restor to their former complexion
the counten of those vener duenna he advanc toward the
duke and duchess who had not yet come to themselv and take the
duke by the hand he said be of good cheer worthi sir be of good
cheer it noth at all the adventur is now over and without ani
harm done as the inscript fix on thi post show plainli
the duke came to himself slowli and like on recov conscious
after a heavi sleep and the duchess and all who had fallen prostrat
about the garden did the same with such demonstr of wonder and
amaz that thei would have almost persuad on that what thei
pretend so adroitli in jest had happen to them in realiti the duke
read the placard with halfshut ey and then ran to embrac don
quixot with open arm declar him to be the best knight that had
ever been seen in ani ag sancho kept look about for the distress
on to see what her face wa like without the beard and if she wa as
fair as her eleg person promis but thei told him that the
instant clavileo descend flame through the air and came to the
ground the whole band of duenna with the trifaldi vanish and that
thei were alreadi shave and without a stump left
the duchess ask sancho how he had fare on that long journei to
which sancho repli i felt seora that we were fly through the
region of fire as my master told me and i want to uncov my ey
for a bit but my master when i ask leav to uncov myself would
not let me but as i have a littl bit of curios about me and a
desir to know what is forbidden and kept from me quietli and without
anyon see me i drew asid the handkerchief cover my ey ever so
littl close to my nose and from underneath look toward the earth
and it seem to me that it wa altogeth no bigger than a grain of
mustard seed and that the men walk on it were littl bigger than
hazel nut so you mai see how high we must have got to then
to thi the duchess said sancho my friend mind what you ar sai
it seem you could not have seen the earth but onli the men walk on
it for if the earth look to you like a grain of mustard seed and
each man like a hazel nut on man alon would have cover the whole
earth
that is true said sancho but for all that i got a glimps of a bit
of on side of it and saw it all
take care sancho said the duchess with a bit of on side on doe
not see the whole of what on look at
i dont understand that wai of look at thing said sancho i
onli know that your ladyship will do well to bear in mind that as we
were fly by enchant so i might have seen the whole earth and all
the men by enchant whatev wai i look and if you wont believ
thi no more will you believ that uncov myself nearli to the
eyebrow i saw myself so close to the sky that there wa not a palm
and a half between me and it and by everyth that i can swear by
seora it is mighti great and it so happen we came by where the
seven goat ar and by god and upon my soul as in my youth i wa a
goatherd in my own countri as soon as i saw them i felt a long to
be among them for a littl and if i had not given wai to it i think
id have burst so i come and take and what do i do without sai
anyth to anybodi not even to my master softli and quietli i got
down from clavileo and amus myself with the goatswhich ar like
violet like flowersfor nigh threequart of an hour and clavileo
never stir or move from on spot
and while the good sancho wa amus himself with the goat said
the duke how did seor don quixot amus himself
to which don quixot repli as all these thing and such like
occurr ar out of the ordinari cours of natur it is no wonder
that sancho sai what he doe for my own part i can onli sai that i
did not uncov my ey either abov or below nor did i see sky or
earth or sea or shore it is true i felt that i wa pass through the
region of the air and even that i touch that of fire but that we
pass farther i cannot believ for the region of fire be between
the heaven of the moon and the last region of the air we could not
have reach that heaven where the seven goat sancho speak of ar
without be burn and as we were not burn either sancho is ly
or sancho is dream
i am neither ly nor dream said sancho onli ask me the token
of those same goat and youll see by that whether im tell the
truth or not
tell us them then sancho said the duchess
two of them said sancho ar green two bloodr two blue and
on a mixtur of all colour
an odd sort of goat that said the duke in thi earthli region of
our we have no such colour i mean goat of such colour
that veri plain said sancho of cours there must be a differ
between the goat of heaven and the goat of the earth
tell me sancho said the duke did you see ani hegoat among those
goat
no seor said sancho but i have heard sai that none ever pass
the horn of the moon
thei did not care to ask him anyth more about hi journei for thei
saw he wa in the vein to go rambl all over the heaven give an
account of everyth that went on there without have ever stir
from the garden such in short wa the end of the adventur of the
distress duenna which gave the duke and duchess laugh matter not
onli for the time be but for all their live and sancho someth
to talk about for ag if he live so long but don quixot come
close to hi ear said to him sancho as you would have us believ
what you saw in heaven i requir you to believ me as to what i saw in
the cave of montesino i sai no more

the duke and duchess were so well pleas with the success and droll
result of the adventur of the distress on that thei resolv to
carri on the joke see what a fit subject thei had to deal with for
make it all pass for realiti so have laid their plan and given
instruct to their servant and vassal how to behav to sancho in
hi govern of the promis island the next dai that follow
clavileo flight the duke told sancho to prepar and get readi to go
and be governor for hi island were alreadi look out for him as
for the shower of mai
sancho made him an obeis and said ever sinc i came down from
heaven and from the top of it beheld the earth and saw how littl it
is the great desir i had to be a governor ha been partli cool in
me for what is there grand in be ruler on a grain of mustard seed
or what digniti or author in govern half a dozen men about as big
as hazel nut for so far as i could see there were no more on the
whole earth if your lordship would be so good as to give me ever so
small a bit of heaven were it no more than half a leagu id rather
have it than the best island in the world
recollect sancho said the duke i cannot give a bit of heaven no
not so much as the breadth of my nail to anyon reward and favour
of that sort ar reserv for god alon what i can give i give you
and that is a real genuin island compact well proport and
uncommonli fertil and fruit where if you know how to us your
opportun you mai with the help of the world rich gain those
of heaven
well then said sancho let the island come and ill try and be
such a governor that in spite of scoundrel ill go to heaven and
it not from ani crave to quit my own humbl condit or better
myself but from the desir i have to try what it tast like to be a
governor
if you onc make trial of it sancho said the duke youll eat your
finger off after the govern so sweet a thing is it to command and
be obei depend upon it when your master come to be emperor as he
will beyond a doubt from the cours hi affair ar take it will be
no easi matter to wrest the digniti from him and he will be sore and
sorri at heart to have been so long without becom on
seor said sancho it is my belief it a good thing to be in
command if it onli over a drove of cattl
mai i be buri with you sancho said the duke but you know
everyth i hope you will make as good a governor as your sagac
promis and that is all i have to sai and now rememb tomorrow is
the dai you must set out for the govern of the island and thi
even thei will provid you with the proper attir for you to wear
and all thing requisit for your departur
let them dress me as thei like said sancho howev im dress
ill be sancho panza
that true said the duke but on dress must be suit to the
offic or rank on hold for it would not do for a jurist to dress
like a soldier or a soldier like a priest you sancho shall go
partli as a lawyer partli as a captain for in the island i am give
you arm ar need as much as letter and letter as much as arm
of letter i know but littl said sancho for i dont even know the
a b c but it is enough for me to have the christu in my memori to be
a good governor as for arm ill handl those thei give me till i
drop and then god be my help
with so good a memori said the duke sancho cannot go wrong in
anyth
here don quixot join them and learn what pass and how soon
sancho wa to go to hi govern he with the duke permiss took
him by the hand and retir to hi room with him for the purpos of
give him advic as to how he wa to demean himself in hi offic as
soon as thei had enter the chamber he close the door after him and
almost by forc made sancho sit down besid him and in a quiet tone
thu address him i give infinit thank to heaven friend sancho
that befor i have met with ani good luck fortun ha come forward to
meet thee i who count upon my good fortun to discharg the
recompens of thy servic find myself still wait for advanc
while thou befor the time and contrari to all reason
expect seest thyself bless in the fulfil of thy desir
some will bribe beg solicit rise earli entreat persist without
attain the object of their suit while anoth come and without
know why or wherefor find himself invest with the place or
offic so mani have su for and here it is that the common sai
there is good luck as well as bad luck in suit appli thou who
to my think art beyond all doubt a dullard without earli rise or
night watch or take ani troubl with the mere breath of
knighterrantri that ha breath upon thee seest thyself without more
ado governor of an island as though it were a mere matter of cours
thi i sai sancho that thou attribut not the favour thou hast
receiv to thine own merit but give thank to heaven that dispos
matter benefic and secondli thank to the great power the
profess of knighterrantri contain in itself with a heart then
inclin to believ what i have said to thee attend my son to thy
cato here who would counsel thee and be thy polestar and guid to
direct and pilot thee to a safe haven out of thi stormi sea wherein
thou art about to ingulf thyself for offic and great trust ar
noth els but a mighti gulf of troubl
first of all my son thou must fear god for in the fear of him is
wisdom and be wise thou canst not err in aught
secondli thou must keep in view what thou art strive to know
thyself the most difficult thing to know that the mind can imagin if
thou knowest thyself it will follow thou wilt not puff thyself up like
the frog that strove to make himself as larg as the ox if thou dost
the recollect of have kept pig in thine own countri will serv as
the ugli feet for the wheel of thy folli
that the truth said sancho but that wa when i wa a boi
afterward when i wa someth more of a man it wa gees i kept not
pig but to my think that ha noth to do with it for all who
ar governor dont come of a kingli stock
true said don quixot and for that reason those who ar not of
nobl origin should take care that the digniti of the offic thei hold
be accompani by a gentl suaviti which wise manag will save them
from the sneer of malic that no station escap
glori in thy humbl birth sancho and be not asham of sai thou
art peasantborn for when it is seen thou art not asham no on will
set himself to put thee to the blush and pride thyself rather upon
be on of lowli virtu than a lofti sinner countless ar thei who
born of mean parentag have risen to the highest digniti pontif
and imperi and of the truth of thi i could give thee instanc
enough to weari thee
rememb sancho if thou make virtu thy aim and take a pride in
do virtuou action thou wilt have no caus to envi those who have
princ and lordli on for blood is an inherit but virtu an
acquisit and virtu ha in itself alon a worth that blood doe not
possess
thi be so if perchanc anyon of thy kinsfolk should come to see
thee when thou art in thine island thou art not to repel or slight
him but on the contrari to welcom him entertain him and make much
of him for in so do thou wilt be approv of heaven which is not
pleas that ani should despis what it hath made and wilt compli
with the law of wellord natur
if thou carriest thy wife with thee and it is not well for those that
administ govern to be long without their wive teach and
instruct her and strive to smooth down her natur rough for all
that mai be gain by a wise governor mai be lost and wast by a
boorish stupid wife
if perchanc thou art left a widowera thing which mai happenand in
virtu of thy offic seekest a consort of higher degre choos not on
to serv thee for a hook or for a fishingrod or for the hood of thy
wont have it for verili i tell thee for all the judg wife
receiv the husband will be held account at the gener call
to account where he will have repai in death fourfold item that in
life he regard as naught
never go by arbitrari law which is so much favour by ignor men
who plume themselv on clever
let the tear of the poor man find with thee more compass but not
more justic than the plead of the rich
strive to lai bare the truth as well amid the promis and present
of the rich man as amid the sob and entreati of the poor
when equiti mai and should be brought into plai press not the utmost
rigour of the law against the guilti for the reput of the stern
judg stand not higher than that of the compassion
if perchanc thou permittest the staff of justic to swerv let it be
not by the weight of a gift but by that of merci
if it should happen to thee to give judgment in the caus of on who
is thine enemi turn thy thought awai from thy injuri and fix them on
the justic of the case
let not thine own passion blind thee in anoth man caus for the
error thou wilt thu commit will be most frequent irremedi or
if not onli to be remedi at the expens of thy good name and even of
thy fortun
if ani handsom woman come to seek justic of thee turn awai thine
ey from her tear and thine ear from her lament and consid
deliber the merit of her demand if thou wouldst not have thy
reason swept awai by her weep and thy rectitud by her sigh
abus not by word him whom thou hast to punish in deed for the pain
of punish is enough for the unfortun without the addit of
thine objurg
bear in mind that the culprit who come under thy jurisdict is but
a miser man subject to all the propens of our deprav natur
and so far as mai be in thy power show thyself lenient and forbear
for though the attribut of god ar all equal to our ey that of
merci is brighter and loftier than that of justic
if thou followest these precept and rule sancho thy dai will be
long thy fame etern thy reward abund thy felic unutter
thou wilt marri thy children as thou wouldst thei and thy
grandchildren will bear titl thou wilt live in peac and concord
with all men and when life draw to a close death will come to thee
in calm and ripe old ag and the light and love hand of thy
greatgrandchildren will close thine ey
what i have thu far address to thee ar instruct for the
adorn of thy mind listen now to those which tend to that of the

of the second set of counsel don quixot gave sancho panza
p43ajpg 129k
full size
who hear the forego discours of don quixot would not have set
him down for a person of great good sens and greater rectitud of
purpos but as ha been frequent observ in the cours of thi
great histori he onli talk nonsens when he touch on chivalri and
in discuss all other subject show that he had a clear and
unbiass understand so that at everi turn hi act gave the lie to
hi intellect and hi intellect to hi act but in the case of these
second counsel that he gave sancho he show himself to have a live
turn of humour and displai conspicu hi wisdom and also hi
folli
sancho listen to him with the deepest attent and endeavour to
fix hi counsel in hi memori like on who meant to follow them and
by their mean bring the full promis of hi govern to a happi
issu don quixot then went on to sai
with regard to the mode in which thou shouldst govern thy person and
thy hous sancho the first charg i have to give thee is to be clean
and to cut thy nail not let them grow as some do whose ignor
make them fanci that long nail ar an ornament to their hand as if
those excresc thei neglect to cut were nail and not the talon
of a lizardcatch kestrela filthi and unnatur abus
go not ungirt and loos sancho for disord attir is a sign of an
unstabl mind unless inde the slovenli and slack is to be
set down to craft as wa the common opinion in the case of juliu
csar
ascertain cautious what thy offic mai be worth and if it will
allow thee to give liveri to thy servant give them respect and
servic rather than showi and gai on and divid them between
thy servant and the poor that is to sai if thou canst cloth six
page cloth three and three poor men and thu thou wilt have page
for heaven and page for earth the vainglori never think of thi
new mode of give liveri
eat not garlic nor onion lest thei find out thy boorish origin by
the smell walk slowli and speak deliber but not in such a wai as
to make it seem thou art listen to thyself for all affect is
bad
dine sparingli and sup more sparingli still for the health of the
whole bodi is forg in the workshop of the stomach
be temper in drink bear in mind that wine in excess keep
neither secret nor promis
take care sancho not to chew on both side and not to eruct in
anybodi presenc
eruct said sancho i dont know what that mean
to eruct sancho said don quixot mean to belch and that is on
of the filthiest word in the spanish languag though a veri
express on and therefor nice folk have had recours to the latin
and instead of belch sai eruct and instead of belch sai eruct
and if some do not understand these term it matter littl for custom
will bring them into us in the cours of time so that thei will be
readili understood thi is the wai a languag is enrich custom and
the public ar allpow there
in truth seor said sancho on of the counsel and caution i
mean to bear in mind shall be thi not to belch for im constantli
do it
eruct sancho not belch said don quixot
eruct i shall sai henceforth and i swear not to forget it said
sancho
likewis sancho said don quixot thou must not mingl such a
quantiti of proverb in thy discours as thou dost for though proverb
ar short maxim thou dost drag them in so often by the head and
shoulder that thei savour more of nonsens than of maxim
god alon can cure that said sancho for i have more proverb in me
than a book and when i speak thei come so thick togeth into my mouth
that thei fall to fight among themselv to get out that why my
tongu let fly the first that come though thei mai not be pat to the
purpos but ill take care henceforward to us such as befit the
digniti of my offic for in a hous where there plenti supper is
soon cook and he who bind doe not wrangl and the
bellring in a safe berth and give and keep requir
brain
that it sancho said don quixot pack tack string proverb
togeth nobodi is hinder thee my mother beat me and i go on
with my trick i am bid thee avoid proverb and here in a second
thou hast shot out a whole litani of them which have as much to do
with what we ar talk about as over the hill of beda mind
sancho i do not sai that a proverb aptli brought in is objection
but to pile up and string togeth proverb at random make
convers dull and vulgar
when thou ridest on horseback do not go loll with thy bodi on the
back of the saddl nor carri thy leg stiff or stick out from the
hors belli nor yet sit so loos that on would suppos thou wert
on dappl for the seat on a hors make gentlemen of some and groom
of other
be moder in thy sleep for he who doe not rise earli doe not get
the benefit of the dai and rememb sancho dilig is the mother
of good fortun and indol it opposit never yet attain the
object of an honest ambit
the last counsel i will give thee now though it doe not tend to
bodili improv i would have thee carri carefulli in thy memori
for i believ it will be no less us to thee than those i have given
thee alreadi and it is thisnev engag in a disput about famili
at least in the wai of compar them on with anoth for necessarili
on of those compar will be better than the other and thou wilt be
hate by the on thou hast disparag and get noth in ani shape
from the on thou hast exalt
thy attir shall be hose of full length a long jerkin and a cloak a
trifl longer loos breech by no mean for thei ar becom
neither for gentlemen nor for governor
for the present sancho thi is all that ha occur to me to advis
thee as time goe by and occas aris my instruct shall follow
if thou take care to let me know how thou art circumstanc
seor said sancho i see well enough that all these thing your
worship ha said to me ar good holi and profit but what us
will thei be to me if i dont rememb on of them to be sure that
about not let my nail grow and marri again if i have the
chanc will not slip out of my head but all that other hash muddl
and jumblei dont and cant recollect ani more of it than of last
year cloud so it must be given me in write for though i cant
either read or write ill give it to my confessor to drive it into me
and remind me of it whenev it is necessari
ah sinner that i am said don quixot how bad it look in
governor not to know how to read or write for let me tell thee
sancho when a man know not how to read or is lefthand it argu
on of two thing either that he wa the son of exceedingli mean and
lowli parent or that he himself wa so incorrig and
illcondit that neither good compani nor good teach could make
ani impress on him it is a great defect that thou labourest under
and therefor i would have thee learn at ani rate to sign thy name
i can sign my name well enough said sancho for when i wa steward
of the brotherhood in my villag i learn to make certain letter
like the mark on bale of good which thei told me made out my name
besid i can pretend my right hand is disabl and make someon els
sign for me for there a remedi for everyth except death and as
i shall be in command and hold the staff i can do as i like moreov
he who ha the alcald for hi father and ill be governor and
that higher than alcald onli come and see let them make light of
me and abus me theyll come for wool and go back shorn whom god
love hi hous is known to him the silli sai of the rich pass
for saw in the world and as ill be rich be a governor and at
the same time gener as i mean to be no fault will be seen in me
onli make yourself honei and the fli will suck you as much as
thou hast so much art thou worth as my grandmoth us to sai and
thou canst have no reveng of a man of substanc
oh god curs upon thee sancho here exclaim don quixot sixti
thousand devil fly awai with thee and thy proverb for the last hour
thou hast been string them togeth and inflict the pang of
tortur on me with everi on of them those proverb will bring thee to
the gallow on dai i promis thee thy subject will take the
govern from thee or there will be revolt among them tell me
where dost thou pick them up thou boobi how dost thou appli them
thou blockhead for with me to utter on and make it appli properli i
have to sweat and labour as if i were dig
by god master mine said sancho your worship is make a fuss
about veri littl why the devil should you be vex if i make us of
what is my own and i have got noth els nor ani other stock in
trade except proverb and more proverb and here ar three just thi
instant come into my head pat to the purpos and like pear in a
basket but i wont repeat them for sage silenc is call sancho
that sancho thou art not said don quixot for not onli art thou
not sage silenc but thou art pestil prate and pervers still i
would like to know what three proverb have just now come into thy
memori for i have been turn over mine ownand it is a good oneand
none occur to me
what can be better said sancho than never put thy thumb between
two back teeth and to get out of my hous and what do you want
with my wife there is no answer and whether the pitcher hit the
stone or the stone the pitcher it a bad busi for the pitcher
all which fit to a hair for no on should quarrel with hi governor
or him in author over him becaus he will come off the worst as he
doe who put hi finger between two back and if thei ar not back
teeth it make no differ so long as thei ar teeth and to
whatev the governor mai sai there no answer ani more than to get
out of my hous and what do you want with my wife and then as for
that about the stone and the pitcher a blind man could see that so
that he who see the mote in anoth ey had need to see the beam in
hi own that it be not said of himself the dead woman wa
frighten at the on with her throat cut and your worship know well
that the fool know more in hi own hous than the wise man in
anoth
nai sancho said don quixot the fool know noth either in hi
own hous or in anybodi els for no wise structur of ani sort can
stand on a foundat of folli but let us sai no more about it
sancho for if thou governest badli thine will be the fault and mine
the shame but i comfort myself with have done my duti in advis
thee as earnestli and as wise as i could and thu i am releas from
my oblig and my promis god guid thee sancho and govern thee
in thy govern and deliv me from the misgiv i have that thou
wilt turn the whole island upsid down a thing i might easili prevent
by explain to the duke what thou art and tell him that all that
fat littl person of thine is noth els but a sack full of proverb
and sauci
seor said sancho if your worship think im not fit for thi
govern i give it up on the spot for the mere black of the nail of
my soul is dearer to me than my whole bodi and i can live just as
well simpl sancho on bread and onion as governor on partridg
and capon and what more while were asleep were all equal great
and small rich and poor but if your worship look into it you will
see it wa your worship alon that put me on to thi busi of
govern for i know no more about the govern of island than a
buzzard and if there ani reason to think that becaus of my be a
governor the devil will get hold of me id rather go sancho to heaven
than governor to hell
by god sancho said don quixot for those last word thou hast
utter alon i consid thou deservest to be governor of a thousand
island thou hast good natur instinct without which no knowledg
is worth anyth commend thyself to god and try not to swerv in the
pursuit of thy main object i mean alwai make it thy aim and fix
purpos to do right in all matter that come befor thee for heaven
alwai help good intent and now let us go to dinner for i think
my lord and ladi ar wait for us

how sancho panza wa conduct to hi govern and of the strang
adventur that befel don quixot in the castl
p44ajpg 140k
full size
it is state thei sai in the true origin of thi histori that when
cide hamet came to write thi chapter hi interpret did not
translat it as he wrote itthat is as a kind of complaint the moor
made against himself for have taken in hand a stori so dry and of so
littl varieti as thi of don quixot for he found himself forc to
speak perpetu of him and sancho without ventur to indulg in
digress and episod more seriou and more interest he said
too that to go on mind hand pen alwai restrict to write upon
on singl subject and speak through the mouth of a few
charact wa intoler drudgeri the result of which wa never
equal to the author labour and that to avoid thi he had in the
first part avail himself of the devic of novel like the
illadvis curios and the captiv captain which stand as it
were apart from the stori the other ar given there be incid
which occur to don quixot himself and could not be omit he also
thought he sai that mani engross by the interest attach to the
exploit of don quixot would take none in the novel and pass them
over hastili or impati without notic the eleg and art of
their composit which would be veri manifest were thei publish by
themselv and not as mere adjunct to the craze of don quixot or the
simplic of sancho therefor in thi second part he thought it
best not to insert novel either separ or interwoven but onli
episod someth like them aris out of the circumst the
fact present and even these sparingli and with no more word than
suffic to make them plain and as he confin and restrict himself to
the narrow limit of the narr though he ha abil capac
and brain enough to deal with the whole univers he request that hi
labour mai not be despis and that credit be given him not alon
for what he write but for what he ha refrain from write
and so he goe on with hi stori sai that the dai don quixot gave
the counsel to sancho the same afternoon after dinner he hand them
to him in write so that he might get someon to read them to him
thei had scarc howev been given to him when he let them drop
and thei fell into the hand of the duke who show them to the
duchess and thei were both amaz afresh at the mad and wit of don
quixot to carri on the joke then the same even thei despatch
sancho with a larg follow to the villag that wa to serv him for
an island it happen that the person who had him in charg wa a
majordomo of the duke a man of great discret and humourand there
can be no humour without discretionand the same who plai the part of
the countess trifaldi in the comic wai that ha been alreadi
describ and thu qualifi and instruct by hi master and
mistress as to how to deal with sancho he carri out their scheme
admir now it came to pass that as soon as sancho saw thi
majordomo he seem in hi featur to recognis those of the trifaldi
and turn to hi master he said to him seor either the devil
will carri me off here on thi spot righteou and believ or your
worship will own to me that the face of thi majordomo of the duke
here is the veri face of the distress on
don quixot regard the majordomo attent and have done so
said to sancho there is no reason why the devil should carri thee
off sancho either righteou or believingand what thou meanest by
that i know not the face of the distress on is that of the
majordomo but for all that the majordomo is not the distress on
for hi be so would involv a mighti contradict but thi is not
the time for go into question of the sort which would be involv
ourselv in an inextric labyrinth believ me my friend we must
prai earnestli to our lord that he deliv us both from wick wizard
and enchant
it is no joke seor said sancho for befor thi i heard him
speak and it seem exactli as if the voic of the trifaldi wa
sound in my ear well ill hold my peac but ill take care to be
on the lookout henceforth for ani sign that mai be seen to confirm or
do awai with thi suspicion
thou wilt do well sancho said don quixot and thou wilt let me
know all thou discoverest and all that befal thee in thy
govern
sancho at last set out attend by a great number of peopl he wa
dress in the garb of a lawyer with a gaban of tawni water camlet
over all and a montera cap of the same materi and mount a la
gineta upon a mule behind him in accord with the duke order
follow dappl with brand new asstrap and ornament of silk and
from time to time sancho turn round to look at hi ass so well
pleas to have him with him that he would not have chang place with
the emperor of germani on take leav he kiss the hand of the duke
and duchess and got hi master bless which don quixot gave him
with tear and he receiv blubber

let worthi sancho go in peac and good luck to him gentl reader and
look out for two bushel of laughter which the account of how he
behav himself in offic will give thee in the meantim turn thy
attent to what happen hi master the same night and if thou dost
not laugh thereat at ani rate thou wilt stretch thy mouth with a grin
for don quixot adventur must be honour either with wonder or
with laughter
it is record then that as soon as sancho had gone don quixot felt
hi loneli and had it been possibl for him to revok the mandat
and take awai the govern from him he would have done so the
duchess observ hi deject and ask him why he wa melancholi
becaus she said if it wa for the loss of sancho there were
squir duenna and damsel in her hous who would wait upon him to
hi full satisfact
the truth is seora repli don quixot that i do feel the loss
of sancho but that is not the main caus of my look sad and of all
the offer your excel make me i accept onli the goodwil with
which thei ar made and as to the remaind i entreat of your
excel to permit and allow me alon to wait upon myself in my
chamber
inde seor don quixot said the duchess that must not be four
of my damsel as beauti as flower shall wait upon you
to me said don quixot thei will not be flower but thorn to
pierc my heart thei or anyth like them shall as soon enter my
chamber as fly if your high wish to gratifi me still further
though i deserv it not permit me to pleas myself and wait upon
myself in my own room for i place a barrier between my inclin

short i will sleep in my cloth sooner than allow anyon to undress
me
sai no more seor don quixot sai no more said the duchess i
assur you i will give order that not even a fly not to sai a damsel
shall enter your room i am not the on to undermin the proprieti of
seor don quixot for it strike me that among hi mani virtu the
on that is preemin is that of modesti your worship mai undress
and dress in privat and in your own wai as you pleas and when you
pleas for there will be no on to hinder you and in your chamber you
will find all the utensil requisit to suppli the want of on who
sleep with hi door lock to the end that no natur need compel
you to open it mai the great dulcinea del toboso live a thousand

swear to your excel that in all my life i never mount a quieter
beast or a pleasant pace on than clavileo and i dont know what
could have induc malambruno to discard a steed so swift and so
gentl and burn it so recklessli as he did
probabl said the duchess repent of the evil he had done to the
trifaldi and compani and other and the crime he must have commit
as a wizard and enchant he resolv to make awai with all the
instrument of hi craft and so burn clavileo as the chief on and
that which mainli kept him restless wander from land to land and
by it ash and the trophi of the placard the valour of the great don

would not that my sing should lai bare my heart and that i should
be thought a light and wanton maiden by those who know not the mighti
power of love but come what mai better a blush on the cheek than a

ill swear that i gave them back and paid him realli and truli
the governor lower the staff and as he did so the old man who had
the stick hand it to the other old man to hold for him while he
swore as if he found it in hi wai and then laid hi hand on the
cross of the staff sai that it wa true the ten crown that were
demand of him had been lent him but that he had with hi own hand
given them back into the hand of the other and that he not
recollect it wa alwai ask for them
see thi the great governor ask the creditor what answer he had to
make to what hi oppon said he said that no doubt hi debtor had
told the truth for he believ him to be an honest man and a good
christian and he himself must have forgotten when and how he had given
him back the crown and that from that time forth he would make no
further demand upon him
the debtor took hi stick again and bow hi head left the court
observ thi and how without anoth word he made off and
observ too the resign of the plaintiff sancho buri hi head
in hi bosom and remain for a short space in deep thought with the
forefing of hi right hand on hi brow and nose then he rais hi
head and bade them call back the old man with the stick for he had
alreadi taken hi departur thei brought him back and as soon as
sancho saw him he said honest man give me that stick for i want
it
willingli said the old man here it is seor and he put it into
hi hand
sancho took it and hand it to the other old man said to him go
and god be with you for now you ar paid
i seor return the old man why is thi cane worth ten
goldcrown
ye said the governor or if not i am the greatest dolt in the
world now you will see whether i have got the headpiec to govern a
whole kingdom and he order the cane to be broken in two there in
the presenc of all it wa done and in the middl of it thei found
ten goldcrown all were fill with amaz and look upon their
governor as anoth solomon thei ask him how he had come to the
conclus that the ten crown were in the cane he repli that
observ how the old man who swore gave the stick to hi oppon
while he wa take the oath and swore that he had realli and truli
given him the crown and how as soon as he had done swear he ask
for the stick again it came into hi head that the sum demand must
be insid it and from thi he said it might be seen that god sometim
guid those who govern in their judgment even though thei mai be
fool besid he had himself heard the curat of hi villag mention
just such anoth case and he had so good a memori that if it wa not
that he forgot everyth he wish to rememb there would not be
such a memori in all the island to conclud the old men went off on
crestfallen and the other in high content all who were present
were astonish and he who wa record the word deed and
movement of sancho could not make up hi mind whether he wa to look
upon him and set him down as a fool or as a man of sens
as soon as thi case wa dispos of there came into court a woman
hold on with a tight grip to a man dress like a welltodo cattl
dealer and she came forward make a great outcri and exclaim
justic seor governor justic and if i dont get it on earth ill

keep myself as pure as a salamand in the fire or wool among the

it remain to be prove whether thi gallant ha clean hand or not
said sancho and turn to the man he ask him what he had to sai in
answer to the woman charg
he all in confus made answer sir i am a poor pig dealer and
thi morn i left the villag to sell save your presenc four
pig and between due and crib thei got out of me littl less

content laid hold of me and never let go until she brought me here
she sai i forc her but she li by the oath i swear or am readi to

the governor on thi ask him if he had ani monei in silver about him
he said he had about twenti ducat in a leather purs in hi bosom the
governor bade him take it out and hand it to the complain he obei
trembl the woman took it and make a thousand salaam to all and
prai to god for the long life and health of the seor governor who
had such regard for distress orphan and virgin she hurri out of

to see if the monei it contain wa silver
as soon as she wa gone sancho said to the cattl dealer whose tear
were alreadi start and whose ey and heart were follow hi
purs good fellow go after that woman and take the purs from her
by forc even and come back with it here and he did not sai it to
on who wa a fool or deaf for the man wa off like a flash of
lightn and ran to do as he wa bid
all the bystand wait anxious to see the end of the case and
present both man and woman came back at even closer grip than
befor she with her petticoat up and the purs in the lap of it and
he struggl hard to take it from her but all to no purpos so stout
wa the woman defenc she all the while cry out justic from
god and the world see here seor governor the shameless and
bold of thi villain who in the middl of the town in the middl
of the street want to take from me the purs your worship bade him
give me
and did he take it ask the governor

than the purs a pretti child id be it anoth sort of cat thei

hammer mallet and chisel would not get it out of my grip no nor
lion claw the soul from out of my bodi first
she is right said the man i own myself beaten and powerless i
confess i havent the strength to take it from her and he let go hi
hold of her
upon thi the governor said to the woman let me see that purs my
worthi and sturdi friend she hand it to him at onc and the
governor return it to the man and said to the unforc mistress of
forc sister if you had shown as much or onli half as much spirit
and vigour in defend your bodi as you have shown in defend that
purs the strength of hercul could not have forc you be off and
god speed you and bad luck to you and dont show your face in all
thi island or within six leagu of it on ani side under pain of two
hundr lash be off at onc i sai you shameless cheat shrew
the woman wa cow and went off disconsol hang her head and
the governor said to the man honest man go home with your monei and
god speed you and for the futur if you dont want to lose it see
that you dont take it into your head to yoke with anybodi the man
thank him as clumsili as he could and went hi wai and the
bystand were again fill with admir at their new governor
judgment and sentenc
next two men on appar a farm labour and the other a tailor
for he had a pair of shear in hi hand present themselv befor
him and the tailor said seor governor thi labour and i come
befor your worship by reason of thi honest man come to my shop
yesterdai for save everybodi presenc im a pass tailor god be
thank and put a piec of cloth into my hand and ask me
seor will there be enough in thi cloth to make me a cap measur
the cloth i said there would he probabl suspecteda i suppos and
i suppos rightthat i want to steal some of the cloth led to think
so by hi own rogueri and the bad opinion peopl have of tailor and
he told me to see if there would be enough for two i guess what he
would be at and i said ye he still follow up hi origin
unworthi notion went on ad cap after cap and i ye after ye
until we got as far as five he ha just thi moment come for them i
gave them to him but he wont pai me for the make on the contrari
he call upon me to pai him or els return hi cloth
is all thi true brother said sancho
ye repli the man but will your worship make him show the five
cap he ha made me
with all my heart said the tailor and draw hi hand from under
hi cloak he show five cap stuck upon the five finger of it and
said there ar the cap thi good man ask for and by god and upon
my conscienc i havent a scrap of cloth left and ill let the work be
examin by the inspector of the trade
all present laugh at the number of cap and the novelti of the suit
sancho set himself to think for a moment and then said it seem to
me that in thi case it is not necessari to deliv longwind
argument but onli to give offhand the judgment of an honest man and
so my decis is that the tailor lose the make and the labour the
cloth and that the cap go to the prison in the gaol and let there
be no more about it
if the previou decis about the cattl dealer purs excit the
admir of the bystand thi provok their laughter howev

attend at hi dinner and supper and allow him to eat what appear to
me to be fit for him and keep from him what i think will do him harm
and be injuri to hi stomach and therefor i order that plate of
fruit to be remov as be too moist and that other dish i order
to be remov as be too hot and contain mani spice that
stimul thirst for he who drink much kill and consum the radic
moistur wherein life consist
well then said sancho that dish of roast partridg there that
seem so savouri will not do me ani harm
to thi the physician repli of those my lord the governor shall not
eat so long as i live
why so said sancho
becaus repli the doctor our master hippocr the polestar
and beacon of medicin sai in on of hi aphor omni saturatio
mala perdici autem pessima which mean all replet is bad but
that of partridg is the worst of all
in that case said sancho let seor doctor see among the dish
that ar on the tabl what will do me most good and least harm and let
me eat it without tap it with hi stick for by the life of the
governor and so mai god suffer me to enjoi it but im dy of
hunger and in spite of the doctor and all he mai sai to deni me food
is the wai to take my life instead of prolong it
your worship is right seor governor said the physician and
therefor your worship i consid should not eat of those stew
rabbit there becaus it is a furri kind of food if that veal were
not roast and serv with pickl you might try it but it is out of
the question
that big dish that is smoke farther off said sancho seem to me
to be an olla podrida and out of the divers of thing in such
olla i cant fail to light upon someth tasti and good for me

absit said the doctor far from us be ani such base thought
there is noth in the world less nourish than an olla podrida to
canon or rector of colleg or peasant wed with your olla
podrida but let us have none of them on the tabl of governor
where everyth that is present should be delic and refin and
the reason is that alwai everywher and by everybodi simpl
medicin ar more esteem than compound on for we cannot go wrong
in those that ar simpl while in the compound we mai by mere
alter the quantiti of the thing compos them but what i am of
opinion the governor should eat now in order to preserv and fortifi
hi health is a hundr or so of wafer cake and a few thin slice of
conserv of quinc which will settl hi stomach and help hi
digest
sancho on hear thi threw himself back in hi chair and survei the
doctor steadili and in a solemn tone ask him what hi name wa and
where he had studi
he repli my name seor governor is doctor pedro recio de aguero i
am a nativ of a place call tirteafuera which li between caracuel
and almodvar del campo on the righthand side and i have the degre
of doctor from the univers of osuna
to which sancho glow all over with rage return then let doctor
pedro recio de malaguero nativ of tirteafuera a place that on the
righthand side as we go from caracuel to almodvar del campo graduat
of osuna get out of my presenc at onc or i swear by the sun ill
take a cudgel and by dint of blow begin with him ill not leav
a doctor in the whole island at least of those i know to be ignor
for as to learn wise sensibl physician them i will rever and
honour as divin person onc more i sai let pedro recio get out of
thi or ill take thi chair i am sit on and break it over hi
head and if thei call me to account for it ill clear myself by
sai i serv god in kill a bad doctora gener execution and
now give me someth to eat or els take your govern for a trade
that doe not feed it master is not worth two bean
the doctor wa dismai when he saw the governor in such a passion and
he would have made a tirteafuera out of the room but that the same
instant a posthorn sound in the street and the carver put hi
head out of the window turn round and said it a courier from my
lord the duke no doubt with some despatch of import
the courier came in all sweat and flurri and take a paper from
hi bosom place it in the governor hand sancho hand it to the
majordomo and bade him read the superscript which ran thu
to don sancho panza governor of the island of barataria into hi own
hand or those of hi secretari
sancho when he heard thi said which of you is my secretari i am
seor said on of those present for i can read and write and am a
biscayan with that addit said sancho you might be secretari
to the emperor himself open thi paper and see what it sai the
newborn secretari obei and have read the content said the matter
wa on to be discuss in privat sancho order the chamber to be
clear the majordomo and the carver onli remain so the doctor and
the other withdrew and then the secretari read the letter which wa
as follow
it ha come to my knowledg seor don sancho panza that certain
enemi of mine and of the island ar about to make a furiou attack
upon it some night i know not when it behov you to be on the alert
and keep watch that thei surpris you not i also know by trustworthi
spi that four person have enter the town in disguis in order to
take your life becaus thei stand in dread of your great capac
keep your ey open and take heed who approach you to address you
and eat noth that is present to you i will take care to send you
aid if you find yourself in difficulti but in all thing you will act
as mai be expect of your judgment from thi place the sixteenth of
august at four in the morn
your friend
the duke
sancho wa astonish and those who stood by made believ to be so
too and turn to the majordomo he said to him what we have got to
do first and it must be done at onc is to put doctor recio in the
lockup for if anyon want to kill me it is he and by a slow death
and the worst of all which is hunger
likewis said the carver it is my opinion your worship should not
eat anyth that is on thi tabl for the whole wa a present from
some nun and as thei sai behind the cross there the devil
i dont deni it said sancho so for the present give me a piec of
bread and four pound or so of grape no poison can come in them for
the fact is i cant go on without eat and if we ar to be prepar
for these battl that ar threaten us we must be well provis
for it is the tripe that carri the heart and not the heart the tripe
and you secretari answer my lord the duke and tell him that all hi
command shall be obei to the letter as he direct and sai from me
to my ladi the duchess that i kiss her hand and that i beg of her not
to forget to send my letter and bundl to my wife teresa panza by a
messeng and i will take it as a great favour and will not fail to
serv her in all that mai lie within my power and as you ar about it

order howev tell thi good man to come in but take care first of
all that he is not some spy or on of my assassin
no my lord said the page for he look like a simpl fellow and
either i know veri littl or he is as good as good bread

recio is not here to let me eat someth solid and substanti if it
were even a piec of bread and an onion

such forc that my husband gave a loud yell and writh fell to the
ground with hi ladi her two lacquei ran to rise her up and the
alcald and the alguacil did the same the guadalajara gate wa all in

howev fool boor and clown as he wa held hi own against them
all sai to those round him and to doctor pedro recio who as soon
as the privat busi of the duke letter wa dispos of had
return to the room now i see plainli enough that judg and
governor ought to be and must be made of brass not to feel the
importun of the applic that at all time and all season
insist on be heard and have their busi despatch and their
own affair and no other attend to come what mai and if the poor

seor doctor pedro recio tirteafuera here who would have me die of
hunger and declar that death to be life and the same sort of life
mai god give him and all hi kindi mean the bad doctor for the good

all who knew sancho panza were astonish to hear him speak so
elegantli and did not know what to attribut it to unless it were that
offic and grave respons either smarten or stupefi men wit
at last doctor pedro recio agil of tirteafuera promis to let him
have supper that night though it might be in contravent of all the
aphor of hippocr with thi the governor wa satisfi and
look forward to the approach of night and suppertim with great
anxieti and though time to hi mind stood still and made no
progress nevertheless the hour he so long for came and thei gave
him a beef salad with onion and some boil calv feet rather far
gone at thi he fell to with greater relish than if thei had given him
francolin from milan pheasant from rome veal from sorrento

them so long as it is good to eat and ill be oblig to him and
will requit him some dai but let nobodi plai prank on me for either
we ar or we ar not let us live and eat in peac and goodfellowship
for when god send the dawn he send it for all i mean to govern thi
island without give up a right or take a bribe let everyon keep
hi ey open and look out for the arrow for i can tell them the
devil in cantillana and if thei drive me to it theyll see
someth that will astonish them nai make yourself honei and the
fli eat you
of a truth seor governor said the carver your worship is in the
right of it in everyth you have said and i promis you in the name
of all the inhabit of thi island that thei will serv your worship
with all zeal affect and goodwil for the mild kind of
govern you have given a sampl of to begin with leav them no
ground for do or think anyth to your worship disadvantag
that i believ said sancho and thei would be great fool if thei
did or thought otherwis onc more i sai see to my feed and my
dappl for that is the great point and what is most to the purpos
and when the hour come let us go the round for it is my intent to
purg thi island of all manner of unclean and of all idl
goodfornoth vagabond for i would have you know that lazi idler
ar the same thing in a state as the drone in a hive that eat up the
honei the industri bee make i mean to protect the husbandman to
preserv to the gentleman hi privileg to reward the virtuou and
abov all to respect religion and honour it minist what sai you to
that my friend is there anyth in what i sai or am i talk to
no purpos
there is so much in what your worship sai seor governor said the
majordomo that i am fill with wonder when i see a man like your
worship entir without learn for i believ you have none at
all sai such thing and so full of sound maxim and sage remark
veri differ from what wa expect of your worship intellig by
those who sent us or by us who came here everi dai we see someth
new in thi world joke becom realiti and the joker find the
tabl turn upon them
night came and with the permiss of doctor pedro recio the governor
had supper thei then got readi to go the round and he start with
the majordomo the secretari the headcarv the chronicl charg
with record hi deed and alguacil and notari enough to form a
fairsiz squadron in the midst march sancho with hi staff as
fine a sight as on could wish to see and but a few street of the
town had been travers when thei heard a nois as of a clash of
sword thei hasten to the spot and found that the combat were
but two who see the author approach stood still and on of
them exclaim help in the name of god and the king ar men to be
allow to rob in the middl of thi town and rush out and attack
peopl in the veri street
be calm my good man said sancho and tell me what the caus of
thi quarrel is for i am the governor
said the other combat seor governor i will tell you in a veri
few word your worship must know that thi gentleman ha just now won
more than a thousand real in that gambl hous opposit and god
know how i wa there and gave more than on doubt point in hi
favour veri much against what my conscienc told me he made off with
hi win and when i made sure he wa go to give me a crown or
so at least by wai of a present as it is usual and customari to give
men of qualiti of my sort who stand by to see fair or foul plai and
back up swindl and prevent quarrel he pocket hi monei and left
the hous indign at thi i follow him and speak to him fairli
and civilli ask him to give me if it were onli eight real for he
know i am an honest man and that i have neither profess nor
properti for my parent never brought me up to ani or left me ani but
the rogu who is a greater thief than cacu and a greater sharper than
andradilla would not give me more than four real so your worship mai
see how littl shame and conscienc he ha but by my faith if you had
not come up id have made him disgorg hi win and hed have
learn what the rang of the steelyard wa
what sai you to thi ask sancho the other repli that all hi
antagonist said wa true and that he did not choos to give him more
than four real becaus he veri often gave him monei and that those
who expect present ought to be civil and take what is given them
with a cheer counten and not make ani claim against winner
unless thei know them for certain to be sharper and their win to
be unfairli won and that there could be no better proof that he
himself wa an honest man than hi have refus to give anyth for
sharper alwai pai tribut to lookerson who know them
that is true said the majordomo let your worship consid what is
to be done with these men
what is to be done said sancho is thi you the winner be you
good bad or indiffer give thi assail of your a hundr real
at onc and you must disburs thirti more for the poor prison and
you who have neither profess nor properti and hang about the island
in idl take these hundr real now and some time of the dai
tomorrow quit the island under sentenc of banish for ten year
and under pain of complet it in anoth life if you violat the
sentenc for ill hang you on a gibbet or at least the hangman will
by my order not a word from either of you or ill make him feel my
hand
the on paid down the monei and the other took it and the latter
quit the island while the other went home and then the governor
said either i am not good for much or ill get rid of these gambl
hous for it strike me thei ar veri mischiev
thi on at least said on of the notari your worship will not
be abl to get rid of for a great man own it and what he lose everi
year is beyond all comparison more than what he make by the card on
the minor gambl hous your worship mai exercis your power and it
is thei that do most harm and shelter the most barefac practic for
in the hous of lord and gentlemen of qualiti the notori sharper
dare not attempt to plai their trick and as the vice of gambl ha
becom common it is better that men should plai in hous of reput
than in some tradesman where thei catch an unlucki fellow in the
small hour of the morn and skin him aliv
i know alreadi notari that there is a good deal to be said on that
point said sancho
and now a tipstaff came up with a young man in hi grasp and said
seor governor thi youth wa come toward us and as soon as he
saw the offic of justic he turn about and ran like a deer a sure
proof that he must be some evildo i ran after him and had it not
been that he stumbl and fell i should never have caught him
what did you run for fellow said sancho
to which the young man repli seor it wa to avoid answer all
the question offic of justic put
what ar you by trade
a weaver
and what do you weav
lanc head with your worship good leav
your faceti with me you plume yourself on be a wag veri
good and where were you go just now
to take the air seor
and where doe on take the air in thi island
where it blow
good your answer ar veri much to the point you ar a smart youth
but take notic that i am the air and that i blow upon you astern
and send you to gaol ho there lai hold of him and take him off ill
make him sleep there tonight without air
by god said the young man your worship will make me sleep in gaol
just as soon as make me king
why shant i make thee sleep in gaol said sancho have i not the
power to arrest thee and releas thee whenev i like
all the power your worship ha said the young man wont be abl to
make me sleep in gaol
how not abl said sancho take him awai at onc where hell see
hi mistak with hi own ey even if the gaoler is will to exert
hi interest generos on hi behalf for ill lai a penalti of two
thousand ducat on him if he allow him to stir a step from the
prison
that ridicul said the young man the fact is all the men on
earth will not make me sleep in prison
tell me you devil said sancho have you got ani angel that will
deliv you and take off the iron i am go to order them to put
upon you
now seor governor said the young man in a sprightli manner let
us be reason and come to the point grant your worship mai order
me to be taken to prison and to have iron and chain put on me and
to be shut up in a cell and mai lai heavi penalti on the gaoler if
he let me out and that he obei your order still if i dont choos
to sleep and choos to remain awak all night without close an ey
will your worship with all your power be abl to make me sleep if i
dont choos
no truli said the secretari and the fellow ha made hi point
so then said sancho it would be entir of your own choic you
would keep from sleep not in opposit to my will
no seor said the youth certainli not
well then go and god be with you said sancho be off home to
sleep and god give you sound sleep for i dont want to rob you of it
but for the futur let me advis you dont joke with the author
becaus you mai come across someon who will bring down the joke on
your own skull
the young man went hi wai and the governor continu hi round and
shortli afterward two tipstaff came up with a man in custodi and
said seor governor thi person who seem to be a man is not so
but a woman and not an illfavour on in man cloth thei
rais two or three lantern to her face and by their light thei
distinguish the featur of a woman to all appear of the ag of
sixteen or a littl more with her hair gather into a gold and green
silk net and fair as a thousand pearl thei scan her from head to
foot and observ that she had on red silk stock with garter of
white taffeti border with gold and pearl her breech were of green
and gold stuff and under an open jacket or jerkin of the same she wore
a doublet of the finest white and gold cloth her shoe were white and
such as men wear she carri no sword at her belt but onli a richli
ornament dagger and on her finger she had sever handsom ring
in short the girl seem fair to look at in the ey of all and none
of those who beheld her knew her the peopl of the town said thei
could not imagin who she wa and those who were in on the secret of
the joke that were to be practis upon sancho were the on who were
most surpris for thi incid or discoveri had not been arrang by
them and thei watch anxious to see how the affair would end
sancho wa fascin by the girl beauti and he ask her who she
wa where she wa go and what had induc her to dress herself in
that garb she with her ey fix on the ground answer in modest
confus i cannot tell you seor befor so mani peopl what it is
of such consequ to me to have kept secret on thing i wish to be
known that i am no thief or evildo but onli an unhappi maiden whom
the power of jealousi ha led to break through the respect that is due
to modesti
hear thi the majordomo said to sancho make the peopl stand back
seor governor that thi ladi mai sai what she wish with less
embarrass
sancho gave the order and all except the majordomo the headcarv
and the secretari fell back find herself then in the presenc of no
more the damsel went on to sai i am the daughter sir of pedro
perez mazorca the woolfarm of thi town who is in the habit of
come veri often to my father hous
that wont do seora said the majordomo for i know pedro perez
veri well and i know he ha no child at all either son or daughter
and besid though you sai he is your father you add then that he
come veri often to your father hous
i had alreadi notic that said sancho
i am confus just now sir said the damsel and i dont know what
i am sai but the truth is that i am the daughter of diego de la
llana whom you must all know
ay that will do said the majordomo for i know diego de la llana
and know that he is a gentleman of posit and a rich man and that he
ha a son and a daughter and that sinc he wa left a widow nobodi
in all thi town can speak of have seen hi daughter face for he
keep her so close shut up that he doe not give even the sun a
chanc of see her and for all that report sai she is extrem
beauti
it is true said the damsel and i am that daughter whether report
li or not as to my beauti you sir will have decid by thi time
as you have seen me and with thi she began to weep bitterli
on see thi the secretari leant over to the headcarv ear and
said to him in a low voic someth seriou ha no doubt happen
thi poor maiden that she goe wander from home in such a dress and
at such an hour and on of her rank too there can be no doubt about
it return the carver and moreov her tear confirm your
suspicion sancho gave her the best comfort he could and entreat
her to tell them without ani fear what had happen her as thei would
all earnestli and by everi mean in their power endeavour to reliev
her
the fact is sir said she that my father ha kept me shut up
these ten year for so long is it sinc the earth receiv my mother
mass is said at home in a sumptuou chapel and all thi time i have
seen but the sun in the heaven by dai and the moon and the star by
night nor do i know what street ar like or plaza or church or
even men except my father and a brother i have and pedro perez the
woolfarm whom becaus he came frequent to our hous i took it
into my head to call my father to avoid name my own thi seclus
and the restrict laid upon my go out were it onli to church
have been keep me unhappi for mani a dai and month past i long to
see the world or at least the town where i wa born and it did not
seem to me that thi wish wa inconsist with the respect maiden of
good qualiti should have for themselv when i heard them talk of
bullfight take place and of javelin game and of act plai i
ask my brother who is a year younger than myself to tell me what
sort of thing these were and mani more that i had never seen he
explain them to me as well as he could but the onli effect wa to
kindl in me a still stronger desir to see them at last to cut short
the stori of my ruin i beg and entreat my brothero that i had
never made such an entreati and onc more she gave wai to a burst of
weep
proce seora said the majordomo and finish your stori of what
ha happen to you for your word and tear ar keep us all in
suspens
i have but littl more to sai though mani a tear to shed said the
damsel for illplac desir can onli be paid for in some such wai
the maiden beauti had made a deep impress on the headcarv
heart and he again rais hi lantern for anoth look at her and
thought thei were not tear she wa shed but seedpearl or dew of
the meadow nai he exalt them still higher and made orient pearl
of them and fervent hope her misfortun might not be so great a on
as her tear and sob seem to indic the governor wa lose
patienc at the length of time the girl wa take to tell her stori
and told her not to keep them wait ani longer for it wa late and
there still remain a good deal of the town to be gone over
she with broken sob and halfsuppress sigh went on to sai my
misfortun my misadventur is simpli thi that i entreat my
brother to dress me up as a man in a suit of hi cloth and take me
some night when our father wa asleep to see the whole town he
overcom by my entreati consent and dress me in thi suit and
himself in cloth of mine that fit him as if made for him for he
ha not a hair on hi chin and might pass for a veri beauti young
girl tonight about an hour ago more or less we left the hous
and guid by our youth and foolish impuls we made the circuit of
the whole town and then as we were about to return home we saw a
great troop of peopl come and my brother said to me sister thi
must be the round stir your feet and put wing to them and follow me
as fast as you can lest thei recognis us for that would be a bad
busi for us and so sai he turn about and began i cannot sai
to run but to fly in less than six pace i fell from fright and then
the offic of justic came up and carri me befor your worship
where i find myself put to shame befor all these peopl as whimsic
and viciou
so then seora said sancho no other mishap ha befallen you nor
wa it jealousi that made you leav home as you said at the begin
of your stori
noth ha happen me said she nor wa it jealousi that brought
me out but mere a long to see the world which did not go beyond
see the street of thi town
the appear of the tipstaff with her brother in custodi whom on
of them had overtaken as he ran awai from hi sister now fulli
confirm the truth of what the damsel said he had noth on but a
rich petticoat and a short blue damask cloak with fine gold lace and
hi head wa uncov and adorn onli with it own hair which look
like ring of gold so bright and curli wa it the governor the
majordomo and the carver went asid with him and unheard by hi
sister ask him how he came to be in that dress and he with no less
shame and embarrass told exactli the same stori as hi sister to
the great delight of the enamour carver the governor howev said
to them in truth young ladi and gentleman thi ha been a veri
childish affair and to explain your folli and rash there wa no
necess for all thi delai and all these tear and sigh for if you
had said we ar soandso and we escap from our father hous in
thi wai in order to rambl about out of mere curios and with no
other object there would have been an end of the matter and none of
these littl sob and tear and all the rest of it
that is true said the damsel but you see the confus i wa in
wa so great it did not let me behav as i ought
no harm ha been done said sancho come we will leav you at your
father hous perhap thei will not have miss you and anoth time
dont be so childish or eager to see the world for a respect
damsel should have a broken leg and keep at home and the woman and the
hen by gad about ar soon lost and she who is eager to see is also
eager to be seen i sai no more
the youth thank the governor for hi kind offer to take them home
and thei direct their step toward the hous which wa not far off
on reach it the youth threw a pebbl up at a grate and
immedi a womanserv who wa wait for them came down and
open the door to them and thei went in leav the parti marvel
as much at their grace and beauti as at the fanci thei had for see
the world by night and without quit the villag which howev
thei set down to their youth
the headcarv wa left with a heart pierc through and through and
he made up hi mind on the spot to demand the damsel in marriag of her
father on the morrow make sure she would not be refus him as he
wa a servant of the duke and even to sancho idea and scheme of
marri the youth to hi daughter sanchica suggest themselv and
he resolv to open the negoti at the proper season persuad
himself that no husband could be refus to a governor daughter and
so the night round came to an end and a coupl of dai later the
govern wherebi all hi plan were overthrown and swept awai as
will be seen farther on

the mad is onli thi said she that these ar the letter of
duchess and governor and these i have on my neck ar fine coral
bead with avemaria and paternost of beaten gold and i am a
gover
god help us said the curat we dont understand you teresa or
know what you ar talk about
there you mai see it yourselv said teresa and she hand them
the letter
the curat read them out for samson carrasco to hear and samson and he
regard on anoth with look of astonish at what thei had read
and the bachelor ask who had brought the letter teresa in repli
bade them come with her to her hous and thei would see the messeng
a most eleg youth who had brought anoth present which wa worth
as much more the curat took the coral bead from her neck and
examin them again and again and have satisfi himself as to their
fine he fell to wonder afresh and said by the gown i wear i
dont know what to sai or think of these letter and present on the
on hand i can see and feel the fine of these coral bead and on
the other i read how a duchess send to beg for a coupl of dozen of
acorn
squar that if you can said carrasco well let go and see the
messeng and from him well learn someth about thi mysteri that
ha turn up
thei did so and teresa return with them thei found the page sift
a littl barlei for hi hors and sanchica cut a rasher of bacon
to be pave with egg for hi dinner hi look and hi handsom
apparel pleas them both greatli and after thei had salut him
courteous and he them samson beg him to give them hi new as
well of don quixot as of sancho panza for he said though thei had
read the letter from sancho and her ladyship the duchess thei were
still puzzl and could not make out what wa meant by sancho
govern and abov all of an island when all or most of those in
the mediterranean belong to hi majesti
to thi the page repli as to seor sancho panza be a governor
there is no doubt whatev but whether it is an island or not that he
govern with that i have noth to do suffic it that it is a town
of more than a thousand inhabit with regard to the acorn i mai
tell you my ladi the duchess is so unpretend and unassum that
not to speak of send to beg for acorn from a peasant woman she ha
been known to send to ask for the loan of a comb from on of her
neighbour for i would have your worship know that the ladi of
aragon though thei ar just as illustri ar not so punctili and
haughti as the castilian ladi thei treat peopl with greater
familiar
in the middl of thi convers sanchica came in with her skirt full
of egg and said she to the page tell me seor doe my father wear
trunkhos sinc he ha been governor
i have not notic said the page but no doubt he wear them
ah my god said sanchica what a sight it must be to see my father
in tight isnt it odd that ever sinc i wa born i have had a long
to see my father in trunkhos
as thing go you will see that if you live said the page by god he
is in the wai to take the road with a sunshad if the govern onli
last him two month more
the curat and the bachelor could see plainli enough that the page
spoke in a waggish vein but the fine of the coral bead and the
hunt suit that sancho sent for teresa had alreadi shown it to them
did awai with the impress and thei could not help laugh at
sanchica wish and still more when teresa said seor curat look
about if there anybodi here go to madrid or toledo to bui me a
hoop petticoat a proper fashion on of the best qualiti for
inde and inde i must do honour to my husband govern as well
as i can nai if i am put to it and have to ill go to court and set
a coach like all the world for she who ha a governor for her husband
mai veri well have on and keep on
and why not mother said sanchica would to god it were todai
instead of tomorrow even though thei were to sai when thei saw me
seat in the coach with my mother see that rubbish that
garlicstuf fellow daughter how she goe stretch at her eas in
a coach as if she wa a shepop but let them tramp through the mud
and let me go in my coach with my feet off the ground bad luck to
backbit all over the world let me go warm and the peopl mai
laugh do i sai right mother
to be sure you do my child said teresa and all thi good luck
and even more my good sancho foretold me and thou wilt see my
daughter he wont stop till he ha made me a countess for to make a
begin is everyth in luck and as i have heard thy good father
sai mani a time for besid be thy father he the father of
proverb too when thei offer thee a heifer run with a halter when
thei offer thee a govern take it when thei would give thee a
counti seiz it when thei sai here here to thee with someth
good swallow it oh no go to sleep and dont answer the stroke of
good fortun and the lucki chanc that ar knock at the door of
your hous
and what do i care ad sanchica whether anybodi sai when he
see me hold my head up the dog saw himself in hempen breech
and the rest of it
hear thi the curat said i do believ that all thi famili of the
panza ar born with a sack of proverb in their insid everi on
of them i never saw on of them that doe not pour them out at all
time and on all occas
that is true said the page for seor governor sancho utter them
at everi turn and though a great mani of them ar not to the purpos
still thei amus on and my ladi the duchess and the duke prais them
highli
then you still maintain that all thi about sancho govern is
true seor said the bachelor and that there actual is a duchess
who send him present and write to him becaus we although we have
handl the present and read the letter dont believ it and suspect
it to be someth in the line of our fellowtownsman don quixot who
fanci that everyth is done by enchant and for thi reason i
am almost readi to sai that id like to touch and feel your worship to
see whether you ar a mere ambassador of the imagin or a man of
flesh and blood
all i know sir repli the page is that i am a real ambassador
and that seor sancho panza is governor as a matter of fact and that
my lord and ladi the duke and duchess can give and have given him thi
same govern and that i have heard it said sancho panza bear
himself veri stoutli therein whether there be ani enchant in all
thi or not it is for your worship to settl between you for that
all i know by the oath i swear and that is by the life of my parent
whom i have still aliv and love dearli
it mai be so said the bachelor but dubitat augustinu
doubt who will said the page what i have told you is the truth
and that will alwai rise abov falsehood as oil abov water if not
operibu credit et non verbi let on of you come with me and he
will see with hi ey what he doe not believ with hi ear
it for me to make that trip said sanchica take me with you
seor behind you on your hors for ill go with all my heart to see
my father
governor daughter said the page must not travel along the road
alon but accompani by coach and litter and a great number of
attend
by god said sanchica i can go just as well mount on a sheass as
in a coach what a dainti lass you must take me for
hush girl said teresa you dont know what your talk about
the gentleman is quit right for as the time so the behaviour when
it wa sancho it wa sancha when it is governor it seora i
dont know if im right
seora teresa sai more than she is awar of said the page and now
give me someth to eat and let me go at onc for i mean to return
thi even
come and do penanc with me said the curat at thi for seora
teresa ha more will than mean to serv so worthi a guest
the page refus but had to consent at last for hi own sake and the
curat took him home with him veri gladli in order to have an
opportun of question him at leisur about don quixot and hi
do the bachelor offer to write the letter in repli for teresa
but she did not care to let him mix himself up in her affair for she
thought him somewhat given to joke and so she gave a cake and a
coupl of egg to a young acolyt who wa a penman and he wrote for
her two letter on for her husband and the other for the duchess
dictat out of her own head which ar not the worst insert in thi
great histori as will be seen farther on

dai came after the night of the governor round a night which the
headcarv pass without sleep so were hi thought of the face
and air and beauti of the disguis damsel while the majordomo spent
what wa left of it in write an account to hi lord and ladi of all
sancho said and did be as much amaz at hi sai as at hi
do for there wa a mixtur of shrewd and simplic in all hi
word and deed the seor governor got up and by doctor pedro recio
direct thei made him break hi fast on a littl conserv and four
sup of cold water which sancho would have readili exchang for a
piec of bread and a bunch of grape but see there wa no help for
it he submit with no littl sorrow of heart and discomfort of
stomach pedro recio have persuad him that light and delic diet
enliven the wit and that wa what wa most essenti for person
place in command and in respons situat where thei have to
emploi not onli the bodili power but those of the mind also
by mean of thi sophistri sancho wa made to endur hunger and hunger
so keen that in hi heart he curs the govern and even him who
had given it to him howev with hi hunger and hi conserv he
undertook to deliv judgment that dai and the first thing that came
befor him wa a question that wa submit to him by a stranger in
the presenc of the majordomo and the other attend and it wa in
these word seor a larg river separ two district of on and
the same lordshipwil your worship pleas to pai attent for the
case is an import and a rather knotti on well then on thi river
there wa a bridg and at on end of it a gallow and a sort of
tribun where four judg commonli sat to administ the law which
the lord of river bridg and the lordship had enact and which wa
to thi effect if anyon cross by thi bridg from on side to the
other he shall declar on oath where he is go to and with what
object and if he swear truli he shall be allow to pass but if
fals he shall be put to death for it by hang on the gallow
erect there without ani remiss though the law and it sever
penalti were known mani person cross but in their declar it
wa easi to see at onc thei were tell the truth and the judg let
them pass free it happen howev that on man when thei came to
take hi declar swore and said that by the oath he took he wa
go to die upon that gallow that stood there and noth els the
judg held a consult over the oath and thei said if we let
thi man pass free he ha sworn fals and by the law he ought to
die but if we hang him as he swore he wa go to die on that
gallow and therefor swore the truth by the same law he ought to go
free it is ask of your worship seor governor what ar the judg
to do with thi man for thei ar still in doubt and perplex and
have heard of your worship acut and exalt intellect thei have
sent me to entreat your worship on their behalf to give your opinion on
thi veri intric and puzzl case
to thi sancho made answer inde those gentlemen the judg that
send you to me might have spare themselv the troubl for i have
more of the obtus than the acut in me but repeat the case over
again so that i mai understand it and then perhap i mai be abl to
hit the point
the querist repeat again and again what he had said befor and then
sancho said it seem to me i can set the matter right in a moment
and in thi wai the man swear that he is go to die upon the
gallow but if he di upon it he ha sworn the truth and by the law
enact deserv to go free and pass over the bridg but if thei dont
hang him then he ha sworn fals and by the same law deserv to be
hang
it is as the seor governor sai said the messeng and as regard
a complet comprehens of the case there is noth left to desir
or hesit about
well then i sai said sancho that of thi man thei should let pass
the part that ha sworn truli and hang the part that ha li and in
thi wai the condit of the passag will be fulli compli with
but then seor governor repli the querist the man will have to
be divid into two part and if he is divid of cours he will die
and so none of the requir of the law will be carri out and it
is absolut necessari to compli with it
look here my good sir said sancho either im a numskul or els
there is the same reason for thi passeng dy as for hi live and
pass over the bridg for if the truth save him the falsehood
equal condemn him and that be the case it is my opinion you
should sai to the gentlemen who sent you to me that as the argument
for condemn him and for absolv him ar exactli balanc thei
should let him pass freeli as it is alwai more praiseworthi to do
good than to do evil thi i would give sign with my name if i knew
how to sign and what i have said in thi case is not out of my own
head but on of the mani precept my master don quixot gave me the
night befor i left to becom governor of thi island that came into
my mind and it wa thi that when there wa ani doubt about the
justic of a case i should lean to merci and it is god will that i
should recollect it now for it fit thi case as if it wa made for
it
that is true said the majordomo and i maintain that lycurgu
himself who gave law to the lacedemonian could not have pronounc
a better decis than the great panza ha given let the morn
audienc close with thi and i will see that the seor governor ha
dinner entir to hi like
that all i ask forfair plai said sancho give me my dinner and
then let it rain case and question on me and ill despatch them in a
twinkl
the majordomo kept hi word for he felt it against hi conscienc to
kill so wise a governor by hunger particularli as he intend to have
done with him that same night plai off the last joke he wa
commiss to practis upon him
it came to pass then that after he had dine that dai in opposit
to the rule and aphor of doctor tirteafuera as thei were take
awai the cloth there came a courier with a letter from don quixot for
the governor sancho order the secretari to read it to himself and
if there wa noth in it that demand secreci to read it aloud the
secretari did so and after he had skim the content he said it
mai well be read aloud for what seor don quixot write to your
worship deserv to be print or written in letter of gold and it is
as follow
don quixot of la mancha letter to sancho panza governor of the
island of barataria
when i wa expect to hear of thy stupid and blunder friend
sancho i have receiv intellig of thy displai of good sens for
which i give special thank to heaven that can rais the poor from the
dunghil and of fool to make wise men thei tell me thou dost govern
as if thou wert a man and art a man as if thou wert a beast so great
is the humil wherewith thou dost comport thyself but i would have
thee bear in mind sancho that veri often it is fit and necessari
for the author of offic to resist the humil of the heart for
the seemli arrai of on who is invest with grave duti should be
such as thei requir and not measur by what hi own humbl tast mai
lead him to prefer dress well a stick dress up doe not look like a
stick i do not sai thou shouldst wear trinket or fine raiment or
that be a judg thou shouldst dress like a soldier but that thou
shouldst arrai thyself in the apparel thy offic requir and that at
the same time it be neat and handsom to win the goodwil of the
peopl thou governest there ar two thing among other that thou
must do on is to be civil to all thi howev i told thee befor
and the other to take care that food be abund for there is noth
that vex the heart of the poor more than hunger and high price make
not mani proclam but those thou makest take care that thei be
good on and abov all that thei be observ and carri out for
proclam that ar not observ ar the same as if thei did not
exist nai thei encourag the idea that the princ who had the wisdom
and author to make them had not the power to enforc them and law
that threaten and ar not enforc come to be like the log the king of
the frog that frighten them at first but that in time thei
despis and mount upon be a father to virtu and a stepfath to
vice be not alwai strict nor yet alwai lenient but observ a mean
between these two extrem for in that is the aim of wisdom visit the
gaol the slaughterhous and the marketplac for the presenc of
the governor is of great import in such place it comfort the
prison who ar in hope of a speedi releas it is the bugbear of
the butcher who have then to give just weight and it is the terror of
the marketwomen for the same reason let it not be seen that thou art
even if perchanc thou art which i do not believ covet a
follow of women or a glutton for when the peopl and those that
have deal with thee becom awar of thy special weak thei will
bring their batteri to bear upon thee in that quarter till thei have
brought thee down to the depth of perdit consid and reconsid
con and con over again the advic and the instruct i gave thee
befor thy departur henc to thy govern and thou wilt see that in
them if thou dost follow them thou hast a help at hand that will
lighten for thee the troubl and difficulti that beset governor at
everi step write to thy lord and ladi and show thyself grate to
them for ingratitud is the daughter of pride and on of the greatest
sin we know of and he who is grate to those who have been good to
him show that he will be so to god also who ha bestow and still
bestow so mani bless upon him
my ladi the duchess sent off a messeng with thy suit and anoth
present to thy wife teresa panza we expect the answer everi
moment i have been a littl indispos through a certain
scratch i came in for not veri much to the benefit of my nose
but it wa noth for if there ar enchant who maltreat me
there ar also some who defend me let me know if the majordomo who
is with thee had ani share in the trifaldi perform as thou
didst suspect and keep me inform of everyth that happen
thee as the distanc is so short all the more as i am think of
give over veri shortli thi idl life i am now lead for i wa
not born for it a thing ha occur to me which i am inclin to
think will put me out of favour with the duke and duchess but
though i am sorri for it i do not care for after all i must obei
my call rather than their pleasur in accord with the
common sai amicu plato sed magi amica verita i quot
thi latin to thee becaus i conclud that sinc thou hast been a
governor thou wilt have learn it adieu god keep thee from be
an object of piti to anyon

be surpris if i have not until now sent you word of how i fare well
or ill in thi govern in which i am suffer more hunger than
when we two were wander through the wood and wast
my lord the duke wrote to me the other dai to warn me that certain
spi had got into thi island to kill me but up to the present i
have not found out ani except a certain doctor who receiv a
salari in thi town for kill all the governor that come here
he is call doctor pedro recio and is from tirteafuera so you

end the devil will carri me off
so far i have not handl ani due or taken ani bribe and i dont
know what to think of it for here thei tell me that the governor
that come to thi island befor enter it have plenti of monei
either given to them or lent to them by the peopl of the town and
that thi is the usual custom not onli here but with all who enter
upon govern
last night go the round i came upon a fair damsel in man
cloth and a brother of her dress as a woman my headcarv
ha fallen in love with the girl and ha in hi own mind chosen
her for a wife so he sai and i have chosen the youth for a
soninlaw todai we ar go to explain our intent to the

strive to show myself grate when the time come kiss her hand
for me and tell her i sai she ha not thrown it into a sack with a
hole in it as she will see in the end i should not like your

fall out with them it is plain it must do me harm and as you give
me advic to be grate it will not do for your worship not to be
so yourself to those who have shown you such kind and by whom

saragossa as the time of the festiv wa now draw near and he
hope to win there the suit of armour which is the prize at festiv
of the sort but on dai at tabl with the duke and duchess just as he
wa about to carri hi resolut into effect and ask for their
permiss lo and behold suddenli there came in through the door of
the great hall two women as thei afterward prove to be drape in
mourn from head to foot on of whom approach don quixot flung
herself at full length at hi feet press her lip to them and
utter moan so sad so deep and so dole that she put all who
heard and saw her into a state of perplex and though the duke and
duchess suppos it must be some joke their servant were plai off
upon don quixot still the earnest wai the woman sigh and moan and
wept puzzl them and made them feel uncertain until don quixot
touch with compass rais her up and made her unveil herself and
remov the mantl from her tear face she compli and disclos
what no on could have ever anticip for she disclos the
counten of doa rodriguez the duenna of the hous the other
femal in mourn be her daughter who had been made a fool of by
the rich farmer son all who knew her were fill with astonish
and the duke and duchess more than ani for though thei thought her a
simpleton and a weak creatur thei did not think her capabl of crazi
prank doa rodriguez at length turn to her master and mistress
said to them will your excel be pleas to permit me to speak
to thi gentleman for a moment for it is requisit i should do so in
order to get successfulli out of the busi in which the bold of
an evilmind clown ha involv me
the duke said that for hi part he gave her leav and that she might
speak with seor don quixot as much as she like
she then turn to don quixot and address herself to him said
some dai sinc valiant knight i gave you an account of the
injustic and treacheri of a wick farmer to my dearli belov
daughter the unhappi damsel here befor you and you promis me to
take her part and right the wrong that ha been done her but now it
ha come to my hear that you ar about to depart from thi castl in
quest of such fair adventur as god mai vouchsaf to you therefor
befor you take the road i would that you challeng thi froward
rustic and compel him to marri my daughter in fulfil of the
promis he gave her to becom her husband befor he seduc her for to
expect that my lord the duke will do me justic is to ask pear from
the elm tree for the reason i state privat to your worship and so
mai our lord grant you good health and forsak us not
to these word don quixot repli veri grave and solemnli worthi
duenna check your tear or rather dry them and spare your sigh for
i take it upon myself to obtain redress for your daughter for whom it
would have been better not to have been so readi to believ lover
promis which ar for the most part quickli made and veri slowli
perform and so with my lord the duke leav i will at onc go in
quest of thi inhuman youth and will find him out and challeng him
and slai him if so be he refus to keep hi promis word for the
chief object of my profess is to spare the humbl and chastis the
proud i mean to help the distress and destroi the oppressor
there is no necess said the duke for your worship to take the
troubl of seek out the rustic of whom thi worthi duenna complain
nor is there ani necess either for ask my leav to challeng
him for i admit him duli challeng and will take care that he is
inform of the challeng and accept it and come to answer it in
person to thi castl of mine where i shall afford to both a fair
field observ all the condit which ar usual and properli
observ in such trial and observ too justic to both side as
all princ who offer a free field to combat within the limit of
their lordship ar bound to do
then with that assur and your highnesss good leav said don
quixot i herebi for thi onc waiv my privileg of gentl blood
and come down and put myself on a level with the lowli birth of the
wrongdoer make myself equal with him and enabl him to enter into
combat with me and so i challeng and defi him though absent on the
plea of hi malfeas in break faith with thi poor damsel who
wa a maiden and now by hi misde is none and sai that he shall
fulfil the promis he gave her to becom her law husband or els
stake hi life upon the question
and then pluck off a glove he threw it down in the middl of the
hall and the duke pick it up sai as he had said befor that he
accept the challeng in the name of hi vassal and fix six dai
thenc as the time the courtyard of the castl as the place and for
arm the customari on of knight lanc and shield and full armour
with all the other accessori without trickeri guil or charm of
ani sort and examin and pass by the judg of the field but
first of all he said it is requisit that thi worthi duenna and
unworthi damsel should place their claim for justic in the hand of
don quixot for otherwis noth can be done nor can the said
challeng be brought to a law issu
i do so place it repli the duenna
and i too ad her daughter all in tear and cover with shame
and confus
thi declar have been made and the duke have settl in hi
own mind what he would do in the matter the ladi in black withdrew
and the duchess gave order that for the futur thei were not to be
treat as servant of her but as ladi adventur who came to her
hous to demand justic so thei gave them a room to themselv and
wait on them as thei would on stranger to the constern of the

fellow ill have time enough to tell thee then all that ha happen
me sinc i left our villag in obedi to hi majesti edict that
threaten such sever against the unfortun peopl of my nation
as thou hast heard
sancho compli and ricot have spoken to the other pilgrim thei
withdrew to the grove thei saw turn a consider distanc out of
the road thei threw down their stave took off their pilgrim cloak
and remain in their undercloth thei were all goodlook young
fellow except ricot who wa a man somewhat advanc in year thei
carri alforja all of them and all appar well fill at least
with thing provoc of thirst such as would summon it from two
leagu off thei stretch themselv on the ground and make a
tablecloth of the grass thei spread upon it bread salt knive
walnut scrap of chees and wellpick hambon which if thei were
past gnaw were not past suck thei also put down a black dainti
call thei sai caviar and made of the egg of fish a great
thirstwaken nor wa there ani lack of oliv dry it is true and
without ani season but for all that toothsom and pleasant but
what made the best show in the field of the banquet wa half a dozen
bota of wine for each of them produc hi own from hi alforja
even the good ricot who from a morisco had transform himself into a
german or dutchman took out hi which in size might have vi with
the five other thei then began to eat with veri great relish and veri
leisur make the most of each morselveri small on of
everythingthei took up on the point of the knife and then all at the
same moment rais their arm and bota aloft the mouth place in
their mouth and all ey fix on heaven just as if thei were take
aim at it and in thi attitud thei remain ever so long wag
their head from side to side as if in acknowledg of the pleasur
thei were enjoi while thei decant the bowel of the bottl into
their own stomach
sancho beheld all and noth gave him pain so far from that
act on the proverb he knew so well when thou art at rome do as
thou seest he ask ricot for hi bota and took aim like the rest of
them and with not less enjoy four time did the bota bear be
uplift but the fifth it wa all in vain for thei were drier and
more sapless than a rush by that time which made the jolliti that had
been kept up so far begin to flag
everi now and then someon of them would grasp sancho right hand in
hi own sai espaol y tudesqui tuto uno bon compao and sancho
would answer bon compao jur a di and then go off into a fit of
laughter that last an hour without a thought for the moment of
anyth that had befallen him in hi govern for care have veri
littl swai over us while we ar eat and drink at length the
wine have come to an end with them drowsi began to come over
them and thei drop asleep on their veri tabl and tablecloth
ricot and sancho alon remain awak for thei had eaten more and
drunk less and ricot draw sancho asid thei seat themselv at
the foot of a beech leav the pilgrim buri in sweet sleep and
without onc fall into hi own morisco tongu ricot spoke as
follow in pure castilian
thou knowest well neighbour and friend sancho panza how the
proclam or edict hi majesti command to be issu against those
of my nation fill us all with terror and dismai me at least it did
insomuch that i think befor the time grant us for quit spain wa
out the full forc of the penalti had alreadi fallen upon me and upon
my children i decid then and i think wise just like on who
know that at a certain date the hous he live in will be taken from
him and look out beforehand for anoth to chang into i decid i
sai to leav the town myself alon and without my famili and go to
seek out some place to remov them to comfort and not in the
hurri wai in which the other took their departur for i saw veri
plainli and so did all the older men among us that the proclam
were not mere threat as some said but posit enact which
would be enforc at the appoint time and what made me believ thi
wa what i knew of the base and extravag design which our peopl
harbour design of such a natur that i think it wa a divin
inspir that move hi majesti to carri out a resolut so
spirit not that we were all guilti for some there were true and
steadfast christian but thei were so few that thei could make no head
against those who were not and it wa not prudent to cherish a viper
in the bosom by have enemi in the hous in short it wa with just
caus that we were visit with the penalti of banish a mild and
lenient on in the ey of some but to us the most terribl that could
be inflict upon us wherev we ar we weep for spain for after all
we were born there and it is our natur fatherland nowher do we find
the recept our unhappi condit need and in barbari and all the
part of africa where we count upon be receiv succour and
welcom it is there thei insult and illtreat us most we knew not
our good fortun until we lost it and such is the long we almost
all of us have to return to spain that most of those who like myself
know the languag and there ar mani who do come back to it and leav
their wive and children forsaken yonder so great is their love for
it and now i know by experi the mean of the sai sweet is
the love of on countri
i left our villag as i said and went to franc but though thei
gave us a kind recept there i wa anxiou to see all i could i
cross into itali and reach germani and there it seem to me we
might live with more freedom as the inhabit do not pai ani
attent to trifl point everyon live as he like for in most
part thei enjoi liberti of conscienc i took a hous in a town near
augsburg and then join these pilgrim who ar in the habit of
come to spain in great number everi year to visit the shrine there
which thei look upon as their indi and a sure and certain sourc of
gain thei travel nearli all over it and there is no town out of which
thei do not go full up of meat and drink as the sai is and with a
real at least in monei and thei come off at the end of their travel
with more than a hundr crown save which chang into gold thei
smuggl out of the kingdom either in the hollow of their stave or in
the patch of their pilgrim cloak or by some devic of their own
and carri to their own countri in spite of the guard at the post and
pass where thei ar search now my purpos is sancho to carri
awai the treasur that i left buri which as it is outsid the town
i shall be abl to do without risk and to write or cross over from
valencia to my daughter and wife who i know ar at algier and find
some mean of bring them to some french port and thenc to germani
there to await what it mai be god will to do with us for after all
sancho i know well that ricota my daughter and francisca ricota my
wife ar cathol christian and though i am not so much so still i
am more of a christian than a moor and it is alwai my prayer to god
that he will open the ey of my understand and show me how i am to
serv him but what amaz me and i cannot understand is why my wife
and daughter should have gone to barbari rather than to franc where
thei could live as christian
to thi sancho repli rememb ricot that mai not have been open
to them for juan tiopieyo thy wife brother took them and be a
true moor he went where he could go most easili and anoth thing i
can tell thee it is my belief thou art go in vain to look for what
thou hast left buri for we heard thei took from thy brotherinlaw
and thy wife a great quantiti of pearl and monei in gold which thei
brought to be pass
that mai be said ricot but i know thei did not touch my hoard
for i did not tell them where it wa for fear of accid and so if
thou wilt come with me sancho and help me to take it awai and conceal
it i will give thee two hundr crown wherewith thou mayest reliev

there ar no island on the mainland
what no island said sancho i tell thee friend ricot i left it
thi morn and yesterdai i wa govern there as i pleas like a

danger offic a governor
and what hast thou gain by the govern ask ricot

govern unless it is a drove of cattl and that the rich that ar
to be got by these govern ar got at the cost of on rest and
sleep ay and even on food for in island the governor must eat
littl especi if thei have doctor to look after their health
i dont understand thee sancho said ricot but it seem to me all
nonsens thou art talk who would give thee island to govern is
there ani scarciti in the world of clever men than thou art for
governor hold thy peac sancho and come back to thy sens and
consid whether thou wilt come with me as i said to help me to take
awai treasur i left buri for inde it mai be call a treasur it
is so larg and i will give thee wherewith to keep thee as i told

and i have told thee alreadi ricot that i will not said sancho
let it content thee that by me thou shalt not be betrai and go thy
wai in god name and let me go mine for i know that wellgotten gain

our ladi hi mother and thi in such a touch wai that it made me
weep myself though im not much given to tear commonli and faith
mani a on would have like to hide her or go out and carri her off on
the road but the fear of go against the king command kept them
back the on who show himself most move wa don pedro gregorio the
rich young heir thou knowest of and thei sai he wa deep in love with
her and sinc she left he ha not been seen in our villag again and
we all suspect he ha gone after her to steal her awai but so far
noth ha been heard of it
i alwai had a suspicion that gentleman had a passion for my
daughter said ricot but as i felt sure of my ricota virtu it
gave me no uneasi to know that he love her for thou must have
heard it said sancho that the morisco women seldom or never engag in
amour with the old christian and my daughter who i fanci thought
more of be a christian than of lovemak would not troubl herself
about the attent of thi heir

in what he would have to do in the encount he expect to find
himself engag in the next dai as he wa put rocinant through
hi pace or press him to the charg he brought hi feet so close
to a pit that but for rein him in tightli it would have been
imposs for him to avoid fall into it he pull him up howev
without a fall and come a littl closer examin the hole without
dismount but as he wa look at it he heard loud cri proceed
from it and by listen attent wa abl to make out that he who
utter them wa sai ho abov there is there ani christian that

mind that sancho must be dead and that hi soul wa in torment down
there and carri awai by thi idea he exclaim i conjur thee by
everyth that as a cathol christian i can conjur thee by tell me

blind boi whom in our street thei commonli call love had no mind to
let slip the chanc of triumph over a lacquei heart and ad it
to the list of hi trophi and so steal gentli upon him unseen
he drove a dart two yard long into the poor lacquei left side and
pierc hi heart through and through which he wa abl to do quit at
hi eas for love is invis and come in and goe out as he like
without anyon call him to account for what he doe well then when
thei gave the signal for the onset our lacquei wa in an ecstasi
muse upon the beauti of her whom he had alreadi made mistress of hi
liberti and so he paid no attent to the sound of the trumpet
unlik don quixot who wa off the instant he heard it and at the

wa post and instead of do so call loudli to the marshal of the
field to whom when he came up to see what he want he said seor
is not thi battl to decid whether i marri or do not marri that

of the affair he knew not what to sai in repli don quixot pull up
in mid career when he saw that hi enemi wa not come on to the

mighti outcri exclaim thi is a trick thi is a trick thei have
put tosilo my lord the duke lacquei upon us in place of the real

when don quixot saw himself in open countri free and reliev from
the attent of altisidora he felt at hi eas and in fresh spirit
to take up the pursuit of chivalri onc more and turn to sancho he
said freedom sancho is on of the most preciou gift that heaven
ha bestow upon men no treasur that the earth hold buri or the
sea conceal can compar with it for freedom as for honour life mai
and should be ventur and on the other hand captiv is the
greatest evil that can fall to the lot of man i sai thi sancho
becaus thou hast seen the good cheer the abund we have enjoi in
thi castl we ar leav well then amid those dainti banquet and
snowcool beverag i felt as though i were undergo the strait of
hunger becaus i did not enjoi them with the same freedom as if thei
had been mine own for the sens of be under an oblig to return
benefit and favour receiv is a restraint that check the
independ of the spirit happi he to whom heaven ha given a piec
of bread for which he is not bound to give thank to ani but heaven
itself
for all your worship sai said sancho it is not becom that
there should be no thank on our part for two hundr gold crown that
the duke majordomo ha given me in a littl purs which i carri next
my heart like a warm plaster or comfort to meet ani chanc

now and then we mai light upon roadsid inn where theyll cudgel us
in convers of thi sort the knight and squir errant were pursu
their journei when after thei had gone a littl more than half a
leagu thei perceiv some dozen men dress like labour stretch
upon their cloak on the grass of a green meadow eat their dinner
thei had besid them what seem to be white sheet conceal some
object under them stand upright or ly flat and arrang at
interv don quixot approach the diner and salut them
courteous first he ask them what it wa those cloth cover
seor answer on of the parti under these cloth ar some imag
carv in relief intend for a retablo we ar put up in our
villag we carri them cover up that thei mai not be soil and on
our shoulder that thei mai not be broken
with your good leav said don quixot i should like to see them
for imag that ar carri so carefulli no doubt must be fine on
i should think thei were said the other let the monei thei cost
speak for that for as a matter of fact there is not on of them that
doe not stand us in more than fifti ducat and that your worship mai
judg wait a moment and you shall see with your own ey and
get up from hi dinner he went and uncov the first imag which
prove to be on of saint georg on horseback with a serpent writh
at hi feet and the lanc thrust down it throat with all that
fierc that is usual depict the whole group wa on blaze of
gold as the sai is on see it don quixot said that knight wa
on of the best knightserr the armi of heaven ever own he wa
call don saint georg and he wa moreov a defend of maiden let
us see thi next on
the man uncov it and it wa seen to be that of saint martin on hi
hors divid hi cloak with the beggar the instant don quixot saw
it he said thi knight too wa on of the christian adventur but
i believ he wa gener rather than valiant as thou mayest perceiv
sancho by hi divid hi cloak with the beggar and give him half
of it no doubt it wa winter at the time for otherwis he would have
given him the whole of it so charit wa he
it wa not that most like said sancho but that he held with the
proverb that sai for give and keep there need of brain
don quixot laugh and ask them to take off the next cloth
underneath which wa seen the imag of the patron saint of the spain
seat on horseback hi sword stain with blood trampl on moor
and tread head underfoot and on see it don quixot exclaim
ay thi is a knight and of the squadron of christ thi on is
call don saint jame the moorslay on of the bravest saint and
knight the world ever had or heaven ha now
thei then rais anoth cloth which it appear cover saint paul
fall from hi hors with all the detail that ar usual given in
represent of hi convers when don quixot saw it render in
such lifelik style that on would have said christ wa speak and
paul answer thi he said wa in hi time the greatest enemi
that the church of god our lord had and the greatest champion it will
ever have a knighterr in life a steadfast saint in death an
untir labour in the lord vineyard a teacher of the gentil
whose school wa heaven and whose instructor and master wa jesu
christ himself
there were no more imag so don quixot bade them cover them up
again and said to those who had brought them i take it as a happi
omen brother to have seen what i have for these saint and knight
were of the same profess as myself which is the call of arm
onli there is thi differ between them and me that thei were
saint and fought with divin weapon and i am a sinner and fight
with human on thei won heaven by forc of arm for heaven suffereth
violenc and i so far know not what i have won by dint of my
suffer but if my dulcinea del toboso were to be releas from
her perhap with mend fortun and a mind restor to itself i
might direct my step in a better path than i am follow at present
mai god hear and sin be deaf said sancho to thi
the men were fill with wonder as well at the figur as at the word
of don quixot though thei did not understand on half of what he
meant by them thei finish their dinner took their imag on their
back and bid farewel to don quixot resum their journei
sancho wa amaz afresh at the extent of hi master knowledg as
much as if he had never known him for it seem to him that there wa
no stori or event in the world that he had not at hi finger end and
fix in hi memori and he said to him in truth master mine if
thi that ha happen to us todai is to be call an adventur it
ha been on of the sweetest and pleasantest that have befallen us in
the whole cours of our travel we have come out of it unbelabour
and undismai neither have we drawn sword nor have we smitten the
earth with our bodi nor have we been left famish bless be god
that he ha let me see such a thing with my own ey
thou sayest well sancho said don quixot but rememb all time
ar not alik nor do thei alwai run the same wai and these thing the
vulgar commonli call omen which ar not base upon ani natur
reason will by him who is wise be esteem and reckon happi
accid mere on of these believ in omen will get up of a
morn leav hi hous and meet a friar of the order of the bless
saint franci and as if he had met a griffin he will turn about and
go home with anoth mendoza the salt is spilt on hi tabl and gloom
is spilt over hi heart as if natur wa oblig to give warn of
come misfortun by mean of such trivial thing as these the wise
man and the christian should not trifl with what it mai pleas heaven
to do scipio on come to africa stumbl as he leap on shore hi
soldier took it as a bad omen but he clasp the soil with hi
arm exclaim thou canst not escap me africa for i hold thee
tight between my arm thu sancho meet those imag ha been to
me a most happi occurr
i can well believ it said sancho but i wish your worship would
tell me what is the reason that the spaniard when thei ar about to
give battl in call on that saint jame the moorslay sai
santiago and close spain is spain then open so that it is need
to close it or what is the mean of thi form
thou art veri simpl sancho said don quixot god look you gave
that great knight of the red cross to spain as her patron saint and
protector especi in those hard struggl the spaniard had with
the moor and therefor thei invok and call upon him as their
defend in all their battl and in these he ha been mani a time
seen beat down trampl under foot destroi and slaughter
the hagaren squadron in the sight of all of which fact i could give
thee mani exampl record in truth spanish histori
sancho chang the subject and said to hi master i marvel seor
at the bold of altisidora the duchesss handmaid he whom thei
call love must have cruelli pierc and wound her thei sai he is a
littl blind urchin who though blearei or more properli speak
sightless if he aim at a heart be it ever so small hit it and
pierc it through and through with hi arrow i have heard it said
too that the arrow of love ar blunt and rob of their point by
maidenli modesti and reserv but with thi altisidora it seem thei
ar sharpen rather than blunt
bear in mind sancho said don quixot that love is influenc by
no consider recognis no restraint of reason and is of the
same natur as death that assail alik the lofti palac of king and
the humbl cabin of shepherd and when it take entir possess of
a heart the first thing it doe is to banish fear and shame from it
and so without shame altisidora declar her passion which excit in
my mind embarrass rather than commiser
notabl cruelti exclaim sancho unheardof ingratitud i can
onli sai for myself that the veri smallest love word of her would
have subdu me and made a slave of me the devil what a heart of
marbl what bowel of brass what a soul of mortar but i cant
imagin what it is that thi damsel saw in your worship that could have
conquer and captiv her so what gallant figur wa it what bold
bear what sprightli grace what comeli of featur which of
these thing by itself or what all togeth could have made her fall
in love with you for inde and in truth mani a time i stop to look at
your worship from the sole of your foot to the topmost hair of your
head and i see more to frighten on than to make on fall in love
moreov i have heard sai that beauti is the first and main thing that
excit love and as your worship ha none at all i dont know what
the poor creatur fell in love with
recollect sancho repli don quixot there ar two sort of
beauti on of the mind the other of the bodi that of the mind
displai and exhibit itself in intellig in modesti in honour
conduct in generos in good breed and all these qualiti ar
possibl and mai exist in an ugli man and when it is thi sort of
beauti and not that of the bodi that is the attract love is apt to
spring up suddenli and violent i sancho perceiv clearli enough
that i am not beauti but at the same time i know i am not hideou
and it is enough for an honest man not to be a monster to be an object
of love if onli he possess the endow of mind i have mention
while engag in thi discours thei were make their wai through a
wood that lai beyond the road when suddenli without expect
anyth of the kind don quixot found himself caught in some net of
green cord stretch from on tree to anoth and unabl to conceiv
what it could be he said to sancho sancho it strike me thi affair
of these net will prove on of the strangest adventur imagin
mai i die if the enchant that persecut me ar not try to
entangl me in them and delai my journei by wai of reveng for my
obduraci toward altisidora well then let me tell them that if these
net instead of be green cord were made of the hardest diamond
or stronger than that wherewith the jealou god of blacksmith enmesh
venu and mar i would break them as easili as if thei were made of
rush or cotton thread but just as he wa about to press forward
and break through all suddenli from among some tree two shepherdess
of surpass beauti present themselv to hi sightor at least
damsel dress like shepherdess save that their jerkin and saya
were of fine brocad that is to sai the saya were rich farthingal

exagger languag of mine know that it is no less than don quixot
of la mancha that make thi declar to you if inde it be that
such a name ha reach your ear
ah friend of my soul instantli exclaim the other shepherdess
what great good fortun ha befallen us seest thou thi gentleman we
have befor us well then let me tell thee he is the most valiant and
the most devot and the most courteou gentleman in all the world
unless a histori of hi achiev that ha been print and i have

good fellow who is with him is on sancho panza hi squir whose
drolleri none can equal

of and thi gentleman is my master don quixot of la mancha the same
that in the histori and that thei talk about

constant and loyal lover that wa ever heard of and that hi ladi is

and justli award said don quixot unless inde your
unequal beauti make it a matter of doubt but spare yourselv the
troubl ladi of press me to stai for the urgent call of my

on of the greatest sin that men ar guilti of issom will sai
pridebut i sai ingratitud go by the common sai that hell is
full of ingrat thi sin so far as it ha lain in my power i have
endeavour to avoid ever sinc i have enjoi the faculti of reason
and if i am unabl to requit good deed that have been done me by
other deed i substitut the desir to do so and if that be not
enough i make them known publicli for he who declar and make known
the good deed done to him would repai them by other if it were in hi
power and for the most part those who receiv ar the inferior of
those who give thu god is superior to all becaus he is the suprem
giver and the offer of man fall short by an infinit distanc of
be a full return for the gift of god but gratitud in some degre
make up for thi defici and shortcom i therefor grate for
the favour that ha been extend to me here and unabl to make a
return in the same measur restrict as i am by the narrow limit of
my power offer what i can and what i have to offer in my own wai and
so i declar that for two full dai i will maintain in the middl of

shepherdess who ar here present ar the fairest and most courteou
maiden in the world except onli the peerless dulcinea del toboso
sole mistress of my thought be it said without offenc to those who

or learn who could sai what my master ha said or is there
knighterr whatev renown he mai have as a man of valour that
could offer what my master ha offer now
don quixot turn upon sancho and with a counten glow with
anger said to him is it possibl sancho there is anyon in the
whole world who will sai thou art not a fool with a line to match
and i know not what trim of impertin and rogueri who ask
thee to meddl in my affair or to inquir whether i am a wise man or
a blockhead hold thy peac answer me not a word saddl rocinant if
he be unsaddl and let us go to put my offer into execut for with
the right that i have on my side thou mayest reckon as vanquish all
who shall ventur to question it and in a great rage and show hi
anger plainli he rose from hi seat leav the compani lost in
wonder and make them feel doubt whether thei ought to regard him
as a madman or a ration be in the end though thei sought to
dissuad him from involv himself in such a challeng assur him
thei admit hi gratitud as fulli establish and need no fresh
proof to be convinc of hi valiant spirit as those relat in the
histori of hi exploit were suffici still don quixot persist in
hi resolv and mount on rocinant brace hi buckler on hi arm

him who is of the opposit opinion come on for here i await him
twice he repeat the same word and twice thei fell unheard by ani
adventur but fate that wa guid affair for him from better to
better so order it that shortli afterward there appear on the
road a crowd of men on horseback mani of them with lanc in their
hand all ride in a compact bodi and in great hast no sooner had
those who were with don quixot seen them than thei turn about and
withdrew to some distanc from the road for thei knew that if thei

heart stood hi ground and sancho panza shield himself with

crush by the feet of unclean and filthi anim thi thought blunt
my teeth paralys my jaw cramp my hand and rob me of all
appetit for food so much so that i have a mind to let myself die of
hunger the cruelest death of all death
so then said sancho munch hard all the time your worship doe
not agre with the proverb that sai let martha die but let her die
with a full belli i at ani rate have no mind to kill myself so far
from that i mean to do as the cobbler doe who stretch the leather
with hi teeth until he make it reach as far as he want ill stretch
out my life by eat until it reach the end heaven ha fix for it
and let me tell you seor there no greater folli than to think of
dy of despair as your worship doe take my advic and after eat
lie down and sleep a bit on thi green grassmattress and you will see
that when you awak youll feel someth better
don quixot did as he recommend for it struck him that sancho
reason wa more like a philosoph than a blockhead and said
he sancho if thou wilt do for me what i am go to tell thee my
eas of mind would be more assur and my heavi of heart not so
great and it is thi to go asid a littl while i am sleep in
accord with thy advic and make bare thy carcas to the air to
give thyself three or four hundr lash with rocinant rein on
account of the three thousand and odd thou art to give thyself for the
disenchant of dulcinea for it is a great piti that the poor ladi
should be left enchant through thy careless and neglig
there is a good deal to be said on that point said sancho let us
both go to sleep now and after that god ha decre what will happen
let me tell your worship that for a man to whip himself in cold blood

what call or what profess it wa hi master wa of
suppertim have come then don quixot betook himself to hi room
the landlord brought in the stewpan just as it wa and he sat himself
down to sup veri resolut it seem that in anoth room which wa
next to don quixot with noth but a thin partit to separ
it he overheard these word as you live seor don jeronimo while
thei ar bring supper let us read anoth chapter of the second
part of don quixot of la mancha
the instant don quixot heard hi own name he start to hi feet and
listen with open ear to catch what thei said about him and heard
the don jeronimo who had been address sai in repli why would you
have us read that absurd stuff don juan when it is imposs for
anyon who ha read the first part of the histori of don quixot of la
mancha to take ani pleasur in read thi second part
for all that said he who wa address as don juan we shall do
well to read it for there is no book so bad but it ha someth good
in it what displeas me most in it is that it repres don quixot
as now cure of hi love for dulcinea del toboso
on hear thi don quixot full of wrath and indign lift up
hi voic and said whoever he mai be who sai that don quixot of la
mancha ha forgotten or can forget dulcinea del toboso i will teach
him with equal arm that what he sai is veri far from the truth for
neither can the peerless dulcinea del toboso be forgotten nor can
forget have a place in don quixot hi motto is constanc and
hi profess to maintain the same with hi life and never wrong it
who is thi that answer us said thei in the next room
who should it be said sancho but don quixot of la mancha himself
who will make good all he ha said and all he will sai for pledg
dont troubl a good payer
sancho had hardli utter these word when two gentlemen for such thei
seem to be enter the room and on of them throw hi arm
round don quixot neck said to him your appear cannot leav
ani question as to your name nor can your name fail to identifi your

mancha cynosur and morn star of knighterrantri despit and in
defianc of him who ha sought to usurp your name and bring to naught
your achiev as the author of thi book which i here present to
you ha done and with thi he put a book which hi companion carri
into the hand of don quixot who took it and without repli began
to run hi ey over it but he present return it sai in the
littl i have seen i have discov three thing in thi author that
deserv to be censur the first is some word that i have read in the
prefac the next that the languag is aragones for sometim he
write without articl and the third which abov all stamp him as
ignor is that he goe wrong and depart from the truth in the most
import part of the histori for here he sai that my squir sancho
panza wife is call mari gutierrez when she is call noth of
the sort but teresa panza and when a man err on such an import
point as thi there is good reason to fear that he is in error on everi
other point in the histori
a nice sort of historian inde exclaim sancho at thi he must
know a deal about our affair when he call my wife teresa panza mari
gutierrez take the book again seor and see if i am in it and if he
ha chang my name
from your talk friend said don jeronimo no doubt you ar sancho
panza seor don quixot squir
ye i am said sancho and im proud of it
faith then said the gentleman thi new author doe not handl you
with the decenc that displai itself in your person he make you out
a heavi feeder and a fool and not in the least droll and a veri
differ be from the sancho describ in the first part of your
master histori
god forgiv him said sancho he might have left me in my corner
without troubl hi head about me let him who know how ring the
bell saint peter is veri well in rome
the two gentlemen press don quixot to come into their room and have
supper with them as thei knew veri well there wa noth in that inn
fit for on of hi sort don quixot who wa alwai polit yield to
their request and sup with them sancho stai behind with the stew
and invest with plenari deleg author seat himself at the
head of the tabl and the landlord sat down with him for he wa no
less fond of cowheel and calv feet than sancho wa
while at supper don juan ask don quixot what new he had of the ladi
dulcinea del toboso wa she marri had she been brought to bed or
wa she with child or did she in maidenhood still preserv her
modesti and delicaci cherish the remembr of the tender passion of
seor don quixot
to thi he repli dulcinea is a maiden still and my passion more
firmli root than ever our intercours unsatisfactori as befor and
her beauti transform into that of a foul countri wench and then he
proceed to give them a full and particular account of the enchant
of dulcinea and of what had happen him in the cave of montesino
togeth with what the sage merlin had prescrib for her
disenchant name the scourg of sancho
exceedingli great wa the amus the two gentlemen deriv from
hear don quixot recount the strang incid of hi histori and
if thei were amaz by hi absurd thei were equal amaz by the
eleg style in which he deliv them on the on hand thei regard
him as a man of wit and sens and on the other he seem to them a
maunder blockhead and thei could not make up their mind
whereabout between wisdom and folli thei ought to place him
sancho have finish hi supper and left the landlord in the x
condit repair to the room where hi master wa and as he came in
said mai i die sir if the author of thi book your worship have
got ha ani mind that we should agre as he call me glutton
accord to what your worship sai i wish he mai not call me
drunkard too
but he doe said don jeronimo i cannot rememb howev in what
wai though i know hi word ar offens and what is more ly as
i can see plainli by the physiognomi of the worthi sancho befor me
believ me said sancho the sancho and the don quixot of thi
histori must be differ person from those that appear in the on
cide hamet beneng wrote who ar ourselv my master valiant
wise and true in love and i simpl droll and neither glutton nor

let him who will paint me said don quixot but let him not abus
me for patienc will often break down when thei heap insult upon it
none can be offer to seor don quixot said don juan that he
himself will not be abl to aveng if he doe not ward it off with the
shield of hi patienc which i take it is great and strong
a consider portion of the night pass in convers of thi
sort and though don juan wish don quixot to read more of the book
to see what it wa all about he wa not to be prevail upon sai
that he treat it as read and pronounc it utterli silli and if by
ani chanc it should come to it author ear that he had it in hi
hand he did not want him to flatter himself with the idea that he had
read it for our thought and still more our ey should keep
themselv aloof from what is obscen and filthi
thei ask him whither he meant to direct hi step he repli to
saragossa to take part in the har joust which were held in that
citi everi year don juan told him that the new histori describ how
don quixot let him be who he might took part there in a tilt at
the ring utterli devoid of invent poor in motto veri poor in
costum though rich in silli
for that veri reason said don quixot i will not set foot in
saragossa and by that mean i shall expos to the world the lie of
thi new histori writer and peopl will see that i am not the don
quixot he speak of
you will do quit right said don jeronimo and there ar other
joust at barcelona in which seor don quixot mai displai hi
prowess
that is what i mean to do said don quixot and as it is now time
i prai your worship to give me leav to retir to bed and to place
and retain me among the number of your greatest friend and servant
and me too said sancho mayb ill be good for someth
with thi thei exchang farewel and don quixot and sancho retir
to their room leav don juan and don jeronimo amaz to see the
medlei he made of hi good sens and hi crazi and thei felt
thoroughli convinc that these and not those their aragones author
describ were the genuin don quixot and sancho don quixot rose

it wa a fresh morn give promis of a cool dai as don quixot
quit the inn first of all take care to ascertain the most direct
road to barcelona without touch upon saragossa so anxiou wa he to
make out thi new historian who thei said abus him so to be a liar
well as it fell out noth worthi of be record happen him for
six dai at the end of which have turn asid out of the road he
wa overtaken by night in a thicket of oak or cork tree for on thi
point cide hamet is not as precis as he usual is on other matter
master and man dismount from their beast and as soon as thei had
settl themselv at the foot of the tree sancho who had had a good
noontid meal that dai let himself without more ado pass the gate
of sleep but don quixot whom hi thought far more than hunger
kept awak could not close an ey and roam in fanci to and fro
through all sort of place at on moment it seem to him that he wa
in the cave of montesino and saw dulcinea transform into a countri
wench skip and mount upon her sheass again that the word of
the sage merlin were sound in hi ear set forth the condit
to be observ and the exert to be made for the disenchant of
dulcinea he lost all patienc when he consid the lazi and want
of chariti of hi squir sancho for to the best of hi belief he had
onli given himself five lash a number paltri and disproport to
the vast number requir at thi thought he felt such vexat and
anger that he reason the matter thu if alexand the great cut the
gordian knot sai to cut come to the same thing as to unti and
yet did not fail to becom lord paramount of all asia neither more nor
less could happen now in dulcinea disenchant if i scourg sancho
against hi will for if it is the condit of the remedi that sancho
shall receiv three thousand and odd lash what doe it matter to me
whether he inflict them himself or someon els inflict them when
the essenti point is that he receiv them let them come from
whatev quarter thei mai
with thi idea he went over to sancho have first taken rocinant
rein and arrang them so as to be abl to flog him with them and
began to unti the point the common belief is he had but on in
front by which hi breech were held up but the instant he
approach him sancho woke up in hi full sens and cri out what
is thi who is touch me and untruss me
it is i said don quixot and i come to make good thy shortcom
and reliev my own distress i come to whip thee sancho and wipe
off some portion of the debt thou hast undertaken dulcinea is
perish thou art live on regardless i am dy of hope defer
therefor untruss thyself with a good will for mine it is here in
thi retir spot to give thee at least two thousand lash
not a bit of it said sancho let your worship keep quiet or els
by the live god the deaf shall hear us the lash i pledg myself
to must be voluntari and not forc upon me and just now i have no
fanci to whip myself it is enough if i give you my word to flog and
flap myself when i have a mind
it will not do to leav it to thy courtesi sancho said don quixot
for thou art hard of heart and though a clown tender of flesh and
at the same time he strove and struggl to unti him
see thi sancho got up and grappl with hi master he grip him
with all hi might in hi arm give him a trip with the heel
stretch him on the ground on hi back and press hi right knee on
hi chest held hi hand in hi own so that he could neither move nor
breath
how now traitor exclaim don quixot dost thou revolt against
thy master and natur lord dost thou rise against him who give thee
hi bread
i neither put down king nor set up king said sancho i onli stand
up for myself who am my own lord if your worship promis me to be
quiet and not to offer to whip me now ill let you go free and
unhind if not

sancho rose and remov some distanc from the spot but as he wa
about to place himself lean against anoth tree he felt someth
touch hi head and put up hi hand encount somebodi two
feet with shoe and stock on them he trembl with fear and made
for anoth tree where the veri same thing happen to him and he
fell ashout call upon don quixot to come and protect him don
quixot did so and ask him what had happen to him and what he wa
afraid of sancho repli that all the tree were full of men feet
and leg don quixot felt them and guess at onc what it wa and
said to sancho thou hast noth to be afraid of for these feet and
leg that thou feelest but canst not see belong no doubt to some
outlaw and freeboot that have been hang on these tree for the
author in these part ar wont to hang them up by twenti and
thirti when thei catch them wherebi i conjectur that i must be near
barcelona and it wa in fact as he suppos with the first light
thei look up and saw that the fruit hang on those tree were
freeboot bodi
and now dai dawn and if the dead freeboot had scare them their
heart were no less troubl by upward of forti live on who all
of a sudden surround them and in the catalan tongu bade them stand
and wait until their captain came up don quixot wa on foot with hi
hors unbridl and hi lanc lean against a tree and in short
complet defenceless he thought it best therefor to fold hi arm
and bow hi head and reserv himself for a more favour occas and
opportun the robber made hast to search dappl and did not leav
him a singl thing of all he carri in the alforja and in the valis
and lucki it wa for sancho that the duke crown and those he brought
from home were in a girdl that he wore round him but for all that
these good folk would have strip him and even look to see what he
had hidden between the skin and flesh but for the arriv at that
moment of their captain who wa about thirtyfour year of ag
appar strongli built abov the middl height of stern aspect
and swarthi complexion he wa mount upon a power hors and had
on a coat of mail with four of the pistol thei call petronel in that
countri at hi waist he saw that hi squir for so thei call those
who follow that trade were about to rifl sancho panza but he order
them to desist and wa at onc obei so the girdl escap he
wonder to see the lanc lean against the tree the shield on the
ground and don quixot in armour and deject with the saddest and
most melancholi face that sad itself could produc and go up to
him he said be not so cast down good man for you have not fallen
into the hand of ani inhuman busiri but into roqu guinart which
ar more merci than cruel
the caus of my deject return don quixot is not that i have
fallen into thy hand o valiant roqu whose fame is bound by no
limit on earth but that my careless should have been so great
that thy soldier should have caught me unbridl when it is my duti
accord to the rule of knighterrantri which i profess to be alwai
on the alert and at all time my own sentinel for let me tell thee
great roqu had thei found me on my hors with my lanc and shield
it would not have been veri easi for them to reduc me to submiss
for i am don quixot of la mancha he who hath fill the whole world
with hi achiev
roqu guinart at onc perceiv that don quixot weak wa more
akin to mad than to swagger and though he had sometim heard him
spoken of he never regard the thing attribut to him as true nor
could he persuad himself that such a humour could becom domin in
the heart of man he wa extrem glad therefor to meet him and
test at close quarter what he had heard of him at a distanc so he
said to him despair not valiant knight nor regard as an untoward
fate the posit in which thou findest thyself it mai be that by
these slip thy crook fortun will make itself straight for heaven
by strang circuit wai mysteri and incomprehens to man
rais up the fallen and make rich the poor
don quixot wa about to thank him when thei heard behind them a nois
as of a troop of hors there wa howev but on ride on which
at a furiou pace came a youth appar about twenti year of ag
clad in green damask edg with gold and breech and a loos frock
with a hat loop up in the walloon fashion tightfit polish

claudia wrung hi hand and her own heart wa so wrung that she lai

then he had never seen a print offic and he wa curiou to know
what it wa like he enter with all hi follow and saw them
draw sheet in on place correct in anoth set up type
here revis there in short all the work that is to be seen in great
print offic he went up to on case and ask what thei were about
there the workmen told him he watch them with wonder and pass
on he approach on man among other and ask him what he wa

man of prepossess appear and a certain graviti of look ha
translat an italian book into our spanish tongu and i am set it
up in type for the press
what is the titl of the book ask don quixot to which the author
repli seor in italian the book is call le bagatel
and what doe le bagatel import in our spanish ask don
quixot
le bagatel said the author is as though we should sai in
spanish lo juguet but though the book is humbl in name it ha
good solid matter in it
i said don quixot have some littl smatter of italian and i
plume myself on sing some of ariosto stanza but tell me seori
do not sai thi to test your abil but mere out of curiosityhav
you ever met with the word pignatta in your book
ye often said the author
and how do you render that in spanish
how should i render it return the author but by olla
bodi o me exclaim don quixot what a profici you ar in the
italian languag i would lai a good wager that where thei sai in
italian piac you sai in spanish place and where thei sai piu
you sai ma and you translat s by arriba and gi by
abajo
i translat them so of cours said the author for those ar their
proper equival
i would ventur to swear said don quixot that your worship is not
known in the world which alwai begrudg their reward to rare wit
and praiseworthi labour what talent lie wast there what geniu
thrust awai into corner what worth left neglect still it seem to
me that translat from on languag into anoth if it be not from
the queen of languag the greek and the latin is like look at
flemish tapestri on the wrong side for though the figur ar
visibl thei ar full of thread that make them indistinct and thei
do not show with the smooth and bright of the right side and
translat from easi languag argu neither ingenu nor command of
word ani more than transcrib or copi out on document from
anoth but i do not mean by thi to draw the infer that no credit
is to be allow for the work of translat for a man mai emploi
himself in wai wors and less profit to himself thi estim
doe not includ two famou translat doctor cristbal de figueroa
in hi pastor fido and don juan de juregui in hi aminta
wherein by their felic thei leav it in doubt which is the
translat and which the origin but tell me ar you print thi
book at your own risk or have you sold the copyright to some
booksel
i print at my own risk said the author and i expect to make a
thousand ducat at least by thi first edit which is to be of two
thousand copi that will go off in a twinkl at six real apiec
a fine calcul you ar make said don quixot it is plain you
dont know the in and out of the printer and how thei plai into on
anoth hand i promis you when you find yourself saddl with two
thousand copi you will feel so sore that it will astonish you
particularli if the book is a littl out of the common and not in ani
wai highli spice
what said the author would your worship then have me give it to
a booksel who will give three maravedi for the copyright and think
he is do me a favour i do not print my book to win fame in the
world for i am known in it alreadi by my work i want to make monei
without which reput is not worth a rap
god send your worship good luck said don quixot and he move on to
anoth case where he saw them correct a sheet of a book with the
titl of light of the soul notic it he observ book like
thi though there ar mani of the kind ar the on that deserv to
be print for mani ar the sinner in these dai and light
unnumb ar need for all that ar in dark
he pass on and saw thei were also correct anoth book and when
he ask it titl thei told him it wa call the second part of the
ingeni gentleman don quixot of la mancha by on of tordesilla
i have heard of thi book alreadi said don quixot and verili and
on my conscienc i thought it had been by thi time burn to ash as
a meddlesom intrud but it martinma will come to it as it doe to
everi pig for fiction have the more merit and charm about them the
more nearli thei approach the truth or what look like it and true
stori the truer thei ar the better thei ar and so sai he
walk out of the print offic with a certain amount of displeasur

all concentr on the promis which he regard as a certainti of
dulcinea disenchant thi he turn over in hi mind again and
again with great satisfact fulli persuad that he would shortli
see it fulfil and as for sancho though as ha been said he
hate be a governor still he had a long to be give order and
find himself obei onc more thi is the misfortun that be in
author even in jest bring with it
to resum that afternoon their host don antonio moreno and hi two
friend with don quixot and sancho went to the gallei the
command had been alreadi made awar of hi good fortun in see
two such famou person as don quixot and sancho and the instant thei
came to the shore all the gallei struck their awn and the clarion
rang out a skiff cover with rich carpet and cushion of crimson
velvet wa immedi lower into the water and as don quixot
step on board of it the lead gallei fire her gangwai gun and
the other gallei did the same and as he mount the starboard ladder
the whole crew salut him as is the custom when a personag of
distinct come on board a gallei by exclaim hu hu hu three
time the gener for so we shall call him a valencian gentleman of
rank gave him hi hand and embrac him sai i shall mark thi
dai with a white stone as on of the happiest i can expect to enjoi in
my lifetim sinc i have seen seor don quixot of la mancha pattern
and imag wherein we see contain and condens all that is worthi in
knighterrantri
don quixot delight beyond measur with such a lordli recept
repli to him in word no less courteou all then proceed to the
poop which wa veri handsom decor and seat themselv on the
bulwark bench the boatswain pass along the gangwai and pipe all
hand to strip which thei did in an instant sancho see such a
number of men strip to the skin wa taken aback and still more
when he saw them spread the awn so briskli that it seem to him as
if all the devil were at work at it but all thi wa cake and fanci
bread to what i am go to tell now sancho wa seat on the
captain stage close to the aftermost rower on the righthand side
he previous instruct in what he wa to do laid hold of sancho
hoist him up in hi arm and the whole crew who were stand
readi begin on the right proceed to pass him on whirl him
along from hand to hand and from bench to bench with such rapid that
it took the sight out of poor sancho ey and he made quit sure
that the devil themselv were fly awai with him nor did thei
leav off with him until thei had sent him back along the left side and
deposit him on the poop and the poor fellow wa left bruis and
breathless and all in a sweat and unabl to comprehend what it wa
that had happen to him
don quixot when he saw sancho flight without wing ask the gener
if thi wa a usual ceremoni with those who came on board the gallei
for the first time for if so as he had no intent of adopt them
as a profess he had no mind to perform such feat of agil and
if anyon offer to lai hold of him to whirl him about he vow to
god he would kick hi soul out and as he said thi he stood up and
clap hi hand upon hi sword at thi instant thei struck the awn
and lower the yard with a prodigi rattl sancho thought heaven
wa come off it hing and go to fall on hi head and full of
terror he duck it and buri it between hi knee nor were don
quixot knee altogeth under control for he too shook a littl
squeez hi shoulder togeth and lost colour the crew then hoist
the yard with the same rapid and clatter as when thei lower it
all the while keep silenc as though thei had neither voic nor
breath the boatswain gave the signal to weigh anchor and leap upon
the middl of the gangwai began to lai on to the shoulder of the crew
with hi courbash or whip and to haul out gradual to sea
when sancho saw so mani red feet for such he took the oar to be
move all togeth he said to himself it these that ar the real
chant thing and not the on my master talk of what can those
wretch have done to be so whip and how doe that on man who goe
along there whistl dare to whip so mani i declar thi is hell or
at least purgatori
don quixot observ how attent sancho regard what wa go
on said to him ah sancho my friend how quickli and cheapli might
you finish off the disenchant of dulcinea if you would strip to
the waist and take your place among those gentlemen amid the pain and
suffer of so mani you would not feel your own much and moreov
perhap the sage merlin would allow each of these lash be laid on
with a good hand to count for ten of those which you must give
yourself at last
the gener wa about to ask what these lash were and what wa
dulcinea disenchant when a sailor exclaim monjui signal
that there is an oar vessel off the coast to the west
on hear thi the gener sprang upon the gangwai cry now then
my son dont let her give us the slip it must be some algerin
corsair brigantin that the watchtow signal to us the three other
immedi came alongsid the chief gallei to receiv their order
the gener order two to put out to sea while he with the other kept
in shore so that in thi wai the vessel could not escap them the
crew pli the oar drive the gallei so furious that thei seem
to fly the two that had put out to sea after a coupl of mile
sight a vessel which so far as thei could make out thei judg to
be on of fourteen or fifteen bank and so she prove as soon as the
vessel discov the gallei she went about with the object and in the
hope of make her escap by her speed but the attempt fail for the
chief gallei wa on of the fastest vessel afloat and overhaul her
so rapidli that thei on board the brigantin saw clearli there wa no
possibl of escap and the rai therefor would have had them
drop their oar and give themselv up so as not to provok the captain
in command of our gallei to anger but chanc direct thing
otherwis so order it that just as the chief gallei came close
enough for those on board the vessel to hear the shout from her
call on them to surrend two toraqui that is to sai two turk
both drunken that with a dozen more were on board the brigantin
discharg their musket kill two of the soldier that line the
side of our vessel see thi the gener swore he would not leav
on of those he found on board the vessel aliv but as he bore down
furious upon her she slip awai from him underneath the oar the
gallei shot a good wai ahead those on board the vessel saw their case
wa desper and while the gallei wa come about thei made sail
and by sail and row onc more tri to sheer off but their
activ did not do them as much good as their rash did them harm
for the gallei come up with them in a littl more than half a mile
threw her oar over them and took the whole of them aliv the other
two gallei now join compani and all four return with the prize to
the beach where a vast multitud stood wait for them eager to see
what thei brought back the gener anchor close in and perceiv
that the viceroi of the citi wa on the shore he order the skiff to
push off to fetch him and the yard to be lower for the purpos of
hang forthwith the rai and the rest of the men taken on board the
vessel about sixandthirti in number all smart fellow and most of
them turkish musket he ask which wa the rai of the brigantin
and wa answer in spanish by on of the prison who afterward
prove to be a spanish renegad thi young man seor that you see
here is our rai and he point to on of the handsomest and most
gallantlook youth that could be imagin he did not seem to be
twenti year of ag
tell me dog said the gener what led thee to kill my soldier
when thou sawest it wa imposs for thee to escap is that the wai
to behav to chief gallei knowest thou not that rash is not
valour faint prospect of success should make men bold but not rash
the rai wa about to repli but the gener could not at that moment
listen to him as he had to hasten to receiv the viceroi who wa now
come on board the gallei and with him certain of hi attend and
some of the peopl
you have had a good chase seor gener said the viceroi
your excel shall soon see how good by the game strung up to thi
yard repli the gener

becaus said the gener against all law reason and usag of
war thei have kill on my hand two of the best soldier on board
these gallei and i have sworn to hang everi man that i have taken
but abov all thi youth who is the rai of the brigantin and he
point to him as he stood with hi hand alreadi bound and the rope
round hi neck readi for death
the viceroi look at him and see him so wellfavour so
grace and so submiss he felt a desir to spare hi life the
comeli of the youth furnish him at onc with a letter of
recommend he therefor question him sai tell me rai
art thou turk moor or renegad

vengeanc will not lose much by wait while i tell you the stori of
my life
what heart could be so hard as not to be soften by these word at
ani rate so far as to listen to what the unhappi youth had to sai the
gener bade him sai what he pleas but not to expect pardon for hi
flagrant offenc with thi permiss the youth began in these word
born of morisco parent i am of that nation more unhappi than wise
upon which of late a sea of woe ha pour down in the cours of our
misfortun i wa carri to barbari by two uncl of mine for it wa
in vain that i declar i wa a christian as in fact i am and not a
mere pretend on or outwardli but a true cathol christian it
avail me noth with those charg with our sad expatri to
protest thi nor would my uncl believ it on the contrari thei
treat it as an untruth and a subterfug set up to enabl me to remain
behind in the land of my birth and so more by forc than of my own
will thei took me with them i had a christian mother and a father
who wa a man of sound sens and a christian too i imbib the
cathol faith with my mother milk i wa well brought up and
neither in word nor in deed did i i think show ani sign of be a
morisco to accompani these virtu for such i hold them my beauti
if i possess ani grew with my growth and great as wa the seclus
in which i live it wa not so great but that a young gentleman don
gaspar gregorio by name eldest son of a gentleman who is lord of a
villag near our contriv to find opportun of see me how he
saw me how we met how hi heart wa lost to me and mine not kept
from him would take too long to tell especi at a moment when i am
in dread of the cruel cord that threaten me interpos between tongu
and throat i will onli sai therefor that don gregorio chose to
accompani me in our banish he join compani with the morisco
who were go forth from other villag for he knew their languag
veri well and on the voyag he struck up a friendship with my two
uncl who were carri me with them for my father like a wise and
farsight man as soon as he heard the first edict for our expuls
quit the villag and depart in quest of some refug for us abroad
he left hidden and buri at a spot of which i alon have knowledg a
larg quantiti of pearl and preciou stone of great valu togeth
with a sum of monei in gold cruzado and doubloon he charg me on
no account to touch the treasur if by ani chanc thei expel us
befor hi return i obei him and with my uncl as i have said
and other of our kindr and neighbour pass over to barbari and
the place where we took up our abod wa algier much the same as if
we had taken it up in hell itself the king heard of my beauti and
report told him of my wealth which wa in some degre fortun for
me he summon me befor him and ask me what part of spain i came
from and what monei and jewel i had i mention the place and told
him the jewel and monei were buri there but that thei might easili
be recov if i myself went back for them all thi i told him in
dread lest my beauti and not hi own covet should influenc him
while he wa engag in convers with me thei brought him word
that in compani with me wa on of the handsomest and most grace
youth that could be imagin i knew at onc that thei were speak
of don gaspar gregorio whose comeli surpass the most highli
vaunt beauti i wa troubl when i thought of the danger he wa in
for among those barbar turk a fair youth is more esteem than a
woman be she ever so beauti the king immedi order him to be
brought befor him that he might see him and ask me if what thei
said about the youth wa true i then almost as if inspir by heaven
told him it wa but that i would have him to know it wa not a man
but a woman like myself and i entreat him to allow me to go and
dress her in the attir proper to her so that her beauti might be seen
to perfect and that she might present herself befor him with less
embarrass he bade me go by all mean and said that the next dai
we should discuss the plan to be adopt for my return to spain to
carri awai the hidden treasur i saw don gaspar i told him the danger
he wa in if he let it be seen he wa a man i dress him as a moorish
woman and that same afternoon i brought him befor the king who wa
charm when he saw him and resolv to keep the damsel and make a
present of her to the grand signor and to avoid the risk she might run
among the women of hi seraglio and distrust of himself he
command her to be place in the hous of some moorish ladi of rank
who would protect and attend to her and thither he wa taken at onc
what we both suffer for i cannot deni that i love him mai be left
to the imagin of those who ar separ if thei love on anoth
dearli the king then arrang that i should return to spain in thi
brigantin and that two turk those who kill your soldier should
accompani me there also came with me thi spanish renegadeand here
she point to him who had first spokenwhom i know to be secretli a
christian and to be more desir of be left in spain than of
return to barbari the rest of the crew of the brigantin ar moor
and turk who mere serv as rower the two turk greedi and
insol instead of obei the order we had to land me and thi
renegad in christian dress with which we came provid on the first
spanish ground we came to chose to run along the coast and make some
prize if thei could fear that if thei put us ashor first we
might in case of some accid befal us make it known that the
brigantin wa at sea and thu if there happen to be ani gallei on
the coast thei might be taken we sight thi shore last night and
know noth of these gallei we were discov and the result
wa what you have seen to sum up there is don gregorio in woman
dress among women in immin danger of hi life and here am i with
hand bound in expect or rather in dread of lose my life of
which i am alreadi weari here sir end my sad stori as true as it

which those of my nation ar guilti and she stood silent her ey
fill with move tear accompani by plenti from the bystand
the viceroi touch with compass went up to her without speak
and unti the cord that bound the hand of the moorish girl
but all the while the morisco christian wa tell her strang stori
an elderli pilgrim who had come on board of the gallei at the same
time as the viceroi kept hi ey fix upon her and the instant she
ceas speak he threw himself at her feet and embrac them said
in a voic broken by sob and sigh o ana felix my unhappi daughter

and look at the pilgrim he recognis in him that same ricot he met
the dai he quit hi govern and felt satisfi that thi wa hi

with hi while he address the gener and the viceroi said thi
sir is my daughter more unhappi in her adventur than in her name
she is ana felix surnam ricot celebr as much for her own
beauti as for my wealth i quit my nativ land in search of some
shelter or refug for us abroad and have found on in germani i

kind charm as well by her beauti as by her intellig for in
both respect the fair morisco wa richli endow and all the peopl
of the citi flock to see her as though thei had been summon by the
ring of the bell
don quixot told don antonio that the plan adopt for releas don
gregorio wa not a good on for it risk were greater than it
advantag and that it would be better to land himself with hi arm
and hors in barbari for he would carri him off in spite of the whole
moorish host as don gaifero carri off hi wife melisendra
rememb your worship observ sancho on hear him sai so seor
don gaifero carri off hi wife from the mainland and took her to
franc by land but in thi case if by chanc we carri off don
gregorio we have no wai of bring him to spain for there the sea
between
there a remedi for everyth except death said don quixot if
thei bring the vessel close to the shore we shall be abl to get on
board though all the world strive to prevent us
your worship hit it off mighti well and mighti easi said sancho
but it a long step from sai to do and i hold to the
renegad for he seem to me an honest goodheart fellow
don antonio then said that if the renegad did not prove success
the expedi of the great don quixot expedit to barbari should
be adopt two dai afterward the renegad put to sea in a light
vessel of six oar asid man by a stout crew and two dai later
the gallei made sail eastward the gener have beg the viceroi
to let him know all about the releas of don gregorio and about ana
felix and the viceroi promis to do as he request
on morn as don quixot went out for a stroll along the beach
arrai in full armour for as he often said that wa hi onli gear
hi onli rest the frai and he never wa without it for a moment he
saw come toward him a knight also in full armour with a shine
moon paint on hi shield who on approach suffici near to be
heard said in a loud voic address himself to don quixot
illustri knight and never suffici extol don quixot of la

don quixot wa amaz and astonish as well at the knight of the
white moon arrog as at hi reason for deliv the defianc
and with calm digniti he answer him knight of the white moon of
whose achiev i have never heard until now i will ventur to
swear you have never seen the illustri dulcinea for had you seen
her i know you would have taken care not to ventur yourself upon thi
issu becaus the sight would have remov all doubt from your mind
that there ever ha been or can be a beauti to be compar with her
and so not sai you lie but mere that you ar not correct in what

a sudden in thi wai the knight of the white moon repli that it wa
a question of preced of beauti and briefli told him what he had
said to don quixot and how the condit of the defianc agre upon
on both side had been accept the viceroi went over to don antonio
and ask in a low voic did he know who the knight of the white moon
wa or wa it some joke thei were plai on don quixot don antonio
repli that he neither knew who he wa nor whether the defianc wa in

fell back sai if there be no other wai out of it gallant
knight except to confess or die and don quixot is inflex and
your worship of the white moon still more so in god hand be it and

he of the white moon thank the viceroi in courteou and wellchosen

then commend himself with all hi heart to heaven and to hi
dulcinea as wa hi custom on the ev of ani combat that await him
proceed to take a littl more distanc as he saw hi antagonist wa
do the same then without blast of trumpet or other warlik
instrument to give them the signal to charg both at the same instant
wheel their hors and he of the white moon be the swifter met
don quixot after have travers twothird of the cours and there
encount him with such violenc that without touch him with hi
lanc for he held it high to all appear purpos he hurl don

remov hi armour and he shut himself into a lower room still
attend by don antonio whose bread would not bake until he had found
out who he wa he of the white moon see then that the gentleman
would not leav him said i know veri well seor what you have come
for it is to find out who i am and as there is no reason why i should
conceal it from you while my servant here is take off my armour i
will tell you the true state of the case without leav out anyth
you must know seor that i am call the bachelor samson carrasco i
am of the same villag as don quixot of la mancha whose craze and
folli make all of us who know him feel piti for him and i am on of
those who have felt it most and persuad that hi chanc of recoveri
lai in quiet and keep at home and in hi own hous i hit upon a
devic for keep him there three month ago therefor i went out
to meet him as a knighterr under the assum name of the knight of
the mirror intend to engag him in combat and overcom him without
hurt him make it the condit of our combat that the vanquish
should be at the dispos of the victor what i meant to demand of him
for i regard him as vanquish alreadi wa that he should return to
hi own villag and not leav it for a whole year by which time he
might be cure but fate order it otherwis for he vanquish me and
unhors me and so my plan fail he went hi wai and i came back
conquer cover with shame and sore bruis by my fall which wa
a particularli danger on but thi did not quench my desir to meet
him again and overcom him as you have seen todai and as he is so

no doubt in order to keep hi word obei the injunct i have laid
upon him thi seor is how the matter stand and i have noth
more to tell you i implor of you not to betrai me or tell don
quixot who i am so that my honest endeavour mai be success and
that a man of excel witswer he onli rid of the fooleri of
chivalrymai get them back again
o seor said don antonio mai god forgiv you the wrong you have
done the whole world in try to bring the most amus madman in it
back to hi sens do you not see seor that the gain by don
quixot saniti can never equal the enjoy hi craze give but my
belief is that all the seor bachelor pain will be of no avail to
bring a man so hopelessli crack to hi sens again and if it were
not uncharit i would sai mai don quixot never be cure for by
hi recoveri we lose not onli hi own drolleri but hi squir sancho
panza too ani on of which is enough to turn melancholi itself into
merriment howev ill hold my peac and sai noth to him and
well see whether i am right in my suspicion that seor carrasco
effort will be fruitless
the bachelor repli that at all event the affair promis well and
he hope for a happi result from it and put hi servic at don

out of sort brood over the unhappi event of hi defeat sancho
strove to comfort him and among other thing he said to him hold up
your head seor and be of good cheer if you can and give thank to
heaven that if you have had a tumbl to the ground you have not come
off with a broken rib and as you know that where thei give thei
take and that there ar not alwai fletch where there ar peg a
fig for the doctor for there no need of him to cure thi ailment
let us go home and give over go about in search of adventur in
strang land and place rightli look at it is i that am the
greater loser though it is your worship that ha had the wors usag
with the govern i gave up all wish to be a governor again but i
did not give up all long to be a count and that will never come to

don quixot cheer up a littl and said of a truth i am almost readi
to sai i should have been glad had it turn out just the other wai
for it would have oblig me to cross over to barbari where by the
might of my arm i should have restor to liberti not onli don
gregorio but all the christian captiv there ar in barbari but what
am i sai miser be that i am am i not he that ha been

distaff than the sword
no more of that seor said sancho let the hen live even though
it be with her pip todai for thee and tomorrow for me in these
affair of encount and whack on must not mind them for he that
fall todai mai get up tomorrow unless inde he choos to lie in
bed i mean give wai to weak and doe not pluck up fresh spirit
for fresh battl let your worship get up now to receiv don gregorio
for the household seem to be in a bustl and no doubt he ha come by
thi time and so it prove for as soon as don gregorio and the
renegad had given the viceroi an account of the voyag out and home
don gregorio eager to see ana felix came with the renegad to don
antonio hous when thei carri him awai from algier he wa in
woman dress on board the vessel howev he exchang it for that

look like on to be love and serv and esteem for he wa
surpassingli wellfavour and to judg by appear some seventeen
or eighteen year of ag ricot and hi daughter came out to welcom
him the father with tear the daughter with bash thei did not
embrac each other for where there is deep love there will never be
overmuch bold seen side by side the comeli of don gregorio
and the beauti of ana felix were the admir of all who were
present it wa silenc that spoke for the lover at that moment and
their ey were the tongu that declar their pure and happi
feel the renegad explain the measur and mean he had adopt
to rescu don gregorio and don gregorio at no great length but in a
few word in which he show that hi intellig wa in advanc of
hi year describ the peril and embarrass he found himself in
among the women with whom he had sojourn to conclud ricot
liber recompens and reward as well the renegad as the men who
had row and the renegad effect hi readmiss into the bodi of
the church and wa reconcil with it and from a rotten limb becam by
penanc and repent a clean and sound on
two dai later the viceroi discuss with don antonio the step thei
should take to enabl ana felix and her father to stai in spain for it
seem to them there could be no object to a daughter who wa so
good a christian and a father to all appear so well dispos
remain there don antonio offer to arrang the matter at the
capit whither he wa compel to go on some other busi hint
that mani a difficult affair wa settl there with the help of favour
and bribe
nai said ricot who wa present dure the convers it will
not do to reli upon favour or bribe becaus with the great don
bernardino de velasco cond de salazar to whom hi majesti ha
entrust our expuls neither entreati nor promis bribe nor
appeal to compass ar of ani us for though it is true he mingl
merci with justic still see that the whole bodi of our nation is
taint and corrupt he appli to it the cauteri that burn rather
than the salv that sooth and thu by prudenc sagac care and
the fear he inspir he ha born on hi mighti shoulder the weight
of thi great polici and carri it into effect all our scheme and
plot importun and wile be ineffectu to blind hi argu
ey ever on the watch lest on of us should remain behind in
conceal and like a hidden root come in cours of time to sprout
and bear poison fruit in spain now cleans and reliev of the
fear in which our vast number kept it heroic resolv of the great
philip the third and unparallel wisdom to have entrust it to the
said don bernardino de velasco
at ani rate said don antonio when i am there i will make all
possibl effort and let heaven do as pleas it best don gregorio
will come with me to reliev the anxieti which hi parent must be
suffer on account of hi absenc ana felix will remain in my hous
with my wife or in a monasteri and i know the viceroi will be glad
that the worthi ricot should stai with him until we see what term i
can make
the viceroi agre to all that wa propos but don gregorio on
learn what had pass declar he could not and would not on ani
account leav ana felix howev as it wa hi purpos to go and see
hi parent and devis some wai of return for her he fell in with
the propos arrang ana felix remain with don antonio wife
and ricot in the viceroi hous
the dai for don antonio departur came and two dai later that for
don quixot and sancho for don quixot fall did not suffer him
to take the road sooner there were tear and sigh swoon and
sob at the part between don gregorio and ana felix ricot offer
don gregorio a thousand crown if he would have them but he would not

seor said sancho on hear thi it is the part of brave heart
to be patient in advers just as much as to be glad in prosper i
judg by myself for if when i wa a governor i wa glad now that i
am a squir and on foot i am not sad and i have heard sai that she
whom commonli thei call fortun is a drunken whimsic jade and what
is more blind and therefor neither see what she doe nor know
whom she cast down or whom she set up
thou art a great philosoph sancho said don quixot thou
speakest veri sensibl i know not who taught thee but i can tell thee
there is no such thing as fortun in the world nor doe anyth which
take place there be it good or bad come about by chanc but by the
special preordin of heaven and henc the common sai that each
of us is the maker of hi own fortun i have been that of mine but
not with the proper amount of prudenc and my selfconfid ha
therefor made me pai dearli for i ought to have reflect that
rocinant feebl strength could not resist the mighti bulk of the
knight of the white moon hors in a word i ventur it i did my
best i wa overthrown but though i lost my honour i did not lose nor
can i lose the virtu of keep my word when i wa a knighterr
dare and valiant i support my achiev by hand and deed and
now that i am a humbl squir i will support my word by keep the
promis i have given forward then sancho my friend let us go to keep
the year of the noviti in our own countri and in that seclus we
shall pick up fresh strength to return to the by me neverforgotten
call of arm
seor return sancho travel on foot is not such a pleasant
thing that it make me feel dispos or tempt to make long march
let us leav thi armour hung up on some tree instead of someon that
ha been hang and then with me on dappl back and my feet off the
ground we will arrang the stage as your worship pleas to measur
them out but to suppos that i am go to travel on foot and make
long on is to suppos nonsens
thou sayest well sancho said don quixot let my armour be hung up
for a trophi and under it or round it we will carv on the tree what
wa inscrib on the trophi of roland armour
these let none move
who dareth not hi might with roland prove
that the veri thing said sancho and if it wa not that we should
feel the want of rocinant on the road it would be as well to leav
him hung up too
and yet i had rather not have either him or the armour hung up said
don quixot that it mai not be said for good servic a bad
return
your worship is right said sancho for as sensibl peopl hold
the fault of the ass must not be laid on the packsaddl and as in
thi affair the fault is your worship punish yourself and dont let
your anger break out against the alreadi batter and bloodi armour or
the meek of rocinant or the tender of my feet try to make
them travel more than is reason

in convers of thi sort the whole of that dai went by as did the four
succeed on without anyth occur to interrupt their journei
but on the fifth as thei enter a villag thei found a great number of
peopl at the door of an inn enjoi themselv as it wa a holidai
upon don quixot approach a peasant call out on of these two
gentlemen who come here and who dont know the parti will tell us
what we ought to do about our wager
that i will certainli said don quixot and accord to the
right of the case if i can manag to understand it
well here it is worthi sir said the peasant a man of thi
villag who is so fat that he weigh twenti stone challeng anoth a
neighbour of hi who doe not weigh more than nine to run a race the
agreement wa that thei were to run a distanc of a hundr pace with
equal weight and when the challeng wa ask how the weight were
to be equalis he said that the other as he weigh nine stone
should put eleven in iron on hi back and that in thi wai the twenti
stone of the thin man would equal the twenti stone of the fat on
not at all exclaim sancho at onc befor don quixot could
answer it for me that onli a few dai ago left off be a
governor and a judg as all the world know to settl these doubt
question and give an opinion in disput of all sort
answer in god name sancho my friend said don quixot for i am
not fit to give crumb to a cat my wit ar so confus and upset
with thi permiss sancho said to the peasant who stood cluster
round him wait with open mouth for the decis to come from hi
brother what the fat man requir is not in reason nor ha it a
shadow of justic in it becaus if it be true as thei sai that the
challeng mai choos the weapon the other ha no right to choos
such as will prevent and keep him from win my decis therefor
is that the fat challeng prune peel thin trim and correct himself
and take eleven stone of hi flesh off hi bodi here or there as he
pleas and as suit him best and be in thi wai reduc to nine
stone weight he will make himself equal and even with nine stone of
hi oppon and thei will be abl to run on equal term
by all that good said on of the peasant as he heard sancho
decis but the gentleman ha spoken like a saint and given
judgment like a canon but ill be bound the fat man wont part with an
ounc of hi flesh not to sai eleven stone
the best plan will be for them not to run said anoth so that
neither the thin man break down under the weight nor the fat on strip
himself of hi flesh let half the wager be spent in wine and let
take these gentlemen to the tavern where there the best and over me
be the cloak when it rain
i thank you sir said don quixot but i cannot stop for an
instant for sad thought and unhappi circumst forc me to seem
discourt and to travel apac and spur rocinant he push on
leav them wonder at what thei had seen and heard at hi own
strang figur and at the shrewd of hi servant for such thei took
sancho to be and anoth of them observ if the servant is so
clever what must the master be ill bet if thei ar go to
salamanca to studi theyll come to be alcald of the court in a
trice for it a mere jokeonli to read and read and have interest
and good luck and befor a man know where he is he find himself with
a staff in hi hand or a mitr on hi head
that night master and man pass out in the field in the open air and
the next dai as thei were pursu their journei thei saw come
toward them a man on foot with alforja at the neck and a javelin or
spike staff in hi hand the veri cut of a foot courier who as soon
as he came close to don quixot increas hi pace and half run

differ result for as soon as your worship had left the castl my
lord the duke had a hundr stroke of the stick given me for have
act contrari to the order he gave me befor engag in the combat
and the end of the whole affair is that the girl ha becom a nun and
doa rodriguez ha gone back to castil and i am now on my wai to

turn upon the disenchant of dulcinea other upon the life he wa
about to lead in hi enforc retir sancho came up and spoke in
high prais of the gener disposit of the lacquei tosilo
is it possibl sancho said don quixot that thou dost still think
that he yonder is a real lacquei appar it ha escap thy memori
that thou hast seen dulcinea turn and transform into a peasant
wench and the knight of the mirror into the bachelor carrasco all
the work of the enchant that persecut me but tell me now didst
thou ask thi tosilo as thou callest him what ha becom of
altisidora did she weep over my absenc or ha she alreadi consign

the thought that i had said sancho were not such as to leav time
for ask fool question bodi o me seor is your worship in a
condit now to inquir into other peopl thought abov all love

look ye sancho said don quixot there is a great differ
between what is done out of love and what is done out of gratitud a
knight mai veri possibl be proof against love but it is imposs
strictli speak for him to be ungrat altisidora to all
appear love me truli she gave me the three kerchief thou
knowest of she wept at my departur she curs me she abus me
cast shame to the wind she bewail herself in public all sign
that she ador me for the wrath of lover alwai end in curs i
had no hope to give her nor treasur to offer her for mine ar
given to dulcinea and the treasur of knightserr ar like those
of the fairi illusori and decept all i can give her is the
place in my memori i keep for her without prejudic howev to that
which i hold devot to dulcinea whom thou art wrong by thy
remiss in whip thyself and scourg that fleshwould that i
saw it eaten by wolveswhich would rather keep itself for the worm
than for the relief of that poor ladi
seor repli sancho if the truth is to be told i cannot persuad
myself that the whip of my backsid ha anyth to do with the
disenchant of the enchant it is like sai if your head ach
rub ointment on your knee at ani rate ill make bold to swear that
in all the histori deal with knighterrantri that your worship ha
read you have never come across anybodi disench by whip but
whether or no ill whip myself when i have a fanci for it and the
opportun serv for scourg myself comfort
god grant it said don quixot and heaven give thee grace to take
it to heart and own the oblig thou art under to help my ladi who
is thine also inasmuch as thou art mine
as thei pursu their journei talk in thi wai thei came to the veri
same spot where thei had been trampl on by the bull don quixot
recognis it and said he to sancho thi is the meadow where we came
upon those gai shepherdess and gallant shepherd who were try to
reviv and imit the pastor arcadia there an idea as novel as it
wa happi in emul whereof if so be thou dost approv of it
sancho i would have ourselv turn shepherd at ani rate for the time
i have to live in retir i will bui some ew and everyth els
requisit for the pastor call and i under the name of the
shepherd quixot and thou as the shepherd panzino we will roam the
wood and grove and meadow sing song here lament in elegi
there drink of the crystal water of the spring or limpid brook
or flow river the oak will yield us their sweet fruit with
bounti hand the trunk of the hard cork tree a seat the willow
shade the rose perfum the widespread meadow carpet tint with a
thousand dye the clear pure air will give us breath the moon and
star lighten the dark of the night for us song shall be our
delight lament our joi apollo will suppli us with vers and love
with conceit wherebi we shall make ourselv fame for ever not onli
in thi but in ag to come
egad said sancho but that sort of life squar nai corner with
my notion and what is more the bachelor samson carrasco and master
nichola the barber wont have well seen it befor theyll want to
follow it and turn shepherd along with us and god grant it mai not
come into the curat head to join the sheepfold too he so jovial
and fond of enjoi himself
thou art in the right of it sancho said don quixot and the
bachelor samson carrasco if he enter the pastor fratern as no
doubt he will mai call himself the shepherd samsonino or perhap the
shepherd carrascon nichola the barber mai call himself niculoso as
old boscan formerli wa call nemoroso as for the curat i dont know
what name we can fit to him unless it be someth deriv from hi
titl and we call him the shepherd curiambro for the shepherdess
whose lover we shall be we can pick name as we would pear and as
my ladi name doe just as well for a shepherdesss as for a
princesss i need not troubl myself to look for on that will suit
her better to thine sancho thou canst give what name thou wilt
i dont mean to give her ani but teresona said sancho which will
go well with her stout and with her own right name as she is
call teresa and then when i sing her prais in my vers ill show
how chast my passion is for im not go to look for better bread
than ever came from wheat in other men hous it wont do for the
curat to have a shepherdess for the sake of good exampl and if the
bachelor choos to have on that is hi lookout
god bless me sancho my friend said don quixot what a life we
shall lead what hautboi and zamora bagpip we shall hear what
tabor timbrel and rebeck and then if among all these differ
sort of music that of the albogu is heard almost all the pastor
instrument will be there
what ar albogu ask sancho for i never in my life heard tell
of them or saw them
albogu said don quixot ar brass plate like candlestick that
struck against on anoth on the hollow side make a nois which if
not veri pleas or harmoni is not disagre and accord veri
well with the rude note of the bagpip and tabor the word albogu is
morisco as ar all those in our spanish tongu that begin with al
for exampl almohaza almorzar alhombra alguacil alhucema
almacen alcancia and other of the same sort of which there ar not
mani more our languag ha onli three that ar morisco and end in i
which ar borcegu zaquizam and marav alhel and alfaqu
ar seen to be arab as well by the al at the begin as by the
thei end with i mention thi incident the chanc allus to
albogu have remind me of it and it will be of great assist
to us in the perfect practic of thi call that i am someth of a
poet as thou knowest and that besid the bachelor samson carrasco is
an accomplish on of the curat i sai noth but i will wager he
ha some spice of the poet in him and no doubt master nichola too
for all barber or most of them ar guitar player and stringer of
vers i will bewail my separ thou shalt glorifi thyself as a
constant lover the shepherd carrascon will figur as a reject on
and the curat curiambro as whatev mai pleas him best and so all
will go as gaili as heart could wish
to thi sancho made answer i am so unlucki seor that im afraid

sanchica will bring us our dinner to the pastur but staysh
goodlook and shepherd there ar with more mischief than
simplic in them i would not have her come for wool and go back

purpos and when i quot them thei fit like a ring to the finger thou
bringest them in by the head and shoulder in such a wai that thou
dost drag them in rather than introduc them if i am not mistaken i
have told thee alreadi that proverb ar short maxim drawn from the
experi and observ of our wise men of old but the proverb that
is not to the purpos is a piec of nonsens and not a maxim but
enough of thi as nightfal is draw on let us retir some littl
distanc from the high road to pass the night what is in store for us
tomorrow god knoweth

restless so much so that he awok sancho and said to him i am
amaz sancho at the unconcern of thy tempera i believ thou art

whatev i lie awak while thou sleepest i weep while thou singest i

invit us to break our slumber by a vigil of some sort rise as thou
livest and retir a littl distanc and with a good heart and
cheer courag give thyself three or four hundr lash on account
of dulcinea disenchant score and thi i entreat of thee make
it a request for i have no desir to come to grip with thee a second
time as i know thou hast a heavi hand as soon as thou hast laid them
on we will pass the rest of the night i sing my separ thou
thy constanc make a begin at onc with the pastor life we ar
to follow at our villag
seor repli sancho im no monk to get up out of the middl of my
sleep and scourg myself nor doe it seem to me that on can pass from
on extrem of the pain of whip to the other of music will your
worship let me sleep and not worri me about whip myself or youll
make me swear never to touch a hair of my doublet not to sai my

and those i mean to do thee through me hast thou seen thyself a
governor and through me thou seest thyself in immedi expect of
be a count or obtain some other equival titl for ipost
tenebra spero lucem
i dont know what that is said sancho all i know is that so long
as i am asleep i have neither fear nor hope troubl nor glori and
good luck betid him that invent sleep the cloak that cover over
all a man thought the food that remov hunger the drink that
drive awai thirst the fire that warm the cold the cold that temper
the heat and to wind up with the univers coin wherewith everyth
is bought the weight and balanc that make the shepherd equal with
the king and the fool with the wise man sleep i have heard sai ha
onli on fault that it is like death for between a sleep man and a
dead man there is veri littl differ
never have i heard thee speak so elegantli as now sancho said don
quixot and here i begin to see the truth of the proverb thou dost
sometim quot not with whom thou art bred but with whom thou art
fed
ha by my life master mine said sancho it not i that am
string proverb now for thei drop in pair from your worship
mouth faster than from mine onli there is thi differ between mine
and your that your ar welltim and mine ar untim but anyhow
thei ar all proverb
at thi point thei becam awar of a harsh indistinct nois that seem
to spread through all the vallei around don quixot stood up and laid
hi hand upon hi sword and sancho ensconc himself under dappl and
put the bundl of armour on on side of him and the asss packsaddl
on the other in fear and trembl as great as don quixot
perturb each instant the nois increas and came nearer to the
two terrifi men or at least to on for as to the other hi courag
is known to all the fact of the matter wa that some men were take
abov six hundr pig to sell at a fair and were on their wai with
them at that hour and so great wa the nois thei made and their
grunt and blow that thei deafen the ear of don quixot and
sancho panza and thei could not make out what it wa the widespread
grunt drove came on in a surg mass and without show ani
respect for don quixot digniti or sancho pass right over the
pair of them demolish sancho entrench and not onli
upset don quixot but sweep rocinant off hi feet into the
bargain and what with the trampl and the grunt and the pace at
which the unclean beast went packsaddl armour dappl and
rocinant were left scatter on the ground and sancho and don quixot
at their wit end
sancho got up as well as he could and beg hi master to give him hi
sword sai he want to kill half a dozen of those dirti unmannerli
pig for he had by thi time found out that that wa what thei were
let them be my friend said don quixot thi insult is the penalti
of my sin and it is the righteou chastis of heaven that jackal
should devour a vanquish knight and wasp sting him and pig trampl
him under foot
i suppos it is the chastis of heaven too said sancho that
fli should prick the squir of vanquish knight and lice eat
them and hunger assail them if we squir were the son of the
knight we serv or their veri near relat it would be no wonder
if the penalti of their misde overtook us even to the fourth
gener but what have the panza to do with the quixot well
well let lie down again and sleep out what littl of the night
there left and god will send us dawn and we shall be all right

littl madrig which unknown to thee i compos in my head last
night
i should think said sancho that the thought that allow on to
make vers cannot be of great consequ let your worship string
vers as much as you like and ill sleep as much as i can and
forthwith take the space of ground he requir he muffl himself
up and fell into a sound sleep undisturb by bond debt or troubl
of ani sort don quixot prop up against the trunk of a beech or a
cork treefor cide hamet doe not specifi what kind of tree it
wassang in thi strain to the accompani of hi own sigh

to death i flee
in hope therein the end of all to find
but draw near

sancho slept that night in a cot in the same chamber with don quixot
a thing he would have gladli excus if he could for he knew veri well
that with question and answer hi master would not let him sleep and
he wa in no humour for talk much as he still felt the pain of hi
late martyrdom which interf with hi freedom of speech and it
would have been more to hi tast to sleep in a hovel alon than in
that luxuri chamber in compani and so well found did hi
apprehens prove and so correct wa hi anticip that scarc
had hi master got into bed when he said what dost thou think of
tonight adventur sancho great and mighti is the power of
coldheart scorn for thou with thine own ey hast seen altisidora
slain not by arrow nor by the sword nor by ani warlik weapon nor
by deadli poison but by the thought of the stern and scorn with
which i have alwai treat her
she might have di and welcom said sancho when she pleas and
how she pleas and she might have left me alon for i never made her
fall in love or scorn her i dont know nor can i imagin how the
recoveri of altisidora a damsel more fanci than wise can have as
i have said befor anyth to do with the suffer of sancho panza
now i begin to see plainli and clearli that there ar enchant and
enchant peopl in the world and mai god deliv me from them sinc
i cant deliv myself and so i beg of your worship to let me sleep
and not ask me ani more question unless you want me to throw myself
out of the window
sleep sancho my friend said don quixot if the pinprod and
pinch thou hast receiv and the smack administ to thee will let
thee
no pain came up to the insult of the smack said sancho for the
simpl reason that it wa duenna confound them that gave them to me
but onc more i entreat your worship to let me sleep for sleep is
relief from miseri to those who ar miser when awak
be it so and god be with thee said don quixot
thei fell asleep both of them and cide hamet the author of thi
great histori took thi opportun to record and relat what it wa
that induc the duke and duchess to get up the elabor plot that ha
been describ the bachelor samson carrasco he sai not forget
how he as the knight of the mirror had been vanquish and overthrown
by don quixot which defeat and overthrow upset all hi plan
resolv to try hi hand again hope for better luck than he had
befor and so have learn where don quixot wa from the page who
brought the letter and present to sancho wife teresa panza he got
himself new armour and anoth hors and put a white moon upon hi
shield and to carri hi arm he had a mule led by a peasant not by
tom cecial hi former squir for fear he should be recognis by sancho
or don quixot he came to the duke castl and the duke inform him
of the road and rout don quixot had taken with the intent of be
present at the joust at saragossa he told him too of the joke he
had practis upon him and of the devic for the disenchant of
dulcinea at the expens of sancho backsid and final he gave him
an account of the trick sancho had plai upon hi master make him
believ that dulcinea wa enchant and turn into a countri wench
and of how the duchess hi wife had persuad sancho that it wa he
himself who wa deceiv inasmuch as dulcinea wa realli enchant at
which the bachelor laugh not a littl and marvel as well at the
sharp and simplic of sancho as at the length to which don
quixot mad went the duke beg of him if he found him whether
he overcam him or not to return that wai and let him know the result
thi the bachelor did he set out in quest of don quixot and not
find him at saragossa he went on and how he fare ha been alreadi
told he return to the duke castl and told him all what the
condit of the combat were and how don quixot wa now like a
loyal knighterr return to keep hi promis of retir to hi
villag for a year by which time said the bachelor he might perhap
be cure of hi mad for that wa the object that had led him to
adopt these disguis as it wa a sad thing for a gentleman of such
good part as don quixot to be a madman and so he took hi leav of
the duke and went home to hi villag to wait there for don quixot
who wa come after him thereupon the duke seiz the opportun of
practis thi mystif upon him so much did he enjoi everyth
connect with sancho and don quixot he had the road about the
castl far and near everywher he thought don quixot wa like to
pass on hi return occupi by larg number of hi servant on foot
and on horseback who were to bring him to the castl by fair mean or

altisidora to be place on the catafalqu with all the pomp and
ceremoni that ha been describ the whole affair be so well

had worn on the catafalqu and in a robe of white taffeta embroid
with gold flower her hair flow loos over her shoulder and
lean upon a staff of fine black eboni don quixot disconcert and
in confus at her appear huddl himself up and wellnigh
cover himself altogeth with the sheet and counterpan of the bed
tongueti and unabl to offer her ani civil altisidora seat
herself on a chair at the head of the bed and after a deep sigh said
to him in a feebl soft voic when women of rank and modest maiden
trampl honour under foot and give a loos to the tongu that break
through everi impedi publish abroad the inmost secret of their
heart thei ar reduc to sore extrem such a on am i seor
don quixot of la mancha crush conquer lovesmitten but yet
patient under suffer and virtuou and so much so that my heart
broke with grief and i lost my life for the last two dai i have been
dead slain by the thought of the cruelti with which thou hast treat
me obdur knight
o harder thou than marbl to my plaint
or at least believ to be dead by all who saw me and had it not been
that love take piti on me let my recoveri rest upon the suffer
of thi good squir there i should have remain in the other world
love might veri well have let it rest upon the suffer of my ass
and i should have been oblig to him said sancho but tell me
seoraand mai heaven send you a tender lover than my masterwhat did
you see in the other world what goe on in hell for of cours that
where on who di in despair is bound for
to tell you the truth said altisidora i cannot have di outright
for i did not go into hell had i gone in it is veri certain i should
never have come out again do what i might the truth is i came to the
gate where some dozen or so of devil were plai tenni all in
breech and doublet with fall collar trim with flemish
bonelac and ruffl of the same that serv them for wristband with
four finger breadth of the arm expos to make their hand look
longer in their hand thei held racket of fire but what amaz me
still more wa that book appar full of wind and rubbish serv
them for tenni ball a strang and marvel thing thi howev
did not astonish me so much as to observ that although with player
it is usual for the winner to be glad and the loser sorri there in
that game all were growl all were snarl and all were curs
on anoth that no wonder said sancho for devil whether
plai or not can never be content win or lose
veri like said altisidora but there is anoth thing that
surpris me too i mean surpris me then and that wa that no ball
outlast the first throw or wa of ani us a second time and it wa
wonder the constant success there wa of book new and old to
on of them a brandnew wellbound on thei gave such a stroke that
thei knock the gut out of it and scatter the leav about look
what book that is said on devil to anoth and the other repli
it is the second part of the histori of don quixot of la mancha
not by cide hamet the origin author but by an aragones who by hi
own account is of tordesilla out of thi with it said the first
and into the depth of hell with it out of my sight is it so bad
said the other so bad is it said the first that if i had set
myself deliber to make a wors i could not have done it thei
then went on with their game knock other book about and i have
heard them mention the name of don quixot whom i love and ador so
took care to retain thi vision in my memori
a vision it must have been no doubt said don quixot for there is
no other i in the world thi histori ha been go about here for
some time from hand to hand but it doe not stai long in ani for
everybodi give it a tast of hi foot i am not disturb by hear
that i am wander in a fantast shape in the dark of the pit or
in the daylight abov for i am not the on that histori treat of if
it should be good faith and true it will have ag of life but
if it should be bad from it birth to it burial will not be a veri
long journei
altisidora wa about to proce with her complaint against don quixot
when he said to her i have sever time told you seora that it
griev me you should have set your affect upon me as from mine
thei can onli receiv gratitud but no return i wa born to belong to
dulcinea del toboso and the fate if there ar ani dedic me to
her and to suppos that ani other beauti can take the place she
occupi in my heart is to suppos an imposs thi frank
declar should suffic to make you retir within the bound of your
modesti for no on can bind himself to do imposs
hear thi altisidora with a show of anger and agit
exclaim god life don stockfish soul of a mortar stone of a
date more obstin and obdur than a clown ask a favour when he
ha hi mind made up if i fall upon you ill tear your ey out do
you fanci don vanquish don cudgel that i di for your sake
all that you have seen tonight ha been makebeliev im not the
woman to let the black of my nail suffer for such a camel much less
die
that i can well believ said sancho for all that about lover
pine to death is absurd thei mai talk of it but as for do
itjuda mai believ that
while thei were talk the musician singer and poet who had sung
the two stanza given abov came in and make a profound obeis to
don quixot said will your worship sir knight reckon and retain me
in the number of your most faith servant for i have long been a
great admir of your as well becaus of your fame as becaus of your
achiev will your worship tell me who you ar repli don
quixot so that my courtesi mai be answer to your desert the
young man repli that he wa the musician and songster of the night
befor of a truth said don quixot your worship ha a most
excel voic but what you sang did not seem to me veri much to the
purpos for what have garcilasso stanza to do with the death of
thi ladi
dont be surpris at that return the musician for with the
callow poet of our dai the wai is for everi on to write as he pleas
and pilfer where he choos whether it be german to the matter or
not and nowadai there is no piec of silli thei can sing or
write that is not set down to poetic licenc
don quixot wa about to repli but wa prevent by the duke and
duchess who came in to see him and with them there follow a long
and delight convers in the cours of which sancho said so mani
droll and sauci thing that he left the duke and duchess wonder not
onli at hi simplic but at hi sharp don quixot beg their
permiss to take hi departur that same dai inasmuch as for a
vanquish knight like himself it wa fitter he should live in a
pigsti than in a royal palac thei gave it veri readili and the
duchess ask him if altisidora wa in hi good grace
he repli seora let me tell your ladyship that thi damsel
ailment come entir of idl and the cure for it is honest and
constant employ she herself ha told me that lace is worn in hell
and as she must know how to make it let it never be out of her hand
for when she is occupi in shift the bobbin to and fro the imag
or imag of what she love will not shift to and fro in her thought
thi is the truth thi is my opinion and thi is my advic
and mine ad sancho for i never in all my life saw a lacemak
that di for love when damsel ar at work their mind ar more set
on finish their task than on think of their love i speak from
my own experi for when im dig i never think of my old woman
i mean my teresa panza whom i love better than my own eyelid you
sai well sancho said the duchess and i will take care that my
altisidora emploi herself henceforward in needlework of some sort for
she is extrem expert at it there is no occas to have recours
to that remedi seora said altisidora for the mere thought of the
cruelti with which thi vagabond villain ha treat me will suffic to
blot him out of my memori without ani other devic with your
highnesss leav i will retir not to have befor my ey i wont sai
hi rueful counten but hi abomin ugli look that remind
me of the common sai that he that rail is readi to forgiv
said the duke
altisidora then pretend to wipe awai her tear with a handkerchief
made an obeis to her master and mistress and quit the room
ill luck betid thee poor damsel said sancho ill luck betid
thee thou hast fallen in with a soul as dry as a rush and a heart as
hard as oak had it been me ifaith anoth cock would have crow to
thee
so the convers came to an end and don quixot dress himself and
dine with the duke and duchess and set out the same even

to thee freeli er thi i am not sure howev whether payment will
comport with the cure and i would not have the reward interfer with
the medicin i think there will be noth lost by try it consid
how much thou wouldst have sancho and whip thyself at onc and pai
thyself down with thine own hand as thou hast monei of mine
at thi propos sancho open hi ey and hi ear a palm breadth

if sancho repli don quixot i were to requit thee as the
import and natur of the cure deserv the treasur of venic
the mine of potosi would be insuffici to pai thee see what thou
hast of mine and put a price on each lash
of them said sancho there ar three thousand three hundr and
odd of these i have given myself five the rest remain let the five
go for the odd on and let us take the three thousand three hundr
which at a quarter real apiec for i will not take less though the
whole world should bid me make three thousand three hundr quarter
real the three thousand ar on thousand five hundr half real
which make seven hundr and fifti real and the three hundr make a
hundr and fifti half real which come to seventyf real which
ad to the seven hundr and fifti make eight hundr and twentyf
real in all these i will stop out of what i have belong to your

defeat a most happi triumph but look here sancho when wilt thou
begin the scourg for if thou wilt make short work of it i will
give thee a hundr real over and abov
when said sancho thi night without fail let your worship order
it so that we pass it out of door and in the open air and ill
scarifi myself
night long for by don quixot with the greatest anxieti in the
world came at last though it seem to him that the wheel of
apollo car had broken down and that the dai wa draw itself out
longer than usual just as is the case with lover who never make the
reckon of their desir agre with time thei made their wai at
length in among some pleasant tree that stood a littl distanc from
the road and there vacat rocinant saddl and dappl
packsaddl thei stretch themselv on the green grass and made
their supper off sancho store and he make a power and flexibl
whip out of dappl halter and headstal retreat about twenti pace
from hi master among some beech tree don quixot see him march
off with such resolut and spirit said to him take care my
friend not to cut thyself to piec allow the lash to wait for on
anoth and do not be in so great a hurri as to run thyself out of
breath midwai i mean do not lai on so strenuous as to make thy life
fail thee befor thou hast reach the desir number and that thou
mayest not lose by a card too much or too littl i will station myself
apart and count on my rosari here the lash thou givest thyself mai

pledg dont distress a good payer said sancho i mean to lai on
in such a wai as without kill myself to hurt myself for in that no

he then strip himself from the waist upward and snatch up the
rope he began to lai on and don quixot to count the lash he might
have given himself six or eight when he began to think the joke no
trifl and it price veri low and hold hi hand for a moment he
told hi master that he cri off on the score of a blind bargain for
each of those lash ought to be paid for at the rate of half a real
instead of a quarter
go on sancho my friend and be not dishearten said don quixot
for i doubl the stake as to price
in that case said sancho in god hand be it and let it rain
lash but the rogu no longer laid them on hi shoulder but laid
on to the tree with such groan everi now and then that on would
have thought at each of them hi soul wa be pluck up by the
root don quixot touch to the heart and fear he might make an
end of himself and that through sancho imprud he might miss hi
own object said to him as thou livest my friend let the matter
rest where it is for the remedi seem to me a veri rough on and it
will be well to have patienc zamora wa not won in an hour if i
have not reckon wrong thou hast given thyself over a thousand lash

throw your cloak over my shoulder for im sweat and i dont want
to take cold it a risk that novic disciplin run
don quixot obei and strip himself cover sancho who slept
until the sun woke him thei then resum their journei which for the
time be thei brought to an end at a villag that lai three leagu
farther on thei dismount at a hostelri which don quixot recognis
as such and did not take to be a castl with moat turret portculli
and drawbridg for ever sinc he had been vanquish he talk more
ration about everyth as will be shown present thei quarter
him in a room on the ground floor where in place of leather hang
there were piec of paint serg such as thei commonli us in
villag on on of them wa paint by some veri poor hand the rape of
helen when the bold guest carri her off from menelau and on the
other wa the stori of dido and nea she on a high tower as though
she were make signal with a half sheet to her fugit guest who wa
out at sea fly in a frigat or brigantin he notic in the two
stori that helen did not go veri reluctantli for she wa laugh
slyli and roguishli but the fair dido wa shown drop tear the
size of walnut from her ey don quixot as he look at them
observ those two ladi were veri unfortun not to have been born
in thi ag and i unfortun abov all men not to have been born in
their had i fallen in with those gentlemen troi would not have been
burn or carthag destroi for it would have been onli for me to
slai pari and all these misfortun would have been avoid
ill lai a bet said sancho that befor long there wont be a
tavern roadsid inn hostelri or barber shop where the stori of our
do wont be paint up but id like it paint by the hand of a
better painter than paint these
thou art right sancho said don quixot for thi painter is like
orbaneja a painter there wa at beda who when thei ask him what he
wa paint us to sai whatev it mai turn out and if he chanc
to paint a cock he would write under it thi is a cock for fear
thei might think it wa a fox the painter or writer for it all the
same who publish the histori of thi new don quixot that ha come
out must have been on of thi sort i think sancho for he paint or
wrote whatev it might turn out or perhap he is like a poet call
mauleon that wa about the court some year ago who us to answer at
haphazard whatev he wa ask and on on ask him what deum de
deo meant he repli d dond dier but put thi asid tell
me sancho hast thou a mind to have anoth turn at thyself tonight
and wouldst thou rather have it indoor or in the open air
egad seor said sancho for what im go to give myself it
come all the same to me whether it is in a hous or in the field
still id like it to be among tree for i think thei ar compani for
me and help me to bear my pain wonderfulli
and yet it must not be sancho my friend said don quixot but to
enabl thee to recov strength we must keep it for our own villag
for at the latest we shall get there the dai after tomorrow
sancho said he might do as he pleas but that for hi own part he
would like to finish off the busi quickli befor hi blood cool
and while he had an appetit becaus in delai there is apt to be
danger veri often and prai to god and ply the hammer and
on take wa better than two ill give thee and a sparrow in the
hand than a vultur on the wing
for god sake sancho no more proverb exclaim don quixot it
seem to me thou art becom sicut erat again speak in a plain
simpl straightforward wai as i have often told thee and thou wilt
find the good of it
i dont know what bad luck it is of mine said sancho but i cant
utter a word without a proverb that is not as good as an argument to my
mind howev i mean to mend if i can and so for the present the
convers end

accomplish of hi wish meanwhil there arriv at the hostelri a
travel on horseback with three or four servant on of whom said to
him who appear to be the master here seor don lvaro tarf your
worship mai take your siesta todai the quarter seem clean and cool
when he heard thi don quixot said to sancho look here sancho on
turn over the leav of that book of the second part of my histori i
think i came casual upon thi name of don lvaro tarf
veri like said sancho we had better let him dismount and
byandbi we can ask about it
the gentleman dismount and the landladi gave him a room on the
ground floor opposit don quixot and adorn with paint serg
hang of the same sort the newli arriv gentleman put on a summer
coat and come out to the gatewai of the hostelri which wa wide and
cool address don quixot who wa pace up and down there he
ask in what direct is your worship bound gentl sir
to a villag near thi which is my own villag repli don quixot
and your worship where ar you bound for
i am go to granada seor said the gentleman to my own
countri
and a goodli countri said don quixot but will your worship do me
the favour of tell me your name for it strike me it is of more
import to me to know it than i can tell you
my name is don lvaro tarf repli the travel
to which don quixot return i have no doubt whatev that your
worship is that don lvaro tarf who appear in print in the second
part of the histori of don quixot of la mancha late print and
publish by a new author
i am the same repli the gentleman and that same don quixot the
princip personag in the said histori wa a veri great friend of
mine and it wa i who took him awai from home or at least induc him
to come to some joust that were to be held at saragossa whither i wa
go myself inde i show him mani kind and save him from
have hi shoulder touch up by the execution becaus of hi
extrem rash
tell me seor don lvaro said don quixot am i at all like that
don quixot you talk of
no inde repli the travel not a bit
and that don quixot said our on had he with him a squir call
sancho panza
he had said don lvaro but though he had the name of be veri
droll i never heard him sai anyth that had ani drolleri in it
that i can well believ said sancho at thi for to come out with
drolleri is not in everybodi line and that sancho your worship
speak of gentl sir must be some great scoundrel dunderhead and
thief all in on for i am the real sancho panza and i have more
drolleri than if it rain them let your worship onli try come
along with me for a year or so and you will find thei fall from me at
everi turn and so rich and so plenti that though mostli i dont
know what i am sai i make everybodi that hear me laugh and the
real don quixot of la mancha the famou the valiant the wise the
lover the righter of wrong the guardian of minor and orphan the
protector of widow the killer of damsel he who ha for hi sole
mistress the peerless dulcinea del toboso is thi gentleman befor
you my master all other don quixot and all other sancho panza ar
dream and mockeri
by god i believ it said don lvaro for you have utter more
drolleri my friend in the few word you have spoken than the other
sancho panza in all i ever heard from him and thei were not a few he
wa more greedi than wellspoken and more dull than droll and i am
convinc that the enchant who persecut don quixot the good have
been try to persecut me with don quixot the bad but i dont know
what to sai for i am readi to swear i left him shut up in the casa del
nuncio at toledo and here anoth don quixot turn up though a veri
differ on from mine
i dont know whether i am good said don quixot but i can safe
sai i am not the bad and to prove it let me tell you seor don
lvaro tarf i have never in my life been in saragossa so far from
that when it wa told me that thi imaginari don quixot had been
present at the joust in that citi i declin to enter it in order to
drag hi falsehood befor the face of the world and so i went on
straight to barcelona the treasurehous of courtesi haven of
stranger asylum of the poor home of the valiant champion of the
wrong pleasant exchang of firm friendship and citi unrival in
site and beauti and though the adventur that befel me there ar not
by ani mean matter of enjoy but rather of regret i do not
regret them simpli becaus i have seen it in a word seor don lvaro
tarf i am don quixot of la mancha the on that fame speak of and
not the unlucki on that ha attempt to usurp my name and deck
himself out in my idea i entreat your worship by your devoir as a
gentleman to be so good as to make a declar befor the alcald of
thi villag that you never in all your life saw me until now and that
neither am i the don quixot in print in the second part nor thi
sancho panza my squir the on your worship knew
that i will do most willingli repli don lvaro though it amaz
me to find two don quixot and two sancho panza at onc as much
alik in name as thei differ in demeanour and again i sai and declar
that what i saw i cannot have seen and that what happen me cannot
have happen
no doubt your worship is enchant like my ladi dulcinea del toboso
said sancho and would to heaven your disenchant rest on my
give myself anoth three thousand and odd lash like what im
give myself for her for id lai them on without look for
anyth
i dont understand that about the lash said don lvaro sancho
repli that it wa a long stori to tell but he would tell him if thei
happen to be go the same road
by thi dinnertim arriv and don quixot and don lvaro dine
togeth the alcald of the villag came by chanc into the inn
togeth with a notari and don quixot laid a petit befor him
show that it wa requisit for hi right that don lvaro tarf the
gentleman there present should make a declar befor him that he
did not know don quixot of la mancha also there present and that he
wa not the on that wa in print in a histori entitl second part of
don quixot of la mancha by on avellaneda of tordesilla the
alcald final put it in legal form and the declar wa made with
all the formal requir in such case at which don quixot and
sancho were in high delight as if a declar of the sort wa of ani
great import to them and as if their word and deed did not
plainli show the differ between the two don quixot and the two
sancho mani civil and offer of servic were exchang by don
lvaro and don quixot in the cours of which the great manchegan
displai such good tast that he disabus don lvaro of the error he

care that the lash would not have knock off a fly had there been

strang thing i bring monei and that the main thing got by my own
industri without wrong anybodi
you bring the monei my good husband said teresa and no matter
whether it wa got thi wai or that for howev you mai have got it
youll not have brought ani new practic into the world
sanchica embrac her father and ask him if he brought her anyth
for she had been look out for him as for the shower of mai and she
take hold of him by the girdl on on side and hi wife by the hand
while the daughter led dappl thei made for their hous leav don
quixot in hi in the hand of hi niec and housekeep and in the
compani of the curat and the bachelor
don quixot at onc without ani regard to time or season withdrew in
privat with the bachelor and the curat and in a few word told them
of hi defeat and of the engag he wa under not to quit hi
villag for a year which he meant to keep to the letter without
depart a hair breadth from it as becam a knighterr bound by
scrupul good faith and the law of knighterrantri and of how he
thought of turn shepherd for that year and take hi divers in
the solitud of the field where he could with perfect freedom give
rang to hi thought of love while he follow the virtuou pastor
call and he besought them if thei had not a great deal to do and
were not prevent by more import busi to consent to be hi
companion for he would bui sheep enough to qualifi them for
shepherd and the most import point of the whole affair he could
tell them wa settl for he had given them name that would fit them
to a t the curat ask what thei were don quixot repli that he
himself wa to be call the shepherd quixot and the bachelor the
shepherd carrascon and the curat the shepherd curambro and sancho
panza the shepherd pancino
both were astound at don quixot new craze howev lest he should
onc more make off out of the villag from them in pursuit of hi
chivalri thei trust that in the cours of the year he might be
cure fell in with hi new project applaud hi crazi idea as a
bright on and offer to share the life with him and what more
said samson carrasco i am as all the world know a veri famou
poet and ill be alwai make vers pastor or courtli or as it
mai come into my head to pass awai our time in those seclud region
where we shall be roam but what is most need sir is that each
of us should choos the name of the shepherdess he mean to glorifi in
hi vers and that we should not leav a tree be it ever so hard
without write up and carv her name on it as is the habit and
custom of lovesmitten shepherd
that the veri thing said don quixot though i am reliev from
look for the name of an imaginari shepherdess for there the
peerless dulcinea del toboso the glori of these brooksid the
ornament of these meadow the mainstai of beauti the cream of all the
grace and in a word the be to whom all prais is appropri be
it ever so hyperbol
veri true said the curat but we the other must look about for
accommod shepherdess that will answer our purpos on wai or
anoth
and ad samson carrasco if thei fail us we can call them by the
name of the on in print that the world is fill with flida
amarilis diana flerida galatea belisarda for as thei sell
them in the marketplac we mai fairli bui them and make them our own
if my ladi or i should sai my shepherdess happen to be call ana
ill sing her prais under the name of anarda and if francisca ill
call her francenia and if lucia lucinda for it all come to the same
thing and sancho panza if he join thi fratern mai glorifi hi
wife teresa panza as teresaina
don quixot laugh at the adapt of the name and the curat
bestow vast prais upon the worthi and honour resolut he had
made and again offer to bear him compani all the time that he could
spare from hi imper duti and so thei took their leav of him
recommend and beseech him to take care of hi health and treat
himself to a suitabl diet
it so happen hi niec and the housekeep overheard all the three of
them said and as soon as thei were gone thei both of them came in to
don quixot and said the niec what thi uncl now that we were
think you had come back to stai at home and lead a quiet respect
life there ar you go to get into fresh entangl and turn
young shepherd thou that comest here young shepherd go there
nai inde the straw is too hard now to make pipe of
and ad the housekeep will your worship be abl to bear out
in the field the heat of summer and the chill of winter and the
howl of the wolv not you for that a life and a busi for
hardi men bred and season to such work almost from the time thei
were in swaddlingcloth why to make choic of evil it better to
be a knighterr than a shepherd look here seor take my
adviceand im not give it to you full of bread and wine but
fast and with fifti year upon my headstai at home look after
your affair go often to confess be good to the poor and upon my
soul be it if ani evil come to you

forwheth it wa of the deject the thought of hi defeat produc
or of heaven will that so order ita fever settl upon him and
kept him in hi bed for six dai dure which he wa often visit by
hi friend the curat the bachelor and the barber while hi good
squir sancho panza never quit hi bedsid thei persuad that it
wa grief at find himself vanquish and the object of hi heart
the liber and disenchant of dulcinea unattain that kept
him in thi state strove by all the mean in their power to cheer him
up the bachelor bid him take heart and get up to begin hi
pastor life for which he himself he said had alreadi compos an
eclogu that would take the shine out of all sannazaro had ever
written and had bought with hi own monei two famou dog to guard the
flock on call barcino and the other butron which a herdsman of
quintanar had sold him
but for all thi don quixot could not shake off hi sad hi
friend call in the doctor who felt hi puls and wa not veri well
satisfi with it and said that in ani case it would be well for him
to attend to the health of hi soul as that of hi bodi wa in a bad
wai don quixot heard thi calmli but not so hi housekeep hi
niec and hi squir who fell weep bitterli as if thei had him
ly dead befor them the doctor opinion wa that melancholi and
depress were bring him to hi end don quixot beg them to
leav him to himself as he had a wish to sleep a littl thei obei
and he slept at on stretch as the sai is more than six hour so
that the housekeep and niec thought he wa go to sleep for ever
but at the end of that time he woke up and in a loud voic exclaim
bless be almighti god who ha shown me such good in truth hi
merci ar boundless and the sin of men can neither limit them nor
keep them back
the niec listen with attent to her uncl word and thei struck
her as more coher than what usual fell from him at least dure
hi ill so she ask what ar you sai seor ha anyth
strang occur what merci or what sin of men ar you talk of
the merci niec said don quixot ar those that god ha thi

them my reason is now free and clear rid of the dark shadow of
ignor that my unhappi constant studi of those detest book of
chivalri cast over it now i see through their absurd and
decept and it onli griev me that thi destruct of my
illus ha come so late that it leav me no time to make some
amend by read other book that might be a light to my soul niec
i feel myself at the point of death and i would fain meet it in such a
wai as to show that my life ha not been so ill that i should leav
behind me the name of a madman for though i have been on i would not
that the fact should be made plainer at my death call in to me my
dear my good friend the curat the bachelor samson carrasco and
master nichola the barber for i wish to confess and make my will
but hi niec wa save the troubl by the entranc of the three the
instant don quixot saw them he exclaim good new for you good
sir that i am no longer don quixot of la mancha but alonso quixano
whose wai of life won for him the name of good now am i the enemi of
amadi of gaul and of the whole countless troop of hi descend
odiou to me now ar all the profan stori of knighterrantri now i
perceiv my folli and the peril into which read them brought me
now by god merci school into my right sens i loath them
when the three heard him speak in thi wai thei had no doubt whatev
that some new craze had taken possess of him and said samson
what seor don quixot now that we have intellig of the ladi
dulcinea be disench ar you take thi line now just as we
ar on the point of becom shepherd to pass our live sing like
princ ar you think of turn hermit hush for heaven sake
be ration and let have no more nonsens
all that nonsens said don quixot that until now ha been a
realiti to my hurt my death will with heaven help turn to my good
i feel sir that i am rapidli draw near death a truce to jest
let me have a confessor to confess me and a notari to make my will
for in extrem like thi man must not trifl with hi soul and
while the curat is confess me let someon i beg go for the
notari
thei look at on anoth wonder at don quixot word but
though uncertain thei were inclin to believ him and on of the
sign by which thei came to the conclus he wa dy wa thi so
sudden and complet return to hi sens after have been mad for to
the word alreadi quot he ad much more so well express so
devout and so ration as to banish all doubt and convinc them that
he wa sound of mind the curat turn them all out and left alon
with him confess him the bachelor went for the notari and return
shortli afterward with him and with sancho who have alreadi
learn from the bachelor the condit hi master wa in and find
the housekeep and niec weep began to blubber and shed tear
the confess over the curat came out sai alonso quixano the
good is inde dy and is inde in hi right mind we mai now go in
to him while he make hi will
thi new gave a tremend impuls to the brim ey of the
housekeep niec and sancho panza hi good squir make the tear
burst from their ey and a host of sigh from their heart for of a
truth as ha been said more than onc whether as plain alonso quixano
the good or as don quixot of la mancha don quixot wa alwai of a
gentl disposit and kindli in all hi wai and henc he wa
belov not onli by those of hi own hous but by all who knew him
the notari came in with the rest and as soon as the preambl of the
will had been set out and don quixot had commend hi soul to god
with all the devout formal that ar usual come to the bequest
he said item it is my will that touch certain monei in the
hand of sancho panza whom in my mad i made my squir inasmuch
as between him and me there have been certain account and debit and
credit no claim be made against him nor ani account demand of him
in respect of them but that if anyth remain over and abov after
he ha paid himself what i ow him the balanc which will be but
littl shall be hi and much good mai it do him and if as when i
wa mad i had a share in give him the govern of an island so
now that i am in my sens i could give him that of a kingdom it
should be hi for the simplic of hi charact and the fidel of
hi conduct deserv it and then turn to sancho he said forgiv
me my friend that i led thee to seem as mad as myself make thee
fall into the same error i myself fell into that there were and still
ar knightserr in the world
ah said sancho weep dont die master but take my advic and
live mani year for the foolishest thing a man can do in thi life is
to let himself die without rhyme or reason without anybodi kill
him or ani hand but melancholi make an end of him come dont be
lazi but get up from your bed and let us take to the field in
shepherd trim as we agre perhap behind some bush we shall find
the ladi dulcinea disench as fine as fine can be if it be that
you ar dy of vexat at have been vanquish lai the blame on
me and sai you were overthrown becaus i had girth rocinant badli
besid you must have seen in your book of chivalri that it is a
common thing for knight to upset on anoth and for him who is
conquer todai to be conqueror tomorrow
veri true said samson and good sancho panza view of these case
is quit right
sir not so fast said don quixot in last year nest there ar
no bird thi year i wa mad now i am in my sens i wa don
quixot of la mancha i am now as i said alonso quixano the good and
mai my repent and sincer restor me to the esteem you us to
have for me and now let master notari proce

here present after all ha been deduct from the most avail
portion of it that mai be requir to satisfi the bequest i have made
and the first disburs i desir to be made is the payment of the
wage i ow for the time my housekeep ha serv me with twenti
ducat over and abov for a gown the curat and the bachelor samson
carrasco now present i appoint my executor
item it is my wish that if antonia quixana my niec desir to
marri she shall marri a man of whom it shall be first of all
ascertain by inform taken that he doe not know what book of
chivalri ar and if it should be prove that he doe and if in spite
of thi my niec insist upon marri him and doe marri him then
that she shall forfeit the whole of what i have left her which my
executor shall devot to work of chariti as thei pleas
item i entreat the aforesaid gentlemen my executor that if ani
happi chanc should lead them to discov the author who is said to
have written a histori now go about under the titl of second part
of the achiev of don quixot of la mancha thei beg of him on my
behalf as earnestli as thei can to forgiv me for have been without

knighterr dy in hi bed so calmli and so like a christian as don
quixot who amid the tear and lament of all present yield up
hi spirit that is to sai di on perceiv it the curat beg the
