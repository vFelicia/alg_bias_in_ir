the time travel for so it will be conveni to speak of him wa
expound a recondit matter to us hi pale grei ey shone and
twinkl and hi usual pale face wa flush and anim the fire
burnt brightli and the soft radianc of the incandesc light in the
lili of silver caught the bubbl that flash and pass in our
glass our chair be hi patent embrac and caress us rather
than submit to be sat upon and there wa that luxuri
afterdinn atmospher when thought run gracefulli free of the
trammel of precis and he put it to us in thi waymark the
point with a lean forefingera we sat and lazili admir hi
earnest over thi new paradox as we thought it and hi fecund
you must follow me carefulli i shall have to controvert on or two
idea that ar almost univers accept the geometri for instanc
thei taught you at school is found on a misconcept
is not that rather a larg thing to expect us to begin upon said
filbi an argument person with red hair
i do not mean to ask you to accept anyth without reason ground
for it you will soon admit as much as i need from you you know of
cours that a mathemat line a line of thick nil ha no real
exist thei taught you that neither ha a mathemat plane
these thing ar mere abstract
that is all right said the psychologist
nor have onli length breadth and thick can a cube have a
real exist
there i object said filbi of cours a solid bodi mai exist all
real thing
so most peopl think but wait a moment can an instantan cube
exist
dont follow you said filbi
can a cube that doe not last for ani time at all have a real
exist
filbi becam pensiv clearli the time travel proceed ani
real bodi must have extens in four direct it must have
length breadth thick anddur but through a natur
infirm of the flesh which i will explain to you in a moment we
inclin to overlook thi fact there ar realli four dimens three
which we call the three plane of space and a fourth time there is
howev a tendenc to draw an unreal distinct between the former
three dimens and the latter becaus it happen that our
conscious move intermitt in on direct along the latter
from the begin to the end of our live
that said a veri young man make spasmod effort to relight hi
cigar over the lamp that veri clear inde
now it is veri remark that thi is so extens overlook
continu the time travel with a slight access of cheer
realli thi is what is meant by the fourth dimens though some
peopl who talk about the fourth dimens do not know thei mean it it
is onli anoth wai of look at time there is no differ between
time and ani of the three dimens of space except that our
conscious move along it but some foolish peopl have got hold of
the wrong side of that idea you have all heard what thei have to sai
about thi fourth dimens
i have not said the provinci mayor
it is simpli thi that space as our mathematician have it is
spoken of as have three dimens which on mai call length
breadth and thick and is alwai defin by refer to three
plane each at right angl to the other but some philosoph
peopl have been ask why three dimens particularlywhi not
anoth direct at right angl to the other threeand have even
tri to construct a fourdimension geometri professor simon newcomb
wa expound thi to the new york mathemat societi onli a month
or so ago you know how on a flat surfac which ha onli two
dimens we can repres a figur of a threedimension solid and
similarli thei think that by model of three dimens thei could
repres on of fourif thei could master the perspect of the
thing see
i think so murmur the provinci mayor and knit hi brow
he laps into an introspect state hi lip move as on who
repeat mystic word ye i think i see it now he said after some
time brighten in a quit transitori manner
well i do not mind tell you i have been at work upon thi geometri
of four dimens for some time some of my result ar curiou for
instanc here is a portrait of a man at eight year old anoth at
fifteen anoth at seventeen anoth at twentythre and so on all
these ar evid section as it were threedimension
represent of hi fourdimens be which is a fix and
unalter thing
scientif peopl proceed the time travel after the paus
requir for the proper assimil of thi know veri well that time
is onli a kind of space here is a popular scientif diagram a
weather record thi line i trace with my finger show the movement of
the baromet yesterdai it wa so high yesterdai night it fell then
thi morn it rose again and so gentli upward to here sure the
mercuri did not trace thi line in ani of the dimens of space
gener recognis but certainli it trace such a line and that
line therefor we must conclud wa along the timedimens
but said the medic man stare hard at a coal in the fire if
time is realli onli a fourth dimens of space why is it and why ha
it alwai been regard as someth differ and why cannot we move
in time as we move about in the other dimens of space
the time travel smile ar you so sure we can move freeli in
space right and left we can go backward and forward freeli enough
and men alwai have done so i admit we move freeli in two dimens
but how about up and down gravit limit us there
not exactli said the medic man there ar balloon
but befor the balloon save for spasmod jump and the
inequ of the surfac man had no freedom of vertic movement
still thei could move a littl up and down said the medic man
easier far easier down than up
and you cannot move at all in time you cannot get awai from the
present moment
my dear sir that is just where you ar wrong that is just where the
whole world ha gone wrong we ar alwai get awai from the present
moment our mental exist which ar immateri and have no
dimens ar pass along the timedimens with a uniform
veloc from the cradl to the grave just as we should travel down
if we began our exist fifti mile abov the earth surfac
but the great difficulti is thi interrupt the psychologist you
can move about in all direct of space but you cannot move about
in time
that is the germ of my great discoveri but you ar wrong to sai that
we cannot move about in time for instanc if i am recal an
incid veri vividli i go back to the instant of it occurr i
becom absentmind as you sai i jump back for a moment of cours
we have no mean of stai back for ani length of time ani more than
a savag or an anim ha of stai six feet abov the ground but a
civilis man is better off than the savag in thi respect he can go
up against gravit in a balloon and why should he not hope that
ultim he mai be abl to stop or acceler hi drift along the
timedimens or even turn about and travel the other wai
oh thi began filbi is all
why not said the time travel
it against reason said filbi
what reason said the time travel
you can show black is white by argument said filbi but you will
never convinc me
possibl not said the time travel but now you begin to see the
object of my investig into the geometri of four dimens long
ago i had a vagu inkl of a machin
to travel through time exclaim the veri young man
that shall travel indiffer in ani direct of space and time as
the driver determin
filbi content himself with laughter
but i have experiment verif said the time travel
it would be remark conveni for the historian the psychologist
suggest on might travel back and verifi the accept account of
the battl of hast for instanc
dont you think you would attract attent said the medic man
our ancestor had no great toler for anachron
on might get on greek from the veri lip of homer and plato the
veri young man thought
in which case thei would certainli plough you for the littlego the
german scholar have improv greek so much
then there is the futur said the veri young man just think on
might invest all on monei leav it to accumul at interest and
hurri on ahead
to discov a societi said i erect on a strictli communist
basi
of all the wild extravag theori began the psychologist
ye so it seem to me and so i never talk of it until
experiment verif cri i you ar go to verifi that
the experi cri filbi who wa get brainweari
let see your experi anyhow said the psychologist though it
all humbug you know
the time travel smile round at us then still smile faintli and
with hi hand deep in hi trouser pocket he walk slowli out of
the room and we heard hi slipper shuffl down the long passag to
hi laboratori
the psychologist look at us i wonder what he got
some sleightofhand trick or other said the medic man and filbi
tri to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at burslem but befor he
had finish hi prefac the time travel came back and filbi
anecdot collaps
ii
the machin
the thing the time travel held in hi hand wa a glitter metal
framework scarc larger than a small clock and veri delic
made there wa ivori in it and some transpar crystallin
substanc and now i must be explicit for thi that followsunless hi
explan is to be acceptedi an absolut unaccount thing he
took on of the small octagon tabl that were scatter about the
room and set it in front of the fire with two leg on the hearthrug
on thi tabl he place the mechan then he drew up a chair and sat
down the onli other object on the tabl wa a small shade lamp the
bright light of which fell upon the model there were also perhap a
dozen candl about two in brass candlestick upon the mantel and
sever in sconc so that the room wa brilliantli illumin i sat
in a low armchair nearest the fire and i drew thi forward so as to
be almost between the time travel and the fireplac filbi sat
behind him look over hi shoulder the medic man and the
provinci mayor watch him in profil from the right the
psychologist from the left the veri young man stood behind the
psychologist we were all on the alert it appear incred to me
that ani kind of trick howev subtli conceiv and howev adroitli
done could have been plai upon us under these condit
the time travel look at us and then at the mechan well
said the psychologist
thi littl affair said the time travel rest hi elbow upon
the tabl and press hi hand togeth abov the apparatu is onli
a model it is my plan for a machin to travel through time you will
notic that it look singularli askew and that there is an odd
twinkl appear about thi bar as though it wa in some wai
unreal he point to the part with hi finger also here is on
littl white lever and here is anoth
the medic man got up out of hi chair and peer into the thing
it beautifulli made he said
it took two year to make retort the time travel then when we
had all imit the action of the medic man he said now i want
you clearli to understand that thi lever be press over send
the machin glide into the futur and thi other revers the
motion thi saddl repres the seat of a time travel present
i am go to press the lever and off the machin will go it will
vanish pass into futur time and disappear have a good look at the
thing look at the tabl too and satisfi yourselv there is no
trickeri i dont want to wast thi model and then be told im a
quack
there wa a minut paus perhap the psychologist seem about to
speak to me but chang hi mind then the time travel put forth
hi finger toward the lever no he said suddenli lend me your
hand and turn to the psychologist he took that individu hand
in hi own and told him to put out hi forefing so that it wa the
psychologist himself who sent forth the model time machin on it
intermin voyag we all saw the lever turn i am absolut certain
there wa no trickeri there wa a breath of wind and the lamp flame
jump on of the candl on the mantel wa blown out and the littl
machin suddenli swung round becam indistinct wa seen as a ghost
for a second perhap as an eddi of faintli glitter brass and ivori
and it wa gonevanish save for the lamp the tabl wa bare
everyon wa silent for a minut then filbi said he wa damn
the psychologist recov from hi stupor and suddenli look under
the tabl at that the time travel laugh cheerfulli well he
said with a reminisc of the psychologist then get up he
went to the tobacco jar on the mantel and with hi back to us began to
fill hi pipe
we stare at each other look here said the medic man ar you in
earnest about thi do you serious believ that that machin ha
travel into time
certainli said the time travel stoop to light a spill at the
fire then he turn light hi pipe to look at the psychologist
face the psychologist to show that he wa not unhing help
himself to a cigar and tri to light it uncut what is more i have
a big machin nearli finish in thereh indic the
laboratoryand when that is put togeth i mean to have a journei on
my own account
you mean to sai that that machin ha travel into the futur said
filbi
into the futur or the pasti dont for certain know which
after an interv the psychologist had an inspir it must have
gone into the past if it ha gone anywher he said
why said the time travel
becaus i presum that it ha not move in space and if it travel
into the futur it would still be here all thi time sinc it must
have travel through thi time
but said i if it travel into the past it would have been
visibl when we came first into thi room and last thursdai when we
were here and the thursdai befor that and so forth
seriou object remark the provinci mayor with an air of
imparti turn toward the time travel
not a bit said the time travel and to the psychologist you
think you can explain that it present below the threshold
you know dilut present
of cours said the psychologist and reassur us that a simpl
point of psycholog i should have thought of it it plain enough
and help the paradox delightfulli we cannot see it nor can we
appreci thi machin ani more than we can the spoke of a wheel
spin or a bullet fly through the air if it is travel
through time fifti time or a hundr time faster than we ar if it
get through a minut while we get through a second the impress it
creat will of cours be onli onefiftieth or onehundredth of what it
would make if it were not travel in time that plain enough he
pass hi hand through the space in which the machin had been you
see he said laugh
we sat and stare at the vacant tabl for a minut or so then the time
travel ask us what we thought of it all
it sound plausibl enough tonight said the medic man but wait
until tomorrow wait for the common sens of the morn
would you like to see the time machin itself ask the time
travel and therewith take the lamp in hi hand he led the wai
down the long draughti corridor to hi laboratori i rememb vividli
the flicker light hi queer broad head in silhouett the danc of
the shadow how we all follow him puzzl but incredul and how
there in the laboratori we beheld a larger edit of the littl
mechan which we had seen vanish from befor our ey part were of
nickel part of ivori part had certainli been file or sawn out of
rock crystal the thing wa gener complet but the twist
crystallin bar lai unfinish upon the bench besid some sheet of
draw and i took on up for a better look at it quartz it seem
to be
look here said the medic man ar you perfectli seriou or is
thi a tricklik that ghost you show us last christma
upon that machin said the time travel hold the lamp aloft
i intend to explor time is that plain i wa never more seriou in
my life
none of us quit knew how to take it
i caught filbi ey over the shoulder of the medic man and he
wink at me solemnli
iii
the time travel return
i think that at that time none of us quit believ in the time
machin the fact is the time travel wa on of those men who ar
too clever to be believ you never felt that you saw all round him
you alwai suspect some subtl reserv some ingenu in ambush
behind hi lucid frank had filbi shown the model and explain the
matter in the time travel word we should have shown him far
less sceptic for we should have perceiv hi motiv a
porkbutch could understand filbi but the time travel had more
than a touch of whim among hi element and we distrust him thing
that would have made the fame of a less clever man seem trick in hi
hand it is a mistak to do thing too easili the seriou peopl who
took him serious never felt quit sure of hi deport thei were
somehow awar that trust their reput for judgment with him wa
like furnish a nurseri with eggshel china so i dont think ani of
us said veri much about time travel in the interv between that
thursdai and the next though it odd potenti ran no doubt in
most of our mind it plausibl that is it practic
incred the curiou possibl of anachron and of utter
confus it suggest for my own part i wa particularli preoccupi
with the trick of the model that i rememb discuss with the
medic man whom i met on fridai at the linnan he said he had seen a
similar thing at tbingen and laid consider stress on the
blowingout of the candl but how the trick wa done he could not
explain
the next thursdai i went again to richmondi suppos i wa on of the
time travel most constant guestsand arriv late found four or
five men alreadi assembl in hi drawingroom the medic man wa
stand befor the fire with a sheet of paper in on hand and hi
watch in the other i look round for the time travel andit
halfpast seven now said the medic man i suppos wed better have
dinner
where said i name our host
youv just come it rather odd he unavoid detain he ask
me in thi note to lead off with dinner at seven if he not back sai
hell explain when he come
it seem a piti to let the dinner spoil said the editor of a
wellknown daili paper and thereupon the doctor rang the bell
the psychologist wa the onli person besid the doctor and myself who
had attend the previou dinner the other men were blank the editor
aforement a certain journalist and anothera quiet shy man with
a beardwhom i didnt know and who as far as my observ went
never open hi mouth all the even there wa some specul at
the dinnert about the time travel absenc and i suggest
time travel in a halfjocular spirit the editor want that
explain to him and the psychologist volunt a wooden account of
the ingeni paradox and trick we had wit that dai week he
wa in the midst of hi exposit when the door from the corridor
open slowli and without nois i wa face the door and saw it
first hallo i said at last and the door open wider and the
time travel stood befor us i gave a cry of surpris good
heaven man what the matter cri the medic man who saw him
next and the whole tabl turn toward the door
he wa in an amaz plight hi coat wa dusti and dirti and smear
with green down the sleev hi hair disord and as it seem to
me greyereith with dust and dirt or becaus it colour had actual
fade hi face wa ghastli pale hi chin had a brown cut on ita cut
halfheal hi express wa haggard and drawn as by intens
suffer for a moment he hesit in the doorwai as if he had been
dazzl by the light then he came into the room he walk with just
such a limp as i have seen in footsor tramp we stare at him in
silenc expect him to speak
he said not a word but came painfulli to the tabl and made a motion
toward the wine the editor fill a glass of champagn and push it
toward him he drain it and it seem to do him good for he look
round the tabl and the ghost of hi old smile flicker across hi
face what on earth have you been up to man said the doctor the
time travel did not seem to hear dont let me disturb you he
said with a certain falter articul im all right he
stop held out hi glass for more and took it off at a draught
that good he said hi ey grew brighter and a faint colour came
into hi cheek hi glanc flicker over our face with a certain
dull approv and then went round the warm and comfort room then
he spoke again still as it were feel hi wai among hi word im
go to wash and dress and then ill come down and explain thing
save me some of that mutton im starv for a bit of meat
he look across at the editor who wa a rare visitor and hope he
wa all right the editor began a question tell you present said
the time travel imfunni be all right in a minut
he put down hi glass and walk toward the staircas door again i
remark hi lame and the soft pad sound of hi footfal and
stand up in my place i saw hi feet as he went out he had noth
on them but a pair of tatter bloodstain sock then the door
close upon him i had half a mind to follow till i rememb how he
detest ani fuss about himself for a minut perhap my mind wa
woolgath then remark behaviour of an emin scientist i
heard the editor sai think after hi wont in headlin and thi
brought my attent back to the bright dinnert
what the game said the journalist ha he been do the amateur
cadger i dont follow i met the ey of the psychologist and read my
own interpret in hi face i thought of the time travel limp
painfulli upstair i dont think anyon els had notic hi lame
the first to recov complet from thi surpris wa the medic man
who rang the bellth time travel hate to have servant wait at
dinnerfor a hot plate at that the editor turn to hi knife and fork
with a grunt and the silent man follow suit the dinner wa resum
convers wa exclamatori for a littl while with gap of
wonder and then the editor got fervent in hi curios doe our
friend ek out hi modest incom with a cross or ha he hi
nebuchadnezzar phase he inquir i feel assur it thi busi
of the time machin i said and took up the psychologist account of
our previou meet the new guest were frankli incredul the
editor rais object what wa thi time travel a man
couldnt cover himself with dust by roll in a paradox could he
and then as the idea came home to him he resort to caricatur
hadnt thei ani clothesbrush in the futur the journalist too
would not believ at ani price and join the editor in the easi work
of heap ridicul on the whole thing thei were both the new kind of
journalistveri joyou irrever young men our special
correspond in the dai after tomorrow report the journalist wa
sayingor rather shoutingwhen the time travel came back he wa
dress in ordinari even cloth and noth save hi haggard look
remain of the chang that had startl me
i sai said the editor hilari these chap here sai you have
been travel into the middl of next week tell us all about littl
roseberi will you what will you take for the lot
the time travel came to the place reserv for him without a word
he smile quietli in hi old wai where my mutton he said what
a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again
stori cri the editor
stori be damn said the time travel i want someth to eat i
wont sai a word until i get some pepton into my arteri thank and
the salt
on word said i have you been time travel
ye said the time travel with hi mouth full nod hi head
id give a shill a line for a verbatim note said the editor the
time travel push hi glass toward the silent man and rang it with
hi fingernail at which the silent man who had been stare at hi
face start convuls and pour him wine the rest of the dinner
wa uncomfort for my own part sudden question kept on rise to
my lip and i dare sai it wa the same with the other the journalist
tri to reliev the tension by tell anecdot of hetti potter the
time travel devot hi attent to hi dinner and displai the
appetit of a tramp the medic man smoke a cigarett and watch
the time travel through hi eyelash the silent man seem even
more clumsi than usual and drank champagn with regular and
determin out of sheer nervous at last the time travel
push hi plate awai and look round us i suppos i must
apologis he said i wa simpli starv iv had a most amaz
time he reach out hi hand for a cigar and cut the end but come
into the smokingroom it too long a stori to tell over greasi
plate and ring the bell in pass he led the wai into the
adjoin room
you have told blank and dash and chose about the machin he said
to me lean back in hi easychair and name the three new guest
but the thing a mere paradox said the editor
i cant argu tonight i dont mind tell you the stori but i cant
argu i will he went on tell you the stori of what ha happen to
me if you like but you must refrain from interrupt i want to
tell it badli most of it will sound like ly so be it it
trueeveri word of it all the same i wa in my laboratori at four
oclock and sinc then iv live eight dai such dai as no human
be ever live befor im nearli worn out but i shant sleep till
iv told thi thing over to you then i shall go to bed but no
interrupt is it agre
agre said the editor and the rest of us echo agre and with
that the time travel began hi stori as i have set it forth he sat
back in hi chair at first and spoke like a weari man afterward he
got more anim in write it down i feel with onli too much
keen the inadequaci of pen and inkand abov all my own
inadequacyto express it qualiti you read i will suppos
attent enough but you cannot see the speaker white sincer
face in the bright circl of the littl lamp nor hear the inton
of hi voic you cannot know how hi express follow the turn of
hi stori most of us hearer were in shadow for the candl in the
smokingroom had not been light and onli the face of the journalist
and the leg of the silent man from the knee downward were
illumin at first we glanc now and again at each other after a
time we ceas to do that and look onli at the time travel
face
iv
time travel
i told some of you last thursdai of the principl of the time
machin and show you the actual thing itself incomplet in the
workshop there it is now a littl travelworn truli and on of the
ivori bar is crack and a brass rail bent but the rest of it
sound enough i expect to finish it on fridai but on fridai when
the put togeth wa nearli done i found that on of the nickel
bar wa exactli on inch too short and thi i had to get remad so
that the thing wa not complet until thi morn it wa at ten
oclock todai that the first of all time machin began it career i
gave it a last tap tri all the screw again put on more drop of
oil on the quartz rod and sat myself in the saddl i suppos a
suicid who hold a pistol to hi skull feel much the same wonder at
what will come next as i felt then i took the start lever in on
hand and the stop on in the other press the first and almost
immedi the second i seem to reel i felt a nightmar sensat
of fall and look round i saw the laboratori exactli as befor
had anyth happen for a moment i suspect that my intellect had
trick me then i note the clock a moment befor as it seem it
had stood at a minut or so past ten now it wa nearli halfpast
three
i drew a breath set my teeth grip the start lever with both
hand and went off with a thud the laboratori got hazi and went dark
mr watchett came in and walk appar without see me toward
the garden door i suppos it took her a minut or so to travers the
place but to me she seem to shoot across the room like a rocket i
press the lever over to it extrem posit the night came like the
turn out of a lamp and in anoth moment came tomorrow the
laboratori grew faint and hazi then fainter and ever fainter tomorrow
night came black then dai again night again dai again faster and
faster still an eddi murmur fill my ear and a strang dumb
confused descend on my mind
i am afraid i cannot convei the peculiar sensat of time
travel thei ar excess unpleas there is a feel exactli
like that on ha upon a switchbackof a helpless headlong motion i
felt the same horribl anticip too of an immin smash as i
put on pace night follow dai like the flap of a black wing the
dim suggest of the laboratori seem present to fall awai from me
and i saw the sun hop swiftli across the sky leap it everi
minut and everi minut mark a dai i suppos the laboratori had
been destroi and i had come into the open air i had a dim impress
of scaffold but i wa alreadi go too fast to be consciou of ani
move thing the slowest snail that ever crawl dash by too fast
for me the twinkl success of dark and light wa excess
pain to the ey then in the intermitt dark i saw the
moon spin swiftli through her quarter from new to full and had a
faint glimps of the circl star present as i went on still
gain veloc the palpit of night and dai merg into on
continu grey the sky took on a wonder deep of blue a
splendid lumin colour like that of earli twilight the jerk sun
becam a streak of fire a brilliant arch in space the moon a fainter
fluctuat band and i could see noth of the star save now and
then a brighter circl flicker in the blue
the landscap wa misti and vagu i wa still on the hillsid upon
which thi hous now stand and the shoulder rose abov me grei and
dim i saw tree grow and chang like puff of vapour now brown
now green thei grew spread shiver and pass awai i saw huge
build rise up faint and fair and pass like dream the whole
surfac of the earth seem changedmelt and flow under my ey
the littl hand upon the dial that regist my speed race round
faster and faster present i note that the sun belt swai up and
down from solstic to solstic in a minut or less and that
consequ my pace wa over a year a minut and minut by minut the
white snow flash across the world and vanish and wa follow by
the bright brief green of spring
the unpleas sensat of the start were less poignant now thei
merg at last into a kind of hyster exhilar i remark
inde a clumsi swai of the machin for which i wa unabl to
account but my mind wa too confus to attend to it so with a kind
of mad grow upon me i flung myself into futur at first i
scarc thought of stop scarc thought of anyth but these new
sensat but present a fresh seri of impress grew up in my
minda certain curios and therewith a certain dreaduntil at last
thei took complet possess of me what strang develop of
human what wonder advanc upon our rudimentari civilis i
thought might not appear when i came to look nearli into the dim
elus world that race and fluctuat befor my ey i saw great and
splendid architectur rise about me more massiv than ani build
of our own time and yet as it seem built of glimmer and mist i
saw a richer green flow up the hillsid and remain there without ani
wintri intermiss even through the veil of my confus the earth
seem veri fair and so my mind came round to the busi of
stop
the peculiar risk lai in the possibl of my find some substanc
in the space which i or the machin occupi so long as i travel
at a high veloc through time thi scarc matter i wa so to
speak attenuatedwa slip like a vapour through the interstic of
interven substanc but to come to a stop involv the jam of
myself molecul by molecul into whatev lai in my wai meant
bring my atom into such intim contact with those of the obstacl
that a profound chemic reactionposs a farreach
explosionwould result and blow myself and my apparatu out of all
possibl dimensionsinto the unknown thi possibl had occur to
me again and again while i wa make the machin but then i had
cheerfulli accept it as an unavoid riskon of the risk a man
ha got to take now the risk wa inevit i no longer saw it in the
same cheer light the fact is that insens the absolut
strang of everyth the sickli jar and swai of the
machin abov all the feel of prolong fall had absolut
upset my nerv i told myself that i could never stop and with a gust
of petul i resolv to stop forthwith like an impati fool i
lug over the lever and incontin the thing went reel over
and i wa flung headlong through the air
there wa the sound of a clap of thunder in my ear i mai have been
stun for a moment a pitiless hail wa hiss round me and i wa
sit on soft turf in front of the overset machin everyth still
seem grei but present i remark that the confus in my ear wa
gone i look round me i wa on what seem to be a littl lawn in a
garden surround by rhododendron bush and i notic that their
mauv and purpl blossom were drop in a shower under the beat
of the hailston the rebound danc hail hung in a littl cloud
over the machin and drove along the ground like smoke in a moment i
wa wet to the skin fine hospit said i to a man who ha
travel innumer year to see you
present i thought what a fool i wa to get wet i stood up and
look round me a coloss figur carv appar in some white
stone loom indistinctli beyond the rhododendron through the hazi
downpour but all els of the world wa invis
my sensat would be hard to describ as the column of hail grew
thinner i saw the white figur more distinctli it wa veri larg for
a silver birchtre touch it shoulder it wa of white marbl in
shape someth like a wing sphinx but the wing instead of be
carri vertic at the side were spread so that it seem to
hover the pedest it appear to me wa of bronz and wa thick
with verdigri it chanc that the face wa toward me the sightless
ey seem to watch me there wa the faint shadow of a smile on the
lip it wa greatli weatherworn and that impart an unpleas
suggest of diseas i stood look at it for a littl spacehalf a
minut perhap or half an hour it seem to advanc and to reced as
the hail drove befor it denser or thinner at last i tore my ey from
it for a moment and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbar and
that the sky wa lighten with the promis of the sun
i look up again at the crouch white shape and the full temer
of my voyag came suddenli upon me what might appear when that hazi
curtain wa altogeth withdrawn what might not have happen to men
what if cruelti had grown into a common passion what if in thi
interv the race had lost it manli and had develop into
someth inhuman unsympathet and overwhelmingli power i might
seem some oldworld savag anim onli the more dread and
disgust for our common likenessa foul creatur to be incontin
slain
alreadi i saw other vast shapeshug build with intric parapet
and tall column with a wood hillsid dimli creep in upon me
through the lessen storm i wa seiz with a panic fear i turn
frantic to the time machin and strove hard to readjust it as i
did so the shaft of the sun smote through the thunderstorm the grei
downpour wa swept asid and vanish like the trail garment of a
ghost abov me in the intens blue of the summer sky some faint
brown shred of cloud whirl into nothing the great build
about me stood out clear and distinct shine with the wet of the
thunderstorm and pick out in white by the unmelt hailston pile
along their cours i felt nake in a strang world i felt as perhap
a bird mai feel in the clear air know the hawk wing abov and will
swoop my fear grew to frenzi i took a breath space set my teeth
and again grappl fierc wrist and knee with the machin it gave
under my desper onset and turn over it struck my chin violent
on hand on the saddl the other on the lever i stood pant heavili
in attitud to mount again
but with thi recoveri of a prompt retreat my courag recov i
look more curious and less fearfulli at thi world of the remot
futur in a circular open high up in the wall of the nearer hous
i saw a group of figur clad in rich soft robe thei had seen me and
their face were direct toward me
then i heard voic approach me come through the bush by the
white sphinx were the head and shoulder of men run on of these
emerg in a pathwai lead straight to the littl lawn upon which i
stood with my machin he wa a slight creatureperhap four feet
highclad in a purpl tunic girdl at the waist with a leather belt
sandal or buskinsi could not clearli distinguish whichwer on hi
feet hi leg were bare to the knee and hi head wa bare notic
that i notic for the first time how warm the air wa
he struck me as be a veri beauti and grace creatur but
indescrib frail hi flush face remind me of the more beauti
kind of consumptivethat hectic beauti of which we us to hear so
much at the sight of him i suddenli regain confid i took my
hand from the machin
v
in the golden ag
in anoth moment we were stand face to face i and thi fragil
thing out of futur he came straight up to me and laugh into my
ey the absenc from hi bear of ani sign of fear struck me at
onc then he turn to the two other who were follow him and spoke
to them in a strang and veri sweet and liquid tongu
there were other come and present a littl group of perhap
eight or ten of these exquisit creatur were about me on of them
address me it came into my head oddli enough that my voic wa too
harsh and deep for them so i shook my head and point to my ear
shook it again he came a step forward hesit and then touch my
hand then i felt other soft littl tentacl upon my back and
shoulder thei want to make sure i wa real there wa noth in
thi at all alarm inde there wa someth in these pretti
littl peopl that inspir confidencea grace gentl a certain
childlik eas and besid thei look so frail that i could fanci
myself fling the whole dozen of them about like ninepin but i made
a sudden motion to warn them when i saw their littl pink hand feel
at the time machin happili then when it wa not too late i thought
of a danger i had hitherto forgotten and reach over the bar of the
machin i unscrew the littl lever that would set it in motion and
put these in my pocket then i turn again to see what i could do in
the wai of commun
and then look more nearli into their featur i saw some further
peculiar in their dresden china type of pretti their hair
which wa uniformli curli came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek
there wa not the faintest suggest of it on the face and their ear
were singularli minut the mouth were small with bright red rather
thin lip and the littl chin ran to a point the ey were larg and
mild andthi mai seem egot on my parti fanci even that there
wa a certain lack of the interest i might have expect in them
as thei made no effort to commun with me but simpli stood round
me smile and speak in soft coo note to each other i began the
convers i point to the time machin and to myself then
hesit for a moment how to express time i point to the sun at
onc a quaintli pretti littl figur in chequer purpl and white
follow my gestur and then astonish me by imit the sound of
thunder
for a moment i wa stagger though the import of hi gestur wa
plain enough the question had come into my mind abruptli were these
creatur fool you mai hardli understand how it took me you see i
had alwai anticip that the peopl of the year eight hundr and
two thousand odd would be incred in front of us in knowledg art
everyth then on of them suddenli ask me a question that show
him to be on the intellectu level of on of our fiveyearold
childrenask me in fact if i had come from the sun in a
thunderstorm it let loos the judgment i had suspend upon their
cloth their frail light limb and fragil featur a flow of
disappoint rush across my mind for a moment i felt that i had
built the time machin in vain
i nod point to the sun and gave them such a vivid render of
a thunderclap as startl them thei all withdrew a pace or so and
bow then came on laugh toward me carri a chain of beauti
flower altogeth new to me and put it about my neck the idea wa
receiv with melodi applaus and present thei were all run
to and fro for flower and laughingli fling them upon me until i
wa almost smother with blossom you who have never seen the like can
scarc imagin what delic and wonder flower countless year of
cultur had creat then someon suggest that their playth should
be exhibit in the nearest build and so i wa led past the sphinx
of white marbl which had seem to watch me all the while with a
smile at my astonish toward a vast grei edific of fret stone
as i went with them the memori of my confid anticip of a
profoundli grave and intellectu poster came with irresist
merriment to my mind
the build had a huge entri and wa altogeth of coloss
dimens i wa natur most occupi with the grow crowd of
littl peopl and with the big open portal that yawn befor me
shadowi and mysteri my gener impress of the world i saw over
their head wa a tangl wast of beauti bush and flower a long
neglect and yet weedless garden i saw a number of tall spike of
strang white flower measur a foot perhap across the spread of
the waxen petal thei grew scatter as if wild among the varieg
shrub but as i sai i did not examin them close at thi time the
time machin wa left desert on the turf among the rhododendron
the arch of the doorwai wa richli carv but natur i did not
observ the carv veri narrowli though i fanci i saw suggest
of old phnician decor as i pass through and it struck me that
thei were veri badli broken and weatherworn sever more brightli
clad peopl met me in the doorwai and so we enter i dress in
dingi nineteenthcenturi garment look grotesqu enough garland
with flower and surround by an eddi mass of bright
softcolour robe and shine white limb in a melodi whirl of
laughter and laugh speech
the big doorwai open into a proportion great hall hung with
brown the roof wa in shadow and the window partial glaze with
colour glass and partial unglaz admit a temper light the
floor wa made up of huge block of some veri hard white metal not
plate nor slabsblock and it wa so much worn as i judg by the
go to and fro of past gener as to be deepli channel along
the more frequent wai transvers to the length were innumer
tabl made of slab of polish stone rais perhap a foot from
the floor and upon these were heap of fruit some i recognis as a
kind of hypertrophi raspberri and orang but for the most part thei
were strang
between the tabl wa scatter a great number of cushion upon
these my conductor seat themselv sign for me to do likewis
with a pretti absenc of ceremoni thei began to eat the fruit with
their hand fling peel and stalk and so forth into the round
open in the side of the tabl i wa not loath to follow their
exampl for i felt thirsti and hungri as i did so i survei the hall
at my leisur
and perhap the thing that struck me most wa it dilapid look
the stainedglass window which displai onli a geometr pattern
were broken in mani place and the curtain that hung across the lower
end were thick with dust and it caught my ey that the corner of the
marbl tabl near me wa fractur nevertheless the gener effect
wa extrem rich and picturesqu there were perhap a coupl of
hundr peopl dine in the hall and most of them seat as near to
me as thei could come were watch me with interest their littl
ey shine over the fruit thei were eat all were clad in the same
soft and yet strong silki materi
fruit by the bye wa all their diet these peopl of the remot
futur were strict vegetarian and while i wa with them in spite of
some carnal crave i had to be frugivor also inde i found
afterward that hors cattl sheep dog had follow the
ichthyosauru into extinct but the fruit were veri delight
on in particular that seem to be in season all the time i wa
therea flouri thing in a threesid huskwa especi good and i
made it my stapl at first i wa puzzl by all these strang fruit
and by the strang flower i saw but later i began to perceiv their
import
howev i am tell you of my fruit dinner in the distant futur
now so soon as my appetit wa a littl check i determin to make
a resolut attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine
clearli that wa the next thing to do the fruit seem a conveni
thing to begin upon and hold on of these up i began a seri of
interrog sound and gestur i had some consider difficulti
in convei my mean at first my effort met with a stare of
surpris or inextinguish laughter but present a fairhair
littl creatur seem to grasp my intent and repeat a name thei
had to chatter and explain the busi at great length to each other
and my first attempt to make the exquisit littl sound of their
languag caus an immens amount of genuin if uncivil amus
howev i felt like a schoolmast amidst children and persist and
present i had a score of noun substant at least at my command
and then i got to demonstr pronoun and even the verb to eat
but it wa slow work and the littl peopl soon tire and want to
get awai from my interrog so i determin rather of necess
to let them give their lesson in littl dose when thei felt inclin
and veri littl dose i found thei were befor long for i never met
peopl more indol or more easili fatigu
vi
the sunset of mankind
a queer thing i soon discov about my littl host and that wa
their lack of interest thei would come to me with eager cri of
astonish like children but like children thei would soon stop
examin me and wander awai after some other toi the dinner and my
convers begin end i note for the first time that almost
all those who had surround me at first were gone it is odd too how
speedili i came to disregard these littl peopl i went out through
the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger wa
satisfi i wa continu meet more of these men of the futur
who would follow me a littl distanc chatter and laugh about me and
have smile and gesticul in a friendli wai leav me again to my
own devic
the calm of even wa upon the world as i emerg from the great
hall and the scene wa lit by the warm glow of the set sun at
first thing were veri confus everyth wa so entir differ
from the world i had knowneven the flower the big build i had
left wa situat on the slope of a broad river vallei but the thame
had shift perhap a mile from it present posit i resolv to
mount to the summit of a crest perhap a mile and a half awai from
which i could get a wider view of thi our planet in the year eight
hundr and two thousand seven hundr and on ad for that i should
explain wa the date the littl dial of my machin record
as i walk i wa watch for everi impress that could possibl
help to explain the condit of ruinou splendour in which i found the
worldfor ruinou it wa a littl wai up the hill for instanc wa a
great heap of granit bound togeth by mass of aluminium a vast
labyrinth of precipit wall and crumpl heap amidst which were
thick heap of veri beauti pagodalik plantsnettl possiblybut
wonderfulli tint with brown about the leav and incap of
sting it wa evid the derelict remain of some vast structur
to what end built i could not determin it wa here that i wa
destin at a later date to have a veri strang experienceth first
intim of a still stranger discoverybut of that i will speak in
it proper place
look round with a sudden thought from a terrac on which i rest
for a while i realis that there were no small hous to be seen
appar the singl hous and possibl even the household had
vanish here and there among the greeneri were palacelik build
but the hous and the cottag which form such characterist featur
of our own english landscap had disappear
commun said i to myself
and on the heel of that came anoth thought i look at the
halfdozen littl figur that were follow me then in a flash i
perceiv that all had the same form of costum the same soft hairless
visag and the same girlish rotund of limb it mai seem strang
perhap that i had not notic thi befor but everyth wa so
strang now i saw the fact plainli enough in costum and in all the
differ of textur and bear that now mark off the sex from
each other these peopl of the futur were alik and the children
seem to my ey to be but the miniatur of their parent i judg
then that the children of that time were extrem precoci
physic at least and i found afterward abund verif of my
opinion
see the eas and secur in which these peopl were live i felt
that thi close resembl of the sex wa after all what on would
expect for the strength of a man and the soft of a woman the
institut of the famili and the differenti of occup ar
mere milit necess of an ag of physic forc where popul
is balanc and abund much childbear becom an evil rather than
a bless to the state where violenc come but rare and offspr
ar secur there is less necessityinde there is no necessityfor an
effici famili and the specialis of the sex with refer to
their children need disappear we see some begin of thi even
in our own time and in thi futur ag it wa complet thi i must
remind you wa my specul at the time later i wa to appreci
how far it fell short of the realiti
while i wa muse upon these thing my attent wa attract by a
pretti littl structur like a well under a cupola i thought in a
transitori wai of the odd of well still exist and then resum
the thread of my specul there were no larg build toward
the top of the hill and as my walk power were evid
miracul i wa present left alon for the first time with a
strang sens of freedom and adventur i push on up to the crest
there i found a seat of some yellow metal that i did not recognis
corrod in place with a kind of pinkish rust and half smother in
soft moss the armrest cast and file into the resembl of
griffin head i sat down on it and i survei the broad view of our
old world under the sunset of that long dai it wa as sweet and fair a
view as i have ever seen the sun had alreadi gone below the horizon
and the west wa flame gold touch with some horizont bar of
purpl and crimson below wa the vallei of the thame in which the
river lai like a band of burnish steel i have alreadi spoken of the
great palac dot about among the varieg greeneri some in ruin
and some still occupi here and there rose a white or silveri figur
in the wast garden of the earth here and there came the sharp
vertic line of some cupola or obelisk there were no hedg no sign
of proprietari right no evid of agricultur the whole earth had
becom a garden
so watch i began to put my interpret upon the thing i had
seen and as it shape itself to me that even my interpret wa
someth in thi wai afterward i found i had got onli a half
truthor onli a glimps of on facet of the truth
it seem to me that i had happen upon human upon the wane the
ruddi sunset set me think of the sunset of mankind for the first
time i began to realis an odd consequ of the social effort in
which we ar at present engag and yet come to think it is a
logic consequ enough strength is the outcom of need secur
set a premium on feebl the work of amelior the condit
of lifeth true civilis process that make life more and more
securehad gone steadili on to a climax on triumph of a unit
human over natur had follow anoth thing that ar now mere
dream had becom project deliber put in hand and carri
forward and the harvest wa what i saw
after all the sanit and the agricultur of todai ar still in
the rudimentari stage the scienc of our time ha attack but a
littl depart of the field of human diseas but even so it
spread it oper veri steadili and persist our agricultur
and horticultur destroi a weed just here and there and cultiv
perhap a score or so of wholesom plant leav the greater number
to fight out a balanc as thei can we improv our favourit plant and
animalsand how few thei aregradu by select breed now a new
and better peach now a seedless grape now a sweeter and larger
flower now a more conveni breed of cattl we improv them
gradual becaus our ideal ar vagu and tent and our
knowledg is veri limit becaus natur too is shy and slow in our
clumsi hand some dai all thi will be better organis and still
better that is the drift of the current in spite of the eddi the
whole world will be intellig educ and cooper thing
will move faster and faster toward the subjug of natur in the
end wise and carefulli we shall readjust the balanc of anim and
veget life to suit our human need
thi adjust i sai must have been done and done well done
inde for all time in the space of time across which my machin had
leapt the air wa free from gnat the earth from weed or fungi
everywher were fruit and sweet and delight flower brilliant
butterfli flew hither and thither the ideal of prevent medicin
wa attain diseas had been stamp out i saw no evid of ani
contagi diseas dure all my stai and i shall have to tell you
later that even the process of putrefact and decai had been
profoundli affect by these chang
social triumph too had been effect i saw mankind hous in
splendid shelter glorious cloth and as yet i had found them
engag in no toil there were no sign of struggl neither social nor
econom struggl the shop the advertis traffic all that
commerc which constitut the bodi of our world wa gone it wa
natur on that golden even that i should jump at the idea of a
social paradis the difficulti of increas popul had been met
i guess and popul had ceas to increas
but with thi chang in condit come inevit adapt to the
chang what unless biolog scienc is a mass of error is the
caus of human intellig and vigour hardship and freedom
condit under which the activ strong and subtl surviv and the
weaker go to the wall condit that put a premium upon the loyal
allianc of capabl men upon selfrestraint patienc and decis
and the institut of the famili and the emot that aris therein
the fierc jealousi the tender for offspr parent
selfdevot all found their justif and support in the
immin danger of the young now where ar these immin danger
there is a sentiment aris and it will grow against connubi
jealousi against fierc matern against passion of all sort
unnecessari thing now and thing that make us uncomfort savag
surviv discord in a refin and pleasant life
i thought of the physic slight of the peopl their lack of
intellig and those big abund ruin and it strengthen my
belief in a perfect conquest of natur for after the battl come
quiet human had been strong energet and intellig and had
us all it abund vital to alter the condit under which it
live and now came the reaction of the alter condit
under the new condit of perfect comfort and secur that
restless energi that with us is strength would becom weak even
in our own time certain tendenc and desir onc necessari to
surviv ar a constant sourc of failur physic courag and the
love of battl for instanc ar no great helpmai even be
hindrancesto a civilis man and in a state of physic balanc and
secur power intellectu as well as physic would be out of
place for countless year i judg there had been no danger of war or
solitari violenc no danger from wild beast no wast diseas to
requir strength of constitut no need of toil for such a life
what we should call the weak ar as well equip as the strong ar
inde no longer weak better equip inde thei ar for the strong
would be fret by an energi for which there wa no outlet no doubt
the exquisit beauti of the build i saw wa the outcom of the last
surg of the now purposeless energi of mankind befor it settl
down into perfect harmoni with the condit under which it livedth
flourish of that triumph which began the last great peac thi ha
ever been the fate of energi in secur it take to art and to
erotic and then come languor and decai
even thi artist impetu would at last die awayhad almost di in
the time i saw to adorn themselv with flower to danc to sing in
the sunlight so much wa left of the artist spirit and no more
even that would fade in the end into a content inact we ar
kept keen on the grindston of pain and necess and it seem to me
that here wa that hate grindston broken at last
as i stood there in the gather dark i thought that in thi simpl
explan i had master the problem of the worldmast the whole
secret of these delici peopl possibl the check thei had devis
for the increas of popul had succeed too well and their
number had rather diminish than kept stationari that would account
for the abandon ruin veri simpl wa my explan and plausibl

a sudden shock
as i stood there muse over thi too perfect triumph of man the full
moon yellow and gibbou came up out of an overflow of silver light in
the northeast the bright littl figur ceas to move about below a
noiseless owl flit by and i shiver with the chill of the night i
determin to descend and find where i could sleep
i look for the build i knew then my ey travel along to the
figur of the white sphinx upon the pedest of bronz grow
distinct as the light of the rise moon grew brighter i could see the
silver birch against it there wa the tangl of rhododendron bush
black in the pale light and there wa the littl lawn i look at the
lawn again a queer doubt chill my complac no said i stoutli
to myself that wa not the lawn
but it wa the lawn for the white leprou face of the sphinx wa
toward it can you imagin what i felt as thi convict came home to
me but you cannot the time machin wa gone
at onc like a lash across the face came the possibl of lose
my own ag of be left helpless in thi strang new world the bare
thought of it wa an actual physic sensat i could feel it grip me
at the throat and stop my breath in anoth moment i wa in a
passion of fear and run with great leap stride down the slope
onc i fell headlong and cut my face i lost no time in stanch the
blood but jump up and ran on with a warm trickl down my cheek and
chin all the time i ran i wa sai to myself thei have move it a
littl push it under the bush out of the wai nevertheless i ran
with all my might all the time with the certainti that sometim
come with excess dread i knew that such assur wa folli knew
instinct that the machin wa remov out of my reach my breath
came with pain i suppos i cover the whole distanc from the hill
crest to the littl lawn two mile perhap in ten minut and i am
not a young man i curs aloud as i ran at my confid folli in
leav the machin wast good breath therebi i cri aloud and
none answer not a creatur seem to be stir in that moonlit
world
when i reach the lawn my worst fear were realis not a trace of
the thing wa to be seen i felt faint and cold when i face the empti
space among the black tangl of bush i ran round it furious as if
the thing might be hidden in a corner and then stop abruptli with
my hand clutch my hair abov me tower the sphinx upon the
bronz pedest white shine leprou in the light of the rise
moon it seem to smile in mockeri of my dismai
i might have consol myself by imagin the littl peopl had put
the mechan in some shelter for me had i not felt assur of their
physic and intellectu inadequaci that is what dismai me the
sens of some hitherto unsuspect power through whose intervent my
invent had vanish yet for on thing i felt assur unless some
other ag had produc it exact duplic the machin could not have
move in time the attach of the leversi will show you the method
laterprev anyon from tamper with it in that wai when thei
were remov it had move and wa hid onli in space but then where
could it be
i think i must have had a kind of frenzi i rememb run violent
in and out among the moonlit bush all round the sphinx and startl
some white anim that in the dim light i took for a small deer i
rememb too late that night beat the bush with my clench
fist until my knuckl were gash and bleed from the broken twig
then sob and rave in my anguish of mind i went down to the
great build of stone the big hall wa dark silent and desert i
slip on the uneven floor and fell over on of the malachit tabl
almost break my shin i lit a match and went on past the dusti
curtain of which i have told you
there i found a second great hall cover with cushion upon which
perhap a score or so of the littl peopl were sleep i have no
doubt thei found my second appear strang enough come suddenli
out of the quiet dark with inarticul nois and the splutter and
flare of a match for thei had forgotten about match where is my
time machin i began bawl like an angri child lai hand upon
them and shake them up togeth it must have been veri queer to
them some laugh most of them look sore frighten when i saw
them stand round me it came into my head that i wa do as
foolish a thing as it wa possibl for me to do under the
circumst in try to reviv the sensat of fear for
reason from their daylight behaviour i thought that fear must be
forgotten
abruptli i dash down the match and knock on of the peopl over
in my cours went blunder across the big dininghal again out
under the moonlight i heard cri of terror and their littl feet
run and stumbl thi wai and that i do not rememb all i did as
the moon crept up the sky i suppos it wa the unexpect natur of my
loss that madden me i felt hopelessli cut off from my own kinda
strang anim in an unknown world i must have rave to and fro
scream and cry upon god and fate i have a memori of horribl
fatigu as the long night of despair wore awai of look in thi
imposs place and that of grope among moonlit ruin and touch
strang creatur in the black shadow at last of ly on the ground
near the sphinx and weep with absolut wretched even anger at
the folli of leav the machin have leak awai with my strength i
had noth left but miseri then i slept and when i woke again it wa
full dai and a coupl of sparrow were hop round me on the turf
within reach of my arm
i sat up in the fresh of the morn try to rememb how i had
got there and why i had such a profound sens of desert and
despair then thing came clear in my mind with the plain reason
daylight i could look my circumst fairli in the face i saw the
wild folli of my frenzi overnight and i could reason with myself
suppos the worst i said suppos the machin altogeth
lostperhap destroi it behov me to be calm and patient to learn
the wai of the peopl to get a clear idea of the method of my loss
and the mean of get materi and tool so that in the end
perhap i mai make anoth that would be my onli hope a poor hope
perhap but better than despair and after all it wa a beauti
and curiou world
but probabl the machin had onli been taken awai still i must be
calm and patient find it hidingplac and recov it by forc or
cun and with that i scrambl to my feet and look about me
wonder where i could bath i felt weari stiff and travelsoil
the fresh of the morn made me desir an equal fresh i had
exhaust my emot inde as i went about my busi i found
myself wonder at my intens excit overnight i made a care
examin of the ground about the littl lawn i wast some time in
futil question convei as well as i wa abl to such of the
littl peopl as came by thei all fail to understand my gestur
some were simpli stolid some thought it wa a jest and laugh at me
i had the hardest task in the world to keep my hand off their pretti
laugh face it wa a foolish impuls but the devil begotten of
fear and blind anger wa ill curb and still eager to take advantag
of my perplex the turf gave better counsel i found a groov rip
in it about midwai between the pedest of the sphinx and the mark of
my feet where on arriv i had struggl with the overturn machin
there were other sign of remov about with queer narrow footprint
like those i could imagin made by a sloth thi direct my closer
attent to the pedest it wa as i think i have said of bronz
it wa not a mere block but highli decor with deep frame panel
on either side i went and rap at these the pedest wa hollow
examin the panel with care i found them discontinu with the
frame there were no handl or keyhol but possibl the panel if
thei were door as i suppos open from within on thing wa clear
enough to my mind it took no veri great mental effort to infer that my
time machin wa insid that pedest but how it got there wa a
differ problem
i saw the head of two orangeclad peopl come through the bush
and under some blossomcov appletre toward me i turn smile
to them and beckon them to me thei came and then point to the
bronz pedest i tri to intim my wish to open it but at my
first gestur toward thi thei behav veri oddli i dont know how to
convei their express to you suppos you were to us a grossli
improp gestur to a delicatemind womanit is how she would look
thei went off as if thei had receiv the last possibl insult i tri
a sweetlook littl chap in white next with exactli the same
result somehow hi manner made me feel asham of myself but as you
know i want the time machin and i tri him onc more as he
turn off like the other my temper got the better of me in three
stride i wa after him had him by the loos part of hi robe round
the neck and began drag him toward the sphinx then i saw the
horror and repugn of hi face and all of a sudden i let him go
but i wa not beaten yet i bang with my fist at the bronz panel
i thought i heard someth stir insideto be explicit i thought i
heard a sound like a chucklebut i must have been mistaken then i got
a big pebbl from the river and came and hammer till i had flatten
a coil in the decor and the verdigri came off in powderi
flake the delic littl peopl must have heard me hammer in
gusti outbreak a mile awai on either hand but noth came of it i
saw a crowd of them upon the slope look furtiv at me at last
hot and tire i sat down to watch the place but i wa too restless to
watch long i am too occident for a long vigil i could work at a
problem for year but to wait inact for twentyfour hoursthat is
anoth matter
i got up after a time and began walk aimlessli through the bush
toward the hill again patienc said i to myself if you want your
machin again you must leav that sphinx alon if thei mean to take
your machin awai it littl good your wreck their bronz panel
and if thei dont you will get it back as soon as you can ask for it
to sit among all those unknown thing befor a puzzl like that is
hopeless that wai li monomania face thi world learn it wai
watch it be care of too hasti guess at it mean in the end
you will find clue to it all then suddenli the humour of the
situat came into my mind the thought of the year i had spent in
studi and toil to get into the futur ag and now my passion of
anxieti to get out of it i had made myself the most complic and
the most hopeless trap that ever a man devis although it wa at my
own expens i could not help myself i laugh aloud
go through the big palac it seem to me that the littl peopl
avoid me it mai have been my fanci or it mai have had someth to
do with my hammer at the gate of bronz yet i felt toler sure
of the avoid i wa care howev to show no concern and to
abstain from ani pursuit of them and in the cours of a dai or two
thing got back to the old foot i made what progress i could in the
languag and in addit i push my explor here and there
either i miss some subtl point or their languag wa excess
simplealmost exclus compos of concret substant and verb
there seem to be few if ani abstract term or littl us of
figur languag their sentenc were usual simpl and of two
word and i fail to convei or understand ani but the simplest
proposit i determin to put the thought of my time machin and
the mysteri of the bronz door under the sphinx as much as possibl
in a corner of memori until my grow knowledg would lead me back to
them in a natur wai yet a certain feel you mai understand
tether me in a circl of a few mile round the point of my arriv
viii
explan
so far as i could see all the world displai the same exuber
rich as the thame vallei from everi hill i climb i saw the same
abund of splendid build endlessli vari in materi and
style the same cluster thicket of evergreen the same
blossomladen tree and tree fern here and there water shone like
silver and beyond the land rose into blue undul hill and so
fade into the seren of the sky a peculiar featur which present
attract my attent wa the presenc of certain circular well
sever as it seem to me of a veri great depth on lai by the path
up the hill which i had follow dure my first walk like the other
it wa rim with bronz curious wrought and protect by a littl
cupola from the rain sit by the side of these well and peer
down into the shaft dark i could see no gleam of water nor
could i start ani reflect with a light match but in all of them i
heard a certain sound a thudthudthud like the beat of some big
engin and i discov from the flare of my match that a steadi
current of air set down the shaft further i threw a scrap of paper
into the throat of on and instead of flutter slowli down it wa
at onc suck swiftli out of sight
after a time too i came to connect these well with tall tower
stand here and there upon the slope for abov them there wa often
just such a flicker in the air as on see on a hot dai abov a
sunscorch beach put thing togeth i reach a strong
suggest of an extens system of subterranean ventil whose
true import it wa difficult to imagin i wa at first inclin to
associ it with the sanitari apparatu of these peopl it wa an
obviou conclus but it wa absolut wrong
and here i must admit that i learnt veri littl of drain and bell
and mode of convey and the like conveni dure my time in
thi real futur in some of these vision of utopia and come time
which i have read there is a vast amount of detail about build and
social arrang and so forth but while such detail ar easi
enough to obtain when the whole world is contain in on
imagin thei ar altogeth inaccess to a real travel amid
such realiti as i found here conceiv the tale of london which a
negro fresh from central africa would take back to hi tribe what
would he know of railwai compani of social movement of telephon
and telegraph wire of the parcel deliveri compani and postal order
and the like yet we at least should be will enough to explain
these thing to him and even of what he knew how much could he make
hi untravel friend either apprehend or believ then think how
narrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own time and
how wide the interv between myself and these of the golden ag i wa
sensibl of much which wa unseen and which contribut to my comfort
but save for a gener impress of automat organis i fear i
can convei veri littl of the differ to your mind
in the matter of sepultur for instanc i could see no sign of
crematoria nor anyth suggest of tomb but it occur to me
that possibl there might be cemeteri or crematoria somewher
beyond the rang of my explor thi again wa a question i
deliber put to myself and my curios wa at first entir
defeat upon the point the thing puzzl me and i wa led to make a
further remark which puzzl me still more that ag and infirm among
thi peopl there were none
i must confess that my satisfact with my first theori of an
automat civilis and a decad human did not long endur yet
i could think of no other let me put my difficulti the sever big
palac i had explor were mere live place great dininghal and
sleep apart i could find no machineri no applianc of ani
kind yet these peopl were cloth in pleasant fabric that must at
time need renew and their sandal though undecor were fairli
complex specimen of metalwork somehow such thing must be made and
the littl peopl displai no vestig of a creativ tendenc there
were no shop no workshop no sign of import among them thei
spent all their time in plai gentli in bath in the river in
make love in a halfplay fashion in eat fruit and sleep i
could not see how thing were kept go
then again about the time machin someth i knew not what had
taken it into the hollow pedest of the white sphinx why for the
life of me i could not imagin those waterless well too those
flicker pillar i felt i lack a clue i felthow shall i put it
suppos you found an inscript with sentenc here and there in
excel plain english and interpol therewith other made up of
word of letter even absolut unknown to you well on the third
dai of my visit that wa how the world of eight hundr and two
thousand seven hundr and on present itself to me
that dai too i made a friendof a sort it happen that as i wa
watch some of the littl peopl bath in a shallow on of them
wa seiz with cramp and began drift downstream the main current
ran rather swiftli but not too strongli for even a moder swimmer
it will give you an idea therefor of the strang defici in these
creatur when i tell you that none made the slightest attempt to
rescu the weakli cry littl thing which wa drown befor their
ey when i realis thi i hurriedli slip off my cloth and
wade in at a point lower down i caught the poor mite and drew her
safe to land a littl rub of the limb soon brought her round and
i had the satisfact of see she wa all right befor i left her i
had got to such a low estim of her kind that i did not expect ani
gratitud from her in that howev i wa wrong
thi happen in the morn in the afternoon i met my littl woman
as i believ it wa as i wa return toward my centr from an
explor and she receiv me with cri of delight and present me
with a big garland of flowersevid made for me and me alon the
thing took my imagin veri possibl i had been feel desol
at ani rate i did my best to displai my appreci of the gift we
were soon seat togeth in a littl stone arbour engag in
convers chiefli of smile the creatur friendli affect
me exactli as a child might have done we pass each other flower
and she kiss my hand i did the same to her then i tri talk and
found that her name wa weena which though i dont know what it
meant somehow seem appropri enough that wa the begin of a
queer friendship which last a week and endeda i will tell you
she wa exactli like a child she want to be with me alwai she
tri to follow me everywher and on my next journei out and about it
went to my heart to tire her down and leav her at last exhaust and
call after me rather plaintiv but the problem of the world had
to be master i had not i said to myself come into the futur to
carri on a miniatur flirtat yet her distress when i left her wa
veri great her expostul at the part were sometim frantic
and i think altogeth i had as much troubl as comfort from her
devot nevertheless she wa somehow a veri great comfort i
thought it wa mere childish affect that made her cling to me until
it wa too late i did not clearli know what i had inflict upon her
when i left her nor until it wa too late did i clearli understand
what she wa to me for by mere seem fond of me and show in
her weak futil wai that she care for me the littl doll of a
creatur present gave my return to the neighbourhood of the white
sphinx almost the feel of come home and i would watch for her
tini figur of white and gold so soon as i came over the hill
it wa from her too that i learnt that fear had not yet left the
world she wa fearless enough in the daylight and she had the oddest
confid in me for onc in a foolish moment i made threaten
grimac at her and she simpli laugh at them but she dread the
dark dread shadow dread black thing dark to her wa the
on thing dread it wa a singularli passion emot and it set
me think and observ i discov then among other thing that
these littl peopl gather into the great hous after dark and
slept in drove to enter upon them without a light wa to put them
into a tumult of apprehens i never found on out of door or on
sleep alon within door after dark yet i wa still such a
blockhead that i miss the lesson of that fear and in spite of
weena distress i insist upon sleep awai from these slumber
multitud
it troubl her greatli but in the end her odd affect for me
triumph and for five of the night of our acquaint includ
the last night of all she slept with her head pillow on my arm but
my stori slip awai from me as i speak of her it must have been the
night befor her rescu that i wa awaken about dawn i had been
restless dream most disagre that i wa drown and that sea
anemon were feel over my face with their soft palp i woke with a
start and with an odd fanci that some greyish anim had just rush
out of the chamber i tri to get to sleep again but i felt restless
and uncomfort it wa that dim grei hour when thing ar just
creep out of dark when everyth is colourless and clear cut
and yet unreal i got up and went down into the great hall and so out
upon the flagston in front of the palac i thought i would make a
virtu of necess and see the sunris
the moon wa set and the dy moonlight and the first pallor of
dawn were mingl in a ghastli halflight the bush were inki black
the ground a sombr grei the sky colourless and cheerless and up the
hill i thought i could see ghost three sever time as i scan
the slope i saw white figur twice i fanci i saw a solitari white
apelik creatur run rather quickli up the hill and onc near the
ruin i saw a leash of them carri some dark bodi thei move
hastili i did not see what becam of them it seem that thei
vanish among the bush the dawn wa still indistinct you must
understand i wa feel that chill uncertain earlymorn feel
you mai have known i doubt my ey
as the eastern sky grew brighter and the light of the dai came on and
it vivid colour return upon the world onc more i scan the
view keenli but i saw no vestig of my white figur thei were mere
creatur of the halflight thei must have been ghost i said i
wonder whenc thei date for a queer notion of grant allen came
into my head and amus me if each gener die and leav ghost
he argu the world at last will get overcrowd with them on that
theori thei would have grown innumer some eight hundr thousand
year henc and it wa no great wonder to see four at onc but the
jest wa unsatisfi and i wa think of these figur all the
morn until weena rescu drove them out of my head i associ
them in some indefinit wai with the white anim i had startl in my
first passion search for the time machin but weena wa a pleasant
substitut yet all the same thei were soon destin to take far
deadlier possess of my mind
i think i have said how much hotter than our own wa the weather of
thi golden ag i cannot account for it it mai be that the sun wa
hotter or the earth nearer the sun it is usual to assum that the sun
will go on cool steadili in the futur but peopl unfamiliar with
such specul as those of the younger darwin forget that the
planet must ultim fall back on by on into the parent bodi as
these catastroph occur the sun will blaze with renew energi and
it mai be that some inner planet had suffer thi fate whatev the
reason the fact remain that the sun wa veri much hotter than we know
it
well on veri hot morningmi fourth i thinka i wa seek shelter
from the heat and glare in a coloss ruin near the great hous where i
slept and fed there happen thi strang thing clamber among
these heap of masonri i found a narrow galleri whose end and side
window were block by fallen mass of stone by contrast with the
brillianc outsid it seem at first impenetr dark to me i
enter it grope for the chang from light to black made spot
of colour swim befor me suddenli i halt spellbound a pair of ey
lumin by reflect against the daylight without wa watch me
out of the dark
the old instinct dread of wild beast came upon me i clench my
hand and steadfastli look into the glare eyebal i wa afraid to
turn then the thought of the absolut secur in which human
appear to be live came to my mind and then i rememb that
strang terror of the dark overcom my fear to some extent i
advanc a step and spoke i will admit that my voic wa harsh and
illcontrol i put out my hand and touch someth soft at onc
the ey dart sidewai and someth white ran past me i turn
with my heart in my mouth and saw a queer littl apelik figur it
head held down in a peculiar manner run across the sunlit space
behind me it blunder against a block of granit stagger asid
and in a moment wa hidden in a black shadow beneath anoth pile of
ruin masonri
my impress of it is of cours imperfect but i know it wa a dull
white and had strang larg greyishr ey also that there wa
flaxen hair on it head and down it back but as i sai it went too
fast for me to see distinctli i cannot even sai whether it ran on all
four or onli with it forearm held veri low after an instant
paus i follow it into the second heap of ruin i could not find it
at first but after a time in the profound obscur i came upon on
of those round welllik open of which i have told you half close
by a fallen pillar a sudden thought came to me could thi thing have
vanish down the shaft i lit a match and look down i saw a
small white move creatur with larg bright ey which regard me
steadfastli as it retreat it made me shudder it wa so like a human
spider it wa clamber down the wall and now i saw for the first
time a number of metal foot and hand rest form a kind of ladder
down the shaft then the light burn my finger and fell out of my
hand go out as it drop and when i had lit anoth the littl
monster had disappear
i do not know how long i sat peer down that well it wa not for
some time that i could succe in persuad myself that the thing i
had seen wa human but gradual the truth dawn on me that man
had not remain on speci but had differenti into two distinct
anim that my grace children of the upper world were not the sole
descend of our gener but that thi bleach obscen
nocturn thing which had flash befor me wa also heir to all the
ag
i thought of the flicker pillar and of my theori of an underground
ventil i began to suspect their true import and what i
wonder wa thi lemur do in my scheme of a perfectli balanc
organis how wa it relat to the indol seren of the
beauti overworld and what wa hidden down there at the foot of
that shaft i sat upon the edg of the well tell myself that at ani
rate there wa noth to fear and that there i must descend for the
solut of my difficulti and withal i wa absolut afraid to go
as i hesit two of the beauti upperworld peopl came run in
their amor sport across the daylight in the shadow the male pursu
the femal fling flower at her as he ran
thei seem distress to find me my arm against the overturn
pillar peer down the well appar it wa consid bad form to
remark these apertur for when i point to thi on and tri to
frame a question about it in their tongu thei were still more visibl
distress and turn awai but thei were interest by my match and
i struck some to amus them i tri them again about the well and
again i fail so present i left them mean to go back to weena
and see what i could get from her but my mind wa alreadi in
revolut my guess and impress were slip and slide to a
new adjust i had now a clue to the import of these well to the
ventil tower to the mysteri of the ghost to sai noth of a
hint at the mean of the bronz gate and the fate of the time
machin and veri vagu there came a suggest toward the solut
of the econom problem that had puzzl me
here wa the new view plainli thi second speci of man wa
subterranean there were three circumst in particular which made
me think that it rare emerg abov ground wa the outcom of a
longcontinu underground habit in the first place there wa the
bleach look common in most anim that live larg in the darkth
white fish of the kentucki cave for instanc then those larg ey
with that capac for reflect light ar common featur of
nocturn thingswit the owl and the cat and last of all that
evid confus in the sunshin that hasti yet fumbl awkward
flight toward dark shadow and that peculiar carriag of the head
while in the lightal reinforc the theori of an extrem
sensit of the retina
beneath my feet then the earth must be tunnel enorm and
these tunnel were the habitat of the new race the presenc of
ventil shaft and well along the hill slopeseverywher in fact
except along the river valleyshow how univers were it
ramif what so natur then as to assum that it wa in thi
artifici underworld that such work as wa necessari to the comfort of
the daylight race wa done the notion wa so plausibl that i at onc
accept it and went on to assum the how of thi split of the
human speci i dare sai you will anticip the shape of my theori
though for myself i veri soon felt that it fell far short of the
truth
at first proceed from the problem of our own ag it seem clear
as daylight to me that the gradual widen of the present mere
temporari and social differ between the capitalist and the labour
wa the kei to the whole posit no doubt it will seem grotesqu
enough to youand wildli incredibleand yet even now there ar
exist circumst to point that wai there is a tendenc to
utilis underground space for the less ornament purpos of
civilis there is the metropolitan railwai in london for
instanc there ar new electr railwai there ar subwai there ar
underground workroom and restaur and thei increas and multipli
evid i thought thi tendenc had increas till industri had
gradual lost it birthright in the sky i mean that it had gone
deeper and deeper into larger and ever larger underground factori
spend a stillincreas amount of it time therein till in the
end even now doe not an eastend worker live in such artifici
condit as practic to be cut off from the natur surfac of the
earth
again the exclus tendenc of richer peopledu no doubt to the
increas refin of their educ and the widen gulf between
them and the rude violenc of the poori alreadi lead to the
close in their interest of consider portion of the surfac of
the land about london for instanc perhap half the prettier countri
is shut in against intrus and thi same widen gulfwhich is due
to the length and expens of the higher educ process and the
increas facil for and temptat toward refin habit on the
part of the richwil make that exchang between class and class that
promot by intermarriag which at present retard the split of
our speci along line of social stratif less and less
frequent so in the end abov ground you must have the have
pursu pleasur and comfort and beauti and below ground the
havenot the worker get continu adapt to the condit of
their labour onc thei were there thei would no doubt have to pai
rent and not a littl of it for the ventil of their cavern and
if thei refus thei would starv or be suffoc for arrear such
of them as were so constitut as to be miser and rebelli would
die and in the end the balanc be perman the survivor would
becom as well adapt to the condit of underground life and as
happi in their wai as the overworld peopl were to their as it
seem to me the refin beauti and the etiol pallor follow
natur enough
the great triumph of human i had dream of took a differ shape
in my mind it had been no such triumph of moral educ and gener
cooper as i had imagin instead i saw a real aristocraci
arm with a perfect scienc and work to a logic conclus the
industri system of todai it triumph had not been simpli a triumph
over natur but a triumph over natur and the fellowman thi i must
warn you wa my theori at the time i had no conveni ciceron in
the pattern of the utopian book my explan mai be absolut
wrong i still think it is the most plausibl on but even on thi
supposit the balanc civilis that wa at last attain must
have long sinc pass it zenith and wa now far fallen into decai
the tooperfect secur of the overworld had led them to a slow
movement of degener to a gener dwindl in size strength and
intellig that i could see clearli enough alreadi what had
happen to the underground i did not yet suspect but from what i
had seen of the morlocksthat by the bye wa the name by which these
creatur were calledi could imagin that the modif of the
human type wa even far more profound than among the eloi the
beauti race that i alreadi knew
then came troublesom doubt why had the morlock taken my time
machin for i felt sure it wa thei who had taken it why too if the
eloi were master could thei not restor the machin to me and why
were thei so terribl afraid of the dark i proceed as i have said
to question weena about thi underworld but here again i wa
disappoint at first she would not understand my question and
present she refus to answer them she shiver as though the topic
wa unendur and when i press her perhap a littl harshli she
burst into tear thei were the onli tear except my own i ever saw
in that golden ag when i saw them i ceas abruptli to troubl about
the morlock and wa onli concern in banish these sign of her
human inherit from weena ey and veri soon she wa smile and
clap her hand while i solemnli burnt a match
ix
the morlock
it mai seem odd to you but it wa two dai befor i could follow up
the newfound clue in what wa manifestli the proper wai i felt a
peculiar shrink from those pallid bodi thei were just the
halfbleach colour of the worm and thing on see preserv in
spirit in a zoolog museum and thei were filthili cold to the
touch probabl my shrink wa larg due to the sympathet
influenc of the eloi whose disgust of the morlock i now began to
appreci
the next night i did not sleep well probabl my health wa a littl
disord i wa oppress with perplex and doubt onc or twice i
had a feel of intens fear for which i could perceiv no definit
reason i rememb creep noiselessli into the great hall where the
littl peopl were sleep in the moonlightthat night weena wa among
themand feel reassur by their presenc it occur to me even
then that in the cours of a few dai the moon must pass through it
last quarter and the night grow dark when the appear of these
unpleas creatur from below these whiten lemur thi new vermin
that had replac the old might be more abund and on both these
dai i had the restless feel of on who shirk an inevit duti i
felt assur that the time machin wa onli to be recov by boldli
penetr these mysteri of underground yet i could not face the
mysteri if onli i had had a companion it would have been differ
but i wa so horribl alon and even to clamber down into the dark
of the well appal me i dont know if you will understand my
feel but i never felt quit safe at my back
it wa thi restless thi insecur perhap that drove me
farther and farther afield in my explor expedit go to the
southwestward toward the rise countri that is now call comb
wood i observ faroff in the direct of nineteenthcenturi
banstead a vast green structur differ in charact from ani i had
hitherto seen it wa larger than the largest of the palac or ruin i
knew and the faad had an orient look the face of it have the
lustr as well as the palegreen tint a kind of bluishgreen of a
certain type of chines porcelain thi differ in aspect suggest
a differ in us and i wa mind to push on and explor but the
dai wa grow late and i had come upon the sight of the place after
a long and tire circuit so i resolv to hold over the adventur for
the follow dai and i return to the welcom and the caress of
littl weena but next morn i perceiv clearli enough that my
curios regard the palac of green porcelain wa a piec of
selfdecept to enabl me to shirk by anoth dai an experi i
dread i resolv i would make the descent without further wast of
time and start out in the earli morn toward a well near the
ruin of granit and aluminium
littl weena ran with me she danc besid me to the well but when
she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward she seem strang
disconcert goodby littl weena i said kiss her and then
put her down i began to feel over the parapet for the climb
hook rather hastili i mai as well confess for i fear my courag
might leak awai at first she watch me in amaz then she gave a
most piteou cry and run to me she began to pull at me with her
littl hand i think her opposit nerv me rather to proce i
shook her off perhap a littl roughli and in anoth moment i wa in
the throat of the well i saw her agonis face over the parapet and
smile to reassur her then i had to look down at the unstabl hook
to which i clung
i had to clamber down a shaft of perhap two hundr yard the
descent wa effect by mean of metal bar project from the
side of the well and these be adapt to the need of a creatur
much smaller and lighter than myself i wa speedili cramp and
fatigu by the descent and not simpli fatigu on of the bar bent
suddenli under my weight and almost swung me off into the black
beneath for a moment i hung by on hand and after that experi i
did not dare to rest again though my arm and back were present
acut pain i went on clamber down the sheer descent with as
quick a motion as possibl glanc upward i saw the apertur a
small blue disc in which a star wa visibl while littl weena head
show as a round black project the thud sound of a machin
below grew louder and more oppress everyth save that littl disc
abov wa profoundli dark and when i look up again weena had
disappear
i wa in an agoni of discomfort i had some thought of try to go up
the shaft again and leav the underworld alon but even while i
turn thi over in my mind i continu to descend at last with
intens relief i saw dimli come up a foot to the right of me a
slender loophol in the wall swing myself in i found it wa the
apertur of a narrow horizont tunnel in which i could lie down and
rest it wa not too soon my arm ach my back wa cramp and i
wa trembl with the prolong terror of a fall besid thi the
unbroken dark had had a distress effect upon my ey the air
wa full of the throb and hum of machineri pump air down the shaft
i do not know how long i lai i wa arrous by a soft hand touch
my face start up in the dark i snatch at my match and
hastili strike on i saw three stoop white creatur similar to
the on i had seen abov ground in the ruin hastili retreat befor
the light live as thei did in what appear to me impenetr
dark their ey were abnorm larg and sensit just as ar
the pupil of the abysm fish and thei reflect the light in the
same wai i have no doubt thei could see me in that rayless obscur
and thei did not seem to have ani fear of me apart from the light but
so soon as i struck a match in order to see them thei fled
incontin vanish into dark gutter and tunnel from which
their ey glare at me in the strangest fashion
i tri to call to them but the languag thei had wa appar
differ from that of the overworld peopl so that i wa need left
to my own unaid effort and the thought of flight befor explor
wa even then in my mind but i said to myself you ar in for it
now and feel my wai along the tunnel i found the nois of
machineri grow louder present the wall fell awai from me and i
came to a larg open space and strike anoth match saw that i had
enter a vast arch cavern which stretch into utter dark
beyond the rang of my light the view i had of it wa as much as on
could see in the burn of a match
necessarili my memori is vagu great shape like big machin rose
out of the dim and cast grotesqu black shadow in which dim
spectral morlock shelter from the glare the place by the bye wa
veri stuffi and oppress and the faint halitu of freshlysh blood
wa in the air some wai down the central vista wa a littl tabl of
white metal laid with what seem a meal the morlock at ani rate
were carnivor even at the time i rememb wonder what larg
anim could have surviv to furnish the red joint i saw it wa all
veri indistinct the heavi smell the big unmean shape the obscen
figur lurk in the shadow and onli wait for the dark to
come at me again then the match burnt down and stung my finger and
fell a wriggl red spot in the black
i have thought sinc how particularli illequip i wa for such an
experi when i had start with the time machin i had start
with the absurd assumpt that the men of the futur would certainli
be infinit ahead of ourselv in all their applianc i had come
without arm without medicin without anyth to smokeat time i
miss tobacco frightfullyeven without enough match if onli i had
thought of a kodak i could have flash that glimps of the underworld
in a second and examin it at leisur but as it wa i stood there
with onli the weapon and the power that natur had endow me
withhand feet and teeth these and four safetymatch that still
remain to me
i wa afraid to push my wai in among all thi machineri in the dark
and it wa onli with my last glimps of light i discov that my
store of match had run low it had never occur to me until that
moment that there wa ani need to economis them and i had wast
almost half the box in astonish the overworld to whom fire wa a
novelti now as i sai i had four left and while i stood in the dark
a hand touch mine lank finger came feel over my face and i wa
sensibl of a peculiar unpleas odour i fanci i heard the
breath of a crowd of those dread littl be about me i felt
the box of match in my hand be gentli disengag and other hand
behind me pluck at my cloth the sens of these unseen creatur
examin me wa indescrib unpleas the sudden realis of my
ignor of their wai of think and do came home to me veri
vividli in the dark i shout at them as loudli as i could thei
start awai and then i could feel them approach me again thei
clutch at me more boldli whisper odd sound to each other i
shiver violent and shout againrath discordantli thi time
thei were not so serious alarm and thei made a queer laugh
nois as thei came back at me i will confess i wa horribl
frighten i determin to strike anoth match and escap under the
protect of it glare i did so and ek out the flicker with a
scrap of paper from my pocket i made good my retreat to the narrow
tunnel but i had scarc enter thi when my light wa blown out and
in the black i could hear the morlock rustl like wind among
leav and patter like the rain as thei hurri after me
in a moment i wa clutch by sever hand and there wa no
mistak that thei were try to haul me back i struck anoth
light and wave it in their dazzl face you can scarc imagin how
nauseatingli inhuman thei lookedthos pale chinless face and great
lidless pinkishgrei eyesa thei stare in their blind and
bewilder but i did not stai to look i promis you i retreat
again and when my second match had end i struck my third it had
almost burnt through when i reach the open into the shaft i lai
down on the edg for the throb of the great pump below made me giddi
then i felt sidewai for the project hook and as i did so my
feet were grasp from behind and i wa violent tug backward i
lit my last match and it incontin went out but i had my hand on
the climb bar now and kick violent i disengag myself from
the clutch of the morlock and wa speedili clamber up the shaft
while thei stai peer and blink up at me all but on littl
wretch who follow me for some wai and wellnigh secur my boot as a
trophi
that climb seem intermin to me with the last twenti or thirti
feet of it a deadli nausea came upon me i had the greatest difficulti
in keep my hold the last few yard wa a fright struggl against
thi faint sever time my head swam and i felt all the
sensat of fall at last howev i got over the wellmouth
somehow and stagger out of the ruin into the blind sunlight i
fell upon my face even the soil smelt sweet and clean then i rememb
weena kiss my hand and ear and the voic of other among the
eloi then for a time i wa insens
x
when night came
now inde i seem in a wors case than befor hitherto except
dure my night anguish at the loss of the time machin i had felt a
sustain hope of ultim escap but that hope wa stagger by
these new discoveri hitherto i had mere thought myself imped by
the childish simplic of the littl peopl and by some unknown
forc which i had onli to understand to overcom but there wa an
altogeth new element in the sicken qualiti of the morlocksa
someth inhuman and malign instinct i loath them befor i
had felt as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit my concern wa
with the pit and how to get out of it now i felt like a beast in a
trap whose enemi would come upon him soon
the enemi i dread mai surpris you it wa the dark of the new
moon weena had put thi into my head by some at first incomprehens
remark about the dark night it wa not now such a veri difficult
problem to guess what the come dark night might mean the moon wa
on the wane each night there wa a longer interv of dark and i
now understood to some slight degre at least the reason of the fear of
the littl upperworld peopl for the dark i wonder vagu what foul
villaini it might be that the morlock did under the new moon i felt
pretti sure now that my second hypothesi wa all wrong the upperworld
peopl might onc have been the favour aristocraci and the morlock
their mechan servant but that had long sinc pass awai the two
speci that had result from the evolut of man were slide down
toward or had alreadi arriv at an altogeth new relationship the
eloi like the carlovignan king had decai to a mere beauti
futil thei still possess the earth on suffer sinc the
morlock subterranean for innumer gener had come at last to
find the daylit surfac intoler and the morlock made their
garment i infer and maintain them in their habitu need
perhap through the surviv of an old habit of servic thei did it as
a stand hors paw with hi foot or as a man enjoi kill anim
in sport becaus ancient and depart necess had impress it on
the organ but clearli the old order wa alreadi in part revers
the nemesi of the delic on wa creep on apac ag ago
thousand of gener ago man had thrust hi brother man out of the
eas and the sunshin and now that brother wa come backchang
alreadi the eloi had begun to learn on old lesson anew thei were
becom reacquaint with fear and suddenli there came into my head
the memori of the meat i had seen in the underworld it seem odd how
it float into my mind not stir up as it were by the current of my
medit but come in almost like a question from outsid i tri
to recal the form of it i had a vagu sens of someth familiar
but i could not tell what it wa at the time
still howev helpless the littl peopl in the presenc of their
mysteri fear i wa differ constitut i came out of thi ag
of our thi ripe prime of the human race when fear doe not paralys
and mysteri ha lost it terror i at least would defend myself
without further delai i determin to make myself arm and a fast
where i might sleep with that refug as a base i could face thi
strang world with some of that confid i had lost in realis to
what creatur night by night i lai expos i felt i could never sleep
again until my bed wa secur from them i shudder with horror to
think how thei must alreadi have examin me
i wander dure the afternoon along the vallei of the thame but
found noth that commend itself to my mind as inaccess all the
build and tree seem easili practic to such dexter
climber as the morlock to judg by their well must be then the
tall pinnacl of the palac of green porcelain and the polish gleam
of it wall came back to my memori and in the even take weena
like a child upon my shoulder i went up the hill toward the
southwest the distanc i had reckon wa seven or eight mile but
it must have been nearer eighteen i had first seen the place on a
moist afternoon when distanc ar decept diminish in addit
the heel of on of my shoe wa loos and a nail wa work through
the solethei were comfort old shoe i wore about indoorsso that i
wa lame and it wa alreadi long past sunset when i came in sight of
the palac silhouet black against the pale yellow of the sky
weena had been huge delight when i began to carri her but after a
while she desir me to let her down and ran along by the side of me
occasion dart off on either hand to pick flower to stick in my
pocket my pocket had alwai puzzl weena but at the last she had
conclud that thei were an eccentr kind of vase for floral
decor at least she utilis them for that purpos and that
remind me in chang my jacket i found
the time travel paus put hi hand into hi pocket and silent
place two wither flower not unlik veri larg white mallow upon
the littl tabl then he resum hi narr
as the hush of even crept over the world and we proceed over the
hill crest toward wimbledon weena grew tire and want to return to
the hous of grei stone but i point out the distant pinnacl of the
palac of green porcelain to her and contriv to make her understand
that we were seek a refug there from her fear you know that great
paus that come upon thing befor the dusk even the breez stop in
the tree to me there is alwai an air of expect about that
even still the sky wa clear remot and empti save for a few
horizont bar far down in the sunset well that night the
expect took the colour of my fear in that darkl calm my
sens seem preternatur sharpen i fanci i could even feel
the hollow of the ground beneath my feet could inde almost see
through it the morlock on their anthil go hither and thither and
wait for the dark in my excit i fanci that thei would
receiv my invas of their burrow as a declar of war and why
had thei taken my time machin
so we went on in the quiet and the twilight deepen into night the
clear blue of the distanc fade and on star after anoth came out
the ground grew dim and the tree black weena fear and her fatigu
grew upon her i took her in my arm and talk to her and caress
her then as the dark grew deeper she put her arm round my neck
and close her ey tightli press her face against my shoulder so
we went down a long slope into a vallei and there in the dim i
almost walk into a littl river thi i wade and went up the
opposit side of the vallei past a number of sleep hous and by a
statuea faun or some such figur minu the head here too were
acacia so far i had seen noth of the morlock but it wa yet
earli in the night and the darker hour befor the old moon rose were
still to come
from the brow of the next hill i saw a thick wood spread wide and
black befor me i hesit at thi i could see no end to it either
to the right or the left feel tiredmi feet in particular were
veri sorei carefulli lower weena from my shoulder as i halt and
sat down upon the turf i could no longer see the palac of green
porcelain and i wa in doubt of my direct i look into the
thick of the wood and thought of what it might hide under that
dens tangl of branch on would be out of sight of the star even
were there no other lurk dangera danger i did not care to let my
imagin loos uponther would still be all the root to stumbl
over and the treebol to strike against i wa veri tire too after
the excit of the dai so i decid that i would not face it but
would pass the night upon the open hill
weena i wa glad to find wa fast asleep i carefulli wrap her in
my jacket and sat down besid her to wait for the moonris the
hillsid wa quiet and desert but from the black of the wood there
came now and then a stir of live thing abov me shone the star
for the night wa veri clear i felt a certain sens of friendli
comfort in their twinkl all the old constel had gone from
the sky howev that slow movement which is impercept in a
hundr human lifetim had long sinc rearrang them in unfamiliar
group but the milki wai it seem to me wa still the same
tatter streamer of stardust as of yore southward as i judg it
wa a veri bright red star that wa new to me it wa even more
splendid than our own green siriu and amid all these scintil
point of light on bright planet shone kindli and steadili like the
face of an old friend
look at these star suddenli dwarf my own troubl and all the
graviti of terrestri life i thought of their unfathom
distanc and the slow inevit drift of their movement out of the
unknown past into the unknown futur i thought of the great
precession cycl that the pole of the earth describ onli forti
time had that silent revolut occur dure all the year that i
had travers and dure these few revolut all the activ all
the tradit the complex organis the nation languag
literatur aspir even the mere memori of man as i knew him
had been swept out of exist instead were these frail creatur who
had forgotten their high ancestri and the white thing of which i went
in terror then i thought of the great fear that wa between the two
speci and for the first time with a sudden shiver came the clear
knowledg of what the meat i had seen might be yet it wa too
horribl i look at littl weena sleep besid me her face white
and starlik under the star and forthwith dismiss the thought
through that long night i held my mind off the morlock as well as i
could and while awai the time by try to fanci i could find sign
of the old constel in the new confus the sky kept veri
clear except for a hazi cloud or so no doubt i doze at time then
as my vigil wore on came a faint in the eastward sky like the
reflect of some colourless fire and the old moon rose thin and
peak and white and close behind and overtak it and overflow
it the dawn came pale at first and then grow pink and warm no
morlock had approach us inde i had seen none upon the hill that
night and in the confid of renew dai it almost seem to me that
my fear had been unreason i stood up and found my foot with the
loos heel swollen at the ankl and pain under the heel so i sat
down again took off my shoe and flung them awai
i awaken weena and we went down into the wood now green and
pleasant instead of black and forbid we found some fruit wherewith
to break our fast we soon met other of the dainti on laugh and
danc in the sunlight as though there wa no such thing in natur as
the night and then i thought onc more of the meat that i had seen i
felt assur now of what it wa and from the bottom of my heart i
piti thi last feebl rill from the great flood of human clearli
at some time in the longago of human decai the morlock food had run
short possibl thei had live on rat and suchlik vermin even now
man is far less discrimin and exclus in hi food than he
wasfar less than ani monkei hi prejudic against human flesh is no
deepseat instinct and so these inhuman son of men i tri to
look at the thing in a scientif spirit after all thei were less
human and more remot than our cannib ancestor of three or four
thousand year ago and the intellig that would have made thi
state of thing a torment had gone why should i troubl myself these
eloi were mere fat cattl which the antlik morlock preserv and
prei uponprob saw to the breed of and there wa weena
danc at my side
then i tri to preserv myself from the horror that wa come upon
me by regard it as a rigor punish of human selfish man
had been content to live in eas and delight upon the labour of hi
fellowman had taken necess as hi watchword and excus and in the
full of time necess had come home to him i even tri a
carlylelik scorn of thi wretch aristocraci in decai but thi
attitud of mind wa imposs howev great their intellectu
degrad the eloi had kept too much of the human form not to claim
my sympathi and to make me perforc a sharer in their degrad and
their fear
i had at that time veri vagu idea as to the cours i should pursu
my first wa to secur some safe place of refug and to make myself
such arm of metal or stone as i could contriv that necess wa
immedi in the next place i hope to procur some mean of fire so
that i should have the weapon of a torch at hand for noth i knew
would be more effici against these morlock then i want to
arrang some contriv to break open the door of bronz under the
white sphinx i had in mind a batter ram i had a persuas that if
i could enter those door and carri a blaze of light befor me i should
discov the time machin and escap i could not imagin the morlock
were strong enough to move it far awai weena i had resolv to bring
with me to our own time and turn such scheme over in my mind i
pursu our wai toward the build which my fanci had chosen as our
dwell

the palac of green porcelain
i found the palac of green porcelain when we approach it about
noon desert and fall into ruin onli rag vestig of glass
remain in it window and great sheet of the green face had
fallen awai from the corrod metal framework it lai veri high upon
a turfi down and look northeastward befor i enter it i wa
surpris to see a larg estuari or even creek where i judg
wandsworth and battersea must onc have been i thought thenthough i
never follow up the thoughtof what might have happen or might be
happen to the live thing in the sea
the materi of the palac prove on examin to be inde
porcelain and along the face of it i saw an inscript in some
unknown charact i thought rather foolishli that weena might help
me to interpret thi but i onli learnt that the bare idea of write
had never enter her head she alwai seem to me i fanci more
human than she wa perhap becaus her affect wa so human
within the big valv of the doorwhich were open and brokenw found
instead of the customari hall a long galleri lit by mani side window
at the first glanc i wa remind of a museum the tile floor wa
thick with dust and a remark arrai of miscellan object wa
shroud in the same grei cover then i perceiv stand strang
and gaunt in the centr of the hall what wa clearli the lower part of
a huge skeleton i recognis by the obliqu feet that it wa some
extinct creatur after the fashion of the megatherium the skull and
the upper bone lai besid it in the thick dust and in on place
where rainwat had drop through a leak in the roof the thing
itself had been worn awai further in the galleri wa the huge skeleton
barrel of a brontosauru my museum hypothesi wa confirm go
toward the side i found what appear to be slope shelv and
clear awai the thick dust i found the old familiar glass case of
our own time but thei must have been airtight to judg from the fair
preserv of some of their content
clearli we stood among the ruin of some latterdai south kensington
here appar wa the palontolog section and a veri splendid
arrai of fossil it must have been though the inevit process of
decai that had been stave off for a time and had through the
extinct of bacteria and fungi lost ninetynin hundredth of it
forc wa nevertheless with extrem sure if with extrem slow
at work again upon all it treasur here and there i found trace of
the littl peopl in the shape of rare fossil broken to piec or
thread in string upon reed and the case had in some instanc
been bodili removedbi the morlock as i judg the place wa veri
silent the thick dust deaden our footstep weena who had been
roll a sea urchin down the slope glass of a case present came
as i stare about me and veri quietli took my hand and stood besid
me
and at first i wa so much surpris by thi ancient monument of an
intellectu ag that i gave no thought to the possibl it
present even my preoccup about the time machin reced a
littl from my mind
to judg from the size of the place thi palac of green porcelain
had a great deal more in it than a galleri of palontolog possibl
histor galleri it might be even a librari to me at least in
my present circumst these would be vastli more interest than
thi spectacl of oldtim geologi in decai explor i found anoth
short galleri run transvers to the first thi appear to be
devot to miner and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind
run on gunpowd but i could find no saltpetr inde no
nitrat of ani kind doubtless thei had deliquesc ag ago yet the
sulphur hung in my mind and set up a train of think as for the
rest of the content of that galleri though on the whole thei were the
best preserv of all i saw i had littl interest i am no specialist
in mineralog and i went on down a veri ruinou aisl run parallel
to the first hall i had enter appar thi section had been
devot to natur histori but everyth had long sinc pass out of
recognit a few shrivel and blacken vestig of what had onc
been stuf anim desicc mummi in jar that had onc held
spirit a brown dust of depart plant that wa all i wa sorri for
that becaus i should have been glad to trace the patient
readjust by which the conquest of anim natur had been
attain then we came to a galleri of simpli coloss proport but
singularli illlit the floor of it run downward at a slight angl
from the end at which i enter at interv white globe hung from
the ceilingmani of them crack and smashedwhich suggest that
origin the place had been artifici lit here i wa more in my
element for rise on either side of me were the huge bulk of big
machin all greatli corrod and mani broken down but some still
fairli complet you know i have a certain weak for mechan and
i wa inclin to linger among these the more so as for the most part
thei had the interest of puzzl and i could make onli the vaguest
guess at what thei were for i fanci that if i could solv their
puzzl i should find myself in possess of power that might be of
us against the morlock
suddenli weena came veri close to my side so suddenli that she
startl me had it not been for her i do not think i should have
notic that the floor of the galleri slope at all footnot it mai
be of cours that the floor did not slope but that the museum wa
built into the side of a hill the end i had come in at wa quit
abov ground and wa lit by rare slitlik window as you went down
the length the ground came up against these window until at last
there wa a pit like the area of a london hous befor each and onli
a narrow line of daylight at the top i went slowli along puzzl
about the machin and had been too intent upon them to notic the
gradual diminut of the light until weena increas apprehens
drew my attent then i saw that the galleri ran down at last into a
thick dark i hesit and then as i look round me i saw that
the dust wa less abund and it surfac less even further awai
toward the dim it appear to be broken by a number of small
narrow footprint my sens of the immedi presenc of the morlock
reviv at that i felt that i wa wast my time in the academ
examin of machineri i call to mind that it wa alreadi far
advanc in the afternoon and that i had still no weapon no refug
and no mean of make a fire and then down in the remot black of
the galleri i heard a peculiar patter and the same odd nois i had
heard down the well
i took weena hand then struck with a sudden idea i left her and
turn to a machin from which project a lever not unlik those in a
signalbox clamber upon the stand and grasp thi lever in my
hand i put all my weight upon it sidewai suddenli weena desert
in the central aisl began to whimper i had judg the strength of
the lever pretti correctli for it snap after a minut strain and
i rejoin her with a mace in my hand more than suffici i judg
for ani morlock skull i might encount and i long veri much to kill
a morlock or so veri inhuman you mai think to want to go kill
on own descend but it wa imposs somehow to feel ani
human in the thing onli my disinclin to leav weena and a
persuas that if i began to slake my thirst for murder my time
machin might suffer restrain me from go straight down the
galleri and kill the brute i heard
well mace in on hand and weena in the other i went out of that
galleri and into anoth and still larger on which at the first
glanc remind me of a militari chapel hung with tatter flag the
brown and char rag that hung from the side of it i present
recognis as the decai vestig of book thei had long sinc
drop to piec and everi semblanc of print had left them but here
and there were warp board and crack metal clasp that told the
tale well enough had i been a literari man i might perhap have
moralis upon the futil of all ambit but as it wa the thing
that struck me with keenest forc wa the enorm wast of labour to
which thi sombr wilder of rot paper testifi at the time i
will confess that i thought chiefli of the philosoph transact
and my own seventeen paper upon physic optic
then go up a broad staircas we came to what mai onc have been a
galleri of technic chemistri and here i had not a littl hope of
us discoveri except at on end where the roof had collaps
thi galleri wa well preserv i went eagerli to everi unbroken case
and at last in on of the realli airtight case i found a box of
match veri eagerli i tri them thei were perfectli good thei were
not even damp i turn to weena danc i cri to her in her own
tongu for now i had a weapon inde against the horribl creatur we
fear and so in that derelict museum upon the thick soft carpet
of dust to weena huge delight i solemnli perform a kind of
composit danc whistl the land of the leal as cheerfulli as i
could in part it wa a modest cancan in part a step danc in part
a skirt danc so far as my tailcoat permit and in part origin
for i am natur invent as you know
now i still think that for thi box of match to have escap the
wear of time for immemori year wa a most strang as for me it wa
a most fortun thing yet oddli enough i found a far unlikeli
substanc and that wa camphor i found it in a seal jar that by
chanc i suppos had been realli hermet seal i fanci at
first that it wa paraffin wax and smash the glass accordingli but
the odour of camphor wa unmistak in the univers decai thi
volatil substanc had chanc to surviv perhap through mani
thousand of centuri it remind me of a sepia paint i had onc
seen done from the ink of a fossil belemnit that must have perish
and becom fossilis million of year ago i wa about to throw it
awai but i rememb that it wa inflamm and burnt with a good
bright flamewa in fact an excel candleand i put it in my
pocket i found no explos howev nor ani mean of break down
the bronz door as yet my iron crowbar wa the most help thing i
had chanc upon nevertheless i left that galleri greatli elat
i cannot tell you all the stori of that long afternoon it would
requir a great effort of memori to recal my explor in at all
the proper order i rememb a long galleri of rust stand of arm
and how i hesit between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword i
could not carri both howev and my bar of iron promis best against
the bronz gate there were number of gun pistol and rifl the
most were mass of rust but mani were of some new metal and still
fairli sound but ani cartridg or powder there mai onc have been had
rot into dust on corner i saw wa char and shatter perhap
i thought by an explos among the specimen in anoth place wa a
vast arrai of idolspolynesian mexican grecian phnician everi
countri on earth i should think and here yield to an irresist
impuls i wrote my name upon the nose of a steatit monster from south
america that particularli took my fanci
as the even drew on my interest wane i went through galleri
after galleri dusti silent often ruinou the exhibit sometim
mere heap of rust and lignit sometim fresher in on place i
suddenli found myself near the model of a tin mine and then by the
merest accid i discov in an airtight case two dynamit
cartridg i shout eureka and smash the case with joi then
came a doubt i hesit then select a littl side galleri i
made my essai i never felt such a disappoint as i did in wait
five ten fifteen minut for an explos that never came of cours
the thing were dummi as i might have guess from their presenc i
realli believ that had thei not been so i should have rush off
incontin and blown sphinx bronz door and as it prove my
chanc of find the time machin all togeth into nonexist
it wa after that i think that we came to a littl open court within
the palac it wa turf and had three fruittre so we rest and
refresh ourselv toward sunset i began to consid our posit
night wa creep upon us and my inaccess hidingplac had still
to be found but that troubl me veri littl now i had in my
possess a thing that wa perhap the best of all defenc against
the morlocksi had match i had the camphor in my pocket too if a
blaze were need it seem to me that the best thing we could do
would be to pass the night in the open protect by a fire in the
morn there wa the get of the time machin toward that as
yet i had onli my iron mace but now with my grow knowledg i
felt veri differ toward those bronz door up to thi i had
refrain from forc them larg becaus of the mysteri on the
other side thei had never impress me as be veri strong and i
hope to find my bar of iron not altogeth inadequ for the work
xii
in the dark
we emerg from the palac while the sun wa still in part abov the
horizon i wa determin to reach the white sphinx earli the next
morn and er the dusk i purpos push through the wood that had
stop me on the previou journei my plan wa to go as far as
possibl that night and then build a fire to sleep in the
protect of it glare accordingli as we went along i gather ani
stick or dri grass i saw and present had my arm full of such
litter thu load our progress wa slower than i had anticip
and besid weena wa tire and i also began to suffer from
sleepi too so that it wa full night befor we reach the wood
upon the shrubbi hill of it edg weena would have stop fear the
dark befor us but a singular sens of impend calam that
should inde have serv me as a warn drove me onward i had been
without sleep for a night and two dai and i wa feverish and
irrit i felt sleep come upon me and the morlock with it
while we hesit among the black bush behind us and dim against
their black i saw three crouch figur there wa scrub and
long grass all about us and i did not feel safe from their insidi
approach the forest i calcul wa rather less than a mile across
if we could get through it to the bare hillsid there as it seem to
me wa an altogeth safer restingplac i thought that with my
match and my camphor i could contriv to keep my path illumin
through the wood yet it wa evid that if i wa to flourish match
with my hand i should have to abandon my firewood so rather
reluctantli i put it down and then it came into my head that i would
amaz our friend behind by light it i wa to discov the
atroci folli of thi proceed but it came to my mind as an
ingeni move for cover our retreat
i dont know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be
in the absenc of man and in a temper climat the sun heat is
rare strong enough to burn even when it is focus by dewdrop as
is sometim the case in more tropic district lightn mai blast
and blacken but it rare give rise to widespread fire decai
veget mai occasion smoulder with the heat of it ferment
but thi rare result in flame in thi decad too the art of
firemak had been forgotten on the earth the red tongu that went
lick up my heap of wood were an altogeth new and strang thing to
weena
she want to run to it and plai with it i believ she would have
cast herself into it had i not restrain her but i caught her up and
in spite of her struggl plung boldli befor me into the wood for
a littl wai the glare of my fire lit the path look back present
i could see through the crowd stem that from my heap of stick the
blaze had spread to some bush adjac and a curv line of fire wa
creep up the grass of the hill i laugh at that and turn again
to the dark tree befor me it wa veri black and weena clung to me
convuls but there wa still as my ey grew accustom to the
dark suffici light for me to avoid the stem overhead it wa
simpli black except where a gap of remot blue sky shone down upon us
here and there i lit none of my match becaus i had no hand free
upon my left arm i carri my littl on in my right hand i had my
iron bar
for some wai i heard noth but the crackl twig under my feet
the faint rustl of the breez abov and my own breath and the
throb of the bloodvessel in my ear then i seem to know of a
patter behind me i push on grimli the patter grew more
distinct and then i caught the same queer sound and voic i had heard
in the underworld there were evid sever of the morlock and
thei were close in upon me inde in anoth minut i felt a tug at
my coat then someth at my arm and weena shiver violent and
becam quit still
it wa time for a match but to get on i must put her down i did so
and as i fumbl with my pocket a struggl began in the dark
about my knee perfectli silent on her part and with the same peculiar
coo sound from the morlock soft littl hand too were creep
over my coat and back touch even my neck then the match scratch
and fizz i held it flare and saw the white back of the morlock
in flight amid the tree i hastili took a lump of camphor from my
pocket and prepar to light it as soon as the match should wane then
i look at weena she wa ly clutch my feet and quit
motionless with her face to the ground with a sudden fright i stoop
to her she seem scarc to breath i lit the block of camphor and
flung it to the ground and as it split and flare up and drove back
the morlock and the shadow i knelt down and lift her the wood
behind seem full of the stir and murmur of a great compani
she seem to have faint i put her carefulli upon my shoulder and
rose to push on and then there came a horribl realis in
manuvr with my match and weena i had turn myself about sever
time and now i had not the faintest idea in what direct lai my
path for all i knew i might be face back toward the palac of
green porcelain i found myself in a cold sweat i had to think rapidli
what to do i determin to build a fire and encamp where we were i
put weena still motionless down upon a turfi bole and veri hastili
as my first lump of camphor wane i began collect stick and
leav here and there out of the dark round me the morlock ey
shone like carbuncl
the camphor flicker and went out i lit a match and as i did so
two white form that had been approach weena dash hastili awai
on wa so blind by the light that he came straight for me and i
felt hi bone grind under the blow of my fist he gave a whoop of
dismai stagger a littl wai and fell down i lit anoth piec of
camphor and went on gather my bonfir present i notic how dry
wa some of the foliag abov me for sinc my arriv on the time
machin a matter of a week no rain had fallen so instead of cast
about among the tree for fallen twig i began leap up and drag
down branch veri soon i had a choke smoki fire of green wood and
dry stick and could economis my camphor then i turn to where
weena lai besid my iron mace i tri what i could to reviv her but
she lai like on dead i could not even satisfi myself whether or not
she breath
now the smoke of the fire beat over toward me and it must have made
me heavi of a sudden moreov the vapour of camphor wa in the air
my fire would not need replenish for an hour or so i felt veri
weari after my exert and sat down the wood too wa full of a
slumbrou murmur that i did not understand i seem just to nod and
open my ey but all wa dark and the morlock had their hand upon
me fling off their cling finger i hastili felt in my pocket for
the matchbox andit had gone then thei grip and close with me
again in a moment i knew what had happen i had slept and my fire
had gone out and the bitter of death came over my soul the forest
seem full of the smell of burn wood i wa caught by the neck by
the hair by the arm and pull down it wa indescrib horribl
in the dark to feel all these soft creatur heap upon me i felt
as if i wa in a monstrou spider web i wa overpow and went
down i felt littl teeth nip at my neck i roll over and as i
did so my hand came against my iron lever it gave me strength i
struggl up shake the human rat from me and hold the bar
short i thrust where i judg their face might be i could feel the
succul give of flesh and bone under my blow and for a moment i
wa free
the strang exult that so often seem to accompani hard fight
came upon me i knew that both i and weena were lost but i determin
to make the morlock pai for their meat i stood with my back to a
tree swing the iron bar befor me the whole wood wa full of the
stir and cri of them a minut pass their voic seem to rise to
a higher pitch of excit and their movement grew faster yet none
came within reach i stood glare at the black then suddenli came
hope what if the morlock were afraid and close on the heel of that
came a strang thing the dark seem to grow lumin veri dimli
i began to see the morlock about methre batter at my feetand then
i recognis with incredul surpris that the other were run
in an incess stream as it seem from behind me and awai through
the wood in front and their back seem no longer white but reddish
as i stood agap i saw a littl red spark go drift across a gap of
starlight between the branch and vanish and at that i understood
the smell of burn wood the slumbrou murmur that wa grow now
into a gusti roar the red glow and the morlock flight
step out from behind my tree and look back i saw through the
black pillar of the nearer tree the flame of the burn forest it
wa my first fire come after me with that i look for weena but
she wa gone the hiss and crackl behind me the explos thud
as each fresh tree burst into flame left littl time for reflect
my iron bar still grip i follow in the morlock path it wa a
close race onc the flame crept forward so swiftli on my right as i
ran that i wa outflank and had to strike off to the left but at
last i emerg upon a small open space and as i did so a morlock came
blunder toward me and past me and went on straight into the fire
and now i wa to see the most weird and horribl thing i think of
all that i beheld in that futur ag thi whole space wa as bright as
dai with the reflect of the fire in the centr wa a hillock or
tumulu surmount by a scorch hawthorn beyond thi wa anoth arm
of the burn forest with yellow tongu alreadi writh from it
complet encircl the space with a fenc of fire upon the hillsid
were some thirti or forti morlock dazzl by the light and heat and
blunder hither and thither against each other in their bewilder
at first i did not realis their blind and struck furious at
them with my bar in a frenzi of fear as thei approach me kill
on and crippl sever more but when i had watch the gestur of
on of them grope under the hawthorn against the red sky and heard
their moan i wa assur of their absolut helpless and miseri in
the glare and i struck no more of them
yet everi now and then on would come straight toward me set
loos a quiver horror that made me quick to elud him at on time
the flame di down somewhat and i fear the foul creatur would
present be abl to see me i wa think of begin the fight by
kill some of them befor thi should happen but the fire burst out
again brightli and i stai my hand i walk about the hill among
them and avoid them look for some trace of weena but weena wa
gone
at last i sat down on the summit of the hillock and watch thi
strang incred compani of blind thing grope to and fro and
make uncanni nois to each other as the glare of the fire beat on
them the coil uprush of smoke stream across the sky and through
the rare tatter of that red canopi remot as though thei belong to
anoth univers shone the littl star two or three morlock came
blunder into me and i drove them off with blow of my fist
trembl as i did so
for the most part of that night i wa persuad it wa a nightmar i
bit myself and scream in a passion desir to awak i beat the
ground with my hand and got up and sat down again and wander here
and there and again sat down then i would fall to rub my ey and
call upon god to let me awak thrice i saw morlock put their head
down in a kind of agoni and rush into the flame but at last abov
the subsid red of the fire abov the stream mass of black
smoke and the whiten and blacken tree stump and the diminish
number of these dim creatur came the white light of the dai
i search again for trace of weena but there were none it wa
plain that thei had left her poor littl bodi in the forest i cannot
describ how it reliev me to think that it had escap the aw fate
to which it seem destin as i thought of that i wa almost move
to begin a massacr of the helpless abomin about me but i
contain myself the hillock as i have said wa a kind of island in
the forest from it summit i could now make out through a haze of
smoke the palac of green porcelain and from that i could get my
bear for the white sphinx and so leav the remnant of these
damn soul still go hither and thither and moan as the dai
grew clearer i ti some grass about my feet and limp on across
smoke ash and among black stem that still pulsat intern with
fire toward the hidingplac of the time machin i walk slowli
for i wa almost exhaust as well as lame and i felt the intensest
wretched for the horribl death of littl weena it seem an
overwhelm calam now in thi old familiar room it is more like
the sorrow of a dream than an actual loss but that morn it left me
absolut lone againterr alon i began to think of thi hous
of mine of thi firesid of some of you and with such thought came
a long that wa pain
but as i walk over the smoke ash under the bright morn sky
i made a discoveri in my trouser pocket were still some loos match
the box must have leak befor it wa lost
xiii
the trap of the white sphinx
about eight or nine in the morn i came to the same seat of yellow
metal from which i had view the world upon the even of my arriv
i thought of my hasti conclus upon that even and could not
refrain from laugh bitterli at my confid here wa the same
beauti scene the same abund foliag the same splendid palac
and magnific ruin the same silver river run between it
fertil bank the gai robe of the beauti peopl move hither and
thither among the tree some were bath in exactli the place where i
had save weena and that suddenli gave me a keen stab of pain and
like blot upon the landscap rose the cupola abov the wai to the
underworld i understood now what all the beauti of the overworld
peopl cover veri pleasant wa their dai as pleasant as the dai of
the cattl in the field like the cattl thei knew of no enemi and
provid against no need and their end wa the same
i griev to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had
been it had commit suicid it had set itself steadfastli toward
comfort and eas a balanc societi with secur and perman as
it watchword it had attain it hopesto come to thi at last onc
life and properti must have reach almost absolut safeti the rich
had been assur of hi wealth and comfort the toiler assur of hi
life and work no doubt in that perfect world there had been no
unemploi problem no social question left unsolv and a great quiet
had follow
it is a law of natur we overlook that intellectu versatil is
the compens for chang danger and troubl an anim perfectli
in harmoni with it environ is a perfect mechan natur never
appeal to intellig until habit and instinct ar useless there is
no intellig where there is no chang and no need of chang onli
those anim partak of intellig that have to meet a huge varieti
of need and danger
so as i see it the upperworld man had drift toward hi feebl
pretti and the underworld to mere mechan industri but that
perfect state had lack on thing even for mechan
perfectionabsolut perman appar as time went on the feed
of an underworld howev it wa effect had becom disjoint
mother necess who had been stave off for a few thousand year
came back again and she began below the underworld be in contact
with machineri which howev perfect still need some littl thought
outsid habit had probabl retain perforc rather more initi
if less of everi other human charact than the upper and when other
meat fail them thei turn to what old habit had hitherto forbidden
so i sai i saw it in my last view of the world of eight hundr and two
thousand seven hundr and on it mai be as wrong an explan as
mortal wit could invent it is how the thing shape itself to me and
as that i give it to you
after the fatigu excit and terror of the past dai and in
spite of my grief thi seat and the tranquil view and the warm
sunlight were veri pleasant i wa veri tire and sleepi and soon my
theoris pass into doze catch myself at that i took my own
hint and spread myself out upon the turf i had a long and
refresh sleep
i awok a littl befor sunset i now felt safe against be
caught nap by the morlock and stretch myself i came on down
the hill toward the white sphinx i had my crowbar in on hand and
the other hand plai with the match in my pocket
and now came a most unexpect thing as i approach the pedest of
the sphinx i found the bronz valv were open thei had slid down into
groov
at that i stop short befor them hesit to enter
within wa a small apart and on a rais place in the corner of
thi wa the time machin i had the small lever in my pocket so
here after all my elabor prepar for the sieg of the white
sphinx wa a meek surrend i threw my iron bar awai almost sorri
not to us it
a sudden thought came into my head as i stoop toward the portal
for onc at least i grasp the mental oper of the morlock
suppress a strong inclin to laugh i step through the bronz
frame and up to the time machin i wa surpris to find it had been
carefulli oil and clean i have suspect sinc that the morlock
had even partial taken it to piec while try in their dim wai to
grasp it purpos
now as i stood and examin it find a pleasur in the mere touch
of the contriv the thing i had expect happen the bronz
panel suddenli slid up and struck the frame with a clang i wa in the
darktrap so the morlock thought at that i chuckl gleefulli
i could alreadi hear their murmur laughter as thei came toward me
veri calmli i tri to strike the match i had onli to fix on the
lever and depart then like a ghost but i had overlook on littl
thing the match were of that abomin kind that light onli on the
box
you mai imagin how all my calm vanish the littl brute were close
upon me on touch me i made a sweep blow in the dark at them
with the lever and began to scrambl into the saddl of the machin
then came on hand upon me and then anoth then i had simpli to fight
against their persist finger for my lever and at the same time
feel for the stud over which these fit on inde thei almost
got awai from me as it slip from my hand i had to butt in the dark
with my headi could hear the morlock skull ringto recov it it
wa a nearer thing than the fight in the forest i think thi last
scrambl
but at last the lever wa fix and pull over the cling hand
slip from me the dark present fell from my ey i found
myself in the same grei light and tumult i have alreadi describ
xiv
the further vision
i have alreadi told you of the sick and confus that come with
time travel and thi time i wa not seat properli in the saddl
but sidewai and in an unstabl fashion for an indefinit time i clung
to the machin as it swai and vibrat quit unheed how i went
and when i brought myself to look at the dial again i wa amaz to
find where i had arriv on dial record dai and anoth thousand
of dai anoth million of dai and anoth thousand of million
now instead of revers the lever i had pull them over so as to
go forward with them and when i came to look at these indic i
found that the thousand hand wa sweep round as fast as the second
hand of a watchinto futur
as i drove on a peculiar chang crept over the appear of thing
the palpit grey grew darker thenthough i wa still
travel with prodigi velocityth blink success of dai and
night which wa usual indic of a slower pace return and
grew more and more mark thi puzzl me veri much at first the
altern of night and dai grew slower and slower and so did the
passag of the sun across the sky until thei seem to stretch through
centuri at last a steadi twilight brood over the earth a twilight
onli broken now and then when a comet glare across the darkl sky
the band of light that had indic the sun had long sinc
disappear for the sun had ceas to setit simpli rose and fell in
the west and grew ever broader and more red all trace of the moon had
vanish the circl of the star grow slower and slower had
given place to creep point of light at last some time befor i
stop the sun red and veri larg halt motionless upon the
horizon a vast dome glow with a dull heat and now and then
suffer a momentari extinct at on time it had for a littl while
glow more brilliantli again but it speedili revert to it sullen
red heat i perceiv by thi slow down of it rise and set
that the work of the tidal drag wa done the earth had come to rest
with on face to the sun even as in our own time the moon face the
earth veri cautious for i rememb my former headlong fall i
began to revers my motion slower and slower went the circl hand
until the thousand on seem motionless and the daili on wa no
longer a mere mist upon it scale still slower until the dim outlin
of a desol beach grew visibl
i stop veri gentli and sat upon the time machin look round
the sky wa no longer blue northeastward it wa inki black and out
of the black shone brightli and steadili the pale white star
overhead it wa a deep indian red and starless and southeastward it
grew brighter to a glow scarlet where cut by the horizon lai the
huge hull of the sun red and motionless the rock about me were of a
harsh reddish colour and all the trace of life that i could see at
first wa the intens green veget that cover everi project
point on their southeastern face it wa the same rich green that on
see on forest moss or on the lichen in cave plant which like these
grow in a perpetu twilight
the machin wa stand on a slope beach the sea stretch awai to
the southwest to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan
sky there were no breaker and no wave for not a breath of wind wa
stir onli a slight oili swell rose and fell like a gentl
breath and show that the etern sea wa still move and live
and along the margin where the water sometim broke wa a thick
incrust of saltpink under the lurid sky there wa a sens of
oppress in my head and i notic that i wa breath veri fast
the sensat remind me of my onli experi of mountain and
from that i judg the air to be more rarefi than it is now
far awai up the desol slope i heard a harsh scream and saw a thing
like a huge white butterfli go slant and flutter up into the sky
and circl disappear over some low hillock beyond the sound of
it voic wa so dismal that i shiver and seat myself more firmli
upon the machin look round me again i saw that quit near what
i had taken to be a reddish mass of rock wa move slowli toward me
then i saw the thing wa realli a monstrou crablik creatur can you
imagin a crab as larg as yonder tabl with it mani leg move
slowli and uncertainli it big claw swai it long antenn like
carter whip wave and feel and it stalk ey gleam at
you on either side of it metal front it back wa corrug and
ornament with ungainli boss and a greenish incrust blotch
it here and there i could see the mani palp of it complic mouth
flicker and feel as it move
as i stare at thi sinist apparit crawl toward me i felt a
tickl on my cheek as though a fly had light there i tri to
brush it awai with my hand but in a moment it return and almost
immedi came anoth by my ear i struck at thi and caught
someth threadlik it wa drawn swiftli out of my hand with a
fright qualm i turn and i saw that i had grasp the antenna of
anoth monster crab that stood just behind me it evil ey were
wriggl on their stalk it mouth wa all aliv with appetit and
it vast ungainli claw smear with an algal slime were descend
upon me in a moment my hand wa on the lever and i had place a month
between myself and these monster but i wa still on the same beach
and i saw them distinctli now as soon as i stop dozen of them
seem to be crawl here and there in the sombr light among the
foliat sheet of intens green
i cannot convei the sens of abomin desol that hung over the
world the red eastern sky the northward black the salt dead sea
the stoni beach crawl with these foul slowstir monster the
uniform poisonouslook green of the lichen plant the thin air
that hurt on lung all contribut to an appal effect i move
on a hundr year and there wa the same red suna littl larger a
littl dullerth same dy sea the same chill air and the same
crowd of earthi crustacea creep in and out among the green weed and
the red rock and in the westward sky i saw a curv pale line like a
vast new moon
so i travel stop ever and again in great stride of a
thousand year or more drawn on by the mysteri of the earth fate
watch with a strang fascin the sun grow larger and duller in
the westward sky and the life of the old earth ebb awai at last more
than thirti million year henc the huge redhot dome of the sun had
come to obscur nearli a tenth part of the darkl heaven then i
stop onc more for the crawl multitud of crab had disappear
and the red beach save for it livid green liverwort and lichen
seem lifeless and now it wa fleck with white a bitter cold
assail me rare white flake ever and again came eddi down to the
northeastward the glare of snow lai under the starlight of the sabl
sky and i could see an undul crest of hillock pinkish white
there were fring of ic along the sea margin with drift mass
farther out but the main expans of that salt ocean all bloodi under
the etern sunset wa still unfrozen
i look about me to see if ani trace of anim life remain a
certain indefin apprehens still kept me in the saddl of the
machin but i saw noth move in earth or sky or sea the green
slime on the rock alon testifi that life wa not extinct a shallow
sandbank had appear in the sea and the water had reced from the
beach i fanci i saw some black object flop about upon thi bank
but it becam motionless as i look at it and i judg that my ey
had been deceiv and that the black object wa mere a rock the
star in the sky were intens bright and seem to me to twinkl veri
littl
suddenli i notic that the circular westward outlin of the sun had
chang that a concav a bai had appear in the curv i saw thi
grow larger for a minut perhap i stare aghast at thi black
that wa creep over the dai and then i realis that an eclips wa
begin either the moon or the planet mercuri wa pass across the
sun disk natur at first i took it to be the moon but there is
much to inclin me to believ that what i realli saw wa the transit of
an inner planet pass veri near to the earth
the dark grew apac a cold wind began to blow in freshen gust
from the east and the shower white flake in the air increas in
number from the edg of the sea came a rippl and whisper beyond
these lifeless sound the world wa silent silent it would be hard to
convei the still of it all the sound of man the bleat of
sheep the cri of bird the hum of insect the stir that make the
background of our livesal that wa over as the dark thicken
the eddi flake grew more abund danc befor my ey and the
cold of the air more intens at last on by on swiftli on after
the other the white peak of the distant hill vanish into
black the breez rose to a moan wind i saw the black central
shadow of the eclips sweep toward me in anoth moment the pale
star alon were visibl all els wa rayless obscur the sky wa
absolut black
a horror of thi great dark came on me the cold that smote to my
marrow and the pain i felt in breath overcam me i shiver and
a deadli nausea seiz me then like a redhot bow in the sky appear
the edg of the sun i got off the machin to recov myself i felt
giddi and incap of face the return journei as i stood sick and
confus i saw again the move thing upon the shoalther wa no
mistak now that it wa a move thingagainst the red water of the
sea it wa a round thing the size of a footbal perhap or it mai
be bigger and tentacl trail down from it it seem black against
the welter bloodr water and it wa hop fitfulli about then
i felt i wa faint but a terribl dread of ly helpless in that
remot and aw twilight sustain me while i clamber upon the
saddl

the time travel return
so i came back for a long time i must have been insens upon the
machin the blink success of the dai and night wa resum
the sun got golden again the sky blue i breath with greater
freedom the fluctuat contour of the land eb and flow the
hand spun backward upon the dial at last i saw again the dim shadow
of hous the evid of decad human these too chang and
pass and other came present when the million dial wa at zero
i slacken speed i began to recognis our own pretti and familiar
architectur the thousand hand ran back to the startingpoint the
night and dai flap slower and slower then the old wall of the
laboratori came round me veri gentli now i slow the mechan
down
i saw on littl thing that seem odd to me i think i have told you
that when i set out befor my veloc becam veri high mr watchett
had walk across the room travel as it seem to me like a
rocket as i return i pass again across that minut when she
travers the laboratori but now her everi motion appear to be the
exact invers of her previou on the door at the lower end open
and she glide quietli up the laboratori back foremost and
disappear behind the door by which she had previous enter just
befor that i seem to see hillyer for a moment but he pass like a
flash
then i stop the machin and saw about me again the old familiar
laboratori my tool my applianc just as i had left them i got off
the thing veri shakili and sat down upon my bench for sever minut
i trembl violent then i becam calmer around me wa my old
workshop again exactli as it had been i might have slept there and
the whole thing have been a dream
and yet not exactli the thing had start from the southeast corner
of the laboratori it had come to rest again in the northwest against
the wall where you saw it that give you the exact distanc from my
littl lawn to the pedest of the white sphinx into which the
morlock had carri my machin
for a time my brain went stagnant present i got up and came through
the passag here limp becaus my heel wa still pain and
feel sore begrim i saw the pall mall gazett on the tabl by
the door i found the date wa inde todai and look at the
timepiec saw the hour wa almost eight oclock i heard your voic

assert of it truth as a mere stroke of art to enhanc it interest
and take it as a stori what do you think of it
he took up hi pipe and began in hi old accustom manner to tap
with it nervous upon the bar of the grate there wa a momentari
still then chair began to creak and shoe to scrape upon the
carpet i took my ey off the time travel face and look round
at hi audienc thei were in the dark and littl spot of colour swam
befor them the medic man seem absorb in the contempl of
our host the editor wa look hard at the end of hi cigarth
sixth the journalist fumbl for hi watch the other as far as i
rememb were motionless
the editor stood up with a sigh what a piti it is your not a writer
of stori he said put hi hand on the time travel
shoulder
you dont believ it
well
i thought not
the time travel turn to us where ar the match he said he
lit on and spoke over hi pipe puf to tell you the truth i
hardli believ it myself and yet
hi ey fell with a mute inquiri upon the wither white flower upon
the littl tabl then he turn over the hand hold hi pipe and i
saw he wa look at some halfheal scar on hi knuckl
the medic man rose came to the lamp and examin the flower the
gynceum odd he said the psychologist leant forward to see

im hang if it isnt a quarter to on said the journalist how
shall we get home
plenti of cab at the station said the psychologist
it a curiou thing said the medic man but i certainli dont
know the natur order of these flower mai i have them

try to keep hold of an idea that elud him thei were put into my
pocket by weena when i travel into time he stare round the room
im damn if it isnt all go thi room and you and the atmospher
of everi dai is too much for my memori did i ever make a time machin
or a model of a time machin or is it all onli a dream thei sai life
is a dream a preciou poor dream at timesbut i cant stand anoth
that wont fit it mad and where did the dream come from i
must look at that machin if there is on
he caught up the lamp swiftli and carri it flare red through the
door into the corridor we follow him there in the flicker light
of the lamp wa the machin sure enough squat ugli and askew a
thing of brass eboni ivori and transluc glimmer quartz solid
to the touchfor i put out my hand and felt the rail of itand with
brown spot and smear upon the ivori and bit of grass and moss upon
the lower part and on rail bent awri
the time travel put the lamp down on the bench and ran hi hand
along the damag rail it all right now he said the stori i
told you wa true im sorri to have brought you out here in the cold
he took up the lamp and in an absolut silenc we return to the
smokingroom

elbow to shake im frightfulli busi said he with that thing in
there
but is it not some hoax i said do you realli travel through time
realli and truli i do and he look frankli into my ey he
hesit hi ey wander about the room i onli want half an hour
he said i know why you came and it awfulli good of you there
some magazin here if youll stop to lunch ill prove you thi time
travel up to the hilt specimen and all if youll forgiv my
leav you now
i consent hardli comprehend then the full import of hi word
and he nod and went on down the corridor i heard the door of the
laboratori slam seat myself in a chair and took up a daili paper
what wa he go to do befor lunchtim then suddenli i wa remind
by an advertis that i had promis to meet richardson the
publish at two i look at my watch and saw that i could bare
save that engag i got up and went down the passag to tell the
time travel
as i took hold of the handl of the door i heard an exclam oddli
truncat at the end and a click and a thud a gust of air whirl
round me as i open the door and from within came the sound of broken
glass fall on the floor the time travel wa not there i seem
to see a ghostli indistinct figur sit in a whirl mass of black
and brass for a momenta figur so transpar that the bench behind
with it sheet of draw wa absolut distinct but thi phantasm
vanish as i rub my ey the time machin had gone save for a
subsid stir of dust the further end of the laboratori wa empti a
pane of the skylight had appar just been blown in
i felt an unreason amaz i knew that someth strang had
happen and for the moment could not distinguish what the strang
thing might be as i stood stare the door into the garden open
and the manserv appear
we look at each other then idea began to come ha mr gone out
that wai said i
no sir no on ha come out thi wai i wa expect to find him
here
at that i understood at the risk of disappoint richardson i stai
on wait for the time travel wait for the second perhap
still stranger stori and the specimen and photograph he would bring
with him but i am begin now to fear that i must wait a lifetim
the time travel vanish three year ago and as everybodi know
now he ha never return
epilogu
on cannot choos but wonder will he ever return it mai be that he
swept back into the past and fell among the blooddrink hairi
savag of the ag of unpolish stone into the abyss of the
cretac sea or among the grotesqu saurian the huge reptilian
brute of the jurass time he mai even nowif i mai us the
phraseb wander on some plesiosaurushaunt oolit coral reef or
besid the lone salin sea of the triassic ag or did he go
forward into on of the nearer ag in which men ar still men but
with the riddl of our own time answer and it wearisom problem
solv into the manhood of the race for i for my own part cannot
think that these latter dai of weak experi fragmentari theori
and mutual discord ar inde man culmin time i sai for my own
part he i knowfor the question had been discuss among us long
befor the time machin wa madethought but cheerlessli of the
advanc of mankind and saw in the grow pile of civilis
onli a foolish heap that must inevit fall back upon and destroi
it maker in the end if that is so it remain for us to live as
though it were not so but to me the futur is still black and blanki
a vast ignor lit at a few casual place by the memori of hi
stori and i have by me for my comfort two strang white
flowersshrivel now and brown and flat and brittleto wit that
even when mind and strength had gone gratitud and a mutual tender
still live on in the heart of man
