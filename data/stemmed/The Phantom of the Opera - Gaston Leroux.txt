the phantom of the opera
prologu
in which the author of thi singular work inform the reader how he
acquir the certainti that the opera ghost realli exist
the opera ghost realli exist he wa not as wa long believ a
creatur of the imagin of the artist the superstit of the
manag or a product of the absurd and impression brain of the
young ladi of the ballet their mother the boxkeep the
cloakroom attend or the concierg ye he exist in flesh and
blood although he assum the complet appear of a real phantom
that is to sai of a spectral shade
when i began to ransack the archiv of the nation academi of music i
wa at onc struck by the surpris coincid between the phenomena
ascrib to the ghost and the most extraordinari and fantast
tragedi that ever excit the pari upper class and i soon conceiv
the idea that thi tragedi might reason be explain by the
phenomena in question the event do not date more than thirti year
back and it would not be difficult to find at the present dai in the
foyer of the ballet old men of the highest respect men upon
whose word on could absolut reli who would rememb as though thei
happen yesterdai the mysteri and dramat condit that attend
the kidnap of christin daae the disappear of the vicomt de
chagni and the death of hi elder brother count philipp whose bodi
wa found on the bank of the lake that exist in the lower cellar of
the opera on the ruescrib side but none of those wit had
until that dai thought that there wa ani reason for connect the
more or less legendari figur of the opera ghost with that terribl
stori
the truth wa slow to enter my mind puzzl by an inquiri that at
everi moment wa complic by event which at first sight might be
look upon as superhuman and more than onc i wa within an ac of
abandon a task in which i wa exhaust myself in the hopeless
pursuit of a vain imag at last i receiv the proof that my
presenti had not deceiv me and i wa reward for all my
effort on the dai when i acquir the certainti that the opera ghost
wa more than a mere shade
on that dai i had spent long hour over the memoir of a manag the
light and frivol work of the tooskept moncharmin who dure
hi term at the opera understood noth of the mysteri behavior of
the ghost and who wa make all the fun of it that he could at the
veri moment when he becam the first victim of the curiou financi
oper that went on insid the magic envelop
i had just left the librari in despair when i met the delight
actingmanag of our nation academi who stood chat on a land
with a live and wellgroom littl old man to whom he introduc me
gaili the actingmanag knew all about my investig and how
eagerli and unsuccessfulli i had been try to discov the
whereabout of the examin magistr in the famou chagni case m
faur nobodi knew what had becom of him aliv or dead and here he
wa back from canada where he had spent fifteen year and the first
thing he had done on hi return to pari wa to come to the
secretari offic at the opera and ask for a free seat the littl
old man wa m faur himself
we spent a good part of the even togeth and he told me the whole
chagni case as he had understood it at the time he wa bound to
conclud in favor of the mad of the viscount and the accident
death of the elder brother for lack of evid to the contrari but
he wa nevertheless persuad that a terribl tragedi had taken place
between the two brother in connect with christin daae he could
not tell me what becam of christin or the viscount when i mention
the ghost he onli laugh he too had been told of the curiou
manifest that seem to point to the exist of an abnorm
be resid in on of the most mysteri corner of the opera and
he knew the stori of the envelop but he had never seen anyth in it
worthi of hi attent as magistr in charg of the chagni case and
it wa as much as he had done to listen to the evid of a wit
who appear of hi own accord and declar that he had often met the
ghost thi wit wa none other than the man whom all pari call
the persian and who wa wellknown to everi subscrib to the opera
the magistr took him for a visionari
i wa immens interest by thi stori of the persian i want if
there were still time to find thi valuabl and eccentr wit my
luck began to improv and i discov him in hi littl flat in the
rue de rivoli where he had live ever sinc and where he di five
month after my visit i wa at first inclin to be suspici but
when the persian had told me with childlik candor all that he knew
about the ghost and had hand me the proof of the ghost
existenceinclud the strang correspond of christin daaeto
do as i pleas with i wa no longer abl to doubt no the ghost wa
not a myth
i have i know been told that thi correspond mai have been forg
from first to last by a man whose imagin had certainli been fed on
the most seduct tale but fortun i discov some of
christin write outsid the famou bundl of letter and on a
comparison between the two all my doubt were remov i also went
into the past histori of the persian and found that he wa an upright
man incap of invent a stori that might have defeat the end
of justic
thi moreov wa the opinion of the more seriou peopl who at on
time or other were mix up in the chagni case who were friend of
the chagni famili to whom i show all my document and set forth all
my infer in thi connect i should like to print a few line
which i receiv from gener d
sir
i can not urg you too strongli to publish the result of your inquiri
i rememb perfectli that a few week befor the disappear of that
great singer christin daae and the tragedi which threw the whole of
the faubourg saintgermain into mourn there wa a great deal of
talk in the foyer of the ballet on the subject of the ghost and i
believ that it onli ceas to be discuss in consequ of the later
affair that excit us all so greatli but if it be possiblea
after hear you i believeto explain the tragedi through the ghost
then i beg you sir to talk to us about the ghost again
mysteri though the ghost mai at first appear he will alwai be more
easili explain than the dismal stori in which malevol peopl have
tri to pictur two brother kill each other who had worship each
other all their live
believ me etc
lastli with my bundl of paper in hand i onc more went over the
ghost vast domain the huge build which he had made hi kingdom
all that my ey saw all that my mind perceiv corrobor the
persian document precis and a wonder discoveri crown my
labor in a veri definit fashion it will be rememb that later
when dig in the substructur of the opera befor buri the
phonograph record of the artist voic the workmen laid bare a
corps well i wa at onc abl to prove that thi corps wa that of
the opera ghost i made the actingmanag put thi proof to the test
with hi own hand and it is now a matter of suprem indiffer to me
if the paper pretend that the bodi wa that of a victim of the commun
the wretch who were massacr under the commun in the cellar of
the opera were not buri on thi side i will tell where their
skeleton can be found in a spot not veri far from that immens crypt
which wa stock dure the sieg with all sort of provis i
came upon thi track just when i wa look for the remain of the
opera ghost which i should never have discov but for the
unheardof chanc describ abov

gaston leroux
chapter i is it the ghost
it wa the even on which mm debienn and poligni the manag of
the opera were give a last gala perform to mark their
retir suddenli the dressingroom of la sorelli on of the
princip dancer wa invad by halfadozen young ladi of the
ballet who had come up from the stage after danc polyeuct thei
rush in amid great confus some give vent to forc and
unnatur laughter other to cri of terror sorelli who wish to
be alon for a moment to run through the speech which she wa to make
to the resign manag look around angrili at the mad and
tumultu crowd it wa littl jammesth girl with the tiptilt
nose the forgetmenot ey the roser cheek and the lilywhit
neck and shoulderswho gave the explan in a trembl voic
it the ghost and she lock the door
sorelli dressingroom wa fit up with offici commonplac
eleg a pierglass a sofa a dressingt and a cupboard or two
provid the necessari furnitur on the wall hung a few engrav
relic of the mother who had known the glori of the old opera in the
rue le peleti portrait of vestri gardel dupont bigottini but
the room seem a palac to the brat of the corp de ballet who were
lodg in common dressingroom where thei spent their time sing
quarrel smack the dresser and hairdress and bui on
anoth glass of cassi beer or even rhum until the callboi
bell rang
sorelli wa veri superstiti she shudder when she heard littl
jamm speak of the ghost call her a silli littl fool and then
as she wa the first to believ in ghost in gener and the opera
ghost in particular at onc ask for detail
have you seen him
as plainli as i see you now said littl jamm whose leg were
give wai beneath her and she drop with a moan into a chair
thereupon littl giryth girl with ey black as sloe hair black as
ink a swarthi complexion and a poor littl skin stretch over poor
littl boneslittl giri ad
if that the ghost he veri ugli
oh ye cri the choru of balletgirl
and thei all began to talk togeth the ghost had appear to them in
the shape of a gentleman in dresscloth who had suddenli stood
befor them in the passag without their know where he came from
he seem to have come straight through the wall
pooh said on of them who had more or less kept her head you see
the ghost everywher
and it wa true for sever month there had been noth discuss
at the opera but thi ghost in dresscloth who stalk about the
build from top to bottom like a shadow who spoke to nobodi to
whom nobodi dare speak and who vanish as soon as he wa seen no on
know how or where as becam a real ghost he made no nois in
walk peopl began by laugh and make fun of thi specter
dress like a man of fashion or an undertak but the ghost legend
soon swell to enorm proport among the corp de ballet all
the girl pretend to have met thi supernatur be more or less
often and those who laugh the loudest were not the most at eas
when he did not show himself he betrai hi presenc or hi pass
by accid comic or seriou for which the gener superstit held
him respons had ani on met with a fall or suffer a practic
joke at the hand of on of the other girl or lost a powderpuff it
wa at onc the fault of the ghost of the opera ghost
after all who had seen him you meet so mani men in dresscloth at
the opera who ar not ghost but thi dresssuit had a peculiar of
it own it cover a skeleton at least so the balletgirl said
and of cours it had a death head
wa all thi seriou the truth is that the idea of the skeleton came
from the descript of the ghost given by joseph buquet the chief
sceneshift who had realli seen the ghost he had run up against
the ghost on the littl staircas by the footlight which lead to
the cellar he had seen him for a secondfor the ghost had
fledand to ani on who care to listen to him he said
he is extraordinarili thin and hi dresscoat hang on a skeleton
frame hi ey ar so deep that you can hardli see the fix pupil
you just see two big black hole as in a dead man skull hi skin
which is stretch across hi bone like a drumhead is not white but
a nasti yellow hi nose is so littl worth talk about that you
cant see it sidefac and the absenc of that nose is a horribl
thing to look at all the hair he ha is three or four long dark lock
on hi forehead and behind hi ear
thi chief sceneshift wa a seriou sober steadi man veri slow at
imagin thing hi word were receiv with interest and amaz
and soon there were other peopl to sai that thei too had met a man in
dresscloth with a death head on hi shoulder sensibl men who
had wind of the stori began by sai that joseph buquet had been the
victim of a joke plai by on of hi assist and then on after
the other there came a seri of incid so curiou and so
inexplic that the veri shrewdest peopl began to feel uneasi
for instanc a fireman is a brave fellow he fear noth least of
all fire well the fireman in question who had gone to make a round
of inspect in the cellar and who it seem had ventur a littl
farther than usual suddenli reappear on the stage pale scare
trembl with hi ey start out of hi head and practic
faint in the arm of the proud mother of littl jammes1 and why
becaus he had seen come toward him at the level of hi head but
without a bodi attach to it a head of fire and as i said a
fireman is not afraid of fire
the fireman name wa pampin
the corp de ballet wa flung into constern at first sight thi
fieri head in no wai correspond with joseph buquet descript of
the ghost but the young ladi soon persuad themselv that the
ghost had sever head which he chang about as he pleas and of
cours thei at onc imagin that thei were in the greatest danger
onc a fireman did not hesit to faint leader and frontrow and
backrow girl alik had plenti of excus for the fright that made
them quicken their pace when pass some dark corner or illlight
corridor sorelli herself on the dai after the adventur of the
fireman place a horsesho on the tabl in front of the
stagedoorkeep box which everi on who enter the opera
otherwis than as a spectat must touch befor set foot on the
first tread of the staircas thi horsesho wa not invent by
meani more than ani other part of thi stori alasand mai still be
seen on the tabl in the passag outsid the stagedoorkeep box
when you enter the opera through the court known as the cour de
ladministr
to return to the even in question
it the ghost littl jamm had cri
an agon silenc now reign in the dressingroom noth wa
heard but the hard breath of the girl at last jamm fling
herself upon the farthest corner of the wall with everi mark of real
terror on her face whisper
listen
everybodi seem to hear a rustl outsid the door there wa no
sound of footstep it wa like light silk slide over the panel
then it stop
sorelli tri to show more pluck than the other she went up to the
door and in a quaver voic ask
who there
but nobodi answer then feel all ey upon her watch her last
movement she made an effort to show courag and said veri loudli
is there ani on behind the door

chapter iii the mysteri reason
dure thi time the farewel ceremoni wa take place i have
alreadi said that thi magnific function wa be given on the
occas of the retir of m debienn and m poligni who had
determin to die game as we sai nowadai thei had been assist
in the realiz of their ideal though melancholi program by all
that count in the social and artist world of pari all these
peopl met after the perform in the foyer of the ballet where
sorelli wait for the arriv of the retir manag with a glass of
champagn in her hand and a littl prepar speech at the tip of her
tongu behind her the member of the corp de ballet young and old
discuss the event of the dai in whisper or exchang discreet
signal with their friend a noisi crowd of whom surround the
suppert arrang along the slant floor
a few of the dancer had alreadi chang into ordinari dress but most
of them wore their skirt of gossam gauz and all had thought it the
right thing to put on a special face for the occas all that is
except littl jamm whose fifteen summershappi ageseem alreadi
to have forgotten the ghost and the death of joseph buquet she never
ceas to laugh and chatter to hop about and plai practic joke
until mm debienn and poligni appear on the step of the foyer when
she wa sever call to order by the impati sorelli
everybodi remark that the retir manag look cheer as is
the pari wai none will ever be a true parisian who ha not learn
to wear a mask of gaieti over hi sorrow and on of sad boredom
or indiffer over hi inward joi you know that on of your friend
is in troubl do not try to consol him he will tell you that he is
alreadi comfort but should he have met with good fortun be
care how you congratul him he think it so natur that he is
surpris that you should speak of it in pari our live ar on
mask ball and the foyer of the ballet is the last place in which two
men so know as m debienn and m poligni would have made the
mistak of betrai their grief howev genuin it might be and
thei were alreadi smile rather too broadli upon sorelli who had
begun to recit her speech when an exclam from that littl madcap
of a jamm broke the smile of the manag so brutal that the
express of distress and dismai that lai beneath it becam appar
to all ey
the opera ghost
jamm yell these word in a tone of unspeak terror and her
finger point among the crowd of dandi to a face so pallid so
lugubri and so ugli with two such deep black caviti under the
straddl eyebrow that the death head in question immedi
score a huge success
the opera ghost the opera ghost everybodi laugh and push hi
neighbor and want to offer the opera ghost a drink but he wa gone
he had slip through the crowd and the other vainli hunt for him
while two old gentlemen tri to calm littl jamm and while littl
giri stood scream like a peacock
sorelli wa furiou she had not been abl to finish her speech the
manag had kiss her thank her and run awai as fast as the ghost
himself no on wa surpris at thi for it wa known that thei were
to go through the same ceremoni on the floor abov in the foyer of the
singer and that final thei were themselv to receiv their
person friend for the last time in the great lobbi outsid the
manag offic where a regular supper would be serv
here thei found the new manag m armand moncharmin and m firmin
richard whom thei hardli knew nevertheless thei were lavish in
protest of friendship and receiv a thousand flatter
compliment in repli so that those of the guest who had fear that
thei had a rather tediou even in store for them at onc put on
brighter face the supper wa almost gai and a particularli clever
speech of the repres of the govern mingl the glori of
the past with the success of the futur caus the greatest
cordial to prevail
the retir manag had alreadi hand over to their successor the
two tini masterkei which open all the doorsthousand of doorsof
the opera hous and those littl kei the object of gener
curios were be pass from hand to hand when the attent of
some of the guest wa divert by their discoveri at the end of the
tabl of that strang wan and fantast face with the hollow ey
which had alreadi appear in the foyer of the ballet and been greet
by littl jamm exclam
the opera ghost
there sat the ghost as natur as could be except that he neither at
nor drank those who began by look at him with a smile end by
turn awai their head for the sight of him at onc provok the
most funer thought no on repeat the joke of the foyer no on
exclaim
there the opera ghost
he himself did not speak a word and hi veri neighbor could not have
state at what precis moment he had sat down between them but everi
on felt that if the dead did ever come and sit at the tabl of the
live thei could not cut a more ghastli figur the friend of
firmin richard and armand moncharmin thought that thi lean and skinni
guest wa an acquaint of debienn or poligni while debienn
and poligni friend believ that the cadaver individu belong
to firmin richard and armand moncharmin parti
the result wa that no request wa made for an explan no
unpleas remark no joke in bad tast which might have offend thi
visitor from the tomb a few of those present who knew the stori of
the ghost and the descript of him given by the chief
sceneshifterthei did not know of joseph buquet deaththought in
their own mind that the man at the end of the tabl might easili have
pass for him and yet accord to the stori the ghost had no nose
and the person in question had but m moncharmin declar in hi
memoir that the guest nose wa transpar long thin and
transpar ar hi exact word i for my part will add that thi
might veri well appli to a fals nose m moncharmin mai have taken
for transpar what wa onli shini everybodi know that
orthopaed scienc provid beauti fals nose for those who have
lost their nose natur or as the result of an oper
did the ghost realli take a seat at the manag suppert that
night uninvit and can we be sure that the figur wa that of the
opera ghost himself who would ventur to assert as much i mention
the incid not becaus i wish for a second to make the reader
believeor even to try to make him believethat the ghost wa capabl
of such a sublim piec of impud but becaus after all the thing
is imposs
m armand moncharmin in chapter eleven of hi memoir sai
when i think of thi first even i can not separ the secret
confid to us by mm debienn and poligni in their offic from the
presenc at our supper of that ghostli person whom none of us knew
what happen wa thi mm debienn and poligni sit at the
center of the tabl had not seen the man with the death head
suddenli he began to speak
the balletgirl ar right he said the death of that poor buquet
is perhap not so natur as peopl think
debienn and poligni gave a start
is buquet dead thei cri
ye repli the man or the shadow of a man quietli he wa
found thi even hang in the third cellar between a farmhous
and a scene from the roi de lahor
the two manag or rather exmanag at onc rose and stare
strang at the speaker thei were more excit than thei need have
been that is to sai more excit than ani on need be by the
announc of the suicid of a chief sceneshift thei look at
each other thei had both turn whiter than the tablecloth at
last debienn made a sign to mm richard and moncharmin poligni
mutter a few word of excus to the guest and all four went into
the manag offic i leav m moncharmin to complet the stori in
hi memoir he sai
mm debienn and poligni seem to grow more and more excit and
thei appear to have someth veri difficult to tell us first thei
ask us if we knew the man sit at the end of the tabl who had
told them of the death of joseph buquet and when we answer in the
neg thei look still more concern thei took the masterkei
from our hand stare at them for a moment and advis us to have new
lock made with the greatest secreci for the room closet and
press that we might wish to have hermet close thei said thi
so funnili that we began to laugh and to ask if there were thiev at
the opera thei repli that there wa someth wors which wa the
ghost we began to laugh again feel sure that thei were indulg
in some joke that wa intend to crown our littl entertain
then at their request we becam seriou resolv to humor them
and to enter into the spirit of the game thei told us that thei never
would have spoken to us of the ghost if thei had not receiv formal
order from the ghost himself to ask us to be pleasant to him and to
grant ani request that he might make howev in their relief at
leav a domain where that tyrann shade held swai thei had
hesit until the last moment to tell us thi curiou stori which
our skeptic mind were certainli not prepar to entertain but the
announc of the death of joseph buquet had serv them as a brutal
remind that whenev thei had disregard the ghost wish some
fantast or disastr event had brought them to a sens of their
depend
dure these unexpect utter made in a tone of the most secret
and import confid i look at richard richard in hi student
dai had acquir a great reput for practic joke and he
seem to relish the dish which wa be serv up to him in hi turn
he did not miss a morsel of it though the season wa a littl
gruesom becaus of the death of buquet he nod hi head sadli
while the other spoke and hi featur assum the air of a man who
bitterli regret have taken over the opera now that he knew that
there wa a ghost mix up in the busi i could think of noth
better than to give him a servil imit of thi attitud of
despair howev in spite of all our effort we could not at the
finish help burst out laugh in the face of mm debienn and
poligni who see us pass straight from the gloomiest state of mind
to on of the most insol merriment act as though thei thought
that we had gone mad
the joke becam a littl tediou and richard ask halfseri and
half in jest
but after all what doe thi ghost of your want
m poligni went to hi desk and return with a copi of the
memorandumbook the memorandumbook begin with the wellknown word
sai that the manag of the opera shall give to the perform
of the nation academi of music the splendor that becom the first
lyric stage in franc and end with claus 98 which sai that the
privileg can be withdrawn if the manag infring the condit
stipul in the memorandumbook thi is follow by the condit
which ar four in number
the copi produc by m poligni wa written in black ink and exactli
similar to that in our possess except that at the end it
contain a paragraph in red ink and in a queer labor handwrit
as though it had been produc by dip the head of match into the
ink the write of a child that ha never got beyond the downstrok
and ha not learn to join it letter thi paragraph ran word for
word as follow
5 or if the manag in ani month delai for more than a fortnight
the payment of the allow which he shall make to the opera ghost an
allow of twenti thousand franc a month sai two hundr and forti
thousand franc a year
m poligni point with a hesit finger to thi last claus which
we certainli did not expect
is thi all doe he not want anyth els ask richard with
the greatest cool
ye he doe repli poligni
and he turn over the page of the memorandumbook until he came to
the claus specifi the dai on which certain privat box were to
be reserv for the free us of the presid of the republ the
minist and so on at the end of thi claus a line had been ad
also in red ink
box five on the grand tier shall be place at the dispos of the
opera ghost for everi perform
when we saw thi there wa noth els for us to do but to rise from
our chair shake our two predecessor warmli by the hand and
congratul them on think of thi charm littl joke which
prove that the old french sens of humor wa never like to becom
extinct richard ad that he now understood why mm debienn and
poligni were retir from the manag of the nation academi of
music busi wa imposs with so unreason a ghost
certainli two hundr and forti thousand franc ar not be pick up
for the ask said m poligni without move a muscl of hi face
and have you consid what the loss over box five meant to us we
did not sell it onc and not onli that but we had to return the
subscript why it aw we realli cant work to keep ghost
we prefer to go awai
ye echo m debienn we prefer to go awai let us go
and he stood up richard said but after all all it seem to me
that you were much too kind to the ghost if i had such a troublesom
ghost as that i should not hesit to have him arrest
but how where thei cri in choru we have never seen him
but when he come to hi box

number of success piec of all kind and who like nearli everi
form of music and everi sort of musician clearli therefor it wa
the duti of everi sort of musician to like m firmin richard the onli
thing to be said against him were that he wa rather master in hi
wai and endow with a veri hasti temper
the first few dai which the partner spent at the opera were given

chapter v the enchant violin
christin daae ow to intrigu to which i will return later did
not immedi continu her triumph at the opera after the famou
gala night she sang onc at the duchess de zurich but thi wa the
last occas on which she wa heard in privat she refus without
plausibl excus to appear at a chariti concert to which she had
promis her assist she act throughout as though she were no
longer the mistress of her own destini and as though she fear a fresh
triumph
she knew that the comt de chagni to pleas hi brother had done hi
best on her behalf with m richard and she wrote to thank him and also
to ask him to ceas speak in her favor her reason for thi curiou
attitud wa never known some pretend that it wa due to
overween pride other spoke of her heavenli modesti but peopl on
the stage ar not so modest as all that and i think that i shall not
be far from the truth if i ascrib her action simpli to fear ye i
believ that christin daae wa frighten by what had happen to her
i have a letter of christin it form part of the persian
collect relat to thi period which suggest a feel of
absolut dismai
i dont know myself when i sing write the poor child
she show herself nowher and the vicomt de chagni tri in vain to
meet her he wrote to her ask to call upon her but despair of
receiv a repli when on morn she sent him the follow note
monsieur

littl church at the bottom of the slope where we us to plai as
children besid the road where when we were a littl bigger we said
goodbi for the last time
the vicomt de chagni hurriedli consult a railwai guid dress as
quickli as he could wrote a few line for hi valet to take to hi
brother and jump into a cab which brought him to the gare
montparnass just in time to miss the morn train he spent a dismal
dai in town and did not recov hi spirit until the even when he
wa seat in hi compart in the brittani express he read
christin note over and over again smell it perfum recal
the sweet pictur of hi childhood and spent the rest of that tediou
night journei in feverish dream that began and end with christin
daae dai wa break when he alight at lannion he hurri to the
dilig for perrosguirec he wa the onli passeng he question
the driver and learn that on the even of the previou dai a
young ladi who look like a parisian had gone to perro and put up at
the inn known as the set sun
the nearer he drew to her the more fondli he rememb the stori of
the littl swedish singer most of the detail ar still unknown to
the public
there wa onc in a littl markettown not far from upsala a peasant
who live there with hi famili dig the earth dure the week and
sing in the choir on sundai thi peasant had a littl daughter to
whom he taught the music alphabet befor she knew how to read
daae father wa a great musician perhap without know it not a
fiddler throughout the length and breadth of scandinavia plai as he
did hi reput wa widespread and he wa alwai invit to set
the coupl danc at wed and other festiv hi wife di
when christin wa enter upon her sixth year then the father who
care onli for hi daughter and hi music sold hi patch of ground and
went to upsala in search of fame and fortun he found noth but
poverti
he return to the countri wander from fair to fair strum hi
scandinavian melodi while hi child who never left hi side
listen to him in ecstasi or sang to hi plai on dai at ljimbi
fair professor valeriu heard them and took them to gothenburg he
maintain that the father wa the first violinist in the world and
that the daughter had the make of a great artist her educ and
instruct were provid for she made rapid progress and charm
everybodi with her pretti her grace of manner and her genuin
eager to pleas
when valeriu and hi wife went to settl in franc thei took daae and
christin with them mamma valeriu treat christin as her
daughter as for daae he began to pine awai with homesick he
never went out of door in pari but live in a sort of dream which he
kept up with hi violin for hour at a time he remain lock up in
hi bedroom with hi daughter fiddl and sing veri veri softli
sometim mamma valeriu would come and listen behind the door wipe
awai a tear and go downstair again on tipto sigh for her
scandinavian ski
daae seem not to recov hi strength until the summer when the
whole famili went to stai at perrosguirec in a farawai corner of
brittani where the sea wa of the same color as in hi own countri
often he would plai hi saddest tune on the beach and pretend that the
sea stop it roar to listen to them and then he induc mamma
valeriu to indulg a queer whim of hi at the time of the pardon
or breton pilgrimag the villag festiv and danc he went off
with hi fiddl as in the old dai and wa allow to take hi
daughter with him for a week thei gave the smallest hamlet music to
last them for a year and slept at night in a barn refus a bed at
the inn ly close togeth on the straw as when thei were so poor
in sweden at the same time thei were veri neatli dress made no
collect refus the halfpenc offer them and the peopl around
could not understand the conduct of thi rustic fiddler who tramp
the road with that pretti child who sang like an angel from heaven
thei follow them from villag to villag
on dai a littl boi who wa out with hi gover made her take a
longer walk than he intend for he could not tear himself from the
littl girl whose pure sweet voic seem to bind him to her thei
came to the shore of an inlet which is still call trestraou but
which now i believ harbor a casino or someth of the sort at
that time there wa noth but sky and sea and a stretch of golden
beach onli there wa also a high wind which blew christin scarf
out to sea christin gave a cry and put out her arm but the scarf
wa alreadi far on the wave then she heard a voic sai
it all right ill go and fetch your scarf out of the sea
and she saw a littl boi run fast in spite of the outcri and the
indign protest of a worthi ladi in black the littl boi ran into
the sea dress as he wa and brought her back her scarf boi and
scarf were both soak through the ladi in black made a great fuss
but christin laugh merrili and kiss the littl boi who wa none
other than the vicomt raoul de chagni stai at lannion with hi
aunt
dure the season thei saw each other and plai togeth almost everi
dai at the aunt request second by professor valeriu daae
consent to give the young viscount some violin lesson in thi wai
raoul learn to love the same air that had charm christin
childhood thei also both had the same calm and dreami littl cast of
mind thei delight in stori in old breton legend and their
favorit sport wa to go and ask for them at the cottagedoor like
beggar
maam or kind gentleman have you a littl stori to tell us
pleas
and it seldom happen that thei did not have on given them for
nearli everi old breton grandam ha at least onc in her life seen
the korrigan danc by moonlight on the heather
but their great treat wa in the twilight in the great silenc of the
even after the sun had set in the sea when daae came and sat down
by them on the roadsid and in a low voic as though fear lest he
should frighten the ghost whom he evok told them the legend of the
land of the north and the moment he stop the children would ask
for more
there wa on stori that began
a king sat in a littl boat on on of those deep still lake that
open like a bright ey in the midst of the norwegian mountain
and anoth
littl lott thought of everyth and noth her hair wa golden
as the sun rai and her soul as clear and blue as her ey she
wheedl her mother wa kind to her doll took great care of her frock
and her littl red shoe and her fiddl but most of all love when
she went to sleep to hear the angel of music
while the old man told thi stori raoul look at christin blue
ey and golden hair and christin thought that lott wa veri lucki
to hear the angel of music when she went to sleep the angel of music
plai a part in all daddi daae tale and he maintain that everi
great musician everi great artist receiv a visit from the angel at
least onc in hi life sometim the angel lean over their cradl
as happen to lott and that is how there ar littl prodigi who
plai the fiddl at six better than men at fifti which you must admit
is veri wonder sometim the angel come much later becaus the
children ar naughti and wont learn their lesson or practis their
scale and sometim he doe not come at all becaus the children
have a bad heart or a bad conscienc
no on ever see the angel but he is heard by those who ar meant to
hear him he often come when thei least expect him when thei ar sad
and dishearten then their ear suddenli perceiv celesti
harmoni a divin voic which thei rememb all their live
person who ar visit by the angel quiver with a thrill unknown to
the rest of mankind and thei can not touch an instrument or open
their mouth to sing without produc sound that put all other human
sound to shame then peopl who do not know that the angel ha
visit those person sai that thei have geniu
littl christin ask her father if he had heard the angel of music
but daddi daae shook hi head sadli and then hi ey lit up as he
said
you will hear him on dai my child when i am in heaven i will send
him to you
daddi wa begin to cough at that time
three year later raoul and christin met again at perro professor
valeriu wa dead but hi widow remain in franc with daddi daae and
hi daughter who continu to plai the violin and sing wrap in
their dream of harmoni their kind patro who seem henceforth to
live on music alon the young man as he now wa had come to perro
on the chanc of find them and went straight to the hous in which
thei us to stai he first saw the old man and then christin
enter carri the teatrai she flush at the sight of raoul who
went up to her and kiss her she ask him a few question
perform her duti as hostess prettili took up the trai again and
left the room then she ran into the garden and took refug on a
bench a prei to feel that stir her young heart for the first
time raoul follow her and thei talk till the even veri shyli
thei were quit chang cautiou as two diplomatist and told each
other thing that had noth to do with their bud sentiment
when thei took leav of each other by the roadsid raoul press a
kiss on christin trembl hand said
mademoisel i shall never forget you
and he went awai regret hi word for he knew that christin could
not be the wife of the vicomt de chagni
as for christin she tri not to think of him and devot herself
wholli to her art she made wonder progress and those who heard her
prophesi that she would be the greatest singer in the world
meanwhil the father di and suddenli she seem to have lost
with him her voic her soul and her geniu she retain just but
onli just enough of thi to enter the conservatoir where she did not
distinguish herself at all attend the class without enthusiasm
and take a prize onli to pleas old mamma valeriu with whom she
continu to live
the first time that raoul saw christin at the opera he wa charm by
the girl beauti and by the sweet imag of the past which it evok
but wa rather surpris at the neg side of her art he return
to listen to her he follow her in the wing he wait for her
behind a jacob ladder he tri to attract her attent more than
onc he walk after her to the door of her box but she did not see
him she seem for that matter to see nobodi she wa all
indiffer raoul suffer for she wa veri beauti and he wa
shy and dare not confess hi love even to himself and then came the
lightningflash of the gala perform the heaven torn asund and
an angel voic heard upon earth for the delight of mankind and the
utter captur of hi heart
and then and then there wa that man voic behind the dooryou
must love meand no on in the room
why did she laugh when he remind her of the incid of the scarf
why did she not recogn him and why had she written to him
perro wa reach at last raoul walk into the smoki sittingroom
of the set sun and at onc saw christin stand befor him
smile and show no astonish
so you have come she said i felt that i should find you here
when i came back from mass some on told me so at the church
who ask raoul take her littl hand in hi
why my poor father who is dead

the tone of these question wa so rough that christin stare at raoul
without repli the young man himself wa aghast at the sudden
quarrel which he had dare to rais at the veri moment when he had
resolv to speak word of gentl love and submiss to
christin a husband a lover with all right would talk no

memori in common he heard that she had had a mass said that
morn for the repos of her father soul and spent a long time

enter the church but i wa quicker than the shadow and caught hold
of a corner of it cloak at that moment we were just in front of the
high altar and the moonbeam fell straight upon us through the
stainedglass window of the aps as i did not let go of the cloak
the shadow turn round and i saw a terribl death head which
dart a look at me from a pair of scorch ey i felt as if i were
face to face with satan and in the presenc of thi unearthli
apparit my heart gave wai my courag fail me and i rememb

surround them it wa the time when most of the stagehand go out
for a drink the staff had left the board for the moment leav a

look like an angri sea whose glaucou wave had been suddenli
render stationari by a secret order from the storm phantom who as
everybodi know is call adamastor mm moncharmin and richard were
the shipwreck marin amid thi motionless turmoil of a calico sea
thei made for the left box plow their wai like sailor who leav
their ship and try to struggl to the shore the eight great polish
column stood up in the dusk like so mani huge pile support the
threaten crumbl bigbelli cliff whose layer were
repres by the circular parallel wave line of the balconi of
the grand first and second tier of box at the top right on top

doubt end by blind my imagin and also my visual faculti
it mai be that the except surround in which we found
ourselv in the midst of an incred silenc impress us to an
unusu extent it mai be that we were the sport of a kind of
hallucin brought about by the semidark of the theater and the
partial gloom that fill box five at ani rate i saw and richard
also saw a shape in the box richard said noth nor i either but
we spontan seiz each other hand we stood like that for some
minut without move with our ey fix on the same point but the
figur had disappear then we went out and in the lobbi
commun our impress to each other and talk about the
shape the misfortun wa that my shape wa not in the least like
richard i had seen a thing like a death head rest on the ledg
of the box wherea richard saw the shape of an old woman who look
like mme giri we soon discov that we had realli been the victim
of an illus whereupon without further delai and laugh like
madmen we ran to box five on the grand tier went insid and found no

understood and the opera rang with her indign yell her violent
protest and threat
about the same time carlotta who had a small hous of her own in the
rue du faubourg st honor rang for her maid who brought her letter
to her bed among them wa an anonym missiv written in red ink
in a hesit clumsi hand which ran
if you appear tonight you must be prepar for a great misfortun at
the moment when you open your mouth to sing a misfortun wors than
death
the letter took awai carlotta appetit for breakfast she push
back her chocol sat up in bed and thought hard it wa not the
first letter of the kind which she had receiv but she never had on
couch in such threaten term
she thought herself at that time the victim of a thousand jealou
attempt and went about sai that she had a secret enemi who had
sworn to ruin her she pretend that a wick plot wa be hatch
against her a cabal which would come to a head on of those dai but
she ad that she wa not the woman to be intimid
the truth is that if there wa a cabal it wa led by carlotta herself
against poor christin who had no suspicion of it carlotta had never
forgiven christin for the triumph which she had achiev when take
her place at a moment notic when carlotta heard of the astound
recept bestow upon her understudi she wa at onc cure of an
incipi attack of bronchiti and a bad fit of sulk against the
manag and lost the slightest inclin to shirk her duti
from that time she work with all her might to smother her rival
enlist the servic of influenti friend to persuad the manag
not to give christin an opportun for a fresh triumph certain
newspap which had begun to extol the talent of christin now
interest themselv onli in the fame of carlotta lastli in the
theater itself the celebr but heartless and soulless diva made
the most scandal remark about christin and tri to caus her
endless minor unpleas
when carlotta had finish think over the threat contain in the

that she wa run the most seriou danger that even she
collect all her support told them that she wa threaten at that
even perform with a plot organ by christin daae and
declar that thei must plai a trick upon that chit by fill the
hous with her carlotta admir she had no lack of them had
she she reli upon them to hold themselv prepar for ani
eventu and to silenc the adversari if as she fear thei
creat a disturb
m richard privat secretari call to ask after the diva health
and return with the assur that she wa perfectli well and that
were she dy she would sing the part of margarita that even
the secretari urg her in hi chief name to commit no imprud
to stai at home all dai and to be care of draft and carlotta could
not help after he had gone compar thi unusu and unexpect
advic with the threat contain in the letter
it wa five oclock when the post brought a second anonym letter in
the same hand as the first it wa short and said simpli
you have a bad cold if you ar wise you will see that it is mad
to try to sing tonight
carlotta sneer shrug her handsom shoulder and sang two or three
note to reassur herself
her friend were faith to their promis thei were all at the opera
that night but look round in vain for the fierc conspir whom
thei were instruct to suppress the onli unusu thing wa the
presenc of m richard and m moncharmin in box five carlotta

supposit as the reader know m richard and m moncharmin were
think of noth but their ghost
vain in vain do i call through my vigil weari on creation and it
lord never repli will break the silenc dreari no sign no singl
word
the famou bariton carolu fonta had hardli finish doctor faust
first appeal to the power of dark when m firmin richard who wa
sit in the ghost own chair the front chair on the right lean
over to hi partner and ask him chaffingli
well ha the ghost whisper a word in your ear yet
wait dont be in such a hurri repli m armand moncharmin in the
same gai tone the perform ha onli begun and you know that the
ghost doe not usual come until the middl of the first act
the first act pass without incid which did not surpris
carlotta friend becaus margarita doe not sing in thi act as
for the manag thei look at each other when the curtain fell
that on said moncharmin
ye the ghost is late said firmin richard
it not a bad hous said moncharmin for a hous with a curs on

persuad hi concierg in whom he had the greatest confid to

that woman instead of the old lunat box five would continu to
astonish the nativ
by the wai said moncharmin you know that mother giri is go to
lodg a complaint against you

the ghost moncharmin had almost forgotten him howev that
mysteri person did noth to bring himself to the memori of the

time when the door of the box suddenli open to admit the startl
stagemanag
what the matter thei both ask amaz at see him there at
such a time
it seem there a plot got up by christin daae friend against

the stage rang with gai song
red or white liquor
coars or fine
what can it matter
so we have wine
student citizen soldier girl and matron whirl lightheartedli
befor the inn with the figur of bacchu for a sign siebel made her
entranc christin daae look charm in her boi cloth and
carlotta partisan expect to hear her greet with an ovat which
would have enlighten them as to the intent of her friend but

on the other hand when margarita cross the stage and sang the onli
two line allot her in thi second act
no my lord not a ladi am i nor yet a beauti
and do not need an arm to help me on my wai
carlotta wa receiv with enthusiast applaus it wa so unexpect
and so uncal for that those who knew noth about the rumor look
at on anoth and ask what wa happen and thi act also wa
finish without incid
then everybodi said of cours it will be dure the next act
some who seem to be better inform than the rest declar that the
row would begin with the ballad of the king of thule and rush to
the subscrib entranc to warn carlotta the manag left the box
dure the entract to find out more about the cabal of which the
stagemanag had spoken but thei soon return to their seat
shrug their shoulder and treat the whole affair as silli
the first thing thei saw on enter the box wa a box of english
sweet on the littl shelf of the ledg who had put it there thei
ask the boxkeep but none of them knew then thei went back to
the shelf and next to the box of sweet found an opera glass thei

giri had told them return to their memori and then and then
thei seem to feel a curiou sort of draft around them thei
sat down in silenc

as she sang these first two line with her bunch of rose and lilac
in her hand christin rais her head saw the vicomt de chagni in
hi box and from that moment her voic seem less sure less
crystalclear than usual someth seem to deaden and dull her

there wa constern on carlotta face and constern on the
face of all the audienc the two manag in their box could not
suppress an exclam of horror everi on felt that the thing wa
not natur that there wa witchcraft behind it that toad smelt of
brimston poor wretch despair crush carlotta
the uproar in the hous wa indescrib if the thing had happen
to ani on but carlotta she would have been hoot but everybodi
knew how perfect an instrument her voic wa and there wa no displai
of anger but onli of horror and dismai the sort of dismai which men
would have felt if thei had wit the catastroph that broke the
arm of the venu de milo and even then thei would have seen
and understood
but here that toad wa incomprehens so much so that after some
second spent in ask herself if she had realli heard that note that
sound that infern nois issu from her throat she tri to persuad
herself that it wa not so that she wa the victim of an illus an
illus of the ear and not of an act of treacheri on the part of her
voic
meanwhil in box five moncharmin and richard had turn veri pale
thi extraordinari and inexplic incid fill them with a dread
which wa the more mysteri inasmuch as for some littl while thei

breath moncharmin hair stood on end richard wipe the
perspir from hi forehead ye the ghost wa there around them
behind them besid them thei felt hi presenc without see him
thei heard hi breath close close close to them thei were sure
that there were three peopl in the box thei trembl thei
thought of run awai thei dare not thei dare not make a

abomin thought or a prei to some persist sport of fate
the fall of the chandeli had involv them in no littl
respons but it wa difficult to make them speak about it the

christin enter took off her mask with a weari movement and flung it
on the tabl she sigh and let her pretti head fall into her two
hand what wa she think of of raoul no for raoul heard her
murmur poor erik
at first he thought he must be mistaken to begin with he wa
persuad that if ani on wa to be piti it wa he raoul it
would have been quit natur if she had said poor raoul after what

erik
what had thi erik to do with christin sigh and why wa she piti

the voic without a bodi went on sing and certainli raoul had never
in hi life heard anyth more absolut and heroic sweet more
glorious insidi more delic more power in short more
irresist triumphant he listen to it in a fever and he now began
to understand how christin daae wa abl to appear on even befor
the stupefi audienc with accent of a beauti hitherto unknown of a
superhuman exalt while doubtless still under the influenc of the
mysteri and invis master
the voic wa sing the weddingnight song from romeo and juliet
raoul saw christin stretch out her arm to the voic as she had done
in perro churchyard to the invis violin plai the resurrect
of lazaru and noth could describ the passion with which the
voic sang
fate link thee to me for ever and a dai
the strain went through raoul heart struggl against the charm
that seem to depriv him of all hi will and all hi energi and of
almost all hi lucid at the moment when he need them most he
succeed in draw back the curtain that hid him and he walk to
where christin stood she herself wa move to the back of the room
the whole wall of which wa occupi by a great mirror that reflect

christin walk toward her imag in the glass and the imag came
toward her the two christinesth real on and the reflectionend
by touch and raoul put out hi arm to clasp the two in on
embrac but by a sort of dazzl miracl that sent him stagger
raoul wa suddenli flung back while an ici blast swept over hi face
he saw not two but four eight twenti christin spin round him
laugh at him and flee so swiftli that he could not touch on of
them at last everyth stood still again and he saw himself in the
glass but christin had disappear

the voic outsid my room wherea it went on steadili insid and it
not onli sang but it spoke to me and answer my question like a
real man voic with thi differ that it wa as beauti as the
voic of an angel i had never got the angel of music whom my poor
father had promis to send me as soon as he wa dead i realli think
that mamma valeriu wa a littl bit to blame i told her about it
and she at onc said it must be the angel at ani rate you can do no
harm by ask him i did so and the man voic repli that ye
it wa the angel voic the voic which i wa expect and which my
father had promis me from that time onward the voic and i becam
great friend it ask leav to give me lesson everi dai i agre
and never fail to keep the appoint which it gave me in my
dressingroom you have no idea though you have heard the voic of
what those lesson were like
no i have no idea said raoul what wa your accompani
we were accompani by a music which i do not know it wa behind the
wall and wonderfulli accur the voic seem to understand mine
exactli to know precis where my father had left off teach me
in a few week time i hardli knew myself when i sang i wa even
frighten i seem to dread a sort of witchcraft behind it but
mamma valeriu reassur me she said that she knew i wa much too
simpl a girl to give the devil a hold on me my progress by the
voic own order wa kept a secret between the voic mamma valeriu
and myself it wa a curiou thing but outsid the dressingroom i
sang with my ordinari everydai voic and nobodi notic anyth i
did all that the voic ask it said wait and see we shall
astonish pari and i wait and live on in a sort of ecstat dream
it wa then that i saw you for the first time on even in the
hous i wa so glad that i never thought of conceal my delight
when i reach my dressingroom unfortun the voic wa there
befor me and soon notic by my air that someth had happen it
ask what wa the matter and i saw no reason for keep our stori
secret or conceal the place which you fill in my heart then the
voic wa silent i call to it but it did not repli i beg and
entreat but in vain i wa terrifi lest it had gone for good i
wish to heaven it had dear that night i went home in a
desper condit i told mamma valeriu who said why of cours
the voic is jealou and that dear first reveal to me that i
love you
christin stop and laid her head on raoul shoulder thei sat like
that for a moment in silenc and thei did not see did not perceiv
the movement at a few step from them of the creep shadow of two
great black wing a shadow that came along the roof so near so near
them that it could have stifl them by close over them
the next dai christin continu with a sigh i went back to my
dressingroom in a veri pensiv frame of mind the voic wa there
spoke to me with great sad and told me plainli that if i must
bestow my heart on earth there wa noth for the voic to do but to
go back to heaven and it said thi with such an accent of human
sorrow that i ought then and there to have suspect and begun to
believ that i wa the victim of my delud sens but my faith in
the voic with which the memori of my father wa so close
intermingl remain undisturb i fear noth so much as that i
might never hear it again i had thought about my love for you and
realiz all the useless danger of it and i did not even know if you
rememb me whatev happen your posit in societi forbad me
to contempl the possibl of ever marri you and i swore to the
voic that you were no more than a brother to me nor ever would be and
that my heart wa incap of ani earthli love and that dear wa
why i refus to recogn or see you when i met you on the stage or in
the passag meanwhil the hour dure which the voic taught me
were spent in a divin frenzi until at last the voic said to me

heaven i dont know how it wa that carlotta did not come to the
theater that night nor why i wa call upon to sing in her stead but
i sang with a raptur i had never known befor and i felt for a moment
as if my soul were leav my bodi

accent of your voic i saw the tear stream down your cheek and i
wept with you how could you sing sing like that while cry
i felt myself faint said christin i close my ey when i

began to laugh when you remind me that you had pick up my scarf in
the sea ala there is no deceiv the voic the voic

not love you i would not avoid you but treat you like ani other old
friend it made me scene upon scene at last i said to the voic

chandeli mai have come down upon the voic i wa then on the stage
and wa nearli run into the hous to look for the voic among the
kill and wound when i thought that if the voic wa safe it
would be sure to be in my dressingroom and i rush to my room the
voic wa not there i lock my door and with tear in my ey
besought it if it were still aliv to manifest itself to me the
voic did not repli but suddenli i heard a long beauti wail which
i knew well it is the plaint of lazaru when at the sound of the
redeem voic he begin to open hi ey and see the light of dai
it wa the music which you and i raoul heard at perro and then the
voic began to sing the lead phrase come and believ in me
whoso believ in me shall live walk whoso hath believ in me
shall never die i can not tell you the effect which that music

call upon the voic to help me for i should never have imagin that

ghost have you not raoul
ye but tell me what happen when you were on the white hors of the
profeta

i made no effort to escap a curiou feel of peac came
over me and i thought that i must be under the influenc of some
cordial i had the full command of my sens and my ey becam us
to the dark which wa lit here and there by fit gleam i
calcul that we were in a narrow circular galleri probabl run
all round the opera which is immens underground i had onc been
down into those cellar but had stop at the third floor though
there were two lower still larg enough to hold a town but the
figur of which i caught sight had made me run awai there ar demon
down there quit black stand in front of boiler and thei wield
shovel and pitchfork and poke up fire and stir up flame and if you
come too near them thei frighten you by suddenli open the red
mouth of their furnac well while cesar wa quietli carri me
on hi back i saw those black demon in the distanc look quit
small in front of the red fire of their furnac thei came into
sight disappear and came into sight again as we went on our wind
wai at last thei disappear altogeth the shape wa still
hold me up and cesar walk on unl and surefoot i could not
tell you even approxim how long thi ride last i onli know
that we seem to turn and turn and often went down a spiral stair into
the veri heart of the earth even then it mai be that my head wa
turn but i dont think so no my mind wa quit clear at last
cesar rais hi nostril snif the air and quicken hi pace a
littl i felt a moist in the air and cesar stop the dark
had lift a sort of bluei light surround us we were on the edg
of a lake whose leaden water stretch into the distanc into the
dark but the blue light lit up the bank and i saw a littl boat
fasten to an iron ring on the wharf
a boat
ye but i knew that all that exist and that there wa noth
supernatur about that underground lake and boat but think of the
except condit in which i arriv upon that shore i dont
know whether the effect of the cordial had worn off when the man
shape lift me into the boat but my terror began all over again my
gruesom escort must have notic it for he sent cesar back and i
heard hi hoof trampl up a staircas while the man jump into the
boat unti the rope that held it and seiz the oar he row with
a quick power stroke and hi ey under the mask never left me
we slip across the noiseless water in the bluei light which i told
you of then we were in the dark again and we touch shore and i wa
onc more taken up in the man arm i cri aloud and then
suddenli i wa silent daze by the light ye a dazzl light in
the midst of which i had been put down i sprang to my feet i wa in
the middl of a drawingroom that seem to me to be decor adorn
and furnish with noth but flower flower both magnific and
stupid becaus of the silk ribbon that ti them to basket like
those which thei sell in the shop on the boulevard thei were much
too civil flower like those which i us to find in my
dressingroom after a first night and in the midst of all these
flower stood the black shape of the man in the mask with arm
cross and he said dont be afraid christin you ar in no
danger it wa the voic
my anger equal my amaz i rush at the mask and tri to
snatch it awai so as to see the face of the voic the man said you

gentli by the wrist he forc me into a chair and then went down on
hi knee befor me and said noth more hi humil gave me back

said blood blood here there more blood that a
good thing a ghost who bleed is less danger he grin
raoul raoul raoul
the count wa shake him as though he were try to waken a
sleepwalk
but my dear brother im not asleep raoul protest impati
you can see the blood for yourself i thought i had been dream and
fire at two star it wa erik ey and here is hi blood
after all perhap i wa wrong to shoot and christin is quit capabl
of never forgiv me all thi would not have happen if i had
drawn the curtain befor go to bed
raoul have you suddenli gone mad wake up
what still you would do better to help me find erik for after

the count valet said
that is so sir there is blood on the balconi
the other manserv brought a lamp by the light of which thei
examin the balconi carefulli the mark of blood follow the rail
till thei reach a gutterspout then thei went up the gutterspout
my dear fellow said count philipp you have fire at a cat
the misfortun is said raoul with a grin that it quit
possibl with erik you never know is it erik is it the cat is
it the ghost no with erik you cant tell
raoul went on make thi strang sort of remark which correspond so
intim and logic with the preoccup of hi brain and which
at the same time tend to persuad mani peopl that hi mind wa
unhing the count himself wa seiz with thi idea and later the
examin magistr on receiv the report of the commissari of
polic came to the same conclus
who is erik ask the count press hi brother hand
he is my rival and if he not dead it a piti
he dismiss the servant with a wave of the hand and the two chagni
were left alon but the men were not out of earshot befor the
count valet heard raoul sai distinctli and emphat
i shall carri off christin daae tonight
thi phrase wa afterward repeat to m faur the
examiningmagistr but no on ever knew exactli what pass between
the two brother at thi interview the servant declar that thi
wa not their first quarrel their voic penetr the wall and it
wa alwai an actress call christin daae that wa in question
at breakfastth earli morn breakfast which the count took in hi
studyphilipp sent for hi brother raoul arriv silent and gloomi
the scene wa a veri short on philipp hand hi brother a copi of
the epoqu and said
read that
the viscount read
the latest new in the faubourg is that there is a promis of marriag
between mlle christin daae the operasing and m le vicomt raoul
de chagni if the gossip ar to be credit count philipp ha sworn
that for the first time on record the chagni shall not keep their
promis but as love is allpow at the opera asand even more
thanelsewher we wonder how count philipp intend to prevent the
viscount hi brother from lead the new margarita to the altar
the two brother ar said to ador each other but the count is
curious mistaken if he imagin that brotherli love will triumph over
love pure and simpl
you see raoul said the count you ar make us ridicul that
littl girl ha turn your head with her ghoststori
the viscount had evid repeat christin narr to hi
brother dure the night all that he now said wa
goodbi philipp
have you quit made up your mind you ar go tonight with her
no repli
sure you will not do anyth so foolish i shall know how to
prevent you
goodbi philipp said the viscount again and left the room
thi scene wa describ to the examiningmagistr by the count
himself who did not see raoul again until that even at the opera
a few minut befor christin disappear
raoul in fact devot the whole dai to hi prepar for the
flight the hors the carriag the coachman the provis the
luggag the monei requir for the journei the road to be taken he
had resolv not to go by train so as to throw the ghost off the
scent all thi had to be settl and provid for and it occupi
him until nine oclock at night
at nine oclock a sort of travelingbarouch with the curtain of it
window closedown took it place in the rank on the rotunda side it
wa drawn by two power hors driven by a coachman whose face wa
almost conceal in the long fold of a muffler in front of thi
travelingcarriag were three brougham belong respect to
carlotta who had suddenli return to pari to sorelli and at the
head of the rank to comt philipp de chagni no on left the
barouch the coachman remain on hi box and the three other
coachmen remain on their
a shadow in a long black cloak and a soft black felt hat pass along
the pavement between the rotunda and the carriag examin the
barouch carefulli went up to the hors and the coachman and then
move awai without sai a word the magistr afterward believ
that thi shadow wa that of the vicomt raoul de chagni but i do not
agre see that that even as everi even the vicomt de
chagni wa wear a tall hat which hat besid wa subsequ
found i am more inclin to think that the shadow wa that of the
ghost who knew all about the whole affair as the reader will soon
perceiv
thei were give faust as it happen befor a splendid hous the
faubourg wa magnific repres and the paragraph in that
morn epoqu had alreadi produc it effect for all ey were
turn to the box in which count philipp sat alon appar in a
veri indiffer and careless frame of mind the feminin element in
the brilliant audienc seem curious puzzl and the viscount
absenc gave rise to ani amount of whisper behind the fan
christin daae met with a rather cold recept that special audienc
could not forgiv her for aim so high
the singer notic thi unfavor attitud of a portion of the hous
and wa confus by it
the regular frequent of the opera who pretend to know the truth
about the viscount lovestori exchang signific smile at
certain passag in margarita part and thei made a show of turn
and look at philipp de chagni box when christin sang
i wish i could but know who wa he
that address me
if he wa nobl or at least what hi name is
the count sat with hi chin on hi hand and seem to pai no attent
to these manifest he kept hi ey fix on the stage but hi
thought appear to be far awai
christin lost her selfassur more and more she trembl she
felt on the verg of a breakdown carolu fonta wonder if she wa
ill if she could keep the stage until the end of the garden act in
the front of the hous peopl rememb the catastroph that had
befallen carlotta at the end of that act and the histor coack
which had momentarili interrupt her career in pari
just then carlotta made her entranc in a box face the stage a
sensat entranc poor christin rais her ey upon thi fresh
subject of excit she recogn her rival she thought she saw
a sneer on her lip that save her she forgot everyth in order
to triumph onc more
from that moment the prima donna sang with all her heart and soul she
tri to surpass all that she had done till then and she succeed
in the last act when she began the invoc to the angel she made
all the member of the audienc feel as though thei too had wing
in the center of the amphitheat a man stood up and remain stand
face the singer it wa raoul
holi angel in heaven bless
and christin her arm outstretch her throat fill with music the

instant the perform wa interrupt amid the greatest disord
where had christin gone what witchcraft had snatch her awai
befor the ey of thousand of enthusiast onlook and from the

pink and chubbycheek crown with curli hair and lit up by a pair
of wonderfulli seren blue ey mercier the actingmanag call

erik secret concern no on but himself
he turn around with a stifl exclam the hand that wa laid
on hi shoulder wa now place on the lip of a person with an eboni
skin with ey of jade and with an astrakhan cap on hi head the
persian the stranger kept up the gestur that recommend discret
and then at the moment when the astonish viscount wa about to ask
the reason of hi mysteri intervent bow and disappear
chapter xvi mme giri astound revel as to her person
relat with the opera ghost
befor follow the commissari into the manag offic i must
describ certain extraordinari occurr that took place in that
offic which remi and mercier had vainli tri to enter and into which
mm richard and moncharmin had lock themselv with an object which
the reader doe not yet know but which it is my duti as an historian
to reveal without further postpon
i have had occas to sai that the manag mood had undergon a
disagre chang for some time past and to convei the fact that thi
chang wa due not onli to the fall of the chandeli on the famou
night of the gala perform
the reader must know that the ghost had calmli been paid hi first
twenti thousand franc oh there had been wail and gnash of
teeth inde and yet the thing had happen as simpli as could be
on morn the manag found on their tabl an envelop address to
monsieur o g privat and accompani by a note from o g himself
the time ha come to carri out the claus in the memorandumbook
pleas put twenti note of a thousand franc each into thi envelop
seal it with your own seal and hand it to mme giri who will do what
is necessari
the manag did not hesit without wast time in ask how these
confound commun came to be deliv in an offic which thei
were care to keep lock thei seiz thi opportun of lai
hand on the mysteri blackmail and after tell the whole
stori under the promis of secreci to gabriel and mercier thei put
the twenti thousand franc into the envelop and without ask for
explan hand it to mme giri who had been reinstat in her
function the boxkeep displai no astonish i need hardli
sai that she wa well watch she went straight to the ghost box
and place the preciou envelop on the littl shelf attach to the
ledg the two manag as well as gabriel and mercier were hidden
in such a wai that thei did not lose sight of the envelop for a second
dure the perform and even afterward for as the envelop had not
move those who watch it did not move either and mme giri went
awai while the manag gabriel and mercier were still there at
last thei becam tire of wait and open the envelop after
ascertain that the seal had not been broken
at first sight richard and moncharmin thought that the note were
still there but soon thei perceiv that thei were not the same the
twenti real note were gone and had been replac by twenti note of
the bank of st farce1
the manag rage and fright were unmistak moncharmin want to
send for the commissari of polic but richard object he no doubt
had a plan for he said
dont let us make ourselv ridicul all pari would laugh at us
o g ha won the first game we will win the second
he wa think of the next month allow
nevertheless thei had been so absolut trick that thei were bound
to suffer a certain deject and upon my word it wa not difficult
to understand we must not forget that the manag had an idea at the
back of their mind all the time that thi strang incid might be
an unpleas practic joke on the part of their predecessor and that
it would not do to divulg it prematur on the other hand
moncharmin wa sometim troubl with a suspicion of richard himself
who occasion took fanci whim into hi head and so thei were
content to await event while keep an ey on mother giri richard
would not have her spoken to
if she is a confeder he said the note ar gone long ago but
in my opinion she is mere an idiot
she not the onli idiot in thi busi said moncharmin pensiv
well who could have thought it moan richard but dont be
afraid next time i shall have taken my precaut
the next time fell on the same dai that beheld the disappear of
christin daae in the morn a note from the ghost remind them
that the monei wa due it read
do just as you did last time it went veri well put the twenti
thousand in the envelop and hand it to our excel mme giri
and the note wa accompani by the usual envelop thei had onli to
insert the note
thi wa done about half an hour befor the curtain rose on the first
act of faust richard show the envelop to moncharmin then he
count the twenti thousandfranc note in front of him and put the
note into the envelop but without close it
and now he said let have mother giri in
the old woman wa sent for she enter with a sweep courtesi she
still wore her black taffeta dress the color of which wa rapidli
turn to rust and lilac to sai noth of the dingi bonnet she

the manag took it from her thei examin it and saw that it wa
fasten with seal stamp with their own manageri seal thei
open it it contain twenti bank of st farc note like those
which had so much astound them the month befor
how simpl said richard

so it wa the ghost who gave you thi envelop and told you to
substitut it for the on which we gave you and it wa the ghost who
told you to put the other into m richard pocket
ye it wa the ghost
then would you mind give us a specimen of your littl talent here
is the envelop act as though we knew noth

mme giri took the envelop with the twenti note insid it and made
for the door she wa on the point of go out when the two manag

and then how would you slip it into my pocket argu richard whom
moncharmin fix with hi left ey while keep hi right on mme
giri a proceed like to strain hi sight but moncharmin wa
prepar to go to ani length to discov the truth
i am to slip it into your pocket when you least expect it sir you
know that i alwai take a littl turn behind the scene in the cours
of the even and i often go with my daughter to the balletfoy
which i am entitl to do as her mother i bring her her shoe when
the ballet is about to begin in fact i come and go as i pleas
the subscrib come and go too so do you sir there ar lot
of peopl about i go behind you and slip the envelop into the
tailpocket of your dresscoat there no witchcraft about that
no witchcraft growl richard roll hi ey like jupit tonan
no witchcraft why iv just caught you in a lie you old witch
mme giri bristl with her three teeth stick out of her mouth
and why mai i ask
becaus i spent that even watch box five and the sham envelop
which you put there i did not go to the balletfoy for a second
no sir and i did not give you the envelop that even but at the
next perform on the even when the undersecretari of state
for fine art
at these word m richard suddenli interrupt mme giri

richard dresscoat
of cours exclaim richard look a littl pale it veri
clever of o g the problem which he had to solv wa thi how to do
awai with ani danger intermediari between the man who give the
twentythousand franc and the man who receiv it and by far the
best thing he could hit upon wa to come and take the monei from my
pocket without my notic it as i myself did not know that it wa
there it wonder
oh wonder no doubt moncharmin agre onli you forget
richard that i provid tenthousand franc of the twenti and that
nobodi put anyth in my pocket
1 flash note drawn on the bank of st farc in franc correspond
with those drawn on the bank of engrav in englandtransl
note
chapter xvii the safetypin again
moncharmin last phrase so dearli express the suspicion in which he
now held hi partner that it wa bound to caus a stormi explan
at the end of which it wa agre that richard should yield to all
moncharmin wish with the object of help him to discov the
miscreant who wa victim them
thi bring us to the interv after the garden act with the strang
conduct observ by m remi and those curiou laps from the digniti
that might be expect of the manag it wa arrang between
richard and moncharmin first that richard should repeat the exact
movement which he had made on the night of the disappear of the
first twentythousand franc and second that moncharmin should not
for an instant lose sight of richard coattail pocket into which
mme giri wa to slip the twentythousand franc
m richard went and place himself at the ident spot where he had
stood when he bow to the undersecretari for fine art m
moncharmin took up hi posit a few step behind him
mme giri pass rub up against m richard got rid of her
twentythousand franc in the manag coattail pocket and
disappear or rather she wa conjur awai in accord with
the instruct receiv from moncharmin a few minut earlier
mercier took the good ladi to the actingmanag offic and turn
the kei on her thu make it imposs for her to commun with
her ghost
meanwhil m richard wa bend and bow and scrape and walk
backward just as if he had that high and mighti minist the
undersecretari for fine art befor him onli though these mark of
polit would have creat no astonish if the undersecretari of
state had realli been in front of m richard thei caus an easili
comprehens amaz to the spectat of thi veri natur but
quit inexplic scene when m richard had no bodi in front of him
m richard bow to nobodi bent hi back befor nobodi and
walk backward befor nobodi and a few step behind him m
moncharmin did the same thing that he wa do in addit to push
awai m remi and beg m de la borderi the ambassador and the
manag of the credit central not to touch m le directeur
moncharmin who had hi own idea did not want richard to come to him
present when the twentythousand franc were gone and sai
perhap it wa the ambassador or the manag of the credit central
or remi
the more so as at the time of the first scene as richard himself
admit richard had met nobodi in that part of the theater after mme
giri had brush up against him
have begun by walk backward in order to bow richard continu to
do so from prudenc until he reach the passag lead to the
offic of the manag in thi wai he wa constantli watch by
moncharmin from behind and himself kept an ey on ani on approach
from the front onc more thi novel method of walk behind the
scene adopt by the manag of our nation academi of music
attract attent but the manag themselv thought of noth but
their twentythousand franc
on reach the halfdark passag richard said to moncharmin in a low
voic
i am sure that nobodi ha touch me you had now better keep at
some distanc from me and watch me till i come to door of the offic
it is better not to arous suspicion and we can see anyth that
happen
but moncharmin repli no richard no you walk ahead and ill
walk immedi behind you i wont leav you by a step
but in that case exclaim richard thei will never steal our
twentythousand franc
i should hope not inde declar moncharmin
then what we ar do is absurd
we ar do exactli what we did last time last time i join
you as you were leav the stage and follow close behind you down
thi passag
that true sigh richard shake hi head and passiv obei
moncharmin
two minut later the joint manag lock themselv into their
offic moncharmin himself put the kei in hi pocket
we remain lock up like thi last time he said until you left
the opera to go home
that so no on came and disturb us i suppos
no on
then said richard who wa try to collect hi memori then i
must certainli have been rob on my wai home from the opera
no said moncharmin in a drier tone than ever no that
imposs for i drop you in my cab the twentythousand franc
disappear at your place there not a shadow of a doubt about that
it incred protest richard i am sure of my servant
and if on of them had done it he would have disappear sinc
moncharmin shrug hi shoulder as though to sai that he did not
wish to enter into detail and richard began to think that moncharmin
wa treat him in a veri insupport fashion
moncharmin iv had enough of thi
richard iv had too much of it
do you dare to suspect me
ye of a silli joke
on doesnt joke with twentythousand franc
that what i think declar moncharmin unfold a newspap and
ostentati studi it content
what ar you do ask richard ar you go to read the paper
next
ye richard until i take you home
like last time
ye like last time
richard snatch the paper from moncharmin hand moncharmin stood
up more irrit than ever and found himself face by an exasper
richard who cross hi arm on hi chest said
look here im think of thi im think of what i might think
if like last time after my spend the even alon with you you
brought me home and if at the moment of part i perceiv that
twentythousand franc had disappear from my coatpocket like
last time
and what might you think ask moncharmin crimson with rage
i might think that as you hadnt left me by a foot breadth and as
by your own wish you were the onli on to approach me like last time
i might think that if that twentythousand franc wa no longer in my
pocket it stood a veri good chanc of be in your
moncharmin leap up at the suggest
oh he shout a safetypin
what do you want a safetypin for
to fasten you up with a safetypin a safetypin
you want to fasten me with a safetypin
ye to fasten you to the twentythousand franc then whether it
here or on the drive from here to your place or at your place you
will feel the hand that pull at your pocket and you will see if it
mine oh so your suspect me now ar you a safetypin
and that wa the moment when moncharmin open the door on the passag
and shout
a safetypin somebodi give me a safetypin
and we also know how at the same moment remi who had no safetypin
wa receiv by moncharmin while a boi procur the pin so eagerli
long for and what happen wa thi moncharmin first lock the
door again then he knelt down behind richard back
i hope he said that the note ar still there
so do i said richard
the real on ask moncharmin resolv not to be had thi time
look for yourself said richard i refus to touch them
moncharmin took the envelop from richard pocket and drew out the
banknot with a trembl hand for thi time in order frequent
to make sure of the presenc of the note he had not seal the
envelop nor even fasten it he felt reassur on find that thei
were all there and quit genuin he put them back in the tailpocket
and pin them with great care then he sat down behind richard
coattail and kept hi ey fix on them while richard sit at
hi writingt did not stir
a littl patienc richard said moncharmin we have onli a few
minut to wait the clock will soon strike twelv last time we
left at the last stroke of twelv
oh i shall have all the patienc necessari
the time pass slow heavi mysteri stifl richard tri to
laugh
i shall end by believ in the omnipot of the ghost he said
just now dont you find someth uncomfort disquiet
alarm in the atmospher of thi room
your quit right said moncharmin who wa realli impress
the ghost continu richard in a low voic as though fear lest
he should be overheard by invis ear the ghost suppos all
the same it were a ghost who put the magic envelop on the tabl
who talk in box five who kill joseph buquet who unhook
the chandeli and who rob us for after all after all after
all there is no on here except you and me and if the note
disappear and neither you nor i have anyth to do with it well we
shall have to believ in the ghost in the ghost
at that moment the clock on the mantlepiec gave it warn click and
the first stroke of twelv struck
the two manag shudder the perspir stream from their
forehead the twelfth stroke sound strang in their ear
when the clock stop thei gave a sigh and rose from their chair
i think we can go now said moncharmin

richard tore off hi coat the two manag turn the pocket insid
out the pocket wa empti and the curiou thing wa that the pin

about the witchcraft

tonight there is no other declar the persian in a singularli
mourn voic and now look out and be readi to fire
he himself rais hi pistol opposit the glass raoul imit hi
movement with hi free arm the persian drew the young man to hi
chest and suddenli the mirror turn in a blind daze of
crosslight it turn like on of those revolv door which have
late been fix to the entranc of most restaur it turn
carri raoul and the persian with it and suddenli hurl them from
the full light into the deepest dark
chapter xx in the cellar of the opera
your hand high readi to fire repeat raoul companion quickli
the wall behind them have complet the circl which it describ
upon itself close again and the two men stood motionless for a
moment hold their breath
at last the persian decid to make a movement and raoul heard him
slip on hi knee and feel for someth in the dark with hi grope
hand suddenli the dark wa made visibl by a small dark lantern
and raoul instinct step backward as though to escap the
scrutini of a secret enemi but he soon perceiv that the light
belong to the persian whose movement he wa close observ the
littl red disk wa turn in everi direct and raoul saw that the
floor the wall and the ceil were all form of plank it must
have been the ordinari road taken by erik to reach christin
dressingroom and impos upon her innoc and raoul rememb
the persian remark thought that it had been mysteri construct
by the ghost himself later he learn that erik had found all
prepar for him a secret passag long known to himself alon and
contriv at the time of the pari commun to allow the jailer to
convei their prison straight to the dungeon that had been
construct for them in the cellar for the feder had occupi the
operahous immedi after the eighteenth of march and had made a
startingplac right at the top for their mongolfi balloon which
carri their incendiari proclam to the depart and a state
prison right at the bottom
the persian went on hi knee and put hi lantern on the ground he
seem to be work at the floor and suddenli he turn off hi
light then raoul heard a faint click and saw a veri pale lumin
squar in the floor of the passag it wa as though a window had
open on the opera cellar which were still lit raoul no longer saw
the persian but he suddenli felt him by hi side and heard him whisper
follow me and do all that i do
raoul turn to the lumin apertur then he saw the persian who
wa still on hi knee hang by hi hand from the rim of the open
with hi pistol between hi teeth and slide into the cellar below
curious enough the viscount had absolut confid in the persian
though he knew noth about him hi emot when speak of the
monster struck him as sincer and if the persian had cherish ani
sinist design against him he would not have arm him with hi own
hand besid raoul must reach christin at all cost he therefor
went on hi knee also and hung from the trap with both hand
let go said a voic
and he drop into the arm of the persian who told him to lie down
flat close the trapdoor abov him and crouch down besid him
raoul tri to ask a question but the persian hand wa on hi mouth
and he heard a voic which he recogn as that of the commissari of
polic
raoul and the persian were complet hidden behind a wooden partit
near them a small staircas led to a littl room in which the
commissari appear to be walk up and down ask question the
faint light wa just enough to enabl raoul to distinguish the shape of
thing around him and he could not restrain a dull cry there were
three corps there
the first lai on the narrow land of the littl staircas the two
other had roll to the bottom of the staircas raoul could have
touch on of the two poor wretch by pass hi finger through the
partit
silenc whisper the persian
he too had seen the bodi and he gave on word in explan
he
the commissari voic wa now heard more distinctli he wa ask
for inform about the system of light which the stagemanag
suppli the commissari therefor must be in the organ or it
immedi neighborhood
contrari to what on might think especi in connect with an
operahous the organ is not a music instrument at that time
electr wa emploi onli for a veri few scenic effect and for the
bell the immens build and the stage itself were still lit by
ga hydrogen wa us to regul and modifi the light of a scene
and thi wa done by mean of a special apparatu which becaus of the
multipl of it pipe wa known as the organ a box besid the
prompter box wa reserv for the chief gasman who from there gave
hi order to hi assist and saw that thei were execut mauclair
stai in thi box dure all the perform
but now mauclair wa not in hi box and hi assist not in their
place
mauclair mauclair
the stagemanag voic echo through the cellar but mauclair did
not repli
i have said that a door open on a littl staircas that led to the
second cellar the commissari push it but it resist
i sai he said to the stagemanag i cant open thi door is it
alwai so difficult
the stagemanag forc it open with hi shoulder he saw that at
the same time he wa push a human bodi and he could not keep back
an exclam for he recogn the bodi at onc
mauclair poor devil he is dead
but mr commissari mifroid whom noth surpris wa stoop over
that big bodi
no he said he is deaddrunk which is not quit the same thing
it the first time if so said the stagemanag
then some on ha given him a narcot that is quit possibl
mifroid went down a few step and said
look
by the light of a littl red lantern at the foot of the stair thei
saw two other bodi the stagemanag recogn mauclair
assist mifroid went down and listen to their breath
thei ar sound asleep he said veri curiou busi some person
unknown must have interf with the gasman and hi staff and
that person unknown wa obvious work on behalf of the kidnapp
but what a funni idea to kidnap a perform on the stage send
for the doctor of the theater pleas and mifroid repeat curiou
decidedli curiou busi
then he turn to the littl room address the peopl whom raoul and
the persian were unabl to see from where thei lai
what do you sai to all thi gentlemen you ar the onli on who
have not given your view and yet you must have an opinion of some
sort
thereupon raoul and the persian saw the startl face of the joint
manag appear abov the landingand thei heard moncharmin excit
voic
there ar thing happen here mr commissari which we ar unabl
to explain
and the two face disappear
thank you for the inform gentlemen said mifroid with a jeer
but the stagemanag hold hi chin in the hollow of hi right
hand which is the attitud of profound thought said
it is not the first time that mauclair ha fallen asleep in the
theater i rememb find him on even snore in hi littl
recess with hi snuffbox besid him
is that long ago ask m mifroid carefulli wipe hi eyeglass
no not so veri long ago wait a bit it wa the night of
cours ye it wa the night when carlottay know mr
commissarygav her famou coack
realli the night when carlotta gave her famou coack
and m mifroid replac hi gleam glass on hi nose fix the
stagemanag with a contempl stare
so mauclair take snuff doe he he ask carelessli
ye mr commissari look there is hi snuffbox on that littl
shelf oh he a great snufftak
so am i said mifroid and put the snuffbox in hi pocket
raoul and the persian themselv unobserv watch the remov of
the three bodi by a number of sceneshift who were follow by
the commissari and all the peopl with him their step were heard for
a few minut on the stage abov when thei were alon the persian
made a sign to raoul to stand up raoul did so but as he did not
lift hi hand in front of hi ey readi to fire the persian told him
to resum that attitud and to continu it whatev happen
but it tire the hand unnecessarili whisper raoul if i do fire
i shant be sure of my aim
then shift your pistol to the other hand said the persian
i cant shoot with my left hand
thereupon the persian made thi queer repli which wa certainli not
calcul to throw light into the young man flurri brain
it not a question of shoot with the right hand or the left it
a question of hold on of your hand as though you were go to
pull the trigger of a pistol with your arm bent as for the pistol
itself when all is said you can put that in your pocket and he
ad let thi be clearli understood or i will answer for noth
it is a matter of life and death and now silenc and follow me
the cellar of the opera ar enorm and thei ar five in number
raoul follow the persian and wonder what he would have done without
hi companion in that extraordinari labyrinth thei went down to the
third cellar and their progress wa still lit by some distant lamp
the lower thei went the more precaut the persian seem to take
he kept on turn to raoul to see if he wa hold hi arm properli
show him how he himself carri hi hand as if alwai readi to fire
though the pistol wa in hi pocket
suddenli a loud voic made them stop some on abov them shout
all the doorshutt on the stage the commissari of polic want
them
step were heard and shadow glide through the dark the persian
drew raoul behind a set piec thei saw pass befor and abov them
old men bent by ag and the past burden of operasceneri some could
hardli drag themselv along other from habit with stoop bodi
and outstretch hand look for door to shut
thei were the doorshutt the old wornout sceneshift on whom
a charit manag had taken piti give them the job of shut
door abov and below the stage thei went about incessantli from top
to bottom of the build shut the door and thei were also
call the draftexpel at least at that time for i have littl
doubt that by now thei ar all dead draft ar veri bad for the
voic wherev thei mai come from1
the two men might have stumbl over them wake them up and provok
a request for explan for the moment m mifroid inquiri save
them from ani such unpleas encount
the persian and raoul welcom thi incid which reliev them of
inconveni wit for some of those doorshutt have noth
els to do or nowher to lai their head stai at the opera from
idl or necess and spent the night there
but thei were not left to enjoi their solitud for long other shade
now came down by the same wai by which the doorshutt had gone up
each of these shade carri a littl lantern and move it about
abov below and all around as though look for someth or
somebodi
hang it mutter the persian i dont know what thei ar look
for but thei might easili find us let us get awai quick
your hand up sir readi to fire bend your arm more that
it hand at the level of your ey as though you were fight a
duel and wait for the word to fire oh leav your pistol in your
pocket quick come along downstair level of your ey question
of life or death here thi wai these stair thei reach the
fifth cellar oh what a duel sir what a duel
onc in the fifth cellar the persian drew breath he seem to enjoi
a rather greater sens of secur than he had displai when thei both
stop in the third but he never alter the attitud of hi hand
and raoul rememb the persian observationi know these pistol
can be reli uponwa more and more astonish wonder why ani
on should be so gratifi at be abl to reli upon a pistol which he
did not intend to us
but the persian left him no time for reflect tell raoul to stai
where he wa he ran up a few step of the staircas which thei had
just left and then return
how stupid of us he whisper we shall soon have seen the end of
those men with their lantern it is the firemen go their
rounds2
the two men wait five minut longer then the persian took raoul up
the stair again but suddenli he stop him with a gestur
someth move in the dark befor them
flat on your stomach whisper the persian
the two men lai flat on the floor
thei were onli just in time a shade thi time carri no light
just a shade in the shade pass it pass close to them near
enough to touch them
thei felt the warmth of it cloak upon them for thei could
distinguish the shade suffici to see that it wore a cloak which
shroud it from head to foot on it head it had a soft felt hat
it move awai draw it feet against the wall and sometim give
a kick into a corner
whew said the persian weve had a narrow escap that shade know
me and ha twice taken me to the manag offic
is it some on belong to the theater polic ask raoul
it some on much wors than that repli the persian without
give ani further explanation3
it not he
he if he doe not come behind us we shall alwai see hi yellow
ey that is more or less our safeguard tonight but he mai come
from behind steal up and we ar dead men if we do not keep our
hand as though about to fire at the level of our ey in front
the persian had hardli finish speak when a fantast face came in
sight a whole fieri face not onli two yellow ey
ye a head of fire came toward them at a man height but with no
bodi attach to it the face shed fire look in the dark like a
flame shape as a man face
oh said the persian between hi teeth i have never seen thi
befor pampin wa not mad after all he had seen it what
can that flame be it is not he but he mai have sent it take
care take care your hand at the level of your ey in heaven
name at the level of your ey know most of hi trick but
not thi on come let us run it is safer hand at the level
of your ey
and thei fled down the long passag that open befor them
after a few second that seem to them like long minut thei
stop
he doesnt often come thi wai said the persian thi side ha
noth to do with him thi side doe not lead to the lake nor to the
hous on the lake but perhap he know that we ar at hi heel
although i promis him to leav him alon and never to meddl in
hi busi again
so sai he turn hi head and raoul also turn hi head and thei
again saw the head of fire behind their two head it had follow
them and it must have run also and perhap faster than thei for it
seem to be nearer to them
at the same time thei began to perceiv a certain nois of which thei
could not guess the natur thei simpli notic that the sound seem
to move and to approach with the fieri face it wa a nois as though
thousand of nail had been scrape against a blackboard the perfectli
unendur nois that is sometim made by a littl stone insid the
chalk that grate on the blackboard
thei continu to retreat but the fieri face came on came on gain
on them thei could see it featur clearli now the ey were round
and stare the nose a littl crook and the mouth larg with a
hang lower lip veri like the ey nose and lip of the moon when
the moon is quit red bright red
how did that red moon manag to glide through the dark at a man
height with noth to support it at least appar and how did
it go so fast so straight ahead with such stare stare ey and
what wa that scratch scrape grate sound which it brought with
it
the persian and raoul could retreat no farther and flatten themselv
against the wall not know what wa go to happen becaus of that
incomprehens head of fire and especi now becaus of the more
intens swarm live numer sound for the sound wa
certainli made up of hundr of littl sound that move in the
dark under the fieri face
and the fieri face came on with it nois came level with them
and the two companion flat against their wall felt their hair stand
on end with horror for thei now knew what the thousand nois meant
thei came in a troop hustl along in the shadow by innumer littl
hurri wave swifter than the wave that rush over the sand at high
tide littl nightwav foam under the moon under the fieri head
that wa like a moon and the littl wave pass between their leg
climb up their leg irresist and raoul and the persian could
no longer restrain their cri of horror dismai and pain nor could
thei continu to hold their hand at the level of their ey their
hand went down to their leg to push back the wave which were full
of littl leg and nail and claw and teeth
ye raoul and the persian were readi to faint like pampin the
fireman but the head of fire turn round in answer to their cri
and spoke to them
dont move dont move whatev you do dont come after me
i am the ratcatch let me pass with my rat
and the head of fire disappear vanish in the dark while the
passag in front of it lit up as the result of the chang which the
ratcatch had made in hi dark lantern befor so as not to scare
the rat in front of him he had turn hi dark lantern on himself
light up hi own head now to hasten their flight he lit the dark
space in front of him and he jump along drag with him the
wave of scratch rat all the thousand sound
raoul and the persian breath again though still trembl
i ought to have rememb that erik talk to me about the
ratcatch said the persian but he never told me that he look
like that and it funni that i should never have met him befor
of cours erik never come to thi part
illustr two page color illustr

he will hear us too and as you know him we shall talk to him
babi said the persian we shall never enter the hous on the lake
by the lake i myself have never land on the other bank the
bank on which the hous stand you have to cross the lake first
and it is well guard i fear that more than on of those
menold sceneshift old doorshutterswho have never been seen

under the water the siren voic
but then what ar we here for ask raoul in a transport of fever
impati and rage if you can do noth for christin at least
let me die for her the persian tri to calm the young man
we have onli on mean of save christin daae believ me which is
to enter the hous unperceiv by the monster
and is there ani hope of that sir
ah if i had not that hope i would not have come to fetch you
and how can on enter the hous on the lake without cross the lake
from the third cellar from which we were so unluckili driven awai
we will go back there now i will tell you said the persian with
a sudden chang in hi voic i will tell you the exact place sir it
is between a set piec and a discard scene from roi de lahor
exactli at the spot where joseph buquet di come sir take
courag and follow me and hold your hand at the level of your ey
but where ar we
the persian lit hi lamp again and flung it rai down two enorm
corridor that cross each other at right angl
we must be he said in the part us more particularli for the
waterwork i see no fire come from the furnac
he went in front of raoul seek hi road stop abruptli when he
wa afraid of meet some waterman then thei had to protect
themselv against the glow of a sort of underground forg which the
men were extinguish and at which raoul recogn the demon whom
christin had seen at the time of her first captiv
in thi wai thei gradual arriv beneath the huge cellar below the
stage thei must at thi time have been at the veri bottom of the
tub and at an extrem great depth when we rememb that the earth
wa dug out at fifti feet below the water that lai under the whole of
that part of paris4
the persian touch a partitionwal and said
if i am not mistaken thi is a wall that might easili belong to the
hous on the lake
he wa strike a partitionwal of the tub and perhap it would be
as well for the reader to know how the bottom and the partitionwal
of the tub were built in order to prevent the water surround the
buildingoper from remain in immedi contact with the wall
support the whole of the theatric machineri the architect wa
oblig to build a doubl case in everi direct the work of
construct thi doubl case took a whole year it wa the wall of
the first inner case that the persian struck when speak to raoul of
the hous on the lake to ani on understand the architectur of
the edific the persian action would seem to indic that erik
mysteri hous had been built in the doubl case form of a thick
wall construct as an embank or dam then of a brick wall a
tremend layer of cement and anoth wall sever yard in thick
at the persian word raoul flung himself against the wall and
listen eagerli but he heard noth noth except distant
step sound on the floor of the upper portion of the theater
the persian darken hi lantern again
look out he said keep your hand up and silenc for we shall
try anoth wai of get in
and he led him to the littl staircas by which thei had come down
late
thei went up stop at each step peer into the dark and the
silenc till thei came to the third cellar here the persian motion
to raoul to go on hi knee and in thi wai crawl on both knee
and on handfor the other hand wa held in the posit
indicatedthei reach the end wall
against thi wall stood a larg discard scene from the roi de lahor
close to thi scene wa a set piec between the scene and the set
piec there wa just room for a bodi for a bodi which on dai wa
found hang there the bodi of joseph buquet
the persian still kneel stop and listen for a moment he
seem to hesit and look at raoul then he turn hi ey upward
toward the second cellar which sent down the faint glimmer of a
lantern through a cranni between two board thi glimmer seem to
troubl the persian
at last he toss hi head and made up hi mind to act he slip
between the set piec and the scene from the roi de lahor with raoul
close upon hi heel with hi free hand the persian felt the wall
raoul saw him bear heavili upon the wall just as he had press
against the wall in christin dressingroom then a stone gave wai
leav a hole in the wall
thi time the persian took hi pistol from hi pocket and made a sign
to raoul to do as he did he cock the pistol
and resolut still on hi knee he wiggl through the hole in the
wall raoul who had wish to pass first had to be content to follow
him
the hole wa veri narrow the persian stop almost at onc raoul
heard him feel the stone around him then the persian took out hi
dark lantern again stoop forward examin someth beneath him and
immedi extinguish hi lantern raoul heard him sai in a
whisper
we shall have to drop a few yard without make a nois take off
your boot
the persian hand hi own shoe to raoul
put them outsid the wall he said we shall find them there when
we leave5
he crawl a littl farther on hi knee then turn right round and
said
i am go to hang by my hand from the edg of the stone and let
myself drop into hi hous you must do exactli the same do not be
afraid i will catch you in my arm
raoul soon heard a dull sound evid produc by the fall of the
persian and then drop down
he felt himself clasp in the persian arm
hush said the persian
and thei stood motionless listen
the dark wa thick around them the silenc heavi and terribl
then the persian began to make plai with the dark lantern again
turn the rai over their head look for the hole through which
thei had come and fail to find it
oh he said the stone ha close of itself
and the light of the lantern swept down the wall and over the floor
the persian stoop and pick up someth a sort of cord which he
examin for a second and flung awai with horror
the punjab lasso he mutter
what is it ask raoul
the persian shiver it might veri well be the rope by which the man
wa hang and which wa look for so long
and suddenli seiz with fresh anxieti he move the littl red disk
of hi lantern over the wall in thi wai he lit up a curiou thing
the trunk of a tree which seem still quit aliv with it leav
and the branch of that tree ran right up the wall and disappear in
the ceil
becaus of the small of the lumin disk it wa difficult at
first to make out the appear of thing thei saw a corner of a
branch and a leaf and anoth leaf and next to it noth
at all noth but the rai of light that seem to reflect itself
raoul pass hi hand over that noth over that reflect
hullo he said the wall is a lookingglass
ye a lookingglass said the persian in a tone of deep emot
and pass the hand that held the pistol over hi moist forehead he
ad we have drop into the torturechamb
what the persian knew of thi torturechamb and what there befel him
and hi companion shall be told in hi own word as set down in a
manuscript which he left behind him and which i copi verbatim
1 m pedro gailhard ha himself told me that he creat a few
addit post as doorshutt for old stagecarpent whom he wa
unwil to dismiss from the servic of the opera
2 in those dai it wa still part of the firemen duti to watch
over the safeti of the opera hous outsid the perform but thi
servic ha sinc been suppress i ask m pedro gailhard the
reason and he repli
it wa becaus the manag wa afraid that in their utter
inexperi of the cellar of the opera the firemen might set fire to
the build

chapter xxi interest and instruct vicissitud of a persian in
the cellar of the opera
the persian narr
it wa the first time that i enter the hous on the lake i had
often beg the trapdoor lover as we us to call erik in my
countri to open it mysteri door to me he alwai refus i
made veri mani attempt but in vain to obtain admitt watch him
as i might after i first learn that he had taken up hi perman
abod at the opera the dark wa alwai too thick to enabl me to
see how he work the door in the wall on the lake on dai when i
thought myself alon i step into the boat and row toward that
part of the wall through which i had seen erik disappear it wa then
that i came into contact with the siren who guard the approach and
whose charm wa veri nearli fatal to me
i had no sooner put off from the bank than the silenc amid which i
float on the water wa disturb by a sort of whisper sing that
hover all around me it wa half breath half music it rose softli
from the water of the lake and i wa surround by it through i knew
not what artific it follow me move with me and wa so soft that
it did not alarm me on the contrari in my long to approach the
sourc of that sweet and entic harmoni i lean out of my littl
boat over the water for there wa no doubt in my mind that the sing
came from the water itself by thi time i wa alon in the boat in
the middl of the lake the voicefor it wa now distinctli a
voicewa besid me on the water i lean over lean still
farther the lake wa perfectli calm and a moonbeam that pass
through the air hole in the rue scribe show me absolut noth on
it surfac which wa smooth and black as ink i shook my ear to get
rid of a possibl hum but i soon had to accept the fact that there
wa no hum in the ear so harmoni as the sing whisper that
follow and now attract me
had i been inclin to superstit i should have certainli thought
that i had to do with some siren whose busi it wa to confound the
travel who should ventur on the water of the hous on the lake
fortun i come from a countri where we ar too fond of fantast
thing not to know them through and through and i had no doubt but
that i wa face to face with some new invent of erik but thi
invent wa so perfect that as i lean out of the boat i wa
impel less by a desir to discov it trick than to enjoi it
charm and i lean out lean out until i almost overturn the boat
suddenli two monstrou arm issu from the bosom of the water and
seiz me by the neck drag me down to the depth with irresist
forc i should certainli have been lost if i had not had time to
give a cry by which erik knew me for it wa he and instead of
drown me as wa certainli hi first intent he swam with me and
laid me gentli on the bank
how imprud you ar he said as he stood befor me drip with
water why try to enter my hous i never invit you i dont want
you there nor anybodi did you save my life onli to make it
unbear to me howev great the servic you render him erik mai
end by forget it and you know that noth can restrain erik not
even erik himself
he spoke but i had now no other wish than to know what i alreadi
call the trick of the siren he satisfi my curios for erik
who is a real monsteri have seen him at work in persia alasi
also in certain respect a regular child vain and selfconceit
and there is noth he love so much after astonish peopl as to
prove all the realli miracul ingenu of hi mind
he laugh and show me a long reed
it the silliest trick you ever saw he said but it veri us
for breath and sing in the water i learn it from the tonkin
pirat who ar abl to remain hidden for hour in the bed of the
rivers1
i spoke to him sever
it a trick that nearli kill me i said and it mai have been
fatal to other you know what you promis me erik no more
murder
have i realli commit murder he ask put on hi most
amiabl air
wretch man i cri have you forgotten the rosi hour of
mazenderan
ye he repli in a sadder tone i prefer to forget them i us
to make the littl sultana laugh though
all that belong to the past i declar but there is the present
and you ar respons to me for the present becaus if i had
wish there would have been none at all for you rememb that
erik i save your life
and i took advantag of the turn of convers to speak to him of
someth that had long been on my mind
erik i ask erik swear that
what he retort you know i never keep my oath oath ar made
to catch gull with
tell me you can tell me at ani rate
well
well the chandeli the chandeli erik
what about the chandeli
you know what i mean
oh he snigger i dont mind tell you about the chandeli
it wasnt i the chandeli wa veri old and worn
when erik laugh he wa more terribl than ever he jump into the
boat chuckl so horribl that i could not help trembl
veri old and worn my dear daroga2 veri old and worn the
chandeli it fell of itself it came down with a smash
and now daroga take my advic and go and dry yourself or youll
catch a cold in the head and never get into my boat again
and whatev you do dont try to enter my hous im not alwai
there daroga and i should be sorri to have to dedic my requiem
mass to you
so sai swing to and fro like a monkei and still chuckl he
push off and soon disappear in the dark of the lake
from that dai i gave up all thought of penetr into hi hous by
the lake that entranc wa obvious too well guard especi
sinc he had learn that i knew about it but i felt that there must
be anoth entranc for i had often seen erik disappear in the third
cellar when i wa watch him though i could not imagin how
ever sinc i had discov erik instal in the opera i live in a
perpetu terror of hi horribl fanci not in so far as i wa
concern but i dread everyth for others3
and whenev some accid some fatal event happen i alwai thought
to myself i should not be surpris if that were erik even as
other us to sai it the ghost how often have i not heard
peopl utter that phrase with a smile poor devil if thei had known
that the ghost exist in the flesh i swear thei would not have
laugh
although erik announc to me veri solemnli that he had chang and
that he had becom the most virtuou of men sinc he wa love for
himselfa sentenc that at first perplex me most terriblyi could
not help shudder when i thought of the monster hi horribl
unparallel and repuls ugli put him without the pale of
human and it often seem to me that for thi reason he no longer
believ that he had ani duti toward the human race the wai in which
he spoke of hi love affair onli increas my alarm for i foresaw the
caus of fresh and more hideou tragedi in thi event to which he
allud so boastfulli
on the other hand i soon discov the curiou moral traffic
establish between the monster and christin daae hide in the
lumberroom next to the young prima donna dressingroom i listen
to wonder music displai that evid flung christin into
marvel ecstasi but all the same i would never have thought that
erik voicewhich wa loud as thunder or soft as angel voic at
willcould have made her forget hi ugli i understood all when i
learn that christin had not yet seen him i had occas to go to
the dressingroom and rememb the lesson he had onc given me i
had no difficulti in discov the trick that made the wall with the
mirror swing round and i ascertain the mean of hollow brick and so
onbi which he made hi voic carri to christin as though she heard
it close besid her in thi wai also i discov the road that led
to the well and the dungeonth communist dungeonand also the
trapdoor that enabl erik to go straight to the cellar below the
stage
a few dai later what wa not my amaz to learn by my own ey and
ear that erik and christin daae saw each other and to catch the
monster stoop over the littl well in the communist road and
sprinkl the forehead of christin daae who had faint a white
hors the hors out of the profeta which had disappear from the
stabl under the opera wa stand quietli besid them i show
myself it wa terribl i saw spark fly from those yellow ey and
befor i had time to sai a word i receiv a blow on the head that
stun me
when i came to myself erik christin and the white hors had
disappear i felt sure that the poor girl wa a prison in the
hous on the lake without hesit i resolv to return to the
bank notwithstand the attend danger for twentyfour hour i
lai in wait for the monster to appear for i felt that he must go out
driven by the need of obtain provis and in thi connect i
mai sai that when he went out in the street or ventur to show
himself in public he wore a pasteboard nose with a mustach attach
to it instead of hi own horribl hole of a nose thi did not quit
take awai hi corpselik air but it made him almost i sai almost
endur to look at
i therefor watch on the bank of the lake and weari of long wait
wa begin to think that he had gone through the other door the
door in the third cellar when i heard a slight splash in the dark
i saw the two yellow ey shine like candl and soon the boat
touch shore erik jump out and walk up to me

now be off for i must go and do some shop
to my intens astonish thing happen as he had announc
christin daae left the hous on the lake and return to it sever
time without appar be forc to do so it wa veri
difficult for me to clear my mind of erik howev i resolv to be
extrem prudent and did not make the mistak of return to the
shore of the lake or of go by the communist road but the idea
of the secret entranc in the third cellar haunt me and i repeatedli
went and wait for hour behind a scene from the roi de lahor which
had been left there for some reason or other at last my patienc wa
reward on dai i saw the monster come toward me on hi knee i
wa certain that he could not see me he pass between the scene
behind which i stood and a set piec went to the wall and press on a
spring that move a stone and afford him an ingress he pass
through thi and the stone close behind him
i wait for at least thirti minut and then press the spring in my
turn everyth happen as with erik but i wa care not to go
through the hole myself for i knew that erik wa insid on the other
hand the idea that i might be caught by erik suddenli made me think of
the death of joseph buquet i did not wish to jeopard the
advantag of so great a discoveri which might be us to mani
peopl to a goodli number of the human race in erik word and i
left the cellar of the opera after carefulli replac the stone
i continu to be greatli interest in the relat between erik and
christin daae not from ani morbid curios but becaus of the
terribl thought which obsess my mind that erik wa capabl of
anyth if he onc discov that he wa not love for hi own sake
as he imagin i continu to wander veri cautious about the
opera and soon learn the truth about the monster dreari loveaffair
he fill christin mind through the terror with which he inspir
her but the dear child heart belong wholli to the vicomt raoul de
chagni while thei plai about like an innoc engag coupl on
the upper floor of the opera to avoid the monster thei littl
suspect that some on wa watch over them i wa prepar to do
anyth to kill the monster if necessari and explain to the polic
afterward but erik did not show himself and i felt none the more
comfort for that
i must explain my whole plan i thought that the monster be driven
from hi hous by jealousi would thu enabl me to enter it without
danger through the passag in the third cellar it wa import for
everybodi sake that i should know exactli what wa insid on dai
tire of wait for an opportun i move the stone and at onc
heard an astound music the monster wa work at hi don juan
triumphant with everi door in hi hous wide open i knew that thi
wa the work of hi life i wa care not to stir and remain
prudent in my dark hole
he stop plai for a moment and began walk about hi place
like a madman and he said aloud at the top of hi voic
it must be finish first quit finish
thi speech wa not calcul to reassur me and when the music
recommenc i close the stone veri softli
on the dai of the abduct of christin daae i did not come to the
theater until rather late in the even trembl lest i should hear
bad new i had spent a horribl dai for after read in a morn
paper the announc of a forthcom marriag between christin and
the vicomt de chagni i wonder whether after all i should not do
better to denounc the monster but reason return to me and i wa
persuad that thi action could onli precipit a possibl
catastroph
when my cab set me down befor the opera i wa realli almost
astonish to see it still stand but i am someth of a fatalist
like all good orient and i enter readi for anyth
christin daae abduct in the prison act which natur surpris
everybodi found me prepar i wa quit certain that she had been
juggl awai by erik that princ of conjur and i thought
posit that thi wa the end of christin and perhap of everybodi
so much so that i thought of advis all these peopl who were stai
on at the theater to make good their escap i felt howev that
thei would be sure to look upon me as mad and i refrain
on the other hand i resolv to act without further delai as far as i
wa concern the chanc were in my favor that erik at that moment
wa think onli of hi captiv thi wa the moment to enter hi
hous through the third cellar and i resolv to take with me that
poor littl desper viscount who at the first suggest accept
with an amount of confid in myself that touch me profoundli i
had sent my servant for my pistol i gave on to the viscount and
advis him to hold himself readi to fire for after all erik might
be wait for us behind the wall we were to go by the communist
road and through the trapdoor
see my pistol the littl viscount ask me if we were go to
fight a duel i said
ye and what a duel but of cours i had no time to explain
anyth to him the littl viscount is a brave fellow but he knew
hardli anyth about hi adversari and it wa so much the better my
great fear wa that he wa alreadi somewher near us prepar the
punjab lasso no on know better than he how to throw the punjab
lasso for he is the king of strangler even as he is the princ of
conjuror when he had finish make the littl sultana laugh at
the time of the rosi hour of mazenderan she herself us to ask him
to amus her by give her a thrill it wa then that he introduc
the sport of the punjab lasso
he had live in india and acquir an incred skill in the art of
strangul he would make them lock him into a courtyard to which
thei brought a warriorusu a man condemn to deatharm with a
long pike and broadsword erik had onli hi lasso and it wa alwai
just when the warrior thought that he wa go to fell erik with a
tremend blow that we heard the lasso whistl through the air with
a turn of the wrist erik tighten the noos round hi adversari
neck and in thi fashion drag him befor the littl sultana and
her women who sat look from a window and applaud the littl
sultana herself learn to wield the punjab lasso and kill sever of
her women and even of the friend who visit her but i prefer to
drop thi terribl subject of the rosi hour of mazenderan i have
mention it onli to explain why on arriv with the vicomt de
chagni in the cellar of the opera i wa bound to protect my companion
against the everthreaten danger of death by strangl my pistol
could serv no purpos for erik wa not like to show himself but
erik could alwai strangl us i had no time to explain all thi to
the viscount besid there wa noth to be gain by complic
the posit i simpli told m de chagni to keep hi hand at the level
of hi ey with the arm bent as though wait for the command to
fire with hi victim in thi attitud it is imposs even for the
most expert strangler to throw the lasso with advantag it catch
you not onli round the neck but also round the arm or hand thi
enabl you easili to unloos the lasso which then becom harmless
after avoid the commissari of polic a number of doorshutt and
the firemen after meet the ratcatch and pass the man in the
felt hat unperceiv the viscount and i arriv without obstacl in
the third cellar between the set piec and the scene from the roi de
lahor i work the stone and we jump into the hous which erik
had built himself in the doubl case of the foundationwal of the
opera and thi wa the easiest thing in the world for him to do
becaus erik wa on of the chief contractor under philipp garnier
the architect of the opera and continu to work by himself when the
work were offici suspend dure the war the sieg of pari and
the commun
i knew my erik too well to feel at all comfort on jump into hi
hous i knew what he had made of a certain palac at mazenderan
from be the most honest build conceiv he soon turn it into
a hous of the veri devil where you could not utter a word but it wa
overheard or repeat by an echo with hi trapdoor the monster wa
respons for endless tragedi of all kind he hit upon
astonish invent of these the most curiou horribl and
danger wa the socal torturechamb except in special case
when the littl sultana amus herself by inflict suffer upon
some unoffend citizen no on wa let into it but wretch condemn
to death and even then when these had had enough thei were
alwai at liberti to put an end to themselv with a punjab lasso or
bowstr left for their us at the foot of an iron tree
my alarm therefor wa great when i saw that the room into which m
le vicomt de chagni and i had drop wa an exact copi of the
torturechamb of the rosi hour of mazenderan at our feet i found
the punjab lasso which i had been dread all the even i wa
convinc that thi rope had alreadi done duti for joseph buquet who
like myself must have caught erik on even work the stone in the
third cellar he probabl tri it in hi turn fell into the
torturechamb and onli left it hang i can well imagin erik
drag the bodi in order to get rid of it to the scene from the roi
de lahor and hang it there as an exampl or to increas the
superstiti terror that wa to help him in guard the approach to
hi lair then upon reflect erik went back to fetch the punjab
lasso which is veri curious made out of catgut and which might have
set an examin magistr think thi explain the disappear
of the rope
and now i discov the lasso at our feet in the torturechamb
i am no coward but a cold sweat cover my forehead as i move
the littl red disk of my lantern over the wall
m de chagni notic it and ask
what is the matter sir
i made him a violent sign to be silent
1 an offici report from tonkin receiv in pari at the end of

togeth with hi men by our soldier and how all of them succeed
in escap thank to thi trick of the reed
2 daroga is persian for chief of polic
3 the persian might easili have admit that erik fate also
interest himself for he wa well awar that if the govern of
teheran had learn that erik wa still aliv it would have been all
up with the modest pension of the erstwhil daroga it is onli fair
howev to add that the persian had a nobl and gener heart and i
do not doubt for a moment that the catastroph which he fear for
other greatli occupi hi mind hi conduct throughout thi
busi prove it and is abov all prais
chapter xxii in the tortur chamber
the persian narr continu
we were in the middl of a littl sixcorn room the side of which
were cover with mirror from top to bottom in the corner we could
clearli see the join in the glass the segment intend to turn
on their gear ye i recogn them and i recogn the iron tree in
the corner at the bottom of on of those segment the iron tree
with it iron branch for the hang men
i seiz my companion arm the vicomt de chagni wa all aquiv
eager to shout to hi betroth that he wa bring her help i
fear that he would not be abl to contain himself
suddenli we heard a nois on our left it sound at first like a
door open and shut in the next room and then there wa a dull
moan i clutch m de chagni arm more firmli still and then we
distinctli heard these word
you must make your choic the wed mass or the requiem mass i
recogn the voic of the monster
there wa anoth moan follow by a long silenc
i wa persuad by now that the monster wa unawar of our presenc in
hi hous for otherwis he would certainli have manag not to let us
hear him he would onli have had to close the littl invis window
through which the torturelov look down into the torturechamb
besid i wa certain that if he had known of our presenc the
tortur would have begun at onc
the import thing wa not to let him know and i dread noth so
much as the impuls of the vicomt de chagni who want to rush
through the wall to christin daae whose moan we continu to hear
at interv
the requiem mass is not at all gai erik voic resum wherea
the wed massyou can take my word for iti magnific you
must take a resolut and know your own mind i cant go on live
like thi like a mole in a burrow don juan triumphant is finish
and now i want to live like everybodi els i want to have a wife like
everybodi els and to take her out on sundai i have invent a mask
that make me look like anybodi peopl will not even turn round in
the street you will be the happiest of women and we will sing all
by ourselv till we swoon awai with delight you ar cry you
ar afraid of me and yet i am not realli wick love me and you
shall see all i want wa to be love for myself if you love me i
should be as gentl as a lamb and you could do anyth with me that

soon the moan that accompani thi sort of love litani increas
and increas i have never heard anyth more despair and m de
chagni and i recogn that thi terribl lament came from erik
himself christin seem to be stand dumb with horror without the
strength to cry out while the monster wa on hi knee befor her
three time over erik fierc bewail hi fate
you dont love me you dont love me you dont love me
and then more gentli
why do you cry you know it give me pain to see you cry
a silenc
each silenc gave us fresh hope we said to ourselv
perhap he ha left christin behind the wall
and we thought onli of the possibl of warn christin daae of our
presenc unknown to the monster we were unabl to leav the
torturechamb now unless christin open the door to us and it wa
onli on thi condit that we could hope to help her for we did not
even know where the door might be
suddenli the silenc in the next room wa disturb by the ring of
an electr bell there wa a bound on the other side of the wall and
erik voic of thunder
somebodi ring walk in pleas
a sinist chuckl
who ha come bother now wait for me here i am go to tell
the siren to open the door
step move awai a door close i had no time to think of the fresh
horror that wa prepar i forgot that the monster wa onli go out
perhap to perpetr a fresh crime i understood but on thing
christin wa alon behind the wall
the vicomt de chagni wa alreadi call to her
christin christin
as we could hear what wa said in the next room there wa no reason
why my companion should not be heard in hi turn nevertheless the
viscount had to repeat hi cry time after time
at last a faint voic reach us
i am dream it said
christin christin it is i raoul
a silenc
but answer me christin in heaven name if you ar alon
answer me
then christin voic whisper raoul name
ye ye it is i it is not a dream christin trust me
we ar here to save you but be prudent when you hear the monster
warn us
then christin gave wai to fear she trembl lest erik should
discov where raoul wa hidden she told us in a few hurri word
that erik had gone quit mad with love and that he had decid to kill
everybodi and himself with everybodi if she did not consent to becom
hi wife he had given her till eleven oclock the next even for
reflect it wa the last respit she must choos as he said
between the wed mass and the requiem
and erik had then utter a phrase which christin did not quit
understand
ye or no if your answer is no everybodi will be dead and buri
but i understood the sentenc perfectli for it correspond in a
terribl manner with my own dread thought
can you tell us where erik is i ask
she repli that he must have left the hous
could you make sure
no i am fasten i can not stir a limb
when we heard thi m de chagni and i gave a yell of furi our
safeti the safeti of all three of us depend on the girl liberti
of movement
but where ar you ask christin there ar onli two door in my
room the louisphilipp room of which i told you raoul a door
through which erik come and goe and anoth which he ha never
open befor me and which he ha forbidden me ever to go through
becaus he sai it is the most danger of the door the door of the
torturechamb

by the effort she had made but i am fasten so tight oh the
wretch
and she gave a sob
where is the kei i ask sign to m de chagni not to speak and
to leav the busi to me for we had not a moment to lose
in the next room near the organ with anoth littl bronz kei
which he also forbad me to touch thei ar both in a littl leather
bag which he call the bag of life and death raoul raoul fly
everyth is mysteri and terribl here and erik will soon have
gone quit mad and you ar in the torturechamb go back by the

chapter xxiv barrel barrel ani barrel to sell
the persian narr continu
i have said that the room in which m le vicomt de chagni and i were
imprison wa a regular hexagon line entir with mirror plenti
of these room have been seen sinc mainli at exhibit thei ar
call palac of illus or some such name but the invent
belong entir to erik who built the first room of thi kind under
my ey at the time of the rosi hour of mazenderan a decor
object such as a column for instanc wa place in on of the
corner and immedi produc a hall of a thousand column for
thank to the mirror the real room wa multipli by six hexagon
room each of which in it turn wa multipli indefinit but
the littl sultana soon tire of thi infantil illus whereupon
erik alter hi invent into a torturechamb for the
architectur motiv place in on corner he substitut an iron tree
thi tree with it paint leav wa absolut true to life and wa
made of iron so as to resist all the attack of the patient who wa
lock into the torturechamb we shall see how the scene thu
obtain wa twice alter instantan into two success other
scene by mean of the automat rotat of the drum or roller in
the corner these were divid into three section fit into the
angl of the mirror and each support a decor scheme that came
into sight as the roller revolv upon it axi
the wall of thi strang room gave the patient noth to lai hold of
becaus apart from the solid decor object thei were simpli
furnish with mirror thick enough to withstand ani onslaught of the
victim who wa flung into the chamber emptyhand and barefoot
there wa no furnitur the ceil wa capabl of be lit up an
ingeni system of electr heat which ha sinc been imit
allow the temperatur of the wall and room to be increas at will
i am give all these detail of a perfectli natur invent
produc with a few paint branch the supernatur illus of an
equatori forest blaze under the tropic sun so that no on mai
doubt the present balanc of my brain or feel entitl to sai that i am
mad or ly or that i take him for a fool1
i now return to the fact where i left them when the ceil lit up
and the forest becam visibl around us the viscount stupefact
wa immens that impenetr forest with it innumer trunk and
branch threw him into a terribl state of constern he pass
hi hand over hi forehead as though to drive awai a dream hi ey
blink and for a moment he forgot to listen
i have alreadi said that the sight of the forest did not surpris me at
all and therefor i listen for the two of us to what wa happen
next door lastli my attent wa especi attract not so much
to the scene as to the mirror that produc it these mirror were
broken in part ye thei were mark and scratch thei had been
star in spite of their solid and thi prove to me that the
torturechamb in which we now were had alreadi serv a purpos
ye some wretch whose feet were not bare like those of the victim of
the rosi hour of mazenderan had certainli fallen into thi mortal
illus and mad with rage had kick against those mirror which
nevertheless continu to reflect hi agoni and the branch of the
tree on which he had put an end to hi own suffer wa arrang in
such a wai that befor dy he had seen for hi last consol a
thousand men writh in hi compani
ye joseph buquet had undoubtedli been through all thi were we to
die as he had done i did not think so for i knew that we had a few
hour befor us and that i could emploi them to better purpos than
joseph buquet wa abl to do after all i wa thoroughli acquaint
with most of erik trick and now or never wa the time to turn my
knowledg to account
to begin with i gave up everi idea of return to the passag that
had brought us to that accurs chamber i did not troubl about the
possibl of work the insid stone that close the passag and
thi for the simpl reason that to do so wa out of the question we
had drop from too great a height into the torturechamb there wa
no furnitur to help us reach that passag not even the branch of the
iron tree not even each other shoulder were of ani avail
there wa onli on possibl outlet that open into the
louisphilipp room in which erik and christin daae were but though
thi outlet look like an ordinari door on christin side it wa
absolut invis to us we must therefor try to open it without
even know where it wa
when i wa quit sure that there wa no hope for us from christin
daae side when i had heard the monster drag the poor girl from
the louisphilipp room lest she should interfer with our tortur i
resolv to set to work without delai
but i had first to calm m de chagni who wa alreadi walk about
like a madman utter incoher cri the snatch of convers
which he had caught between christin and the monster had contribut
not a littl to drive him besid himself add to that the shock of the
magic forest and the scorch heat which wa begin to make the
prespirations stream down hi templ and you will have no
difficulti in understand hi state of mind he shout christin
name brandish hi pistol knock hi forehead against the glass in
hi endeavor to run down the glade of the illus forest in short
the tortur wa begin to work it spell upon a brain unprepar for
it
i did my best to induc the poor viscount to listen to reason i made
him touch the mirror and the iron tree and the branch and explain
to him by optic law all the lumin imageri by which we were
surround and of which we need not allow ourselv to be the victim
like ordinari ignor peopl
we ar in a room a littl room that is what you must keep sai to
yourself and we shall leav the room as soon as we have found the
door
and i promis him that if he let me act without disturb me by
shout and walk up and down i would discov the trick of the
door in less than an hour time
then he lai flat on the floor as on doe in a wood and declar that
he would wait until i found the door of the forest as there wa
noth better to do and he ad that from where he wa the view
wa splendid the tortur wa work in spite of all that i had
said
myself forget the forest i tackl a glass panel and began to
finger it in everi direct hunt for the weak point on which to
press in order to turn the door in accord with erik system of
pivot thi weak point might be a mere speck on the glass no larger
than a pea under which the spring lai hidden i hunt and hunt i
felt as high as my hand could reach erik wa about the same height
as myself and i thought that he would not have place the spring higher
than suit hi statur
while grope over the success panel with the greatest care i
endeavor not to lose a minut for i wa feel more and more
overcom with the heat and we were liter roast in that blaze
forest
i had been work like thi for half an hour and had finish three
panel when as illluck would have it i turn round on hear a
mutter exclam from the viscount
i am stifl he said all those mirror ar send out an
infern heat do you think you will find that spring soon if you
ar much longer about it we shall be roast aliv
i wa not sorri to hear him talk like thi he had not said a word of
the forest and i hope that my companion reason would hold out some
time longer against the tortur but he ad
what consol me is that the monster ha given christin until eleven
tomorrow even if we cant get out of here and go to her
assist at least we shall be dead befor her then erik mass can
serv for all of us
and he gulp down a breath of hot air that nearli made him faint
as i had not the same desper reason as m le vicomt for accept
death i return after give him a word of encourag to my
panel but i had made the mistak of take a few step while speak
and in the tangl of the illus forest i wa no longer abl to find
my panel for certain i had to begin all over again at random
feel fumbl grope
now the fever laid hold of me in my turn for i found noth
absolut noth in the next room all wa silenc we were quit
lost in the forest without an outlet a compass a guid or anyth
oh i knew what await us if nobodi came to our aid or if i did
not find the spring but look as i might i found noth but
branch beauti branch that stood straight up befor me or
spread gracefulli over my head but thei gave no shade and thi wa
natur enough as we were in an equatori forest with the sun right
abov our head an african forest
m de chagni and i had repeatedli taken off our coat and put them on
again find at on time that thei made us feel still hotter and at
anoth that thei protect us against the heat i wa still make a
moral resist but m de chagni seem to me quit gone he
pretend that he had been walk in that forest for three dai and
night without stop look for christin daae from time to
time he thought he saw her behind the trunk of a tree or glide
between the branch and he call to her with word of supplic
that brought the tear to my ey and then at last
oh how thirsti i am he cri in deliri accent
i too wa thirsti my throat wa on fire and yet squat on the
floor i went on hunt hunt hunt for the spring of the
invis door especi as it wa danger to remain in the
forest as even drew nigh alreadi the shade of night were
begin to surround us it had happen veri quickli night fall
quickli in tropic countri suddenli with hardli ani twilight
now night in the forest of the equat is alwai danger
particularli when like ourselv on ha not the materi for a fire
to keep off the beast of prei i did inde try for a moment to break
off the branch which i would have lit with my dark lantern but i
knock myself also against the mirror and rememb in time that
we had onli imag of branch to do with
the heat did not go with the daylight on the contrari it wa now
still hotter under the blue rai of the moon i urg the viscount to
hold our weapon readi to fire and not to strai from camp while i went
on look for my spring
suddenli we heard a lion roar a few yard awai
oh whisper the viscount he is quit close dont you see
him there through the tree in that thicket if he roar
again i will fire
and the roar began again louder than befor and the viscount
fire but i do not think that he hit the lion onli he smash a
mirror as i perceiv the next morn at daybreak we must have
cover a good distanc dure the night for we suddenli found
ourselv on the edg of the desert an immens desert of sand stone
and rock it wa realli not worth while leav the forest to come
upon the desert tire out i flung myself down besid the viscount
for i had had enough of look for spring which i could not find
i wa quit surprisedand i said so to the viscountthat we had
encount no other danger anim dure the night usual
after the lion came the leopard and sometim the buzz of the tsets
fly these were easili obtain effect and i explain to m de
chagni that erik imit the roar of a lion on a long tabour or
timbrel with an asss skin at on end over thi skin he ti a
string of catgut which wa fasten at the middl to anoth similar
string pass through the whole length of the tabour erik had onli
to rub thi string with a glove smear with resin and accord to
the manner in which he rub it he imit to perfect the voic
of the lion or the leopard or even the buzz of the tsets fly
the idea that erik wa probabl in the room besid us work hi
trick made me suddenli resolv to enter into a parlei with him for we
must obvious give up all thought of take him by surpris and by
thi time he must be quit awar who were the occup of hi
torturechamb i call him erik erik
i shout as loudli as i could across the desert but there wa no
answer to my voic all around us lai the silenc and the bare
immens of that stoni desert what wa to becom of us in the midst
of that aw solitud
we were begin liter to die of heat hunger and thirst of
thirst especi at last i saw m de chagni rais himself on hi
elbow and point to a spot on the horizon he had discov an oasi
ye far in the distanc wa an oasi an oasi with limpid water
which reflect the iron tree tush it wa the scene of the
mirag i recogn it at onc the worst of the three no
on had been abl to fight against it no on i did my utmost to
keep my head and not to hope for water becaus i knew that if a man
hope for water the water that reflect the iron tree and if after
hope for water he struck against the mirror then there wa onli on
thing for him to do to hang himself on the iron tree
so i cri to m de chagni
it the mirag it the mirag dont believ in the water
it anoth trick of the mirror
then he flatli told me to shut up with my trick of the mirror my
spring my revolv door and my palac of illus he angrili
declar that i must be either blind or mad to imagin that all that
water flow over there among those splendid numberless tree wa
not real water and the desert wa real and so wa the
forest and it wa no us try to take him in he wa an old
experienc travel he had been all over the place
and he drag himself along sai water water
and hi mouth wa open as though he were drink
and my mouth wa open too as though i were drink
for we not onli saw the water but we heard it we heard it flow
we heard it rippl do you understand that word rippl it is
a sound which you hear with your tongu you put your tongu out
of your mouth to listen to it better
lastlyand thi wa the most pitiless tortur of allw heard the
rain and it wa not rain thi wa an infern invent oh i
knew well enough how erik obtain it he fill with littl stone a
veri long and narrow box broken up insid with wooden and metal
project the stone in fall struck against these project
and rebound from on to anoth and the result wa a seri of
patter sound that exactli imit a rainstorm
ah you should have seen us put out our tongu and drag
ourselv toward the rippl riverbank our ey and ear were full
of water but our tongu were hard and dry as horn
when we reach the mirror m de chagni lick it and i also
lick the glass
it wa burn hot
then we roll on the floor with a hoars cry of despair m de chagni
put the on pistol that wa still load to hi templ and i stare at
the punjab lasso at the foot of the iron tree i knew why the iron
tree had return in thi third chang of scene the iron tree
wa wait for me
but as i stare at the punjab lasso i saw a thing that made me start
so violent that m de chagni delai hi attempt at suicid i took
hi arm and then i caught the pistol from him and then i drag
myself on my knee toward what i had seen
i had discov near the punjab lasso in a groov in the floor a
blackhead nail of which i knew the us at last i had discov
the spring i felt the nail i lift a radiant face to m de
chagni the blackhead nail yield to my pressur
and then
and then we saw not a door open in the wall but a cellarflap
releas in the floor cool air came up to us from the black hole
below we stoop over that squar of dark as though over a limpid
well with our chin in the cool shade we drank it in and we bent
lower and lower over the trapdoor what could there be in that cellar
which open befor us water water to drink
i thrust my arm into the dark and came upon a stone and anoth
stone a staircas a dark staircas lead into the cellar
the viscount want to fling himself down the hole but i fear a
new trick of the monster stop him turn on my dark lantern and
went down first
the staircas wa a wind on and led down into pitchi dark but
oh how delici cool were the dark and the stair the lake
could not be far awai
we soon reach the bottom our ey were begin to accustom
themselv to the dark to distinguish shape around us circular
shape on which i turn the light of my lantern
barrel
we were in erik cellar it wa here that he must keep hi wine and
perhap hi drinkingwat i knew that erik wa a great lover of good
wine ah there wa plenti to drink here
m de chagni pat the round shape and kept on sai
barrel barrel what a lot of barrel
inde there wa quit a number of them symmetr arrang in two
row on on either side of us thei were small barrel and i thought
that erik must have select them of that size to facilit their
carriag to the hous on the lake
we examin them success to see if on of them had not a funnel
show that it had been tap at some time or anoth but all the
barrel were hermet close
then after half lift on to make sure it wa full we went on our
knee and with the blade of a small knife which i carri i prepar
to stave in the bunghol
at that moment i seem to hear come from veri far a sort of
monoton chant which i knew well from often hear it in the
street of pari
barrel barrel ani barrel to sell
my hand desist from it work m de chagni had also heard he said
that funni it sound as if the barrel were sing
the song wa renew farther awai
barrel barrel ani barrel to sell
oh i swear said the viscount that the tune di awai in the
barrel
we stood up and went to look behind the barrel
it insid said m de chagni it insid
but we heard noth there and were driven to accus the bad condit
of our sens and we return to the bunghol m de chagni put hi
two hand togeth underneath it and with a last effort i burst the
bung
what thi cri the viscount thi isnt water
the viscount put hi two full hand close to my lantern i stoop
to look and at onc threw awai the lantern with such violenc that
it broke and went out leav us in utter dark
what i had seen in m de chagni hand wa gunpowd
1 it is veri natur that at the time when the persian wa write
he should take so mani precaut against ani spirit of incredul on
the part of those who were like to read hi narr nowadai
when we have all seen thi sort of room hi precaut would be
superflu
chapter xxv the scorpion or the grasshopp which
the persian narr conclud
the discoveri flung us into a state of alarm that made us forget all
our past and present suffer we now knew all that the monster
meant to convei when he said to christin daae
ye or no if your answer is no everybodi will be dead and buri
ye buri under the ruin of the pari grand opera
the monster had given her until eleven oclock in the even he had
chosen hi time well there would be mani peopl mani member of the
human race up there in the resplend theater what finer retinu
could be expect for hi funer he would go down to the tomb
escort by the whitest shoulder in the world deck with the richest
jewel
eleven oclock tomorrow even
we were all to be blown up in the middl of the perform if
christin daae said no
eleven oclock tomorrow even
and what els could christin sai but no would she not prefer to
espous death itself rather than that live corps she did not know
that on her accept or refus depend the aw fate of mani

epilogu
i have now told the singular but veraci stori of the opera ghost
as i declar on the first page of thi work it is no longer possibl
to deni that erik realli live there ar todai so mani proof of hi
exist within the reach of everybodi that we can follow erik
action logic through the whole tragedi of the chagni
there is no need to repeat here how greatli the case excit the
capit the kidnap of the artist the death of the comt de
chagni under such except condit the disappear of hi
brother the drug of the gasman at the opera and of hi two
assist what tragedi what passion what crime had surround
the idyl of raoul and the sweet and charm christin what had
becom of that wonder mysteri artist of whom the world wa
never never to hear again she wa repres as the victim of a
rivalri between the two brother and nobodi suspect what had realli
happen nobodi understood that as raoul and christin had both
disappear both had withdrawn far from the world to enjoi a happi
which thei would not have care to make public after the inexplic
death of count philipp thei took the train on dai from the
northern railwai station of the world possibl i too shall take
the train at that station on dai and go and seek around thy lake o
norwai o silent scandinavia for the perhap still live trace of
raoul and christin and also of mamma valeriu who disappear at the
same time possibl some dai i shall hear the lone echo of
the north repeat the sing of her who knew the angel of music
long after the case wa pigeonhol by the unintellig care of m le
juge dinstruct faur the newspap made effort at interv to
fathom the mysteri on even paper alon which knew all the gossip
of the theater said
we recogn the touch of the opera ghost
and even that wa written by wai of ironi
the persian alon knew the whole truth and held the main proof which
came to him with the piou relic promis by the ghost it fell to my
lot to complet those proof with the aid of the daroga himself dai
by dai i kept him inform of the progress of my inquiri and he
direct them he had not been to the opera for year and year but
he had preserv the most accur recollect of the build and
there wa no better guid than he possibl to help me discov it most
secret recess he also told me where to gather further inform
whom to ask and he sent me to call on m poligni at a moment when the
poor man wa nearli draw hi last breath i had no idea that he wa
so veri ill and i shall never forget the effect which my question
about the ghost produc upon him he look at me as if i were the
devil and answer onli in a few incoher sentenc which show
howeverand that wa the main thingth extent of the perturb
which o g in hi time had brought into that alreadi veri restless
life for m poligni wa what peopl call a man of pleasur
when i came and told the persian of the poor result of my visit to m
poligni the daroga gave a faint smile and said
poligni never knew how far that extraordinari blackguard of an erik
humbug himth persian by the wai spoke of erik sometim as a
demigod and sometim as the lowest of the lowpoligni wa
superstiti and erik knew it erik knew most thing about the public
and privat affair of the opera when m poligni heard a mysteri
voic tell him in box five of the manner in which he us to spend
hi time and abus hi partner confid he did not wait to hear
ani more think at first that it wa a voic from heaven he
believ himself damn and then when the voic began to ask for
monei he saw that he wa be victim by a shrewd blackmail to
whom debienn himself had fallen a prei both of them alreadi tire
of manag for variou reason went awai without try to
investig further into the person of that curiou o g who had
forc such a singular memorandumbook upon them thei bequeath the
whole mysteri to their successor and heav a sigh of relief when thei
were rid of a busi that had puzzl them without amus them in
the least
i then spoke of the two successor and express my surpris that in
hi memoir of a manag m moncharmin should describ the opera
ghost behavior at such length in the first part of the book and
hardli mention it at all in the second in repli to thi the persian
who knew the memoir as thoroughli as if he had written them himself
observ that i should find the explan of the whole busi if i
would just recollect the few line which moncharmin devot to the
ghost in the second part aforesaid i quot these line which ar
particularli interest becaus thei describ the veri simpl manner
in which the famou incid of the twentythousand franc wa close
as for o g some of whose curiou trick i have relat in the first
part of my memoir i will onli sai that he redeem by on spontan
fine action all the worri which he had caus my dear friend and
partner and i am bound to sai myself he felt no doubt that there
ar limit to a joke especi when it is so expens and when the
commissari of polic ha been inform for at the moment when we had
made an appoint in our offic with m mifroid to tell him the whole
stori a few dai after the disappear of christin daae we found
on richard tabl a larg envelop inscrib in red ink with o
gs compliment it contain the larg sum of monei which he had
succeed in playfulli extract for the time be from the
treasuri richard wa at onc of the opinion that we must be content
with that and drop the busi i agre with richard all well
that end well what do you sai o g
of cours moncharmin especi after the monei had been restor
continu to believ that he had for a short while been the butt of
richard sens of humor wherea richard on hi side wa convinc
that moncharmin had amus himself by invent the whole of the affair
of the opera ghost in order to reveng himself for a few joke
i ask the persian to tell me by what trick the ghost had taken
twentythousand franc from richard pocket in spite of the
safetypin he repli that he had not gone into thi littl detail
but that if i myself care to make an investig on the spot i
should certainli find the solut to the riddl in the manag
offic by rememb that erik had not been nicknam the trapdoor
lover for noth i promis the persian to do so as soon as i had
time and i mai as well tell the reader at onc that the result of my
investig were perfectli satisfactori and i hardli believ that i
should ever discov so mani undeni proof of the authent of
the feat ascrib to the ghost
the persian manuscript christin daae paper the statement made
to me by the peopl who us to work under mm richard and moncharmin
by littl meg herself the worthi madam giri i am sorri to sai is no
more and by sorelli who is now live in retir at louvecienn
all the document relat to the exist of the ghost which i
propos to deposit in the archiv of the opera have been check and
confirm by a number of import discoveri of which i am justli
proud i have not been abl to find the hous on the lake erik have
block up all the secret entrances1 on the other hand i have
discov the secret passag of the communist the plank of which
is fall to piec in part and also the trapdoor through which
raoul and the persian penetr into the cellar of the operahous
in the communist dungeon i notic number of initi trace on the
wall by the unfortun peopl confin in it and among these were an
r and a c r c raoul de chagni the letter ar there to thi
dai
if the reader will visit the opera on morn and ask leav to stroll
where he pleas without be accompani by a stupid guid let him
go to box five and knock with hi fist or stick on the enorm column
that separ thi from the stagebox he will find that the column
sound hollow after that do not be astonish by the suggest that
it wa occupi by the voic of the ghost there is room insid the
column for two men if you ar surpris that when the variou
incid occur no on turn round to look at the column you must
rememb that it present the appear of solid marbl and that the
voic contain in it seem rather to come from the opposit side
for as we have seen the ghost wa an expert ventriloquist
the column wa elabor carv and decor with the sculptor
chisel and i do not despair of on dai discov the ornament that
could be rais or lower at will so as to admit of the ghost
mysteri correspond with mme giri and of hi generos
howev all these discoveri ar noth to my mind compar with
that which i wa abl to make in the presenc of the actingmanag
in the manag offic within a coupl of inch from the deskchair
and which consist of a trapdoor the width of a board in the
floor and the length of a man forearm and no longer a trapdoor
that fall back like the lid of a box a trapdoor through which i can
see a hand come and dexter fumbl at the pocket of a swallowtail
coat
that is the wai the fortythousand franc went and that also is
the wai by which through some trick or other thei were return
speak about thi to the persian i said
so we mai take it as the fortythousand franc were return that
erik wa simpli amus himself with that memorandumbook of hi
dont you believ it he repli erik want monei think
himself without the pale of human he wa restrain by no scrupl
and he emploi hi extraordinari gift of dexter and imagin
which he had receiv by wai of compens for hi extraordinari
uglinesss to prei upon hi fellowmen hi reason for restor the
fortythousand franc of hi own accord wa that he no longer want
it he had relinquish hi marriag with christin daae he had
relinquish everyth abov the surfac of the earth
accord to the persian account erik wa born in a small town not
far from rouen he wa the son of a mastermason he ran awai at an
earli ag from hi father hous where hi ugli wa a subject of
horror and terror to hi parent for a time he frequent the fair
where a showman exhibit him as the live corps he seem to have
cross the whole of europ from fair to fair and to have complet
hi strang educ as an artist and magician at the veri
fountainhead of art and magic among the gipsi a period of erik
life remain quit obscur he wa seen at the fair of
nijninovgorod where he displai himself in all hi hideou glori
he alreadi sang as nobodi on thi earth had ever sung befor he
practis ventriloqu and gave displai of legerdemain so
extraordinari that the caravan return to asia talk about it
dure the whole length of their journei in thi wai hi reput
penetr the wall of the palac at mazenderan where the littl
sultana the favorit of the shahinshah wa bore herself to death
a dealer in fur return to samarkand from nijninovgorod told of
the marvel which he had seen perform in erik tent the trader wa
summon to the palac and the daroga of mazenderan wa told to
question him next the daroga wa instruct to go and find erik he
brought him to persia where for some month erik will wa law he
wa guilti of not a few horror for he seem not to know the
differ between good and evil he took part calmli in a number of
polit assassin and he turn hi diabol invent power
against the emir of afghanistan who wa at war with the persian
empir the shah took a like to him
thi wa the time of the rosi hour of mazenderan of which the
daroga narr ha given us a glimps erik had veri origin
idea on the subject of architectur and thought out a palac much as a
conjuror contriv a trickcasket the shah order him to construct an
edific of thi kind erik did so and the build appear to have
been so ingeni that hi majesti wa abl to move about in it unseen
and to disappear without a possibl of the trick be discov
when the shahinshah found himself the possessor of thi gem he
order erik yellow ey to be put out but he reflect that even
when blind erik would still be abl to build so remark a hous for
anoth sovereign and also that as long as erik wa aliv some on
would know the secret of the wonder palac erik death wa
decid upon togeth with that of all the labor who had work
under hi order the execut of thi abomin decre devolv
upon the daroga of mazenderan erik had shown him some slight servic
and procur him mani a hearti laugh he save erik by provid him
with the mean of escap but nearli paid with hi head for hi
gener indulg
fortun for the daroga a corps halfeaten by the bird of prei
wa found on the shore of the caspian sea and wa taken for erik
bodi becaus the daroga friend had dress the remain in cloth
that belong to erik the daroga wa let off with the loss of the
imperi favor the confisc of hi properti and an order of
perpetu banish as a member of the royal hous howev he
continu to receiv a monthli pension of a few hundr franc from the
persian treasuri and on thi he came to live in pari
as for erik he went to asia minor and thenc to constantinopl where
he enter the sultan employ in explan of the servic
which he wa abl to render a monarch haunt by perpetu terror i
need onli sai that it wa erik who construct all the famou
trapdoor and secret chamber and mysteri strongbox which were
found at yildizkiosk after the last turkish revolut he also
invent those automata dress like the sultan and resembl the
sultan in all respects2 which made peopl believ that the
command of the faith wa awak at on place when in realiti he
wa asleep elsewher
of cours he had to leav the sultan servic for the same reason
that made him fly from persia he knew too much then tire of hi
adventur formid and monstrou life he long to be some on
like everybodi els and he becam a contractor like ani ordinari
contractor build ordinari hous with ordinari brick he tender
for part of the foundat in the opera hi estim wa accept
when he found himself in the cellar of the enorm playhous hi
artist fantast wizard natur resum the upper hand besid
wa he not as ugli as ever he dream of creat for hi own us a
dwell unknown to the rest of the earth where he could hide from
men ey for all time
the reader know and guess the rest it is all in keep with thi
incred and yet veraci stori poor unhappi erik shall we piti
him shall we curs him he ask onli to be some on like
everybodi els but he wa too ugli and he had to hide hi geniu or
us it to plai trick with when with an ordinari face he would have
been on of the most distinguish of mankind he had a heart that
could have held the empir of the world and in the end he had to
content himself with a cellar ah ye we must need piti the opera
ghost
i have prai over hi mortal remain that god might show him merci
notwithstand hi crime ye i am sure quit sure that i prai
besid hi bodi the other dai when thei took it from the spot where
thei were buri the phonograph record it wa hi skeleton i
did not recogn it by the ugli of the head for all men ar ugli
when thei have been dead as long as that but by the plain gold ring
which he wore and which christin daae had certainli slip on hi
finger when she came to buri him in accord with her promis
the skeleton wa ly near the littl well in the place where the
angel of music first held christin daae faint in hi trembl
arm on the night when he carri her down to the cellar of the
operahous
and now what do thei mean to do with that skeleton sure thei will
not buri it in the common grave i sai that the place of the
skeleton of the opera ghost is in the archiv of the nation academi
