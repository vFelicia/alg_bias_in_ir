glassblow is neither veri easi nor veri difficult there ar
oper so easi that the youngest laboratori boi should be abl to
repeat them successfulli after onc have been shown the wai there ar
oper so difficult that year ar need to train ey and hand and
judgment to carri them out but the greater number of scientif need
lie between these two extrem yet a surprisingli larg number of
scientif worker fail even to join a glass tube or make a t piec that
will not crack spontan and the fault is rather on of
understand than of lack of abil to carri out the necessari
manipul
in follow the scheme of instruct adopt in thi handbook it will
be well for the student to pai particular attent to the reason given
for each detail of the desir procedur and as far as mai be to
memoris it onc have master the underli reason he can evolv
scheme of manipul to suit hi own particular need although as a
rule those given in the follow page will be found to embodi the
result of mani year experi
there is a wide choic of apparatu from a simpl mouthblowpip and a
candl flame to a powerdriven blower and a multiplejet heat devic
all ar us and all have their special applic but for the
present we will consid the ordinari type of bellow and blowpip
such as on usual find in a chemic or physic laboratori
the usual or herepath type of ga blowpip consist of an outer tube
through which coal ga can be pass and an inner tube through which a
stream of air mai be blown such a blowpip is shown in section by fig
1 it is desir to have the three centr screw as shown in order
to adjust the posit of the air jet and obtain a wellshap flame
but these screw ar sometim omit fig 1 a and b show the
effect of defect centr of the air jet c show the effect of
dirt or rough in the insid of the air jet d show a satisfactori
flame
illustr fig 1
for mani purpos it is an advantag to have what is sometim known
as a quickchang blowpip that is on in which jet of vari size
mai be brought into posit without stop the work for more than a
fraction of a second such a devic is made by messr letcher and is
shown by e and in section by f fig 1 it is onli necessari to
rotat the desir jet into posit in order to connect it with both
ga and air suppli a small byepass ignit the ga and adjust
of ga and air mai be made by a partial rotat of the cylind which
carri the jet
for special heavi work where it is need to heat a larg mass of
glass a multipl blowpip jet of the pattern invent by my father
thoma bola as the result of a suggest deriv from a studi of the
jet us in griffin ga furnac is of consider valu thi jet
consist of a block of metal in which ar drill seven hole on be
central and the other six arrang in a close circl around the central
hole to each of these hole is a commun wai lead to the ga
suppli and an air jet is arrang central in each each hole ha also
an extens tube fit into it the whole effect be that of seven
blowpip in order to provid a final adjust for the flame a
perfor plate have seven hole which correspond in size and
posit to the outer tube is arrang to slide on parallel guid in
front of these outer tube
illustr fig 2
the next piec of apparatu for consider is the bellow of which
there ar three or more type on the market although all consist of two
essenti part the blower or bellow proper and the wind chamber or
reservoir two pattern ar shown in fig 2 a is the form which is
commonli us by jewel and metal worker to suppli the air blast
necessari for heat small furnac such a bellow mai be obtain at
almost ani jewel suppli dealer in clerkenwel but it not
infrequ happen that the spring in the wind chamber is too strong
for glassblow and henc the air suppli tend to vari in pressur
thi can be improv by fit a weaker spring but an easier wai and
on that usual give fairli satisfactori result is to place an
ordinari screwclip on the rubber tube lead from the bellow to the
blowpip and to tighten thi until an even blast is obtain
anoth form of bellow made by messr fletcher and co and common in
most laboratori is shown by b the wind chamber consist of a disc
of indiarubb clamp under a circular frame or ti on to a circular
rim thi form is shown by fig 2 b
the third form and on which my own experi ha caus me to prefer
to ani other is cylindr and stand insid the pedest of the
blowpipet a blowpipet of thi descript is made by enfer of
pari
there is no need howev to purchas an expens tabl for laboratori
us all the work describ in thi book can quit well be done with a
simpl foot bellow and a quickchang blowpip nearli all of it can be
done with a singl jet blowpip such as that describ first or even
with the still simpler apparatu mention on page 84 but i do not
advis the beginn to practis with quit so simpl a form at first
and for that reason have postpon a descript of it until the last
chapter
glassblow tool and applianc ar mani and variou quit a number
of them ar better reject than us but there ar a few essenti
these arefil glassknif small turnpin larg turnpin carbon
cone carbon plate rubber tube of small diamet variou size of
cork and an asbesto heat reflector for ordinari work an anneal
oven is not necessari but on is describ on page 60 in connect
with the special case where anneal is desir
fig 3 illustr the tool and applianc a is an end view of the
desir form of file and show the best method of grind the edg
in order to obtain a highli satisfactori tool b is a glass knife
shown both in perspect and end view it is made of glasshard steel
and should be sharpen on a rough stone such as a scytheston in
order to give a slightli irregular edg c is a small turnpin which
mai be made by flatten and file the end of a sixinch nail d is
the larg turnpin and consist of a polish iron spike about five
inch long and a quarter of an inch diamet at it largest part thi
should be mount in a wooden handl e and f ar carbon cone a
thin rubber tube is also us it mai be attach to the work and
serv as a blow tube thu obviat the necess of move the work
to the mouth when intern air pressur is to be appli in order to
avoid undu repetit the us of these tool and applianc will be
describ as thei occur
illustr fig 3
glass as usual suppli by chemic apparatu dealer is of the
composit known as sodaglass thei also suppli hard or
combust glass but thi is onli us for special purpos as it is
too infus for conveni work in the ordinari blowpip flame
sodaglass consist primarili of silic of sodium with smaller
quantiti of silic of aluminum and potassium it exact composit
vari it is not blacken as lead glass is by exposur to the
reduc gase which ar present in the blue cone of a blowpip flame
and henc is easier for a beginn to work without produc
discolour
further note on glass will be found on page 55 but for ordinari
purpos sodaglass will probabl be us

glass
perhap the most common need of the glassblow whose work is connect
with that of the laboratori is for a seal tube and the seal of a
tube is an excel preliminari exercis in glassblow
we will assum that the student ha adjust the blowpip to give a
flame similar to that shown in d fig 1 and that he ha learn to
maintain a steadi blast of air with the bellow further we will assum
that the tube he wish to seal is of moder size sai not more than
half an inch in diamet and with wall of from onetenth to onefifth
of an inch thick
illustr fig 4
a conveni length of tube for the first trial is about on foot thi
should be cut off from the longer piec in which it is usual
suppli as followslai the tube on a flat surfac and make a deep
cut with the edg of a file do not saw the file to and fro over the
glass if the file edg ha been ground as shown in a fig 3 such a
procedur will be quit unnecessari and onli involv undu wear on
movement with suffici pressur to make the file bite will give a
deep cut now rotat the tube through about oneeighth of a turn and
make anoth cut in continu of the first take the tube in the
hand as shown in a fig 4 and appli pressur with the thumb at
the same time strain at the end the tube should break easili if it
doe not do not strain too hard as it mai shatter and caus seriou
injuri to the hand but repeat the oper with the file and so
deepen the origin cut in hold a tube for break it is
import to place the hand as shown in sketch as thi method is least
like to caus shatter and also minimis the risk of injuri even if
the tube should shatter to cut a larg tube or on have veri thick
wall it is better to avoid strain altogeth and to break by
appli a small bead of intens heat glass to the file cut if the
wall ar veri thin a glassblow knife should be us instead of a
file the tube and glassblow knife should be held in the hand and
the tube rotat against the edg of the knife thi will not produc a
deep cut but is less like to break the tube a bead of hot glass
should be us to complet the work
the next oper is to heat the glass tube in the middl thi must be
done gradual and evenli that is to sai the tube must be rotat
dure heat and held some consider distanc in front of the flame
at first otherwis the outer surfac of the glass will expand befor
the interior is affect and the tube will break from two to five
minut heat at a distanc of about eight inch in front of the
flame will be found suffici in most case and anoth minut should
be taken in bring the tube into the flame gradual heat is
import but even heat is still more import and thi can onli be
obtain by uniform and steadi rotat until the student can rotat a
tube steadili without think about it real progress in
glassblow is imposs
when the tube is in the flame it must be held just in front of the blue
cone and rotat until the glass is soft enough to permit the end to be
drawn apart continu to separ the end and at the same time move
the tube veri slightli along it own axi so that the flame tend to
plai a littl more on the thicker part than on the drawnout portion if
thi is done carefulli the drawnout portion can be separ off
leav onli a slight bleb on the portion it is desir to seal thi
is illustr by b fig 4
to convert the seal at b fig 4 into the ordinari form of testtub
seal it is onli necessari to heat the bleb a littl more strongli
blow gentli into the tube until the thick portion is slightli expand
reheat the whole of the round end until it is begin to collaps
and give a final shape by care blow after it ha commenc to
cool in each case the glass must be remov from the flame befor
blow the finish seal is shown by c fig 4 if desir the open
end mai now be finish by heat and rotat the soft glass against
the larg turnpin as illustr in d but the turnpin must not be
allow to becom too hot as if thi happen it will stick to the
glass after turn out the end the lip of glass must be heat to
red and allow to cool without come in contact with anyth
otherwis it will be in a condit of strain and liabl to crack
spontan the finish testtub is shown by e
when it is necessari to seal a substanc insid a glass tube the bottom
of the tube is first close as explain abov and allow to cool
the substanc if a solid is now introduc but should not come to
within less than two inch of the point where the second seal is to be
made if the substanc is a liquid it can more conveni be
introduc at a later stage
now bring the tube into the blowpip flame gradual and rotat it
while heat at the place where it is to be close allow the glass to
soften and commenc to run togeth until the diamet of the tube is
reduc to about half it origin size remov from the flame and draw
the end apart thi should give a long thick extens as shown by
f fig 4 if ani liquid is to be introduc it mai now be done by
insert a thin rubber or other tube through the open and run
the liquid in a glass tube should be us with caution for introduc
the liquid as ani hard substanc will tend to scratch the insid of the
glass and caus crack the final closur is made by melt the
drawnout extens in the blowpip flame the finish seal be shown
by g fig 4
if the seal tube ha to stand intern pressur it is desir to
allow the glass to thicken somewhat more befor draw out and the
bottom seal should also be made thicker for such a tube and especi
when it ha to stand heat as in a cariu determin of chlorin
each seal should be cool veri slowli by rotat it in a ga flame
until the surfac is cover with a thick layer of soot and it should
then be place asid in a posit where the hot glass will not come in
contact with anyth and where it will be screen from all draught
join tubew will now consid the variou form of join in glass
tube which ar met with in the laboratori first as be easiest we
will deal with the endtoend join of two tube of similar glass
a b and c fig 5 illustr thi on end of on of the tube
should be close a lip should be turn out on each of the end to be
join and both lip heat simultan until the glass is
thoroughli soft now bring the lip togeth gentli until thei ar in
contact at all point and there ar no place at which air can escap
remov from the flame and blow slowli and veri cautious until the
joint is expand as shown in b fig 5 reheat in the flame until
the glass ha run down to rather less than the origin diamet of the
tube and give a final shape by reblow the chief factor of
success in make such a join ar thorough heat of the glass befor
bring the two tube togeth and avoid of hard or sudden blow
when expand the joint the finish work is shown by c fig 5
illustr fig 5
to join a small glass tube to the end of a larg on the larg tube
should first be seal a small spot on the extrem end of the seal
heat and air pressur us to expand the heat spot as shown in d
thi expand spot is then reheat and blown out until it burst as
shown in e the thin fragment of glass ar remov and the end of the
small tube turn out as shown in f after thi the procedur is
similar to that us in joint two tube of equal size
when these two form of joint have been master a t piec will present
but littl difficulti it is made in three stage as shown in fig 5
and the procedur is similar to that us in join a larg and small
tube care should be taken to avoid soften the top of the t too
much or the glass will bend and distort the finish work although a
slight bend can be rectifi by reheat and bend back local
reheat is often us in give the joint it final shape
an exhaust branch is often made by a total differ method thi
method is shown by g h and i fig 5 g is the tube on which
the branch is to be made the end of a rod of similar glass should be
heat until a mass of thoroughli liquid glass ha collect as shown
and at the same time a spot should be heat on that part of the tube
where it is desir to make the branch the mass of hot glass on the rod
is now brought in contact with the heat spot on the tube and expand
by blow as shown by h the air pressur in the tube is still
maintain while the rod is drawn awai as shown by i thi will give a
hollow branch which mai be cut off at ani desir point and is then
readi for connect to the vacuum pump
if the rod us is of a dissimilar glass the branch should be blown
much thinner such a branch will often serv as a us basi for
join two tube of differ composit as the ordinari type of
branch is more liabl to crack when made with two glass have
differ coeffici of expans
blow bulbsa bulb mai be blown on a close tube such as that
shown by c fig 5 by rotat it in the blowpip flame until the end
is soften remov it from the flame and blow cautious it is
desir to continu the rotat dure blow in the case of a veri
small tube it is suffici to melt the end without previou seal
rotat it in the flame until enough glass ha collect remov from the
flame and blow while keep the tube in rotat
thermomet bulbsif the thermomet is to be fill with mercuri
it is desir to us a rubber bulb for blow as moistur is liabl
to condens insid the tube when the mouth is us and thi moistur
will caus the mercuri thread to break in ani case a slight pressur
should be maintain insid the thermomet tube while it is in the
flame otherwis the fine capillari tube will close and it will be veri
difficult to expand the heat glass into a bulb
larg bulbswhen a larg bulb is need on a small or medium size
tube it is often necessari to provid more glass than would be obtain
if the bulb were blown in the ordinari wai on method is to expand the
tube in success stage along it axi as shown by a fig 6 these
expand portion ar then reheat so that thei run togeth into on
hollow mass from which the bulb is blown b and c illustr thi
anoth method and on which is us for veri larg bulb is to
fuse on a length of larg thickwal tube the heat reflector
g fig 3 should be us if necessari when make larg bulb it
consist of a sheet of asbesto mount in a foot and is us by be
place close to the mass of glass on the side awai from the blowpip
flame while the glass is be heat
illustr fig 6
bulb of dissimilar glassthes mai be made by the second method
given under larg bulb but the joint should be blown as thin as
possibl further instruct in the us of unlik glass ar given on
page 94
a bulb in the middl of a tubeunless the bulb is to be quit small
it will be necessari to join in a piec of thick glass tube or to
draw the thin tube out from a larger piec thu leav a thick mass in
the middl as shown by d fig 6 thi mass of glass should now be
rotat in the blowpip flame until it is quit soft and on the point of
run togeth consider practic will be necessari befor the two
end of the tube can be rotat at the same speed and without
wobbl but thi power must be acquir when the glass is
thoroughli hot remov from the flame hold in a horizont posit
and expand by blow it is essenti to continu the rotat while
thi is done should on part of the bulb tend to expand more than the
other turn the expand part to the bottom paus for about a second
both in rotat and blow in order that the lower portion mai be
cool by ascend aircurr then continu blow and turn as
befor
absorpt bulb or wash bulbsthes ar made by an elabor
of the process given in the last paragraph g h and i fig 6

us of glass rodapart from it most common laboratori us for
stir glass rod mai be us in build up such articl as
insul feet for electr apparatu or acidresist cage for
chemic purpos such a cage is shown by f g and h fig 7
further by an elabor of the method of make an exhaust branch
given on page 18 blown articl mai also be construct from rod note
the ad part of e fig 9
a simpl footth form of foot shown by fig 7 k is easi to make
and ha mani us first join a glass rod to a length of glass tube as
shown the joint should be expand slightli by blow cut off the
tube and heat the piec remain on the rod until it can be turn out
as shown by i thi should be done with the larg turnpin and care
should be taken not to heat the support rod too strongli otherwis
the piec of tube will becom bent and distort it is better to
commenc by heat the edg of the piec of tube and turn out a lip
then extend the heat by degre and turn out more and more until the
foot look like that shown by i
we now need to make three project of glass rod these ar produc
as followsheat the end of the glass rod until a thoroughli melt
mass of glass ha accumul the rod must be rotat while thi is
be done otherwis the glass will drop off when suffici melt
glass ha been obtain the edg of the turnedout foot should be
heat to dull red over about onethird of it circumfer and
the melt glass on the rod should be drawn along the heat portion
until both ar so complet in contact as to form on mass of
semifluid glass the rod should now be drawn awai slowli and final
separ by melt off thu produc a flat project a repetit
of the process will give the other two project and the finish
foot mai be adjust to stand upright by heat the project
slightli and stand it on the carbon plate mention on page 7 after
the foot is adjust it should be anneal slightli by heat to just
below the soften point of the glass and then rotat in a smoki ga
flame until it is cover with a deposit of carbon after which it
should be allow to cool in a place free from draught and where the
hot glass will not come in contact with anyth the finish foot is
shown by k fig 7
build up from glass roda glass skeletonwork can be construct
from rod without much difficulti and is sometim us as a contain
for a substanc which ha to be treat with acid or for similar
purpos the method is almost suffici explain by the
illustr in fig 7 f show the initi stage g the method of
construct of the network and h the finish contain it is
conveni to introduc the substanc at the stage indic by g the
import point to observ in make thi contriv ar that the
glass rod must be kept hot by work while it is actual in the flame
and that the skeleton must be made as thin as possibl with the
avoid of heavi mass of glass at ani place if these detail ar
neglect it will be almost certain to crack
stirrersthes ar usual made from glass rod and no special
instruct ar necessari for their construct except that the glass
should be in a thoroughli fuse condit befor make ani join and
the finish join should be anneal slightli by cover with a deposit
of soot as explain on page 16 the flat end shown in a fig 8
ar made by squeez the soft glass rod between two piec of carbon
and should be reheat to dull red after shape fig 8 also show
variou form of stirrer
in order to carri out stir oper in the presenc of a ga or
mixtur of gase other than air some form of gland or seal mai be
necessari where the stirrer pass through the bear in which it run
a flask to which is fit a stirrer and ga seal is shown in section by
b fig 8 the liquid us in thi seal mai be mercuri petroleum or
ani other that the experiment condit indic
illustr fig 8
if the bear for a stirrer is made of glass tube it is desir to
lubric rather freeli otherwis heat will be produc by the
friction of the stirrer and the tube will probabl crack such
lubric mai be suppli by turn out the top of the bear tube
and fill the turnedout portion with petroleum jelli mix with a
small quantiti of fine ground or better colloid graphit and the
bear should also be lubric with the same composit care
should be taken not to emploi so soft a lubric or so larg an excess
as to caus it to run down the stirrer into the liquid which is be
stir
lead a crackit sometim happen that a larg bulb or special
thinwal tube ha to be divid in such a case it is scarc
practic to us the method recommend for small tube on page 12
but it is quit easi to lead a crack in ani desir direct a
conveni start point is a file cut thi is touch with hot glass
until a crack is initi a small flame or a bead of hot glass is now
us to heat the articl at a point about a quarter of an inch from the
end of the crack and in whatev direct it ha to be led the crack
will now extend toward the sourc of heat which should be move
farther awai as the crack advanc in thi manner a crack mai be caus
to take ani desir path and can be led round a larg bulb
cut glass with the diamondslip of windowglass can be us in
place of glass rod for some purpos and as cut them involv the
us of the glazier diamond or a wheelcutt thei mai well be
mention under thi head
in cut a sheet of glass with the diamond on need a flat surfac
on which to rest the glass and a rule against which to guid the
diamond the diamond should be held in an almost vertic posit and
drawn over the surfac of the glass with slight pressur while thi is
be done the angl of the diamond should be chang by bring the
top of the handl forward until the sound chang from on of scratch
to a clear sing note when thi happen the diamond is cut a few
trial will teach the student the correct angl for the diamond with
which he work and the glass if properli cut will break easili if
the cut fail it is better to turn the glass over and make a
correspond cut on the other side rather than make ani attempt to
improv the origin cut the diamond is seldom us for cut small
glass tube
the us of the wheelcutt call for no special mention as it will cut
at ani angl although the pressur requir is somewhat greater than
that need by most diamond

tube the two princip method of make such seal will be consid
first and their special applic afterward
an air trap on a baromet tubethi involv the us of the first
method and is perhap the simplest exampl that can be given fig 9
a a1 and a2 show the stage by which thi form of intern seal
is made for the first trial it is well to work with fairli
thickwal tube which should be cut into two piec each be
about eight inch long
illustr fig 9
first seal the end of on tube as describ on page 13 heat the seal
end and expand to a thick wall bulb fuse the end of the other tube
attach a piec of glass rod to serv as a handl and draw out cut off
the drawnout portion leav an end like a
now heat a small spot at the end of the bulb blow burst out and
remov the thin fragment of glass heat a zone on the other tube at the
point where the drawnout portion commenc and expand as shown by a1
the next stage is to join the tube heat the rag edg of the
burstout portion until thei ar thoroughli round at the same time
heat the drawnout tube to just below soften point then while the
round edg of the burstout portion ar still soft insert the other
tube rotat the join in the blowpip flame until it is quit soft and
expand by blow if necessari reheat and expand again the finish
seal which should be slightli anneal by smoke in a sooti flame is

a sprai arresterthi is made by the second method in which the
piec of tube which project insid the bulb is fuse in posit first
and the outer tube is then join on the variou stage of make ar
illustr by b b1 and b2 fig 9

exhaust branch describ on page 18 mai be us for the introduct
of an electrod it is conveni sometim to carri out the exhaust
through the same tube that will afterward serv for the electrod the
electrod wire is laid insid the branch befor connect to the
exhaust pump when exhaust is complet the tube is heat until
the soft glass flow round the platinum and make the seal airtight
the branch is now cut off close to the seal on the pump side a loop is
made in the project end of the platinum wire and the seal is
finish by melt the cutoff end
platinum is usual emploi for such work but if care is taken to
avoid oxid it is not imposs to make fairli satisfactori seal
with clean iron or nickel wire hard rod of fine graphit such as ar
us in some pencil mai also be seal into glass but it seem
probabl that air would diffus through the graphit in the cours of

thermometersapart from the note on page 20 with respect to the
blow of a suitabl bulb on capillari tube there is littl to sai in
connect with the glass work need in make a plain thermomet
the size desir for the bulb will be determin by the bore of the
capillari tube the coeffici of expans of the liquid us for
fill and the rang of temperatur for which the thermomet is
intend
fill mai be carri out as followsfit a small funnel to the open
end of the capillari by mean of a rubber tube and pour into the funnel
rather more than enough of the liquid to be us than is requir to
fill the bulb mercuri or alcohol will be us in practic most
probabl warm the bulb until a few air bubbl have escap through
the liquid and then allow to cool thi will suck a certain amount of
liquid into the bulb now heat the bulb again and at the same time heat
the capillari tube over a second burner the liquid will boil and sweep
out the residu air but it is necessari to heat the capillari tube as
well in order to prevent condens allow the bulb and tube to cool
then repeat the heat onc more by thi time the bulb and tube should
be free from air and cool should give a complet fill
thermomet remov the funnel and heat the thermomet to a few degre
abov the maximum temperatur for which it is to be us the mercuri or
other fill liquid will overflow from the top and as the temperatur
fall will reced thu allow the end of the capillari to be drawn
out reheat again until the liquid rise to the top of the tube then
seal by mean of the blowpip flame the thermomet is now finish

six combin maximum and minimum thermomet is shown by b fig 11
in thi case both maximum and minimum record ar obtain from a
mercuri column although the thermomet bulb is fill with alcohol it
is an advantag to make the dumbbellshap rod of iron as the
thermomet can then be reset by the us of a small magnet anoth
advantag consequ on the us of metal be that the rod can be
easili adjust by slight bend so as to remain stationari in the

the applianc necessari area blowpip capabl of give a
wellform flame of about six or eight inch in length a wheel of
from eighteen inch to three feet in diamet and have a flat rim of
about three inch wide and a devic for rotat the wheel at a speed
of about three hundr revolut per minut
a veri satisfactori arrang mai be made from an old bicycl the
back wheel have the tyre remov and a flat rim of tin fasten on in
it place the chain drive should be retain but on of the crank
remov and a handl substitut for the remain pedal the whole
devic is shown by fig 13
illustr fig 13
the procedur in spin glass is as followsfirst melt the end of
a glass rod and obtain a larg mass of thoroughli soften glass now
spin the wheel at such a speed that it own momentum will keep it
spin for sever second touch the end of the melt rod with
anoth piec of glass and without withdraw the origin rod from
the blowpip flame draw out a thread of molten glass and twist it round
the spin wheel if thi is done properli the thread of glass will
grip on the flat rim and by continu to turn the wheel by hand it is
possibl to draw out a continu thread from the melt rod which must
be advanc in the blowpip flame as it is drawn on the wheel if the
rod is not advanc suffici the thread will melt off if it is
advanc too much so as to heat the thick part and allow the glass to
becom too cool at the point of draw out then the thread will becom
too thick but it is easi after a littl practic to obtain the right
condit practic is necessari also in order to find the right speed
for the wheel
when suffici glass ha been spun the whole hank of thin thread
mai be remov by draw the thumbnail across the wheel at ani point
on it flat rim thu break the thread and allow the hank to
open
brush for us with strong acidsglass wool if of fine enough
textur to be highli flexibl can be us to make acidresist
brush a conveni method for mount the spun glass is to melt the
end of the thread togeth into a bead and then to fuse the bead on
to a rod thu give a brush if a point brush is necessari the
point mai be ground on an ordinari grindston or carborundum wheel by
press the loos end of the spun glass against the grind wheel with

not so easili soften or fuse as sodaglass and leadglass which is
less common there ar also resistanceglass made for us where veri
slight solubl in water or other solut is desir and a number
of other special glass but of these sodaglass combustionglass
leadglass and resistanceglass ar the most import to the
glassblow whose work is connect with laboratori need
sodaglassconsist chiefli of sodium silic but contain
smaller quantiti of aluminum silic and often of calcium silic
there mai also be trace of sever other compound
the ordinari sodaglass tube melt easili in the blowpip flame it
ha not a long intermedi or viscou stage dure fusion but becom
highli fluid rather suddenli it doe not blacken in the reduc flame
bad sodaglass or that which ha been kept for mani year tend to
devitrifi when work that is to sai the glass becom more or less
crystallin and infus while it is in the flame and in thi case it
is often imposs to do good work with that particular sampl of
glass although the devitrif mai sometim be remedi by heat
the devitrifi glass to a higher temperatur the presenc of aluminum
compound appear to have some influenc on the tendenc of the glass to
resist devitrif sodaglass as a rule is more liabl to crack
by sudden heat than leadglass and articl made from sodaglass
often tend to crack spontan if badli made or in the case of
heavier and thicker articl if insuffici anneal
combustionglassi usual a glass contain more calcium silic
and potassium silic than the ordinari soft sodaglass it is much
less fusibl than ordinari sodaglass and pass through a longer
intermedi or viscou stage when heat such a glass is not veri
suitabl for us with the blowpip ow to the difficulti experienc
in obtain a suffici high temperatur if howev a certain
amount of oxygen is mix with the air us in produc the blowpip
flame thi difficulti is minimis
resistanceglassmai contain zinc magnesium and other substanc
as a rule it is harder than ordinari sodaglass and less suitabl for
work in the blowpip flame it should have veri littl tendenc to
dissolv in water and henc is us when trace of alkali or silic
would prove injuri in the solut for which the glass vessel ar
to be us
leadglassthi or flint glass as it is often call from the
fact that silica in the form of crush and calcin flint wa often
us in make the english leadglass contain a consider

leadglass tube is easi to work in the blowpip flame melt easili
but doe not becom fluid quit so suddenli as most sodaglass
articl made from it ar remark stabl and free from tendenc to
spontan crack although as is essenti for all the heavi or
glasshous work the massiv articl need anneal in the oven
the two chief disadvantag of leadglass for laboratori work ar that
it is blacken by the reduc gase if held too near to the blue cone
of the blowpip flame and that it is rather easili attack by chemic
reagent thu ammonium sulphid will caus blacken
the effect of the reduc flame on lead is not altogeth a
disadvantag howev becaus a littl care in adjust the blowpip
and a littl care in hold the glass in the right posit will enabl
the student to work leadglass without produc the faintest trace of
blacken thi in addit to be a valuabl exercis in
manipul will teach him to keep hi blowpip in good order and
prove a us aid in hi earli effort to judg as to the condit of

annealingann is a process by which ani condit of strain
which ha been set up in a glass articl either by rapid cool of on
part while anoth part still remain hot or by the applic of
mechan stress after cool is reliev anneal is carri out by
subject the articl to a temperatur just below the soften point
of the glass maintain that temperatur until the whole articl ha
becom heat through the thicker part and then reduc the
temperatur veri gradual thu avoid ani mark cool of the
thinner and outer part first
for thin glass apparatu of the lampblown or blowpipemad varieti in
which there ar no mark differ of thick such as join on
tube ordinari seal bulb etc there is littl need for anneal
and even those have rather mark chang of thick such as
filter pump can be anneal suffici by take care that the last
step in make is heat to just below visibl red in the blowpip
flame and then rotat in a sooti ga flame until cover with a
deposit of carbon the articl should then be allow to cool in a place
free from draught and where the hot glass will not come in contact with
anyth
a few of the blowpipemad articl such for exampl as glass
stopcock need more care anneal and for thi purpos a small
sheetiron oven which can be heat to dull red over a collect of
ga burner will serv better still a small clai muffl can be us
in either case the articl to be anneal should be laid on a clean
smooth fireclai surfac the temperatur should be maintain at a veri
dull red for two or three hour and then reduc steadili until the oven
is cold thi cool should take anyth from three to twelv hour
accord to the natur of the articl to be anneal a thick articl
or on have great irregular in thick will need much longer
anneal than on thinner or more regular as a rule sodaglass will
need more anneal than leadglass
drill glasssmal hole mai be drill in glass by mean of a rod
of hard steel which ha been broken off thu give a more or less
irregular and crystallin end
there ar sever condit necessari to enabl the drill of small
hole to be carri out successfullyth first of these is that the
drill should be driven at a high speed thi mai be done by mean of a
gear handdril such as the american pattern drill although a
somewhat higher speed than thi will give is even more satisfactori the
second condit is that the pressur on the drill is neither too light
nor too heavi thi is conveni regul by hand the third
condit is that the drill be prevent from strai over the
surfac of the glass for thi purpos a small metal guid is us
the fourth condit is that a suitabl lubric be us a strong
solut of camphor in oil of turpentin is perhap the most suitabl
for commerci work a diamond drill is often us but thi is scarc
necessari for the occasion work of a laboratori
larger hole in glassth method of drill with a hard steel rod
is not highli satisfactori for anyth but small hole when a larger
hole sai on of an eighth of an inch or more is need it is better to
us a copper or brass tube thi tube mai be held in an american
handdril but a mixtur of carborundum or emeri and water is suppli
to the rotat end tube or drill must be lift at frequent interv
in order to allow a fresh suppli of the grind materi to reach the
end in thi case also a guid is quit essenti in the earli stage
of drill otherwis the end of the tube will strai the speed of
cut mai be increas slightli by make a number of radial slot in
the end of the tube these serv to hold a suppli of the grind
materi
grind lensesthi is scarc within the scope of a book on
glassblow for laboratori purpos but it mai be said that the len
mai be ground by mean of a permut mould of hard lead or
typemet the rough shape is done with coars carborundum or emeri
and success stage ar carri on with finer and finer materi the
last polish is by the us of jewel roug on the mould now
line with a fine textil
file glassif a new file thoroughli lubric with a solut of
camphor in oil of turpentin is us there is but littl difficulti in
file the softer glass a slow movement of the file without
excess pressur but without allow the file to slip is desir
after a time the cut edg of the file teeth will wear down and it
will be necessari to replac the file by anoth
grind stoppersthi is perhap the most common form of grind
that the laboratori worker will need to perform and for that reason
rather full detail of the procedur ar desir
a veri crude form of groundin stopper mai be made by draw out the
neck and the mass of glass which is intend to form the stopper to
approxim correspond angl wet the surfac with a mixtur
of the abras materi and water and grind the stopper in by hand
frequent lift of the stopper is necessari dure grind in order
to allow fresh suppli of abras materi to reach the contact when
an approxim fit is obtain the coars abras should be wash
off care be taken that the wash is complet and a finer abras
substitut after a while thi is replac in it turn by a still
finer grind materi
such a method of grind mai give a satisfactori stopper if the
angl of the plug and socket correspond veri close befor grind is
commenc but if there is a wide differ in the origin angl
then no amount of grind by thi method will produc a good result
the reason for thi is that the plug will becom so worn in the
preliminari grind as to assum the form of a highli truncat cone
the socket will assum a revers form and the end result will be a
loosefit plug and socket
satisfactori grind mai be carri out by the us of copper or
typemet cone for the preliminari shape such cone should be
mount on a mandrel which will fit into the chuck of the american
handdril and turn on the lath to the desir angl for
stopper a number of these cone will be necessari a number of
similar mould that is to sai block of typemet or hard lead in
which is a hole correspond in size and angl to the plug desir
should be made also these must be rotat either in the lath or by
other mean and ar us for the preliminari shape of the plug if
but few plug ar to be ground it is unnecessari to provid a mean of
rotat the mould as the plug mai be held in the hand and ground into
the mould in a manner similar to that us in the first method of
stopper
illustr fig 14
when the socket and plug have been ground by the success us of
cone and mould to the desir angl so that thei correspond almost
exactli the plug is given it final fit into the socket by
grindingin with a fine abras in the manner first describ
stopcocksalthough it would be more strictli in keep with the
form of thi book to divid the make of stopcock into two part
shape by heat and grind we will consid the whole oper here
and take for our exampl a simpl stopcock such as that illustr by
fig 14
the blank f that is the socket befor grind is made by draw
out a piec of fairli thickwal tube into the form shown by a
two zone on thi tube ar then heat by mean of a small point
flame and the tube is compress along it axi thu produc two
rais ring as shown by b two zone slightli toward the outer
side of these two rais ring ar heat and the tube is drawn while
air pressur is maintain within thi produc two thinwal bulb
or extens similar to those shown by c on of these extens is
now broken off by mean of a sharp blow with the edg of a file or
other piec of metal and the edg of the broken glass ar round in
the flame the other extens is left to serv as a handl we have now
a piec of glass like that shown by d now heat a spot on the side of
thi medial between the rais ring until the glass is on the point
of becom deform and bring the intens heat end of a smaller
tube in contact with the heat spot without disturb the rel
posit of the two tube press the smaller tube down on a thin steel
wire so that the wire pass along the tube and enter the soft glass
thu form a project insid the socket as shown by e the wire
must be withdrawn again immedi when the wire ha been withdrawn
heat the place where it enter to dull red in order to reliev ani
strain break off the thin extens which up to the present ha serv
as a handl round off the broken edg in the flame and join on and
indent a similar piec of small tube to the opposit side of the
socket the socket at thi stage be shown by f the blank for the
socket is now complet but it must be heat to dull red in order
to reliev strain and be place in an anneal oven where it should
be anneal for some hour
the blank for the plug offer no special difficulti it is made by
heat a glass rod and compress it axial until a mass have the
form shown by g fig 14 is produc the end of thi is heat
intens and brought in contact with the rather less heat side of a
glass tube which ha been drawn to the shape desir for the handl
when contact is made a slight air pressur is maintain in the glass
tube thu produc a hollow join the end of the tube ar seal and
the bottom of the plug is drawn off thu give the finish blank as
shown by h thi blank is now held in a pair of asbestoscov
tong heat to dull red all over and transfer to the anneal
oven
when cold the socket is ground out by the second method given under
grind stopper that is to sai by mean of typemet or copper
cone and the plug is ground to fit in a correspond mould when the
fit is almost perfect the transvers hole is drill in the plug and
the final finish is made with fine abras powder great care must
be taken in the final grind that there is no accumul of
abras materi in the transvers hole of the plug if thi is allow
to occur there will be a ring ground out of the socket where the hole
move and the tight of the finish stopcock will be lost
mark glassa a preliminari to a consider of the method of

the variou method which ar avail for mark glass among these
ar the write diamond the carborundum or abras pencil the
cuttingwheel and etch by mean of hydrofluor acid each produc
a differ class of mark and each is worthi of independ
consider
the write diamondthi is the name given to a small irregular
fragment of bort which is usual mount in a thin brass rod such a
diamond if properli select ha none of the characterist of a

diamond which will produc a definit cut these should be reject
the write diamond is us in much the same wai as a pencil but is
held more perpendicularli to the object and a certain amount of

although fairli definit lack breadth and thi is a disadvantag
where the mark ha to be read at a distanc thi disadvantag mai to
some extent be overcom by make a number of parallel scratch

etchingthi is often the quickest and easiest wai of mark glass
apparatu the object to be mark should first be warm and coat
veri thoroughli with a thin film of paraffin wax when cold the mark
is made through the paraffin wax by mean of a needl point and the
object is then expos to the action of hydrofluor acid if a shallow
but clearli visibl mark is desir it is well to us the vapour of
the acid thi mai be done by bend up a sheetlead trough on which
the object can rest with the mark surfac downward a littl of the
commerci hydrofluor acid or a mixtur of a fluorid and sulphur
acid is distribut over the bottom of the trough and the whole
arrang is allow to stand for about an hour the object is wash
thoroughli and the paraffin wax remov either by melt and wipe
off or by the us of a solvent and the mark is finish
if a deep mark is desir in order that it mai afterward be fill
with some pigment a better result is obtain by the us of liquid
commerci hydrofluor acid which is a solut of hydrogen fluorid
in water the acid is mop on to the object after the mark have
been made on the paraffin wax film and allow to remain in contact for
a few minut it is advantag to repeat the moppingon process at
interv dure the etch
in all case where hydrofluor acid is us or store it is of great
import to keep it well awai from ani optic instrument as the
most minut trace of vapour in the air will produc a highli destruct

method of calibrationin the case of apparatu for volumetr work
thi is usual carri out by weigh although some of the smaller
subdivis ar often made by measur when the subdivis ar
made in thi wai it is of import to see that the wall of the tube
or vessel to be calibr ar parallel great error aris in some of
the commerci apparatu from neglect of thi precaut a conveni
method of test for parallel in the case of a wide tube is to
close on end and to weigh in success quantiti of mercuri an
observ of the length occupi by each success quantiti will
indic ani chang in the bore in the case of capillari tube it is
conveni to introduc an unweigh quantiti of mercuri measur it
length accur and then to move it along the tube in stage either
by tilt the tube or by the applic of air pressur a measur
of the length at each stage will indic whether the bore is
approxim parallel or not neither of these method is to be reli
on without a care examin of the tube as it mai happen that
there ar local irregular in the bore which compens for each
other and do not therefor affect the volum of a given length
obvious the smaller the quantiti of mercuri with which the test is
carri out and the greater the number of observ made the less
risk will there be of such an error a liquid such as water or alcohol
which wet the glass is not suitabl for such a test unless special
precaut ar taken

be done by moisten the glass with platinum chlorid or silver nitrat
and then heat to red a layer of copper is then deposit
electrolyt on the treat surfac of the glass and solder is
carri out in the usual manner
mckelvi and taylor call attent to two other method in the journal
of the chemic societi for septemb 1920 in on of these method
the glass is coat with platinum by cover it with a suspens of
platinum chlorid in oil of lavend and heat until the oil is burnt
off the metal tube is then tin on it inner side and solder to the

extemporis glassblow apparatusth us of oil or
other fuelsmak small rod and tube from glass
scrapth examin of manufactur apparatu with the
view to discov the method us in manufacturesummari
of condit necessari for success glassblow
if in the earli stage of hi studi of glassblow the student
should attempt to work with the veri simplest applianc it is probabl
that hi progress will be hinder the us of the apparatu will
requir an undu amount of care and hi attent will be distract
from the actual manipul of the glass the case is wide differ
after he ha acquir a certain facil in glassblow
a simpl form of blowpipealthough there ar even more simpl form
than that describ here we ar not concern with them the form
describ is the simplest with which ani consider amount of
glassblow can be carri out with certainti
thi form consist of a tube through which air mai be blown with the
mouth a condens chamber in which ani moistur from the breath can
condens a blowpip jet a support piec and a sourc of flame
the tube condens chamber and jet ar combin in the ordinari
black blowpip such as is us for blowpip test in qualit
analysi it consist of a conic tin tube have a mouthpiec at the
small end and a side tube which carri a brass jet a support for such
a blowpip mai be cut out of a piec of brass or tinplat and should
be fasten to a small flat wooden board a sourc of flame mai
consist of an ordinari brass elbow such as is us on ga fit and
into which a piec of thin brass tube the bodi of a fishtail burner
from which the perfor nonmetal plug ha been remov will serv
quit well ha been fit it is an advantag to flatten the brass
tube somewhat and to file the flatten end to a slope which correspond
with the angl at which the blowpip jet enter the burner the whole
sourc of the flame should be mount on a separ base in order that
it mai be move while adjust the apparatu to the best rel
posit of flame and blowpip jet the complet apparatu is shown by
a fig 16
illustr fig 16
in order to take full advantag of thi blowpip it is desir that
the student should learn to maintain a steadi steam of air with hi
mouth and at the same time be abl to breath thi requir a littl
practic
as a first exercis in breath befor try to breath while us
the mouth blowpip the student should close hi mouth and inflat hi
cheek with air now still keep hi cheek tightli inflat he
should attempt to breath through the nose at first thi mai be found
rather difficult but it becom remark easi after a littl
practic when he ha master thi the student mai practis the same
oper but with the blowpip it is import to bear in mind that
the cheek not the lung form the reservoir for air us in
maintain the blowpip flame after a while the student will find
that he can maintain a steadi air pressur and yet breath with complet
comfort
in adjust the flame care should be taken not to blow so hard as to
produc a rag and noisi cone of fire a small jet such as that
commonli us on a mouth blowpip will with care give a point and
quiet flame have an appear similar to that shown in the
illustr
with a blowpip like thi it is quit easi to seal glass tube up to an
inch in diamet to join tube up to half an inch in diamet to bend
tube to blow small bulb and to make the simpler form of intern
seal but the provis for condens of moistur is not ideal and
prolong us of such a blowpip also tend to produc undu fatigu
a mouth blowpip with an expand reservoirthi form of blowpip
can be made to give most excel result it is highli portabl and
doe not produc nearli so much fatigu when us continu as the
blowpip describ in the last section variou slight modif
have been made in it construct dure the last eighti year but
that describ below will be found quit satisfactori
the apparatu consist of a tube through which air is blown from the
mouth a valv through which the air pass into an expand reservoir
and a blowpip jet in commun with the reservoir
in make the valv sever essenti have to be rememb it must
allow a free passag of air into the reservoir it must open easili and
must close quickli a satisfactori form of valv is that shown by b
fig 16 the move part consist of a light glass bulb of about
threeeight of an inch diamet and have a glass stem of rather under
oneeighth diamet and about an inch and a half long thi stem rest
in a guid at the end of a brass tube the bulb contact against the
other end which is approxim shape the bulb and it seat ar
ground airtight a veri light spring hold the bulb in posit
thi valv is fit into a metal or glass t piec on limb of which
lead to the air reservoir and the other limb lead to the blowpip jet
the limb contain the valv lead to the tube through which the air is
blown in
a conveni reservoir mai be made from a fairli larg footbal bladder
a network of string should be fit over the outsid of the bladder and
the string should termin in a hook on which a weight can be hung in
order to provid a mean of adjust the pressur at which the air is
deliv to the jet thi bladder should be wash out and allow to
drain after us
the air tube which pass from the valv to the mouth mai conveni
be made of brass but in order to avoid the continu contact of metal
with the lip of the oper it should be fit with a nonmetal
mouthpiec it is an advantag from the point of view of portabl to
have the air tube easili detach from the t piec contain the
valv
the blowpip jet of which there mai be sever with advantag mai be
made of glass tube bent to the most conveni angl and have an
enlarg or bulb at some point in the tube thi bulb serv as a
final condens place for ani trace of moistur that mai escap from
the larger reservoir
the whole devic blow tube reservoir and t piec mai be fasten
to a clamp so that it can be secur on the edg of ani tabl where
blowpip work is to be carri out if the blowpip is to be us with
ga the form of burner describ under a simpl form of blowpip
will be found quit satisfactori
the us of oil or other nongas fuelsalthough ga when
avail is usual prefer on account of it conveni there ar
sever other fuel which give a hotter flame thei have also the
addit advantag of not requir ani connect pipe but each ha
it own disadvantag
on liquid fuel deserv special mention as be rather less desir
than the other thi is alcohol although veri conveni in us it
ha the disadvantag of be rather too highli inflamm and capabl
of burn without a wick thu involv a certain fire risk the flame
is scarc visibl in a bright light and the heat given by either the
ordinari flame or the blowpip flame produc from alcohol is
consider less than that from a similar flame in which coal ga is
us for small work howev the facil with which a spirit lamp mai
be light mai more than counterbal these disadvantag at time
paraffin waxwher there is no coal ga avail and the blowpip
is onli requir at interv and especi where high portabl is
requir there ar few fuel so conveni as paraffin wax thi mai be
obtain in piec of a satisfactori size by cut paraffin candl
from which the wick ha been withdrawn into length of about half an
inch these cut piec have the advantag over ani oili fuel such as
colza oil that thei can be wrap in paper or carri in a cardboard
box further thei will keep indefinit even in the presenc of air
without undergo ani percept chang
form of lamp for paraffin waxprob the best form is that
devis by thoma bola and describ by him in the journal of the
societi of art decemb 2nd 1898 thi lamp consist of a small open
trai of iron through which pass three or more flat tube and between
these tube ar place small flat piec of wick the fit be such
that the piec of wick mai be adjust easili by mean of a pair of
point tweezer
the flame thu obtain instead of have on larg hollow is broken
or divid so that the combust is concentr into a smaller area
and the air blast which is direct across the flame carri the flame
with it in a more complet manner than is the case with the ordinari
flame a more thorough combust be realis by thi arrang
anoth advantag is the eas with which the wick mai be chang and a
larger or smaller wick insert to suit the flame to ani size of air
jet
thi form of lamp mai be us for oili fuel although it is special
suitabl for paraffin wax
two small piec of bent tinplat mai be us as side cover and these
serv to adjust the flame within certain limit a tinplat cover which
fit easili over the whole lamp serv as an extinguish the complet
lamp is shown by d fig 16 and thi figur show also a quickchang
airjet devic the whole arrang form a blowpip for us where a
nongas fuel is to be emploi
although the lamp just describ is desir when complet control over
the size of the flame is necessari and if the ideal condit and
maximum heat ar to be obtain yet a simpler form of lamp will be
found to give veri good result such a lamp mai consist of a flat tin
trai have a diamet of about three and a half inch and a depth of
about on inch in thi trai is a tin support for the wick and the wick
itself mai consist of a bundl of soft cotton for exampl a loos
roll piec of cotton cloth but in either case the top of the wick
should be cut to approxim the same angl as that at which the
blowpip jet meet the flame
in us paraffin wax as a fuel it is necessari to see that suffici
wax reach the wick to prevent char dure the first few minut
befor the bulk of the wax is melt
anim and veget oilsalmost ani oil mai be us as a fuel but
mani tend to becom hard and gummi if allow to stand in the air for
ani consider time when thi happen the wick becom clog and
it is imposs to obtain a good flame a number of the oil tend
also to produc rather strongli smell smoke
a flameguard for us with nongas fuelsin order to avoid the
eyestrain produc by the lumin base of the flame from a wick
burn paraffin wax or oil it is often advantag to make a small
tunnel of tinplat which can be rest on the side of the lamp and
rise over the top of the wick such a flame guard is shown by e fig
16
small rod and tube from glass scrapit is scarc practic to
make small quantiti of good glass with the blowpip flame as the onli
sourc of heat but it is less difficult to make small rod or tube
from glass scrap and the abil to do thi is sometim of
consider valu when a small tube ha to be join on to some special
piec of apparatu made of glass of unknown composit it mai be
possibl to obtain some fragment of similar glass either from a broken
part of the apparatu or from a similar piec and from these fragment
small tube or rod can be made
the fragment of glass mai be melt togeth on the end of a clai
pipestem care be taken to avoid trap air bubbl as fresh
fragment ar ad to the molten mass when a suffici quantiti of
glass ha been accumul the viscou mass mai be drawn out into a rod
by bring anoth pipestem into contact with the hot mass rotat
both pipestem steadili and separ them until a rod of the desir
size ha been obtain
if on the other hand it is desir to produc a tube from the mass of
heat glass the mass should be blown hollow befor the pipestem
support it ar separ
method of manufacturewhen the student ha familiaris himself
with the more common oper and process us in glassblow he
will be in a posit to increas hi skill and knowledg of special
method by a critic examin of variou exampl of commerci
work there ar few exercis more valuabl than such an examin
combin with an attempt to reconstruct the stage and the method by
which the articl chosen for examin wa made
obvious it is imposs to give full detail of all construct in
a small textbook but it is easi to give an exampl of the
construct method emploi in the make of almost ani piec of
light blownglass apparatu and these method should prove of special
valu when apparatu of a new pattern ha to be evolv for the purpos
of research that is to sai on design the apparatu requir appli
known method of construct as far as possibl and by the
examin of commerci apparatu have similar featur evolv the
new method requir for an exercis in such a process of
reconstruct we mai well take an ordinari commerci vacuum tube such
as that shown by a fig 17
illustr fig 17
in the tube from which thi draw wa made it wa found that the
spiral in the middl bulb wa of a slightli yellowish colour and gave a
green fluoresc when the electr discharg wa pass through the
tube that is to sai the spiral is made of uraniumglass which is
usual a sodaglass contain trace of uranium and henc differ
slightli in composit from the ordinari glass the two enclos
tube which ar bent into a seri of s bend gave a pink fluoresc
which indic leadglass and the remaind of the tube fluoresc
with an applegreen colour thi suggest ordinari sodaglass we have
therefor a piec of apparatu in which three dissimilar glass ar
join while at the same time that apparatu contain a number of
intern seal and it is not probabl that the dissimilar glass will
have their coeffici of expans so nearli alik as to permit of a
stabl intern seal be made if on part of the seal consist of a
glass differ from that of the other part
these consider lead us to a closer examin of the join where
the dissimilar glass ar introduc and we find that in no case is
the intern seal made between dissimilar glass but that a sodaglass
extens is join on to both the uraniumglass tube and the leadglass
tube at a point about half an inch befor the intern seal commenc
care examin of these join show that the chang from on glass
to anoth is not abrupt but gradual such a transit joint mai be
made by take a length of sodaglass tube seal the end and fuse
a minut bead of the other glass on to the seal end the end is then
expand and anoth bead of the other glass ad thi bead is
expand and the oper is repeat thu build up a tube and
final the tube of the other glass is join on to the end of thi
we ar now concern with the question of the insert of the
uraniumglass spiral into the bulb see p 38 obvious the spiral is
too larg to pass through the neck of the bulb and it is difficult to
imagin that the spiral wa obtain by the insert of a length of
straight tube which wa bent after enter the bulb therefor the
onli remain method is that the spiral wa made first and the
sodaglass extens fasten on and that the bulb wa blown cut in
halv and the spiral insert and the two halv were then rejoin
that thi wa actual the case is confirm by trace of a join which
ar just visibl round the middl of the bulb the insert of the
spiral and the make of the first intern seal ar shown by b and
c
there is on detail in make the second join of the spiral to the bulb
which call for attent and the small branch similar to an
exhaust branch at the side of the bulb provid a clue to thi if
an attempt were made to complet the second intern seal through a
close bulb it would be imposs to obtain a good result as the
airpressur in the bulb would not be under control when onc union wa
effect and further heat of the air in the bulb would caus
expans and perfor the wall near the second intern seal we
therefor make a small branch which can be left open and through which
such airpressur as mai be found necessari can be maintain
the third join by which the leadglass tube is join to the sodaglass
is made in stage similar to those in which the sodaglass and
uraniumglass were join but the intern seal is most conveni
made by slide a length of tube over the leadglass and fuse thi
tube to the larg diamet sodaglass tube to which the leadglass is
alreadi join the first stage of thi oper is illustr by d
when thi seal is complet the end of the sodaglass tube is drawn off
and seal as shown in e and at thi stage a side tube or branch is
join on the seal end of the outer and larg diamet sodaglass
tube is heat until it contract and fuse to the enlarg that ha
previous been join to the leadglass tube and the end is burst out
as shown in f anoth length of sodaglass is then join on to the
burstout end and thi length of sodaglass tube is drawn out to a
thinwal contract the noncontract part is expand to form the
bulb and a small exhaust branch made on the side the drawnout
portion be cut off and an electrod previous prepar by coat
a part of it length with a suitabl enamel is introduc the tube is
tilt to keep the electrod awai from the drawnout end which is
melt off and seal a small perfor is made with a hot platinum
or iron wire in the seal end the electrod is shaken into posit
and the seal is complet as explain on page 42
the remaind of the tube that is to sai the leadglass tube and the
bulb on the other side of the middl bulb is complet in a similar
manner
summari of condit necessari for success in glassblow
for the conveni of the student it mai be well to summaris the
chief essenti for success in glassblow and at the same time to
add such brief note on the variou method as mai seem desir
adjust of blowpipeth air jet should be clean intern and
so center as to give a flame have a welldefin blue portion the
tip of the flame should not be onli slightli lumin but purpl in
colour in the case of a blowpip burn oil or wax fuel the flame mai
be a trifl more rag without disadvantag
bellow and blowingth bellow should be adjust to deliv air at
constant pressur either by insert of a tap or better by attent
to the wind reservoir if necessari the movement of the foot in blow
should be steadi not jerki
heat glassth tube or rod should be heat cautious until it
ha reach it soften point in it thickest part steadi rotat of
the glass dure the heat is almost essenti
blow a bulb or expand a joinprolong heat is necessari in
order that the thick part mai be heat complet through blow
should take place by stage in order that the thin part which tend
to expand first have time to cool the thick part can then be expand
by further blow and thu a bulb or expans of even thick can be
obtain
cut glassth most us method for gener us is by mean of
the file or glassblow knife either file or knife must be kept
sharp by grind neither file nor knife should be us on hot glass
the diamond and wheel cutter ar us for cut sheetglass and
when the diamond is emploi a sing nois is an indic of a
satisfactori cut
lead a cracka crack mai be led in ani desir direct by mean
of a bead of hot glass or a small ga flame the glass which it is
desir to crack should be heat at a point slightli in advanc of the
crack which will extend in the direct of the sourc of the heat
turn out the end of a tubethi is done by heat the end of the
tube and rotat it against an iron rod the rod must be kept polish
and free from rust and it must not be allow to becom too hot while
in us otherwis the glass will stick to it
join unlik glassesjoint between unlik glass ar often
unstabl when such joint ar made it is desir to blow them as thin
as possibl and to avoid the junction of unlik glass in ani complex
joint such as an intern seal a transit portion of tube mai be
built up by the success addit and interfus of bead of on of
the glass to the end of a seal tube consist of the other glass
join a tube to a veri thin bulbth bulb mai be thicken at the
point of union by fuse on a bead of glass and expand thi slightli
a small central portion of the expand part mai then be perfor by
burst and the tube join on
insert of on bulb within anothera bulb mai be divid into two
halv by lead a crack round it and the inner bulb is then
introduc the two halv of the outer bulb mai be fit togeth
care be taken to avoid ani damag to the edg and the bulb mai be
complet by rotat the contact edg befor the blowpip until
thei ar soft and then expand slightli by mean of airpressur
annealingfor most purpos in the case of thin blowpipemad or
lampblown glass apparatu it is suffici to cool slowli by rotat
the finish articl over a smoki flame and set it asid in a place
free from draught and where the hot glass will not come in contact
with anyth
simpl bulb and joint do not even need thi smoke but thick
articl and especi those that ar to be subject to the stress of
grind need more prolong anneal in a special oven
us of leadglasswhen leadglass is to be us the blowpip flame
should be in good adjust and the glass should not be allow to
approach so near to the blue cone as to be blacken slight blacken
mai often be remov by heat the glass in the extrem end of the
flame
leadglass articl tend to be rather more stabl than similar articl
of sodaglass
combustionglassthi mai be work more easili if a small
percentag of oxygen is introduc into the air with which the blowpip
flame is produc if the air is replac entir by oxygen there is a
risk of damag the blowpip jet unless a special blowpip is
emploi
intern sealther ar two wai of make these on in which the
inner portion of the tube is fuse on to the insid of the bulb or tube
through which it is to pass an open is made by burst and the
outer tube is join on thi is a quick and in some wai more
satisfactori method than the other in which there is no separ inner
piec
rubber blow tubein complic work it is often conveni to
us a thin rubber blowingtub which is connect with the work either
by a cork and piec of glass tube or by fit over a drawnout end
the us of such a blowingtub avoid the inconveni of rais the
work to the mouth when intern airpressur is requir on end of the
rubber tube is retain in the mouth dure work
gener notesa larg amount of glassblow is spoil through
careless in arrang the work beforehand the student should have
everi detail of hi manipul clearli in mind befor he commenc the
work he should not trust to evolv the method dure the actual
manipul
undu hast is anoth fruit sourc of failur practic everi
oper in glassblow can be carri out in a perfectli leisur
manner and it is better to err rather on the side of deliber than
on the side of hast
if as will doubtless happen at time a piec of work give troubl and
it is necessari to paus and consid the whole question or if for ani
other reason it is necessari to stop dure the construct of a
partial finish join or other oper great care should be taken
not to allow the work to cool a larg brushlik flame mai be produc
by increas the amount of ga admit to the blowpip and the work
should be held just in front of the current of hot air produc by such
a flame
it will then be possibl to continu work on thi without caus it to
crack when further heat is appli
as time goe on the student will find an increas confid in hi
abil to manipul the soft glass and with increas confid
will come rapidli increas power of manipul perhap the greatest
obstacl to success in glassblow is undu hast in manipul
