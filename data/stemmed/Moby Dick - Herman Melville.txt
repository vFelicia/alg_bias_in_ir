satisfact of know that it is all right that everybodi els is
on wai or other serv in much the same wayeith in a physic or
metaphys point of view that is and so the univers thump is
pass round and all hand should rub each other shoulderblad
and be content
again i alwai go to sea as a sailor becaus thei make a point of
pai me for my troubl wherea thei never pai passeng a singl
penni that i ever heard of on the contrari passeng themselv must
pai and there is all the differ in the world between pai and
be paid the act of pai is perhap the most uncomfort

receiv monei is realli marvel consid that we so earnestli
believ monei to be the root of all earthli ill and that on no
account can a moni man enter heaven ah how cheerfulli we consign
ourselv to perdit
final i alwai go to sea as a sailor becaus of the wholesom
exercis and pure air of the forecastl deck for as in thi world
head wind ar far more preval than wind from astern that is if
you never violat the pythagorean maxim so for the most part the
commodor on the quarterdeck get hi atmospher at second hand from
the sailor on the forecastl he think he breath it first but not
so in much the same wai do the commonalti lead their leader in mani
other thing at the same time that the leader littl suspect it but
wherefor it wa that after have repeatedli smelt the sea as a
merchant sailor i should now take it into my head to go on a whale
voyag thi the invis polic offic of the fate who ha the
constant surveil of me and secretli dog me and influenc me in
some unaccount wayh can better answer than ani on els and
doubtless my go on thi whale voyag form part of the grand
programm of provid that wa drawn up a long time ago it came in
as a sort of brief interlud and solo between more extens
perform i take it that thi part of the bill must have run
someth like thi
grand contest elect for the presid of the unit state
whale voyag by on ishmael
bloodi battl in affghanistan
though i cannot tell why it wa exactli that those stage manag the
fate put me down for thi shabbi part of a whale voyag when
other were set down for magnific part in high tragedi and short
and easi part in genteel comedi and jolli part in farcesthough i
cannot tell why thi wa exactli yet now that i recal all the
circumst i think i can see a littl into the spring and motiv
which be cunningli present to me under variou disguis induc
me to set about perform the part i did besid cajol me into the
delus that it wa a choic result from my own unbias freewil
and discrimin judgment
chief among these motiv wa the overwhelm idea of the great whale
himself such a portent and mysteri monster rous all my
curios then the wild and distant sea where he roll hi island
bulk the undeliver nameless peril of the whale these with all
the attend marvel of a thousand patagonian sight and sound
help to swai me to my wish with other men perhap such thing
would not have been induc but as for me i am torment with an
everlast itch for thing remot i love to sail forbidden sea and
land on barbar coast not ignor what is good i am quick to
perceiv a horror and could still be social with itwould thei let
mesinc it is but well to be on friendli term with all the inmat of
the place on lodg in
by reason of these thing then the whale voyag wa welcom the
great floodgat of the wonderworld swung open and in the wild
conceit that swai me to my purpos two and two there float into
my inmost soul endless process of the whale and mid most of them
all on grand hood phantom like a snow hill in the air
chapter ii the carpetbag
i stuf a shirt or two into my old carpetbag tuck it under my
arm and start for cape horn and the pacif quit the good citi
of old manhatto i duli arriv in new bedford it wa on a saturdai
night in decemb much wa i disappoint upon learn that the
littl packet for nantucket had alreadi sail and that no wai of
reach that place would offer till the follow mondai
as most young candid for the pain and penalti of whale stop at
thi same new bedford thenc to embark on their voyag it mai as well
be relat that i for on had no idea of so do for my mind wa
made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft becaus there wa a
fine boister someth about everyth connect with that famou
old island which amazingli pleas me besid though new bedford ha
of late been gradual monopol the busi of whale and though
in thi matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her yet nantucket
wa her great originalth tyre of thi carthageth place where the
first dead american whale wa strand where els but from nantucket
did those aborigin whalemen the redmen first salli out in cano
to give chase to the leviathan and where but from nantucket too did
that first adventur littl sloop put forth partli laden with
import cobblestonesso goe the storyto throw at the whale in
order to discov when thei were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the
bowsprit
now have a night a dai and still anoth night follow befor me
in new bedford er i could embark for my destin port it becam a
matter of concern where i wa to eat and sleep meanwhil it wa a
veri dubiouslook nai a veri dark and dismal night bitingli cold
and cheerless i knew no on in the place with anxiou grapnel i had
sound my pocket and onli brought up a few piec of silverso
wherev you go ishmael said i to myself as i stood in the middl of
a dreari street shoulder my bag and compar the gloom toward the
north with the dark toward the southwherev in your wisdom you
mai conclud to lodg for the night my dear ishmael be sure to
inquir the price and dont be too particular
with halt step i pace the street and pass the sign of the
cross harpoonsbut it look too expens and jolli there further
on from the bright red window of the swordfish inn there came
such fervent rai that it seem to have melt the pack snow and
ic from befor the hous for everywher els the congeal frost lai
ten inch thick in a hard asphalt pavementrath weari for me
when i struck my foot against the flinti project becaus from
hard remorseless servic the sole of my boot were in a most
miser plight too expens and jolli again thought i paus on
moment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sound of
the tinkl glass within but go on ishmael said i at last dont
you hear get awai from befor the door your patch boot ar
stop the wai so on i went i now by instinct follow the street
that took me waterward for there doubtless were the cheapest if not
the cheeriest inn
such dreari street block of black not hous on either hand
and here and there a candl like a candl move about in a tomb at
thi hour of the night of the last dai of the week that quarter of
the town prove all but desert but present i came to a smoki light
proceed from a low wide build the door of which stood
invitingli open it had a careless look as if it were meant for the
us of the public so enter the first thing i did wa to stumbl
over an ashbox in the porch ha thought i ha as the fly
particl almost choke me ar these ash from that destroi citi
gomorrah but the cross harpoon and the swordfishthi then
must need be the sign of the trap howev i pick myself up and
hear a loud voic within push on and open a second interior
door
it seem the great black parliament sit in tophet a hundr black
face turn round in their row to peer and beyond a black angel of
doom wa beat a book in a pulpit it wa a negro church and the
preacher text wa about the black of dark and the weep
and wail and teethgnash there ha ishmael mutter i back
out wretch entertain at the sign of the trap
move on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the
dock and heard a forlorn creak in the air and look up saw a
swing sign over the door with a white paint upon it faintli
repres a tall straight jet of misti sprai and these word
underneathth spouterinnpet coffin
coffinspouterrath omin in that particular connexion thought
i but it is a common name in nantucket thei sai and i suppos thi
peter here is an emigr from there as the light look so dim and
the place for the time look quiet enough and the dilapid
littl wooden hous itself look as if it might have been cart here
from the ruin of some burnt district and as the swing sign had a
povertystricken sort of creak to it i thought that here wa the veri
spot for cheap lodg and the best of pea coffe
it wa a queer sort of placea gableend old hous on side palsi
as it were and lean over sadli it stood on a sharp bleak corner
where that tempestu wind euroclydon kept up a wors howl than
ever it did about poor paul toss craft euroclydon nevertheless
is a mighti pleasant zephyr to ani on indoor with hi feet on the
hob quietli toast for bed in judg of that tempestu wind
call euroclydon sai an old writerof whose work i possess the
onli copi extantit maketh a marvel differ whether thou
lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the
outsid or whether thou observest it from that sashless window where
the frost is on both side and of which the wight death is the onli
glazier true enough thought i as thi passag occur to my
mindold blacklett thou reasonest well ye these ey ar
window and thi bodi of mine is the hous what a piti thei didnt
stop up the chink and the cranni though and thrust in a littl lint
here and there but it too late to make ani improv now the
univers is finish the copeston is on and the chip were cart
off a million year ago poor lazaru there chatter hi teeth
against the curbston for hi pillow and shake off hi tatter with
hi shiver he might plug up both ear with rag and put a
corncob into hi mouth and yet that would not keep out the
tempestu euroclydon euroclydon sai old dive in hi red silken

now that lazaru should lie strand there on the curbston befor the

enter that gableend spouterinn you found yourself in a wide

upon enter the place i found a number of young seamen gather about
a tabl examin by a dim light diver specimen of skrimshand i
sought the landlord and tell him i desir to be accommod with
a room receiv for answer that hi hous wa fullnot a bed
unoccupi but avast he ad tap hi forehead you haint no
object to share a harpoon blanket have ye i spose you ar
goin a whalin so youd better get us to that sort of thing
i told him that i never like to sleep two in a bed that if i should
ever do so it would depend upon who the harpoon might be and that
if he the landlord realli had no other place for me and the
harpoon wa not decidedli objection why rather than wander
further about a strang town on so bitter a night i would put up with
the half of ani decent man blanket
i thought so all right take a seat suppery want supper supper
ll be readi directli
i sat down on an old wooden settl carv all over like a bench on the
batteri at on end a rumin tar wa still further adorn it with
hi jackknif stoop over and dilig work awai at the space
between hi leg he wa try hi hand at a ship under full sail but
he didnt make much headwai i thought
at last some four or five of us were summon to our meal in an
adjoin room it wa cold as icelandno fire at allth landlord said
he couldnt afford it noth but two dismal tallow candl each in a
wind sheet we were fain to button up our monkei jacket and hold
to our lip cup of scald tea with our half frozen finger but the
fare wa of the most substanti kindnot onli meat and potato but
dumpl good heaven dumpl for supper on young fellow in a
green box coat address himself to these dumpl in a most dire
manner
my boi said the landlord youll have the nightmar to a dead
sartainti
landlord i whisper that aint the harpoon is it
oh no said he look a sort of diabol funni the
harpoon is a dark complexion chap he never eat dumpl he
donth eat noth but steak and like em rare
the devil he doe sai i where is that harpoon is he here
hell be here afor long wa the answer
i could not help it but i began to feel suspici of thi dark
complexion harpoon at ani rate i made up my mind that if it so
turn out that we should sleep togeth he must undress and get into
bed befor i did
supper over the compani went back to the barroom when know not
what els to do with myself i resolv to spend the rest of the
even as a looker on
present a riot nois wa heard without start up the landlord
cri that the grampuss crew i seed her report in the of
thi morn a three year voyag and a full ship hurrah boi now
well have the latest new from the feege
a tramp of sea boot wa heard in the entri the door wa flung
open and in roll a wild set of marin enough envelop in their
shaggi watch coat and with their head muffl in woollen comfort
all bedarn and rag and their beard stiff with icicl thei
seem an erupt of bear from labrador thei had just land from
their boat and thi wa the first hous thei enter no wonder then
that thei made a straight wake for the whale mouthth barwhen the
wrinkl littl old jonah there offici soon pour them out
brimmer all round on complain of a bad cold in hi head upon
which jonah mix him a pitchlik potion of gin and molass which he
swore wa a sovereign cure for all cold and catarrh whatsoev never
mind of how long stand or whether caught off the coast of labrador
or on the weather side of an iceisland
the liquor soon mount into their head as it gener doe even
with the arrantest toper newli land from sea and thei began
caper about most obstreper
i observ howev that on of them held somewhat aloof and though
he seem desir not to spoil the hilar of hi shipmat by hi
own sober face yet upon the whole he refrain from make as much
nois as the rest thi man interest me at onc and sinc the
seagod had ordain that he should soon becom my shipmat though
but a sleepingpartn on so far as thi narr is concern i
will here ventur upon a littl descript of him he stood full six
feet in height with nobl shoulder and a chest like a cofferdam i
have seldom seen such brawn in a man hi face wa deepli brown and
burnt make hi white teeth dazzl by the contrast while in the
deep shadow of hi ey float some reminisc that did not seem
to give him much joi hi voic at onc announc that he wa a
southern and from hi fine statur i thought he must be on of
those tall mountain from the alleganian ridg in virginia when the
revelri of hi companion had mount to it height thi man slip
awai unobserv and i saw no more of him till he becam my comrad on
the sea in a few minut howev he wa miss by hi shipmat and
be it seem for some reason a huge favorit with them thei rais
a cry of bulkington bulkington where bulkington and dart out
of the hous in pursuit of him
it wa now about nine oclock and the room seem almost
supernatur quiet after these orgi i began to congratul myself
upon a littl plan that had occur to me just previou to the
entranc of the seamen
no man prefer to sleep two in a bed in fact you would a good deal
rather not sleep with your own brother i dont know how it is but
peopl like to be privat when thei ar sleep and when it come to
sleep with an unknown stranger in a strang inn in a strang town
and that stranger a harpoon then your object indefinit
multipli nor wa there ani earthli reason why i as a sailor should
sleep two in a bed more than anybodi els for sailor no more sleep
two in a bed at sea than bachelor king do ashor to be sure thei all
sleep togeth in on apart but you have your own hammock and
cover yourself with your own blanket and sleep in your own skin
the more i ponder over thi harpoon the more i abomin the
thought of sleep with him it wa fair to presum that be a
harpoon hi linen or woollen as the case might be would not be of
the tidiest certainli none of the finest i began to twitch all over
besid it wa get late and my decent harpoon ought to be home
and go bedward suppos now he should tumbl in upon me at
midnighthow could i tell from what vile hole he had been come
landlord iv chang my mind about that harpooneeri shant sleep
with him ill try the bench here
just as you pleas im sorri i cant spare ye a tablecloth for a
mattress and it a plagui rough board herefeel of the knot and
notch but wait a bit skrimshand iv got a carpent plane
there in the barwait i sai and ill make ye snug enough so sai
he procur the plane and with hi old silk handkerchief first dust
the bench vigor set to plane awai at my bed the while grin
like an ap the shave flew right and left till at last the
planeiron came bump against an indestruct knot the landlord wa
near sprain hi wrist and i told him for heaven sake to quitth
bed wa soft enough to suit me and i did not know how all the plane
in the world could make eider down of a pine plank so gather up the
shave with anoth grin and throw them into the great stove in
the middl of the room he went about hi busi and left me in a
brown studi
i now took the measur of the bench and found that it wa a foot too
short but that could be mend with a chair but it wa a foot too
narrow and the other bench in the room wa about four inch higher
than the plane oneso there wa no yoke them i then place the
first bench lengthwis along the onli clear space against the wall
leav a littl interv between for my back to settl down in but i
soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from
under the sill of the window that thi plan would never do at all
especi as anoth current from the ricketi door met the on from
the window and both togeth form a seri of small whirlwind in
the immedi vicin of the spot where i had thought to spend the
night
the devil fetch that harpoon thought i but stop couldnt i steal
a march on himbolt hi door insid and jump into hi bed not to be
waken by the most violent knock it seem no bad idea but upon
second thought i dismiss it for who could tell but what the next
morn so soon as i pop out of the room the harpoon might be
stand in the entri all readi to knock me down
still look around me again and see no possibl chanc of
spend a suffer night unless in some other person bed i began
to think that after all i might be cherish unwarrant prejudic
against thi unknown harpoon think i ill wait awhil he must be
drop in befor long ill have a good look at him then and perhap
we mai becom jolli good bedfellow after allther no tell
but though the other boarder kept come in by on two and three
and go to bed yet no sign of my harpoon
landlord said i what sort of a chap is hedo he alwai keep such
late hour it wa now hard upon twelv oclock
the landlord chuckl again with hi lean chuckl and seem to be
mightili tickl at someth beyond my comprehens no he
answer gener he an earli birdairlei to bed and airlei to
risey he the bird what catch the wormbut tonight he went out
a peddl you see and i dont see what on airth keep him so late
unless mai be he cant sell hi head
cant sell hi headwhat sort of a bamboozingli stori is thi you ar
tell me get into a tower rage do you pretend to sai
landlord that thi harpoon is actual engag thi bless
saturdai night or rather sundai morn in peddl hi head around
thi town
that precis it said the landlord and i told him he couldnt
sell it here the market overstock
with what shout i
with head to be sure aint there too mani head in the world
i tell you what it is landlord said i quit calmli youd better
stop spin that yarn to meim not green
mai be not take out a stick and whittl a toothpick but i
rayther guess youll be done brown if that er harpoon hear you a
slanderin hi head
ill break it for him said i now fly into a passion again at
thi unaccount farrago of the landlord
it broke areadi said he
broke said ibrok do you mean
sartain and that the veri reason he cant sell it i guess
landlord said i go up to him as cool as mt hecla in a snow
stormlandlord stop whittl you and i must understand on
anoth and that too without delai i come to your hous and want a
bed you tell me you can onli give me half a on that the other half
belong to a certain harpoon and about thi harpoon whom i have
not yet seen you persist in tell me the most mystifi and
exasper stori tend to beget in me an uncomfort feel
toward the man whom you design for my bedfellowa sort of connexion
landlord which is an intim and confidenti on in the highest
degre i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what thi
harpoon is and whether i shall be in all respect safe to spend the
night with him and in the first place you will be so good as to unsai
that stori about sell hi head which if true i take to be good
evid that thi harpoon is stark mad and iv no idea of
sleep with a madman and you sir you i mean landlord you
sir by try to induc me to do so knowingli would therebi render
yourself liabl to a crimin prosecut
wall said the landlord fetch a long breath that a purti long
sarmon for a chap that rip a littl now and then but be easi be
easi thi here harpoon i have been tellin you of ha just arriv
from the south sea where he bought up a lot of balm new zealand
head great curio you know and he sold all on em but on and
that on he try to sell tonight caus tomorrow sundai and it
would not do to be sellin human head about the street when folk is
goin to church he want to last sundai but i stop him just as
he wa goin out of the door with four head strung on a string for
all the airth like a string of inion
thi account clear up the otherwis unaccount mysteri and show
that the landlord after all had had no idea of fool mebut at the
same time what could i think of a harpoon who stai out a saturdai
night clean into the holi sabbath engag in such a cannib busi
as sell the head of dead idol
depend upon it landlord that harpoon is a danger man
he pai reglar wa the rejoind but come it get dread
late you had better be turn flukesit a nice bed sal and me
slept in that er bed the night we were splice there plenti room
for two to kick about in that bed it an almighti big bed that why
afor we give it up sal us to put our sam and littl johnni in the
foot of it but i got a dream and sprawl about on night and
somehow sam got pitch on the floor and came near break hi arm
after that sal said it wouldnt do come along here ill give ye a
glim in a jiffi and so sai he light a candl and held it toward
me offer to lead the wai but i stood irresolut when look at a
clock in the corner he exclaim i vum it sundayy wont see that
harpoon tonight he come to anchor somewherecom along then
do come wont ye come
i consid the matter a moment and then up stair we went and i wa
usher into a small room cold as a clam and furnish sure enough
with a prodigi bed almost big enough inde for ani four
harpoon to sleep abreast
there said the landlord place the candl on a crazi old sea chest
that did doubl duti as a washstand and centr tabl there make
yourself comfort now and good night to ye i turn round from
ey the bed but he had disappear
fold back the counterpan i stoop over the bed though none of
the most eleg it yet stood the scrutini toler well i then
glanc round the room and besid the bedstead and centr tabl
could see no other furnitur belong to the place but a rude shelf
the four wall and a paper fireboard repres a man strike a
whale of thing not properli belong to the room there wa a
hammock lash up and thrown upon the floor in on corner also a
larg seaman bag contain the harpoon wardrob no doubt in
lieu of a land trunk likewis there wa a parcel of outlandish bone
fish hook on the shelf over the fireplac and a tall harpoon
stand at the head of the bed
but what is thi on the chest i took it up and held it close to the
light and felt it and smelt it and tri everi wai possibl to
arriv at some satisfactori conclus concern it i can compar it
to noth but a larg door mat ornament at the edg with littl
tinkl tag someth like the stain porcupin quill round an
indian moccasin there wa a hole or slit in the middl of thi mat as
you see the same in south american poncho but could it be possibl
that ani sober harpoon would get into a door mat and parad the
street of ani christian town in that sort of guis i put it on to
try it and it weigh me down like a hamper be uncommonli shaggi
and thick and i thought a littl damp as though thi mysteri
harpoon had been wear it of a raini dai i went up in it to a bit
of glass stuck against the wall and i never saw such a sight in my
life i tore myself out of it in such a hurri that i gave myself a kink
in the neck
i sat down on the side of the bed and commenc think about thi
headpeddl harpoon and hi door mat after think some time on
the bedsid i got up and took off my monkei jacket and then stood in
the middl of the room think i then took off my coat and thought a
littl more in my shirt sleev but begin to feel veri cold now
half undress as i wa and rememb what the landlord said about
the harpoon not come home at all that night it be so veri
late i made no more ado but jump out of my pantaloon and boot
and then blow out the light tumbl into bed and commend myself
to the care of heaven
whether that mattress wa stuf with corncob or broken crockeri
there is no tell but i roll about a good deal and could not
sleep for a long time at last i slid off into a light doze and had
pretti nearli made a good of toward the land of nod when i heard
a heavi footfal in the passag and saw a glimmer of light come into
the room from under the door
lord save me think i that must be the harpoon the infern

of a dark purplish yellow color here and there stuck over with larg
blackish look squar ye it just as i thought he a terribl
bedfellow he been in a fight got dreadfulli cut and here he is
just from the surgeon but at that moment he chanc to turn hi face
so toward the light that i plainli saw thei could not be
stickingplast at all those black squar on hi cheek thei were
stain of some sort or other at first i knew not what to make of thi
but soon an inkl of the truth occur to me i rememb a stori
of a white mana whaleman toowho fall among the cannib had
been tattoo by them i conclud that thi harpoon in the cours
of hi distant voyag must have met with a similar adventur and
what is it thought i after all it onli hi outsid a man can be
honest in ani sort of skin but then what to make of hi unearthli
complexion that part of it i mean ly round about and complet
independ of the squar of tattoo to be sure it might be
noth but a good coat of tropic tan but i never heard of a hot
sun tan a white man into a purplish yellow on howev i had
never been in the south sea and perhap the sun there produc these
extraordinari effect upon the skin now while all these idea were
pass through me like lightn thi harpoon never notic me at
all but after some difficulti have open hi bag he commenc
fumbl in it and present pull out a sort of tomahawk and a
sealskin wallet with the hair on place these on the old chest in
the middl of the room he then took the new zealand heada ghastli
thing enoughand cram it down into the bag he now took off hi
hata new beaver hatwhen i came nigh sing out with fresh surpris
there wa no hair on hi headnon to speak of at leastnoth but a
small scalpknot twist up on hi forehead hi bald purplish head now
look for all the world like a mildew skull had not the stranger
stood between me and the door i would have bolt out of it quicker
than ever i bolt a dinner
even as it wa i thought someth of slip out of the window but
it wa the second floor back i am no coward but what to make of thi
headpeddl purpl rascal altogeth pass my comprehens
ignor is the parent of fear and be complet nonpluss and
confound about the stranger i confess i wa now as much afraid of
him as if it wa the devil himself who had thu broken into my room at
the dead of night in fact i wa so afraid of him that i wa not game
enough just then to address him and demand a satisfactori answer
concern what seem inexplic in him
meanwhil he continu the busi of undress and at last show
hi chest and arm as i live these cover part of him were
checker with the same squar as hi face hi back too wa all
over the same dark squar he seem to have been in a thirti year
war and just escap from it with a stickingplast shirt still
more hi veri leg were mark as if a parcel of dark green frog
were run up the trunk of young palm it wa now quit plain that
he must be some abomin savag or other ship aboard of a whaleman
in the south sea and so land in thi christian countri i quak to
think of it a peddler of head tooperhap the head of hi own
brother he might take a fanci to mineheaven look at that tomahawk
but there wa no time for shudder for now the savag went about
someth that complet fascin my attent and convinc me
that he must inde be a heathen go to hi heavi grego or wrapal
or dreadnaught which he had previous hung on a chair he fumbl in
the pocket and produc at length a curiou littl deform imag
with a hunch on it back and exactli the color of a three dai old
congo babi rememb the embalm head at first i almost thought
that thi black manikin wa a real babi preserv in some similar
manner but see that it wa not at all limber and that it glisten
a good deal like polish eboni i conclud that it must be noth
but a wooden idol which inde it prove to be for now the savag
goe up to the empti fireplac and remov the paper fireboard
set up thi littl hunchback imag like a tenpin between the
andiron the chimnei jamb and all the brick insid were veri sooti
so that i thought thi fireplac made a veri appropri littl shrine
or chapel for hi congo idol
i now screw my ey hard toward the half hidden imag feel but
ill at eas meantimeto see what wa next to follow first he take
about a doubl hand of shave out of hi grego pocket and place
them carefulli befor the idol then lai a bit of ship biscuit on
top and appli the flame from the lamp he kindl the shave into
a sacrifici blaze present after mani hasti snatch into the
fire and still hastier withdraw of hi finger wherebi he seem
to be scorch them badli he at last succeed in draw out the
biscuit then blow off the heat and ash a littl he made a polit
offer of it to the littl negro but the littl devil did not seem to
fanci such dry sort of fare at all he never move hi lip all these
strang antic were accompani by still stranger guttur nois from
the devote who seem to be prai in a singsong or els sing
some pagan psalmodi or other dure which hi face twitch about in
the most unnatur manner at last extinguish the fire he took the
idol up veri unceremoni and bag it again in hi grego pocket
as carelessli as if he were a sportsman bag a dead woodcock
all these queer proceed increas my uncomfort and see
him now exhibit strong symptom of conclud hi busi
oper and jump into bed with me i thought it wa high time
now or never befor the light wa put out to break the spell into
which i had so long been bound
but the interv i spent in deliber what to sai wa a fatal on
take up hi tomahawk from the tabl he examin the head of it for
an instant and then hold it to the light with hi mouth at the
handl he puf out great cloud of tobacco smoke the next moment
the light wa extinguish and thi wild cannib tomahawk between
hi teeth sprang into bed with me i sang out i could not help it
now and give a sudden grunt of astonish he began feel me
stammer out someth i knew not what i roll awai from him
against the wall and then conjur him whoever or whatev he might
be to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again but hi

chapter iv the counterpan
upon wake next morn about daylight i found queequeg arm thrown
over me in the most love and affection manner you had almost
thought i had been hi wife the counterpan wa of patchwork full of
odd littl particolor squar and triangl and thi arm of hi
tattoo all over with an intermin cretan labyrinth of a figur no
two part of which were of on precis shadeow i suppos to hi
keep hi arm at sea unmethod in sun and shade hi shirt
sleev irregularli roll up at variou timesthi same arm of hi i
sai look for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork
quilt inde partli ly on it as the arm did when i first awok i
could hardli tell it from the quilt thei so blend their hue
togeth and it wa onli by the sens of weight and pressur that i
could tell that queequeg wa hug me
my sensat were strang let me try to explain them when i wa a
child i well rememb a somewhat similar circumst that befel me
whether it wa a realiti or a dream i never could entir settl the
circumst wa thi i had been cut up some caper or otheri
think it wa try to crawl up the chimnei as i had seen a littl
sweep do a few dai previou and my stepmoth who somehow or other
wa all the time whip me or send me to bed supperlessmi
mother drag me by the leg out of the chimnei and pack me off to
bed though it wa onli two oclock in the afternoon of the 21st june
the longest dai in the year in our hemispher i felt dreadfulli but
there wa no help for it so up stair i went to my littl room in the
third floor undress myself as slowli as possibl so as to kill time
and with a bitter sigh got between the sheet
i lai there dismal calcul that sixteen entir hour must elaps
befor i could hope for a resurrect sixteen hour in bed the small
of my back ach to think of it and it wa so light too the sun
shine in at the window and a great rattl of coach in the
street and the sound of gai voic all over the hous i felt wors
and worseat last i got up dress and softli go down in my
stocking feet sought out my stepmoth and suddenli threw myself at
her feet beseech her as a particular favor to give me a good
slipper for my misbehavior anyth inde but condemn me to lie
ab such an unendur length of time but she wa the best and most
conscienti of stepmoth and back i had to go to my room for
sever hour i lai there broad awak feel a great deal wors than
i have ever done sinc even from the greatest subsequ misfortun
at last i must have fallen into a troubl nightmar of a doze and
slowli wake from ithalf steep in dreamsi open my ey and the
befor sunlit room wa now wrap in outer dark instantli i felt
a shock run through all my frame noth wa to be seen and
noth wa to be heard but a supernatur hand seem place in mine
my arm hung over the counterpan and the nameless unimagin
silent form or phantom to which the hand belong seem close
seat by my bedsid for what seem ag pile on ag i lai there
frozen with the most aw fear not dare to drag awai my hand yet
ever think that if i could but stir it on singl inch the horrid
spell would be broken i knew not how thi conscious at last glide
awai from me but wake in the morn i shudderingli rememb it
all and for dai and week and month afterward i lost myself in
confound attempt to explain the mysteri nai to thi veri hour i
often puzzl myself with it
now take awai the aw fear and my sensat at feel the
supernatur hand in mine were veri similar in their strang to
those which i experienc on wake up and see queequeg pagan arm
thrown round me but at length all the past night event soberli
recur on by on in fix realiti and then i lai onli aliv to
the comic predica for though i tri to move hi armunlock hi
bridegroom claspyet sleep as he wa he still hug me tightli
as though naught but death should part us twain i now strove to rous
himqueequegbut hi onli answer wa a snore i then roll over my
neck feel as if it were in a horsecollar and suddenli felt a
slight scratch throw asid the counterpan there lai the tomahawk
sleep by the savag side as if it were a hatchetfac babi a
pretti pickl truli thought i ab here in a strang hous in the
broad dai with a cannib and a tomahawk queequegin the name of
good queequeg wake at length by dint of much wriggl and
loud and incess expostul upon the unbecoming of hi
hug a fellow male in that matrimoni sort of style i succeed in
extract a grunt and present he drew back hi arm shook himself
all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and sat up in
bed stiff as a pikestaff look at me and rub hi ey as if
he did not altogeth rememb how i came to be there though a dim
conscious of know someth about me seem slowli dawn over
him meanwhil i lai quietli ey him have no seriou misgiv
now and bent upon narrowli observ so curiou a creatur when at
last hi mind seem made up touch the charact of hi bedfellow
and he becam as it were reconcil to the fact he jump out upon
the floor and by certain sign and sound gave me to understand that
if it pleas me he would dress first and then leav me to dress
afterward leav the whole apart to myself think i queequeg
under the circumst thi is a veri civil overtur but the
truth is these savag have an innat sens of delicaci sai what you
will it is marvel how essenti polit thei ar i pai thi
particular compliment to queequeg becaus he treat me with so much
civil and consider while i wa guilti of great rude
stare at him from the bed and watch all hi toilett motion for
the time my curios get the better of my breed nevertheless
a man like queequeg you dont see everi dai he and hi wai were well
worth unusu regard
he commenc dress at top by don hi beaver hat a veri tall
on by the by and thenstil minu hi trowsersh hunt up hi
boot what under the heaven he did it for i cannot tell but hi
next movement wa to crush himselfboot in hand and hat onund the
bed when from sundri violent gasp and strain i infer he
wa hard at work boot himself though by no law of proprieti that i
ever heard of is ani man requir to be privat when put on hi
boot but queequeg do you see wa a creatur in the transit
stateneith caterpillar nor butterfli he wa just enough civil
to show off hi outlandish in the strangest possibl manner hi
educ wa not yet complet he wa an undergradu if he had not
been a small degre civil he veri probabl would not have troubl
himself with boot at all but then if he had not been still a savag
he never would have dreamt of get under the bed to put them on at
last he emerg with hi hat veri much dent and crush down over
hi ey and began creak and limp about the room as if not
be much accustom to boot hi pair of damp wrinkl cowhid
onesprob not made to order eitherrath pinch and torment him
at the first go off of a bitter cold morn
see now that there were no curtain to the window and that the
street be veri narrow the hous opposit command a plain view
into the room and observ more and more the indecor figur that
queequeg made stave about with littl els but hi hat and boot on
i beg him as well as i could to acceler hi toilet somewhat and
particularli to get into hi pantaloon as soon as possibl he
compli and then proceed to wash himself at that time in the
morn ani christian would have wash hi face but queequeg to my
amaz content himself with restrict hi ablut to hi
chest arm and hand he then don hi waistcoat and take up a
piec of hard soap on the washstand centret dip it into water
and commenc lather hi face i wa watch to see where he kept
hi razor when lo and behold he take the harpoon from the bed
corner slip out the long wooden stock unsheath the head whet it
a littl on hi boot and stride up to the bit of mirror against the
wall begin a vigor scrape or rather harpoon of hi cheek
think i queequeg thi is us rogerss best cutleri with a
vengeanc afterward i wonder the less at thi oper when i came
to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and how
exceedingli sharp the long straight edg ar alwai kept
the rest of hi toilet wa soon achiev and he proudli march out of
the room wrap up in hi great pilot monkei jacket and sport hi
harpoon like a marshal baton
chapter v breakfast

grin landlord veri pleasantli i cherish no malic toward him
though he had been skylark with me not a littl in the matter of my
bedfellow
howev a good laugh is a mighti good thing and rather too scarc a
good thing the more the piti so if ani on man in hi own proper
person afford stuff for a good joke to anybodi let him not be
backward but let him cheerfulli allow himself to spend and be spent in
that wai and the man that ha anyth bountifulli laughabl about
him be sure there is more in that man than you perhap think for
the barroom wa now full of the boarder who had been drop in the
night previou and whom i had not as yet had a good look at thei were
nearli all whalemen chief mate and second mate and third mate
and sea carpent and sea cooper and sea blacksmith and

young fellow healthi cheek is like a suntoast pear in hue and
would seem to smell almost as muski he cannot have been three dai
land from hi indian voyag that man next him look a few shade
lighter you might sai a touch of satin wood is in him in the
complexion of a third still linger a tropic tawn but slightli
bleach withal he doubtless ha tarri whole week ashor but who

went to breakfast
thei sai that men who have seen the world therebi becom quit at eas
in manner quit selfpossess in compani not alwai though
ledyard the great new england travel and mungo park the scotch
on of all men thei possess the least assur in the parlor but
perhap the mere cross of siberia in a sledg drawn by dog as
ledyard did or the take a long solitari walk on an empti stomach in
the negro heart of africa which wa the sum of poor mungo
performancesthi kind of travel i sai mai not be the veri best mode
of attain a high social polish still for the most part that sort
of thing is to be had anywher

cloth jacket seem almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of
the water it had absorb howev hat and coat and oversho were on
by on remov and hung up in a littl space in an adjac corner
when arrai in a decent suit he quietli approach the pulpit
like most old fashion pulpit it wa a veri lofti on and sinc a
regular stair to such a height would by it long angl with the
floor serious contract the alreadi small area of the chapel the
architect it seem had act upon the hint of father mappl and
finish the pulpit without a stair substitut a perpendicular side
ladder like those us in mount a ship from a boat at sea the wife
of a whale captain had provid the chapel with a handsom pair of
red worst manrop for thi ladder which be itself nice
head and stain with a mahogani color the whole contriv
consid what manner of chapel it wa seem by no mean in bad
tast halt for an instant at the foot of the ladder and with both
hand grasp the ornament knob of the manrop father mappl
cast a look upward and then with a truli sailorlik but still
reverenti dexter hand over hand mount the step as if
ascend the maintop of hi vessel
the perpendicular part of thi side ladder as is usual the case
with swing on were of clothcov rope onli the round were of
wood so that at everi step there wa a joint at my first glimps of
the pulpit it had not escap me that howev conveni for a ship
these joint in the present instanc seem unnecessari for i wa not
prepar to see father mappl after gain the height slowli turn
round and stoop over the pulpit deliber drag up the ladder
step by step till the whole wa deposit within leav him
impregn in hi littl quebec
i ponder some time without fulli comprehend the reason for thi
father mappl enjoi such a wide reput for sincer and
sanctiti that i could not suspect him of court notorieti by ani
mere trick of the stage no thought i there must be some sober
reason for thi thing furthermor it must symbol someth unseen
can it be then that by that act of physic isol he signifi
hi spiritu withdraw for the time from all outward worldli ti
and connexion ye for replenish with the meat and wine of the
word to the faith man of god thi pulpit i see is a
selfcontain strongholda lofti ehrenbreitstein with a perenni
well of water within the wall
but the side ladder wa not the onli strang featur of the place
borrow from the chaplain former seafar between the marbl
cenotaph on either hand of the pulpit the wall which form it back
wa adorn with a larg paint repres a gallant ship beat
against a terribl storm off a lee coast of black rock and snowi
breaker but high abov the fly scud and darkrol cloud there
float a littl isl of sunlight from which beam forth an angel
face and thi bright face shed a distinct spot of radianc upon the
ship toss deck someth like that silver plate now insert into
the victori plank where nelson fell ah nobl ship the angel
seem to sai beat on beat on thou nobl ship and bear a hardi
helm for lo the sun is break through the cloud ar roll
offserenest azur is at hand
nor wa the pulpit itself without a trace of the same seatast that
had achiev the ladder and the pictur it panel front wa in the
like of a ship bluff bow and the holi bibl rest on the
project piec of scroll work fashion after a ship fiddlehead
beak
what could be more full of meaningfor the pulpit is ever thi earth
foremost part all the rest come in it rear the pulpit lead the
world from thenc it is the storm of god quick wrath is first
descri and the bow must bear the earliest brunt from thenc it is
the god of breez fair or foul is first invok for favor wind
ye the world a ship on it passag out and not a voyag complet
and the pulpit is it prow
chapter ix the sermon
father mappl rose and in a mild voic of unassum author order
the scatter peopl to condens starboard gangwai there side awai
to larboardlarboard gangwai to starboard midship midship
there wa a low rumbl of heavi seaboot among the bench and a
still slighter shuffl of women shoe and all wa quiet again and
everi ey on the preacher
he paus a littl then kneel in the pulpit bow fold hi
larg brown hand across hi chest uplift hi close ey and
offer a prayer so deepli devout that he seem kneel and prai
at the bottom of the sea
thi end in prolong solemn tone like the continu toll of a
bell in a ship that is founder at sea in a fogin such tone he
commenc read the follow hymn but chang hi manner toward
the conclud stanza burst forth with a peal exult and joi
the rib and terror in the whale
arch over me a dismal gloom
while all god sunlit wave roll by
and lift me deepen down to doom
i saw the open maw of hell
with endless pain and sorrow there
which none but thei that feel can tell
oh i wa plung to despair
in black distress i call my god
when i could scarc believ him mine
he bow hi ear to my complaint
no more the whale did me confin
with speed he flew to my relief
as on a radiant dolphin born
aw yet bright as lightn shone
the face of my deliver god
my song for ever shall record
that terribl that joy hour
i give the glori to my god
hi all the merci and the power
nearli all join in sing thi hymn which swell high abov the
howl of the storm a brief paus ensu the preacher slowli turn
over the leav of the bibl and at last fold hi hand down upon
the proper page said belov shipmat clinch the last vers of the
first chapter of jonahand god had prepar a great fish to swallow up
jonah
shipmat thi book contain onli four chaptersfour yarnsi on
of the smallest strand in the mighti cabl of the scriptur yet what
depth of the soul doe jonah deep sealin sound what a pregnant
lesson to us is thi prophet what a nobl thing is that canticl in
the fish belli how billowlik and boister grand we feel the
flood surg over us we sound with him to the kelpi bottom of the
water seawe and all the slime of the sea is about us but what
is thi lesson that the book of jonah teach shipmat it is a
twostrand lesson a lesson to us all as sin men and a lesson to
me as a pilot of the live god as sin men it is a lesson to us
all becaus it is a stori of the sin hardhearted suddenli
awaken fear the swift punish repent prayer and final
the deliver and joi of jonah as with all sinner among men the
sin of thi son of amittai wa in hi wil disobedi of the
command of godnev mind now what that command wa or how
conveyedwhich he found a hard command but all the thing that god
would have us do ar hard for us to dorememb thatand henc he
often command us than endeavor to persuad and if we obei god we
must disobei ourselv and it is in thi disobei ourselv wherein
the hard of obei god consist
with thi sin of disobedi in him jonah still further flout at
god by seek to flee from him he think that a ship made by men
will carri him into countri where god doe not reign but onli the
captain of thi earth he skulk about the wharv of joppa and seek
a ship that bound for tarshish there lurk perhap a hitherto
unheed mean here by all account tarshish could have been no
other citi than the modern cadiz that the opinion of learn men
and where is cadiz shipmat cadiz is in spain as far by water from
joppa as jonah could possibl have sail in those ancient dai when
the atlant wa an almost unknown sea becaus joppa the modern
jaffa shipmat is on the most easterli coast of the mediterranean
the syrian and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand mile to the
westward from that just outsid the strait of gibraltar see ye not
then shipmat that jonah sought to flee worldwid from god
miser man oh most contempt and worthi of all scorn with
slouch hat and guilti ey skulk from hi god prowl among the
ship like a vile burglar hasten to cross the sea so
disord selfcondemn is hi look that had there been policemen
in those dai jonah on the mere suspicion of someth wrong had
been arrest er he touch a deck how plainli he a fugit no
baggag not a hatbox valis or carpetbagno friend accompani him
to the wharf with their adieux at last after much dodg search he
find the tarshish ship receiv the last item of her cargo and as
he step on board to see it captain in the cabin all the sailor for
the moment desist from hoist in the good to mark the stranger
evil ey jonah see thi but in vain he tri to look all eas and
confid in vain essai hi wretch smile strong intuit of the
man assur the marin he can be no innoc in their gamesom but
still seriou wai on whisper to the otherjack he rob a
widow or joe do you mark him he a bigamist or harri lad i
guess he the adulter that broke jail in old gomorrah or belik
on of the miss murder from sodom anoth run to read the bill
that stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is
moor offer five hundr gold coin for the apprehens of a
parricid and contain a descript of hi person he read and
look from jonah to the bill while all hi sympathet shipmat now
crowd round jonah prepar to lai their hand upon him fright jonah
trembl and summon all hi bold to hi face onli look so
much the more a coward he will not confess himself suspect but that
itself is strong suspicion so he make the best of it and when the
sailor find him not to be the man that is advertis thei let him
pass and he descend into the cabin
who there cri the captain at hi busi desk hurriedli make out
hi paper for the customswho there oh how that harmless
question mangl jonah for the instant he almost turn to flee again
but he ralli i seek a passag in thi ship to tarshish how soon
sail ye sir thu far the busi captain had not look up to jonah
though the man now stand befor him but no sooner doe he hear that
hollow voic than he dart a scrutin glanc we sail with the
next come tide at last he slowli answer still intent ey
him no sooner sirsoon enough for ani honest man that goe a
passeng ha jonah that anoth stab but he swiftli call awai
the captain from that scent ill sail with yehe saysth passag
monei how much is thatil pai now for it is particularli written
shipmat as if it were a thing not to be overlook in thi histori
that he paid the fare thereof er the craft did sail and taken with
the context thi is full of mean
now jonah captain shipmat wa on whose discern detect crime
in ani but whose cupid expos it onli in the penniless in thi
world shipmat sin that pai it wai can travel freeli and without
a passport wherea virtu if a pauper is stop at all frontier
so jonah captain prepar to test the length of jonah purs er he
judg him openli he charg him thrice the usual sum and it
assent to then the captain know that jonah is a fugit but at
the same time resolv to help a flight that pave it rear with gold
yet when jonah fairli take out hi purs prudent suspicion still
molest the captain he ring everi coin to find a counterfeit not a
forger ani wai he mutter and jonah is put down for hi passag
point out my stateroom sir sai jonah now im travelweari i
need sleep thou lookst like it sai the captain there thy
room jonah enter and would lock the door but the lock contain no
kei hear him foolishli fumbl there the captain laugh lowli to
himself and mutter someth about the door of convict cell be
never allow to be lock within all dress and dusti as he is
jonah throw himself into hi berth and find the littl stateroom
ceil almost rest on hi forehead the air is close and jonah
gasp then in that contract hole sunk too beneath the ship
waterlin jonah feel the herald presenti of that stifl
hour when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of hi bowel
ward
screw at it axi against the side a swing lamp slightli
oscil in jonah room and the ship heel over toward the
wharf with the weight of the last bale receiv the lamp flame and
all though in slight motion still maintain a perman obliqu
with refer to the room though in truth infal straight
itself it but made obviou the fals ly level among which it
hung the lamp alarm and frighten jonah as ly in hi berth hi
torment ey roll round the place and thi thu far success
fugit find no refug for hi restless glanc but that
contradict in the lamp more and more appal him the floor the
ceil and the side ar all awri oh so my conscienc hang in
me he groan straight upward so it burn but the chamber of my
soul ar all in crooked
like on who after a night of drunken revelri hi to hi bed still
reel but with conscienc yet prick him as the plung of the
roman racehors but so much the more strike hi steel tag into him
as on who in that miser plight still turn and turn in giddi
anguish prai god for annihil until the fit be pass and at
last amid the whirl of woe he feel a deep stupor steal over him as
over the man who bleed to death for conscienc is the wound and
there naught to staunch it so after sore wrestl in hi berth
jonah prodigi of ponder miseri drag him drown down to sleep
and now the time of tide ha come the ship cast off her cabl and
from the desert wharf the uncheer ship for tarshish all careen
glide to sea that ship my friend wa the first of record
smuggler the contraband wa jonah but the sea rebel he will not
bear the wick burden a dread storm come on the ship is like to
break but now when the boatswain call all hand to lighten her when
box bale and jar ar clatter overboard when the wind is
shriek and the men ar yell and everi plank thunder with
trampl feet right over jonah head in all thi rage tumult
jonah sleep hi hideou sleep he see no black sky and rage sea
feel not the reel timber and littl hear he or heed he the far
rush of the mighti whale which even now with open mouth is cleav
the sea after him ay shipmat jonah wa gone down into the side
of the shipa berth in the cabin as i have taken it and wa fast
asleep but the frighten master come to him and shriek in hi dead
ear what meanest thou o sleeper aris startl from hi lethargi
by that dire cry jonah stagger to hi feet and stumbl to the
deck grasp a shroud to look out upon the sea but at that moment he
is sprung upon by a panther billow leap over the bulwark wave
after wave thu leap into the ship and find no speedi vent run
roar fore and aft till the marin come nigh to drown while yet
afloat and ever as the white moon show her affright face from the
steep gulli in the black overhead aghast jonah see the rear
bowsprit point high upward but soon beat downward again toward the
torment deep
terror upon terror run shout through hi soul in all hi
cring attitud the godfugit is now too plainli known the
sailor mark him more and more certain grow their suspicion of him
and at last fulli to test the truth by refer the whole matter to
high heaven thei fall to cast lot to see for whose caus thi
great tempest wa upon them the lot is jonah that discov then
how furious thei mob him with their question what is thine
occup whenc comest thou thy countri what peopl but mark
now my shipmat the behavior of poor jonah the eager marin but
ask him who he is and where from wherea thei not onli receiv an
answer to those question but likewis anoth answer to a question
not put by them but the unsolicit answer is forc from jonah by the
hard hand of god that is upon him
i am a hebrew he criesand theni fear the lord the god of heaven
who hath made the sea and the dry land fear him o jonah ay well
mightest thou fear the lord god then straightwai he now goe on to
make a full confess whereupon the marin becam more and more
appal but still ar piti for when jonah not yet supplic
god for merci sinc he but too well knew the dark of hi
desertswhen wretch jonah cri out to them to take him and cast him
forth into the sea for he knew that for hi sake thi great tempest
wa upon them thei mercifulli turn from him and seek by other mean
to save the ship but all in vain the indign gale howl louder
then with on hand rais invokingli to god with the other thei not
unreluctantli lai hold of jonah
and now behold jonah taken up as an anchor and drop into the sea
when instantli an oili calm float out from the east and the sea
is still as jonah carri down the gale with him leav smooth water
behind he goe down in the whirl heart of such a masterless
commot that he scarc heed the moment when he drop seeth into
the yawn jaw await him and the whale shootsto all hi ivori
teeth like the lord out of the fish belli but observ hi prayer
and so mani white bolt upon hi prison then jonah prai unto learn
a weighti lesson for sin as he is jonah doe not weep and wail for
direct deliver he feel that hi dread punish is just he
leav all hi deliver to god content himself with thi that
spite of all hi pain and pang he will still look toward hi holi
templ and here shipmat is true and faith repent not
clamor for pardon but grate for punish and how pleas to
god wa thi conduct in jonah is shown in the eventu deliver of
him from the sea and the whale shipmat i do not place jonah befor
you to be copi for hi sin but i do place him befor you as a model
for repent sin not but if you do take heed to repent of it like
jonah
while he wa speak these word the howl of the shriek
slant storm without seem to add new power to the preacher who
when describ jonah seastorm seem toss by a storm himself
hi deep chest heav as with a groundswel hi toss arm seem
the war element at work and the thunder that roll awai from
off hi swarthi brow and the light leap from hi ey made all hi
simpl hearer look on him with a quick fear that wa strang to them
there now came a lull in hi look as he silent turn over the
leav of the book onc more and at last stand motionless with
close ey for the moment seem commun with god and himself
but again he lean over toward the peopl and bow hi head lowli
with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humil he spake these
word
shipmat god ha laid but on hand upon you both hi hand press
upon me i have read ye by what murki light mai be mine the lesson that
jonah teach to all sinner and therefor to ye and still more to
me for i am a greater sinner than ye and now how gladli would i come
down from thi masthead and sit on the hatch there where you sit
and listen as you listen while some on of you read me that other
and more aw lesson which jonah teach to me as a pilot of the
live god how be an anoint pilotprophet or speaker of true
thing and bidden by the lord to sound those unwelcom truth in the
ear of a wick nineveh jonah appal at the hostil he should
rais fled from hi mission and sought to escap hi duti and hi god
by take ship at joppa but god is everywher tarshish he never
reach as we have seen god came upon him in the whale and swallow
him down to live gulf of doom and with swift slant tore him
along into the midst of the sea where the eddi depth suck him
ten thousand fathom down and the weed were wrap about hi head
and all the wateri world of woe bowl over him yet even then beyond
the reach of ani plummetout of the belli of hellwhen the whale
ground upon the ocean utmost bone even then god heard the
engulph repent prophet when he cri then god spake unto the
fish and from the shudder cold and black of the sea the whale
came breech up toward the warm and pleasant sun and all the
delight of air and earth and vomit out jonah upon the dry land
when the word of the lord came a second time and jonah bruis and
beatenhi ear like two seashel still multitudin murmur

shipmat to preach the truth to the face of falsehood that wa it

not be true even though to be fals were salvat yea woe to him

and he wa left alon in the place
chapter x a bosom friend
return to the spouterinn from the chapel i found queequeg there
quit alon he have left the chapel befor the benedict some
time he wa sit on a bench befor the fire with hi feet on the

but be now interrupt he put up the imag and pretti soon go
to the tabl took up a larg book there and place it on hi lap
began count the page with deliber regular at everi fiftieth
pagea i fanciedstop a moment look vacantli around him and
give utter to a longdrawn gurgl whistl of astonish he
would then begin again at the next fifti seem to commenc at number
on each time as though he could not count more than fifti and it wa
onli by such a larg number of fifti be found togeth that hi
astonish at the multitud of page wa excit
with much interest i sat watch him savag though he wa and
hideous mar about the faceat least to my tastehi counten
yet had a someth in it which wa by no mean disagre you
cannot hide the soul through all hi unearthli tattoo i thought i
saw the trace of a simpl honest heart and in hi larg deep ey
fieri black and bold there seem token of a spirit that would dare a
thousand devil and besid all thi there wa a certain lofti
bear about the pagan which even hi uncouth could not
altogeth maim he look like a man who had never cring and never
had had a creditor whether it wa too that hi head be shave
hi forehead wa drawn out in freer and brighter relief and look
more expans than it otherwis would thi i will not ventur to
decid but certain it wa hi head wa phrenolog an excel
on it mai seem ridicul but it remind me of gener washington
head as seen in the popular bust of him it had the same long
regularli grade retreat slope from abov the brow which were
likewis veri project like two long promontori thickli wood on

whilst i wa thu close scan him halfpretend meanwhil to be
look out at the storm from the casement he never heed my
presenc never troubl himself with so much as a singl glanc but
appear wholli occupi with count the page of the marvel
book consid how sociabl we had been sleep togeth the night
previou and especi consid the affection arm i had found
thrown over me upon wake in the morn i thought thi indiffer
of hi veri strang but savag ar strang be at time you do
not know exactli how to take them at first thei ar overaw their
calm selfcollected of simplic seem a socrat wisdom i had
notic also that queequeg never consort at all or but veri littl
with the other seamen in the inn he made no advanc whatev
appear to have no desir to enlarg the circl of hi acquaint
all thi struck me as mighti singular yet upon second thought there
wa someth almost sublim in it here wa a man some twenti thousand
mile from home by the wai of cape horn that iswhich wa the onli
wai he could get therethrown among peopl as strang to him as though
he were in the planet jupit and yet he seem entir at hi eas
preserv the utmost seren content with hi own companionship
alwai equal to himself sure thi wa a touch of fine philosophi
though no doubt he had never heard there wa such a thing as that but
perhap to be true philosoph we mortal should not be consciou of
so live or so strive so soon as i hear that such or such a man
give himself out for a philosoph i conclud that like the
dyspept old woman he must have broken hi digest
as i sat there in that now lone room the fire burn low in that
mild stage when after it first intens ha warm the air it then
onli glow to be look at the even shade and phantom gather
round the casement and peer in upon us silent solitari twain the
storm boom without in solemn swell i began to be sensibl of
strang feel i felt a melt in me no more my splinter heart
and madden hand were turn against the wolfish world thi sooth
savag had redeem it there he sat hi veri indiffer speak a
natur in which there lurk no civil hypocrisi and bland
deceit wild he wa a veri sight of sight to see yet i began to
feel myself mysteri drawn toward him and those same thing that
would have repel most other thei were the veri magnet that thu
drew me ill try a pagan friend thought i sinc christian kind
ha prove but hollow courtesi i drew my bench near him and made some
friendli sign and hint do my best to talk with him meanwhil at
first he littl notic these advanc but present upon my
refer to hi last night hospit he made out to ask me
whether we were again to be bedfellow i told him ye whereat i
thought he look pleas perhap a littl compliment
we then turn over the book togeth and i endeavor to explain to
him the purpos of the print and the mean of the few pictur
that were in it thu i soon engag hi interest and from that we
went to jabber the best we could about the variou outer sight to
be seen in thi famou town soon i propos a social smoke and
produc hi pouch and tomahawk he quietli offer me a puff and
then we sat exchang puff from that wild pipe of hi and keep it
regularli pass between us
if there yet lurk ani ic of indiffer toward me in the pagan
breast thi pleasant genial smoke we had soon thaw it out and
left us croni he seem to take to me quit as natur and
unbiddenli as i to him and when our smoke wa over he press hi
forehead against mine clasp me round the waist and said that
henceforth we were marri mean in hi countri phrase that we
were bosom friend he would gladli die for me if need should be in a
countryman thi sudden flame of friendship would have seem far too
prematur a thing to be much distrust but in thi simpl savag
those old rule would not appli
after supper and anoth social chat and smoke we went to our room
togeth he made me a present of hi embalm head took out hi
enorm tobacco wallet and grope under the tobacco drew out some
thirti dollar in silver then spread them on the tabl and
mechan divid them into two equal portion push on of them
toward me and said it wa mine i wa go to remonstr but he
silenc me by pour them into my trowser pocket i let them stai
he then went about hi even prayer took out hi idol and remov
the paper fireboard by certain sign and symptom i thought he seem
anxiou for me to join him but well know what wa to follow i
deliber a moment whether in case he invit me i would compli or
otherwis
i wa a good christian born and bred in the bosom of the infal
presbyterian church how then could i unit with thi wild idol in
worship hi piec of wood but what is worship thought i do you
suppos now ishmael that the magnanim god of heaven and
earthpagan and all includedcan possibl be jealou of an
insignific bit of black wood imposs but what is worshipto do
the will of godthat is worship and what is the will of godto do
to my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to methat is
the will of god now queequeg is my fellow man and what do i wish
that thi queequeg would do to me why unit with me in my particular
presbyterian form of worship consequ i must then unit with him
in hi ergo i must turn idol so i kindl the shave help
prop up the innoc littl idol offer him burnt biscuit with
queequeg salam befor him twice or thrice kiss hi nose and that
done we undress and went to bed at peac with our own conscienc
and all the world but we did not go to sleep without some littl chat
how it is i know not but there is no place like a bed for confidenti
disclosur between friend man and wife thei sai there open the
veri bottom of their soul to each other and some old coupl often
lie and chat over old time till nearli morn thu then in our
heart honeymoon lai i and queequega cosi love pair
chapter xi nightgown
we had lain thu in bed chat and nap at short interv and
queequeg now and then affection throw hi brown tattoo leg
over mine and then draw them back so entir sociabl and free
and easi were we when at last by reason of our confabul what
littl nappish remain in us altogeth depart and we felt like
get up again though daybreak wa yet some wai down the futur
ye we becam veri wake so much so that our recumb posit
began to grow wearisom and by littl and littl we found ourselv
sit up the cloth well tuck around us lean against the
headboard with our four knee drawn up close togeth and our two
nose bend over them as if our kneepan were warmingpan we felt
veri nice and snug the more so sinc it wa so chilli out of door
inde out of bedcloth too see that there wa no fire in the
room the more so i sai becaus truli to enjoi bodili warmth some
small part of you must be cold for there is no qualiti in thi world
that is not what it is mere by contrast noth exist in itself if
you flatter yourself that you ar all over comfort and have been
so a long time then you cannot be said to be comfort ani more but
if like queequeg and me in the bed the tip of your nose or the crown
of your head be slightli chill why then inde in the gener
conscious you feel most delightfulli and unmistak warm for
thi reason a sleep apart should never be furnish with a fire
which is on of the luxuri discomfort of the rich for the height
of thi sort of delici is to have noth but the blanket
between you and your snug and the cold of the outer air then there
you lie like the on warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal
we had been sit in thi crouch manner for some time when all at
onc i thought i would open my ey for when between sheet whether
by dai or by night and whether asleep or awak i have a wai of alwai
keep my ey shut in order the more to concentr the snug of
be in bed becaus no man can ever feel hi own ident aright
except hi ey be close as if dark were inde the proper
element of our essenc though light be more congeni to our clayei

chapter xiv nantucket
noth more happen on the passag worthi the mention so after a
fine run we safe arriv in nantucket
nantucket take out your map and look at it see what a real corner of
the world it occupi how it stand there awai off shore more lone
than the eddyston lighthous look at ita mere hillock and elbow of
sand all beach without a background there is more sand there than
you would us in twenti year as a substitut for blot paper some
gamesom wight will tell you that thei have to plant weed there thei
dont grow natur that thei import canada thistl that thei have
to send beyond sea for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask that
piec of wood in nantucket ar carri about like bit of the true
cross in rome that peopl there plant toadstool befor their hous
to get under the shade in summer time that on blade of grass make an

shoe someth like lapland snowsho that thei ar so shut up
belt about everi wai inclos surround and made an utter island
of by the ocean that to their veri chair and tabl small clam will
sometim be found adher as to the back of sea turtl but these
extravaganza onli show that nantucket is no illinoi
look now at the wondrou tradit stori of how thi island wa
settl by the redmen thu goe the legend in olden time an eagl
swoop down upon the new england coast and carri off an infant
indian in hi talon with loud lament the parent saw their child
born out of sight over the wide water thei resolv to follow in the
same direct set out in their cano after a peril passag
thei discov the island and there thei found an empti ivori
casketth poor littl indian skeleton
what wonder then that these nantucket born on a beach should
take to the sea for a livelihood thei first caught crab and quohog
in the sand grown bolder thei wade out with net for mackerel more
experienc thei push off in boat and captur cod and at last
launch a navi of great ship on the sea explor thi wateri world
put an incess belt of circumnavig round it peep in at

chapter xvi the ship
in bed we concoct our plan for the morrow but to my surpris and no
small concern queequeg now gave me to understand that he had been
dilig consult yojoth name of hi black littl godand yojo
had told him two or three time over and strongli insist upon it
everywai that instead of our go togeth among the whalingfleet in
harbor and in concert select our craft instead of thi i sai
yojo earnestli enjoin that the select of the ship should rest
wholli with me inasmuch as yojo purpos befriend us and in order
to do so had alreadi pitch upon a vessel which if left to myself
i ishmael should infal light upon for all the world as though
it had turn out by chanc and in that vessel i must immedi ship
myself for the present irrespect of queequeg
i have forgotten to mention that in mani thing queequeg place great
confid in the excel of yojo judgment and surpris forecast
of thing and cherish yojo with consider esteem as a rather
good sort of god who perhap meant well enough upon the whole but in
all case did not succe in hi benevol design
now thi plan of queequeg or rather yojo touch the select
of our craft i did not like that plan at all i had not a littl
reli on queequeg sagac to point out the whaler best fit to
carri us and our fortun secur but as all my remonstr
produc no effect upon queequeg i wa oblig to acquiesc and
accordingli prepar to set about thi busi with a determin
rush sort of energi and vigor that should quickli settl that
trifl littl affair next morn earli leav queequeg shut up
with yojo in our littl bedroomfor it seem that it wa some sort of
lent or ramadan or dai of fast humili and prayer with
queequeg and yojo that dai how it wa i never could find out for
though i appli myself to it sever time i never could master hi
liturgi and xxxix articlesleav queequeg then fast on hi
tomahawk pipe and yojo warm himself at hi sacrifici fire of
shave i salli out among the ship after much prolong
saunter and mani random inquiri i learnt that there were three
ship up for threeyear voyagesth devildam the titbit and the
pequod devildam i do not know the origin of titbit is obviou
pequod you will no doubt rememb wa the name of a celebr
tribe of massachusett indian now extinct as the ancient mede i
peer and pry about the devildam from her hop over to the
titbit and final go on board the pequod look around her for
a moment and then decid that thi wa the veri ship for us
you mai have seen mani a quaint craft in your dai for aught i
knowsquaredto lugger mountain japanes junk butterbox
galliot and what not but take my word for it you never saw such a
rare old craft as thi same rare old pequod she wa a ship of the old
school rather small if anyth with an old fashion clawfoot
look about her long season and weatherstain in the typhoon and
calm of all four ocean her old hull complexion wa darken like a
french grenadi who ha alik fought in egypt and siberia her
vener bow look beard her mastscut somewher on the coast of
japan where her origin on were lost overboard in a galeh mast
stood stiffli up like the spine of the three old king of cologn her
ancient deck were worn and wrinkl like the pilgrimworship

inlaid it all over with a quaint both of materi and devic
unmatch by anyth except it be thorkillhak carv buckler or
bedstead she wa apparel like ani barbar ethiopian emperor hi
neck heavi with pendant of polish ivori she wa a thing of
trophi a cannib of a craft trick herself forth in the chase
bone of her enemi all round her unpanel open bulwark were
garnish like on continu jaw with the long sharp teeth of the
sperm whale insert there for pin to fasten her old hempen thew
and tendon to those thew ran not through base block of land wood
but deftli travel over sheav of seaivori scorn a turnstil
wheel at her reverend helm she sport there a tiller and that tiller
wa in on mass curious carv from the long narrow lower jaw of her
hereditari foe the helmsman who steer by that tiller in a tempest
felt like the tartar when he hold back hi fieri steed by clutch
it jaw a nobl craft but somehow a most melancholi all nobl thing
ar touch with that
now when i look about the quarterdeck for some on have
author in order to propos myself as a candid for the voyag at
first i saw nobodi but i could not well overlook a strang sort of
tent or rather wigwam pitch a littl behind the mainmast it
seem onli a temporari erect us in port it wa of a conic
shape some ten feet high consist of the long huge slab of limber
black bone taken from the middl and highest part of the jaw of the
rightwhal plant with their broad end on the deck a circl of
these slab lace togeth mutual slope toward each other and at
the apex unit in a tuft point where the loos hairi fibr wave
to and fro like a topknot on some old pottowotami sachem head a
triangular open face toward the bow of the ship so that the
insid command a complet view forward
and half conceal in thi queer tenement i at length found on who by
hi aspect seem to have author and who it be noon and the
ship work suspend wa now enjoi respit from the burden of
command he wa seat on an oldfashion oaken chair wriggl all
over with curiou carv and the bottom of which wa form of a
stout interlac of the same elast stuff of which the wigwam wa
construct
there wa noth so veri particular perhap about the appear of
the elderli man i saw he wa brown and brawni like most old seamen
and heavili roll up in blue pilotcloth cut in the quaker style
onli there wa a fine and almost microscop network of the minutest
wrinkl interlac round hi ey which must have arisen from hi
continu sail in mani hard gale and alwai look to

ship but fluke man what make thee want to go a whale ehit
look a littl suspici dont it ehhast not been a pirat hast
thoudidst not rob thy last captain didst thoudost not think of
murder the offic when thou gettest to sea
i protest my innoc of these thing i saw that under the mask of
these half humor inuendo thi old seaman as an insul
quakerish nantucket wa full of hi insular prejudic and rather
distrust of all alien unless thei hail from cape cod or the
vineyard
but what take thee awhal i want to know that befor i think of
ship ye
well sir i want to see what whale is i want to see the world
want to see what whale is eh have ye clap ey on captain ahab
who is captain ahab sir
ay ay i thought so captain ahab is the captain of thi ship
i am mistaken then i thought i wa speak to the captain himself
thou art speak to captain pelegthat who ye ar speak to
young man it belong to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fit
out for the voyag and suppli with all her need includ crew we
ar part owner and agent but as i wa go to sai if thou wantest
to know what whale is as thou tellest ye do i can put ye in a wai
of find it out befor ye bind yourself to it past back out clap
ey on captain ahab young man and thou wilt find that he ha onli on
leg
what do you mean sir wa the other on lost by a whale
lost by a whale young man come nearer to me it wa devour chew
up crunch by the monstrousest parmacetti that ever chip a
boatah ah
i wa a littl alarm by hi energi perhap also a littl touch at
the hearti grief in hi conclud exclam but said as calmli as i
could what you sai is no doubt true enough sir but how could i know
there wa ani peculiar feroc in that particular whale though inde
i might have infer as much from the simpl fact of the accid
look ye now young man thy lung ar a sort of soft dye see thou
dost not talk shark a bit sure yeve been to sea befor now sure
of that
sir said i i thought i told you that i had been four voyag in
the merchant
hard down out of that mind what i said about the marchant
servicedont aggrav mei wont have it but let us understand each
other i have given thee a hint about what whale is do ye yet feel
inclin for it
i do sir
veri good now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live
whale throat and then jump after it answer quick
i am sir if it should be posit indispens to do so not to
be got rid of that is which i dont take to be the fact
good again now then thou not onli wantest to go awhal to find
out by experi what whale is but ye also want to go in order to
see the world wa not that what ye said i thought so well then just
step forward there and take a peep over the weatherbow and then back
to me and tell me what ye see there
for a moment i stood a littl puzzl by thi curiou request not
know exactli how to take it whether humor or in earnest but
concentr all hi crow feet into on scowl captain peleg start
me on the errand
go forward and glanc over the weather bow i perceiv that the
ship swing to her anchor with the floodtid wa now obliqu
point toward the open ocean the prospect wa unlimit but
exceedingli monoton and forbid not the slightest varieti that i
could see
well what the report said peleg when i came back what did ye
see
not much i repliednoth but water consider horizon though
and there a squall come up i think
well what dost thou think then of see the world do ye wish to go
round cape horn to see ani more of it eh cant ye see the world where
you stand
i wa a littl stagger but go awhal i must and i would and the
pequod wa as good a ship as anyi thought the bestand all thi i now
repeat to peleg see me so determin he express hi
willing to ship me
and thou mayest as well sign the paper right off he addedcom
along with ye and so sai he led the wai below deck into the
cabin
seat on the transom wa what seem to me a most uncommon and
surpris figur it turn out to be captain bildad who along with
captain peleg wa on of the largest owner of the vessel the other
share as is sometim the case in these port be held by a crowd
of old annuit widow fatherless children and chanceri ward
each own about the valu of a timber head or a foot of plank or a
nail or two in the ship peopl in nantucket invest their monei in
whale vessel the same wai that you do your in approv state
stock bring in good interest
now bildad like peleg and inde mani other nantucket wa a
quaker the island have been origin settl by that sect and to
thi dai it inhabit in gener retain in an uncommon measur the
peculiar of the quaker onli various and anomal modifi by
thing altogeth alien and heterogen for some of these same
quaker ar the most sanguinari of all sailor and whalehunt thei
ar fight quaker thei ar quaker with a vengeanc
so that there ar instanc among them of men who name with
scriptur namesa singularli common fashion on the islandand in
childhood natur imbib the state dramat thee and thou of the
quaker idiom still from the audaci dare and boundless
adventur of their subsequ live strang blend with these
unoutgrown peculiar a thousand bold dash of charact not
unworthi a scandinavian seak or a poetic pagan roman and when
these thing unit in a man of greatli superior natur forc with a
globular brain and a ponder heart who ha also by the still and
seclus of mani long nightwatch in the remotest water and
beneath constel never seen here at the north been led to think
untradition and independ receiv all natur sweet or
savag impress fresh from her own virgin voluntari and confid
breast and therebi chiefli but with some help from accident
advantag to learn a bold and nervou lofti languagethat man make
on in a whole nation censusa mighti pageant creatur form for

regard if either by birth or other circumst he have what seem
a half wil overrul morbid at the bottom of hi natur for
all men tragic great ar made so through a certain morbid be
sure of thi o young ambit all mortal great is but diseas
but as yet we have not to do with such an on but with quit anoth
and still a man who if inde peculiar it onli result again from
anoth phase of the quaker modifi by individu circumst
like captain peleg captain bildad wa a welltodo retir whaleman
but unlik captain pelegwho care not a rush for what ar call
seriou thing and inde deem those selfsam seriou thing the
veriest of all triflescaptain bildad had not onli been origin
educ accord to the strictest sect of nantucket quaker but
all hi subsequ ocean life and the sight of mani unclad love
island creatur round the hornal that had not move thi nativ
born quaker on singl jot had not so much as alter on angl of hi
vest still for all thi immut wa there some lack of common
consist about worthi captain bildad though refus from
conscienti scrupl to bear arm against land invad yet himself
had illimit invad the atlant and pacif and though a sworn
foe to human bloodsh yet had he in hi straightbodi coat spill
tun upon tun of leviathan gore how now in the contempl even
of hi dai the piou bildad reconcil these thing in the
reminisc i do not know but it did not seem to concern him much
and veri probabl he had long sinc come to the sage and sensibl
conclus that a man religion is on thing and thi practic world
quit anoth thi world pai dividend rise from a littl
cabinboi in short cloth of the drabbest drab to a harpoon in a
broad shadbelli waistcoat from that becom boathead
chiefmat and captain and final a shipown bildad as i hint
befor had conclud hi adventur career by wholli retir from
activ life at the goodli ag of sixti and dedic hi remain
dai to the quiet receiv of hi wellearn incom
now bildad i am sorri to sai had the reput of be an
incorrig old hunk and in hi seago dai a bitter hard
taskmast thei told me in nantucket though it certainli seem a
curiou stori that when he sail the old categut whaleman hi crew
upon arriv home were mostli all carri ashor to the hospit
sore exhaust and worn out for a piou man especi for a quaker
he wa certainli rather hardheart to sai the least he never us to
swear though at hi men thei said but somehow he got an inordin
quantiti of cruel unmitig hard work out of them when bildad wa a
chiefmat to have hi drabcolor ey intent look at you made
you feel complet nervou till you could clutch somethinga hammer
or a marlingspik and go to work like mad at someth or other
never mind what indol and idl perish from befor him hi
own person wa the exact embodi of hi utilitarian charact on
hi long gaunt bodi he carri no spare flesh no superflu beard
hi chin have a soft econom nap to it like the worn nap of hi
broadbrim hat
such then wa the person that i saw seat on the transom when i
follow captain peleg down into the cabin the space between the deck
wa small and there boltupright sat old bildad who alwai sat so
and never lean and thi to save hi coat tail hi broadbrim wa
place besid him hi leg were stiffli cross hi drab vestur wa
button up to hi chin and spectacl on nose he seem absorb in
read from a ponder volum
bildad cri captain peleg at it again bildad eh ye have been
studi those scriptur now for the last thirti year to my
certain knowledg how far ye got bildad
as if long habitu to such profan talk from hi old shipmat
bildad without notic hi present irrever quietli look up
and see me glanc again inquiringli toward peleg
he sai he our man bildad said peleg he want to ship
dost thee said bildad in a hollow tone and turn round to me
i dost said i unconsci he wa so intens a quaker
what do ye think of him bildad said peleg
hell do said bildad ey me and then went on spell awai at
hi book in a mumbl tone quit audibl
i thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw especi as peleg
hi friend and old shipmat seem such a bluster but i said
noth onli look round me sharpli peleg now threw open a chest
and draw forth the ship articl place pen and ink befor him
and seat himself at a littl tabl i began to think it wa high time
to settl with myself at what term i would be will to engag for
the voyag i wa alreadi awar that in the whale busi thei paid
no wage but all hand includ the captain receiv certain share
of the profit call lai and that these lai were proport to
the degre of import pertain to the respect duti of the
ship compani i wa also awar that be a green hand at whale my
own lai would not be veri larg but consid that i wa us to the
sea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that i made no doubt
that from all i had heard i should be offer at least the 275th
laythat is the 275th part of the clear nett proce of the voyag
whatev that might eventu amount to and though the 275th lai wa
what thei call a rather long lai yet it wa better than noth and
if we had a lucki voyag might pretti nearli pai for the cloth i
would wear out on it not to speak of my three year beef and board
for which i would not have to pai on stiver
it might be thought that thi wa a poor wai to accumul a princ
fortuneand so it wa a veri poor wai inde but i am on of those
that never take on about princ fortun and am quit content if the
world is readi to board and lodg me while i am put up at thi
grim sign of the thunder cloud upon the whole i thought that the
275th lai would be about the fair thing but would not have been
surpris had i been offer the 200th consid i wa of a
broadshould make
but on thing nevertheless that made me a littl distrust about
receiv a gener share of the profit wa thi ashor i had heard
someth of both captain peleg and hi unaccount old croni bildad
how that thei be the princip proprietor of the pequod therefor
the other and more inconsider and scatter owner left nearli the
whole manag of the ship affair to these two and i did not know
but what the stingi old bildad might have a mighti deal to sai about
ship hand especi as i now found him on board the pequod
quit at home there in the cabin and read hi bibl as if at hi
own firesid now while peleg wa vainli try to mend a pen with hi
jackknif old bildad to my no small surpris consid that he
wa such an interest parti in these proceed bildad never heed
us but went on mumbl to himself out of hi book lai not up for
yourselv treasur upon earth where moth
well captain bildad interrupt peleg what dye sai what lai
shall we give thi young man
thou knowest best wa the sepulchr repli the seven hundr and
seventyseventh wouldnt be too much would itwher moth and rust do
corrupt but lai
lai inde thought i and such a lai the seven hundr and
seventyseventh well old bildad you ar determin that i for on
shall not lai up mani lai here below where moth and rust do
corrupt it wa an exceedingli long lai that inde and though from
the magnitud of the figur it might at first deceiv a landsman yet
the slightest consider will show that though seven hundr and
seventyseven is a pretti larg number yet when you come to make a
teenth of it you will then see i sai that the seven hundr and
seventyseventh part of a farth is a good deal less than seven
hundr and seventyseven gold doubloon and so i thought at the time
why blast your ey bildad cri peleg thou dost not want to
swindl thi young man he must have more than that
seven hundr and seventyseventh again said bildad without lift
hi ey and then went on mumblingfor where your treasur is there
will your heart be also
i am go to put him down for the three hundredth said peleg do
ye hear that bildad the three hundredth lai i sai
bildad laid down hi book and turn solemnli toward him said
captain peleg thou hast a gener heart but thou must consid the
duti thou owest to the other owner of thi shipwidow and orphan
mani of themand that if we too abundantli reward the labor of thi
young man we mai be take the bread from those widow and those
orphan the seven hundr and seventyseventh lai captain peleg
thou bildad roar peleg start up and clatter about the
cabin blast ye captain bildad if i had follow thy advic in these
matter i would afor now had a conscienc to lug about that would be
heavi enough to founder the largest ship that ever sail round cape
horn
captain peleg said bildad steadili thy conscienc mai be draw
ten inch of water or ten fathom i cant tell but as thou art
still an impenit man captain peleg i greatli fear lest thy
conscienc be but a leaki on and will in the end sink thee founder
down to the fieri pit captain peleg
fieri pit fieri pit ye insult me man past all natur bear ye
insult me it an allfir outrag to tell ani human creatur that
he bound to hell fluke and flame bildad sai that again to me
and start my soulbolt but illilly ill swallow a live goat
with all hi hair and horn on out of the cabin ye cant
drabcolor son of a wooden guna straight wake with ye
as he thunder out thi he made a rush at bildad but with a
marvel obliqu slide celer bildad for that time elud him
alarm at thi terribl outburst between the two princip and
respons owner of the ship and feel half a mind to give up all
idea of sail in a vessel so question own and temporarili
command i step asid from the door to give egress to bildad who
i made no doubt wa all eager to vanish from befor the awaken
wrath of peleg but to my astonish he sat down again on the
transom veri quietli and seem to have not the slightest intent of
withdraw he seem quit us to impenit peleg and hi wai as
for peleg after let off hi rage as he had there seem no more
left in him and he too sat down like a lamb though he twitch a
littl as if still nervous agit whew he whistl at lastth
squall gone off to leeward i think bildad thou us to be good at
sharpen a lanc mend that pen will ye my jackknif here need
the grindston that he thank ye bildad now then my young man
ishmael thy name didnt ye sai well then down ye go here ishmael
for the three hundredth lai
captain peleg said i i have a friend with me who want to ship
tooshal i bring him down tomorrow
to be sure said peleg fetch him along and well look at him
what lai doe he want groan bildad glanc up from the book in
which he had again been buri himself
oh never thee mind about that bildad said peleg ha he ever
whale it ani turn to me
kill more whale than i can count captain peleg
well bring him along then
and after sign the paper off i went noth doubt but that i
had done a good morn work and that the pequod wa the ident
ship that yojo had provid to carri queequeg and me round the cape
but i had not proceed far when i began to bethink me that the
captain with whom i wa to sail yet remain unseen by me though
inde in mani case a whaleship will be complet fit out and
receiv all her crew on board er the captain make himself visibl by
arriv to take command for sometim these voyag ar so prolong
and the shore interv at home so exceedingli brief that if the
captain have a famili or ani absorb concern of that sort he
doe not troubl himself much about hi ship in port but leav her to
the owner till all is readi for sea howev it is alwai as well to
have a look at him befor irrevoc commit yourself into hi
hand turn back i accost captain peleg inquir where captain
ahab wa to be found
and what dost thou want of captain ahab it all right enough thou
art ship
ye but i should like to see him
but i dont think thou wilt be abl to at present i dont know
exactli what the matter with him but he keep close insid the
hous a sort of sick and yet he dont look so in fact he aint
sick but no he isnt well either ani how young man he wont alwai
see me so i dont suppos he will thee he a queer man captain

than the wave fix hi fieri lanc in mightier stranger foe than
whale hi lanc ay the keenest and the surest that out of all our
isl oh he aint captain bildad no and he aint captain peleg
he ahab boi and ahab of old thou knowest wa a crown king
and a veri vile on when that wick king wa slain the dog did
thei not lick hi blood
come hither to mehith hither said peleg with a signific in
hi ey that almost startl me look ye lad never sai that on board
the pequod never sai it anywher captain ahab did not name himself
twa a foolish ignor whim of hi crazi widow mother who di
when he wa onli a twelvemonth old and yet the old squaw tistig at
gayhead said that the name would somehow prove prophet and
perhap other fool like her mai tell thee the same i wish to warn
thee it a lie i know captain ahab well iv sail with him as
mate year ago i know what he isa good mannot a piou good man
like bildad but a swear good mansometh like meonli there a
good deal more of him ay ay i know that he wa never veri jolli
and i know that on the passag home he wa a littl out of hi mind
for a spell but it wa the sharp shoot pain in hi bleed stump
that brought that about as ani on might see i know too that ever
sinc he lost hi leg last voyag by that accurs whale he been a
kind of moodydesper moodi and savag sometim but that will all
pass off and onc for all let me tell thee and assur thee young
man it better to sail with a moodi good captain than a laugh bad
on so goodby to theeand wrong not captain ahab becaus he happen
to have a wick name besid my boi he ha a wifenot three voyag
weddeda sweet resign girl think of that by that sweet girl that
old man ha a child hold ye then there can be ani utter hopeless harm
in ahab no no my lad stricken blast if he be ahab ha hi
human
as i walk awai i wa full of thought what had been
incident reveal to me of captain ahab fill me with a certain
wild vagu of pain concern him and somehow at the time
i felt a sympathi and a sorrow for him but for i dont know what
unless it wa the cruel loss of hi leg and yet i also felt a strang
aw of him but that sort of aw which i cannot at all describ wa
not exactli aw i do not know what it wa but i felt it and it did
not disinclin me toward him though i felt impati at what seem
like mysteri in him so imperfectli as he wa known to me then
howev my thought were at length carri in other direct so
that for the present dark ahab slip my mind
chapter xvii the ramadan
as queequeg ramadan or fast and humili wa to continu all
dai i did not choos to disturb him till toward nightfal for i
cherish the greatest respect toward everybodi religi oblig
never mind how comic and could not find it in my heart to undervalu
even a congreg of ant worship a toadstool or those other
creatur in certain part of our earth who with a degre of
footman quit unpreced in other planet bow down befor the
torso of a deceas land proprietor mere on account of the
inordin possess yet own and rent in hi name
i sai we good presbyterian christian should be charit in these
thing and not fanci ourselv so vastli superior to other mortal
pagan and what not becaus of their halfcrazi conceit on these
subject there wa queequeg now certainli entertain the most
absurd notion about yojo and hi ramadanbut what of that queequeg
thought he knew what he wa about i suppos he seem to be content
and there let him rest all our argu with him would not avail let
him be i sai and heaven have merci on us allpresbyterian and pagan
alikefor we ar all somehow dreadfulli crack about the head and
sadli need mend
toward even when i felt assur that all hi perform and

time i thought he might have had an apoplect fit i look through
the keyhol but the door open into an odd corner of the room the
keyhol prospect wa but a crook and sinist on i could onli see
part of the footboard of the bed and a line of the wall but noth
more i wa surpris to behold rest against the wall the wooden
shaft of queequeg harpoon which the landladi the even previou
had taken from him befor our mount to the chamber that strang
thought i but at ani rate sinc the harpoon stand yonder and he
seldom or never goe abroad without it therefor he must be insid

littl for a good start when the landladi caught at me again vow
i should not break down her premis but i tore from her and with a
sudden bodili rush dash myself full against the mark
with a prodigi nois the door flew open and the knob slam
against the wall sent the plaster to the ceil and there good
heaven there sat queequeg altogeth cool and selfcollect right
in the middl of the room squat on hi ham and hold yojo on
top of hi head he look neither on wai nor the other wai but sat
like a carv imag with scarc a sign of activ life
queequeg said i go up to him queequeg what the matter with
you
he haint been a sittin so all dai ha he said the landladi
but all we said not a word could we drag out of him i almost felt
like push him over so as to chang hi posit for it wa almost
intoler it seem so painfulli and unnatur constrain
especi as in all probabl he had been sit so for upward of
eight or ten hour go too without hi regular meal
mr hussei said i he aliv at all event so leav us if you
pleas and i will see to thi strang affair myself
close the door upon the landladi i endeavor to prevail upon
queequeg to take a chair but in vain there he sat and all he could
dofor all my polit art and blandishmentsh would not move a peg
nor sai a singl word nor even look at me nor notic my presenc in
ani the slightest wai
i wonder thought i if thi can possibl be a part of hi ramadan do
thei fast on their ham that wai in hi nativ island it must be so
ye it part of hi creed i suppos well then let him rest hell
get up sooner or later no doubt it cant last for ever thank god
and hi ramadan onli come onc a year and i dont believ it veri
punctual then
i went down to supper after sit a long time listen to the long
stori of some sailor who had just come from a plumpud voyag
as thei call it that is a short whalingvoyag in a schooner or
brig confin to the north of the line in the atlant ocean onli
after listen to these plumpudding till nearli eleven oclock i
went up stair to go to bed feel quit sure by thi time queequeg
must certainli have brought hi ramadan to a termin but no there
he wa just where i had left him he had not stir an inch i began
to grow vex with him it seem so downright senseless and insan to
be sit there all dai and half the night on hi ham in a cold room
hold a piec of wood on hi head
for heaven sake queequeg get up and shake yourself get up and
have some supper youll starv youll kill yourself queequeg but
not a word did he repli
despair of him therefor i determin to go to bed and to sleep
and no doubt befor a great while he would follow me but previou to
turn in i took my heavi bearskin jacket and threw it over him as
it promis to be a veri cold night and he had noth but hi
ordinari round jacket on for some time do all i would i could not
get into the faintest doze i had blown out the candl and the mere
thought of queequegnot four feet offsit there in that uneasi
posit stark alon in the cold and dark thi made me realli
wretch think of it sleep all night in the same room with a wide
awak pagan on hi ham in thi dreari unaccount ramadan
but somehow i drop off at last and knew noth more till break of
dai when look over the bedsid there squat queequeg as if he
had been screw down to the floor but as soon as the first glimps of
sun enter the window up he got with stiff and grate joint but
with a cheer look limp toward me where i lai press hi
forehead again against mine and said hi ramadan wa over
now as i befor hint i have no object to ani person religion
be it what it mai so long as that person doe not kill or insult ani
other person becaus that other person dont believ it also but when
a man religion becom realli frantic when it is a posit torment
to him and in fine make thi earth of our an uncomfort inn to
lodg in then i think it high time to take that individu asid and
argu the point with him
and just so i now did with queequeg queequeg said i get into bed
now and lie and listen to me i then went on begin with the rise
and progress of the primit religion and come down to the variou
religion of the present time dure which time i labor to show
queequeg that all these lent ramadan and prolong hamsquat
in cold cheerless room were stark nonsens bad for the health
useless for the soul oppos in short to the obviou law of hygien
and common sens i told him too that he be in other thing such
an extrem sensibl and sagaci savag it pain me veri badli
pain me to see him now so deplor foolish about thi ridicul
ramadan of hi besid argu i fast make the bodi cave in
henc the spirit cave in and all thought born of a fast must
necessarili be halfstarv thi is the reason why most dyspept
religionist cherish such melancholi notion about their hereaft in
on word queequeg said i rather digress hell is an idea first
born on an undigest appledumpl and sinc then perpetu
through the hereditari dyspepsia nurtur by ramadan
i then ask queequeg whether he himself wa ever troubl with
dyspepsia express the idea veri plainli so that he could take it
in he said no onli upon on memor occas it wa after a great
feast given by hi father the king on the gain of a great battl
wherein fifti of the enemi had been kill by about two oclock in the
afternoon and all cook and eaten that veri even
no more queequeg said i shudder that will do for i knew the
infer without hi further hint them i had seen a sailor who
had visit that veri island and he told me that it wa the custom
when a great battl had been gain there to barbecu all the slain in
the yard or garden of the victor and then on by on thei were
place in great wooden trencher and garnish round like a pilau
with breadfruit and cocoanut and with some parslei in their mouth
were sent round with the victor compliment to all hi friend just
as though these present were so mani christma turkei
after all i do not think that my remark about religion made much
impress upon queequeg becaus in the first place he somehow
seem dull of hear on that import subject unless consid
from hi own point of view and in the second place he did not more
than on third understand me couch my idea simpli as i would and
final he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true
religion than i did he look at me with a sort of condescend
concern and compass as though he thought it a great piti that such
a sensibl young man should be so hopelessli lost to evangel pagan
pieti
at last we rose and dress and queequeg take a prodigi hearti
breakfast of chowder of all sort so that the landladi should not
make much profit by reason of hi ramadan we salli out to board the
pequod saunter along and pick our teeth with halibut bone

elijah thought i and we walk awai both comment after each
other fashion upon thi rag old sailor and agre that he wa
noth but a humbug try to be a bugbear but we had not gone
perhap abov a hundr yard when chanc to turn a corner and
look back as i did so who should be seen but elijah follow us
though at a distanc somehow the sight of him struck me so that i
said noth to queequeg of hi be behind but pass on with my
comrad anxiou to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner
that we did he did and then it seem to me that he wa dog us
but with what intent i could not for the life of me imagin thi
circumst coupl with hi ambigu halfhint halfrev
shroud sort of talk now begat in me all kind of vagu wonder
and halfapprehens and all connect with the pequod and captain
ahab and the leg he had lost and the cape horn fit and the silver
calabash and what captain peleg had said of him when i left the ship
the dai previou and the predict of the squaw tistig and the
voyag we had bound ourselv to sail and a hundr other shadowi
thing
i wa resolv to satisfi myself whether thi rag elijah wa realli
dog us or not and with that intent cross the wai with queequeg
and on that side of it retrac our step but elijah pass on
without seem to notic us thi reliev me and onc more and
final as it seem to me i pronounc him in my heart a humbug
chapter xx all astir
a dai or two pass and there wa great activ aboard the pequod
not onli were the old sail be mend but new sail were come on
board and bolt of canva and coil of rig in short everyth
betoken that the ship prepar were hurri to a close
captain peleg seldom or never went ashor but sat in hi wigwam
keep a sharp lookout upon the hand bildad did all the purchas
and provid at the store and the men emploi in the hold and on
the rig were work till long after nightfal
on the dai follow queequeg sign the articl word wa given at
all the inn where the ship compani were stop that their chest
must be on board befor night for there wa no tell how soon the
vessel might be sail so queequeg and i got down our trap
resolv howev to sleep ashor till the last but it seem thei
alwai give veri long notic in these case and the ship did not sail
for sever dai but no wonder there wa a good deal to be done and
there is no tell how mani thing to be thought of befor the pequod
wa fulli equip
everi on know what a multitud of thingsb saucepan knive and
fork shovel and tong napkin nutcrack and what not ar
indispens to the busi of housekeep just so with whale
which necessit a threeyear housekeep upon the wide ocean far
from all grocer costermong doctor baker and banker and
though thi also hold true of merchant vessel yet not by ani mean
to the same extent as with whalemen for besid the great length of
the whale voyag the numer articl peculiar to the prosecut
of the fisheri and the imposs of replac them at the remot
harbor usual frequent it must be rememb that of all ship
whale vessel ar the most expos to accid of all kind and
especi to the destruct and loss of the veri thing upon which
the success of the voyag most depend henc the spare boat spare
spar and spare line and harpoon and spare everyth almost but
a spare captain and duplic ship
at the period of our arriv at the island the heaviest storag of the
pequod had been almost complet compris her beef bread water
fuel and iron hoop and stave but as befor hint for some time
there wa a continu fetch and carri on board of diver odd and
end of thing both larg and small
chief among those who did thi fetch and carri wa captain
bildad sister a lean old ladi of a most determin and indefatig
spirit but withal veri kindheart who seem resolv that if she
could help it noth should be found want in the pequod after
onc fairli get to sea at on time she would come on board with a
jar of pickl for the steward pantri anoth time with a bunch of
quill for the chief mate desk where he kept hi log a third time
with a roll of flannel for the small of some on rheumat back
never did ani woman better deserv her name which wa charityaunt
chariti as everybodi call her and like a sister of chariti did thi
charit aunt chariti bustl about hither and thither readi to turn
her hand and heart to anyth that promis to yield safeti comfort
and consol to all on board a ship in which her belov brother
bildad wa concern and in which she herself own a score or two of
wellsav dollar
but it wa startl to see thi excel heart quakeress come on
board as she did the last dai with a long oilladl in on hand and
a still longer whale lanc in the other nor wa bildad himself nor
captain peleg at all backward as for bildad he carri about with him
a long list of the articl need and at everi fresh arriv down
went hi mark opposit that articl upon the paper everi onc and a
while peleg came hobbl out of hi whalebon den roar at the men
down the hatchwai roar up to the rigger at the masthead and
then conclud by roar back into hi wigwam
dure these dai of prepar queequeg and i often visit the
craft and as often i ask about captain ahab and how he wa and
when he wa go to come on board hi ship to these question thei
would answer that he wa get better and better and wa expect
aboard everi dai meantim the two captain peleg and bildad could
attend to everyth necessari to fit the vessel for the voyag if i
had been downright honest with myself i would have seen veri plainli
in my heart that i did but half fanci be commit thi wai to so
long a voyag without onc lai my ey on the man who wa to be the
absolut dictat of it so soon as the ship sail out upon the open
sea but when a man suspect ani wrong it sometim happen that if he
be alreadi involv in the matter he insens strive to cover up
hi suspicion even from himself and much thi wai it wa with me i
said noth and tri to think noth
at last it wa given out that some time next dai the ship would
certainli sail so next morn queequeg and i took a veri earli
start
chapter xxi go aboard
it wa nearli six oclock but onli grei imperfect misti dawn when we
drew nigh the wharf
there ar some sailor run ahead there if i see right said i to
queequeg it cant be shadow she off by sunris i guess come
on
avast cri a voic whose owner at the same time come close
behind us laid a hand upon both our shoulder and then insinu
himself between us stood stoop forward a littl in the uncertain
twilight strang peer from queequeg to me it wa elijah
go aboard
hand off will you said i
looke here said queequeg shake himself go wai

know mr elijah that i consid you a littl impertin
no no no i wasnt awar of that said elijah slowli and
wonderingli look from me to queequeg with the most unaccount
glanc
elijah said i you will oblig my friend and me by withdraw we
ar go to the indian and pacif ocean and would prefer not to be
detain
ye be be ye come back afor breakfast
he crack queequeg said i come on
holloa cri stationari elijah hail us when we had remov a few
pace
never mind him said i queequeg come on
but he stole up to us again and suddenli clap hi hand on my
shoulder saiddid ye see anyth look like men go toward that
ship a while ago
struck by thi plain matteroffact question i answer sai ye
i thought i did see four or five men but it wa too dim to be sure
veri dim veri dim said elijah morn to ye
onc more we quit him but onc more he came softli after us and
touch my shoulder again said see if you can find em now will

wa go to warn ye againstbut never mind never mindit all on
all in the famili toosharp frost thi morn aint it good bye to
ye shant see ye again veri soon i guess unless it befor the
grand juri and with these crack word he final depart leav
me for the moment in no small wonder at hi frantic impud
at last step on board the pequod we found everyth in profound
quiet not a soul move the cabin entranc wa lock within the
hatch were all on and lumber with coil of rig go forward
to the forecastl we found the slide of the scuttl open see a
light we went down and found onli an old rigger there wrap in a
tatter peajacket he wa thrown at whole length upon two chest hi
face downward and inclos in hi fold arm the profoundest slumber
slept upon him
those sailor we saw queequeg where can thei have gone to said i
look dubious at the sleeper but it seem that when on the
wharf queequeg had not at all notic what i now allud to henc i
would have thought myself to have been optic deceiv in that
matter were it not for elijah otherwis inexplic question but i
beat the thing down and again mark the sleeper jocularli hint to
queequeg that perhap we had best sit up with the bodi tell him to
establish himself accordingli he put hi hand upon the sleeper rear
as though feel if it wa soft enough and then without more ado
sat quietli down there
graciou queequeg dont sit there said i
oh perri dood seat said queequeg my countri wai wont hurt him
face
face said i call that hi face veri benevol counten then
but how hard he breath he heav himself get off queequeg you
ar heavi it grind the face of the poor get off queequeg look
hell twitch you off soon i wonder he dont wake
queequeg remov himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper and
light hi tomahawk pipe i sat at the feet we kept the pipe pass
over the sleeper from on to the other meanwhil upon question
him in hi broken fashion queequeg gave me to understand that in hi
land ow to the absenc of sette and sofa of all sort the king
chief and great peopl gener were in the custom of fatten
some of the lower order for ottoman and to furnish a hous
comfort in that respect you had onli to bui up eight or ten lazi
fellow and lai them round in the pier and alcov besid it wa
veri conveni on an excurs much better than those gardenchair
which ar convert into walkingstick upon occas a chief
call hi attend and desir him to make a sette of himself
under a spread tree perhap in some damp marshi place
while narrat these thing everi time queequeg receiv the tomahawk
from me he flourish the hatchetsid of it over the sleeper head
what that for queequeg
perri easi kill oh perri easi
he wa go on with some wild reminisc about hi tomahawkpip
which it seem had in it two us both brain hi foe and sooth
hi soul when we were directli attract to the sleep rigger the
strong vapor now complet fill the contract hole it began to
tell upon him he breath with a sort of muffled then seem
troubl in the nose then revolv over onc or twice then sat up and
rub hi ey
holloa he breath at last who be ye smoker
ship men answer i when doe she sail
ay ay ye ar go in her be ye she sail todai the captain
came aboard last night
what captainahab
who but him inde
i wa go to ask him some further question concern ahab when we
heard a nois on deck
holloa starbuck astir said the rigger he a live chief mate
that good man and a piou but all aliv now i must turn to and so
sai he went on deck and we follow

chapter xxii merri christma
at length toward noon upon the final dismiss of the ship
rigger and after the pequod had been haul out from the wharf and
after the everthought chariti had come off in a whaleboat with her
last gifta nightcap for stubb the second mate her brotherinlaw
and a spare bibl for the stewardaft all thi the two captain
peleg and bildad issu from the cabin and turn to the chief mate
peleg said
now mr starbuck ar you sure everyth is right captain ahab is
all readyjust spoke to himnoth more to be got from shore eh
well call all hand then muster em aft hereblast em
no need of profan word howev great the hurri peleg said
bildad but awai with thee friend starbuck and do our bid
how now here upon the veri point of start for the voyag captain
peleg and captain bildad were go it with a high hand on the
quarterdeck just as if thei were to be jointcommand at sea as
well as to all appear in port and as for captain ahab no sign
of him wa yet to be seen onli thei said he wa in the cabin but
then the idea wa that hi presenc wa by no mean necessari in
get the ship under weigh and steer her well out to sea inde
as that wa not at all hi proper busi but the pilot and as he
wa not yet complet recoveredso thei saidtherefor captain ahab
stai below and all thi seem natur enough especi as in the
merchant servic mani captain never show themselv on deck for a
consider time after heav up the anchor but remain over the
cabin tabl have a farewel merrymak with their shore friend
befor thei quit the ship for good with the pilot
but there wa not much chanc to think over the matter for captain
peleg wa now all aliv he seem to do most of the talk and
command and not bildad
aft here ye son of bachelor he cri as the sailor linger at
the mainmast mr starbuck drive em aft
strike the tent therewa the next order as i hint befor thi
whalebon marque wa never pitch except in port and on board the
pequod for thirti year the order to strike the tent wa well known
to be the next thing to heav up the anchor
man the capstan blood and thunderjumpwa the next command and
the crew sprang for the handspik
now in get under weigh the station gener occupi by the
pilot is the forward part of the ship and here bildad who with
peleg be it known in addit to hi other offic wa on of the
licens pilot of the porth be suspect to have got himself made
a pilot in order to save the nantucket pilotfe to all the ship he
wa concern in for he never pilot ani other craftbildad i sai
might now be seen activ engag in look over the bow for the
approach anchor and at interv sing what seem a dismal stave
of psalmodi to cheer the hand at the windlass who roar forth some
sort of a choru about the girl in boobl allei with hearti good
will nevertheless not three dai previou bildad had told them that
no profan song would be allow on board the pequod particularli in
get under weigh and chariti hi sister had place a small choic
copi of watt in each seaman berth
meantim overse the other part of the ship captain peleg rip
and swore astern in the most fright manner i almost thought he
would sink the ship befor the anchor could be got up involuntarili i
paus on my handspik and told queequeg to do the same think of
the peril we both ran in start on the voyag with such a devil for
a pilot i wa comfort myself howev with the thought that in
piou bildad might be found some salvat spite of hi seven hundr
and seventyseventh lai when i felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear
and turn round wa horrifi at the apparit of captain peleg in
the act of withdraw hi leg from my immedi vicin that wa my
first kick
is that the wai thei heav in the marchant servic he roar
spring thou sheephead spring and break thy backbon why dont ye
spring i sai all of yespr quohog spring thou chap with the red
whisker spring there scotchcap spring thou green pant spring i
sai all of ye and spring your ey out and so sai he move
along the windlass here and there us hi leg veri freeli while
imperturb bildad kept lead off with hi psalmodi think i
captain peleg must have been drink someth todai
at last the anchor wa up the sail were set and off we glide it
wa a short cold christma and as the short northern dai merg into
night we found ourselv almost broad upon the wintri ocean whose
freez sprai case us in ic as in polish armor the long row of
teeth on the bulwark glisten in the moonlight and like the white
ivori tusk of some huge eleph vast curv icicl depend from
the bow
lank bildad as pilot head the first watch and ever and anon as
the old craft deep dive into the green sea and sent the shiver
frost all over her and the wind howl and the cordag rang hi
steadi note were heard
sweet field beyond the swell flood
stand dress in live green
so to the jew old canaan stood
while jordan roll between
never did those sweet word sound more sweetli to me than then thei
were full of hope and fruition spite of thi frigid winter night in
the boister atlant spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket there
wa yet it then seem to me mani a pleasant haven in store and
mead and glade so etern vernal that the grass shot up by the
spring untrodden unwilt remain at midsumm
at last we gain such an of that the two pilot were need no
longer the stout sailboat that had accompani us began rang
alongsid
it wa curiou and not unpleas how peleg and bildad were affect
at thi junctur especi captain bildad for loath to depart yet
veri loath to leav for good a ship bound on so long and peril a
voyagebeyond both stormi cape a ship in which some thousand of hi
hard earn dollar were invest a ship in which an old shipmat
sail as captain a man almost as old as he onc more start to
encount all the terror of the pitiless jaw loath to sai goodby to
a thing so everi wai brim of everi interest to himpoor old bildad
linger long pace the deck with anxiou stride ran down into the
cabin to speak anoth farewel word there again came on deck and
look to windward look toward the wide and endless water onli
bound by the faroff unseen eastern contin look toward the
land look aloft look right and left look everywher and
nowher and at last mechan coil a rope upon it pin
convuls grasp stout peleg by the hand and hold up a lantern
for a moment stood gaze heroic in hi face as much as to sai
nevertheless friend peleg i can stand it ye i can
as for peleg himself he took it more like a philosoph but for all
hi philosophi there wa a tear twinkl in hi ey when the lantern
came too near and he too did not a littl run from cabin to decknow

chapter xxiii the lee shore
some chapter back on bulkington wa spoken of a tall newland
marin encount in new bedford at the inn
when on that shiver winter night the pequod thrust her vindict
bow into the cold malici wave who should i see stand at her

the man who in midwint just land from a four year danger
voyag could so unrestingli push off again for still anoth
tempestu term the land seem scorch to hi feet wonderfullest
thing ar ever the unmention deep memori yield no epitaph
thi sixinch chapter is the stoneless grave of bulkington let me onli

succor the port is piti in the port is safeti comfort
hearthston supper warm blanket friend all that kind to our

direst jeopardi she must fly all hospit on touch of land
though it but graze the keel would make her shudder through and
through with all her might she crowd all sail off shore in so do
fight gainst the veri wind that fain would blow her homeward seek
all the lash sea landless again for refug sake forlornli
rush into peril her onli friend her bitterest foe
know ye now bulkington glimps do ye seem to see of that mortal
intoler truth that all deep earnest think is but the intrepid
effort of the soul to keep the open independ of her sea while the
wildest wind of heaven and earth conspir to cast her on the
treacher slavish shore
but as in landless alon resid the highest truth shoreless

chapter xxiv the advoc
as queequeg and i ar now fairli embark in thi busi of whale
and as thi busi of whale ha somehow come to be regard among
landsmen as a rather unpoet and disreput pursuit therefor i
am all anxieti to convinc ye ye landsmen of the injustic herebi
done to us hunter of whale
in the first place it mai be deem almost superflu to establish
the fact that among peopl at larg the busi of whale is not
account on a level with what ar call the liber profess if a
stranger were introduc into ani miscellan metropolitan societi
it would but slightli advanc the gener opinion of hi merit were
he present to the compani as a harpoon sai and if in emul
of the naval offic he should append the initi s w f sperm
whale fisheri to hi visit card such a procedur would be deem
preemin presum and ridicul
doubtless on lead reason why the world declin honor us
whalemen is thi thei think that at best our vocat amount to a
butcher sort of busi and that when activ engag therein we
ar surround by all manner of defil butcher we ar that is
true but butcher also and butcher of the bloodiest badg have been
all martial command whom the world invari delight to honor and
as for the matter of the alleg uncleanli of our busi ye
shall soon be initi into certain fact hitherto pretti gener
unknown and which upon the whole will triumphantli plant the sperm
whaleship at least among the cleanliest thing of thi tidi earth but
even grant the charg in question to be true what disord
slipperi deck of a whaleship ar compar to the unspeak
carrion of those battlefield from which so mani soldier return to
drink in all ladi plaudit and if the idea of peril so much
enhanc the popular conceit of the soldier profess let me assur
ye that mani a veteran who ha freeli march up to a batteri would
quickli recoil at the apparit of the sperm whale vast tail
fan into eddi the air over hi head for what ar the
comprehens terror of man compar with the interlink terror and
wonder of god
but though the world scout at us whale hunter yet doe it
unwittingli pai us the profoundest homag yea an allabound
ador for almost all the taper lamp and candl that burn
round the globe burn as befor so mani shrine to our glori
but look at thi matter in other light weigh it in all sort of
scale see what we whalemen ar and have been
why did the dutch in de witt time have admir of their whale
fleet why did loui xvi of franc at hi own person expens fit
out whale ship from dunkirk and polit invit to that town some
score or two of famili from our own island of nantucket why did
britain between the year 1750 and 1788 pai to her whalemen in bounti
upward of 1000000 and lastli how come it that we whalemen of
america now outnumb all the rest of the band whalemen in the world
sail a navi of upward of seven hundr vessel man by eighteen
thousand men yearli consum 4000000 of dollar the ship worth
at the time of sail 20000000 and everi year import into our
harbor a well reap harvest of 7000000 how come all thi if
there be not someth puissant in whale
but thi is not the half look again
i freeli assert that the cosmopolit philosoph cannot for hi life
point out on singl peac influenc which within the last sixti
year ha oper more potenti upon the whole broad world taken
in on aggreg than the high and mighti busi of whale on wai
and anoth it ha begotten event so remark in themselv and so
continu moment in their sequenti issu that whale mai
well be regard as that egyptian mother who bore offspr themselv
pregnant from her womb it would be a hopeless endless task to
catalogu all these thing let a hand suffic for mani year past
the whaleship ha been the pioneer in ferret out the remotest and
least known part of the earth she ha explor sea and archipelago
which had no chart where no cook or vancouv had ever sail if
american and european menofwar now peacefulli ride in onc savag
harbor let them fire salut to the honor and glori of the
whaleship which origin show them the wai and first interpret
between them and the savag thei mai celebr as thei will the
hero of explor expedit your cook your krusenstern but i
sai that score of anonym captain have sail out of nantucket
that were as great and greater than your cook and your krusenstern
for in their succorless emptyhanded thei in the heathenish
shark water and by the beach of unrecord javelin island
battl with virgin wonder and terror that cook with all hi marin
and musket would not willingli have dare all that is made such a
flourish of in the old south sea voyag those thing were but the

japan is ever to becom hospit it is the whaleship alon to whom
the credit will be due for alreadi she is on the threshold
but if in the face of all thi you still declar that whale ha no

chapter xxvi knight and squir
the chief mate of the pequod wa starbuck a nativ of nantucket and a

would not spoil like bottl al he must have been born in some time
of gener drought and famin or upon on of those fast dai for which
hi state is famou onli some thirti arid summer had he seen those
summer had dri up all hi physic superflu but thi hi
thin so to speak seem no more the token of wast anxieti

mere the condens of the man he wa by no mean illlook
quit the contrari hi pure tight skin wa an excel fit and
close wrap up in it and embalm with inner health and strength
like a revivifi egyptian thi starbuck seem prepar to endur for
long ag to come and to endur alwai as now for be it polar snow
or torrid sun like a patent chronomet hi interior vital wa
warrant to do well in all climat look into hi ey you seem
to see there the yet linger imag of those thousandfold peril he
had calmli confront through life a staid steadfast man whose life
for the most part wa a tell pantomim of action and not a tame
chapter of sound yet for all hi hardi sobrieti and fortitud there
were certain qualiti in him which at time affect and in some
case seem well nigh to overbal all the rest uncommonli
conscienti for a seaman and endu with a deep natur rever
the wild wateri loneli of hi life did therefor strongli inclin
him to superstit but to that sort of superstit which in some
organ seem rather to spring somehow from intellig than
from ignor outward portent and inward presenti were hi and
if at time these thing bent the weld iron of hi soul much more
did hi farawai domest memori of hi young cape wife and child
tend to bend him still more from the origin rugged of hi natur
and open him still further to those latent influenc which in some
honestheart men restrain the gush of daredevil dare so often
evinc by other in the more peril vicissitud of the fisheri i
will have no man in my boat said starbuck who is not afraid of a
whale by thi he seem to mean not onli that the most reliabl and
us courag wa that which aris from the fair estim of the
encount peril but that an utterli fearless man is a far more
danger comrad than a coward
ay ay said stubb the second mate starbuck there is as
care a man as youll find anywher in thi fisheri but we shall
er long see what that word care precis mean when us by a
man like stubb or almost ani other whale hunter
starbuck wa no crusad after peril in him courag wa not a
sentiment but a thing simpli us to him and alwai at hand upon
all mortal practic occas besid he thought perhap that in
thi busi of whale courag wa on of the great stapl outfit
of the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be foolishli
wast wherefor he had no fanci for lower for whale after
sundown nor for persist in fight a fish that too much persist
in fight him for thought starbuck i am here in thi critic
ocean to kill whale for my live and not to be kill by them for
their and that hundr of men had been so kill starbuck well knew
what doom wa hi own father where in the bottomless deep could
he find the torn limb of hi brother
with memori like these in him and moreov given to a certain
superstiti as ha been said the courag of thi starbuck which
could nevertheless still flourish must inde have been extrem but
it wa not in reason natur that a man so organ and with such
terribl experi and remembr as he had it wa not in natur
that these thing should fail in latent engend an element in
him which under suitabl circumst would break out from it
confin and burn all hi courag up and brave as he might be it
wa that sort of braveri chiefli visibl in some intrepid men which
while gener abid firm in the conflict with sea or wind or
whale or ani of the ordinari irrat horror of the world yet
cannot withstand those more terrif becaus more spiritu terror
which sometim menac you from the concentr brow of an enrag
and mighti man
but were the come narr to reveal in ani instanc the complet
abas of poor starbuck fortitud scarc might i have the heart
to write it for it is a thing most sorrow nai shock to expos
the fall of valor in the soul men mai seem detest as joint
stockcompani and nation knave fool and murder there mai be
men mai have mean and meagr face but man in the ideal is so nobl
and so sparkl such a grand and glow creatur that over ani
ignomini blemish in him all hi fellow should run to throw their
costliest robe that immacul manli we feel within ourselv so
far within us that it remain intact though all the outer charact
seem gone bleed with keenest anguish at the undrap spectacl of a
valorruin man nor can pieti itself at such a shame sight
complet stifl her upbraid against the permit star but
thi august digniti i treat of is not the digniti of king and robe

see it shine in the arm that wield a pick or drive a spike that
democrat digniti which on all hand radiat without end from god

no allus wa made to it especi by the mate but onc
tashtego senior an old gayhead indian among the crew
superstiti assert that not till he wa full forti year old did
ahab becom that wai brand and then it came upon him not in the
furi of ani mortal frai but in an element strife at sea yet thi
wild hint seem inferenti negativ by what a grei manxman
insinu an old sepulchr man who have never befor sail out
of nantucket had never er thi laid ey upon wild ahab nevertheless
the old seatradit the immemori credul popularli invest
thi old manxman with preternatur power of discern so that no
white sailor serious contradict him when he said that if ever
captain ahab should be tranquilli laid outwhich might hardli come to
pass so he mutteredthen whoever should do that last offic for the
dead would find a birthmark on him from crown to sole
so powerfulli did the whole grim aspect of ahab affect me and the
livid brand which streak it that for the first few moment i hardli
note that not a littl of thi overbear grim wa ow to the
barbar white leg upon which he partli stood it had previous come
to me that thi ivori leg had at sea been fashion from the polish
bone of the sperm whale jaw ay he wa dismast off japan said
the old gayhead indian onc but like hi dismast craft he ship
anoth mast without come home for it he ha a quiver of em
i wa struck with the singular postur he maintain upon each side of
the pequod quarter deck and pretti close to the mizen shroud there
wa an auger hole bore about half an inch or so into the plank hi
bone leg steadi in that hole on arm elev and hold by a
shroud captain ahab stood erect look straight out beyond the
ship everpitch prow there wa an infin of firmest fortitud
a determin unsurrender wil in the fix and fearless
forward dedic of that glanc not a word he spoke nor did hi
offic sai aught to him though by all their minutest gestur and
express thei plainli show the uneasi if not pain
conscious of be under a troubl masterey and not onli that
but moodi stricken ahab stood befor them with a crucifixion in hi
face in all the nameless regal overbear digniti of some mighti woe
er long from hi first visit in the air he withdrew into hi cabin
but after that morn he wa everi dai visibl to the crew either
stand in hi pivothol or seat upon an ivori stool he had or
heavili walk the deck as the sky grew less gloomi inde began to
grow a littl genial he becam still less and less a reclus as if
when the ship had sail from home noth but the dead wintri
bleak of the sea had then kept him so seclud and by and by it
came to pass that he wa almost continu in the air but as yet
for all that he said or percept did on the at last sunni deck he
seem as unnecessari there as anoth mast but the pequod wa onli
make a passag now not regularli cruis nearli all whale
prepar need supervis the mate were fulli compet to so
that there wa littl or noth out of himself to emploi or excit
ahab now and thu chase awai for that on interv the cloud that
layer upon layer were pile upon hi brow as ever all cloud choos
the loftiest peak to pile themselv upon
nevertheless er long the warm warbl persuas of the
pleasant holidai weather we came to seem gradual to charm him
from hi mood for as when the redcheek danc girl april and
mai trip home to the wintri misanthrop wood even the barest
ruggedest most thundercloven old oak will at least send forth some
few green sprout to welcom such gladheart visit so ahab did
in the end a littl respond to the play allur of that girlish
air more than onc did he put forth the faint blossom of a look
which in ani other man would have soon flower out in a smile
chapter xxix enter ahab to him stubb
some dai elaps and ic and iceberg all astern the pequod now went

world inward thei turn upon the soul especi when the still mild
hour of ev came on then memori shot her crystal as the clear ic
most form of noiseless twilight and all these subtl agenc more
and more thei wrought on ahab textur
old ag is alwai wake as if the longer link with life the less
man ha to do with aught that look like death among seacommand
the old greybeard will oftenest leav their berth to visit the
nightcloak deck it wa so with ahab onli that now of late he
seem so much to live in the open air that truli speak hi visit
were more to the cabin than from the cabin to the plank it feel
like go down into on tombh would mutter to himselffor an
old captain like me to be descend thi narrow scuttl to go to my
gravedug berth
so almost everi twentyfour hour when the watch of the night were
set and the band on deck sentinel the slumber of the band below
and when if a rope wa to be haul upon the forecastl the sailor
flung it not rude down as by dai but with some cautious dropt
it to it place for fear of disturb their slumber shipmat
when thi sort of steadi quietud would begin to prevail habitu
the silent steersman would watch the cabinscuttl and er long the
old man would emerg gripe at the iron banist to help hi
crippl wai some consider touch of human wa in him for at
time like these he usual abstain from patrol the
quarterdeck becaus to hi weari mate seek repos within six
inch of hi ivori heel such would have been the reverber crack
and din of that boni step that their dream would have been of the
crunch teeth of shark but onc the mood wa on him too deep for
common regard and as with heavi lumberlik pace he wa measur
the ship from taffrail to mainmast stubb the odd second mate came up
from below and with a certain unassur deprec humor
hint that if captain ahab wa pleas to walk the plank then no
on could sai nai but there might be some wai of muffl the nois
hint someth indistinctli and hesitatingli about a globe of tow
and the insert into it of the ivori heel ah stubb thou didst
not know ahab then

chapter xxx the pipe
when stubb had depart ahab stood for a while lean over the
bulwark and then as had been usual with him of late call a
sailor of the watch he sent him below for hi ivori stool and also
hi pipe light the pipe at the binnacl lamp and plant the stool
on the weather side of the deck he sat and smoke
in old nors time the throne of the sealov danish king were
fabric saith tradit of the tusk of the narwhal how could
on look at ahab then seat on that tripod of bone without
bethink him of the royalti it symbol for a khan of the plank
and a king of the sea and a great lord of leviathan wa ahab
some moment pass dure which the thick vapor came from hi mouth
in quick and constant puff which blew back again into hi face how
now he soliloqu at last withdraw the tube thi smoke no
longer sooth oh my pipe hard must it go with me if thy charm be
gone here have i been unconsci toil not pleasuringay and

curiou all dream arethrough all thi rage that i wa in i somehow
seem to be think to myself that after all it wa not much of an
insult that kick from ahab why think i what the row it not
a real leg onli a fals leg and there a mighti differ between
a live thump and a dead thump that what make a blow from the
hand flask fifti time more savag to bear than a blow from a cane
the live memberthat make the live insult my littl man and
think i to myself all the while mind while i wa stub my silli

play cudgellingin fact onli a whalebon that he gave menot a
base kick besid think i look at it onc why the end of itth
foot partwhat a small sort of end it is wherea if a broad foot
farmer kick me there a devilish broad insult but thi insult is
whittl down to a point onli but now come the greatest joke of the
dream flask while i wa batter awai at the pyramid a sort of
badgerhair old merman with a hump on hi back take me by the
shoulder and slew me round what ar you bout sai he slid
man but i wa frighten such a phiz but somehow next moment i wa
over the fright what am i about sai i at last and what busi

second thought i guess i wont kick you old fellow wise stubb
said he wise stubb and kept mutter it all the time a sort of
eat of hi own gum like a chimnei hag see he wasnt go to
stop sai over hi wise stubb wise stubb i thought i might as
well fall to kick the pyramid again but i had onli just lift my
foot for it when he roar out stop that kick halloa sai i
what the matter now old fellow look ye here sai he let
argu the insult captain ahab kick ye didnt he ye he did
sai iright here it wa veri good sai hehe us hi ivori
leg didnt he ye he did sai i well then sai he wise
stubb what have you to complain of didnt he kick with right good
will it wasnt a common pitch pine leg he kick with wa it no you

chapter xxxii cetolog
alreadi we ar boldli launch upon the deep but soon we shall be lost
in it unshor harborless immens er that come to pass er the
pequod weedi hull roll side by side with the barnacl hull of the
leviathan at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost
indispens to a thorough appreci understand of the more
special leviathan revel and allus of all sort which ar to
follow
it is some systemat exhibit of the whale in hi broad genera
that i would now fain put befor you yet is it no easi task the
classif of the constitu of a chao noth less is here
essai listen to what the best and latest author have laid down
no branch of zoologi is so much involv as that which is entitl
cetolog sai captain scoresbi ad 1820
it is not my intent were it in my power to enter into the inquiri
as to the true method of divid the cetacea into group and famili
utter confus exist among the historian of thi anim
sperm whale sai surgeon beal ad 1839
unfit to pursu our research in the unfathom water
impenetr veil cover our knowledg of the cetacea a field
strewn with thorn all these incomplet indic but serv to
tortur us naturalist
thu speak of the whale the great cuvier and john hunter and lesson
those light of zoologi and anatomi nevertheless though of real
knowledg there be littl yet of book there ar a plenti and so in
some small degre with cetolog or the scienc of whale mani ar
the men small and great old and new landsmen and seamen who have at
larg or in littl written of the whale run over a fewth author

the author of miriam coffin olmstead and the rev t cheever but to
what ultim gener purpos all these have written the abov
cite extract will show
of the name in thi list of whale author onli those follow owen
ever saw live whale and but on of them wa a real profession
harpoon and whaleman i mean captain scoresbi on the separ
subject of the greenland or rightwhal he is the best exist
author but scoresbi knew noth and sai noth of the great
sperm whale compar with which the greenland whale is almost unworthi
mention and here be it said that the greenland whale is an usurp
upon the throne of the sea he is not even by ani mean the largest of
the whale yet ow to the long prioriti of hi claim and the
profound ignor which till some seventi year back invest the
then fabul and utterli unknown spermwhal and which ignor to
thi present dai still reign in all but some few scientif retreat
and whaleport thi usurp ha been everi wai complet refer
to nearli all the leviathan allus in the great poet of past
dai will satisfi you that the greenland whale without on rival wa
to them the monarch of the sea but the time ha at last come for a
new proclam thi is chare cross hear ye good peopl allth
greenland whale is deposedth great sperm whale now reigneth
there ar onli two book in be which at all pretend to put the
live sperm whale befor you and at the same time in the remotest
degre succe in the attempt those book ar beal and bennett
both in their time surgeon to english southsea whaleship and both
exact and reliabl men the origin matter touch the sperm whale to
be found in their volum is necessarili small but so far as it goe
it is of excel qualiti though mostli confin to scientif
descript as yet howev the sperm whale scientif or poetic
live not complet in ani literatur far abov all other hunt
whale hi is an unwritten life
now the variou speci of whale need some sort of popular
comprehens classif if onli an easi outlin on for the
present hereaft to be fill in all it depart by subsequ
labor as no better man advanc to take thi matter in hand i
hereupon offer my own poor endeavor i promis noth complet
becaus ani human thing suppos to be complet must for that veri
reason infal be faulti i shall not pretend to a minut anatom
descript of the variou speci orin thi place at leastto much
of ani descript my object here is simpli to project the draught of
a systemat of cetolog i am the architect not the builder
but it is a ponder task no ordinari lettersort in the
postoffic is equal to it to grope down into the bottom of the sea
after them to have on hand among the unspeak foundat
rib and veri pelvi of the world thi is a fear thing what am i
that i should essai to hook the nose of thi leviathan the aw
taunt in job might well appal me will he the leviathan make a
coven with thee behold the hope of him is vain but i have swam
through librari and sail through ocean i have had to do with
whale with these visibl hand i am in earnest and i will try there
ar some preliminari to settl
first the uncertain unsettl condit of thi scienc of cetolog
is in the veri vestibul attest by the fact that in some quarter it
still remain a moot point whether a whale be a fish in hi system of
natur ad 1776 linnu declar i herebi separ the whale from
the fish but of my own knowledg i know that down to the year 1850
shark and shad alew and her against linnuss express edict
were still found divid the possess of the same sea with the
leviathan
the ground upon which linnu would fain have banish the whale from
the water he state as follow on account of their warm bilocular
heart their lung their movabl eyelid their hollow ear penem
intrantem feminam mammi lactantem and final ex lege natur jure
meritoqu i submit all thi to my friend simeon macei and charlei
coffin of nantucket both messmat of mine in a certain voyag and
thei unit in the opinion that the reason set forth were altogeth
insuffici charlei profan hint thei were humbug
be it known that waiv all argument i take the good old fashion
ground that the whale is a fish and call upon holi jonah to back me
thi fundament thing settl the next point is in what intern
respect doe the whale differ from other fish abov linnu ha given
you those item but in brief thei ar these lung and warm blood
wherea all other fish ar lungless and cold blood
next how shall we defin the whale by hi obviou extern so as
conspicu to label him for all time to come to be short then a
whale is a spout fish with a horizont tail there you have him
howev contract that definit is the result of expand
medit a walru spout much like a whale but the walru is not a
fish becaus he is amphibi but the last term of the definit is
still more cogent as coupl with the first almost ani on must have
notic that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat but a
vertic or upanddown tail wherea among spout fish the tail
though it mai be similarli shape invari assum a horizont
posit
by the abov definit of what a whale is i do by no mean exclud
from the leviathan brotherhood ani sea creatur hitherto identifi
with the whale by the best inform nantucket nor on the other
hand link with it ani fish hitherto authorit regard as
alien3 henc all the smaller spout and horizont tail fish
must be includ in thi groundplan of cetolog now then come the
grand divis of the entir whale host
3 i am awar that down to the present time the fish style
lamatin and dugong pigfish and sowfish of the coffin of
nantucket ar includ by mani naturalist among the whale but as
these pigfish ar a nosi contempt set mostli lurk in the
mouth of river and feed on wet hai and especi as thei do
not spout i deni their credenti as whale and have present
them with their passport to quit the kingdom of cetolog
first accord to magnitud i divid the whale into three primari
book subdivis into chapter and these shall comprehend them
all both small and larg

greenland whale and if you descend into the bowel of the variou

thu end book i folio and now begin book ii octavo
octavoes4 these embrac the whale of middl magnitud among
which at present mai be numberedi the grampu ii the black
fish iii the narwhal iv the thrasher v the killer
4 why thi book of whale is not denomin the quarto is veri
plain becaus while the whale of thi order though smaller than
those of the former order nevertheless retain a proportion
like to them in figur yet the bookbind quarto volum in it
diminish form doe not preserv the shape of the folio volum but
the octavo volum doe
book ii octavo chapter i grampusthough thi fish whose
loud sonor breath or rather blow ha furnish a proverb to
landsmen is so well known a denizen of the deep yet is he not
popularli class among whale but possess all the grand
distinct featur of the leviathan most naturalist have recognis
him for on he is of moder octavo size vari from fifteen to
twentyf feet in length and of correspond dimens round the
waist he swim in herd he is never regularli hunt though hi oil
is consider in quantiti and pretti good for light by some
fishermen hi approach is regard as premonitori of the advanc of the
great sperm whale
book ii octavo chapter ii black fishi give the popular
fishermen name for all these fish for gener thei ar the best
where ani name happen to be vagu or inexpress i shall sai so and
suggest anoth i do so now touch the black fish so call
becaus black is the rule among almost all whale so call him the
hyena whale if you pleas hi vorac is well known and from the
circumst that the inner angl of hi lip ar curv upward he
carri an everlast mephistophelean grin on hi face thi whale
averag some sixteen or eighteen feet in length he is found in almost
all latitud he ha a peculiar wai of show hi dorsal hook fin
in swim which look someth like a roman nose when not more
profit emploi the sperm whale hunter sometim captur the
hyena whale to keep up the suppli of cheap oil for domest
employmenta some frugal housekeep in the absenc of compani and
quit alon by themselv burn unsavori tallow instead of odor wax
though their blubber is veri thin some of these whale will yield you
upward of thirti gallon of oil
book ii octavo chapter iii narwhal that is nostril
whaleanoth instanc of a curious name whale so name i suppos
from hi peculiar horn be origin mistaken for a peak nose the
creatur is some sixteen feet in length while it horn averag five
feet though some exce ten and even attain to fifteen feet strictli
speak thi horn is but a lengthen tusk grow out from the jaw
in a line a littl depress from the horizont but it is onli found
on the sinist side which ha an ill effect give it owner
someth analog to the aspect of a clumsi lefthand man what
precis purpos thi ivori horn or lanc answer it would be hard to
sai it doe not seem to be us like the blade of the swordfish and
billfish though some sailor tell me that the narwhal emploi it for
a rake in turn over the bottom of the sea for food charlei coffin
said it wa us for an icepierc for the narwhal rise to the
surfac of the polar sea and find it sheet with ic thrust hi
horn up and so break through but you cannot prove either of these
surmis to be correct my own opinion is that howev thi onesid
horn mai realli be us by the narwhalehowev that mai beit would
certainli be veri conveni to him for a folder in read pamphlet
the narwhal i have heard call the tusk whale the horn whale
and the unicorn whale he is certainli a curiou exampl of the
unicorn to be found in almost everi kingdom of anim natur from
certain cloister old author i have gather that thi same
seaunicorn horn wa in ancient dai regard as the great antidot
against poison and as such prepar of it brought immens price
it wa also distil to a volatil salt for faint ladi the same
wai that the horn of the male deer ar manufactur into hartshorn
origin it wa in itself account an object of great curios
black letter tell me that sir martin frobish on hi return from that
voyag when queen bess did gallantli wave her jewel hand to him
from a window of greenwich palac as hi bold ship sail down the

letter on bend knee he present to her high a prodigi long
horn of the narwhal which for a long period after hung in the castl

hi oil is veri superior clear and fine but there is littl of it
and he is seldom hunt he is mostli found in the circumpolar sea
book ii octavo chapter iv killerof thi whale littl is
precis known to the nantucket and noth at all to the profess
naturalist from what i have seen of him at a distanc i should sai
that he wa about the big of a grampu he is veri savagea sort of
feege fish he sometim take the great folio whale by the lip and
hang there like a leech till the mighti brute is worri to death
the killer is never hunt i never heard what sort of oil he ha
except might be taken to the name bestow upon thi whale on the
ground of it indistinct for we ar all killer on land and on
sea bonapart and shark includ
book ii octavo chapter v thrasherthi gentleman is famou
for hi tail which he us for a ferul in thrash hi foe he
mount the folio whale back and as he swim he work hi passag by
flog him as some schoolmast get along in the world by a similar
process still less is known of the thrasher than of the killer both
ar outlaw even in the lawless sea
thu end book ii octavo and begin book iii duodecimo
duodecimoesthes includ the smaller whale i the huzza porpois
ii the algerin porpois iii the mealymouth porpois
to those who have not chanc special to studi the subject it mai
possibl seem strang that fish not commonli exceed four or five
feet should be marshal among whalesa word which in the popular
sens alwai convei an idea of huge but the creatur set down
abov as duodecimo ar infal whale by the term of my
definit of what a whale isi e a spout fish with a horizont
tail
book iii duodecimo chapter i huzza porpoisethi is the
common porpois found almost all over the globe the name is of my own
bestow for there ar more than on sort of porpois and someth
must be done to distinguish them i call them thu becaus he alwai
swim in hilari shoal which upon the broad sea keep toss
themselv to heaven like cap in a fourthofjuli crowd their

is good eat you know it mai never have occur to you that a
porpois spout inde hi spout is so small that it is not veri

and you will then see the great sperm whale himself in miniatur
book iii duodecimo chapter ii algerin porpoisea pirat
veri savag he is onli found i think in the pacif he is somewhat
larger than the huzza porpois but much of the same gener make
provok him and he will buckl to a shark i have lower for him mani
time but never yet saw him captur
book iii duodecimo chapter iii mealymouth porpois the
largest kind of porpois and onli found in the pacif so far as it
is known the onli english name by which he ha hitherto been
design is that of the fishersrightwhal porpois from the
circumst that he is chiefli found in the vicin of that folio in
shape he differ in some degre from the huzza porpois be of a
less rotund and jolli girth inde he is of quit a neat and
gentlemanlik figur he ha no fin on hi back most other porpois
have he ha a love tail and sentiment indian ey of a hazel
hue but hi mealymouth spoil all though hi entir back down to hi
side fin is of a deep sabl yet a boundari line distinct as the mark
in a ship hull call the bright waist that line streak him from
stem to stern with two separ color black abov and white below
the white compris part of hi head and the whole of hi mouth which
make him look as if he had just escap from a feloni visit to a
mealbag a most mean and meali aspect hi oil is much like that of
the common porpois
beyond the duodecimo thi system doe not proce inasmuch as the
porpois is the smallest of the whale abov you have all the
leviathan of note but there ar a rabbl of uncertain fugit
halffabul whale which as an american whaleman i know by
reput but not person i shall enumer them by their
forecastl appel for possibl such a list mai be valuabl to

the iceberg whale the quog whale the blue whale etc from iceland
dutch and old english author there might be quot other list
of uncertain whale bless with all manner of uncouth name but i
omit them as altogeth obsolet and can hardli help suspect them
for mere sound full of leviathan but signifi noth
final it wa state at the outset that thi system would not be

chapter xxxiii the specksnyd
concern the offic of the whalecraft thi seem as good a place
as ani to set down a littl domest peculiar on shipboard aris
from the exist of the harpoon class of offic a class unknown
of cours in ani other marin than the whalefleet
the larg import attach to the harpoon vocat is evinc
by the fact that origin in the old dutch fisheri two centuri
and more ago the command of a whale ship wa not wholli lodg in the
person now call the captain but wa divid between him and an
offic call the specksnyd liter thi word mean fatcutt
usag howev in time made it equival to chief harpoon in
those dai the captain author wa restrict to the navig
and gener manag of the vessel while over the whalehunt
depart and all it concern the specksnyd or chief harpoon
reign suprem in the british greenland fisheri under the corrupt
titl of specksion thi old dutch offici is still retain but
hi former digniti is sadli abridg at present he rank simpli as
senior harpoon and as such is but on of the captain more
inferior subaltern nevertheless as upon the good conduct of the
harpoon the success of a whale voyag larg depend and sinc
in the american fisheri he is not onli an import offic in the
boat but under certain circumst night watch on a whale
ground the command of the ship deck is also hi therefor the grand
polit maxim of the sea demand that he should nomin live apart
from the men befor the mast and be in some wai distinguish as their
profession superior though alwai by them familiarli regard as
their social equal
now the grand distinct drawn between offic and man at sea is
thisth first live aft the last forward henc in whaleship and
merchantmen alik the mate have their quarter with the captain and
so too in most of the american whaler the harpoon ar lodg in
the after part of the ship that is to sai thei take their meal in
the captain cabin and sleep in a place indirectli commun with
it
though the long period of a southern whale voyag by far the longest
of all voyag now or ever made by man the peculiar peril of it and
the commun of interest prevail among a compani all of whom high
or low depend for their profit not upon fix wage but upon their
common luck togeth with their common vigil intrepid and
hard work though all these thing do in some case tend to beget a
less rigor disciplin than in merchantmen gener yet never mind
how much like an old mesopotamian famili these whalemen mai in some
primit instanc live togeth for all that the punctili
extern at least of the quarterdeck ar seldom materi relax
and in no instanc done awai inde mani ar the nantucket ship in
which you will see the skipper parad hi quarterdeck with an elat
grandeur not surpass in ani militari navi nai extort almost as
much outward homag as if he wore the imperi purpl and not the
shabbiest of pilotcloth
and though of all men the moodi captain of the pequod wa the least
given to that sort of shallowest assumpt and though the onli homag
he ever exact wa implicit instantan obedi though he
requir no man to remov the shoe from hi feet er step upon the
quarterdeck and though there were time when ow to peculiar
circumst connect with event hereaft to be detail he
address them in unusu term whether of condescens or in
terrorem or otherwis yet even captain ahab wa by no mean
unobserv of the paramount form and usag of the sea
nor perhap will it fail to be eventu perceiv that behind
those form and usag as it were he sometim mask himself
incident make us of them for other and more privat end than
thei were legitim intend to subserv that certain sultan of
hi brain which had otherwis in a good degre remain unmanifest
through those form that same sultan becam incarn in an
irresist dictatorship for be a man intellectu superior what
it will it can never assum the practic avail supremaci over
other men without the aid of some sort of extern art and
entrench alwai in themselv more or less paltri and base
thi it is that for ever keep god true princ of the empir from
the world hust and leav the highest honor that thi air can
give to those men who becom famou more through their infinit
inferior to the choic hidden hand of the divin inert than
through their undoubt superior over the dead level of the mass
such larg virtu lurk in these small thing when extrem polit
superstit invest them that in some royal instanc even to idiot
imbecil thei have impart potenc but when as in the case of
nichola the czar the ring crown of geograph empir encircl an
imperi brain then the plebeian herd crouch abas befor the
tremend central nor will the tragic dramatist who would
depict mortal indomit in it fullest sweep and direct swing
ever forget a hint incident so import in hi art as the on
now allud to
but ahab my captain still move befor me in all hi nantucket
grim and shaggi and in thi episod touch emperor and
king i must not conceal that i have onli to do with a poor old
whalehunt like him and therefor all outward majest trap
and hous ar deni me oh ahab what shall be grand in thee it
must need be pluck at from the ski and dive for in the deep and
featur in the unbodi air
chapter xxxiv the cabint
it is noon and doughboi the steward thrust hi pale
loafofbread face from the cabinscuttl announc dinner to hi lord
and master who sit in the lee quarterboat ha just been take
an observ of the sun and is now mute reckon the latitud on
the smooth medallionshap tablet reserv for that daili purpos on
the upper part of hi ivori leg from hi complet inattent to the
tide you would think that moodi ahab had not heard hi menial but
present catch hold of the mizen shroud he swing himself to the
deck and in an even unexhilar voic sai dinner mr
starbuck disappear into the cabin
when the last echo of hi sultan step ha di awai and starbuck
the first emir ha everi reason to suppos that he is seat then
starbuck rous from hi quietud take a few turn along the plank
and after a grave peep into the binnacl sai with some touch of
pleasant dinner mr stubb and descend the scuttl the second
emir loung about the rig awhil and then slightli shake the
main brace to see whether it be all right with that import rope he
likewis take up the old burden and with a rapid dinner mr flask
follow after hi predecessor
but the third emir now see himself all alon on the quarterdeck
seem to feel reliev from some curiou restraint for tip all
sort of know wink in all sort of direct and kick off hi
shoe he strike into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpip right
over the grand turk head and then by a dexter sleight pitch
hi cap up into the mizentop for a shelf he goe down rollick so
far at least as he remain visibl from the deck revers all other
process by bring up the rear with music but er step into
the cabin doorwai below he paus ship a new face altogeth and
then independ hilari littl flask enter king ahab presenc
in the charact of abjectu or the slave
it is not the least among the strang thing bred by the intens
artifici of seausag that while in the open air of the deck
some offic will upon provoc bear themselv boldli and
defyingli enough toward their command yet ten to on let those
veri offic the next moment go down to their customari dinner in that
same command cabin and straightwai their inoffens not to sai
deprecatori and humbl air toward him as he sit at the head of the
tabl thi is marvel sometim most comic wherefor thi
differ a problem perhap not to have been belshazzar king of
babylon and to have been belshazzar not haughtili but courteous
therein certainli must have been some touch of mundan grandeur but he
who in the rightli regal and intellig spirit presid over hi own
privat dinnert of invit guest that man unchalleng power
and dominion of individu influenc for the time that man royalti
of state transcend belshazzar for belshazzar wa not the greatest
who ha but onc dine hi friend ha tast what it is to be csar
it is a witcheri of social czarship which there is no withstand
now if to thi consider you superadd the offici supremaci of a
shipmast then by infer you will deriv the caus of that
peculiar of sealif just mention
over hi ivoryinlaid tabl ahab presid like a mute mane sealion
on the white coral beach surround by hi warlik but still
deferenti cub in hi own proper turn each offic wait to be
serv thei were as littl children befor ahab and yet in ahab
there seem not to lurk the smallest social arrog with on mind
their intent ey all fasten upon the old man knife as he carv
the chief dish befor him i do not suppos that for the world thei
would have profan that moment with the slightest observ even
upon so neutral a topic as the weather no and when reach out hi
knife and fork between which the slice of beef wa lock ahab
therebi motion starbuck plate toward him the mate receiv hi
meat as though receiv alm and cut it tenderli and a littl
start if perchanc the knife graze against the plate and chew
it noiselessli and swallow it not without circumspect for like
the coron banquet at frankfort where the german emperor
profoundli dine with the seven imperi elector so these cabin meal
were somehow solemn meal eaten in aw silenc and yet at tabl old
ahab forbad not convers onli he himself wa dumb what a relief
it wa to choke stubb when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold
below and poor littl flask he wa the youngest son and littl boi
of thi weari famili parti hi were the shinbon of the salin beef
hi would have been the drumstick for flask to have presum to help
himself thi must have seem to him tantamount to larceni in the
first degre had he help himself at that tabl doubtless never
more would he have been abl to hold hi head up in thi honest world
nevertheless strang to sai ahab never forbad him and had flask
help himself the chanc were ahab had never so much as notic it
least of all did flask presum to help himself to butter whether he
thought the owner of the ship deni it to him on account of it
clot hi clear sunni complexion or whether he deem that on so
long a voyag in such marketless water butter wa at a premium and
therefor wa not for him a subaltern howev it wa flask ala
wa a butterless man
anoth thing flask wa the last person down at the dinner and flask
is the first man up consid for herebi flask dinner wa badli
jam in point of time starbuck and stubb both had the start of him
and yet thei also have the privileg of loung in the rear if stubb
even who is but a peg higher than flask happen to have but a small
appetit and soon show symptom of conclud hi repast then flask
must bestir himself he will not get more than three mouth that
dai for it is against holi usag for stubb to preced flask to the
deck therefor it wa that flask onc admit in privat that ever
sinc he had arisen to the digniti of an offic from that moment he
had never known what it wa to be otherwis than hungri more or less
for what he at did not so much reliev hi hunger as keep it immort
in him peac and satisfact thought flask have for ever depart
from my stomach i am an offic but how i wish i could fist a bit of
oldfashion beef in the forecastl as i us to when i wa befor
the mast there the fruit of promot now there the vaniti of
glori there the insan of life besid if it were so that ani
mere sailor of the pequod had a grudg against flask in flask
offici capac all that sailor had to do in order to obtain ampl
vengeanc wa to go aft at dinnertim and get a peep at flask
through the cabin skylight sit silli and dumfound befor
aw ahab
now ahab and hi three mate form what mai be call the first tabl
in the pequod cabin after their departur take place in invert
order to their arriv the canva cloth wa clear or rather wa
restor to some hurri order by the pallid steward and then the
three harpoon were bidden to the feast thei be it residuari
legate thei made a sort of temporari servant hall of the high and
mighti cabin
in strang contrast to the hardli toler constraint and nameless
invis domin of the captain tabl wa the entir carefre
licens and eas the almost frantic democraci of those inferior
fellow the harpoon while their master the mate seem afraid
of the sound of the hing of their own jaw the harpoon chew
their food with such a relish that there wa a report to it thei dine
like lord thei fill their belli like indian ship all dai load
with spice such portent appetit had queequeg and tashtego that
to fill out the vacanc made by the previou repast often the pale
doughboi wa fain to bring on a great baron of saltjunk seemingli
quarri out of the solid ox and if he were not live about it if he
did not go with a nimbl hopskipandjump then tashtego had an
ungentlemanli wai of acceler him by dart a fork at hi back
harpoonwis and onc daggoo seiz with a sudden humor assist
doughboi memori by snatch him up bodili and thrust hi head
into a great empti wooden trencher while tashtego knife in hand
began lai out the circl preliminari to scalp him he wa
natur a veri nervou shudder sort of littl fellow thi
breadfac steward the progeni of a bankrupt baker and a hospit
nurs and what with the stand spectacl of the black terrif ahab
and the period tumultu visit of these three savag
doughboi whole life wa on continu lipquiv commonli after
see the harpoon furnish with all thing thei demand he
would escap from their clutch into hi littl pantri adjoin and
fearfulli peep out at them through the blind of it door till all wa

it wa a sight to see queequeg seat over against tashtego oppos
hi file teeth to the indian crosswis to them daggoo seat on
the floor for a bench would have brought hi hearseplum head to the
low carlin at everi motion of hi coloss limb make the low
cabin framework to shake as when an african eleph goe passeng in
a ship but for all thi the great negro wa wonderfulli abstemi
not to sai dainti it seem hardli possibl that by such compar
small mouth he could keep up the vital diffus through so
broad baroni and superb a person but doubtless thi nobl savag
fed strong and drank deep of the abound element of air and through
hi dilat nostril snuf in the sublim life of the world not by
beef or by bread ar giant made or nourish but queequeg he had a
mortal barbar smack of the lip in eatingan ugli sound enoughso
much so that the trembl doughboi almost look to see whether ani
mark of teeth lurk in hi own lean arm and when he would hear
tashtego sing out for him to produc himself that hi bone might
be pick the simplewit steward all but shatter the crockeri
hang round him in the pantri by hi sudden fit of the palsi nor
did the whetston which the harpoon carri in their pocket for
their lanc and other weapon and with which whetston at dinner
thei would ostentati sharpen their knive that grate sound did
not at all tend to tranquil poor doughboi how could he forget
that in hi island dai queequeg for on must certainli have been
guilti of some murder convivi indiscret ala doughboi
hard fare the white waiter who wait upon cannib not a napkin

great delight the three saltsea warrior would rise and depart to
hi credul fablemong ear all their martial bone jingl
in them at everi step like moorish scimetar in scabbard
but though these barbarian dine in the cabin and nomin live
there still be anyth but sedentari in their habit thei were
scarc ever in it except at mealtim and just befor
sleepingtim when thei pass through it to their own peculiar
quarter
in thi on matter ahab seem no except to most american whale
captain who as a set rather inclin to the opinion that by right
the ship cabin belong to them and that it is by courtesi alon that
anybodi els is at ani time permit there so that in real truth
the mate and harpoon of the pequod might more properli be said to
have live out of the cabin than in it for when thei did enter it it
wa someth as a streetdoor enter a hous turn inward for a
moment onli to be turn out the next and as a perman thing
resid in the open air nor did thei lose much herebi in the cabin
wa no companionship social ahab wa inaccess though nomin
includ in the censu of christendom he wa still an alien to it he
live in the world as the last of the grisli bear live in settl
missouri and as when spring and summer had depart that wild logan
of the wood buri himself in the hollow of a tree live out the
winter there suck hi own paw so in hi inclement howl old
ag ahab soul shut up in the cave trunk of hi bodi there fed
upon the sullen paw of it gloom
chapter xxxv the masthead
it wa dure the more pleasant weather that in due rotat with the
other seamen my first masthead came round
in most american whalemen the masthead ar man almost
simultan with the vessel leav her port even though she mai
have fifteen thousand mile and more to sail er reach her proper
cruis ground and if after a three four or five year voyag she
is draw nigh home with anyth empti in hersai an empti vial
eventhen her masthead ar kept man to the last and not till her
skysailpol sail in among the spire of the port doe she altogeth
relinquish the hope of captur on whale more
now as the busi of stand masthead ashor or afloat is a
veri ancient and interest on let us in some measur expati
here i take it that the earliest stander of masthead were the old
egyptian becaus in all my research i find none prior to them
for though their progenitor the builder of babel must doubtless by
their tower have intend to rear the loftiest masthead in all asia
or africa either yet er the final truck wa put to it as that great
stone mast of their mai be said to have gone by the board in the
dread gale of god wrath therefor we cannot give these babel
builder prioriti over the egyptian and that the egyptian were a
nation of masthead stander is an assert base upon the gener
belief among archologist that the first pyramid were found for
astronom purpos a theori singularli support by the peculiar
stairlik format of all four side of those edific wherebi with
prodigi long uplift of their leg those old astronom were
wont to mount to the apex and sing out for new star even as the
lookout of a modern ship sing out for a sail or a whale just bear
in sight in saint stylit the famou christian hermit of old time
who built him a lofti stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole
latter portion of hi life on it summit hoist hi food from the
ground with a tackl in him we have a remark instanc of a
dauntless standerofmasthead who wa not to be driven from hi
place by fog or frost rain hail or sleet but valiantli face
everyth out to the last liter di at hi post of modern
standersofmasthead we have but a lifeless set mere stone iron
and bronz men who though well capabl of face out a stiff gale
ar still entir incompet to the busi of sing out upon
discov ani strang sight there is napoleon who upon the top of
the column of vendom stand with arm fold some on hundr and
fifti feet in the air careless now who rule the deck below
whether loui philipp loui blanc or loui the devil great
washington too stand high aloft on hi tower mainmast in
baltimor and like on of hercul pillar hi column mark that
point of human grandeur beyond which few mortal will go admir
nelson also on a capstan of gunmet stand hi masthead in
trafalgar squar and ever when most obscur by that london smoke
token is yet given that a hidden hero is there for where there is
smoke must be fire but neither great washington nor napoleon nor
nelson will answer a singl hail from below howev madli invok to
befriend by their counsel the distract deck upon which thei gaze
howev it mai be surmis that their spirit penetr through the
thick haze of the futur and descri what shoal and what rock must be
shun
it mai seem unwarrant to coupl in ani respect the masthead
stander of the land with those of the sea but that in truth it is not
so is plainli evinc by an item for which ob maci the sole
historian of nantucket stand account the worthi ob tell us
that in the earli time of the whale fisheri er ship were regularli
launch in pursuit of the game the peopl of that island erect
lofti spar along the seacoast to which the lookout ascend by
mean of nail cleat someth as fowl go upstair in a henhous
a few year ago thi same plan wa adopt by the bai whalemen of new
zealand who upon descri the game gave notic to the readyman
boat nigh the beach but thi custom ha now becom obsolet turn we
then to the on proper masthead that of a whaleship at sea the
three masthead ar kept man from sunris to sunset the seamen
take their regular turn as at the helm and reliev each other
everi two hour in the seren weather of the tropic it is exceedingli
pleasant the masthead nai to a dreami medit man it is
delight there you stand a hundr feet abov the silent deck
stride along the deep as if the mast were gigant stilt while
beneath you and between your leg as it were swim the hugest monster
of the sea even as ship onc sail between the boot of the famou
colossu at old rhode there you stand lost in the infinit seri of
the sea with noth ruffl but the wave the tranc ship
indol roll the drowsi trade wind blow everyth resolv you
into languor for the most part in thi tropic whale life a sublim
unev invest you you hear no new read no gazett extra
with startl account of commonplac never delud you into
unnecessari excit you hear of no domest afflict bankrupt
secur fall of stock ar never troubl with the thought of what
you shall have for dinnerfor all your meal for three year and more
ar snugli stow in cask and your bill of fare is immut
in on of those southern whalemen on a long three or four year
voyag as often happen the sum of the variou hour you spend at the
masthead would amount to sever entir month and it is much to be
deplor that the place to which you devot so consider a portion
of the whole term of your natur life should be so sadli destitut of
anyth approach to a cosi inhabit or adapt to breed a
comfort local of feel such as pertain to a bed a hammock
a hears a sentri box a pulpit a coach or ani other of those small
and snug contriv in which men temporarili isol themselv your
most usual point of perch is the head of the t gallantmast where you
stand upon two thin parallel stick almost peculiar to whalemen
call the t gallant crosstre here toss about by the sea the
beginn feel about as cosi as he would stand on a bull horn to
be sure in cold weather you mai carri your hous aloft with you in
the shape of a watchcoat but properli speak the thickest
watchcoat is no more of a hous than the unclad bodi for as the soul
is glu insid of it fleshli tabernacl and cannot freeli move about
in it nor even move out of it without run great risk of perish
like an ignor pilgrim cross the snowi alp in winter so a
watchcoat is not so much of a hous as it is a mere envelop or
addit skin encas you you cannot put a shelf or chest of
drawer in your bodi and no more can you make a conveni closet of
your watchcoat
concern all thi it is much to be deplor that the masthead of a
southern whale ship ar unprovid with those enviabl littl tent or
pulpit call crowsnest in which the lookout of a greenland
whaler ar protect from the inclement weather of the frozen sea in
the firesid narr of captain sleet entitl a voyag among the
iceberg in quest of the greenland whale and incident for the
rediscoveri of the lost iceland coloni of old greenland in thi
admir volum all stander of masthead ar furnish with a
charmingli circumstanti account of the then recent invent
crowsnest of the glacier which wa the name of captain sleet
good craft he call it the sleet crowsnest in honor of
himself he be the origin inventor and patente and free from all
ridicul fals delicaci and hold that if we call our own children
after our own name we father be the origin inventor and
patente so likewis should we denomin after ourselv ani other
apparatu we mai beget in shape the sleet crowsnest is someth
like a larg tierc or pipe it is open abov howev where it is
furnish with a movabl sidescreen to keep to windward of your head
in a hard gale be fix on the summit of the mast you ascend into
it through a littl traphatch in the bottom on the after side or
side next the stern of the ship is a comfort seat with a locker
underneath for umbrella comfort and coat in front is a leather
rack in which to keep your speak trumpet pipe telescop and
other nautic conveni when captain sleet in person stood hi
masthead in thi crow nest of hi he tell us that he alwai had a
rifl with him also fix in the rack togeth with a powder flask
and shot for the purpos of pop off the strai narwhal or
vagrant sea unicorn infest those water for you cannot
successfulli shoot at them from the deck ow to the resist of the
water but to shoot down upon them is a veri differ thing now it
wa plainli a labor of love for captain sleet to describ as he doe
all the littl detail conveni of hi crowsnest but though he
so enlarg upon mani of these and though he treat us to a veri
scientif account of hi experi in thi crowsnest with a small
compass he kept there for the purpos of counteract the error
result from what is call the local attract of all binnacl
magnet an error ascrib to the horizont vicin of the iron in
the ship plank and in the glacier case perhap to there have
been so mani brokendown blacksmith among her crew i sai that though
the captain is veri discreet and scientif here yet for all hi
learn binnacl deviat azimuth compass observ and
approxim error he know veri well captain sleet that he wa
not so much immers in those profound magnet medit as to fail
be attract occasion toward that well replenish littl
casebottl so nice tuck in on on side of hi crow nest within
easi reach of hi hand though upon the whole i greatli admir and
even love the brave the honest and learn captain yet i take it
veri ill of him that he should so utterli ignor that casebottl
see what a faith friend and comfort it must have been while
with mitten finger and hood head he wa studi the mathemat
aloft there in that bird nest within three or four perch of the
pole
but if we southern whalefish ar not so snugli hous aloft as
captain sleet and hi greenlandmen were yet that disadvantag is
greatli counterbalanc by the wide contrast seren of those
seduct sea in which we south fisher mostli float for on i us
to loung up the rig veri leisur rest in the top to have a
chat with queequeg or ani on els off duti whom i might find there
then ascend a littl wai further and throw a lazi leg over the

my oath had been weld with their and stronger i shout and more
did i hammer and clinch my oath becaus of the dread in my soul a
wild mystic sympathet feel wa in me ahab quenchless feud
seem mine with greedi ear i learn the histori of that murder
monster against whom i and all the other had taken our oath of
violenc and reveng
for some time past though at interv onli the unaccompani
seclud white whale had haunt those uncivil sea mostli
frequent by the sperm whale fishermen but not all of them knew of
hi exist onli a few of them compar had knowingli seen
him while the number who as yet had actual and knowingli given
battl to him wa small inde for ow to the larg number of
whalecruis the disorderli wai thei were sprinkl over the entir
wateri circumfer mani of them adventur push their quest
along solitari latitud so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth
or more on a stretch to encount a singl newstel sail of ani
sort the inordin length of each separ voyag the irregular
of the time of sail from home all these with other circumst
direct and indirect long obstruct the spread through the whole
worldwid whalingfleet of the special individu tide
concern mobi dick it wa hardli to be doubt that sever vessel
report to have encount at such or such a time or on such or
such a meridian a sperm whale of uncommon magnitud and malign
which whale after do great mischief to hi assail had
complet escap them to some mind it wa not an unfair
presumpt i sai that the whale in question must have been no other
than mobi dick yet as of late the sperm whale fisheri had been mark
by variou and not unfrequ instanc of great feroc cun and
malic in the monster attack therefor it wa that those who by
accid ignorantli gave battl to mobi dick such hunter perhap
for the most part were content to ascrib the peculiar terror he bred
more as it were to the peril of the sperm whale fisheri at larg
than to the individu caus in that wai mostli the disastr
encount between ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularli
regard
and as for those who previous hear of the white whale by chanc
caught sight of him in the begin of the thing thei had everi on
of them almost as boldli and fearlessli lower for him as for ani
other whale of that speci but at length such calam did ensu
in these assaultsnot restrict to sprain wrist and ancl broken
limb or devour amputationsbut fatal to the last degre of
fatal those repeat disastr repuls all accumul and
pile their terror upon mobi dick those thing had gone far to shake
the fortitud of mani brave hunter to whom the stori of the white
whale had eventu come
nor did wild rumor of all sort fail to exagger and still the more
horrifi the true histori of these deadli encount for not onli do
fabul rumor natur grow out of the veri bodi of all surpris
terribl eventsa the smitten tree give birth to it fungi but in
maritim life far more than in that of terra firma wild rumor
abound wherev there is ani adequ realiti for them to cling to
and as the sea surpass the land in thi matter so the whale fisheri
surpass everi other sort of maritim life in the wonder and
fear of the rumor which sometim circul there for not onli
ar whalemen as a bodi unexempt from that ignor and
superstiti hereditari to all sailor but of all sailor thei
ar by all odd the most directli brought into contact with whatev is
appallingli astonish in the sea face to face thei not onli ey it
greatest marvel but hand to jaw give battl to them alon in such
remotest water that though you sail a thousand mile and pass a
thousand shore you would not come to ani chisel hearthston or
aught hospit beneath that part of the sun in such latitud and
longitud pursu too such a call as he doe the whaleman is
wrap by influenc all tend to make hi fanci pregnant with mani
a mighti birth
no wonder then that ever gather volum from the mere transit over
the widest wateri space the outblown rumor of the white whale did in
the end incorpor with themselv all manner of morbid hint and
halfform ftal suggest of supernatur agenc which
eventu invest mobi dick with new terror unborrow from anyth
that visibl appear so that in mani case such a panic did he final
strike that few who by those rumor at least had heard of the white
whale few of those hunter were will to encount the peril of hi
jaw
but there were still other and more vital practic influenc at work
not even at the present dai ha the origin prestig of the sperm
whale as fearfulli distinguish from all other speci of the
leviathan di out of the mind of the whalemen as a bodi there ar
those thi dai among them who though intellig and courag
enough in offer battl to the greenland or right whale would
perhapseith from profession inexperi or incompet or
timid declin a contest with the sperm whale at ani rate there
ar plenti of whalemen especi among those whale nation not
sail under the american flag who have never hostil encount
the sperm whale but whose sole knowledg of the leviathan is
restrict to the ignobl monster primit pursu in the north
seat on their hatch these men will hearken with a childish
firesid interest and aw to the wild strang tale of southern
whale nor is the preemin tremend of the great sperm whale
anywher more feelingli comprehend than on board of those prow
which stem him
and as if the now test realiti of hi might had in former legendari
time thrown it shadow befor it we find some book
naturalistsolassen and povelsondeclar the sperm whale not onli to
be a constern to everi other creatur in the sea but also to be
so incred feroci as continu to be athirst for human blood
nor even down to so late a time as cuvier were these or almost
similar impress effac for in hi natur histori the baron
himself affirm that at sight of the sperm whale all fish shark
includ ar struck with the most live terror and often in the
precipit of their flight dash themselv against the rock with
such violenc as to caus instantan death and howev the gener
experi in the fisheri mai amend such report as these yet in
their full terribl even to the bloodthirsti item of povelson the
superstiti belief in them is in some vicissitud of their
vocat reviv in the mind of the hunter
so that overaw by the rumor and portent concern him not a few
of the fishermen recal in refer to mobi dick the earlier dai
of the sperm whale fisheri when it wa oftentim hard to induc long
practis right whalemen to embark in the peril of thi new and dare
warfar such men protest that although other leviathan might be
hopefulli pursu yet to chase and point lanc at such an apparit
as the sperm whale wa not for mortal man that to attempt it would be
inevit to be torn into a quick etern on thi head there ar
some remark document that mai be consult
nevertheless some there were who even in the face of these thing
were readi to give chase to mobi dick and a still greater number who
chanc onli to hear of him distantli and vagu without the
specif detail of ani certain calam and without superstiti
accompani were suffici hardi not to flee from the battl if
offer
on of the wild suggest refer to as at last come to be link
with the white whale in the mind of the superstiti inclin wa
the unearthli conceit that mobi dick wa ubiquit that he had
actual been encount in opposit latitud at on and the same
instant of time
nor credul as such mind must have been wa thi conceit
altogeth without some faint show of superstiti probabl for as
the secret of the current in the sea have never yet been divulg
even to the most erudit research so the hidden wai of the sperm
whale when beneath the surfac remain in great part unaccount to
hi pursuer and from time to time have origin the most curiou
and contradictori specul regard them especi concern
the mystic mode wherebi after sound to a great depth he
transport himself with such vast swift to the most wide distant
point
it is a thing well known to both american and english whaleship and
as well a thing place upon authorit record year ago by scoresbi
that some whale have been captur far north in the pacif in whose
bodi have been found the barb of harpoon dart in the greenland
sea nor is it to be gainsaid that in some of these instanc it ha
been declar that the interv of time between the two assault could
not have exceed veri mani dai henc by infer it ha been
believ by some whalemen that the nor west passag so long a
problem to man wa never a problem to the whale so that here in the
real live experi of live men the prodigi relat in old
time of the inland strello mountain in portug near whose top there
wa said to be a lake in which the wreck of ship float up to the
surfac and that still more wonder stori of the arethusa fountain
near syracus whose water were believ to have come from the holi
land by an underground passag these fabul narrat ar almost
fulli equal by the realiti of the whaleman
forc into familiar then with such prodigi as these and
know that after repeat intrepid assault the white whale had
escap aliv it cannot be much matter of surpris that some whalemen
should go still further in their superstit declar mobi dick not
onli ubiquit but immort for immort is but ubiqu in
time that though grove of spear should be plant in hi flank he
would still swim awai unharm or if inde he should ever be made to
spout thick blood such a sight would be but a ghastli decept for
again in unensanguin billow hundr of leagu awai hi unsulli
jet would onc more be seen
but even strip of these supernatur surmis there wa enough in
the earthli make and incontest charact of the monster to strike
the imagin with unwont power for it wa not so much hi
uncommon bulk that so much distinguish him from other sperm whale
but as wa elsewher thrown outa peculiar snowwhit wrinkl
forehead and a high pyramid white hump these were hi promin
featur the token wherebi even in the limitless unchart sea he
reveal hi ident at a long distanc to those who knew him
the rest of hi bodi wa so streak and spot and marbl with the
same shroud hue that in the end he had gain hi distinct
appel of the white whale a name inde liter justifi by
hi vivid aspect when seen glide at high noon through a dark blue
sea leav a milkywai wake of creami foam all spangl with golden
gleam
nor wa it hi unwont magnitud nor hi remark hue nor yet hi
deform lower jaw that so much invest the whale with natur
terror as that unexampl intellig malign which accord to
specif account he had over and over again evinc in hi assault
more than all hi treacher retreat struck more of dismai than
perhap aught els for when swim befor hi exult pursuer
with everi appar symptom of alarm he had sever time been known
to turn around suddenli and bear down upon them either stave
their boat to splinter or drive them back in constern to their
ship
alreadi sever fatal had attend hi chase but though similar
disast howev littl bruit ashor were by no mean unusu in
the fisheri yet in most instanc such seem the white whale
infern aforethought of feroc that everi dismemb or death
that he caus wa not wholli regard as have been inflict by an
unintellig agent
judg then to what pitch of inflam distract furi the mind of
hi more desper hunter were impel when amid the chip of chew
boat and the sink limb of torn comrad thei swam out of the
white curd of the whale dire wrath into the seren exasper
sunlight that smile on as if at a birth or a bridal
hi three boat stove around him and oar and men both whirl in the
eddi on captain seiz the lineknif from hi broken prow had
dash at the whale as an arkansa duellist at hi foe blindli
seek with a six inch blade to reach the fathomdeep life of the
whale that captain wa ahab and then it wa that suddenli sweep
hi sickleshap lower jaw beneath him mobi dick had reap awai
ahab leg as a mower a blade of grass in the field no turban turk
no hire venetian or malai could have smote him with more seem
malic small reason wa there to doubt then that ever sinc that
almost fatal encount ahab had cherish a wild vindict
against the whale all the more fell for that in hi frantic morbid
he at last came to identifi with him not onli all hi bodili woe but
all hi intellectu and spiritu exasper the white whale swam
befor him as the monomaniac incarn of all those malici
agenc which some deep men feel eat in them till thei ar left
live on with half a heart and half a lung that intang malign
which ha been from the begin to whose dominion even the modern
christian ascrib onehalf of the world which the ancient ophit of
the east reverenc in their statu devilahab did not fall down and
worship it like them but deliri transfer it idea to the
abhor white whale he pit himself all mutil against it all
that most madden and torment all that stir up the lee of thing
all truth with malic in it all that crack the sinew and cake the
brain all the subtl demon of life and thought all evil to crazi
ahab were visibl personifi and made practic assail in mobi
dick he pile upon the whale white hump the sum of all the gener
rage and hate felt by hi whole race from adam down and then as if
hi chest had been a mortar he burst hi hot heart shell upon it
it is not probabl that thi monomania in him took it instant rise at
the precis time of hi bodili dismember then in dart at the
monster knife in hand he had but given loos to a sudden passion
corpor animos and when he receiv the stroke that tore him he
probabl but felt the agon bodili lacer but noth more
yet when by thi collis forc to turn toward home and for long
month of dai and week ahab and anguish lai stretch togeth in
on hammock round in mid winter that dreari howl patagonian
cape then it wa that hi torn bodi and gash soul bled into on
anoth and so interfus made him mad that it wa onli then on
the homeward voyag after the encount that the final monomania
seiz him seem all but certain from the fact that at interv
dure the passag he wa a rave lunat and though unlimb of a
leg yet such vital strength yet lurk in hi egyptian chest and wa
moreov intensifi by hi delirium that hi mate were forc to
lace him fast even there as he sail rave in hi hammock in a
straitjacket he swung to the mad rock of the gale and when
run into more suffer latitud the ship with mild stunsail
spread float across the tranquil tropic and to all appear
the old man delirium seem left behind him with the cape horn
swell and he came forth from hi dark den into the bless light and
air even then when he bore that firm collect front howev pale
and issu hi calm order onc again and hi mate thank god the
dire mad wa now gone even then ahab in hi hidden self
rave on human mad is oftentim a cun and most felin thing
when you think it fled it mai have but becom transfigur into some

that when with ivori leg he step ashor at last no nantucket

the report of hi undeni delirium at sea wa likewis popularli

alwai afterward to the veri dai of sail in the pequod on the

that far from distrust hi fit for anoth whale voyag on

that with the mad secret of hi unab rage bolt up and kei in

though in mani natur object white refiningli enhanc beauti

utterli unknown to men ashor never but some time after i learn
that gonei wa some seaman name for albatross so that by no
possibl could coleridg wild rhyme have had aught to do with
those mystic impress which were mine when i saw that bird upon
our deck for neither had i then read the rhyme nor knew the bird to
be an albatross yet in sai thi i do but indirectli burnish a
littl brighter the nobl merit of the poem and the poet
i assert then that in the wondrou bodili white of the bird
chiefli lurk the secret of the spell a truth the more evinc in
thi that by a solec of term there ar bird call grei
albatross and these i have frequent seen but never with such
emot as when i beheld the antarct fowl
but how had the mystic thing been caught whisper it not and i
will tell with a treacher hook and line as the fowl float on
the sea at last the captain made a postman of it ty a
letter leathern talli round it neck with the ship time and
place and then let it escap but i doubt not that leathern
talli meant for man wa taken off in heaven when the white fowl
flew to join the wingfold the invok and ador cherubim
most famou in our western annal and indian tradit is that of the
white steed of the prairi a magnific milkwhit charger
largeei smallhead bluffchest and with the digniti of a
thousand monarch in hi lofti overscorn carriag he wa the
elect xerx of vast herd of wild hors whose pastur in those
dai were onli fenc by the rocki mountain and the alleghani at
their flame head he westward troop it like that chosen star which
everi even lead on the host of light the flash cascad of hi
mane the curv comet of hi tail invest him with hous more
resplend than gold and silverbeat could have furnish him a
most imperi and archangel apparit of that unfallen western
world which to the ey of the old trapper and hunter reviv the
glori of those primev time when adam walk majest as a god
bluffbow and fearless as thi mighti steed whether march amid
hi aid and marshal in the van of countless cohort that endlessli
stream it over the plain like an ohio or whether with hi
circumambi subject brows all around at the horizon the white
steed gallopingli review them with warm nostril redden through
hi cool milki in whatev aspect he present himself alwai to
the bravest indian he wa the object of trembl rever and aw
nor can it be question from what stand on legendari record of thi
nobl hors that it wa hi spiritu white chiefli which so
cloth him with divin and that thi divin had that in it
which though command worship at the same time enforc a certain
nameless terror
but there ar other instanc where thi white lose all that
accessori and strang glori which invest it in the white steed and
albatross
what is it that in the albino man so peculiarli repel and often shock
the ey as that sometim he is loath by hi own kith and kin it is
that white which invest him a thing express by the name he
bear the albino is as well made as other menha no substant
deformityand yet thi mere aspect of allpervad white make him
more strang hideou than the ugliest abort why should thi be
so
nor in quit other aspect doe natur in her least palpabl but not
the less malici agenc fail to enlist among her forc thi
crown attribut of the terribl from it snowi aspect the
gauntlet ghost of the southern sea ha been denomin the white
squall nor in some histor instanc ha the art of human malic
omit so potent an auxiliari how wildli it heighten the effect of
that passag in froissart when mask in the snowi symbol of their
faction the desper white hood of ghent murder their bailiff in the
marketplac
nor in some thing doe the common hereditari experi of all
mankind fail to bear wit to the supernatur of thi hue it
cannot well be doubt that the on visibl qualiti in the aspect of
the dead which most appal the gazer is the marbl pallor linger
there as if inde that pallor were as much like the badg of
constern in the other world as of mortal trepid here and
from that pallor of the dead we borrow the express hue of the
shroud in which we wrap them nor even in our superstit do we fail
to throw the same snowi mantl round our phantom all ghost rise in
a milkwhit fogyea while these terror seiz us let us add that
even the king of terror when personifi by the evangelist ride on
hi pallid hors
therefor in hi other mood symbol whatev grand or graciou
thing he will by white no man can deni that in it profoundest
ideal signific it call up a peculiar apparit to the soul
but though without dissent thi point be fix how is mortal man to
account for it to analys it would seem imposs can we then by
the citat of some of those instanc wherein thi thing of
whitenessthough for the time either wholli or in great part strip
of all direct associ calcul to impart to it aught fear
but nevertheless is found to exert over us the same sorceri howev
modifiedcan we thu hope to light upon some chanc clue to conduct us
to the hidden caus we seek
let us try but in a matter like thi subtleti appeal to subtleti
and without imagin no man can follow anoth into these hall and
though doubtless some at least of the imagin impress about
to be present mai have been share by most men yet few perhap were
entir consciou of them at the time and therefor mai not be abl
to recal them now
why to the man of untutor ideal who happen to be but loos
acquaint with the peculiar charact of the dai doe the bare
mention of whitsuntid marshal in the fanci such long dreari
speechless process of slowpac pilgrim downcast and hood
with newfallen snow or to the unread unsophist protest of
the middl american state why doe the pass mention of a white
friar or a white nun evok such an eyeless statu in the soul
or what is there apart from the tradit of dungeon warrior and
king which will not wholli account for it that make the white tower
of london tell so much more strongli on the imagin of an
untravel american than those other stori structur it
neighborsth byward tower or even the bloodi and those sublim
tower the white mountain of new hampshir whenc in peculiar
mood come that gigant ghostli over the soul at the bare
mention of that name while the thought of virginia blue ridg is
full of a soft dewi distant dreami or why irrespect of all
latitud and longitud doe the name of the white sea exert such a
spectral over the fanci while that of the yellow sea lull us with
mortal thought of long lacquer mild afternoon on the wave
follow by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunset or to choos a
wholli unsubstanti instanc pure address to the fanci why in
read the old fairi tale of central europ doe the tall pale man
of the hartz forest whose changeless pallor unrestingli glide
through the green of the groveswhi is thi phantom more terribl than
all the whoop imp of the blocksburg
nor is it altogeth the remembr of her cathedraltoppl
earthquak nor the stampedo of her frantic sea nor the
tearless of arid ski that never rain nor the sight of her wide
field of lean spire wrench copeston and cross all adroop
like cant yard of anchor fleet and her suburban avenu of
housewal ly over upon each other as a toss pack of cardsit
is not these thing alon which make tearless lima the strangest
saddest citi thou canst see for lima ha taken the white veil and
there is a higher horror in thi white of her woe old as pizarro
thi white keep her ruin for ever new admit not the cheer
green of complet decai spread over her broken rampart the rigid
pallor of an apoplexi that fix it own distort
i know that to the common apprehens thi phenomenon of white
is not confess to be the prime agent in exagger the terror of
object otherwis terribl nor to the unimagin mind is there
aught of terror in those appear whose aw to anoth mind
almost sole consist in thi on phenomenon especi when
exhibit under ani form at all approach to mute or
univers what i mean by these two statement mai perhap be
respect elucid by the follow exampl
first the marin when draw nigh the coast of foreign land if
by night he hear the roar of breaker start to vigil and feel
just enough of trepid to sharpen all hi faculti but under
precis similar circumst let him be call from hi hammock to
view hi ship sail through a midnight sea of milki whitenessa if
from encircl headland shoal of comb white bear were swim
round him then he feel a silent superstiti dread the shroud
phantom of the whiten water is horribl to him as a real ghost in
vain the lead assur him he is still off sound heart and helm
thei both go down he never rest till blue water is under him again
yet where is the marin who will tell thee sir it wa not so much
the fear of strike hidden rock as the fear of that hideou
white that so stir me
second to the nativ indian of peru the continu sight of the
snowhowdah and convei naught of dread except perhap in the
mere fanci of the etern frost desol reign at such vast
altitud and the natur conceit of what a fear it would be to
lose oneself in such inhuman solitud much the same is it with the
backwoodsman of the west who with compar indiffer view an
unbound prairi sheet with driven snow no shadow of tree or twig
to break the fix tranc of white not so the sailor behold
the sceneri of the antarct sea where at time by some infern
trick of legerdemain in the power of frost and air he shiver and
half shipwreck instead of rainbow speak hope and solac to hi
miseri view what seem a boundless churchyard grin upon him with
it lean ic monument and splinter cross
but thou sayest methink thi whitelead chapter about white is
but a white flag hung out from a craven soul thou surrenderest to a
hypo ishmael
tell me why thi strong young colt foal in some peac vallei of
vermont far remov from all beast of preywhi is it that upon the
sunniest dai if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him so that
he cannot even see it but onli smell it wild anim muskinesswhi
will he start snort and with burst ey paw the ground in
phrensi of affright there is no remembr in him of ani gore of
wild creatur in hi green northern home so that the strang
muski he smell cannot recal to him anyth associ with the
experi of former peril for what know he thi new england colt
of the black bison of distant oregon
no but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute the instinct of the
knowledg of the demon in the world though thousand of mile from
oregon still when he smell that savag musk the rend gore
bison herd ar as present as to the desert wild foal of the
prairi which thi instant thei mai be trampl into dust
thu then the muffl roll of a milki sea the bleak rustl of
the festoon frost of mountain the desol shift of the
windrow snow of prairi all these to ishmael ar as the shake
of that buffalo robe to the frighten colt
though neither know where lie the nameless thing of which the mystic
sign give forth such hint yet with me as with the colt somewher
those thing must exist though in mani of it aspect thi visibl
world seem form in love the invis sphere were form in
fright
but not yet have we solv the incant of thi white and
learn why it appeal with such power to the soul and more strang
and far more portentouswhi as we have seen it is at onc the most
mean symbol of spiritu thing nai the veri veil of the
christian deiti and yet should be as it is the intensifi agent
in thing the most appal to mankind
is it that by it indefinit it shadow forth the heartless void
and immens of the univers and thu stab us from behind with the
thought of annihil when behold the white depth of the milki
wai or is it that as in essenc white is not so much a color as
the visibl absenc of color and at the same time the concret of all
color is it for these reason that there is such a dumb blank
full of mean in a wide landscap of snowsa colorless allcolor of
atheism from which we shrink and when we consid that other theori of
the natur philosoph that all other earthli hueseveri state or
love emblazoningth sweet ting of sunset ski and wood yea and
the gild velvet of butterfli and the butterfli cheek of young
girl all these ar but subtil deceit not actual inher in
substanc but onli laid on from without so that all deifi natur
absolut paint like the harlot whose allur cover noth but
the charnelhous within and when we proce further and consid
that the mystic cosmet which produc everi on of her hue the
great principl of light for ever remain white or colorless in
itself and if oper without medium upon matter would touch all
object even tulip and rose with it own blank tingepond all
thi the palsi univers li befor us a leper and like wil
travel in lapland who refus to wear color and color glass
upon their ey so the wretch infidel gaze himself blind at the

all these thing the albino whale wa the symbol wonder ye then at the

chapter xliv the chart
had you follow captain ahab down into hi cabin after the squall that
took place on the night succeed that wild ratif of hi
purpos with hi crew you would have seen him go to a locker in the
transom and bring out a larg wrinkl roll of yellowish sea
chart spread them befor him on hi screweddown tabl then seat
himself befor it you would have seen him intent studi the variou
line and shade which there met hi ey and with slow but steadi
pencil trace addit cours over space that befor were blank at
interv he would refer to pile of old logbook besid him wherein
were set down the season and place in which on variou former
voyag of variou ship sperm whale had been captur or seen
while thu emploi the heavi pewter lamp suspend in chain over hi
head continu rock with the motion of the ship and for ever
threw shift gleam and shadow of line upon hi wrinkl brow till
it almost seem that while he himself wa mark out line and
cours on the wrinkl chart some invis pencil wa also trace
line and cours upon the deepli mark chart of hi forehead
but it wa not thi night in particular that in the solitud of hi
cabin ahab thu ponder over hi chart almost everi night thei were
brought out almost everi night some pencil mark were effac and
other were substitut for with the chart of all four ocean befor
him ahab wa thread a maze of current and eddi with a view to
the more certain accomplish of that monomaniac thought of hi soul
now to ani on not fulli acquaint with the wai of the leviathan
it might seem an absurdli hopeless task thu to seek out on solitari
creatur in the unhoop ocean of thi planet but not so did it seem
to ahab who knew the set of all tide and current and therebi
calcul the drift of the sperm whale food and also call
to mind the regular ascertain season for hunt him in particular
latitud could arriv at reason surmis almost approach to
certainti concern the timeliest dai to be upon thi or that
ground in search of hi prei
so assur inde is the fact concern the periodic of the
sperm whale resort to given water that mani hunter believ
that could he be close observ and studi throughout the world
were the log for on voyag of the entir whale fleet carefulli
collat then the migrat of the sperm whale would be found to
correspond in invari to those of the herringsho or the
flight of swallow on thi hint attempt have been made to construct
elabor migratori chart of the sperm whale7
7 sinc the abov wa written the statement is happili born out by
an offici circular issu by lieuten mauri of the nation
observatori washington april 16th 1851 by that circular it
appear that precis such a chart is in cours of complet and
portion of it ar present in the circular thi chart divid the
ocean into district of five degre of latitud by five degre of
longitud perpendicularli through each of which district ar twelv
column for the twelv month and horizont through each of which
district ar three line on to show the number of dai that have
been spent in each month in everi district and the two other to show
the number of dai in which whale sperm or right have been seen
besid when make a passag from on feedingground to anoth the
sperm whale guid by some infal instinctsai rather secret
intellig from the deitymostli swim in vein as thei ar call
continu their wai along a given oceanlin with such undevi
exactitud that no ship ever sail her cours by ani chart with on
tith of such marvel precis though in these case the
direct taken by ani on whale be straight as a surveyor parallel
and though the line of advanc be strictli confin to it own
unavoid straight wake yet the arbitrari vein in which at these
time he is said to swim gener embrac some few mile in width
more or less as the vein is presum to expand or contract but
never exce the visual sweep from the whaleship masthead when
circumspectli glide along thi magic zone the sum is that at
particular season within that breadth and along that path migrat
whale mai with great confid be look for
and henc not onli at substanti time upon well known separ
feedingground could ahab hope to encount hi prei but in cross
the widest expans of water between those ground he could by hi
art so place and time himself on hi wai as even then not to be
wholli without prospect of a meet
there wa a circumst which at first sight seem to entangl hi
deliri but still method scheme but not so in the realiti
perhap though the gregari sperm whale have their regular season
for particular ground yet in gener you cannot conclud that the
herd which hunt such and such a latitud or longitud thi year
sai will turn out to be ident the same with those that were
found there the preced season though there ar peculiar and
unquestion instanc where the contrari of thi ha prove true in
gener the same remark onli within a less wide limit appli to the
solitari and hermit among the matur ag sperm whale so that
though mobi dick had in a former year been seen for exampl on what
is call the seychel ground in the indian ocean or volcano bai on
the japanes coast yet it did not follow that were the pequod to
visit either of those spot at ani subsequ correspond season she
would infal encount him there so too with some other feed
ground where he had at time reveal himself but all these seem
onli hi casual stoppingplac and oceaninn so to speak not hi
place of prolong abod and where ahab chanc of accomplish
hi object have hitherto been spoken of allus ha onli been made to
whatev waysid anteced extra prospect were hi er a
particular set time or place were attain when all possibl
would becom probabl and as ahab fondli thought everi
possibl the next thing to a certainti that particular set time and
place were conjoin in the on technic phraseth
seasononthelin for there and then for sever consecut year
mobi dick had been period descri linger in those water for
awhil as the sun in it annual round loiter for a predict
interv in ani on sign of the zodiac there it wa too that most of
the deadli encount with the white whale had taken place there the
wave were stori with hi deed there also wa that tragic spot
where the monomaniac old man had found the aw motiv to hi
vengeanc but in the cautiou comprehens and unloit
vigil with which ahab threw hi brood soul into thi unfalt
hunt he would not permit himself to rest all hi hope upon the on
crown fact abov mention howev flatter it might be to those
hope nor in the sleepless of hi vow could he so tranquil hi
unquiet heart as to postpon all interven quest
now the pequod had sail from nantucket at the veri begin of the
seasononthelin no possibl endeavor then could enabl her
command to make the great passag southward doubl cape horn and
then run down sixti degre of latitud arriv in the equatori
pacif in time to cruis there therefor he must wait for the next
ensu season yet the prematur hour of the pequod sail had
perhap been correctli select by ahab with a view to thi veri
complexion of thing becaus an interv of three hundr and
sixtyf dai and night wa befor him an interv which instead
of impati endur ashor he would spend in a miscellan hunt
if by chanc the white whale spend hi vacat in sea far remot
from hi period feedingground should turn up hi wrinkl brow
off the persian gulf or in the bengal bai or china sea or in ani
other water haunt by hi race so that monsoon pampa
norwest harmattan trade ani wind but the levant and simoom
might blow mobi dick into the deviou zigzag worldcircl of the
pequod circumnavig wake
but grant all thi yet regard discreetli and coolli seem it
not but a mad idea thi that in the broad boundless ocean on
solitari whale even if encount should be thought capabl of
individu recognit from hi hunter even as a whitebeard mufti
in the throng thoroughfar of constantinopl ye for the peculiar
snowwhit brow of mobi dick and hi snowwhit hump could not but be
unmistak and have i not talli the whale ahab would mutter to
himself as after pore over hi chart till long after midnight he
would throw himself back in reveriest him and shall he escap
hi broad fin ar bore and scallop out like a lost sheep ear
and here hi mad mind would run on in a breathless race till a
weari and faint of ponder came over him and in the open air
of the deck he would seek to recov hi strength ah god what
tranc of torment doe that man endur who is consum with on
unachiev reveng desir he sleep with clench hand and wake
with hi own bloodi nail in hi palm
often when forc from hi hammock by exhaust and intoler vivid

round and round in hi blaze brain till the veri throb of hi

and a chasm seem open in him from which fork flame and
lightn shot up and accurs fiend beckon him to leap down among
them when thi hell in himself yawn beneath him a wild cry would be
heard through the ship and with glare ey ahab would burst from hi
state room as though escap from a bed that wa on fire yet these
perhap instead of be the unsuppress symptom of some latent
weak or fright at hi own resolv were but the plainest token of
it intens for at such time crazi ahab the scheme
unappeasedli steadfast hunter of the white whale thi ahab that had
gone to hi hammock wa not the agent that so caus him to burst from
it in horror again the latter wa the etern live principl or
soul in him and in sleep be for the time dissoci from the
character mind which at other time emploi it for it outer
vehicl or agent it spontan sought escap from the scorch
contigu of the frantic thing of which for the time it wa no

chapter xlv the affidavit
so far as what there mai be of a narr in thi book and inde
as indirectli touch on or two veri interest and curiou
particular in the habit of sperm whale the forego chapter in
it earliest part is as import a on as will be found in thi
volum but the lead matter of it requir to be still further and
more familiarli enlarg upon in order to be adequ understood
and moreov to take awai ani incredul which a profound ignor of
the entir subject mai induc in some mind as to the natur veriti
of the main point of thi affair
i care not to perform thi part of my task method but shall be
content to produc the desir impress by separ citat of
item practic or reliabl known to me as a whaleman and from
these citat i take itth conclus aim at will natur
follow of itself
first i have person known three instanc where a whale after
receiv a harpoon ha effect a complet escap and after an
interv in on instanc of three year ha been again struck by the
same hand and slain when the two iron both mark by the same
privat cypher have been taken from the bodi in the instanc where
three year interven between the fling of the two harpoon and i
think it mai have been someth more than that the man who dart
them happen in the interv to go in a trade ship on a voyag to
africa went ashor there join a discoveri parti and penetr far
into the interior where he travel for a period of nearli two year
often endang by serpent savag tiger poison miasma with
all the other common peril incid to wander in the heart of
unknown region meanwhil the whale he had struck must also have been
on it travel no doubt it had thrice circumnavig the globe
brush with it flank all the coast of africa but to no purpos
thi man and thi whale again came togeth and the on vanquish the
other i sai i myself have known three instanc similar to thi
that is in two of them i saw the whale struck and upon the second
attack saw the two iron with the respect mark cut in them
afterward taken from the dead fish in the threeyear instanc it so
fell out that i wa in the boat both time first and last and the
last time distinctli recogn a peculiar sort of huge mole under the
whale ey which i had observ there three year previou i sai
three year but i am pretti sure it wa more than that here ar three
instanc then which i person know the truth of but i have heard
of mani other instanc from person whose verac in the matter there
is no good ground to impeach
secondli it is well known in the sperm whale fisheri howev ignor
the world ashor mai be of it that there have been sever memor
histor instanc where a particular whale in the ocean ha been at
distant time and place popularli cognis why such a whale becam
thu mark wa not altogeth and origin ow to hi bodili
peculiar as distinguish from other whale for howev peculiar
in that respect ani chanc whale mai be thei soon put an end to hi
peculiar by kill him and boil him down into a peculiarli
valuabl oil no the reason wa thi that from the fatal experi
of the fisheri there hung a terribl prestig of peril about
such a whale as there did about rinaldo rinaldini insomuch that most
fishermen were content to recognis him by mere touch their
tarpaulin when he would be discov loung by them on the sea
without seek to cultiv a more intim acquaint like some
poor devil ashor that happen to know an irasc great man thei
make distant unobtrus salut to him in the street lest if thei
pursu the acquaint further thei might receiv a summari thump
for their presumpt
but not onli did each of these famou whale enjoi great individu
celebritynai you mai call it an oceanwid renown not onli wa he
famou in life and now is immort in forecastl stori after death
but he wa admit into all the right privileg and distinct
of a name had as much a name inde as cambys or csar wa it not
so o timor tom thou fame leviathan scar like an iceberg who so
long didst lurk in the orient strait of that name whose spout wa
oft seen from the palmi beach of ombai wa it not so o new zealand
jack thou terror of all cruiser that cross their wake in the
vicin of the tattoo land wa it not so o morquan king of japan
whose lofti jet thei sai at time assum the semblanc of a snowwhit
cross against the sky wa it not so o don miguel thou chilian whale
mark like an old tortois with mystic hieroglyph upon the back in
plain prose here ar four whale as well known to the student of
cetacean histori as mariu or sylla to the classic scholar
but thi is not all new zealand tom and don miguel after at variou
time creat great havoc among the boat of differ vessel were
final gone in quest of systemat hunt out chase and kill
by valiant whale captain who heav up their anchor with that
express object as much in view as in set out through the
narragansett wood captain butler of old had it in hi mind to captur
that notori murder savag annawon the headmost warrior of the
indian king philip
i do not know where i can find a better place than just here to make
mention of on or two other thing which to me seem import as in
print form establish in all respect the reason of the
whole stori of the white whale more especi the catastroph for
thi is on of those dishearten instanc where truth requir full
as much bolster as error so ignor ar most landsmen of some of
the plainest and most palpabl wonder of the world that without some
hint touch the plain fact histor and otherwis of the
fisheri thei might scout at mobi dick as a monstrou fabl or still
wors and more detest a hideou and intoler allegori
first though most men have some vagu flit idea of the gener
peril of the grand fisheri yet thei have noth like a fix vivid
concept of those peril and the frequenc with which thei recur
on reason perhap is that not on in fifti of the actual disast
and death by casualti in the fisheri ever find a public record at
home howev transient and immedi forgotten that record do you
suppos that that poor fellow there who thi moment perhap caught by
the whalelin off the coast of new guinea is be carri down to
the bottom of the sea by the sound leviathando you suppos that
that poor fellow name will appear in the newspap obituari you will
read tomorrow at your breakfast no becaus the mail ar veri
irregular between here and new guinea in fact did you ever hear what
might be call regular new direct or indirect from new guinea yet i
tell you that upon on particular voyag which i made to the pacif
among mani other we spoke thirti differ ship everi on of which
had had a death by a whale some of them more than on and three that
had each lost a boat crew for god sake be econom with your
lamp and candl not a gallon you burn but at least on drop of
man blood wa spill for it
secondli peopl ashor have inde some indefinit idea that a whale
is an enorm creatur of enorm power but i have ever found that
when narrat to them some specif exampl of thi twofold
enorm thei have significantli compliment me upon my
faceti when i declar upon my soul i had no more idea of
be faceti than mose when he wrote the histori of the plagu of
egypt
but fortun the special point i here seek can be establish upon
testimoni entir independ of my own that point is thi the sperm
whale is in some case suffici power know and judici
malici as with direct aforethought to stave in utterli destroi
and sink a larg ship and what is more the sperm whale ha done it
first in the year 1820 the ship essex captain pollard of nantucket
wa cruis in the pacif ocean on dai she saw spout lower her
boat and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whale er long sever of
the whale were wound when suddenli a veri larg whale escap
from the boat issu from the shoal and bore directli down upon the
ship dash hi forehead against her hull he so stove her in that
in less than ten minut she settl down and fell over not a
surviv plank of her ha been seen sinc after the severest
exposur part of the crew reach the land in their boat be
return home at last captain pollard onc more sail for the pacif
in command of anoth ship but the god shipwreck him again upon
unknown rock and breaker for the second time hi ship wa utterli
lost and forthwith forswear the sea he ha never tempt it sinc
at thi dai captain pollard is a resid of nantucket i have seen
owen chace who wa chief mate of the essex at the time of the tragedi
i have read hi plain and faith narr i have convers with hi
son and all thi within a few mile of the scene of the
catastrophe8
8 the follow ar extract from chace narr everi fact
seem to warrant me in conclud that it wa anyth but chanc
which direct hi oper he made two sever attack upon the
ship at a short interv between them both of which accord to
their direct were calcul to do us the most injuri by be
made ahead and therebi combin the speed of the two object for the
shock to effect which the exact manuvr which he made were
necessari hi aspect wa most horribl and such as indic
resent and furi he came directli from the shoal which we had just
befor enter and in which we had struck three of hi companion as
if fire with reveng for their suffer again at all event
the whole circumst taken togeth all happen befor my own
ey and produc at the time impress in my mind of decid
calcul mischief on the part of the whale mani of which
impress i cannot now recal induc me to be satisfi that i am
correct in my opinion
here ar hi reflect some time after quit the ship dure
a black night in an open boat when almost despair of reach
ani hospit shore the dark ocean and swell water were
noth the fear of be swallow up by some dread tempest
or dash upon hidden rock with all the other ordinari subject
of fear contempl seem scarc entitl to a moment
thought the dismal look wreck and the horrid aspect and
reveng of the whale wholli engross my reflect until dai
again made it appear
in anoth placep 45he speak of the mysteri and mortal
attack of the anim
secondli the ship union also of nantucket wa in the year 1807
total lost off the azor by a similar onset but the authent
particular of thi catastroph i have never chanc to encount
though from the whale hunter i have now and then heard casual
allus to it
thirdli some eighteen or twenti year ago commodor j then
command an american sloopofwar of the first class happen to be
dine with a parti of whale captain on board a nantucket ship in
the harbor of oahu sandwich island convers turn upon whale
the commodor wa pleas to be sceptic touch the amaz strength
ascrib to them by the profession gentlemen present he peremptorili
deni for exampl that ani whale could so smite hi stout
sloopofwar as to caus her to leak so much as a thimbl veri
good but there is more come some week after the commodor set
sail in thi impregn craft for valparaiso but he wa stop on
the wai by a portli sperm whale that beg a few moment
confidenti busi with him that busi consist in fetch the
commodor craft such a thwack that with all hi pump go he made
straight for the nearest port to heav down and repair i am not
superstiti but i consid the commodor interview with that whale
as providenti wa not saul of tarsu convert from unbelief by a
similar fright i tell you the sperm whale will stand no nonsens
i will now refer you to langsdorff voyag for a littl circumst
in point peculiarli interest to the writer hereof langsdorff you
must know by the wai wa attach to the russian admir krusenstern
famou discoveri expedit in the begin of the present centuri
captain langsdorff thu begin hi seventeenth chapter
by the thirteenth of mai our ship wa readi to sail and the next dai
we were out in the open sea on our wai to ochotsh the weather wa
veri clear and fine but so intoler cold that we were oblig to
keep on our fur cloth for some dai we had veri littl wind it wa
not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up
an uncommon larg whale the bodi of which wa larger than the ship
itself lai almost at the surfac of the water but wa not perceiv
by ani on on board till the moment when the ship which wa in full
sail wa almost upon him so that it wa imposs to prevent it
strike against him we were thu place in the most immin danger
as thi gigant creatur set up it back rais the ship three
feet at least out of the water the mast reel and the sail fell
altogeth while we who were below all sprang instantli upon the deck
conclud that we had struck upon some rock instead of thi we saw
the monster sail off with the utmost graviti and solemn captain
dwolf appli immedi to the pump to examin whether or not the
vessel had receiv ani damag from the shock but we found that veri
happili it had escap entir uninjur
now the captain dwolf here allud to as command the ship in
question is a new england who after a long life of unusu
adventur as a seacaptain thi dai resid in the villag of
dorchest near boston i have the honor of be a nephew of hi i
have particularli question him concern thi passag in langsdorff
he substanti everi word the ship howev wa by no mean a larg
on a russian craft built on the siberian coast and purchas by my
uncl after barter awai the vessel in which he sail from home
in that up and down manli book of oldfashion adventur so full
too of honest wondersth voyag of lionel wafer on of ancient
dampier old chumsi found a littl matter set down so like that just
quot from langsdorff that i cannot forbear insert it here for a
corrobor exampl if such be need
lionel it seem wa on hi wai to john ferdinando as he call the
modern juan fernand in our wai thither he sai about four
oclock in the morn when we were about on hundr and fifti
leagu from the main of america our ship felt a terribl shock which
put our men in such constern that thei could hardli tell where
thei were or what to think but everi on began to prepar for death
and inde the shock wa so sudden and violent that we took it for
grant the ship had struck against a rock but when the amaz wa
a littl over we cast the lead and sound but found no ground
the sudden of the shock made the gun leap in their carriag and
sever of the men were shaken out of their hammock captain davi
who lai with hi head on a gun wa thrown out of hi cabin lionel
then goe on to imput the shock to an earthquak and seem to
substanti the imput by state that a great earthquak
somewher about that time did actual do great mischief along the
spanish land but i should not much wonder if in the dark of that
earli hour of the morn the shock wa after all caus by an unseen
whale vertic bump the hull from beneath
i might proce with sever more exampl on wai or anoth known to
me of the great power and malic at time of the sperm whale in more
than on instanc he ha been known not onli to chase the assail
boat back to their ship but to pursu the ship itself and long
withstand all the lanc hurl at him from it deck the english ship
pusi hall can tell a stori on that head and as for hi strength let
me sai that there have been exampl where the line attach to a
run sperm whale have in a calm been transfer to the ship and
secur there the whale tow her great hull through the water as a
hors walk off with a cart again it is veri often observ that if
the sperm whale onc struck is allow time to ralli he then act
not so often with blind rage as with wil deliber design of
destruct to hi pursuer nor is it without convei some eloqu
indic of hi charact that upon be attack he will
frequent open hi mouth and retain it in that dread expans for
sever consecut minut but i must be content with onli on more
and a conclud illustr a remark and most signific on
by which you will not fail to see that not onli is the most marvel
event in thi book corrobor by plain fact of the present dai but
that these marvel like all marvel ar mere repetit of the ag
so that for the millionth time we sai amen with solomonverili there is
noth new under the sun
in the sixth christian centuri live procopiu a christian magistr
of constantinopl in the dai when justinian wa emperor and
belisariu gener as mani know he wrote the histori of hi own
time a work everi wai of uncommon valu by the best author he
ha alwai been consid a most trustworthi and unexagger
historian except in some on or two particular not at all affect
the matter present to be mention
now in thi histori of hi procopiu mention that dure the term
of hi prefectur at constantinopl a great seamonst wa captur
in the neighbor proponti or sea of marmora after have destroi
vessel at interv in those water for a period of more than fifti
year a fact thu set down in substanti histori cannot easili be
gainsaid nor is there ani reason it should be of what precis speci
thi seamonst wa is not mention but as he destroi ship as
well as for other reason he must have been a whale and i am strongli
inclin to think a sperm whale and i will tell you why for a long
time i fanci that the sperm whale had been alwai unknown in the
mediterranean and the deep water connect with it even now i am
certain that those sea ar not and perhap never can be in the
present constitut of thing a place for hi habitu gregari
resort but further investig have recent prove to me that in
modern time there have been isol instanc of the presenc of the
sperm whale in the mediterranean i am told on good author that on
the barbari coast a commodor davi of the british navi found the
skeleton of a sperm whale now as a vessel of war readili pass
through the dardanel henc a sperm whale could by the same rout
pass out of the mediterranean into the proponti
in the proponti as far as i can learn none of that peculiar
substanc call brit is to be found the aliment of the right whale
but i have everi reason to believ that the food of the sperm
whalesquid or cuttlefishlurk at the bottom of that sea becaus
larg creatur but by no mean the largest of that sort have been
found at it surfac if then you properli put these statement
togeth and reason upon them a bit you will clearli perceiv that
accord to all human reason procopiuss seamonst that for
half a centuri stove the ship of a roman emperor must in all
probabl have been a sperm whale
chapter xlvi surmis
though consum with the hot fire of hi purpos ahab in all hi

dick though he seem readi to sacrific all mortal interest to that

insan of ahab respect mobi dick wa nowai more significantli
manifest than in hi superl sens and shrewd in forese
that for the present the hunt should in some wai be strip of that
strang imagin impious which natur invest it that the
full terror of the voyag must be kept withdrawn into the obscur

of the gener joke there is noth like the peril of whale to
breed thi free and easi sort of genial desperado philosophi and with
it i now regard thi whole voyag of the pequod and the great white

queequeg said i when thei had drag me the last man to the

for an oarsman to break hi own back pull himself backforemost into

cant you twist that smaller said flask ye that the law i
should like to see a boat crew back water up to a whale face

here then from three imparti wit i had a deliber statement
of the entir case consid therefor that squall and capsiz

my life into the hand of him who steer the boatoftentim a fellow
who at that veri moment is in hi impetu upon the point of
scuttl the craft with hi own frantic stamp consid that
the particular disast to our own particular boat wa chiefli to be
imput to starbuck drive on to hi whale almost in the teeth of a

all thing togeth i sai i thought i might as well go below and make
a rough draft of my will queequeg said i come along you shall be

it mai seem strang that of all men sailor should be tinker at

more fond of that divers thi wa the fourth time in my nautic

man to enter a whaleboat in the hunt as a gener thing the
jointown of the pequod must have plainli thought not
ahab well knew that although hi friend at home would think littl of
hi enter a boat in certain compar harmless vicissitud of
the chase for the sake of be near the scene of action and give
hi order in person yet for captain ahab to have a boat actual
apport to him as a regular headsman in the huntabov all for
captain ahab to be suppli with five extra men as that same boat
crew he well knew that such gener conceit never enter the head
of the owner of the pequod therefor he had not solicit a boat
crew from them nor had he in ani wai hint hi desir on that head
nevertheless he had taken privat measur of hi own touch all that
matter until cabaco publish discoveri the sailor had littl
foreseen it though to be sure when after be a littl while out of

whaleboat for servic when some time after thi ahab wa now and then
found bestir himself in the matter of make tholepin with hi
own hand for what wa thought to be on of the spare boat and even
solicit cut the small wooden skewer which when the line is
run out ar pin over the groov in the bow when all thi wa
observ in him and particularli hi solicitud in have an extra
coat of sheath in the bottom of the boat as if to make it better
withstand the point pressur of hi ivori limb and also the anxieti
he evinc in exactli shape the thigh board or clumsi cleat as it
is sometim call the horizont piec in the boat bow for brace
the knee against in dart or stab at the whale when it wa
observ how often he stood up in that boat with hi solitari knee
fix in the semicircular depress in the cleat and with the
carpent chisel goug out a littl here and straighten it a
littl there all these thing i sai had awaken much interest and
curios at the time but almost everybodi suppos that thi

been that by the process of hail he had obtain a neg answer

all thi might remain inadequ estim were not someth said

captain offic and not a few of the men ar person known to
each other and consequ have all sort of dear domest thing to
talk about
for the long absent ship the outwardbound perhap ha letter on
board at ani rate she will be sure to let her have some paper of a
date a year or two later than the last on on her blur and
thumbworn file and in return for that courtesi the outwardbound
ship would receiv the latest whale intellig from the
cruisingground to which she mai be destin a thing of the utmost
import to her and in degre all thi will hold true concern
whale vessel cross each other track on the cruisingground
itself even though thei ar equal long absent from home for on of
them mai have receiv a transfer of letter from some third and now
far remot vessel and some of those letter mai be for the peopl of
the ship she now meet besid thei would exchang the whale new
and have an agreeabl chat for not onli would thei meet with all the
sympathi of sailor but likewis with all the peculiar
congeni aris from a common pursuit and mutual share
privat and peril
nor would differ of countri make ani veri essenti differ
that is so long as both parti speak on languag as is the case
with american and english though to be sure from the small number
of english whaler such meet do not veri often occur and when
thei do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them
for your englishman is rather reserv and your yanke he doe not
fanci that sort of thing in anybodi but himself besid the english
whaler sometim affect a kind of metropolitan superior over the
american whaler regard the long lean nantucket with hi
nondescript provinci as a sort of seapeas but where thi
superior in the english whalemen doe realli consist it would be
hard to sai see that the yanke in on dai collect kill
more whale than all the english collect in ten year but thi
is a harmless littl foibl in the english whalehunt which the
nantucket doe not take much to heart probabl becaus he know
that he ha a few foibl himself
so then we see that of all ship separ sail the sea the
whaler have most reason to be sociableand thei ar so wherea some
merchant ship cross each other wake in the midatlant will
oftentim pass on without so much as a singl word of recognit
mutual cut each other on the high sea like a brace of dandi
in broadwai and all the time indulg perhap in finic critic
upon each other rig as for menofwar when thei chanc to meet at
sea thei first go through such a string of silli bow and
scrape such a duck of ensign that there doe not seem to be
much rightdown hearti goodwil and brotherli love about it at all as
touch slaveship meet why thei ar in such a prodigi hurri
thei run awai from each other as soon as possibl and as for pirat
when thei chanc to cross each other crossbon the first hail
ishow mani skullsth same wai that whaler hailhow mani
barrel and that question onc answer pirat straightwai steer
apart for thei ar infern villain on both side and dont like to
see overmuch of each other villan like
but look at the godli honest unostentati hospit sociabl
freeandeasi whaler what doe the whaler do when she meet anoth
whaler in ani sort of decent weather she ha a gam a thing so
utterli unknown to all other ship that thei never heard of the name
even and if by chanc thei should hear of it thei onli grin at it
and repeat gamesom stuff about spouter and blubberboil and
such like pretti exclam why it is that all merchantseamen and
also all pirat and manofwar men and slaveship sailor cherish
such a scorn feel toward whaleship thi is a question it
would be hard to answer becaus in the case of pirat sai i should
like to know whether that profess of their ha ani peculiar glori
about it it sometim end in uncommon elev inde but onli at
the gallow and besid when a man is elev in that odd fashion
he ha no proper foundat for hi superior altitud henc i
conclud that in boast himself to be high lift abov a whaleman
in that assert the pirat ha no solid basi to stand on
but what is a gam you might wear out your indexfing run up
and down the column of dictionari and never find the word dr
johnson never attain to that erudit noah webster ark doe not
hold it nevertheless thi same express word ha now for mani year
been in constant us among some fifteen thousand true born yanke
certainli it need a definit and should be incorpor into the
lexicon with that view let me learnedli defin it
gam nouna social meet of two or more whaleship gener
on a cruisingground when after exchang hail thei exchang
visit by boat crew the two captain remain for the time on
board of on ship and the two chief mate on the other
there is anoth littl item about gam which must not be forgotten
here all profess have their own littl peculiar of detail so
ha the whale fisheri in a pirat manofwar or slave ship when the
captain is row anywher in hi boat he alwai sit in the stern
sheet on a comfort sometim cushion seat there and often
steer himself with a pretti littl millin tiller decor with
gai cord and ribbon but the whaleboat ha no seat astern no sofa
of that sort whatev and no tiller at all high time inde if
whale captain were wheel about the water on castor like gouti old
aldermen in patent chair and as for a tiller the whaleboat never
admit of ani such effeminaci and therefor as in gam a complet
boat crew must leav the ship and henc as the boat steerer or
harpoon is of the number that subordin is the steersman upon the
occas and the captain have no place to sit in is pull off to
hi visit all stand like a pine tree and often you will notic that
be consciou of the ey of the whole visibl world rest on him
from the side of the two ship thi stand captain is all aliv to
the import of sustain hi digniti by maintain hi leg nor
is thi ani veri easi matter for in hi rear is the immens project
steer oar hit him now and then in the small of hi back the
afteroar reciproc by rap hi knee in front he is thu
complet wedg befor and behind and can onli expand himself
sidewai by settl down on hi stretch leg but a sudden violent
pitch of the boat will often go far to toppl him becaus length of
foundat is noth without correspond breadth mere make a
spread angl of two pole and you cannot stand them up then again
it would never do in plain sight of the world rivet ey it would
never do i sai for thi straddl captain to be seen steadi
himself the slightest particl by catch hold of anyth with hi
hand inde as token of hi entir buoyant selfcommand he
gener carri hi hand in hi trowser pocket but perhap be
gener veri larg heavi hand he carri them there for ballast
nevertheless there have occur instanc well authent on
too where the captain ha been known for an uncommonli critic moment
or two in a sudden squall sayto seiz hold of the nearest oarsman
hair and hold on there like grim death

he could not well withhold the rest nevertheless so potent an

some two year prior to my first learn the event which i am about
rehears to you gentlemen the townho sperm whaler of nantucket
wa cruis in your pacif here not veri mani dai sail westward
from the eav of thi good golden inn she wa somewher to the
northward of the line on morn upon handl the pump accord
to daili usag it wa observ that she made more water in her hold
than common thei suppos a swordfish had stab her gentlemen but
the captain have some unusu reason for believ that rare good
luck await him in those latitud and therefor be veri avers to
quit them and the leak not be then consid at all danger
though inde thei could not find it after search the hold as low
down as wa possibl in rather heavi weather the ship still continu
her cruis the marin work at the pump at wide and easi
interv but no good luck came more dai went by and not onli wa
the leak yet undiscov but it sensibl increas so much so that
now take some alarm the captain make all sail stood awai for the
nearest harbor among the island there to have hi hull hove out and
repair
though no small passag wa befor her yet if the commonest chanc
favor he did not at all fear that hi ship would founder by the wai
becaus hi pump were of the best and be period reliev at
them those sixandthirti men of hi could easili keep the ship free
never mind if the leak should doubl on her in truth well nigh the
whole of thi passag be attend by veri prosper breez the

steelkiltbut gentlemen you shall hear
it wa not more than a dai or two at the furthest after point her
prow for her island haven that the townho leak seem again
increas but onli so as to requir an hour or more at the pump
everi dai you must know that in a settl and civil ocean like our
atlant for exampl some skipper think littl of pump their
whole wai across it though of a still sleepi night should the
offic of the deck happen to forget hi duti in that respect the
probabl would be that he and hi shipmat would never again
rememb it on account of all hand gentli subsid to the bottom
nor in the solitari and savag sea far from you to the westward
gentlemen is it altogeth unusu for ship to keep clang at their
pumphandl in full choru even for a voyag of consider length
that is if it lie along a toler access coast or if ani other
reason retreat is afford them it is onli when a leaki vessel is
in some veri out of the wai part of those water some realli landless
latitud that her captain begin to feel a littl anxiou
much thi wai had it been with the townho so when her leak wa found
gain onc more there wa in truth some small concern manifest by
sever of her compani especi by radnei the mate he command the
upper sail to be well hoist sheet home anew and everi wai
expand to the breez now thi radnei i suppos wa as littl of a
coward and as littl inclin to ani sort of nervou apprehens
touch hi own person as ani fearless unthink creatur on land or
on sea that you can conveni imagin gentlemen therefor when he
betrai thi solicitud about the safeti of the ship some of the
seamen declar that it wa onli on account of hi be a part owner
in her so when thei were work that even at the pump there wa
on thi head no small gamesom slili go on among them as thei
stood with their feet continu overflow by the rippl clear
water clear as ani mountain spring gentlementhat bubbl from the
pump ran across the deck and pour itself out in steadi spout at
the lee scupperhol
now as you well know it is not seldom the case in thi convent
world of ourswateri or otherwis that when a person place in command
over hi fellowmen find on of them to be veri significantli hi
superior in gener pride of manhood straightwai against that man he
conceiv an unconquer dislik and bitter and if he have a
chanc he will pull down and pulver that subaltern tower and make
a littl heap of dust of it be thi conceit of mine as it mai
gentlemen at all event steelkilt wa a tall and nobl anim with a
head like a roman and a flow golden beard like the tassel
hous of your last viceroi snort charger and a brain and a
heart and a soul in him gentlemen which had made steelkilt
charlemagn had he been born son to charlemagn father but radnei
the mate wa ugli as a mule yet as hardi as stubborn as malici
he did not love steelkilt and steelkilt knew it
espi the mate draw near as he wa toil at the pump with the
rest the lakeman affect not to notic him but unaw went on with
hi gai banter
ay ay my merri lad it a live leak thi hold a cannikin
on of ye and let have a tast by the lord it worth bottl i
tell ye what men old rad invest must go for it he had best cut
awai hi part of the hull and tow it home the fact is boi that
swordfish onli began the job he come back again with a gang of
shipcarpent sawfish and filefish and what not and the whole
poss of em ar now hard at work cut and slash at the bottom
make improv i suppos if old rad were here now id tell him
to jump overboard and scatter em theyr plai the devil with hi
estat i can tell him but he a simpl old soulrad and a beauti
too boi thei sai the rest of hi properti is invest in
lookingglass i wonder if hed give a poor devil like me the model
of hi nose
damn your ey what that pump stop for roar radnei
pretend not to have heard the sailor talk thunder awai at it
ay ay sir said steelkilt merri as a cricket live boi
live now and with that the pump clang like fifti fireengin
the men toss their hat off to it and er long that peculiar gasp
of the lung wa heard which denot the fullest tension of life
utmost energi
quit the pump at last with the rest of hi band the lakeman went
forward all pant and sat himself down on the windlass hi face
fieri red hi ey bloodshot and wipe the profus sweat from hi
brow now what cozen fiend it wa gentlemen that possess radnei
to meddl with such a man in that corpor exasper state i know
not but so it happen intoler stride along the deck the mate
command him to get a broom and sweep down the plank and also a
shovel and remov some offens matter consequ upon allow a
pig to run at larg
now gentlemen sweep a ship deck at sea is a piec of household
work which in all time but rage gale is regularli attend to everi
even it ha been known to be done in the case of ship actual
founder at the time such gentlemen is the inflex of
seausag and the instinct love of neat in seamen some of whom
would not willingli drown without first wash their face but in all
vessel thi broom busi is the prescript provinc of the boi
if boi there be aboard besid it wa the stronger men in the
townho that had been divid into gang take turn at the pump
and be the most athlet seaman of them all steelkilt had been
regularli assign captain of on of the gang consequ he should
have been freed from ani trivial busi not connect with truli
nautic duti such be the case with hi comrad i mention all
these particular so that you mai understand exactli how thi affair
stood between the two men
but there wa more than thi the order about the shovel wa almost as
plainli meant to sting and insult steelkilt as though radnei had spat
in hi face ani man who ha gone sailor in a whaleship will
understand thi and all thi and doubtless much more the lakeman
fulli comprehend when the mate utter hi command but as he sat
still for a moment and as he steadfastli look into the mate
malign ey and perceiv the stack of powdercask heap up in him
and the slowmatch silent burn along toward them as he
instinct saw all thi that strang forbear and unwilling
to stir up the deeper passion in ani alreadi ir beinga
repugn most felt when felt at all by realli valiant men even when
aggrievedthi nameless phantom feel gentlemen stole over
steelkilt
therefor in hi ordinari tone onli a littl broken by the bodili
exhaust he wa temporarili in he answer him sai that sweep
the deck wa not hi busi and he would not do it and then
without at all allud to the shovel he point to three lad as the
customari sweeper who not be billet at the pump had done
littl or noth all dai to thi radnei repli with an oath in a
most domin and outrag manner uncondition reiter hi

uplift cooper club hammer which he had snatch from a cask near
by
heat and irrit as he wa by hi spasmod toil at the pump for
all hi first nameless feel of forbear the sweat steelkilt
could but ill brook thi bear in the mate but somehow still
smother the conflagr within him without speak he remain
doggedli root to hi seat till at last the incens radnei shook the
hammer within a few inch of hi face furious command him to do
hi bid
steelkilt rose and slowli retreat round the windlass steadili
follow by the mate with hi menac hammer deliber repeat
hi intent not to obei see howev that hi forbear had
not the slightest effect by an aw and unspeak intim with
hi twist hand he warn off the foolish and infatu man but it
wa to no purpos and in thi wai the two went onc slowli round the
windlass when resolv at last no longer to retreat bethink him
that he had now forborn as much as comport with hi humor the
lakeman paus on the hatch and thu spoke to the offic
mr radnei i will not obei you take that hammer awai or look to
yourself but the predestin mate come still closer to him where
the lakeman stood fix now shook the heavi hammer within an inch of
hi teeth meanwhil repeat a string of insuffer maledict
retreat not the thousandth part of an inch stab him in the ey
with the unflinch poniard of hi glanc steelkilt clench hi
right hand behind him and creepingli draw it back told hi
persecutor that if the hammer but graze hi cheek he steelkilt would
murder him but gentlemen the fool had been brand for the slaughter
by the god immedi the hammer touch the cheek the next instant
the lower jaw of the mate wa stove in hi head he fell on the hatch

handl at each end run a muck from the bowsprit to the taffrail and
if by ani devilish of desper possibl seiz the ship for
himself he would do thi he said whether thei join him or not
that wa the last night he should spend in that den but the scheme met
with no opposit on the part of the other two thei swore thei were
readi for that or for ani other mad thing for anyth in short but a
surrend and what wa more thei each insist upon be the first
man on deck when the time to make the rush should come but to thi
their leader as fierc object reserv that prioriti for himself
particularli as hi two comrad would not yield the on to the other
in the matter and both of them could not be first for the ladder
would but admit on man at a time and here gentlemen the foul plai
of these miscreant must come out
upon hear the frantic project of their leader each in hi own
separ soul had suddenli light it would seem upon the same piec
of treacheri name to be foremost in break out in order to be
the first of the three though the last of the ten to surrend and
therebi secur whatev small chanc of pardon such conduct might
merit but when steelkilt made known hi determin still to lead
them to the last thei in some wai by some subtl chemistri of
villani mix their befor secret treacheri togeth and when their
leader fell into a doze verbal open their soul to each other in
three sentenc and bound the sleeper with cord and gag him with
cord and shriek out for the captain at midnight
think murder at hand and smell in the dark for the blood he
and all hi arm mate and harpoon rush for the forecastl in a
few minut the scuttl wa open and bound hand and foot the still
struggl ringlead wa shove up into the air by hi perfidi
alli who at onc claim the honor of secur a man who had been
fulli ripe for murder but all these were collar and drag along
the deck like dead cattl and side by side were seiz up into the
mizen rig like three quarter of meat and there thei hung till
morn damn ye cri the captain pace to and fro befor them
the vultur would not touch ye ye villain
at sunris he summon all hand and separ those who had
rebel from those who had taken no part in the mutini he told the
former that he had a good mind to flog them all roundthought upon the
whole he would do sohe ought tojustic demand it but for the
present consid their time surrend he would let them go with
a reprimand which he accordingli administ in the vernacular
but as for you ye carrion rogu turn to the three men in the
riggingfor you i mean to minc ye up for the trypot and seiz
a rope he appli it with all hi might to the back of the two
traitor till thei yell no more but lifelessli hung their head
sidewai as the two crucifi thiev ar drawn
my wrist is sprain with ye he cri at last but there is still
rope enough left for you my fine bantam that wouldnt give up take
that gag from hi mouth and let us hear what he can sai for himself
for a moment the exhaust mutin made a tremul motion of hi
cramp jaw and then painfulli twist round hi head said in a
sort of hiss what i sai is thisand mind it wellif you flog me i
murder you
sai ye so then see how ye frighten meand the captain drew off with
the rope to strike
best not hiss the lakeman
but i mustand the rope wa onc more drawn back for the stroke
steelkilt here hiss out someth inaud to all but the captain
who to the amaz of all hand start back pace the deck
rapidli two or three time and then suddenli throw down hi rope
said i wont do itlet him gocut him down dye hear
but as the junior mate were hurri to execut the order a pale
man with a bandag head arrest themradnei the chief mate ever
sinc the blow he had lain in hi berth but that morn hear the
tumult on the deck he had crept out and thu far had watch the
whole scene such wa the state of hi mouth that he could hardli
speak but mumbl someth about hi be will and abl to do
what the captain dare not attempt he snatch the rope and advanc
to hi pinion foe
you ar a coward hiss the lakeman
so i am but take that the mate wa in the veri act of strike
when anoth hiss stai hi uplift arm he paus and then paus
no more made good hi word spite of steelkilt threat whatev that
might have been the three men were then cut down all hand were
turn to and sullenli work by the moodi seamen the iron pump
clang as befor
just after dark that dai when on watch had retir below a clamor
wa heard in the forecastl and the two trembl traitor run up
besieg the cabin door sai thei durst not consort with the crew
entreati cuff and kick could not drive them back so at their own
instanc thei were put down in the ship run for salvat still no
sign of mutini reappear among the rest on the contrari it seem
that mainli at steelkilt instig thei had resolv to maintain
the strictest peac obei all order to the last and when the
ship reach port desert her in a bodi but in order to insur the
speediest end to the voyag thei all agre to anoth thingnam
not to sing out for whale in case ani should be discov for
spite of her leak and spite of all her other peril the townho still
maintain her masthead and her captain wa just as will to lower
for a fish that moment as on the dai hi craft first struck the
cruis ground and radnei the mate wa quit as readi to chang hi
berth for a boat and with hi bandag mouth seek to gag in death the
vital jaw of the whale
but though the lakeman had induc the seamen to adopt thi sort of
passiv in their conduct he kept hi own counsel at least till
all wa over concern hi own proper and privat reveng upon the
man who had stung him in the ventricl of hi heart he wa in radnei
the chief mate watch and as if the infatu man sought to run more
than half wai to meet hi doom after the scene at the rig he
insist against the express counsel of the captain upon resum the
head of hi watch at night upon thi and on or two other
circumst steelkilt systemat built the plan of hi reveng
dure the night radnei had an unseamanlik wai of sit on the
bulwark of the quarterdeck and lean hi arm upon the gunwal of
the boat which wa hoist up there a littl abov the ship side in
thi attitud it wa well known he sometim doze there wa a
consider vacanc between the boat and the ship and down between
thi wa the sea steelkilt calcul hi time and found that hi
next trick at the helm would come round at two oclock in the morn
of the third dai from that in which he had been betrai at hi
leisur he emploi the interv in braid someth veri carefulli
in hi watch below
what ar you make there said a shipmat
what do you think what doe it look like
like a lanyard for your bag but it an odd on seem to me
ye rather oddish said the lakeman hold it at arm length
befor him but i think it will answer shipmat i havent enough
twinehav you ani
but there wa none in the forecastl
then i must get some from old rad and he rose to go aft
you dont mean to go a beg to him said a sailor
why not do you think he wont do me a turn when it to help
himself in the end shipmat and go to the mate he look at him
quietli and ask him for some twine to mend hi hammock it wa given
himneith twine nor lanyard were seen again but the next night an
iron ball close net partli roll from the pocket of the
lakeman monkei jacket as he wa tuck the coat into hi hammock
for a pillow twentyfour hour after hi trick at the silent
helmnigh to the man who wa apt to doze over the grave alwai readi
dug to the seaman handthat fatal hour wa then to come and in the
foreordain soul of steelkilt the mate wa alreadi stark and
stretch as a corps with hi forehead crush in
but gentlemen a fool save the wouldb murder from the bloodi
deed he had plan yet complet reveng he had and without be the
aveng for by a mysteri fatal heaven itself seem to step in
to take out of hi hand into it own the damn thing he would have
done
it wa just between daybreak and sunris of the morn of the second

while radnei stood up with hi lanc in the prow and haul in or
slacken the line at the word of command moreov when the four boat
were lower the mate got the start and none howl more fierc
with delight than did steelkilt as he strain at hi oar after a
stiff pull their harpoon got fast and spear in hand radnei
sprang to the bow he wa alwai a furiou man it seem in a boat
and now hi bandag cry wa to beach him on the whale topmost back
noth loath hi bowsman haul him up and up through a blind

struck as against a sunken ledg and keel over spill out the

out through the sprai and for an instant wa dimli seen through that
veil wildli seek to remov himself from the ey of mobi dick but
the whale rush round in a sudden maelstrom seiz the swimmer
between hi jaw and rear high up with him plung headlong again
and went down
meantim at the first tap of the boat bottom the lakeman had
slacken the line so as to drop astern from the whirlpool calmli
look on he thought hi own thought but a sudden terrif
downward jerk of the boat quickli brought hi knife to the line he
cut it and the whale wa free but at some distanc mobi dick rose
again with some tatter of radnei red woollen shirt caught in the

upon the island to assist him in the labori busi of heav
down the ship to stop the leak but to such unrest vigil over
their danger alli wa thi small band of white necessit both
by night and by dai and so extrem wa the hard work thei underw
that upon the vessel be readi again for sea thei were in such a
weaken condit that the captain durst not put off with them in so
heavi a vessel after take counsel with hi offic he anchor the
ship as far off shore as possibl load and ran out hi two cannon
from the bow stack hi musket on the poop and warn the
island not to approach the ship at their peril took on man with
him and set the sail of hi best whaleboat steer straight
befor the wind for tahiti five hundr mile distant to procur a

on the fourth dai of the sail a larg cano wa descri which
seem to have touch at a low isl of coral he steer awai from

steelkilt hail him to heav to or he would run him under water the
captain present a pistol with on foot on each prow of the yoke
warcano the lakeman laugh him to scorn assur him that if the
pistol so much as click in the lock he would buri him in bubbl and
foam
what do you want of me cri the captain
where ar you bound and for what ar you bound demand steelkilt

a pretti scholar laugh the lakeman adio senor and leap

chapter lv of the monstrou pictur of whale
i shall er long paint to you as well as on can without canva
someth like the true form of the whale as he actual appear to the
ey of the whaleman when in hi own absolut bodi the whale is moor
alongsid the whaleship so that he can be fairli step upon there
it mai be worth while therefor previous to advert to those curiou
imaginari portrait of him which even down to the present dai
confid challeng the faith of the landsman it is time to set the
world right in thi matter by prove such pictur of the whale all
wrong
it mai be that the primal sourc of all those pictori delus will
be found among the oldest hindoo egyptian and grecian sculptur for
ever sinc those invent but unscrupul time when on the marbl
panel of templ the pedest of statu and on shield
medallion cup and coin the dolphin wa drawn in scale of
chainarmor like saladin and a helmet head like st georg ever
sinc then ha someth of the same sort of licens prevail not
onli in most popular pictur of the whale but in mani scientif
present of him
now by all odd the most ancient extant portrait anywai purport
to be the whale is to be found in the famou cavernpagoda of
elephanta in india the brahmin maintain that in the almost endless
sculptur of that immemori pagoda all the trade and pursuit
everi conceiv avoc of man were prefigur ag befor ani of
them actual came into be no wonder then that in some sort our
nobl profess of whale should have been there shadow forth the
hindoo whale refer to occur in a separ depart of the wall
depict the incarn of vishnu in the form of leviathan learnedli
known as the mats avatar but though thi sculptur is half man and
half whale so as onli to give the tail of the latter yet that small
section of him is all wrong it look more like the taper tail of an
anaconda than the broad palm of the true whale majest fluke
but go to the old galleri and look now at a great christian
painter portrait of thi fish for he succe no better than the
antediluvian hindoo it is guido pictur of perseu rescu
andromeda from the seamonst or whale where did guido get the model
of such a strang creatur as that nor doe hogarth in paint the
same scene in hi own perseu descend make out on whit better
the huge corpul of that hogarthian monster undul on the
surfac scarc draw on inch of water it ha a sort of howdah on
it back and it distend tusk mouth into which the billow ar
roll might be taken for the traitor gate lead from the thame
by water into the tower then there ar the prodromu whale of the
old scotch sibbald and jonah whale as depict in the print of old
bibl and the cut of old primer what shall be said of these as for
the bookbind whale wind like a vinestalk round the stock of a
descend anchora stamp and gild on the back and titlepag of
mani book both old and newthat is a veri picturesqu but pure
fabul creatur imit i take it from the like figur on
antiqu vase though univers denomin a dolphin i nevertheless
call thi bookbind fish an attempt at a whale becaus it wa so
intend when the devic wa first introduc it wa introduc by an
old italian publish somewher about the 15th centuri dure the
reviv of learn and in those dai and even down to a
compar late period dolphin were popularli suppos to be a
speci of the leviathan
in the vignett and other embellish of some ancient book you
will at time meet with veri curiou touch at the whale where all
manner of spout jet deau hot spring and cold saratoga and
badenbaden come bubbl up from hi unexhaust brain in the
titlepag of the origin edit of the advanc of learn you
will find some curiou whale
but quit all these unprofession attempt let us glanc at those
pictur of leviathan purport to be sober scientif delin
by those who know in old harriss collect of voyag there ar some
plate of whale extract from a dutch book of voyag ad 1671
entitl a whale voyag to spitzbergen in the ship jona in the
whale peter peterson of friesland master in on of those plate the
whale like great raft of log ar repres ly among
iceisl with white bear run over their live back in anoth
plate the prodigi blunder is made of repres the whale with
perpendicular fluke
then again there is an impos quarto written by on captain
colnett a post captain in the english navi entitl a voyag round
cape horn into the south sea for the purpos of extend the
spermaceti whale fisheri in thi book is an outlin purport to
be a pictur of a physet or spermaceti whale drawn by scale from
on kill on the coast of mexico august 1793 and hoist on deck
i doubt not the captain had thi veraci pictur taken for the
benefit of hi marin to mention but on thing about it let me sai
that it ha an ey which appli accord to the accompani scale
to a full grown sperm whale would make the ey of that whale a
bowwindow some five feet long ah my gallant captain why did ye not
give us jonah look out of that ey
nor ar the most conscienti compil of natur histori for the
benefit of the young and tender free from the same heinous of
mistak look at that popular work goldsmith anim natur in
the abridg london edit of 1807 there ar plate of an alleg
whale and a narwhal i do not wish to seem ineleg but thi
unsightli whale look much like an amput sow and as for the
narwhal on glimps at it is enough to amaz on that in thi
nineteenth centuri such a hippogriff could be palm for genuin upon
ani intellig public of schoolboi
then again in 1825 bernard germain count de lacpd a great
naturalist publish a scientif system whale book wherein ar
sever pictur of the differ speci of the leviathan all these
ar not onli incorrect but the pictur of the mysticetu or greenland
whale that is to sai the right whale even scoresbi a long
experienc man as touch that speci declar not to have it
counterpart in natur
but the place of the capsheaf to all thi blunder busi wa
reserv for the scientif frederick cuvier brother to the famou
baron in 1836 he publish a natur histori of whale in which he
give what he call a pictur of the sperm whale befor show that
pictur to ani nantucket you had best provid for your summari
retreat from nantucket in a word frederick cuvier sperm whale is
not a sperm whale but a squash of cours he never had the benefit of
a whale voyag such men seldom have but whenc he deriv that
pictur who can tell perhap he got it as hi scientif predecessor
in the same field desmarest got on of hi authent abort that
is from a chines draw and what sort of live lad with the
pencil those chines ar mani queer cup and saucer inform us
as for the signpaint whale seen in the street hang over the
shop of oildeal what shall be said of them thei ar gener
richard iii whale with dromedari hump and veri savag
breakfast on three or four sailor tart that is whaleboat full of
marin their deform flounder in sea of blood and blue
paint
but these manifold mistak in depict the whale ar not so veri
surpris after all consid most of the scientif draw have
been taken from the strand fish and these ar about as correct as a
draw of a wreck ship with broken back would correctli repres
the nobl anim itself in all it undash pride of hull and spar
though eleph have stood for their fulllength the live
leviathan ha never yet fairli float himself for hi portrait the
live whale in hi full majesti and signific is onli to be seen
at sea in unfathom water and afloat the vast bulk of him is out
of sight like a launch lineofbattl ship and out of that element
it is a thing etern imposs for mortal man to hoist him bodili
into the air so as to preserv all hi mighti swell and undul
and not to speak of the highli presum differ of contour
between a young suck whale and a fullgrown platonian leviathan
yet even in the case of on of those young suck whale hoist to a
ship deck such is then the outlandish eellik limber vari
shape of him that hi precis express the devil himself could not
catch
but it mai be fanci that from the nake skeleton of the strand
whale accur hint mai be deriv touch hi true form not at
all for it is on of the more curiou thing about thi leviathan
that hi skeleton give veri littl idea of hi gener shape though
jeremi bentham skeleton which hang for candelabra in the librari of
on of hi executor correctli convei the idea of a burlybrow
utilitarian old gentleman with all jeremi other lead person
characterist yet noth of thi kind could be infer from ani
leviathan articul bone in fact as the great hunter sai the
mere skeleton of the whale bear the same relat to the fulli
invest and pad anim as the insect doe to the chrysali that so
roundingli envelop it thi peculiar is strikingli evinc in the
head as in some part of thi book will be incident shown it is
also veri curious displai in the side fin the bone of which
almost exactli answer to the bone of the human hand minu onli the
thumb thi fin ha four regular bonefing the index middl ring
and littl finger but all these ar perman lodg in their fleshi
cover as the human finger in an artifici cover howev
recklessli the whale mai sometim serv us said humor stubb on
dai he can never be truli said to handl us without mitten
for all these reason then ani wai you mai look at it you must need
conclud that the great leviathan is that on creatur in the world
which must remain unpaint to the last true on portrait mai hit the
mark much nearer than anoth but none can hit it with ani veri
consider degre of exact so there is no earthli wai of find
out precis what the whale realli look like and the onli mode in
which you can deriv even a toler idea of hi live contour is by
go a whale yourself but by so do you run no small risk of
be etern stove and sunk by him wherefor it seem to me you
had best not be too fastidi in your curios touch thi
leviathan
chapter lvi of the less erron pictur of whale and the true
pictur of whale scene
in connexion with the monstrou pictur of whale i am strongli
tempt here to enter upon those still more monstrou stori of them

beal draw of thi whale ar good except the middl figur in
the pictur of three whale in variou attitud cap hi second
chapter hi frontispiec boat attack sperm whale though no
doubt calcul to excit the civil sceptic of some parlor men is
admir correct and lifelik in it gener effect some of the
sperm whale draw in j ross brown ar pretti correct in contour
but thei ar wretchedli engrav that is not hi fault though
of the right whale the best outlin pictur ar in scoresbi but thei
ar drawn on too small a scale to convei a desir impress he ha
but on pictur of whale scene and thi is a sad defici
becaus it is by such pictur onli when at all well done that you
can deriv anyth like a truth idea of the live whale as seen by
hi live hunter
but taken for all in all by far the finest though in some detail
not the most correct present of whale and whale scene to be
anywher found ar two larg french engrav well execut and
taken from paint by on garneri respect thei repres
attack on the sperm and right whale in the first engrav a nobl
sperm whale is depict in full majesti of might just risen beneath
the boat from the profund of the ocean and bear high in the
air upon hi back the terrif wreck of the stoven plank the prow of
the boat is partial unbroken and is drawn just balanc upon the
monster spine and stand in that prow for that on singl
incomput flash of time you behold an oarsman half shroud by the
incens boil spout of the whale and in the act of leap as if
from a precipic the action of the whole thing is wonderfulli good and
true the halfempti linetub float on the whiten sea the wooden
pole of the spill harpoon obliqu bob in it the head of the
swim crew ar scatter about the whale in contrast express
of affright while in the black stormi distanc the ship is bear
down upon the scene seriou fault might be found with the anatom
detail of thi whale but let that pass sinc for the life of me i
could not draw so good a on
in the second engrav the boat is in the act of draw alongsid
the barnacl flank of a larg run right whale that roll hi
black weedi bulk in the sea like some mossi rockslid from the
patagonian cliff hi jet ar erect full and black like soot so
that from so abound a smoke in the chimnei you would think there
must be a brave supper cook in the great bowel below sea fowl ar
peck at the small crab shellfish and other sea candi and
maccaroni which the right whale sometim carri on hi pestil
back and all the while the thicklip leviathan is rush through
the deep leav ton of tumultu white curd in hi wake and
caus the slight boat to rock in the swell like a skiff caught nigh
the paddlewheel of an ocean steamer thu the foreground is all
rage commot but behind in admir artist contrast is the
glassi level of a sea becalm the droop unstarch sail of the
powerless ship and the inert mass of a dead whale a conquer
fortress with the flag of captur lazili hang from the whalepol
insert into hi spouthol
who garneri the painter is or wa i know not but my life for it he
wa either practic convers with hi subject or els
marvel tutor by some experienc whaleman the french ar the
lad for paint action go and gaze upon all the paint in europ
and where will you find such a galleri of live and breath
commot on canva as in that triumphal hall at versail where the

battl of franc where everi sword seem a flash of the northern
light and the success arm king and emperor dash by like a

the natur aptitud of the french for seiz the picturesqu of

finish sketch at all capabl of convei the real spirit of the
whale hunt for the most part the english and american whale
draughtsmen seem entir content with present the mechan
outlin of thing such as the vacant profil of the whale which so
far as picturesqu of effect is concern is about tantamount to
sketch the profil of a pyramid even scoresbi the justli renown
right whaleman after give us a stiff full length of the greenland

in addit to those fine engrav from garneri there ar two other
french engrav worthi of note by some on who subscrib himself
h durand on of them though not precis adapt to our present

even so often with him who for the first time behold thi speci

some old naturalist have maintain that all creatur of the land ar

vast pulpi mass furlong in length and breadth of a glanc
creamcolor lai float on the water innumer long arm radiat
from it centr and curl and twist like a nest of anaconda as
if blindli to clutch at ani hapless object within reach no percept

the rest as silent follow
whatev superstit the sperm whalemen in gener have connect
with the sight of thi object certain it is that a glimps of it
be so veri unusu that circumst ha gone far to invest it with
portent so rare is it beheld that though on and all of them
declar it to be the largest anim thing in the ocean yet veri few
of them have ani but the most vagu idea concern it true natur
and form notwithstand thei believ it to furnish to the sperm
whale hi onli food for though other speci of whale find their food
abov water and mai be seen by man in the act of feed the
spermaceti whale obtain hi whole food in unknown zone below the
surfac and onli by infer is it that ani on can tell of what
precis that food consist at time when close pursu he will
disgorg what ar suppos to be the detach arm of the squid some
of them thu exhibit exceed twenti and thirti feet in length thei
fanci that the monster to which these arm belong ordinarili cling
by them to the bed of the ocean and that the sperm whale unlik other
speci is suppli with teeth in order to attack and tear it
there seem some ground to imagin that the great kraken of bishop
pontoppodan mai ultim resolv itself into squid the manner in
which the bishop describ it as altern rise and sink with
some other particular he narrat in all thi the two correspond but
much abat is necessari with respect to the incred bulk he
assign it
by some naturalist who have vagu heard rumor of the mysteri
creatur here spoken of it is includ among the class of
cuttlefish to which inde in certain extern respect it would
seem to belong but onli as the anak of the tribe
chapter lx the line
with refer to the whale scene shortli to be describ as well as
for the better understand of all similar scene elsewher present
i have here to speak of the magic sometim horribl whalelin
the line origin us in the fisheri wa of the best hemp slightli
vapor with tar not impregn with it as in the case of ordinari
rope for while tar as ordinarili us make the hemp more pliabl
to the ropemak and also render the rope itself more conveni to
the sailor for common ship us yet not onli would the ordinari
quantiti too much stiffen the whalelin for the close coil to which
it must be subject but as most seamen ar begin to learn tar in
gener by no mean add to the rope durabl or strength howev
much it mai give it compact and gloss
of late year the manilla rope ha in the american fisheri almost
entir supersed hemp as a materi for whalelin for though not
so durabl as hemp it is stronger and far more soft and elast and
i will add sinc there is an sthetic in all thing is much more
handsom and becom to the boat than hemp hemp is a duski dark
fellow a sort of indian but manilla is as a goldenhair circassian
to behold
the whale line is onli two third of an inch in thick at first
sight you would not think it so strong as it realli is by experi
it on and fifti yarn will each suspend a weight of on hundr and
twenti pound so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearli equal
to three ton in length the common sperm whalelin measur
someth over two hundr fathom toward the stern of the boat it is
spiral coil awai in the tub not like the wormpip of a still
though but so as to form on round cheeseshap mass of dens
bed sheav or layer of concentr spiral without ani
hollow but the heart or minut vertic tube form at the axi of
the chees as the least tangl or kink in the coil would in
run out infal take somebodi arm leg or entir bodi off
the utmost precaut is us in stow the line in it tub some
harpoon will consum almost an entir morn in thi busi
carri the line high aloft and then reev it downward through a
block toward the tub so as in the act of coil to free it from all
possibl wrinkl and twist
in the english boat two tub ar us instead of on the same line
be continu coil in both tub there is some advantag in
thi becaus these twintub be so small thei fit more readili into
the boat and do not strain it so much wherea the american tub
nearli three feet in diamet and of proportion depth make a
rather bulki freight for a craft whose plank ar but on halfinch in
thick for the bottom of the whaleboat is like critic ic which
will bear up a consider distribut weight but not veri much of a
concentr on when the paint canva cover is clap on the
american linetub the boat look as if it were pull off with a
prodigi great weddingcak to present to the whale
both end of the line ar expos the lower end termin in an
eyesplic or loop come up from the bottom against the side of the
tub and hang over it edg complet disengag from everyth
thi arrang of the lower end is necessari on two account first
in order to facilit the fasten to it of an addit line from a
neighbor boat in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to
threaten to carri off the entir line origin attach to the
harpoon in these instanc the whale of cours is shift like a mug
of al as it were from the on boat to the other though the first
boat alwai hover at hand to assist it consort second thi
arrang is indispens for common safeti sake for were the
lower end of the line in ani wai attach to the boat and were the
whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a singl smoke
minut as he sometim doe he would not stop there for the doom
boat would infal be drag down after him into the profund of
the sea and in that case no towncrier would ever find her again
befor lower the boat for the chase the upper end of the line is
taken aft from the tub and pass round the loggerhead there is
again carri forward the entir length of the boat rest crosswis
upon the loom or handl of everi man oar so that it jog against hi
wrist in row and also pass between the men as thei altern
sit at the opposit gunwal to the lead chock or groov in the
extrem point prow of the boat where a wooden pin or skewer the size
of a common quill prevent it from slip out from the chock it
hang in a slight festoon over the bow and is then pass insid the
boat again and some ten or twenti fathom call boxlin be
coil upon the box in the bow it continu it wai to the gunwal
still a littl further aft and is then attach to the shortwarpth
rope which is immedi connect with the harpoon but previou to
that connexion the shortwarp goe through sundri mystif too
tediou to detail
thu the whalelin fold the whole boat in it complic coil
twist and writh around it in almost everi direct all the
oarsmen ar involv in it peril contort so that to the timid
ey of the landsman thei seem as indian juggler with the deadliest
snake sportiv festoon their limb nor can ani son of mortal

and while strain hi utmost at the oar bethink him that at ani
unknown instant the harpoon mai be dart and all these horribl

and brighter reparte you never heard over your mahogani than you

death with a halter around everi neck as you mai sai
perhap a veri littl thought will now enabl you to account for those
repeat whale disasterssom few of which ar casual chronicledof
thi man or that man be taken out of the boat by the line and lost
for when the line is dart out to be seat then in the boat is
like be seat in the midst of the manifold whizz of a
steamengin in full plai when everi fly beam and shaft and
wheel is graze you it is wors for you cannot sit motionless in
the heart of these peril becaus the boat is rock like a cradl
and you ar pitch on wai and the other without the slightest
warn and onli by a certain selfadjust buoyanc and
simultan of volit and action can you escap be made a
mazeppa of and run awai with where the allse sun himself could
never pierc you out
again as the profound calm which onli appar preced and
prophesi of the storm is perhap more aw than the storm itself
for inde the calm is but the wrapper and envelop of the storm and
contain it in itself as the seemingli harmless rifl hold the fatal
powder and the ball and the explos so the grace repos of the
line as it silent serpentin about the oarsmen befor be brought
into actual playthi is a thing which carri more of true terror than
ani other aspect of thi danger affair but why sai more all men
live envelop in whalelin all ar born with halter round their

that mortal realiz the silent subtl everpres peril of life
and if you be a philosoph though seat in the whaleboat you would
not at heart feel on whit more of terror than though seat befor

chapter lxii the dart
a word concern an incid in the last chapter
accord to the invari usag of the fisheri the whaleboat push
off from the ship with the headsman or whalekil as temporari
steersman and the harpoon or whalefasten pull the foremost
oar the on known as the harpooneeroar now it need a strong
nervou arm to strike the first iron into the fish for often in what
is call a long dart the heavi implement ha to be flung to the
distanc of twenti or thirti feet but howev prolong and exhaust
the chase the harpoon is expect to pull hi oar meanwhil to the
uttermost inde he is expect to set an exampl of superhuman
activ to the rest not onli by incred row but by repeat
loud and intrepid exclam and what it is to keep shout at the
top of on compass while all the other muscl ar strain and half
startedwhat that is none know but those who have tri it for on i
cannot bawl veri heartili and work veri recklessli at on and the same
time in thi strain bawl state then with hi back to the
fish all at onc the exhaust harpoon hear the excit
crystand up and give it to him he now ha to drop and secur hi
oar turn round on hi centr half wai seiz hi harpoon from the
crotch and with what littl strength mai remain he essai to pitch it
somehow into the whale no wonder take the whole fleet of whalemen
in a bodi that out of fifti fair chanc for a dart not five ar
success no wonder that so mani hapless harpoon ar madli curs
and disrat no wonder that some of them actual burst their
bloodvessel in the boat no wonder that some sperm whalemen ar
absent four year with four barrel no wonder that to mani ship
owner whale is but a lose concern for it is the harpoon that
make the voyag and if you take the breath out of hi bodi how can
you expect to find it there when most want
again if the dart be success then at the second critic instant
that is when the whale start to run the boathead and harpoon
likewis start to run fore and aft to the immin jeopardi of
themselv and everi on els it is then thei chang place and the
headsman the chief offic of the littl craft take hi proper
station in the bow of the boat
now i care not who maintain the contrari but all thi is both
foolish and unnecessari the headsman should stai in the bow from
first to last he should both dart the harpoon and the lanc and no
row whatev should be expect of him except under circumst
obviou to ani fisherman i know that thi would sometim involv a
slight loss of speed in the chase but long experi in variou
whalemen of more than on nation ha convinc me that in the vast
major of failur in the fisheri it ha not by ani mean been so
much the speed of the whale as the befor describ exhaust of the
harpoon that ha caus them
to insur the greatest effici in the dart the harpoon of thi
world must start to their feet from out of idl and not from out
of toil
chapter lxiii the crotch

the crotch allud to on a previou page deserv independ mention
it is a notch stick of a peculiar form some two feet in length
which is perpendicularli insert into the starboard gunwal near the

the harpoon whose other nake barb end slopingli project from the
prow therebi the weapon is instantli at hand to it hurler who
snatch it up as readili from it rest as a backwoodsman swing hi
rifl from the wall it is customari to have two harpoon repos in
the crotch respect call the first and second iron
but these two harpoon each by it own cord ar both connect with
the line the object be thi to dart them both if possibl on
instantli after the other into the same whale so that if in the
come drag on should draw out the other mai still retain a hold it
is a doubl of the chanc but it veri often happen that ow to
the instantan violent convuls run of the whale upon
receiv the first iron it becom imposs for the harpoon
howev lightninglik in hi movement to pitch the second iron into
him nevertheless as the second iron is alreadi connect with the
line and the line is run henc that weapon must at all event
be anticipatingli toss out of the boat somehow and somewher els
the most terribl jeopardi would involv all hand tumbl into the
water it accordingli is in such case the spare coil of box line
mention in a preced chapter make thi feat in most instanc
prudent practic but thi critic act is not alwai unattend
with the saddest and most fatal casualti
furthermor you must know that when the second iron is thrown
overboard it thenceforth becom a dangl sharpedg terror

went hi wai into the cabin and did not come forward again until
morn
though in overse the pursuit of thi whale captain ahab had
evinc hi customari activ to call it so yet now that the
creatur wa dead some vagu dissatisfact or impati or
despair seem work in him as if the sight of that dead bodi
remind him that mobi dick wa yet to be slain and though a thousand
other whale were brought to hi ship all that would not on jot

from the sound on the pequod deck that all hand were prepar to

dark of the night which obscur the spar and rig aloft the
twoship and whale seem yoke togeth like coloss bullock
whereof on reclin while the other remain standing14
14 a littl item mai as well be relat here the strongest and most
reliabl hold which the ship ha upon the whale when moor alongsid
is by the fluke or tail and as from it greater densiti that part is
rel heavier than ani other except the sidefin it
flexibl even in death caus it to sink low beneath the surfac
so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat in order to
put the chain round it but thi difficulti is ingeni overcom a
small strong line is prepar with a wooden float at it outer end
and a weight in it middl while the other end is secur to the
ship by adroit manag the wooden float is made to rise on the
other side of the mass so that now have girdl the whale the
chain is readili made to follow suit and be slip along the

the few sleeper below in their bunk were often startl by the sharp

sleeper heart peer over the side you could just see them as
befor you heard them wallow in the sullen black water and
turn over on their back as thei scoop out huge globular piec of

a part of the univers problem of all thing the mark thei thu leav

chapter lxv the whale as a dish
that mortal man should feed upon the creatur that feed hi lamp and
like stubb eat him by hi own light as you mai sai thi seem so
outlandish a thing that on must need go a littl into the histori and
philosophi of it
it is upon record that three centuri ago the tongu of the right
whale wa esteem a great delicaci in franc and command larg
price there also that in henri viiith time a certain cook of the
court obtain a handsom reward for invent an admir sauc to be
eaten with barbacu porpois which you rememb ar a speci of
whale porpois inde ar to thi dai consid fine eat the
meat is made into ball about the size of billiard ball and be
well season and spice might be taken for turtlebal or veal ball
the old monk of dunfermlin were veri fond of them thei had a great
porpois grant from the crown
the fact is that among hi hunter at least the whale would by all
hand be consid a nobl dish were there not so much of him but
when you come to sit down befor a meatpi nearli on hundr feet
long it take awai your appetit onli the most unprejud of men
like stubb nowadai partak of cook whale but the esquimaux ar
not so fastidi we all know how thei live upon whale and have rare
old vintag of prime old train oil zogranda on of their most famou
doctor recommend strip of blubber for infant as be exceedingli
juici and nourish and thi remind me that certain englishmen who
long ago were accident left in greenland by a whale vesselthat
these men actual live for sever month on the mouldi scrap of
whale which had been left ashor after try out the blubber among
the dutch whalemen these scrap ar call fritter which inde
thei greatli resembl be brown and crisp and smell someth
like old amsterdam housew doughnut or olycook when fresh
thei have such an eatabl look that the most selfdeni stranger can
hardli keep hi hand off
but what further depreci the whale as a civil dish is hi
exceed rich he is the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be
delic good look at hi hump which would be as fine eat as the
buffalo which is esteem a rare dish were it not such a solid
pyramid of fat but the spermaceti itself how bland and creami that
is like the transpar halfjelli white meat of a cocoanut in the
third month of it growth yet far too rich to suppli a substitut for
butter nevertheless mani whalemen have a method of absorb it into
some other substanc and then partak of it in the long try watch
of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their
shipbiscuit into the huge oilpot and let them fry there awhil mani
a good supper have i thu made
in the case of a small sperm whale the brain ar account a fine
dish the casket of the skull is broken into with an ax and the two
plump whitish lobe be withdrawn precis resembl two larg
pud thei ar then mix with flour and cook into a most
delect mess in flavor somewhat resembl calv head which is
quit a dish among some epicur and everi on know that some young
buck among the epicur by continu dine upon calv brain by
and by get to have a littl brain of their own so as to be abl to
tell a calf head from their own head which inde requir
uncommon discrimin and that is the reason why a young buck with
an intellig look calf head befor him is somehow on of the
saddest sight you can see the head look a sort of reproachfulli at
him with an et tu brute express
it is not perhap entir becaus the whale is so excess
unctuou that landsmen seem to regard the eat of him with
abhorr that appear to result in some wai from the consider
befor mention i e that a man should eat a newli murder thing of
the sea and eat it too by it own light but no doubt the first man
that ever murder an ox wa regard as a murder perhap he wa
hung and if he had been put on hi trial by oxen he certainli would
have been and he certainli deserv it if ani murder doe go to the
meatmarket of a saturdai night and see the crowd of live bipe
stare up at the long row of dead quadrup doe not that sight
take a tooth out of the cannib jaw cannib who is not a
cannib i tell you it will be more toler for the feje that
salt down a lean missionari in hi cellar against a come famin it
will be more toler for that provid feje i sai in the dai of
judgment than for thee civil and enlighten gourmand who
nailest gees to the ground and feastest on their bloat liver in thy
patdefoiegra
but stubb he eat the whale by it own light doe he and that is
ad insult to injuri is it look at your knifehandl there my
civil and enlighten gourmand dine off that roast beef what is
that handl made ofwhat but the bone of the brother of the veri ox

chapter lxvi the shark massacr
when in the southern fisheri a captur sperm whale after long and

that until that time anchorwatch shall be kept that is two and

to see that all goe well
but sometim especi upon the line in the pacif thi plan will
not answer at all becaus such incalcul host of shark gather
round the moor carcas that were he left so for six hour sai on a

larg abound their wondrou vorac can be at time consider
diminish by vigor stir them up with sharp whalingspad a

unaccustom to such sight to have look over her side that night
would have almost thought the whole round sea wa on huge chees and

chapter lxviii the blanket
i have given no small attent to that not unvex subject the skin
of the whale i have had controversi about it with experienc
whalemen afloat and learn naturalist ashor my origin opinion
remain unchang but it is onli an opinion
the question is what and where is the skin of the whale alreadi you
know what hi blubber is that blubber is someth of the consist
of firm closegrain beef but tougher more elast and compact and
rang from eight or ten to twelv and fifteen inch in thick
now howev preposter it mai at first seem to talk of ani
creatur skin as be of that sort of consist and thick yet
in point of fact these ar no argument against such a presumpt
becaus you cannot rais ani other dens envelop layer from the
whale bodi but that same blubber and the outermost envelop layer
of ani anim if reason dens what can that be but the skin
true from the unmar dead bodi of the whale you mai scrape off with
your hand an infinit thin transpar substanc somewhat
resembl the thinnest shred of isinglass onli it is almost as
flexibl and soft as satin that is previou to be dri when it
not onli contract and thicken but becom rather hard and brittl i
have sever such dri bit which i us for mark in my whalebook
it is transpar as i said befor and be laid upon the print
page i have sometim pleas myself with fanci it exert a
magnifi influenc at ani rate it is pleasant to read about whale
through their own spectacl as you mai sai but what i am drive at
here is thi that same infinit thin isinglass substanc which i
admit invest the entir bodi of the whale is not so much to be
regard as the skin of the creatur as the skin of the skin so to
speak for it were simpli ridicul to sai that the proper skin of
the tremend whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a
newborn child but no more of thi
assum the blubber to be the skin of the whale then when thi skin
as in the case of a veri larg sperm whale will yield the bulk of on
hundr barrel of oil and when it is consid that in quantiti
or rather weight that oil in it express state is onli three
fourth and not the entir substanc of the coat some idea mai henc
be had of the enorm of that anim mass a mere part of whose
mere integu yield such a lake of liquid as that reckon ten
barrel to the ton you have ten ton for the net weight of onli three
quarter of the stuff of the whale skin
in life the visibl surfac of the sperm whale is not the least among
the mani marvel he present almost invari it is all over
obliqu cross and recross with numberless straight mark in
thick arrai someth like those in the finest italian line
engrav but these mark do not seem to be impress upon the
isinglass substanc abov mention but seem to be seen through it as
if thei were engrav upon the bodi itself nor is thi all in some
instanc to the quick observ ey those linear mark as in a
verit engrav but afford the ground for far other delin
these ar hieroglyph that is if you call those mysteri cypher
on the wall of pyramid hieroglyph then that is the proper word to
us in the present connexion by my retent memori of the
hieroglyph upon on sperm whale in particular i wa much struck
with a plate repres the old indian charact chisel on the
famou hieroglyph palisad on the bank of the upper mississippi
like those mystic rock too the mysticmark whale remain
undecipher thi allus to the indian rock remind me of anoth
thing besid all the other phenomena which the exterior of the sperm
whale present he not seldom displai the back and more especi
hi flank effac in great part of the regular linear appear by
reason of numer rude scratch altogeth of an irregular random
aspect i should sai that those new england rock on the seacoast
which agassiz imagin to bear the mark of violent scrape contact
with vast float icebergsi should sai that those rock must not a
littl resembl the sperm whale in thi particular it also seem to me
that such scratch in the whale ar probabl made by hostil contact
with other whale for i have most remark them in the larg
fullgrown bull of the speci
a word or two more concern thi matter of the skin or blubber of the
whale it ha alreadi been said that it is stript from him in long
piec call blanketpiec like most seaterm thi on is veri
happi and signific for the whale is inde wrapt up in hi blubber
as in a real blanket or counterpan or still better an indian poncho
slipt over hi head and skirt hi extrem it is by reason of
thi cosi blanket of hi bodi that the whale is enabl to keep
himself comfort in all weather in all sea time and tide
what would becom of a greenland whale sai in those shudder ici
sea of the north if unsuppli with hi cosi surtout true other
fish ar found exceedingli brisk in those hyperborean water but
these be it observ ar your coldblood lungless fish whose veri
belli ar refriger creatur that warm themselv under the

fire wherea like man the whale ha lung and warm blood freez hi
blood and he di how wonder is it thenexcept after
explanationthat thi great monster to whom corpor warmth is as
indispens as it is to man how wonder that he should be found at
home immers to hi lip for life in those arctic water where when
seamen fall overboard thei ar sometim found month afterward
perpendicularli frozen into the heart of field of ic as a fly is
found glu in amber but more surpris is it to know as ha been
prove by experi that the blood of a polar whale is warmer than
that of a borneo negro in summer
it doe seem to me that herein we see the rare virtu of a strong
individu vital and the rare virtu of thick wall and the rare
virtu of interior spacious oh man admir and model thyself
after the whale do thou too remain warm among ic do thou too
live in thi world without be of it be cool at the equat keep
thy blood fluid at the pole like the great dome of st peter and
like the great whale retain o man in all season a temperatur of

chapter lxxi the jeroboam stori
hand in hand ship and breez blew on but the breez came faster than
the ship and soon the pequod began to rock
by and by through the glass the stranger boat and man masthead
prove her a whaleship but as she wa so far to windward and
shoot by appar make a passag to some other ground the
pequod could not hope to reach her so the signal wa set to see what
respons would be made
here be it said that like the vessel of militari marin the ship
of the american whale fleet have each a privat signal all which
signal be collect in a book with the name of the respect
vessel attach everi captain is provid with it therebi the whale
command ar enabl to recognis each other upon the ocean even at
consider distanc and with no small facil
the pequod signal wa at last respond to by the stranger set
her own which prove the ship to be the jeroboam of nantucket
squar her yard she bore down rang abeam under the pequod lee
and lower a boat it soon drew nigh but as the sideladd wa
be rig by starbuck order to accommod the visit captain
the stranger in question wave hi hand from hi boat stern in token
of that proceed be entir unnecessari it turn out that the
jeroboam had a malign epidem on board and that mayhew her
captain wa fear of infect the pequod compani for though
himself and boat crew remain untaint and though hi ship wa
half a rifleshot off and an incorrupt sea and air roll and
flow between yet conscienti adher to the timid quarantin
of the land he peremptorili refus to come into direct contact with
the pequod
but thi did by no mean prevent all commun preserv an
interv of some few yard between itself and the ship the jeroboam
boat by the occasion us of it oar contriv to keep parallel to
the pequod as she heavili forg through the sea for by thi time it
blew veri fresh with her maintopsail aback though inde at time
by the sudden onset of a larg roll wave the boat would be push
some wai ahead but would be soon skilfulli brought to her proper
bear again subject to thi and other the like interrupt now
and then a convers wa sustain between the two parti but at
interv not without still anoth interrupt of a veri differ
sort
pull an oar in the jeroboam boat wa a man of a singular
appear even in that wild whale life where individu
notabl make up all total he wa a small short youngish
man sprinkl all over hi face with freckl and wear redund
yellow hair a longskirt cabalisticallycut coat of a fade walnut

so soon as thi figur had been first descri stubb had

townho compani told us of stubb here allud to a strang stori
told of the jeroboam and a certain man among her crew some time
previou when the pequod spoke the townho accord to thi account
and what wa subsequ learn it seem that the scaramouch in
question had gain a wonder ascend over almost everybodi in the
jeroboam hi stori wa thi
he had been origin nurtur among the crazi societi of neskyeuna
shaker where he had been a great prophet in their crack secret

where with that cun peculiar to crazi he assum a steadi
common sens exterior and offer himself as a greenhand candid for
the jeroboam whale voyag thei engag him but straightwai upon
the ship get out of sight of land hi insan broke out in a
freshet he announc himself as the archangel gabriel and command
the captain to jump overboard he publish hi manifesto wherebi he
set himself forth as the deliver of the isl of the sea and
vicargener of all oceanica the unflinch earnest with which
he declar these thingsth dark dare plai of hi sleepless
excit imagin and all the preternatur terror of real
delirium unit to invest thi gabriel in the mind of the major of
the ignor crew with an atmospher of sacred moreov thei
were afraid of him as such a man howev wa not of much practic
us in the ship especi as he refus to work except when he
pleas the incredul captain would fain have been rid of him but
appris that that individu intent wa to land him in the first
conveni port the archangel forthwith open all hi seal and
vialsdevot the ship and all hand to uncondit perdit in
case thi intent wa carri out so strongli did he work upon hi
discipl among the crew that at last in a bodi thei went to the
captain and told him if gabriel wa sent from the ship not a man of
them would remain he wa therefor forc to relinquish hi plan nor
would thei permit gabriel to be ani wai maltreat sai or do what he
would so that it came to pass that gabriel had the complet freedom of
the ship the consequ of all thi wa that the archangel care
littl or noth for the captain and mate and sinc the epidem had
broken out he carri a higher hand than ever declar that the
plagu as he call it wa at hi sole command nor should it be
stai but accord to hi good pleasur the sailor mostli poor
devil cring and some of them fawn befor him in obedi to
hi instruct sometim render him person homag as to a god
such thing mai seem incred but howev wondrou thei ar true
nor is the histori of fanat half so strike in respect to the
measureless selfdecept of the fanat himself as hi measureless
power of deceiv and bedevil so mani other but it is time to
return to the pequod
i fear not thy epidem man said ahab from the bulwark to captain
mayhew who stood in the boat stern come on board
but now gabriel start to hi feet
think think of the fever yellow and biliou bewar of the horribl
plagu
gabriel gabriel cri captain mayhew thou must either but that
instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead and it seeth
drown all speech
hast thou seen the white whale demand ahab when the boat drift
back
think think of thy whaleboat stoven and sunk bewar of the
horribl tail
i tell thee again gabriel that but again the boat tore ahead as if
drag by fiend noth wa said for some moment while a
success of riotou wave roll by which by on of those occasion
capric of the sea were tumbl not heav it meantim the
hoist sperm whale head jog about veri violent and gabriel wa
seen ey it with rather more apprehens than hi archangel
natur seem to warrant
when thi interlud wa over captain mayhew began a dark stori
concern mobi dick not howev without frequent interrupt from
gabriel whenev hi name wa mention and the crazi sea that seem
leagu with him
it seem that the jeroboam had not long left home when upon speak
a whaleship her peopl were reliabl appris of the exist of
mobi dick and the havoc he had made greedili suck in thi
intellig gabriel solemnli warn the captain against attack the
white whale in case the monster should be seen in hi gibber
insan pronounc the white whale to be no less a be than the
shaker god incarn the shaker receiv the bibl but when some
year or two afterward mobi dick wa fairli sight from the
masthead macei the chief mate burn with ardor to encount him
and the captain himself be not unwil to let him have the
opportun despit all the archangel denunci and
forewarn macei succeed in persuad five men to man hi boat
with them he push off and after much weari pull and mani
peril unsuccess onset he at last succeed in get on iron
fast meantim gabriel ascend to the mainroy masthead wa
toss on arm in frantic gestur and hurl forth propheci of
speedi doom to the sacrilegi assail of hi divin now while
macei the mate wa stand up in hi boat bow and with all the
reckless energi of hi tribe wa vent hi wild exclam upon the
whale and essai to get a fair chanc for hi pois lanc lo a
broad white shadow rose from the sea by it quick fan motion
temporarili take the breath out of the bodi of the oarsmen next
instant the luckless mate so full of furiou life wa smitten bodili
into the air and make a long arc in hi descent fell into the sea
at the distanc of about fifti yard not a chip of the boat wa
harm nor a hair of ani oarsman head but the mate for ever sank
it is well to parenthes here that of the fatal accid in the
spermwhal fisheri thi kind is perhap almost as frequent as ani
sometim noth is injur but the man who is thu annihil
often the boat bow is knock off or the thighboard in which the
headsman stand is torn from it place and accompani the bodi but
strangest of all is the circumst that in more instanc than on
when the bodi ha been recov not a singl mark of violenc is
discern the man be stark dead
the whole calam with the fall form of macei wa plainli
descri from the ship rais a pierc shriekth vial the vial
gabriel call off the terrorstricken crew from the further hunt of
the whale thi terribl event cloth the archangel with ad

specif foreannounc it instead of onli make a gener
propheci which ani on might have done and so have chanc to hit on
of mani mark in the wide margin allow he becam a nameless terror
to the ship
mayhew have conclud hi narrat ahab put such question to him
that the stranger captain could not forbear inquir whether he
intend to hunt the white whale if opportun should offer to which
ahab answereday straightwai then gabriel onc more start to
hi feet glare upon the old man and vehement exclaim with
downward point fingerthink think of the blasphemerdead and down
therebewar of the blasphem end
ahab stolidli turn asid then said to mayhew captain i have just
bethought me of my letterbag there is a letter for on of thy

canst not read it cri ahab give it me man ay ay it but a

receiv it and take the fatal missiv from starbuck hand he
caught it in the slit of the pole and reach it over toward the
boat but as he did so the oarsmen expectantli desist from row
the boat drift a littl toward the ship stern so that as if by
magic the letter suddenli rang along with gabriel eager hand he
clutch it in an instant seiz the boatknif and impal the
letter on it sent it thu load back into the ship it fell at ahab

chapter lxxiii stubb and flask kill a right whale and then have a
talk over him
it must be born in mind that all thi time we have a sperm whale
prodigi head hang to the pequod side but we must let it
continu hang there a while till we can get a chanc to attend to
it for the present other matter press and the best we can do now for
the head is to prai heaven the tackl mai hold
now dure the past night and forenoon the pequod had gradual
drift into a sea which by it occasion patch of yellow brit
gave unusu token of the vicin of right whale a speci of the
leviathan that but few suppos to be at thi particular time lurk
anywher near and though all hand commonli disdain the captur of
those inferior creatur and though the pequod wa not commiss to
cruis for them at all and though she had pass number of them near
the crozett without lower a boat yet now that a sperm whale had
been brought alongsid and behead to the surpris of all the
announc wa made that a right whale should be captur that dai
if opportun offer
nor wa thi long want tall spout were seen to leeward and two
boat stubb and flask were detach in pursuit pull further
and further awai thei at last becam almost invis to the men at
the masthead but suddenli in the distanc thei saw a great heap of
tumultu white water and soon after new came from aloft that on or
both the boat must be fast an interv pass and the boat were in
plain sight in the act of be drag right toward the ship by the
tow whale so close did the monster come to the hull that at first
it seem as if he meant it malic but suddenli go down in a
maelstrom within three rod of the plank he wholli disappear from
view as if dive under the keel cut cut wa the cry from the
ship to the boat which for on instant seem on the point of be
brought with a deadli dash against the vessel side but have plenti
of line yet in the tub and the whale not sound veri rapidli thei
paid out abund of rope and at the same time pull with all their
might so as to get ahead of the ship for a few minut the struggl
wa intens critic for while thei still slack out the tighten
line in on direct and still pli their oar in anoth the
contend strain threaten to take them under but it wa onli a few
feet advanc thei sought to gain and thei stuck to it till thei did
gain it when instantli a swift tremor wa felt run like lightn
along the keel as the strain line scrape beneath the ship
suddenli rose to view under her bow snap and quiver and so
fling off it drip that the drop fell like bit of broken
glass on the water while the whale beyond also rose to sight and onc
more the boat were free to fly but the fag whale abat hi speed
and blindli alter hi cours went round the stern of the ship
tow the two boat after him so that thei perform a complet
circuit
meantim thei haul more and more upon their line till close
flank him on both side stubb answer flask with lanc for lanc
and thu round and round the pequod the battl went while the
multitud of shark that had befor swum round the sperm whale bodi
rush to the fresh blood that wa spill thirstili drink at everi
new gash as the eager israelit did at the new burst fountain
that pour from the smitten rock
at last hi spout grew thick and with a fright roll and vomit he
turn upon hi back a corps
while the two headsmen were engag in make fast cord to hi fluke
and in other wai get the mass in readi for tow some
convers ensu between them
i wonder what the old man want with thi lump of foul lard said
stubb not without some disgust at the thought of have to do with so
ignobl a leviathan
want with it said flask coil some spare line in the boat bow
did you never hear that the ship which but onc ha a sperm whale
head hoist on her starboard side and at the same time a right
whale on the larboard did you never hear stubb that that ship can
never afterward capsiz
why not
i dont know but i heard that gambog ghost of a fedallah sai so
and he seem to know all about ship charm but i sometim think
hell charm the ship to no good at last i dont half like that chap
stubb did you ever notic how that tusk of hi is a sort of carv
into a snake head stubb
sink him i never look at him at all but if ever i get a chanc of a
dark night and he stand hard by the bulwark and no on by look
down there flaskpoint into the sea with a peculiar motion of both
handsay will i flask i take that fedallah to be the devil in
disguis do you believ that cock and bull stori about hi have been
stow awai on board ship he the devil i sai the reason why you
dont see hi tail is becaus he tuck it up out of sight he carri
it coil awai in hi pocket i guess blast him now that i think of
it he alwai want oakum to stuff into the toe of hi boot
he sleep in hi boot dont he he hasnt got ani hammock but iv
seen him lai of night in a coil of rig
no doubt and it becaus of hi curs tail he coil it down do ye
see in the ey of the rig
what the old man have so much to do with him for
strike up a swap or a bargain i suppos
bargainabout what
why do ye see the old man is hard bent after that white whale and
the devil there is try to come round him and get him to swap awai
hi silver watch or hi soul or someth of that sort and then
hell surrend mobi dick
pooh stubb you ar skylark how can fedallah do that
i dont know flask but the devil is a curiou chap and a wick
on i tell ye why thei sai as how he went a saunter into the old
flagship onc switch hi tail about devilish easi and
gentlemanlik and inquir if the old governor wa at home well he
wa at home and ask the devil what he want the devil switch
hi hoof up and sai i want john what for sai the old
governor what busi is that of your sai the devil get
madi want to us him take him sai the governorand by the
lord flask if the devil didnt give john the asiat cholera befor
he got through with him ill eat thi whale in on mouth but look
sharpaint you all readi there well then pull ahead and let get
the whale alongsid
i think i rememb some such stori as you were tell said flask
when at last the two boat were slowli advanc with their burden
toward the ship but i cant rememb where
three spaniard adventur of those three bloodymind soldado
did ye read it there flask i guess ye did
no never saw such a book heard of it though but now tell me
stubb do you suppos that that devil you wa speak of just now wa
the same you sai is now on board the pequod
am i the same man that help kill thi whale doesnt the devil live
for ever who ever heard that the devil wa dead did you ever see ani
parson a wear mourn for the devil and if the devil ha a
latchkei to get into the admir cabin dont you suppos he can
crawl into a porthol tell me that mr flask
how old do you suppos fedallah is stubb
do you see that mainmast there point to the ship well that
the figur on now take all the hoop in the pequod hold and string
em along in a row with that mast for ought do you see well that
wouldnt begin to be fedallah ag nor all the cooper in creation
couldnt show hoop enough to make ought enough
but see here stubb i thought you a littl boast just now that you
meant to give fedallah a seatoss if you got a good chanc now if
he so old as all those hoop of your come to and if he is go to
live for ever what good will it do to pitch him overboardtel me
that
give him a good duck anyhow
but hed crawl back
duck him again and keep duck him
suppos he should take it into hi head to duck you thoughy and
drown youwhat then
i should like to see him try it id give him such a pair of black
ey that he wouldnt dare to show hi face in the admir cabin
again for a long while let alon down in the orlop there where he
live and hereabout on the upper deck where he sneak so much damn
the devil flask do you suppos im afraid of the devil who afraid
of him except the old governor who daresnt catch him and put him in
doubledarbi as he deserv but let him go about kidnap
peopl ay and sign a bond with him that all the peopl the devil
kidnap hed roast for him there a governor
do you suppos fedallah want to kidnap captain ahab
do i suppos it youll know it befor long flask but i am go now
to keep a sharp lookout on him and if i see anyth veri suspici
go on ill just take him by the nape of hi neck and saylook
here beelzebub you dont do it and if he make ani fuss by the lord
ill make a grab into hi pocket for hi tail take it to the capstan
and give him such a wrench and heav that hi tail will come
short off at the stumpdo you see and then i rather guess when he
find himself dock in that queer fashion hell sneak off without the
poor satisfact of feel hi tail between hi leg
and what will you do with the tail stubb
do with it sell it for an ox whip when we get homewhat els
now do you mean what you sai and have been sai all along stubb
mean or not mean here we ar at the ship
the boat were here hail to tow the whale on the larboard side
where fluke chain and other necessari were alreadi prepar for
secur him
didnt i tell you so said flask ye youll soon see thi right
whale head hoist up opposit that parmacetti
in good time flask sai prove true as befor the pequod steepli
lean over toward the sperm whale head now by the counterpois of
both head she regain her even keel though sore strain you mai
well believ so when on on side you hoist in lock head you go
over that wai but now on the other side hoist in kant and you come
back again but in veri poor plight thu some mind for ever keep
trim boat oh ye foolish throw all these thunderhead overboard
and then you will float light and right
in dispos of the bodi of a right whale when brought alongsid the
ship the same preliminari proceed commonli take place as in the
case of a sperm whale onli in the latter instanc the head is cut
off whole but in the former the lip and tongu ar separ remov
and hoist on deck with all the well known black bone attach to
what is call the crownpiec but noth like thi in the present
case had been done the carcas of both whale had drop astern
and the headladen ship not a littl resembl a mule carri a pair
of overburden pannier
meantim fedallah wa calmli ey the right whale head and ever
and anon glanc from the deep wrinkl there to the line in hi own
hand and ahab chanc so to stand that the parse occupi hi
shadow while if the parse shadow wa there at all it seem onli
to blend with and lengthen ahab as the crew toil on laplandish
specul were bandi among them concern all these pass

chapter lxxiv the sperm whale headcontrast view
here now ar two great whale lai their head togeth let us
join them and lai togeth our own
of the grand order of folio leviathan the sperm whale and the right
whale ar by far the most noteworthi thei ar the onli whale
regularli hunt by man to the nantucket thei present the two
extrem of all the known varieti of the whale as the extern
differ between them is mainli observ in their head and as a
head of each is thi moment hang from the pequod side and as we
mai freeli go from on to the other by mere step across the
deckwher i should like to know will you obtain a better chanc to
studi practic cetolog than here
in the first place you ar struck by the gener contrast between
these head both ar massiv enough in all conscienc but there is a
certain mathemat symmetri in the sperm whale which the right
whale sadli lack there is more charact in the sperm whale head
as you behold it you involuntarili yield the immens superior to
him in point of pervad digniti in the present instanc too thi
digniti is heighten by the pepper and salt color of hi head at the
summit give token of advanc ag and larg experi in short he
is what the fishermen technic call a greyhead whale
let us now note what is least dissimilar in these headsnam the two
most import organ the ey and the ear far back on the side of the
head and low down near the angl of either whale jaw if you
narrowli search you will at last see a lashless ey which you would
fanci to be a young colt ey so out of all proport is it to the
magnitud of the head
now from thi peculiar sidewai posit of the whale ey it is
plain that he can never see an object which is exactli ahead no more
than he can on exactli astern in a word the posit of the whale
ey correspond to that of a man ear and you mai fanci for
yourself how it would fare with you did you sidewai survei object
through your ear you would find that you could onli command some
thirti degre of vision in advanc of the straight sidelin of sight
and about thirti more behind it if your bitterest foe were walk
straight toward you with dagger uplift in broad dai you would not
be abl to see him ani more than if he were steal upon you from
behind in a word you would have two back so to speak but at the
same time also two front side front for what is it that make
the front of a manwhat inde but hi ey
moreov while in most other anim that i can now think of the ey
ar so plant as impercept to blend their visual power so as to
produc on pictur and not two to the brain the peculiar posit of
the whale ey effectu divid as thei ar by mani cubic feet of
solid head which tower between them like a great mountain separ
two lake in vallei thi of cours must wholli separ the
impress which each independ organ impart the whale therefor
must see on distinct pictur on thi side and anoth distinct
pictur on that side while all between must be profound dark and
nothing to him man mai in effect be said to look out on the
world from a sentrybox with two join sash for hi window but with
the whale these two sash ar separ insert make two
distinct window but sadli impair the view thi peculiar of the
whale ey is a thing alwai to be born in mind in the fisheri and
to be rememb by the reader in some subsequ scene
a curiou and most puzzl question might be start concern thi
visual matter as touch the leviathan but i must be content with a
hint so long as a man ey ar open in the light the act of see
is involuntari that is he cannot then help mechan see
whatev object ar befor him nevertheless ani on experi
will teach him that though he can take in an undiscrimin sweep of
thing at on glanc it is quit imposs for him attent and
complet to examin ani two thingshowev larg or howev smallat
on and the same instant of time never mind if thei lie side by side
and touch each other but if you now come to separ these two
object and surround each by a circl of profound dark then in
order to see on of them in such a manner as to bring your mind to
bear on it the other will be utterli exclud from your contemporari
conscious how is it then with the whale true both hi ey in
themselv must simultan act but is hi brain so much more
comprehens combin and subtl than man that he can at the
same moment of time attent examin two distinct prospect on on
on side of him and the other in an exactli opposit direct if he
can then is it as marvel a thing in him as if a man were abl
simultan to go through the demonstr of two distinct
problem in euclid nor strictli investig is there ani
incongru in thi comparison
it mai be but an idl whim but it ha alwai seem to me that the
extraordinari vacil of movement displai by some whale when
beset by three or four boat the timid and liabil to queer
fright so common to such whale i think that all thi indirectli
proce from the helpless perplex of volit in which their
divid and diametr opposit power of vision must involv them
but the ear of the whale is full as curiou as the ey if you ar an
entir stranger to their race you might hunt over these two head for
hour and never discov that organ the ear ha no extern leaf
whatev and into the hole itself you can hardli insert a quill so
wondrous minut is it it is lodg a littl behind the ey with
respect to their ear thi import differ is to be observ
between the sperm whale and the right while the ear of the former ha
an extern open that of the latter is entir and evenli cover
over with a membran so as to be quit impercept from without
is it not curiou that so vast a be as the whale should see the
world through so small an ey and hear the thunder through an ear
which is smaller than a hare but if hi ey were broad as the len
of herschel great telescop and hi ear capaci as the porch of
cathedr would that make him ani longer of sight or sharper of
hear not at allwhi then do you try to enlarg your mind
subtil it
let us now with whatev lever and steamengin we have at hand cant
over the sperm whale head so that it mai lie bottom up then
ascend by a ladder to the summit have a peep down the mouth and
were it not that the bodi is now complet separ from it with a
lantern we might descend into the great kentucki mammoth cave of hi
stomach but let us hold on here by thi tooth and look about us where
we ar what a realli beauti and chastelook mouth from floor to
ceil line or rather paper with a glisten white membran
glossi as bridal satin
but come out now and look at thi portent lower jaw which seem
like the long narrow lid of an immens snuffbox with a hing at on
end instead of on side if you pry it up so as to get it overhead
and expos it row of teeth it seem a terrif portculli and such
ala it prove to mani a poor wight in the fisheri upon whom these
spike fall with impal forc but far more terribl is it to behold
when fathom down in the sea you see some sulki whale float there
suspend with hi prodigi jaw some fifteen feet long hang
straight down at rightangl with hi bodi for all the world like a
ship jibboom thi whale is not dead he is onli dispirit out of
sort perhap hypochondriac and so supin that the hing of hi
jaw have relax leav him there in that ungainli sort of plight a
reproach to all hi tribe who must no doubt imprec lockjaw upon
him
in most case thi lower jawb easili unhing by a practis
artisti disengag and hoist on deck for the purpos of extract
the ivori teeth and furnish a suppli of that hard white whalebon
with which the fishermen fashion all sort of curiou articl
includ cane umbrellastock and handl to ridingwhip
with a long weari hoist the jaw is drag on board as if it were an
anchor and when the proper time comessom few dai after the other
workqueequeg daggoo and tashtego be all accomplish dentist
ar set to draw teeth with a keen cuttingspad queequeg lanc
the gum then the jaw is lash down to ringbolt and a tackl be
rig from aloft thei drag out these teeth as michigan oxen drag
stump of old oak out of wild woodland there ar gener
fortytwo teeth in all in old whale much worn down but undecai
nor fill after our artifici fashion the jaw is afterward sawn
into slab and pile awai like joist for build hous
chapter lxxv the right whale headcontrast view
cross the deck let us now have a good long look at the right
whale head
as in gener shape the nobl sperm whale head mai be compar to a
roman warchariot especi in front where it is so broadli
round so at a broad view the right whale head bear a rather
ineleg resembl to a gigant galliotto shoe two hundr
year ago an old dutch voyag liken it shape to that of a
shoemak last and in thi same last or shoe that old woman of the
nurseri tale with the swarm brood might veri comfort be
lodg she and all her progeni
but as you come nearer to thi great head it begin to assum differ
aspect accord to your point of view if you stand on it summit
and look at these two fshape spouthol you would take the whole
head for an enorm bassviol and these spiracl the apertur in
it soundingboard then again if you fix your ey upon thi strang
crest comblik incrust on the top of the massthi green
barnacl thing which the greenland call the crown and the
southern fisher the bonnet of the right whale fix your ey
sole on thi you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak
with a bird nest in it crotch at ani rate when you watch those
live crab that nestl here on thi bonnet such an idea will be almost
sure to occur to you unless inde your fanci ha been fix by the
technic term crown also bestow upon it in which case you will
take great interest in think how thi mighti monster is actual a
diadem king of the sea whose green crown ha been put togeth for
him in thi marvel manner but if thi whale be a king he is a
veri sulki look fellow to grace a diadem look at that hang lower
lip what a huge sulk and pout is there a sulk and pout by
carpent measur about twenti feet long and five feet deep a
sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallon of oil and more
a great piti now that thi unfortun whale should be harelip
the fissur is about a foot across probabl the mother dure an
import interv wa sail down the peruvian coast when
earthquak caus the beach to gape over thi lip as over a slipperi
threshold we now slide into the mouth upon my word were i at
mackinaw i should take thi to be the insid of an indian wigwam good
lord is thi the road that jonah went the roof is about twelv feet
high and run to a pretti sharp angl as if there were a regular
ridgepol there while these rib arch hairi side present us
with those wondrou half vertic scimetarshap slat of
whalebon sai three hundr on a side which depend from the upper
part of the head or crown bone form those venetian blind which have
elsewher been cursorili mention the edg of these bone ar
fring with hairi fibr through which the right whale strain the
water and in whose intricaci he retain the small fish when
openmouth he goe through the sea of brit in feed time in the
central blind of bone as thei stand in their natur order there ar
certain curiou mark curv hollow and ridg wherebi some
whalemen calcul the creatur ag as the ag of an oak by it
circular ring though the certainti of thi criterion is far from
demonstr yet it ha the savor of analog probabl at ani
rate if we yield to it we must grant a far greater ag to the right
whale than at first glanc will seem reason
in old time there seem to have prevail the most curiou fanci
concern these blind on voyag in purcha call them the wondrou
whisker insid of the whale mouth17 anoth hog bristl
a third old gentleman in hackluyt us the follow eleg languag
there ar about two hundr and fifti fin grow on each side of hi
upper chop which arch over hi tongu on each side of hi mouth
17 thi remind us that the right whale realli ha a sort of
whisker or rather a moustach consist of a few scatter white
hair on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw sometim
these tuft impart a rather brigandish express to hi otherwis
solemn counten
as everi on know these same hog bristl fin whisker
blind or whatev you pleas furnish to the ladi their busk and
other stiffen contriv but in thi particular the demand ha
long been on the declin it wa in queen ann time that the bone wa
in it glori the farthingal be then all the fashion and as those
ancient dame move about gaili though in the jaw of the whale as
you mai sai even so in a shower with the like thoughtless do we
nowadai fly under the same jaw for protect the umbrella be a
tent spread over the same bone
but now forget all about blind and whisker for a moment and
stand in the right whale mouth look around you afresh see all
these colonnad of bone so method rang about would you not
think you were insid the great haarlem organ and gaze upon it
thousand pipe for a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest
turkeyth tongu which is glu as it were to the floor of the
mouth it is veri fat and tender and apt to tear in piec in hoist
it on deck thi particular tongu now befor us at a pass glanc i
should sai it wa a sixbarrel that is it will yield you about that
amount of oil
er thi you must have plainli seen the truth of what i start
withthat the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entir
differ head to sum up then in the right whale there is no
great well of sperm no ivori teeth at all no long slender mandibl
of a lower jaw like the sperm whale nor in the sperm whale ar
there ani of those blind of bone no huge lower lip and scarc
anyth of a tongu again the right whale ha two extern
spouthol the sperm whale onli on
look your last now on these vener hood head while thei yet
lie togeth for on will soon sink unrecord in the sea the other
will not be veri long in follow
can you catch the express of the sperm whale there it is the same
he di with onli some of the longer wrinkl in the forehead seem now
fade awai i think hi broad brow to be full of a prairielik
placid born of a specul indiffer as to death but mark the
other head express see that amaz lower lip press by
accid against the vessel side so as firmli to embrac the jaw
doe not thi whole head seem to speak of an enorm practic
resolut in face death thi right whale i take to have been a
stoic the sperm whale a platonian who might have taken up spinoza in
hi latter year
chapter lxxvi the batteringram
er quit for the nonc the sperm whale head i would have you
as a sensibl physiologist simplyparticularli remark it front
aspect in all it compact collected i would have you
investig it now with the sole view of form to yourself some
unexagger intellig estim of whatev batteringram power mai
be lodg there here is a vital point for you must either
satisfactorili settl thi matter with yourself or for ever remain an
infidel as to on of the most appal but not the less true event
perhap anywher to be found in all record histori
you observ that in the ordinari swim posit of the sperm whale
the front of hi head present an almost wholli vertic plane to the
water you observ that the lower part of that front slope
consider backward so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long
socket which receiv the boomlik lower jaw you observ that the
mouth is entir under the head much in the same wai inde as
though your own mouth were entir under your chin moreov you
observ that the whale ha no extern nose and that what nose he
hashi spout holei on the top of hi head you observ that hi ey
and ear ar at the side of hi head nearli on third of hi entir
length from the front wherefor you must now have perceiv that the
front of the sperm whale head is a dead blind wall without a singl
organ or tender promin of ani sort whatsoev furthermor you ar
now to consid that onli in the extrem lower backward slope part
of the front of the head is there the slightest vestig of bone and
not till you get near twenti feet from the forehead do you come to the
full cranial develop so that thi whole enorm boneless mass is
as on wad final though as will soon be reveal it content
partli compris the most delic oil yet you ar now to be appris
of the natur of the substanc which so impregn invest all that
appar effeminaci in some previou place i have describ to you how
the blubber wrap the bodi of the whale as the rind wrap an orang
just so with the head but with thi differ about the head thi
envelop though not so thick is of a boneless tough inestim
by ani man who ha not handl it the severest point harpoon the
sharpest lanc dart by the strongest human arm impot rebound
from it it is as though the forehead of the sperm whale were pave
with hors hoof i do not think that ani sensat lurk in it
bethink yourself also of anoth thing when two larg load indiamen
chanc to crowd and crush toward each other in the dock what do the
sailor do thei do not suspend between them at the point of come
contact ani mere hard substanc like iron or wood no thei hold

chapter lxxvii the great heidelburgh tun
now come the bale of the case but to comprehend it aright you must
know someth of the curiou intern structur of the thing oper
upon
regard the sperm whale head as a solid oblong you mai on an
inclin plane sidewai divid it into two quoins18 whereof the
lower is the boni structur form the cranium and jaw and the
upper an unctuou mass wholli free from bone it broad forward end
form the expand vertic appar forehead of the whale at the
middl of the forehead horizont subdivid thi upper quoin and
then you have two almost equal part which befor were natur
divid by an intern wall of a thick tendin substanc
18 quoin is not a euclidean term it belong to the pure nautic
mathemat i know not that it ha been defin befor a quoin is a
solid which differ from a wedg in have it sharp end form by the
steep inclin of on side instead of the mutual taper of both
side
the lower subdivid part call the junk is on immens honeycomb of
oil form by the cross and recross into ten thousand
infiltr cell of tough elast white fibr throughout it whole
extent the upper part known as the case mai be regard as the great
heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale and as that famou great tierc is
mystic carv in front so the whale vast plait forehead form
innumer strang devic for the emblemat adorn of hi
wondrou tun moreov as that of heidelburgh wa alwai replenish
with the most excel of the wine of the rhenish vallei so the tun
of the whale contain by far the most preciou of all hi oili
vintag name the highlypr spermaceti in it absolut pure
limpid and odorifer state nor is thi preciou substanc found
unalloi in ani other part of the creatur though in life it remain
perfectli fluid yet upon exposur to the air after death it soon
begin to concret send forth beauti crystallin shoot as when
the first thin delic ic is just form in water a larg whale

unavoid circumst consider of it is spill leak and
dribbl awai or is otherwis irrevoc lost in the ticklish

i know not with what fine and costli materi the heidelburgh tun wa
coat within but in superl rich that coat could not
possibl have compar with the silken pearlcolor membran like the
line of a fine peliss form the inner surfac of the sperm whale
case
it will have been seen that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale
embrac the entir length of the entir top of the head and sincea
ha been elsewher set forthth head embrac on third of the whole
length of the creatur then set that length down at eighti feet
for a good size whale you have more than twentysix feet for the
depth of the tun when it is lengthwis hoist up and down against a
ship side
as in decapit the whale the oper instrument is brought
close to the spot where an entranc is subsequ forc into the
spermaceti magazin he ha therefor to be uncommonli heed lest
a careless untim stroke should invad the sanctuari and wastingli

he proce veri heedfulli like a treasurehunt in some old hous
sound the wall to find where the gold is mason in by the time
thi cautiou search is over a stout ironbound bucket precis like
a wellbucket ha been attach to on end of the whip while the

three alert hand these last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the
indian to whom anoth person ha reach up a veri long pole
insert thi pole into the bucket tashtego downward guid the
bucket into the tun till it entir disappear then give the word
to the seamen at the whip up come the bucket again all bubbl like
a dairymaid pail of new milk carefulli lower from it height the

the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more toward the
end tashtego ha to ram hi long pole harder and harder and deeper
and deeper into the tun until some twenti feet of the pole have gone
down
now the peopl of the pequod had been bale some time in thi wai
sever tub had been fill with the fragrant sperm when all at onc
a queer accid happen whether it wa that tashtego that wild
indian wa so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment hi
onehand hold on the great cabl tackl suspend the head or
whether the place where he stood wa so treacher and oozi or
whether the evil on himself would have it to fall out so without
state hi particular reason how it wa exactli there is no tell
now but on a sudden as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came
suckingli upmi god poor tashtegolik the twin reciproc bucket
in a verit well drop headforemost down into thi great tun of
heidelburgh and with a horribl oili gurgl went clean out of

man overboard cri daggoo who amid the gener constern first
came to hi sens swing the bucket thi wai and put on foot
into it so as the better to secur hi slipperi handhold on the whip
itself the hoister ran him high up to the top of the head almost
befor tashtego could have reach it interior bottom meantim there
wa a terribl tumult look over the side thei saw the befor
lifeless head throb and heav just below the surfac of the sea
as if that moment seiz with some moment idea wherea it wa onli
the poor indian unconsci reveal by those struggl the peril
depth to which he had sunk
at thi instant while daggoo on the summit of the head wa clear
the whipwhich had somehow got foul of the great cut tacklesa
sharp crack nois wa heard and to the unspeak horror of all
on of the two enorm hook suspend the head tore out and with a
vast vibrat the enorm mass sidewai swung till the drunk ship
reel and shook as if smitten by an iceberg the on remain hook
upon which the entir strain now depend seem everi instant to be

motion of the head
come down come down yell the seamen to daggoo but with on hand
hold on to the heavi tackl so that if the head should drop he
would still remain suspend the negro have clear the foul line
ram down the bucket into the now collaps well mean that the

in heaven name man cri stubb ar you ram home a cartridg

almost in the same instant with a thunderboom the enorm mass
drop into the sea like niagara tablerock into the whirlpool the
suddenli reliev hull roll awai from it to far down her glitter
copper and all caught their breath as half swingingnow over the
sailor head and now over the waterdaggoo through a thick mist of

buriedal tashtego wa sink utterli down to the bottom of the
sea but hardli had the blind vapor clear awai when a nake

hover over the bulwark the next a loud splash announc that my
brave queequeg had dive to the rescu on pack rush wa made to the
side and everi ey count everi rippl as moment follow moment
and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen some hand
now jump into a boat alongsid and push a littl off from the
ship
ha ha cri daggoo all at onc from hi now quiet swing perch
overhead and look further off from the side we saw an arm thrust
upright from the blue wave a sight strang to see as an arm thrust
forth from the grass over a grave
both bothit is bothcri daggoo again with a joy shout and
soon after queequeg wa seen boldli strike out with on hand and
with the other clutch the long hair of the indian drawn into the
wait boat thei were quickli brought to the deck but tashtego wa
long in come to and queequeg did not look veri brisk
now how had thi nobl rescu been accomplish why dive after the
slowli descend head queequeg with hi keen sword had made side
lung near it bottom so as to scuttl a larg hole there then
drop hi sword had thrust hi long arm far inward and upward
and so haul out our poor tash by the head he aver that upon
first thrust in for him a leg wa present but well know that
that wa not as it ought to be and might occas great troubleh
had thrust back the leg and by a dexter heav and toss had wrought
a somerset upon the indian so that with the next trial he came forth
in the good old wayhead foremost as for the great head itself that
wa do as well as could be expect
and thu through the courag and great skill in obstetr of

i know that thi queer adventur of the gayhead will be sure to
seem incred to some landsmen though thei themselv mai have
either seen or heard of some on fall into a cistern ashor an

chapter lxxix the prair
to scan the line of hi face or feel the bump on the head of thi
leviathan thi is a thing which no physiognomist or phrenologist ha
as yet undertaken such an enterpris would seem almost as hope as
for lavat to have scrutin the wrinkl on the rock of gibraltar
or for gall to have mount a ladder and manipul the dome of the
pantheon still in that famou work of hi lavat not onli treat of
the variou face of men but also attent studi the face of
hors bird serpent and fish and dwell in detail upon the
modif of express discern therein nor have gall and hi
discipl spurzheim fail to throw out some hint touch the
phrenolog characterist of other be than man therefor
though i am but ill qualifi for a pioneer in the applic of
these two semisci to the whale i will do my endeavor i try all
thing i achiev what i can
physiognom regard the sperm whale is an anomal creatur he
ha no proper nose and sinc the nose is the central and most
conspicu of the featur and sinc it perhap most modifi and
final control their combin express henc it would seem that
it entir absenc as an extern appendag must veri larg affect
the counten of the whale for as in landscap garden a spire
cupola monument or tower of some sort is deem almost indispens
to the complet of the scene so no face can be physiognom in
keep without the elev openwork belfri of the nose dash the
nose from phidiass marbl jove and what a sorri remaind
nevertheless leviathan is of so mighti a magnitud all hi
proport ar so state that the same defici which in the
sculptur jove were hideou in him is no blemish at all nai it is
an ad grandeur a nose to the whale would have been impertin as
on your physiognom voyag you sail round hi vast head in your
jollyboat your nobl concept of him ar never insult by the
reflect that he ha a nose to be pull a pestil conceit which
so often will insist upon obtrud even when behold the mightiest
royal beadl on hi throne
in some particular perhap the most impos physiognom view to
be had of the sperm whale is that of the full front of hi head thi
aspect is sublim
in thought a fine human brow is like the east when troubl with the
morn in the repos of the pastur the curl brow of the bull ha
a touch of the grand in it push heavi cannon up mountain defil
the eleph brow is majest human or anim the mystic brow is
as that great golden seal affix by the german emperor to their
decre it signifiesgod done thi dai by my hand but in most
creatur nai in man himself veri often the brow is but a mere strip
of alpin land ly along the snow line few ar the forehead which
like shakespear or melancthon rise so high and descend so low
that the ey themselv seem clear etern tideless mountain lake
and all abov them in the forehead wrinkl you seem to track the
antler thought descend there to drink as the highland hunter
track the snow print of the deer but in the great sperm whale thi
high and mighti godlik digniti inher in the brow is so immens
amplifi that gaze on it in that full front view you feel the
deiti and the dread power more forcibl than in behold ani other
object in live natur for you see no on point precis not on
distinct featur is reveal no nose ey ear or mouth no face
he ha none proper noth but that on broad firmament of a
forehead pleat with riddl dumbl lower with the doom of boat
and ship and men nor in profil doe thi wondrou brow diminish
though that wai view it grandeur doe not domin upon you so in
profil you plainli perceiv that horizont semicrescent
depress in the forehead middl which in man is lavat mark
of geniu
but how geniu in the sperm whale ha the sperm whale ever written a
book spoken a speech no hi great geniu is declar in hi do
noth particular to prove it it is moreov declar in hi
pyramid silenc and thi remind me that had the great sperm whale
been known to the young orient world he would have been deifi by
their childmagian thought thei deifi the crocodil of the nile
becaus the crocodil is tongueless and the sperm whale ha no tongu
or as least it is so exceedingli small as to be incap of
protrus if hereaft ani highli cultur poetic nation shall
lure back to their birthright the merri maydai god of old and
livingli enthron them again in the now egotist sky in the now
unhaunt hill then be sure exalt to jove high seat the great
sperm whale shall lord it
champollion deciph the wrinkl granit hieroglyph but there is
no champollion to deciph the egypt of everi man and everi be
face physiognomi like everi other human scienc is but a pass
fabl if then sir william jone who read in thirti languag could
not read the simplest peasant face in it profound and more subtl
mean how mai unlett ishmael hope to read the aw chalde of
the sperm whale brow i but put that brow befor you read if it you
can
chapter lxxx the nut
if the sperm whale be physiognom a sphinx to the phrenologist
hi brain seem that geometr circl which it is imposs to
squar
in the fullgrown creatur the skull will measur at least twenti feet
in length unhing the lower jaw and the side view of thi skull is as
the side view of a moder inclin plane rest throughout on a
level base but in lifea we have elsewher seenthi inclin plane
is angularli fill up and almost squar by the enorm
superincumb mass of the junk and sperm at the high end the skull
form a crater to bed that part of the mass while under the long floor
of thi craterin anoth caviti seldom exceed ten inch in length
and as mani in depthrepos the mere hand of thi monster brain
the brain is at least twenti feet from hi appar forehead in life
it is hidden awai behind it vast outwork like the innermost citadel
within the amplifi fortif of quebec so like a choic casket
is it secret in him that i have known some whalemen who peremptorili
deni that the sperm whale ha ani other brain than that palpabl
semblanc of on form by the cubicyard of hi sperm magazin ly
in strang fold cours and convolut to their apprehens it
seem more in keep with the idea of hi gener might to regard that
mystic part of him as the seat of hi intellig
it is plain then that phrenolog the head of thi leviathan in
the creatur live intact state is an entir delus as for hi
true brain you can then see no indic of it nor feel ani the
whale like all thing that ar mighti wear a fals brow to the
common world
if you unload hi skull of it spermi heap and then take a rear view
of it rear end which is the high end you will be struck by it
resembl to the human skull beheld in the same situat and from
the same point of view inde place thi revers skull scale down
to the human magnitud among a plate of men skull and you would
involuntarili confound it with them and remark the depress on
on part of it summit in phrenolog phrase you would saythi man
had no selfesteem and no vener and by those negat
consid along with the affirm fact of hi prodigi bulk and
power you can best form to yourself the truest though not the most
exhilar concept of what the most exalt potenc is
but if from the compar dimens of the whale proper brain you
deem it incap of be adequ chart then i have anoth idea
for you if you attent regard almost ani quadrup spine you
will be struck with the resembl of it vertebr to a strung
necklac of dwarf skull all bear rudiment resembl to the
skull proper it is a german conceit that the vertebr ar absolut
undevelop skull but the curiou extern resembl i take it the
german were not the first men to perceiv a foreign friend onc
point it out to me in the skeleton of a foe he had slain and with
the vertebr of which he wa inlai in a sort of bassorelievo the
beak prow of hi cano now i consid that the phrenologist have
omit an import thing in not push their investig from the
cerebellum through the spinal canal for i believ that much of a man
charact will be found betoken in hi backbon i would rather feel
your spine than your skull whoever you ar a thin joist of a spine
never yet upheld a full and nobl soul i rejoic in my spine as in
the firm audaci staff of that flag which i fling half out to the
world
appli thi spinal branch of phrenolog to the sperm whale hi cranial
caviti is continu with the first neckvertebra and in that vertebra
the bottom of the spinal canal will measur ten inch across be
eight in height and of a triangular figur with the base downward as
it pass through the remain vertebr the canal taper in size but
for a consider distanc remain of larg capac now of cours
thi canal is fill with much the same strang fibrou substanceth
spinal corda the brain and directli commun with the brain and
what is still more for mani feet after emerg from the brain
caviti the spinal cord remain of an undecreas girth almost equal
to that of the brain under all these circumst would it be
unreason to survei and map out the whale spine phrenolog
for view in thi light the wonder compar small of hi
brain proper is more than compens by the wonder compar
magnitud of hi spinal cord
but leav thi hint to oper as it mai with the phrenologist i
would mere assum the spinal theori for a moment in refer to the
sperm whale hump thi august hump if i mistak not rise over on
of the larger vertebr and is therefor in some sort the outer
convex mould of it from it rel situat then i should call
thi high hump the organ of firm or indomit in the sperm
whale and that the great monster is indomit you will yet have
reason to know
chapter lxxxi the pequod meet the virgin

derick de deer master of bremen
at on time the greatest whale peopl in the world the dutch and
german ar now among the least but here and there at veri wide

their flag in the pacif
for some reason the jungfrau seem quit eager to pai her respect
while yet some distanc from the pequod she round to and drop a

soon evinc hi complet ignor of the white whale immedi

without paus to put hi oilcan and lampfeed aboard he slew
round hi boat and made after the leviathan lampfeed
now the game have risen to leeward he and the other three german
boat that soon follow him had consider the start of the
pequod keel there were eight whale an averag pod awar of their
danger thei were go all abreast with great speed straight befor
the wind rub their flank as close as so mani span of hors in

a great wide parchment upon the sea
full in thi rapid wake and mani fathom in the rear swam a huge
hump old bull which by hi compar slow progress as well as
by the unusu yellowish incrust overgrow him seem
afflict with the jaundic or some other infirm whether thi
whale belong to the pod in advanc seem question for it is
not customari for such vener leviathan to be at all social
nevertheless he stuck to their wake though inde their back water
must have retard him becaus the whitebon or swell at hi broad

the best for it is but reason to presum that the longer the

ow to the enorm surfac of himin a full grown sperm whale

we all know what an astonish atmospher weight we ourselv stand

bodi would at onc sink to the bottom
it so chanc that almost upon first cut into him with the spade
the entir length of a corrod harpoon wa found imbed in hi

stump of harpoon ar frequent found in the dead bodi of captur
whale with the flesh perfectli heal around them and no promin

been some other unknown reason in the present case fulli to account for
the ulcer allud to but still more curiou wa the fact of a

what other marvel might have been rummag out of thi monstrou

howev starbuck who had the order of affair hung on to it to
the last hung on to it so resolut inde that when at length the
ship would have been capsiz if still persist in lock arm with
the bodi then when the command wa given to break clear from it such
wa the immov strain upon the timberhead to which the
flukechain and cabl were fasten that it wa imposs to cast

so low had the whale now settl that the submerg end could not be
at all approach while everi moment whole ton of ponderos seem

hold on hold on wont ye cri stubb to the bodi dont be in

now thi occasion inevit sink of the recent kill sperm
whale is a veri curiou thing nor ha ani fisherman yet adequ
account for it usual the dead sperm whale float with great
buoyanc with it side or belli consider elev abov the
surfac if the onli whale that thu sank were old meagr and
brokenheart creatur their pad of lard diminish and all their
bone heavi and rheumat then you might with some reason assert that
thi sink is caus by an uncommon specif graviti in the fish so
sink consequ upon thi absenc of buoyant matter in him but it
is not so for young whale in the highest health and swell with
nobl aspir prematur cut off in the warm flush and mai of
life with all their pant lard about them even these brawni
buoyant hero do sometim sink
be it said howev that the sperm whale is far less liabl to thi
accid than ani other speci where on of that sort go down twenti
right whale do thi differ in the speci is no doubt imput
in no small degre to the greater quantiti of bone in the right whale
hi venetian blind alon sometim weigh more than a ton from thi
incumbr the sperm whale is wholli free but there ar instanc
where after the laps of mani hour or sever dai the sunken whale
again rise more buoyant than in life but the reason of thi is
obviou gase ar gener in him he swell to a prodigi
magnitud becom a sort of anim balloon a lineofbattl ship
could hardli keep him under then in the shore whale on sound
among the bai of new zealand when a right whale give token of
sink thei fasten buoi to him with plenti of rope so that when
the bodi ha gone down thei know where to look for it when it shall
have ascend again
it wa not long after the sink of the bodi that a cry wa heard from
the pequod masthead announc that the jungfrau wa again
lower her boat though the onli spout in sight wa that of a
finback belong to the speci of uncaptur whale becaus of
it incred power of swim nevertheless the finback spout is
so similar to the sperm whale that by unskil fishermen it is
often mistaken for it and consequ derick and all hi host were
now in valiant chase of thi unnear brute the virgin crowd all
sail made after her four young keel and thu thei all disappear
far to leeward still in bold hope chase
oh mani ar the finback and mani ar the derick my friend
chapter lxxxii the honor and glori of whale
there ar some enterpris in which a care disorderli is the
true method
the more i dive into thi matter of whale and push my research up
to the veri springhead of it so much the more am i impress with it
great honor and antiqu and especi when i find so mani
great demigod and hero prophet of all sort who on wai or other
have shed distinct upon it i am transport with the reflect
that i myself belong though but subordin to so emblazon a
fratern
the gallant perseu a son of jupit wa the first whaleman and to
the etern honor of our call be it said that the first whale
attack by our brotherhood wa not kill with ani sordid intent
those were the knightli dai of our profess when we onli bore arm
to succor the distress and not to fill men lampfeed everi on
know the fine stori of perseu and andromeda how the love
andromeda the daughter of a king wa ti to a rock on the seacoast
and as leviathan wa in the veri act of carri her off perseu the
princ of whalemen intrepidli advanc harpoon the monster and
deliv and marri the maid it wa an admir artist exploit
rare achiev by the best harpoon of the present dai inasmuch as
thi leviathan wa slain at the veri first dart and let no man doubt
thi arkit stori for in the ancient joppa now jaffa on the syrian
coast in on of the pagan templ there stood for mani ag the vast
skeleton of a whale which the citi legend and all the inhabit
assert to be the ident bone of the monster that perseu slew
when the roman took joppa the same skeleton wa carri to itali in
triumph what seem most singular and suggest import in thi
stori is thi it wa from joppa that jonah set sail
akin to the adventur of perseu and andromedainde by some suppos
to be indirectli deriv from iti that famou stori of st georg and
the dragon which dragon i maintain to have been a whale for in mani
old chronicl whale and dragon ar strang jumbl togeth and
often stand for each other thou art as a lion of the water and as a
dragon of the sea saith ezekiel herebi plainli mean a whale in
truth some version of the bibl us that word itself besid it
would much subtract from the glori of the exploit had st georg but
encount a crawl reptil of the land instead of do battl
with the great monster of the deep ani man mai kill a snake but onli
a perseu a st georg a coffin have the heart in them to march
boldli up to a whale
let not the modern paint of thi scene mislead us for though the
creatur encount by that valiant whaleman of old is vagu
repres of a griffinlik shape and though the battl is depict
on land and the saint on horseback yet consid the great ignor
of those time when the true form of the whale wa unknown to artist
and consid that as in perseu case st georg whale might have
crawl up out of the sea on the beach and consid that the anim
ridden by st georg might have been onli a larg seal or seahors
bear all thi in mind it will not appear altogeth incompat
with the sacr legend and the ancientest draught of the scene to
hold thi socal dragon no other than the great leviathan himself
in fact place befor the strict and pierc truth thi whole stori
will fare like that fish flesh and fowl idol of the philistin
dagon by name who be plant befor the ark of israel hi hors
head and both the palm of hi hand fell off from him and onli the
stump or fishi part of him remain thu then on of our own nobl
stamp even a whaleman is the tutelari guardian of england and by
good right we harpoon of nantucket should be enrol in the most
nobl order of st georg and therefor let not the knight of that
honor compani none of whom i ventur to sai have ever had to do
with a whale like their great patron let them never ey a nantucket
with disdain sinc even in our woollen frock and tar trowser we
ar much better entitl to st georg decor than thei
whether to admit hercul among us or not concern thi i long
remain dubiou for though accord to the greek mytholog that
antiqu crockett and kit carsonthat brawni doer of rejoic good
deed wa swallow down and thrown up by a whale still whether that
strictli make a whaleman of him that might be moot it nowher
appear that he ever actual harpoon hi fish unless inde from
the insid nevertheless he mai be deem a sort of involuntari
whaleman at ani rate the whale caught him if he did not the whale i
claim him for on of our clan
but by the best contradictori author thi grecian stori of
hercul and the whale is consid to be deriv from the still more
ancient hebrew stori of jonah and the whale and vice ver certainli
thei ar veri similar if i claim the demigod then why not the
prophet
nor do hero saint demigod and prophet alon compris the whole
roll of our order our grand master is still to be name for like
royal king of old time we find the headwat of our fratern in
noth short of the great god themselv that wondrou orient
stori is now to be rehears from the shaster which give us the dread
vishnoo on of the three person in the godhead of the hindoo give
us thi divin vishnoo himself for our lordvishnoo who by the first
of hi ten earthli incarn ha for ever set apart and sanctifi
the whale when brahma or the god of god saith the shaster resolv

befor begin the creation and which therefor must have contain

chapter lxxxiii jonah histor regard
refer wa made to the histor stori of jonah and the whale in
the preced chapter now some nantucket rather distrust thi
histor stori of jonah and the whale but then there were some
sceptic greek and roman who stand out from the orthodox pagan
of their time equal doubt the stori of hercul and the whale
and arion and the dolphin and yet their doubt those tradit did
not make those tradit on whit the less fact for all that
on old sagharbor whaleman chief reason for question the hebrew
stori wa thish had on of those quaint oldfashion bibl
embellish with curiou unscientif plate on of which repres
jonah whale with two spout in hi heada peculiar onli true with
respect to a speci of the leviathan the right whale and the
varieti of that order concern which the fishermen have thi
sai a penni roll would choke him hi swallow is so veri small
but to thi bishop jebb anticip answer is readi it is not
necessari hint the bishop that we consid jonah as tomb in the
whale belli but as temporarili lodg in some part of hi mouth and
thi seem reason enough in the good bishop for truli the right
whale mouth would accommod a coupl of whist tabl and
comfort seat all the player possibl too jonah might have
ensconc himself in a hollow tooth but on second thought the right
whale is toothless
anoth reason which sagharbor he went by that name urg for hi
want of faith in thi matter of the prophet wa someth obscur in
refer to hi incarcer bodi and the whale gastric juic but
thi object likewis fall to the ground becaus a german exegetist
suppos that jonah must have taken refug in the float bodi of a
dead whaleeven as the french soldier in the russian campaign turn
their dead hors into tent and crawl into them besid it ha
been divin by other continent comment that when jonah wa
thrown overboard from the joppa ship he straightwai effect hi
escap to anoth vessel near by some vessel with a whale for a
figurehead and i would add possibl call the whale as some
craft ar nowadai christen the shark the gull the eagl nor
have there been want learn exegetist who have opin that the
whale mention in the book of jonah mere meant a lifepreserveran
inflat bag of windwhich the endang prophet swam to and so wa
save from a wateri doom poor sagharbor therefor seem worst all
round but he had still anoth reason for hi want of faith it wa
thi if i rememb right jonah wa swallow by the whale in the
mediterranean sea and after three dai he wa vomit up somewher
within three dai journei of nineveh a citi on the tigri veri much
more than three dai journei across from the nearest point of the
mediterranean coast how is that
but wa there no other wai for the whale to land the prophet within
that short distanc of nineveh ye he might have carri him round by
the wai of the cape of good hope but not to speak of the passag
through the whole length of the mediterranean and anoth passag up
the persian gulf and red sea such a supposit would involv the
complet circumnavig of all africa in three dai not to speak of
the tigri water near the site of nineveh be too shallow for ani
whale to swim in besid thi idea of jonah weather the cape of
good hope at so earli a dai would wrest the honor of the discoveri of
that great headland from bartholomew diaz it reput discover and
so make modern histori a liar
but all these foolish argument of old sagharbor onli evinc hi
foolish pride of reasona thing still more reprehens in him see
that he had but littl learn except what he had pick up from the
sun and the sea i sai it onli show hi foolish impiou pride and
abomin devilish rebellion against the reverend clergi for by a
portugues cathol priest thi veri idea of jonah go to nineveh
via the cape of good hope wa advanc as a signal magnif of the

twelv feet in length the staff is much slighter than that of the

haul back to the hand after dart
but befor go further it is import to mention here that though
the harpoon mai be pitchpol in the same wai with the lanc yet it is
seldom done and when done is still less frequent success on
account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as
compar with the lanc which in effect becom seriou drawback as a

chapter lxxxv the fountain
that for six thousand yearsand no on know how mani million of ag
beforeth great whale should have been spout all over the sea and
sprinkl and mistifi the garden of the deep as with so mani
sprinkl or mistifi pot and that for some centuri back
thousand of hunter should have been close by the fountain of the
whale watch these sprinkl and spoutingsthat all thi should
be and yet that down to thi bless minut fifteen and a quarter
minut past on oclock pm of thi sixteenth dai of decemb ad
1851 it should still remain a problem whether these spout ar
after all realli water or noth but vaporthi is sure a
noteworthi thing
let us then look at thi matter along with some interest item
conting everi on know that by the peculiar cun of their
gill the finni tribe in gener breath the air which at all time
is combin with the element in which thei swim henc a her or a
cod might live a centuri and never onc rais it head abov the
surfac but ow to hi mark intern structur which give him
regular lung like a human be the whale can onli live by
inhal the disengag air in the open atmospher wherefor the
necess for hi period visit to the upper world but he cannot
in ani degre breath through hi mouth for in hi ordinari attitud
the sperm whale mouth is buri at least eight feet beneath the
surfac and what is still more hi windpip ha no connexion with hi
mouth no he breath through hi spiracl alon and thi is on the
top of hi head
if i sai that in ani creatur breath is onli a function
indispens to vital inasmuch as it withdraw from the air a
certain element which be subsequ brought into contact with the
blood impart to the blood it vivifi principl i do not think i
shall err though i mai possibl us some superflu scientif word
assum it and it follow that if all the blood in a man could be
aerat with on breath he might then seal up hi nostril and not
fetch anoth for a consider time that is to sai he would then
live without breath anomal as it mai seem thi is precis the
case with the whale who systemat live by interv hi full
hour and more when at the bottom without draw a singl breath or
so much as in ani wai inhal a particl of air for rememb he ha
no gill how is thi between hi rib and on each side of hi spine
he is suppli with a remark involv cretan labyrinth of
vermicellilik vessel which vessel when he quit the surfac ar
complet distend with oxygen blood so that for an hour or
more a thousand fathom in the sea he carri a surplu stock of
vital in him just as the camel cross the waterless desert
carri a surplu suppli of drink for futur us in it four
supplementari stomach the anatom fact of thi labyrinth is
indisput and that the supposit found upon it is reason
and true seem the more cogent to me when i consid the otherwis
inexplic obstinaci of that leviathan in have hi spout out
as the fishermen phrase it thi is what i mean if unmolest upon
rise to the surfac the sperm whale will continu there for a period
of time exactli uniform with all hi other unmolest rise sai he
stai eleven minut and jet seventi time that is respir seventi
breath then whenev he rise again he will be sure to have hi
seventi breath over again to a minut now if after he fetch a few
breath you alarm him so that he sound he will be alwai dodg up
again to make good hi regular allow of air and not till those
seventi breath ar told will he final go down to stai out hi full
term below remark howev that in differ individu these rate
ar differ but in ani on thei ar alik now why should the whale
thu insist upon have hi spout out unless it be to replenish
hi reservoir of air er descend for good how obviou is it too
that thi necess for the whale rise expos him to all the fatal
hazard of the chase for not by hook or by net could thi vast
leviathan be caught when sail a thousand fathom beneath the
sunlight not so much thy skill then o hunter as the great
necess that strike the victori to thee
in man breath is incessantli go onon breath onli serv for
two or three pulsat so that whatev other busi he ha to
attend to wake or sleep breath he must or die he will but the
sperm whale onli breath about on seventh or sundai of hi time
it ha been said that the whale onli breath through hi spouthol
if it could truthfulli be ad that hi spout ar mix with water
then i opin we should be furnish with the reason why hi sens of
smell seem obliter in him for the onli thing about him that at
all answer to hi nose is that ident spouthol and be so
clog with two element it could not be expect to have the power
of smell but ow to the mysteri of the spoutwheth it be water
or whether it be vaporno absolut certainti can as yet be arriv at
on thi head sure it is nevertheless that the sperm whale ha no
proper olfactori but what doe he want of them no rose no
violet no colognewat in the sea
furthermor as hi windpip sole open into the tube of hi spout
canal and as that long canallik the grand eri canali furnish
with a sort of lock that open and shut for the downward retent of
air or the upward exclus of water therefor the whale ha no voic
unless you insult him by sai that when he so strang rumbl he
talk through hi nose but then again what ha the whale to sai
seldom have i known ani profound be that had anyth to sai to thi
world unless forc to stammer out someth by wai of get a
live oh happi that the world is such an excel listen
now the spout canal of the sperm whale chiefli intend as it is
for the convey of air and for sever feet laid along
horizont just beneath the upper surfac of hi head and a littl
to on side thi curiou canal is veri much like a gaspip laid down
in a citi on on side of a street but the question return whether
thi gaspip is also a waterpip in other word whether the spout
of the sperm whale is the mere vapor of the exhal breath or whether
that exhal breath is mix with water taken in at the mouth and
discharg through the spiracl it is certain that the mouth
indirectli commun with the spout canal but it cannot be
prove that thi is for the purpos of discharg water through the
spiracl becaus the greatest necess for so do would seem to be
when in feed he accident take in water but the sperm whale
food is far beneath the surfac and there he cannot spout even if he
would besid if you regard him veri close and time him with your
watch you will find that when unmolest there is an undevi
rhyme between the period of hi jet and the ordinari period of
respir
but why pester on with all thi reason on the subject speak out
you have seen him spout then declar what the spout is can you not
tell water from air my dear sir in thi world it is not so easi to
settl these plain thing i have ever found your plain thing the
knottiest of all and as for thi whale spout you might almost stand
in it and yet be undecid as to what it is precis
the central bodi of it is hidden in the snowi sparkl mist envelop
it and how can you certainli tell whether ani water fall from it
when alwai when you ar close enough to a whale to get a close view
of hi spout he is in a prodigi commot the water cascad all
around him and if at such time you should think that you realli
perceiv drop of moistur in the spout how do you know that thei ar
not mere condens from it vapor or how do you know that thei ar
not those ident drop superfici lodg in the spouthol
fissur which is countersunk into the summit of the whale head for
even when tranquilli swim through the middai sea in a calm with
hi elev hump sundri as a dromedari in the desert even then
the whale alwai carri a small basin of water on hi head as under a
blaze sun you will sometim see a caviti in a rock fill up with
rain
nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curiou touch the
precis natur of the whale spout it will not do for him to be peer
into it and put hi face in it you cannot go with your pitcher to
thi fountain and fill it and bring it awai for even when come into
slight contact with the outer vapori shred of the jet which will
often happen your skin will feverishli smart from the acrid of
the thing so touch it and i know on who come into still closer
contact with the spout whether with some scientif object in view or
otherwis i cannot sai the skin peel off from hi cheek and arm
wherefor among whalemen the spout is deem poison thei try to
evad it anoth thing i have heard it said and i do not much doubt
it that if the jet is fairli spout into your ey it will blind
you the wisest thing the investig can do then it seem to me is
to let thi deadli spout alon
still we can hypothes even if we cannot prove and establish my
hypothesi is thi that the spout is noth but mist and besid
other reason to thi conclus i am impel by consider
touch the great inher digniti and sublim of the sperm whale i
account him no common shallow be inasmuch as it is an undisput
fact that he is never found on sound or near shore all other
whale sometim ar he is both ponder and profound and i am
convinc that from the head of all ponder profound be such as
plato pyrrho the devil jupit dant and so on there alwai goe
up a certain semivis steam while in the act of think deep
thought while compos a littl treatis on etern i had the
curios to place a mirror befor me and er long saw reflect
there a curiou involv worm and undul in the atmospher over
my head the invari moistur of my hair while plung in deep
thought after six cup of hot tea in my thin shingl attic of an
august noon thi seem an addit argument for the abov
supposit
and how nobli it rais our conceit of the mighti misti monster to
behold him solemnli sail through a calm tropic sea hi vast mild
head overhung by a canopi of vapor engend by hi incommunic
contempl and that vapora you will sometim see itglorifi
by a rainbow as if heaven itself had put it seal upon hi thought
for dye see rainbow do not visit the clear air thei onli irradi
vapor and so through all the thick mist of the dim doubt in my
mind divin intuit now and then shoot enkindl my fog with a
heavenli rai and for thi i thank god for all have doubt mani deni
but doubt or denial few along with them have intuit doubt of
all thing earthli and intuit of some thing heavenli thi

regard them both with equal ey
chapter lxxxvi the tail

i celebr a tail
reckon the largest size sperm whale tail to begin at that point
of the trunk where it taper to about the girth of a man it compris
upon it upper surfac alon an area of at least fifti squar feet
the compact round bodi of it root expand into two broad firm flat
palm or fluke gradual shoal awai to less than an inch in
thick at the crotch or junction these fluke slightli overlap
then sidewai reced from each other like wing leav a wide vacanc
between in no live thing ar the line of beauti more exquisit
defin than in the crescent border of these fluke at it utmost
expans in the full grown whale the tail will consider exce
twenti feet across
the entir member seem a dens web bed of weld sinew but cut
into it and you find that three distinct strata compos itupp
middl and lower the fibr in the upper and lower layer ar long
and horizont those of the middl on veri short and run
crosswis between the outsid layer thi triun structur as much as
anyth els impart power to the tail to the student of old roman
wall the middl layer will furnish a curiou parallel to the thin
cours of tile alwai altern with the stone in those wonder
relic of the antiqu and which undoubtedli contribut so much to the
great strength of the masonri
but as if thi vast local power in the tendin tail were not enough
the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of
muscular fibr and filament which pass on either side the loin
and run down into the fluke insens blend with them and
larg contribut to their might so that in the tail the confluent
measureless forc of the whole whale seem concentr to a point
could annihil occur to matter thi were the thing to do it
nor doe thisit amaz strength at all tend to crippl the grace
flexion of it motion where infantil of eas undul through a
titan of power on the contrari those motion deriv their most
appal beauti from it real strength never impair beauti or
harmoni but it often bestow it and in everyth imposingli
beauti strength ha much to do with the magic take awai the ti
tendon that all over seem burst from the marbl in the carv
hercul and it charm would be gone as devout eckerman lift the
linen sheet from the nake corps of goeth he wa overwhelm with
the massiv chest of the man that seem as a roman triumphal arch
when angelo paint even god the father in human form mark what

hi idea ha been most successfulli embodi these pictur so
destitut as thei ar of all brawni hint noth of ani power but
the mere neg feminin on of submiss and endur which on

such is the subtl elast of the organ i treat of that whether
wield in sport or in earnest or in anger whatev be the mood it
be in it flexion ar invari mark by exceed grace therein
no fairi arm can transcend it
five great motion ar peculiar to it first when us as a fin for
progress second when us as a mace in battl third in sweep
fourth in lobtail fifth in peak fluke
first be horizont in it posit the leviathan tail act in a
differ manner from the tail of all other sea creatur it never
wriggl in man or fish wriggl is a sign of inferior to the
whale hi tail is the sole mean of propuls scrollwis coil
forward beneath the bodi and then rapidli sprung backward it is
thi which give that singular dart leap motion to the monster
when furious swim hi sidefin onli serv to steer by
second it is a littl signific that while on sperm whale onli
fight anoth sperm whale with hi head and jaw nevertheless in hi
conflict with man he chiefli and contemptu us hi tail in
strike at a boat he swiftli curv awai hi fluke from it and the
blow is onli inflict by the recoil if it be made in the unobstruct
air especi if it descend to it mark the stroke is then simpli
irresist no rib of man or boat can withstand it your onli
salvat li in elud it but if it come sidewai through the
oppos water then partli ow to the light buoyanc of the
whaleboat and the elast of it materi a crack rib or a
dash plank or two a sort of stitch in the side is gener the
most seriou result these submerg side blow ar so often receiv
in the fisheri that thei ar account mere child plai some on
strip off a frock and the hole is stop
third i cannot demonstr it but it seem to me that in the whale
the sens of touch is concentr in the tail for in thi respect
there is a delicaci in it onli equal by the dainti of the
eleph trunk thi delicaci is chiefli evinc in the action of
sweep when in maidenli gentl the whale with a certain soft
slow move hi immens fluke from side to side upon the surfac of
the sea and if he feel but a sailor whisker woe to that sailor
whisker and all what tender there is in that preliminari touch
had thi tail ani prehensil power i should straightwai bethink me of
darmonod eleph that so frequent the flowermarket and with low
salut present nosegai to damsel and then caress their
zone on more account than on a piti it is that the whale doe not
possess thi prehensil virtu in hi tail for i have heard of yet
anoth eleph that when wound in the fight curv round hi
trunk and extract the dart
fourth steal unawar upon the whale in the fanci secur of the
middl of solitari sea you find him unbent from the vast corpul
of hi digniti and kittenlik he plai on the ocean as if it were a
hearth but still you see hi power in hi plai the broad palm of hi
tail ar flirt high into the air then smite the surfac the
thunder concuss resound for mile you would almost think a
great gun had been discharg and if you notic the light wreath of
vapor from the spiracl at hi other extrem you would think that
that wa the smoke from the touchhol
fifth as in the ordinari float postur of the leviathan the fluke
lie consider below the level of hi back thei ar then complet
out of sight beneath the surfac but when he is about to plung into
the deep hi entir fluke with at least thirti feet of hi bodi ar
toss erect in the air and so remain vibrat a moment till thei
downward shoot out of view except the sublim breachsomewher
els to be describedthi peak of the whale fluke is perhap the
grandest sight to be seen in all anim natur out of the bottomless
profund the gigant tail seem spasmod snatch at the
highest heaven so in dream have i seen majest satan thrust
forth hi torment coloss claw from the flame baltic of hell but in
gaze at such scene it is all in all what mood you ar in if in the
dantean the devil will occur to you if in that of isaiah the
archangel stand at the masthead of my ship dure a sunris that
crimson sky and sea i onc saw a larg herd of whale in the east
all head toward the sun and for a moment vibrat in concert with
peak fluke as it seem to me at the time such a grand embodi
of ador of the god wa never beheld even in persia the home of
the fire worshipp as ptolemi philopat testifi of the african
eleph i then testifi of the whale pronounc him the most
devout of all be for accord to king juba the militari
eleph of antiqu often hail the morn with their trunk
uplift in the profoundest silenc
the chanc comparison in thi chapter between the whale and the
eleph so far as some aspect of the tail of the on and the trunk
of the other ar concern should not tend to place those two opposit
organ on an equal much less the creatur to which thei
respect belong for as the mightiest eleph is but a terrier to
leviathan so compar with leviathan tail hi trunk is but the
stalk of a lili the most dire blow from the eleph trunk were
as the play tap of a fan compar with the measureless crush and
crash of the sperm whale ponder fluke which in repeat
instanc have on after the other hurl entir boat with all their
oar and crew into the air veri much as an indian juggler toss hi
balls19
19 though all comparison in the wai of gener bulk between the
whale and the eleph is preposter inasmuch as in that particular
the eleph stand in much the same respect to the whale that a dog
doe to the eleph nevertheless there ar not want some point
of curiou similitud among these is the spout it is well known that
the eleph will often draw up water or dust in hi trunk and then
elev it jet it forth in a stream
the more i consid thi mighti tail the more do i deplor my
inabl to express it at time there ar gestur in it which
though thei would well grace the hand of man remain wholli
inexplic in an extens herd so remark occasion ar
these mystic gestur that i have heard hunter who have declar them
akin to freemason sign and symbol that the whale inde by these
method intellig convers with the world nor ar there want
other motion of the whale in hi gener bodi full of strang
and unaccount to hi most experienc assail dissect him how i
mai then i but go skin deep i know him not and never will but if i
know not even the tail of thi whale how understand hi head much
more how comprehend hi face when face he ha none thou shalt see my
back part my tail he seem to sai but my face shall not be seen
but i cannot complet make out hi back part and hint what he will
about hi face i sai again he ha no face

now as mani sperm whale had been captur off the western coast of

in the whale thei sai he is galli the compact martial column in

though mani of the whale as ha been said were in violent motion
yet it is to be observ that as a whole the herd neither advanc nor

most vexati and violent disput would often aris between the
fishermen were there not some written or unwritten univers
undisput law applic to all case
perhap the onli formal whale code author by legisl
enact wa that of holland it wa decre by the statesgener in
ad 1695 but though no other nation ha ever had ani written whale
law yet the american fishermen have been their own legisl and
lawyer in thi matter thei have provid a system which for ters
comprehens surpass justinian pandect and the bylaw of the
chines societi for the suppress of meddl with other peopl
busi ye these law might be engraven on a queen ann farth
or the barb of a harpoon and worn round the neck so small ar thei
i a fastfish belong to the parti fast to it
ii a loosefish is fair game for anybodi who can soonest catch it
but what plai the mischief with thi masterli code is the admir
breviti of it which necessit a vast volum of commentari to
expound it
first what is a fastfish aliv or dead a fish is technic fast
when it is connect with an occupi ship or boat by ani medium at
all control by the occup or occupantsa mast an oar a
nineinch cabl a telegraph wire or a strand of cobweb it is all the
same likewis a fish is technic fast when it bear a waif or ani
other recognis symbol of possess so long as the parti waif it
plainli evinc their abil at ani time to take it alongsid as well
as their intent so to do
these ar scientif commentari but the commentari of the whalemen
themselv sometim consist in hard word and harder knocksth
cokeuponlittleton of the fist true among the more upright and
honor whalemen allow ar alwai made for peculiar case where
it would be an outrag moral injustic for on parti to claim
possess of a whale previous chase or kill by anoth parti but
other ar by no mean so scrupul
some fifti year ago there wa a curiou case of whaletrov litig
in england wherein the plaintiff set forth that after a hard chase of
a whale in the northern sea and when inde thei the plaintiff had
succeed in harpoon the fish thei were at last through peril of
their live oblig to forsak not onli their line but their boat
itself ultim the defend the crew of anoth ship came up
with the whale struck kill seiz and final appropri it
befor the veri ey of the plaintiff and when those defend were
remonstr with their captain snap hi finger in the plaintiff
teeth and assur them that by wai of doxolog to the deed he had
done he would now retain their line harpoon and boat which had
remain attach to the whale at the time of the seizur wherefor
the plaintiff now su for the recoveri of the valu of their whale
line harpoon and boat
mr erskin wa counsel for the defend lord ellenborough wa the
judg in the cours of the defenc the witti erskin went on to
illustr hi posit by allud to a recent crim con case
wherein a gentleman after in vain try to bridl hi wife
vicious had at last abandon her upon the sea of life but in
the cours of year repent of that step he institut an action to
recov possess of her erskin wa on the other side and he then
support it by sai that though the gentleman had origin
harpoon the ladi and had onc had her fast and onli by reason of
the great stress of her plung vicious had as last abandon
her yet abandon her he did so that she becam a loosefish and
therefor when a subsequ gentleman reharpoon her the ladi then
becam that subsequ gentleman properti along with whatev
harpoon might have been found stick in her
now in the present case erskin contend that the exampl of the
whale and the ladi were reciproc illustr of each other
these plead and the counter plead be duli heard the veri
learn judg in set term decid to witthat as for the boat he
award it to the plaintiff becaus thei had mere abandon it to
save their live but that with regard to the controvert whale
harpoon and line thei belong to the defend the whale becaus
it wa a loosefish at the time of the final captur and the harpoon
and line becaus when the fish made off with them it the fish
acquir a properti in those articl and henc anybodi who afterward
took the fish had a right to them now the defend afterward took
the fish ergo the aforesaid articl were their
a common man look at thi decis of the veri learn judg might
possibl object to it but plough up to the primari rock of the
matter the two great principl laid down in the twin whale law
previous quot and appli and elucid by lord ellenborough in
the abov cite case these two law touch fastfish and loosefish
i sai will on reflect be found the fundament of all human
jurisprud for notwithstand it complic traceri of
sculptur the templ of the law like the templ of the philistin
ha but two prop to stand on
is it not a sai in everi on mouth possess is half of the law
that is regardless of how the thing came into possess but often
possess is the whole of the law what ar the sinew and soul of
russian serf and republican slave but fastfish whereof possess
is the whole of the law what to the rapaci landlord is the widow
last mite but a fastfish what is yonder undetect villain marbl
mansion with a doorplat for a waif what is that but a fastfish
what is the ruinou discount which mordecai the broker get from poor
woebegon the bankrupt on a loan to keep woebegon famili from
starvat what is that ruinou discount but a fastfish what is the
archbishop of savesoul incom of 100000 seiz from the scant bread
and chees of hundr of thousand of brokenback labor all sure
of heaven without ani of savesoul help what is that globular 100000
but a fastfish what ar the duke of dunder hereditari town and
hamlet but fastfish what to that redoubt harpoon john bull is
poor ireland but a fastfish what to that apostol lancer brother
jonathan is texa but a fastfish and concern all these is not
possess the whole of the law
but if the doctrin of fastfish be pretti gener applic the
kindr doctrin of loosefish is still more wide so that is
internation and univers applic

it seem that some honest marin of dover or sandwich or some on
of the cinqu port had after a hard chase succeed in kill and
beach a fine whale which thei had origin descri afar off from

jurisdict of a sort of policeman or beadl call a lord warden
hold the offic directli from the crown i believ all the royal

becaus the lord warden is busili emploi at time in fob hi

we have been at great troubl and peril and some expens and is all

it is hi
in a word the whale wa seiz and sold and hi grace the duke of

it will readili be seen that in thi case the alleg right of the duke
to the whale wa a deleg on from the sovereign we must need
inquir then on what principl the sovereign is origin invest
with that right the law itself ha alreadi been set forth but plowdon
give us the reason for it sai plowdon the whale so caught belong
to the king and queen becaus of it superior excel and by the
soundest comment thi ha ever been held a cogent argument in such

but why should the king have the head and the queen the tail a reason
for that ye lawyer

that ye queen wardrob mai be suppli with ye whalebon now thi
wa written at a time when the black limber bone of the greenland or
right whale wa larg us in ladi bodic but thi same bone is
not in the tail it is in the head which is a sad mistak for a

it wa a week or two after the last whale scene recount and when

mani nose on the pequod deck prove more vigil discover than
the three pair of ey aloft a peculiar and not veri pleasant smell
wa smelt in the sea
i will bet someth now said stubb that somewher hereabout ar
some of those drug whale we tickl the other dai i thought thei
would keel up befor long
present the vapor in advanc slid asid and there in the distanc
lai a ship whose furl sail betoken that some sort of whale must
be alongsid as we glide nearer the stranger show french color
from hi peak and by the eddi cloud of vultur seafowl that
circl and hover and swoop around him it wa plain that the
whale alongsid must be what the fishermen call a blast whale that
is a whale that ha di unmolest on the sea and so float an
unappropri corps it mai well be conceiv what an unsavori odor
such a mass must exhal wors than an assyrian citi in the plagu
when the live ar incompet to buri the depart so intoler
inde is it regard by some that no cupid could persuad them to
moor alongsid of it yet ar there those who will still do it
notwithstand the fact that the oil obtain from such subject is of
a veri inferior qualiti and by no mean of the natur of
attarofros
come still nearer with the expir breez we saw that the frenchman
had a second whale alongsid and thi second whale seem even more of
a nosegai than the first in truth it turn out to be on of those
problemat whale that seem to dry up and die with a sort of
prodigi dyspepsia or indigest leav their defunct bodi
almost entir bankrupt of anyth like oil nevertheless in the
proper place we shall see that no know fisherman will ever turn up
hi nose at such a whale as thi howev much he mai shun blast
whale in gener
the pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that stubb vow he
recogn hi cut spadepol entangl in the line that were
knot round the tail of on of these whale
there a pretti fellow now he banteringli laugh stand in the
ship bow there a jackal for ye i well know that these crappo
of frenchmen ar but poor devil in the fisheri sometim lower
their boat for breaker mistak them for sperm whale spout ye
and sometim sail from their port with their hold full of box of
tallow candl and case of snuffer forese that all the oil thei
will get wont be enough to dip the captain wick into ay we all
know these thing but look ye here a crappo that is content with
our leav the drug whale there i mean ay and is content too
with scrape the dry bone of that other preciou fish he ha there
poor devil i sai pass round a hat some on and let make him a
present of a littl oil for dear chariti sake for what oil hell get
from that drug whale there wouldnt be fit to burn in a jail no
not in a condemn cell and as for the other whale why ill agre to
get more oil by chop up and try out these three mast of our
than hell get from that bundl of bone though now that i think of
it it mai contain someth worth a good deal more than oil ye
ambergri i wonder now if our old man ha thought of that it worth
try ye im for it and so sai he start for the
quarterdeck
by thi time the faint air had becom a complet calm so that whether
or no the pequod wa now fairli entrap in the smell with no hope

roserosebutton or rosebud and thi wa the romant name of thi
aromat ship
though stubb did not understand the bouton part of the inscript
yet the word rose and the bulbou figurehead put togeth
suffici explain the whole to him
a wooden rosebud eh he cri with hi hand to hi nose that will
do veri well but how like all creation it smell
now in order to hold direct commun with the peopl on deck he
had to pull round the bow to the starboard side and thu come close
to the blast whale and so talk over it
arriv then at thi spot with on hand still to hi nose he
bawledboutonderos ahoi ar there ani of you boutonderos that

anyth to oblig ye my sweet and pleasant fellow rejoin stubb
and with that he soon mount to the deck there a queer scene
present itself the sailor in tassel cap of red worst were
get the heavi tackl in readi for the whale but thei work
rather slow and talk veri fast and seem in anyth but a good
humor all their nose upwardli project from their face like so mani
jibboom now and then pair of them would drop their work and run up
to the masthead to get some fresh air some think thei would catch
the plagu dip oakum in coaltar and at interv held it to their
nostril other have broken the stem of their pipe almost short
off at the bowl were vigor puf tobaccosmok so that it
constantli fill their olfactori
stubb wa struck by a shower of outcri and anathema proceed from
the captain roundhous abaft and look in that direct saw a
fieri face thrust from behind the door which wa held ajar from
within thi wa the torment surgeon who after in vain
remonstr against the proceed of the dai had betaken himself
to the captain roundhous cabinet he call it to avoid the
pest but still could not help yell out hi entreati and
indign at time
mark all thi stubb argu well for hi scheme and turn to the
guernseyman had a littl chat with him dure which the stranger mate
express hi detest of hi captain as a conceit ignoramu who
had brought them all into so unsavori and unprofit a pickl
sound him carefulli stubb further perceiv that the guernseyman
had not the slightest suspicion concern the ambergri he therefor
held hi peac on that head but otherwis wa quit frank and
confidenti with him so that the two quickli concoct a littl plan
for both circumv and satir the captain without hi at all
dream of distrust their sincer accord to thi littl plan
of their the guernseyman under cover of an interpret offic
wa to tell the captain what he pleas but as come from stubb and
as for stubb he wa to utter ani nonsens that should come uppermost
in him dure the interview
by thi time their destin victim appear from hi cabin he wa a
small and dark but rather delic look man for a seacaptain with
larg whisker and moustach howev and wore a red cotton velvet
vest with watchseal at hi side to thi gentleman stubb wa now
polit introduc by the guernseyman who at onc ostentati put
on the aspect of interpret between them
what shall i sai to him first said he
why said stubb ey the velvet vest and the watch and seal you
mai as well begin by tell him that he look a sort of babyish to me
though i dont pretend to be a judg
he sai monsieur said the guernseyman in french turn to hi
captain that onli yesterdai hi ship spoke a vessel whose captain
and chiefmat with six sailor had all di of a fever caught from a
blast whale thei had brought alongsid
upon thi the captain start and eagerli desir to know more
what now said the guernseyman to stubb
why sinc he take it so easi tell him that now i have ei him
carefulli im quit certain that he no more fit to command a

he vow and declar monsieur that the other whale the dri on
is far more deadli than the blast on in fine monsieur he conjur
us as we valu our live to cut loos from these fish
instantli the captain ran forward and in a loud voic command hi
crew to desist from hoist the cuttingtackl and at onc cast
loos the cabl and chain confin the whale to the ship
what now said the guernseyman when the captain had return to

he sai monsieur that hi principl wont admit of hi drink
but that if monsieur want to live anoth dai to drink then monsieur
had best drop all four boat and pull the ship awai from these whale

by thi time stubb wa over the side and get into hi boat hail
the guernseyman to thi effectthat have a long towlin in hi

lighter whale of the two from the ship side while the frenchman

chapter xcii ambergri
now thi ambergri is a veri curiou substanc and so import as an
articl of commerc that in 1791 a certain nantucketborn captain
coffin wa examin at the bar of the english hous of common on that
subject for at that time and inde until a compar late dai
the precis origin of ambergri remain like amber itself a problem
to the learn though the word ambergri is but the french compound
for grei amber yet the two substanc ar quit distinct for amber
though at time found on the seacoast is also dug up in some far
inland soil wherea ambergri is never found except upon the sea
besid amber is a hard transpar brittl odorless substanc
us for mouthpiec to pipe for bead and ornament but ambergri
is soft waxi and so highli fragrant and spici that it is larg
us in perfumeri in pastil preciou candl hairpowd and
pomatum the turk us it in cook and also carri it to mecca for
the same purpos that frankincens is carri to st peter in rome
some wine merchant drop a few grain into claret to flavor it
who would think then that such fine ladi and gentlemen should
regal themselv with an essenc found in the inglori bowel of a
sick whale yet so it is by some ambergri is suppos to be the
caus and by other the effect of the dyspepsia in the whale how to
cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to sai unless by administ
three or four boat load of brandreth pill and then run out of
harm wai as labor do in blast rock
i have forgotten to sai that there were found in thi ambergri
certain hard round boni plate which at first stubb thought might be
sailor trouser button but it afterward turn out that thei were
noth more than piec of small squid bone embalm in that manner
now that the incorrupt of thi most fragrant ambergri should be
found in the heart of such decai is thi noth bethink thee of that
sai of st paul in corinthian about corrupt and incorrupt
how that we ar sown in dishonor but rais in glori and likewis
call to mind that sai of paracelsu about what it is that maketh the
best musk also forget not the strang fact that of all thing of
illsavor colognewat in it rudiment manufactur stage is
the worst
i should like to conclud the chapter with the abov appeal but
cannot ow to my anxieti to repel a charg often made against
whalemen and which in the estim of some alreadi bias mind
might be consid as indirectli substanti by what ha been said
of the frenchman two whale elsewher in thi volum the slander
aspers ha been disprov that the vocat of whale is
throughout a slatternli untidi busi but there is anoth thing to
rebut thei hint that all whale alwai smell bad now how did thi
odiou stigma origin
i opin that it is plainli traceabl to the first arriv of the
greenland whale ship in london more than two centuri ago becaus
those whalemen did not then and do not now try out their oil at sea
as the southern ship have alwai done but cut up the fresh
blubber in small bit thrust it through the bung hole of larg cask
and carri it home in that manner the short of the season in those
ici sea and the sudden and violent storm to which thei ar expos
forbid ani other cours the consequ is that upon break
into the hold and unload on of these whale cemeteri in the
greenland dock a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that aris
from excav an old citi graveyard for the foundat of a
lyingin hospit
i partli surmis also that thi wick charg against whaler mai be
likewis imput to the exist on the coast of greenland in former
time of a dutch villag call schmerenburgh or smeerenberg which
latter name is the on us by the learn fogo von slack in hi great
work on smell a textbook on that subject as it name import smeer
fat berg to put up thi villag wa found in order to afford a
place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be tri out without
be taken home to holland for that purpos it wa a collect of
furnac fatkettl and oil shed and when the work were in full
oper certainli gave forth no veri pleasant savor but all thi is
quit differ from a south sea sperm whaler which in a voyag of
four year perhap after complet fill her hold with oil doe
not perhap consum fifti dai in the busi of boil out and in
the state that it is cask the oil is nearli scentless the truth is
that live or dead if but decent treat whale as a speci ar
by no mean creatur of ill odor nor can whalemen be recognis as
the peopl of the middl ag affect to detect a jew in the compani
by the nose nor inde can the whale possibl be otherwis than
fragrant when as a gener thing he enjoi such high health take
abund of exercis alwai out of door though it is true seldom
in the open air i sai that the motion of a sperm whale fluke abov
water dispens a perfum as when a muskscent ladi rustl her
dress in a warm parlor what then shall i liken the sperm whale to for
fragranc consid hi magnitud must it not be to that famou
eleph with jewel tusk and redol with myrrh which wa led
out of an indian town to do honor to alexand the great
chapter xciii the castawai
it wa but some few dai after encount the frenchman that a most
signific event befel the most insignific of the pequod crew
an event most lament and which end in provid the sometim
madli merri and predestin craft with a live and ever accompani
propheci of whatev shatter sequel might prove her own
now in the whale ship it is not everi on that goe in the boat
some few hand ar reserv call shipkeep whose provinc it is
to work the vessel while the boat ar pursu the whale as a gener
thing these shipkeep ar as hardi fellow as the men compris
the boat crew but if there happen to be an unduli slender clumsi
or timor wight in the ship that wight is certain to be made a
shipkeep it wa so in the pequod with the littl negro pippin by
nicknam pip by abbrevi poor pip ye have heard of him befor
ye must rememb hi tambourin on that dramat midnight so
gloomyjolli
in outer aspect pip and doughboi made a match like a black poni and
a white on of equal develop though of dissimilar color driven

bottom veri bright with that pleasant genial jolli bright
peculiar to hi tribe a tribe which ever enjoi all holidai and
festiv with finer freer relish than ani other race for black
the year calendar should show naught but three hundr and sixtyf
fourth of juli and new year dai nor smile so while i write that
thi littl black wa brilliant for even black ha it brillianc
behold yon lustrou eboni panel in king cabinet but pip love
life and all life peaceabl secur so that the panicstrik
busi in which he had somehow unaccount becom entrap had
most sadli blur hi bright though as er long will be seen
what wa thu temporarili subdu in him in the end wa destin to be
luridli illumin by strang wild fire that fictiti show him
off to ten time the natur lustr with which in hi nativ tolland
counti in connecticut he had onc enliven mani a fiddler frolic on

jewel would show you the diamond in it most impress lustr he
lai it against a gloomi ground and then light it up not by the sun
but by some unnatur gase then come out those fieri effulg
infern superb then the evilblaz diamond onc the divinest
symbol of the crystal ski look like some crownjewel stolen from
the king of hell but let us to the stori
it came to pass that in the ambergri affair stubb afteroarsman
chanc so to sprain hi hand as for a time to becom quit maim
and temporarili pip wa put into hi place
the first time stubb lower with him pip evinc much nervous
but happili for that time escap close contact with the whale and
therefor came off not altogeth discredit though stubb observ
him took care afterward to exhort him to cherish hi courag
to the utmost for he might often find it need
now upon the second lower the boat paddl upon the whale and as
the fish receiv the dart iron it gave it customari rap which
happen in thi instanc to be right under poor pip seat the
involuntari constern of the moment caus him to leap paddl in
hand out of the boat and in such a wai that part of the slack whale
line come against hi chest he breast it overboard with him so as
to becom entangl in it when at last plump into the water that
instant the stricken whale start on a fierc run the line swiftli
straighten and presto poor pip came all foam up to the chock of
the boat remorselessli drag there by the line which had taken
sever turn around hi chest and neck
tashtego stood in the bow he wa full of the fire of the hunt he
hate pip for a poltroon snatch the boatknif from it sheath he
suspend it sharp edg over the line and turn toward stubb
exclaim interrog cut meantim pip blue choke face
plainli look do for god sake all pass in a flash in less than

damn him cut roar stubb and so the whale wa lost and pip wa
save
so soon as he recov himself the poor littl negro wa assail by
yell and execr from the crew tranquilli permit these
irregular curs to evapor stubb then in a plain businesslik
but still half humor manner curs pip offici and that done
unoffici gave him much wholesom advic the substanc wa never
jump from a boat pip exceptbut all the rest wa indefinit as the
soundest advic ever is now in gener stick to the boat is your
true motto in whale but case will sometim happen when leap from
the boat is still better moreov as if perceiv at last that if
he should give undilut conscienti advic to pip he would be
leav him too wide a margin to jump in for the futur stubb suddenli
drop all advic and conclud with a peremptori command stick to
the boat pip or by the lord i wont pick you up if you jump mind
that we cant afford to lose whale by the like of you a whale would
sell for thirti time what you would pip in alabama bear that in
mind and dont jump ani more herebi perhap stubb indirectli hint
that though man love hi fellow yet man is a moneymak anim
which propens too often interfer with hi benevol
but we ar all in the hand of the god and pip jump again it wa
under veri similar circumst to the first perform but thi
time he did not breast out the line and henc when the whale start
to run pip wa left behind on the sea like a hurri travel
trunk ala stubb wa but too true to hi word it wa a beauti
bounteou blue dai the spangl sea calm and cool and flatli
stretch awai all round to the horizon like goldbeat skin
hammer out to the extremest bob up and down in that sea pip
ebon head show like a head of clove no boatknif wa lift when
he fell so rapidli astern stubb inexor back wa turn upon him
and the whale wa wing in three minut a whole mile of shoreless
ocean wa between pip and stubb out from the centr of the sea poor
pip turn hi crisp curl black head to the sun anoth lone
castawai though the loftiest and the brightest
now in calm weather to swim in the open ocean is as easi to the
practis swimmer as to ride in a springcarriag ashor but the aw
lonesom is intoler the intens concentr of self in the
middl of such a heartless immens my god who can tell it mark
how when sailor in a dead calm bath in the open seamark how close
thei hug their ship and onli coast along her side
but had stubb realli abandon the poor littl negro to hi fate no
he did not mean to at least becaus there were two boat in hi wake
and he suppos no doubt that thei would of cours come up to pip
veri quickli and pick him up though inde such consider
toward oarsmen jeopard through their own timid is not alwai
manifest by the hunter in all similar instanc and such instanc
not unfrequ occur almost invari in the fisheri a coward so
call is mark with the same ruthless detest peculiar to
militari navi and armi
but it so happen that those boat without see pip suddenli
spy whale close to them on on side turn and gave chase and
stubb boat wa now so far awai and he and all hi crew so intent
upon hi fish that pip ring horizon began to expand around him
miser by the merest chanc the ship itself at last rescu him
but from that hour the littl negro went about the deck an idiot such
at least thei said he wa the sea had jeeringli kept hi finit bodi
up but drown the infinit of hi soul not drown entir though
rather carri down aliv to wondrou depth where strang shape of
the unwarp primal world glide to and fro befor hi passiv ey
and the misermerman wisdom reveal hi hoard heap and among the
joyou heartless everjuvenil etern pip saw the multitudin
godomnipres coral insect that out of the firmament of water
heav the coloss orb he saw god foot upon the treadl of the

man insan is heaven sens and wander from all mortal reason
man come at last to that celesti thought which to reason is
absurd and frantic and weal or woe feel then uncompromis

for the rest blame not stubb too hardli the thing is common in that
fisheri and in the sequel of the narr it will then be seen what
like abandon befel myself
chapter xciv a squeez of the hand
that whale of stubb so dearli purchas wa duli brought to the
pequod side where all those cut and hoist oper
previous detail were regularli gone through even to the bale of
the heidelburgh tun or case
while some were occupi with thi latter duti other were emploi in
drag awai the larger tub so soon as fill with the sperm and
when the proper time arriv thi same sperm wa carefulli manipul
er go to the trywork of which anon
it had cool and crystal to such a degre that when with
sever other i sat down befor a larg constantin bath of it i
found it strang concret into lump here and there roll about
in the liquid part it wa our busi to squeez these lump back
into fluid a sweet and unctuou duti no wonder that in old time thi
sperm wa such a favorit cosmet such a clearer such a sweeten
such a soften such a delici mollifi after have my hand in
it for onli a few minut my finger felt like eel and began as it
were to serpentin and spiral
as i sat there at my eas crossleg on the deck after the bitter
exert at the windlass under a blue tranquil sky the ship under
indol sail and glide so seren along as i bath my hand
among those soft gentl globul of infiltr tissu woven almost
within the hour as thei richli broke to my finger and discharg all
their opul like fulli ripe grape their wine as i snuf up that
uncontamin aromaliter and truli like the smell of spring
violet i declar to you that for the time i live as in a muski
meadow i forgot all about our horribl oath in that inexpress
sperm i wash my hand and my heart of it i almost began to credit
the old paracelsan superstit that sperm is of rare virtu in
allai the heat of anger while bath in that bath i felt divin
free from all illwil or petul or malic of ani sort
whatsoev
squeez squeez squeez all the morn long i squeez that sperm
till i myself almost melt into it i squeez that sperm till a
strang sort of insan came over me and i found myself unwittingli
squeez my colabor hand in it mistak their hand for the
gentl globul such an abound affection friendli love
feel did thi avoc beget that at last i wa continu
squeez their hand and look up into their ey sentiment as
much as to sayoh my dear fellow be why should we longer cherish
ani social acerb or know the slightest illhumor or envi come
let us squeez hand all round nai let us all squeez ourselv into
each other let us squeez ourselv univers into the veri milk and
sperm of kind
would that i could keep squeez that sperm for ever for now sinc
by mani prolong repeat experi i have perceiv that in all
case man must eventu lower or at least shift hi conceit of
attain felic not place it anywher in the intellect or the
fanci but in the wife the heart the bed the tabl the saddl the
firesid the countri now that i have perceiv all thi i am readi
to squeez case etern in thought of the vision of the night i
saw long row of angel in paradis each with hi hand in a jar of
spermaceti
now while discours of sperm it behoov to speak of other thing
akin to it in the busi of prepar the sperm whale for the
trywork
first come whitehors so call which is obtain from the taper
part of the fish and also from the thicker portion of hi fluke it
is tough with congeal tendonsa wad of musclebut still contain some
oil after be sever from the whale the whitehors is first cut
into portabl oblong er go to the mincer thei look much like
block of berkshir marbl
plumpud is the term bestow upon certain fragmentari part of the
whale flesh here and there adher to the blanket of blubber and
often particip to a consider degre in it unctuous it is
a most refresh convivi beauti object to behold as it name
import it is of an exceedingli rich mottl tint with a bestreak
snowi and golden ground dot with spot of the deepest crimson and
purpl it is plum of rubi in pictur of citron spite of reason
it is hard to keep yourself from eat it i confess that onc i
stole behind the foremast to try it it tast someth as i should
conceiv a royal cutlet from the thigh of loui le gro might have
tast suppos him to have been kill the first dai after the
venison season and that particular venison season contemporari with an
unusu fine vintag of the vineyard of champagn
there is anoth substanc and a veri singular on which turn up in
the cours of thi busi but which i feel it to be veri puzzl
adequ to describ it is call slobgollion an appel
origin with the whalemen and even so is the natur of the substanc
it is an ineff oozi stringi affair most frequent found in the
tub of sperm after a prolong squeez and subsequ decant i
hold it to be the wondrous thin ruptur membran of the case
coalesc
gurri so call is a term properli belong to right whalemen but
sometim incident us by the sperm fishermen it design the
dark glutin substanc which is scrape off the back of the
greenland or right whale and much of which cover the deck of those
inferior soul who hunt that ignobl leviathan
nipper strictli thi word is not indigen to the whale
vocabulari but as appli by whalemen it becom so a whaleman
nipper is a short firm strip of tendin stuff cut from the taper
part of leviathan tail it averag an inch in thick and for the
rest is about the size of the iron part of a hoe edgewis move along
the oili deck it oper like a leathern squilge and by nameless
blandish as of magic allur along with it all impur
but to learn all about these recondit matter your best wai is at
onc to descend into the blubberroom and have a long talk with it
inmat thi place ha previous been mention as the receptacl for
the blanketpiec when stript and hoist from the whale when the
proper time arriv for cut up it content thi apart is a
scene of terror to all tyro especi by night on on side lit by
a dull lantern a space ha been left clear for the workmen thei
gener go in pairsa pikeandgaffman and a spademan the
whalingpik is similar to a frigat boardingweapon of the same
name the gaff is someth like a boathook with hi gaff the
gaffman hook on to a sheet of blubber and strive to hold it from
slip as the ship pitch and lurch about meanwhil the
spademan stand on the sheet itself perpendicularli chop it into
the portabl horsepiec thi spade is sharp as hone can make it the
spademan feet ar shoeless the thing he stand on will sometim
irresist slide awai from him like a sledg if he cut off on of
hi own toe or on of hi assist would you be veri much
astonish toe ar scarc among veteran blubberroom men
chapter xcv the cassock

the trywork ar plant between the foremast and mainmast the most

fit to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and
mortar some ten feet by eight squar and five in height the

remov the fireboard from the front of the trywork the bare
masonri of that side is expos penetr by the two iron mouth of
the furnac directli underneath the pot these mouth ar fit
with heavi door of iron the intens heat of the fire is prevent

extend under the entir inclos surfac of the work by a tunnel
insert at the rear thi reservoir is kept replenish with water as
fast as it evapor there ar no extern chimnei thei open direct

it wa about nine oclock at night that the pequod trywork were
first start on thi present voyag it belong to stubb to overse
the busi
all readi there off hatch then and start her you cook fire the
work thi wa an easi thing for the carpent had been thrust
hi shave into the furnac throughout the passag here be it said
that in a whale voyag the first fire in the trywork ha to be fed
for a time with wood after that no wood is us except as a mean of
quick ignit to the stapl fuel in a word after be tri out
the crisp shrivel blubber now call scrap or fritter still
contain consider of it unctuou properti these fritter feed
the flame like a plethor burn martyr or a selfconsum
misanthrop onc ignit the whale suppli hi own fuel and burn by
hi own bodi would that he consum hi own smoke for hi smoke is
horribl to inhal and inhal it you must and not onli that but you
must live in it for the time it ha an unspeak wild hindoo odor
about it such as mai lurk in the vicin of funer pyre it smell
like the left wing of the dai of judgment it is an argument for the
pit
by midnight the work were in full oper we were clear from the
carcas sail had been made the wind wa freshen the wild ocean
dark wa intens but that dark wa lick up by the fierc
flame which at interv fork forth from the sooti flue and
illumin everi lofti rope in the rig as with the fame greek
fire the burn ship drove on as if remorselessli commiss to
some veng deed so the pitch and sulphurfreight brig of the
bold hydriot canari issu from their midnight harbor with broad
sheet of flame for sail bore down upon the turkish frigat and
fold them in conflagr
the hatch remov from the top of the work now afford a wide
hearth in front of them stand on thi were the tartarean shape of
the pagan harpoon alwai the whaleship stoker with huge
prong pole thei pitch hiss mass of blubber into the scald
pot or stir up the fire beneath till the snaki flame dart
curl out of the door to catch them by the feet the smoke roll
awai in sullen heap to everi pitch of the ship there wa a pitch of
the boil oil which seem all eager to leap into their face
opposit the mouth of the work on the further side of the wide wooden
hearth wa the windlass thi serv for a seasofa here loung the
watch when not otherwis emploi look into the red heat of the
fire till their ey felt scorch in their head their tawni
featur now all begrim with smoke and sweat their mat beard
and the contrast barbar brillianc of their teeth all these were
strang reveal in the caprici emblazon of the work as thei
narrat to each other their unholi adventur their tale of terror
told in word of mirth as their uncivil laughter fork upward
out of them like the flame from the furnac as to and fro in their
front the harpoon wildli gesticul with their huge prong
fork and dipper as the wind howl on and the sea leap and the
ship groan and dive and yet steadfastli shot her red hell further
and further into the black of the sea and the night and scornfulli
champ the white bone in her mouth and vicious spat round her on
all side then the rush pequod freight with savag and laden
with fire and burn a corps and plung into that black of
dark seem the materi counterpart of her monomaniac command
soul
so seem it to me as i stood at her helm and for long hour silent
guid the wai of thi fireship on the sea wrap for that
interv in dark myself i but the better saw the red the
mad the ghastli of other the continu sight of the fiend
shape befor me caper half in smoke and half in fire these at
last begat kindr vision in my soul so soon as i began to yield to
that unaccount drowsi which ever would come over me at a
midnight helm
but that night in particular a strang and ever sinc inexplic
thing occur to me start from a brief stand sleep i wa
horribl consciou of someth fatal wrong the jawbon tiller
smote my side which lean against it in my ear wa the low hum of
sail just begin to shake in the wind i thought my ey were
open i wa half consciou of put my finger to the lid and
mechan stretch them still further apart but spite of all
thi i could see no compass befor me to steer by though it seem
but a minut sinc i had been watch the card by the steadi binnacl
lamp illumin it noth seem befor me but a jet gloom now and
then made ghastli by flash of red uppermost wa the impress
that whatev swift rush thing i stood on wa not so much bound to
ani haven ahead as rush from all haven astern a stark bewild
feel as of death came over me convuls my hand grasp the
tiller but with the crazi conceit that the tiller wa somehow in
some enchant wai invert my god what is the matter with me
thought i lo in my brief sleep i had turn myself about and wa
front the ship stern with my back to her prow and the compass in
an instant i face back just in time to prevent the vessel from fly
up into the wind and veri probabl capsiz her how glad and how
grate the relief from thi unnatur hallucin of the night and
the fatal conting of be brought by the lee
look not too long in the face of the fire o man never dream with thy
hand on the helm turn not thy back to the compass accept the first
hint of the hitch tiller believ not the artifici fire when it
red make all thing look ghastli tomorrow in the natur sun
the ski will be bright those who glare like devil in the fork
flame the morn will show in far other at least gentler relief the
gloriou golden glad sun the onli true lampal other but liar
nevertheless the sun hide not virginia dismal swamp nor rome
accurs campagna nor wide sahara nor all the million of mile of
desert and of grief beneath the moon the sun hide not the ocean
which is the dark side of thi earth and which is two third of thi
earth so therefor that mortal man who hath more of joi than sorrow
in him that mortal man cannot be truenot true or undevelop with
book the same the truest of all men wa the man of sorrow and the
truest of all book is solomon and ecclesiast is the fine hammer
steel of woe all is vaniti all thi wil world hath not got hold
of unchristian solomon wisdom yet but he who dodg hospit and
jail and walk fast cross graveyard and would rather talk of
opera than hell call cowper young pascal rousseau poor devil
all of sick men and throughout a carefre lifetim swear by rabelai
as pass wise and therefor jollynot that man is fit to sit
down on tombston and break the green damp mould with unfathom
wondrou solomon
but even solomon he sai the man that wandereth out of the wai of
understand shall remain i e even while live in the
congreg of the dead give not thyself up then to fire lest it
invert thee deaden thee as for the time it did me there is a wisdom
that is woe but there is a woe that is mad and there is a
catskil eagl in some soul that can alik dive down into the blackest
gorg and soar out of them again and becom invis in the sunni
space and even if he for ever fli within the gorg that gorg is
in the mountain so that even in hi lowest swoop the mountain eagl
is still higher than other bird upon the plain even though thei soar

telescop there i saw him on the line last season
and he took that arm off did he ask ahab now slide down from
the capstan and rest on the englishman shoulder as he did so
ay he wa the caus of it at least and that leg too
spin me the yarn said ahab how wa it
it wa the first time in my life that i ever cruis on the line
began the englishman i wa ignor of the white whale at that time
well on dai we lower for a pod of four or five whale and my boat

the truth wa sir it wa as ugli gape wound as surgeon ever saw
more than two feet and sever inch long i measur it with the lead
line in short it grew black i knew what wa threaten and off it
came but i had no hand in ship that ivori arm there that thing is

bunger in the wateri world bunger when you die you ought to die in

what becam of the white whale now cri ahab who thu far had been
impati listen to thi byeplai between the two englishmen
oh cri the onearm captain oh ye well after he sound we
didnt see him again for some time in fact as i befor hint i
didnt then know what whale it wa that had serv me such a trick
till some time afterward when come back to the line we heard about
mobi dicka some call himand then i knew it wa he
didst thou cross hi wake again
twice
but could not fasten
didnt want to try to aint on limb enough what should i do without
thi other arm and im think mobi dick doesnt bite so much as he
swallow
well then interrupt bunger give him your left arm for bait to
get the right do you know gentlemenveri grave and mathemat
bow to each captain in successiondo you know gentlemen that the
digest organ of the whale ar so inscrut construct by divin
provid that it is quit imposs for him to complet digest
even a man arm and he know it too so that what you take for the
white whale malic is onli hi awkward for he never mean to
swallow a singl limb he onli think to terrifi by feint but
sometim he is like the old juggl fellow formerli a patient of
mine in ceylon that make believ swallow jackkniv onc upon a

twelvemonth or more when i gave him an emet and he heav it up in
small tack dye see no possibl wai for him to digest that
jackknif and fulli incorpor it into hi gener bodili system
ye captain boomer if you ar quick enough about it and have a mind
to pawn on arm for the sake of the privileg of give decent burial
to the other why in that case the arm is your onli let the whale
have anoth chanc at you shortli that all
no thank ye bunger said the english captain he welcom to the

anoth on no more white whale for me iv lower for him onc
and that ha satisfi me there would be great glori in kill him i
know that and there is a shipload of preciou sperm in him but hark

chapter ci the decant
er the english ship fade from sight be it set down here that she
hail from london and wa name after the late samuel enderbi
merchant of that citi the origin of the famou whale hous of
enderbi son a hous which in my poor whaleman opinion come not
far behind the unit royal hous of the tudor and bourbon in point
of real histor interest how long prior to the year of our lord
1775 thi great whale hous wa in exist my numer
fishdocu do not make plain but in that year 1775 it fit out
the first english ship that ever regularli hunt the sperm whale
though for some score of year previou ever sinc 1726 our valiant
coffin and macei of nantucket and the vineyard had in larg fleet
pursu that leviathan but onli in the north and south atlant not
elsewher be it distinctli record here that the nantucket were
the first among mankind to harpoon with civil steel the great sperm
whale and that for half a centuri thei were the onli peopl of the
whole globe who so harpoon him
in 1778 a fine ship the amelia fit out for the express purpos
and at the sole charg of the vigor enderbi boldli round cape
horn and wa the first among the nation to lower a whaleboat of ani
sort in the great south sea the voyag wa a skil and lucki on
and return to her berth with her hold full of the preciou sperm
the amelia exampl wa soon follow by other ship english and
american and thu the vast sperm whale ground of the pacif were
thrown open but not content with thi good deed the indefatig
hous again bestir itself samuel and all hi sonshow mani their
mother onli knowsand under their immedi auspic and partli i
think at their expens the british govern wa induc to send the
sloopofwar rattler on a whale voyag of discoveri into the south
sea command by a naval postcaptain the rattler made a rattl
voyag of it and did some servic how much doe not appear but thi
is not all in 1819 the same hous fit out a discoveri whale ship
of their own to go on a tast cruis to the remot water of japan
that shipwel call the syrenmad a nobl experiment cruis and
it wa thu that the great japanes whale ground first becam
gener known the syren in thi famou voyag wa command by a
captain coffin a nantucket
all honor to the enderbi therefor whose hous i think exist to
the present dai though doubtless the origin samuel must long ago
have slip hi cabl for the great south sea of the other world
the ship name after him wa worthi of the honor be a veri fast
sailer and a nobl craft everi wai i board her onc at midnight
somewher off the patagonian coast and drank good flip down in the
forecastl it wa a fine gam we had and thei were all trumpseveri
soul on board a short life to them and a jolli death and that fine
gam i hadlong veri long after old ahab touch her plank with hi
ivori heelit mind me of the nobl solid saxon hospit of that
ship and mai my parson forget me and the devil rememb me if i ever
lose sight of it flip did i sai we had flip ye and we flip it
at the rate of ten gallon the hour and when the squall came for it
squalli off there by patagonia and all handsvisitor and allwer
call to reef topsail we were so topheavi that we had to swing each
other aloft in bowlin and we ignorantli furl the skirt of our
jacket into the sail so that we hung there reef fast in the
howl gale a warn exampl to all drunken tar howev the mast
did not go overboard and by and bye we scrambl down so sober that
we had to pass the flip again though the savag salt sprai burst
down the forecastl scuttl rather too much dilut and pickl it to
my tast
the beef wa finetough but with bodi in it thei said it wa
bullbeef other that it wa dromedari beef but i do not know for
certain how that wa thei had dumpl too small but substanti
symmetr globular and indestruct dumpl i fanci that
you could feel them and roll them about in you after thei were
swallow if you stoop over too far forward you risk their
pitch out of you like billiardbal the breadbut that couldnt be
help besid it wa an antiscorbut in short the bread
contain the onli fresh fare thei had but the forecastl wa not veri
light and it wa veri easi to step over into a dark corner when you
at it but all in all take her from truck to helm consid the
dimens of the cook boiler includ hi own live parchment
boiler fore and aft i sai the samuel enderbi wa a jolli ship of
good fare and plenti fine flip and strong crack fellow all and
capit from boot heel to hatband
but why wa it think ye that the samuel enderbi and some other
english whaler i know ofnot all thoughwer such famou hospit
ship that pass round the beef and the bread and the can and the
joke and were not soon weari of eat and drink and laugh i
will tell you the abound good cheer of these english whaler is
matter for histor research nor have i been at all spare of
histor whale research when it ha seem need
the english were preced in the whale fisheri by the holland
zealand and dane from whom thei deriv mani term still extant
in the fisheri and what is yet more their fat old fashion touch
plenti to eat and drink for as a gener thing the english
merchantship scrimp her crew but not so the english whaler henc
in the english thi thing of whale good cheer is not normal and
natur but incident and particular and therefor must have some
special origin which is here point out and will be still further
elucid
dure my research in the leviathan histori i stumbl upon an
ancient dutch volum which by the musti whale smell of it i knew
must be about whaler the titl wa dan coopman wherefor i
conclud that thi must be the invalu memoir of some amsterdam
cooper in the fisheri as everi whale ship must carri it cooper i wa
reinforc in thi opinion by see that it wa the product of on
fitz swackhamm but my friend dr snodhead a veri learn man
professor of low dutch and high german in the colleg of santa clau
and st pott to whom i hand the work for translat give him a
box of sperm candl for hi troublethi same dr snodhead so soon as
he spi the book assur me that dan coopman did not mean the
cooper but the merchant in short thi ancient and learn low
dutch book treat of the commerc of holland and among other
subject contain a veri interest account of it whale fisheri
and in thi chapter it wa head smeer or fat that i found a
long detail list of the outfit for the larder and cellar of 180
sail of dutch whalemen from which list as translat by dr snodhead
i transcrib the follow
400000 lb of beef
60000 lb friesland pork
150000 lb of stock fish
550000 lb of biscuit
72000 lb of soft bread
2800 firkin of butter
20000 lb texel leyden chees
144000 lb chees probabl an inferior articl
550 anker of geneva
10800 barrel of beer
most statist tabl ar parchingli dry in the read not so in
the present case howev where the reader is flood with whole
pipe barrel quart and gill of good gin and good cheer
at the time i devot three dai to the studiou digest of all thi
beer beef and bread dure which mani profound thought were
incident suggest to me capabl of a transcendent and platon
applic and furthermor i compil supplementari tabl of my
own touch the probabl quantiti of stockfish etc consum by
everi low dutch harpoon in that ancient greenland and spitzbergen
whale fisheri in the first place the amount of butter and texel and
leyden chees consum seem amaz i imput it though to their
natur unctuou natur be render still more unctuou by the
natur of their vocat and especi by their pursu their game
in those frigid polar sea on the veri coast of that esquimaux
countri where the convivi nativ pledg each other in bumper of
train oil
the quantiti of beer too is veri larg 10800 barrel now as those
polar fisheri could onli be prosecut in the short summer of that
climat so that the whole cruis of on of these dutch whalemen
includ the short voyag to and from the spitzbergen sea did not
much exce three month sai and reckon 30 men to each of their
fleet of 180 sail we have 5400 low dutch seamen in all therefor i
sai we have precis two barrel of beer per man for a twelv week
allow exclus of hi fair proport of that 550 anker of gin
now whether these gin and beer harpoon so fuddl as on might
fanci them to have been were the right sort of men to stand up in a
boat head and take good aim at fly whale thi would seem
somewhat improb yet thei did aim at them and hit them too but
thi wa veri far north be it rememb where beer agre well with
the constitut upon the equat in our southern fisheri beer would
be apt to make the harpoon sleepi at the masthead and boozi in hi
boat and grievou loss might ensu to nantucket and new bedford
but no more enough ha been said to show that the old dutch whaler of
two or three centuri ago were high liver and that the english
whaler have not neglect so excel an exampl for sai thei when
cruis in an empti ship if you can get noth better out of the
world get a good dinner out of it at least and thi empti the

but how now ishmael how is it that you a mere oarsman in the

me in hull england on of the whale port of that countri where
thei have some fine specimen of finback and other whale likewis
i have heard that in the museum of manchest in new hampshir thei
have what the proprietor call the onli perfect specimen of a
greenland or river whale in the unit state moreov at a place in
yorkshir england burton constabl by name a certain sir clifford
constabl ha in hi possess the skeleton of a sperm whale but of

in both case the strand whale to which these two skeleton
belong were origin claim by their proprietor upon similar
ground king tranquo seiz hi becaus he want it and sir
clifford becaus he wa lord of the seignori of those part sir
clifford whale ha been articul throughout so that like a great
chest of drawer you can open and shut him in all hi boni
cavitiesspread out hi rib like a gigant fanand swing all dai upon

the skeleton dimens i shall now proce to set down ar copi
verbatim from my right arm where i had them tattoo as in my wild
wander at that period there wa no other secur wai of preserv
such valuabl statist but as i wa crowd for space and wish
the other part of my bodi to remain a blank page for a poem i wa then
composingat least what untattoo part might remaini did not
troubl myself with the odd inch nor inde should inch at all
enter into a congeni admeasur of the whale
chapter ciii measur of the whale skeleton
in the first place i wish to lai befor you a particular plain
statement touch the live bulk of thi leviathan whose skeleton
we ar briefli to exhibit such a statement mai prove us here
accord to a care calcul i have made and which i partli base
upon captain scoresbi estim of seventi ton for the largest size
greenland whale of sixti feet in length accord to my care
calcul i sai a sperm whale of the largest magnitud between
eightyf and nineti feet in length and someth less than forti
feet in it fullest circumfer such a whale will weigh at least
nineti ton so that reckon thirteen men to a ton he would
consider outweigh the combin popul of a whole villag of on
thousand on hundr inhabit
think you not then that brain like yoke cattl should be put to
thi leviathan to make him at all budg to ani landsman imagin
have alreadi in variou wai put befor you hi skull spouthol
jaw teeth tail forehead fin and diver other part i shall now
simpli point out what is most interest in the gener bulk of hi
unobstruct bone but as the coloss skull embrac so veri larg a
proport of the entir extent of the skeleton as it is by far the
most complic part and as noth is to be repeat concern it
in thi chapter you must not fail to carri it in your mind or under
your arm as we proce otherwis you will not gain a complet notion
of the gener structur we ar about to view
in length the sperm whale skeleton at tranqu measur seventytwo
feet so that when fulli invest and extend in life he must have
been nineti feet long for in the whale the skeleton lose about on
fifth in length compar with the live bodi of thi seventytwo
feet hi skull and jaw compris some twenti feet leav some fifti
feet of plain backbon attach to thi backbon for someth less
than a third of it length wa the mighti circular basket of rib
which onc enclos hi vital to me thi vast ivoryrib chest
with the long unreliev spine extend far awai from it in a
straight line not a littl resembl the hull of a great ship newlaid
upon the stock when onli some twenti of her nake bowrib ar
insert and the keel is otherwis for the time but a long
disconnect timber
the rib were ten on a side the first to begin from the neck wa
nearli six feet long the second third and fourth were each
success longer till you came to the climax of the fifth or on
of the middl rib which measur eight feet and some inch from
that part the remain rib diminish till the tenth and last onli
span five feet and some inch in gener thick thei all bore
a seemli correspond to their length the middl rib were the most
arch in some of the arsacid thei ar us for beam whereon to lai
footpath bridg over small stream
in consid these rib i could not but be struck anew with the
circumst so various repeat in thi book that the skeleton of
the whale is by no mean the mould of hi invest form the largest of
the tranqu rib on of the middl on occupi that part of the
fish which in life is greatest in depth now the greatest depth of
the invest bodi of thi particular whale must have been at least
sixteen feet wherea the correspond rib measur but littl more
than eight feet so that thi rib onli convei half of the true notion
of the live magnitud of that part besid for some wai where i
now saw but a nake spine all that had been onc wrap round with
ton of ad bulk in flesh muscl blood and bowel still more for
the ampl fin i here saw but a few disord joint and in place of
the weighti and majest but boneless fluke an utter blank
how vain and foolish then thought i for timid untravel man to try
to comprehend aright thi wondrou whale by mere pore over hi
dead attenu skeleton stretch in thi peac wood no onli in
the heart of quickest peril onli when within the eddi of hi
angri fluke onli on the profound unbound sea can the fulli
invest whale be truli and livingli found out
but the spine for that the best wai we can consid it is with a
crane to pile it bone high up on end no speedi enterpris but now
it done it look much like pompei pillar

chapter civ the fossil whale
from hi mighti bulk the whale afford a most congeni theme whereon
to enlarg amplifi and gener expati would you you could not
compress him by good right he should onli be treat of in imperi
folio not to tell over again hi furlong from spiracl to tail and
the yard he measur about the waist onli think of the gigant
involut of hi intestin where thei lie in him like great cabl
and hauser coil awai in the subterranean orlopdeck of a
lineofbattleship
sinc i have undertaken to manhandl thi leviathan it behov me to
approv myself omnisci exhaust in the enterpris not
overlook the minutest semin germ of hi blood and spin him
out to the uttermost coil of hi bowel have alreadi describ him
in most of hi present habitatori and anatom peculiar it now
remain to magnifi him in an archolog fossilifer and
antediluvian point of view appli to ani other creatur than the
leviathanto an ant or a fleasuch portli term might justli be deem
unwarrant grandiloqu but when leviathan is the text the case
is alter fain am i to stagger to thi empris under the weightiest
word of the dictionari and here be it said that whenev it ha been
conveni to consult on in the cours of these dissert i have
invari us a huge quarto edit of johnson expressli purchas
for that purpos becaus that famou lexicograph uncommon person
bulk more fit him to compil a lexicon to be us by a whale author
like me
on often hear of writer that rise and swell with their subject
though it mai seem but an ordinari on how then with me write of
thi leviathan unconsci my chirographi expand into placard
capit give me a condor quill give me vesuviu crater for an
inkstand friend hold my arm for in the mere act of pen my
thought of thi leviathan thei weari me and make me faint with their
outreach comprehens of sweep as if to includ the whole
circl of the scienc and all the gener of whale and men and
mastodon past present and to come with all the revolv panorama
of empir on earth and throughout the whole univers not exclud
it suburb such and so magnifi is the virtu of a larg and
liber theme we expand to it bulk to produc a mighti book you
must choos a mighti theme no great and endur volum can ever be
written on the flea though mani there be who have tri it
er enter upon the subject of fossil whale i present my
credenti as a geologist by state that in my miscellan time i
have been a stonemason and also a great digger of ditch canal
and well winevault cellar and cistern of all sort likewis
by wai of preliminari i desir to remind the reader that while in the
earlier geolog strata there ar found the fossil of monster now
almost complet extinct the subsequ relic discov in what ar
call the tertiari format seem the connect or at ani rate
intercept link between the antichron creatur and those whose
remot poster ar said to have enter the ark all the fossil
whale hitherto discov belong to the tertiari period which is the
last preced the superfici format and though none of them
precis answer to ani known speci of the present time thei ar yet
suffici akin to them in gener respect to justifi their take
rank as cetacean fossil
detach broken fossil of preadamit whale fragment of their bone
and skeleton have within thirti year past at variou interv
been found at the base of the alp in lombardi in franc in england
in scotland and in the state of louisiana mississippi and alabama
among the more curiou of such remain is part of a skull which in the
year 1779 wa disint in the rue dauphin in pari a short street
open almost directli upon the palac of the tuileri and bone
disint in excav the great dock of antwerp in napoleon
time cuvier pronounc these fragment to have belong to some
utterli unknown leviathan speci
but by far the most wonder of all cetacean relic wa the almost
complet vast skeleton of an extinct monster found in the year 1842
on the plantat of judg creagh in alabama the awestricken
credul slave in the vicin took it for the bone of on of the
fallen angel the alabama doctor declar it a huge reptil and
bestow upon it the name of basilosauru but some specimen bone of
it be taken across the sea to owen the english anatomist it turn
out that thi alleg reptil wa a whale though of a depart
speci a signific illustr of the fact again and again
repeat in thi book that the skeleton of the whale furnish but
littl clue to the shape of hi fulli invest bodi so owen
rechristen the monster zeuglodon and in hi paper read befor the
london geolog societi pronounc it in substanc on of the most
extraordinari creatur which the mutat of the globe have blot
out of exist
when i stand among these mighti leviathan skeleton skull tusk
jaw rib and vertebr all character by partial resembl to
the exist breed of seamonst but at the same time bear on
the other hand similar affin to the annihil antichron
leviathan their incalcul senior i am by a flood born back to
that wondrou period er time itself can be said to have begun for
time began with man here saturn grei chao roll over me and i
obtain dim shudder glimps into those polar etern when
wedg bastion of ic press hard upon what ar now the tropic and
in all the 25000 mile of thi world circumfer not an
inhabit hand breadth of land wa visibl then the whole world
wa the whale and king of creation he left hi wake along the
present line of the and and the himmaleh who can show a pedigre
like leviathan ahab harpoon had shed older blood than the pharaoh
methuselah seem a schoolboi i look round to shake hand with shem i
am horrorstruck at thi antemosa unsourc exist of the
unspeak terror of the whale which have been befor all time
must need exist after all human ag ar over
but not alon ha thi leviathan left hi preadamit trace in the
stereotyp plate of natur and in limeston and marl bequeath hi
ancient bust but upon egyptian tablet whose antiqu seem to claim
for them an almost fossilifer charact we find the unmistak
print of hi fin in an apart of the great templ of denderah some
fifti year ago there wa discov upon the granit ceil a
sculptur and paint planispher abound in centaur griffin
and dolphin similar to the grotesqu figur on the celesti globe
of the modern glide among them old leviathan swam as of yore wa
there swim in that planispher centuri befor solomon wa
cradl
nor must there be omit anoth strang attest of the antiqu
of the whale in hi own osseou postdiluvian realiti as set down by
the vener john leo the old barbari travel
not far from the seasid thei have a templ the rafter and beam
of which ar made of whalebon for whale of a monstrou size ar
oftentim cast up dead upon that shore the common peopl imagin
that by a secret power bestow by god upon the templ no whale can
pass it without immedi death but the truth of the matter is that
on either side of the templ there ar rock that shoot two mile into
the sea and wound the whale when thei light upon em thei keep a
whale rib of an incred length for a miracl which ly upon the
ground with it convex part uppermost make an arch the head of which
cannot be reach by a man upon a camel back thi rib sai john
leo is said to have layn there a hundr year befor i saw it their
historian affirm that a prophet who prophesyd of mahomet came from
thi templ and some do not stand to assert that the prophet jona
wa cast forth by the whale at the base of the templ
in thi afric templ of the whale i leav you reader and if you be a

chapter cv doe the whale magnitud diminishwil he perish
inasmuch then as thi leviathan come flounder down upon us from
the headwat of the etern it mai be fitli inquir whether
in the long cours of hi gener he ha not degener from the
origin bulk of hi sire
but upon investig we find that not onli ar the whale of the
present dai superior in magnitud to those whose fossil remain ar
found in the tertiari system embrac a distinct geolog period
prior to man but of the whale found in that tertiari system those
belong to it latter format exce in size those of it earlier
on
of all the preadamit whale yet exhum by far the largest is the
alabama on mention in the last chapter and that wa less than
seventi feet in length in the skeleton wherea we have alreadi seen
that the tapemeasur give seventytwo feet for the skeleton of a
larg size modern whale and i have heard on whalemen author
that sperm whale have been captur near a hundr feet long at the
time of captur
but mai it not be that while the whale of the present hour ar an
advanc in magnitud upon those of all previou geolog period mai
it not be that sinc adam time thei have degener
assuredli we must conclud so if we ar to credit the account of
such gentlemen as plini and the ancient naturalist gener for
plini tell us of whale that embrac acr of live bulk and
aldrovandu of other which measur eight hundr feet in lengthrop
walk and thame tunnel of whale and even in the dai of bank and
soland cook naturalist we find a danish member of the academi
of scienc set down certain iceland whale reydansiskur or
wrinkl belli at on hundr and twenti yard that is three
hundr and sixti feet and lacpd the french naturalist in hi
elabor histori of whale in the veri begin of hi work page
3 set down the right whale at on hundr metr three hundr and
twentyeight feet and thi work wa publish so late as ad 1825
but will ani whaleman believ these stori no the whale of todai is
as big as hi ancestor in plini time and if ever i go where plini
is i a whaleman more than he wa will make bold to tell him so
becaus i cannot understand how it is that while the egyptian mummi
that were buri thousand of year befor even plini wa born do not
measur so much in their coffin as a modern kentuckian in hi sock
and while the cattl and other anim sculptur on the oldest
egyptian and nineveh tablet by the rel proport in which thei
ar drawn just as plainli prove that the highbr stallf prize
cattl of smithfield not onli equal but far exce in magnitud the
fattest of pharaoh fat kine in the face of all thi i will not
admit that of all anim the whale alon should have degener
but still anoth inquiri remain on often agit by the more
recondit nantucket whether ow to the almost omnisci
lookout at the masthead of the whaleship now penetr even
through behr strait and into the remotest secret drawer and
locker of the world and the thousand harpoon and lanc dart along
all continent coast the moot point is whether leviathan can long
endur so wide a chase and so remorseless a havoc whether he must not
at last be extermin from the water and the last whale like the
last man smoke hi last pipe and then himself evapor in the final
puff
compar the hump herd of whale with the hump herd of buffalo
which not forti year ago overspread by ten of thousand the
prairi of illinoi and missouri and shook their iron mane and
scowl with their thunderclot brow upon the site of popul
rivercapit where now the polit broker sell you land at a dollar
an inch in such a comparison an irresist argument would seem
furnish to show that the hunt whale cannot now escap speedi
extinct
but you must look at thi matter in everi light though so short a
period agonot a good lifetimeth censu of the buffalo in illinoi
exceed the censu of men now in london and though at the present dai
not on horn or hoof of them remain in all that region and though the
caus of thi wondrou extermin wa the spear of man yet the far
differ natur of the whalehunt peremptorili forbid so inglori
an end to the leviathan forti men in on ship hunt the sperm whale
for fortyeight month think thei have done extrem well and thank
god if at last thei carri home the oil of forti fish wherea in the
dai of the old canadian and indian hunter and trapper of the west
when the far west in whose sunset sun still rise wa a wilder
and a virgin the same number of moccasin men for the same number of
month mount on hors instead of sail in ship would have slain
not forti but forti thousand and more buffalo a fact that if need
were could be statist state
nor consid aright doe it seem ani argument in favor of the
gradual extinct of the sperm whale for exampl that in former
year the latter part of the last centuri sai these leviathan in
small pod were encount much often than at present and in
consequ the voyag were not so prolong and were also much more
remun becaus as ha been elsewher notic those whale
influenc by some view to safeti now swim the sea in immens
caravan so that to a larg degre the scatter solitari yoke
and pod and school of other dai ar now aggreg into vast but
wide separ unfrequ armi that is all and equal
fallaci seem the conceit that becaus the socal whalebon
whale no longer haunt mani ground in former year abound with
them henc that speci also is declin for thei ar onli be
driven from promontori to cape and if on coast is no longer enliven
with their jet then be sure some other and remot strand ha been
veri recent startl by the unfamiliar spectacl
furthermor concern these last mention leviathan thei have two
firm fortress which in all human probabl will for ever remain
impregn and as upon the invas of their vallei the frosti
swiss have retreat to their mountain so hunt from the savanna
and glade of the middl sea the whalebon whale can at last resort
to their polar citadel and dive under the ultim glassi barrier
and wall there come up among ici field and floe and in a charm
circl of everlast decemb bid defianc to all pursuit from man
but as perhap fifti of these whalebon whale ar harpoon for on
cachalot some philosoph of the forecastl have conclud that thi
posit havoc ha alreadi veri serious diminish their battalion
but though for some time past a number of these whale not less than
13000 have been annual slain on the nor west coast by the american
alon yet there ar consider which render even thi circumst
of littl or no account as an oppos argument in thi matter
natur as it is to be somewhat incredul concern the popul
of the more enorm creatur of the globe yet what shall we sai to
harto the historian of goa when he tell us that at on hunt the
king of siam took 4000 eleph that in those region eleph ar
numer as drove of cattl in the temper clime and there seem
no reason to doubt that if these eleph which have now been hunt
for thousand of year by semirami by poru by hannib and by all
the success monarch of the eastif thei still surviv there in
great number much more mai the great whale outlast all hunt sinc
he ha a pastur to expati in which is precis twice as larg as
all asia both america europ and africa new holland and all the
isl of the sea combin
moreov we ar to consid that from the presum great longev of
whale their probabl attain the ag of a centuri and more
therefor at ani on period of time sever distinct adult gener
must be contemporari and what that is we mai soon gain some idea of
by imagin all the graveyard cemeteri and famili vault of
creation yield up the live bodi of all the men women and
children who were aliv seventyf year ago and ad thi
countless host to the present human popul of the globe
wherefor for all these thing we account the whale immort in hi

befor the contin broke water he onc swam over the site of the
tuileri and windsor castl and the kremlin in noah flood he
despis noah ark and if ever the world is to be again flood like

captain ahab said the redden mate move further into the cabin
with a dare so strang respect and cautiou that it almost
seem not onli everi wai seek to avoid the slightest outward
manifest of itself but within also seem more than half
distrust of itself a better man than i might well pass over in
thee what he would quickli enough resent in a younger man ay and in
a happier captain ahab

as he quit the cabin paus for an instant and said thou hast
outrag not insult me sir but for that i ask thee not to bewar

pagan where strang to sai for all the heat of hi sweat he
caught a terribl chill which laps into a fever and at last after
some dai suffer laid him in hi hammock close to the veri sill
of the door of death how he wast and wast awai in those few
longling dai till there seem but littl left of him but hi

not a man of the crew but gave him up and as for queequeg himself
what he thought of hi case wa forcibl shown by a curiou favor he
ask he call on to him in the grei morn watch when the dai wa
just break and take hi hand said that while in nantucket he had
chanc to see certain littl cano of dark wood like the rich
warwood of hi nativ isl and upon inquiri he had learn that all
whalemen who di in nantucket were laid in those same dark cano
and that the fanci of be so laid had much pleas him for it wa
not unlik the custom of hi own race who after embalm a dead
warrior stretch him out in hi cano and so left him to be float
awai to the starri archipelago for not onli do thei believ that the
star ar isl but that far beyond all visibl horizon their own
mild uncontin sea interflow with the blue heaven and so form
the white breaker of the milki wai he ad that he shudder at the

but now that he had appar made everi prepar for death now
that hi coffin wa prove a good fit queequeg suddenli ralli soon
there seem no need of the carpent box and thereupon when some
express their delight surpris he in substanc said that the
caus of hi sudden convalesc wa thisat a critic moment he

and therefor had chang hi mind about dy he could not die yet
he aver thei ask him then whether to live or die wa a matter
of hi own sovereign will and pleasur he answer certainli in a

now there is thi noteworthi differ between savag and civil
that while a sick civil man mai be six month convalesc

out on hi bodi a complet theori of the heaven and the earth and a
mystic treatis on the art of attain truth so that queequeg in
hi own proper person wa a riddl to unfold a wondrou work in on

live heart beat against them and these mysteri were therefor
destin in the end to moulder awai with the live parchment whereon
thei were inscrib and so be unsolv to the last and thi thought
it must have been which suggest to ahab that wild exclam of hi

chapter cxv the pequod meet the bachelor
and jolli enough were the sight and the sound that came bear down
befor the wind some few week after ahab harpoon had been weld
it wa a nantucket ship the bachelor which had just wedg in her
last cask of oil and bolt down her burst hatch and now in
glad holidai apparel wa joyous though somewhat vainglori
sail round among the widelysepar ship on the ground previou
to point her prow for home
the three men at her masthead wore long streamer of narrow red
bunt at their hat from the stern a whaleboat wa suspend
bottom down and hang captiv from the bowsprit wa seen the long
lower jaw of the last whale thei had slain signal ensign and jack
of all color were fly from her rig on everi side sidewai
lash in each of her three basket top were two barrel of sperm
abov which in her topmast crosstre you saw slender breaker of
the same preciou fluid and nail to her main truck wa a brazen
lamp
as wa afterward learn the bachelor had met with the most
surpris success all the more wonder for that while cruis in
the same sea numer other vessel had gone entir month without
secur a singl fish not onli had barrel of beef and bread been
given awai to make room for the far more valuabl sperm but addit
supplement cask had been barter for from the ship she had met
and these were stow along the deck and in the captain and
offic stateroom even the cabin tabl itself had been knock into
kindlingwood and the cabin mess dine off the broad head of an
oilbutt lash down to the floor for a centrepiec in the
forecastl the sailor had actual caulk and pitch their chest
and fill them it wa humor ad that the cook had clap a
head on hi largest boiler and fill it that the steward had plug
hi spare coffeepot and fill it that the harpoon had head the
socket of their iron and fill them that inde everyth wa
fill with sperm except the captain pantaloon pocket and those
he reserv to thrust hi hand into in selfcomplac testimoni of
hi entir satisfact
as thi glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moodi pequod the
barbarian sound of enorm drum came from her forecastl and draw
still nearer a crowd of her men were seen stand round her huge
trypot which cover with the parchmentlik poke or stomach skin
of the black fish gave forth a loud roar to everi stroke of the
clench hand of the crew on the quarterdeck the mate and
harpoon were danc with the olivehu girl who had elop with

lord and master over all thi scene the captain stood erect on the
ship elev quarterdeck so that the whole rejoic drama wa
full befor him and seem mere contriv for hi own individu

lightningrod in the storm and stand close by a mast that hasnt
got ani lightningrod at all in a storm dont you see you
timberhead that no harm can come to the holder of the rod unless the
mast is first struck what ar you talk about then not on ship in
a hundr carri rod and ahabay man and all of uswer in no
more danger then in my poor opinion than all the crew in ten

with the electr beheld in heaven henc it is not to be much
marvel at that such thing should be in instanc where the

man well knew that to steer by transpoint needl though clumsili
practic wa not a thing to be pass over by superstiti
sailor without some shudder and evil portent

with a blow from the topmaul ahab knock off the steel head of the

him hold it upright without it touch the deck then with the

place the blunt needl endwis on the top of it and less strongli

at last when the ship drew near to the outskirt as it were of the

the dawn wa sail by a cluster of rocki islet the watchthen
head by flaskwa startl by a cry so plaintiv wild and
unearthlylik halfarticul wail of the ghost of all herod
murder innocentsthat on and all thei start from their reveri
and for the space of some moment stood or sat or lean all
transfixedli listen like the carv roman slave while that wild
cry remain within hear the christian or civil part of the
crew said it wa mermaid and shudder but the pagan harpoon
remain unappal yet the grei manxmanth oldest marin of

voic of newli drown men in the sea
below in hi hammock ahab did not hear of thi till grei dawn when he
came to the deck it wa then recount to him by flask not
unaccompani with hint dark mean he hollowli laugh and thu
explain the wonder
those rocki island the ship had pass were the resort of great
number of seal and some young seal that had lost their dam or
some dam that had lost their cub must have risen nigh the ship and
kept compani with her cry and sob with their human sort of
wail but thi onli the more affect some of them becaus most
marin cherish a veri superstiti feel about seal aris not
onli from their peculiar tone when in distress but also from the
human look of their round head and semiintellig face seen
peeringli upris from the water alongsid in the sea under certain
circumst seal have more than onc been mistaken for men
but the bode of the crew were destin to receiv a most plausibl
confirm in the fate of on of their number that morn at

and whether it wa that he wa not yet half wake from hi sleep for
sailor sometim go aloft in a transit state whether it wa thu
with the man there is now no tell but be that as it mai he had
not been long at hi perch when a cry wa hearda cry and a

and thu the first man of the pequod that mount the mast to look out
for the white whale on the white whale own peculiar ground that man
wa swallow up in the deep but few perhap thought of that at the

least as a portent for thei regard it not as a foreshadow of
evil in the futur but as the fulfil of an evil alreadi presag
thei declar that now thei knew the reason of those wild shriek thei
had heard the night befor but again the old manxman said nai
the lost lifebuoi wa now to be replac starbuck wa direct to see

it seem that somewhat late on the afternoon of the dai previou
while three of the stranger boat were engag with a shoal of
whale which had led them some four or five mile from the ship and
while thei were yet in swift chase to windward the white hump and head
of mobi dick had suddenli loom up out of the blue water not veri far
to leeward whereupon the fourth rig boata reserv onehad been
instantli lower in chase after a keen sail befor the wind thi
fourth boatth swiftest keel of allseem to have succeed in
fasteningat least as well as the man at the masthead could tell
anyth about it in the distanc he saw the diminish dot boat
and then a swift gleam of bubbl white water and after that noth
more whenc it wa conclud that the stricken whale must have
indefinit run awai with hi pursuer as often happen there wa
some apprehens but no posit alarm as yet the recal signal
were place in the rig dark came on and forc to pick up her
three far to windward boatser go in quest of the fourth on in the

but leav ahab almost without a scar
while daggoo and queequeg were stop the strain plank and as the

set sail to the rise wind the lone boat wa swiftli impel
to leeward by both oar and canva and at last when ahab wa slide
by the vessel so near as plainli to distinguish starbuck face as he
lean over the rail he hail him to turn the vessel about and
follow him not too swiftli at a judici interv glanc upward
he saw tashtego queequeg and daggoo eagerli mount to the three
masthead while the oarsmen were rock in the two stave boat
which had but just been hoist to the side and were busili at work in

he heard the hammer in the broken boat far other hammer seem
drive a nail into hi heart but he ralli and now mark that the
vane or flag wa gone from the mainmasthead he shout to tashtego
who had just gain that perch to descend again for anoth flag and
a hammer and nail and so nail it to the mast
whether fag by the three dai run chase and the resist to
hi swim in the knot hamper he bore or whether it wa some
latent deceit and malic in him whichev wa true the white
whale wai now began to abat as it seem from the boat so rapidli
near him onc more though inde the whale last start had not
been so long a on as befor and still as ahab glide over the wave
the unpiti shark accompani him and so pertinaci stuck to
the boat and so continu bit at the ply oar that the blade
becam jag and crunch and left small splinter in the sea at
almost everi dip
heed them not those teeth but give new rowlock to your oar pull
on ti the better rest the shark jaw than the yield water

suddenli cant the boat over that had it not been for the elev
part of the gunwal to which he then clung ahab would onc more have
been toss into the sea as it wa three of the oarsmenwho foreknew
not the precis instant of the dart and were therefor unprepar for
